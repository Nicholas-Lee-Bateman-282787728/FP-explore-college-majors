4580412,5,B0055SNHQ6,"When I heard last summer that NBC was creating a show about a call center in India I thought they (NBC) were crazy. In a down economy in the US, this incredibly stupid TV network (and let's face it, NBC is the worst network) was going to rub the outsourcing of American jobs in Americans faces. I had no intention of watching the series at all.

Then, after watching the show's lead-in, I didn't change the channel. I left the show on as background noise. I kept looking up from my laptop after hearing certain things on the show and by the end of the first show. By the time it was over I had to rewind and watch it again, only this time pay attention. The first episode hooked me. Turns out you CAN make an endearing, funny, and smart TV show about a call center in India. Who knew?

Outsourced is one of those shows that truly make you care about the characters. The writing was top-notch, the acting was terrific, and the story lines were consistently funny and poignant. In all seriousness, this was my favorite NEW show of the season. So naturally, I expected it to be cancelled... Heck, I expected it to be cancelled by its 5th episode, then by its 10th. When it made it to 22 episodes I thought maybe, just maybe, this show would wind up being a ""Jim Bulushi"" show, or ""King of Queens"", shows that don't make many waves but are consistently renewed because the cost was in line and the audience, while not huge, was good enough and always there... But, sadly no, it came down to the wire and NBC cancelled the show. And not a peep from the audience. I suppose it didn't matter to people.

I came to Amazon for weeks looking for a release date and preorder option for Outsourced on DVD. I'm buying this so that in the future I can watch these wonderful episodes and wonder what would have happened to these great characters.

And finally, if you don't already know, look for the movie from a few years back called ""Outsourced"", the show is based on the movie. Same characters, same premise, and some of the same personalities. I found the movie on Netflix. It was a very pleasant surprise, the movie was good, and I'd never heard about it before.",1308528000,14,2153,4.388471177944862
4580413,5,B0055SNHQ6,"NBC's Outsourced has had a bumpy roller coaster of a life. From premature assumptions before it even premiered to becoming NBC's highest rated new scripted series to getting stuck on the bubble awaiting its fate.

The comedy about an Indian call center for an American novelties company could be the biggest underdog story of the season outside of Dillon, Texas. Despite getting shuffled to a difficult timeslot (after doing very well in its original) and continuing to get unwarranted and baseless criticism from critics and some viewers alike, Outsourced forged ahead to grow into one of television's most charming series.

Outsourced doesn't drop a joke every other second like other shows may attempt to do, but you can't help but keep a smile on your face the entire half hour. Each episode always builds up to the satisfying punchline at the end and that is very refreshing.

The series is also relatable, a workplace comedy that uses its different and unique setting to its advantage.

Being set in India only adds to what makes the series so good. Outsourced puts a face behind those calls you make about products or support. They've managed to touch on how call centers are important and meaningful jobs for the locals in India (and the Philippines as well).

And those faces and personalities as just like you or me. They may have a different culture, faith, clothing, and food, but they go through the same things in everyday life; jobs, family, friends, romance. It's all there and with a talented, charming ensemble cast to bring it all to life.

Going against possibly what half of America thinks about the show (without even watching an episode), Outsourced is charming. The characters and cast are charming. You can't help but like these characters, each one of them contributing to the episode every week.

And maybe the most surprising, Outsourced has a lot of heart.

If you want a sample of just how good the series can be, look no further than the two episodes NBCU has submitted for Emmy consideration: Episode 11, ""A Sitar is Born"" and Episode 17, ""Todd's Holi War.""

Both are not only the funniest and most fun episodes of the season, but they are perfect showcases for the wonderfully talented cast. And one of the most refreshingly unique aspects of the series is that it isn't mean-spirited or cynical.

Outsourced is fresh, different, sweet, charming and one of the most enjoyable comedies on TV today",1308268800,83,2429,4.85956416464891

No, you are right outsourcing is not funny, in real life, but guess what moron, this is a TV SHOW! If you take everything so seriously all the time then you're a waste human life. THE SHOW IS FUNNY!

This show is so FUNNY  definitely much better than todays current sitcoms (e.g. The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, etc.). I don't understand why NBC didn't keep it on for several years.

4580490,4,B0055SNHQ6,"I loved the series (loosely based on the movie of the same name) but the last few episodes were not that funny, either they knew they were being cancelled and the writers threw the towel or they run out of ideas, anyway a good collection to keep that allows repeated views.",1464652800,,273,4.372549019607843
4580491,4,B0055SNHQ6,"This is an American comedy set in an Indian call center, with the kind of jokes that will make politically correct people angrier than Michael Moore at a Republican Weight Watchers class. If you're super sensitive, easily offended, have no sense of humor, no real friends, and life is so miserable that you're jealous of other people's happiness and try to make them miserable too, then it's probably better to give this show a miss and go watch the Muppets (but only the early ones, before Kermit became misogynistic towards Miss Piggy, and Animal was still attending anger management classes). On the other hand if you like the sound of hee hee, ha ha and the occasional guffaw then you'll probably enjoy this.

Actually I found the humor quite tame. Sure it's full of stereotypes, but who isn't. I know I am. I'm so full of stereotypes that I can't find clothes big enough to fit me. I had two stereotypes just last week and three the week before that. Every summer for the last sixteen years I've gone to sit with 'The Sony Super Stereotype Society Circle', in Stockholm, Sweden. It's always full of tall blonde gorgeous girls, and men with funny accents. Don't hide your stereotypes. Embrace them. Set them free. Let them run wild like a sea horse across the Serengeti... Okay, I think I overstretched myself a bit there.

This DVD Is worth buying. If only to shut me up!",1464307200,4,1376,4.635245901639344

4580512,5,B0055SNHQ6,"Hilarious and underrated show.  This show had lots of heart, very original plot-lines involving cultural clashes/misunderstandings, and was incredibly well written and produced.  As a person whose parents emigrated from India, I was worried this show would be racist, but on the contrary, the themes were very well researched.  I especially loved the scene where the meaning and origin of the swastika was explained to Todd by Rajeev.  Todd is culturally unaware about India since he grew up in Wisconsin and was thrown into a foreign land, but never is he mean or unwilling to learn how other people live.  Of course this is a comedy (and a very funny one), so characters are grandiose and situations contrived, but my entire family and I loved the show and what it tried to accomplish.",1455494400,,787,4.887218045112782
4580513,5,B0055SNHQ6,"I still cannot believe the short life of this show on NBC, it was pure great comedy as its best!

4580553,5,B0055SNHQ6,"The movie was complete garbage, but the series is fantastic. Every episode is funny and the jokes move right along without being goofy.  I can see a lot of the material with the Indian characters reflected in my co-workers, which makes it even better.  I watched all three discs over the weekend then took it to work to share with friends.  They love it, too.  This is one series that should have been renewed.",1453334400,,410,4.5
4580554,5,B0055SNHQ6,"I made it a point to watch this series after stumbling across the movie that inspired it.  Oh my gosh......I love it.  I felt like I'd discovered a hidden gem after the first episode.  I'm so incredibly sad there is only one season!  I grew up overseas attending schools with people of all different backgrounds and nationalities, and maybe that's why I ""get it"".  I found the characters to be funny and charming, and each episode had me laughing.  You can't be overly sensitive to stereotypes if you watch this.  It's all in good fun!  I really enjoyed the fact that it was different from the typical sitcom you see on t.v. these days.  I was never bored with the scenery (Mumbai).  The actor playing Gupta was phenomenal.  My husband and I absolutely loved him. His comedic timing is perfection!  As always Diedrick Bader is fantastic and lovable. Ben Rappaport is super cute :)  And the actress playing Madhuri....I just loved her!  She's lovely and hilarious!  The actor playing Manmeet is spot on too.  Rebecca Hazlewood (Asha) is stunning.  They all did fantastic.  I'm so so so so so disappointed that this wasn't picked up for a second season.",1452902400,,1151,4.698492462311558

Funnier than community,  silicon Valley and even friends in some respects. I find myself laughing out loud in every episode.  Something about this show just resonates with me.

This series turns it on its head by showing us that people are people, wanting the best for their families and trying to get ahead despite the problems that come with the culture. Our American culture is looked at with different eyes, just as we examine a foreign culture that is more bazaar than ours. Having worked in India, this series has everything but the poverty and the smell. It reminds me that one time, a long time ago, I had to learn my job for the first time. Everyone in this series is doing just that. Very funny, with no laugh track. This is one you can watch over and over - like a 'Fish called Wanda' or 'Best in Show'.

4580639,4,B0055SNHQ6,"This is a sometimes hilarious, racist, tender, sweet, moving, colorful, inventive, sexy and perceptive series. It uses a sitcom format to highlight topics around the outsourcing process and clashes of different cultures. It uses the medium of comedy to bring a lot of ""teaching moments"" about the indian culture and to show how challenging it can be to understand another culture without putting yourself in their shoes. It lampoons both the seeming absurdity of what Indians believe and act as well as the same about Americans. Everyone in the cast gets to be the fool and the rational one. Since good comedy is built on good contrasts, this show really had the possibility of a long life and of maturing into a classic modern sitcom like Seinfeld. In fact, it would have been awesome to see what the Seinfeld staff could have brought to tighten up the show. The casting is nearly flawless, amazing actors that play their roles to the hilt.

Unfortunately NBC needs to remain bland and unfunny (except for their level of news integrity), so something with this level of curry had to scurry. It could also have to do with NBC/Universal being owned by the Comcast behemoth, which, as many of their reluctant customers know, outsources THEIR call center to the Phillipines. Maybe Comcast felt that the fact they are one of the bigger ""outsourcers"" to a country that gives us ""Taglish"" -speaking assistance was cutting too close to the bone to keep this great series alive.

Well, like the ""Police Squad"" shows, at least what little of this gem of a series was created has been preserved for posterity on DVD. 3 discs and no commercials (except the garbage they layer in the front of all commercial DVDs). We can only dream that a more creative broadcaster steps up and rehabilitates the series with as much of the existing cast they can get. Amazon, are you available??

Meanwhile leave Comcast to their core values of continuing to try destroying the Internet as well as what little remains of watchable commercial TV while strong-arming us into paying through the nose and polluting our democracy.",1426291200,8,2097,4.851955307262569

Like another reviewer mentioned, this was a charming, very funny show. I loved all the characters and I just wish that more people would have given this show another look and not take the show so seriously because of the whole job outsourcing thing. Companies will continue to keep sending jobs to other countries, this was just about a fictional guy who tries to make it in another country and it was done without insulting anyone who has lost a job.
I just wished that NetFlix or another network would have picked this up and continued with it especially since so many people clearly enjoyed it.",1414627200,2,718,4.530769230769231

4580715,5,B0055SNHQ6,"Great series! Too bad there was only one season--but the season they had was fantastic!

A young man who works for a novelty product manufacturer is sent to India to run a company telephone call-center outsourced to that country. Discovering the customs and foibles of the colorful locals and acclimating to the culture of India are a true adventure for him.

Did I say colorful locals? A few complained about that because they were Indian. But, after all, this IS a COMEDY; colorful locals are a staple of the medium! (To prove a point: Anyone ever see ""Northern Exposure"", ""Men in Trees"", ""Picket Fences, or about a million other examples of colorful locals used in a plethora of different ""Fish out of Water"" series.) Well, enough on that score.

Now, back to the show:
He even finds love in India--and more than one! Dederich Bader is a bit over the top (as usual) as a clueless fellow American who wrongly thinks he has the culture down pat and who befriends the green American newbie upon his initial arrival in India, insisting on showing him the ropes. But, even his character eventually grew on me after a while. It does take a few episodes for the cast and characters to really gel, but once they do, this series becomes a very entertaining and enjoyable television show. I will actually use the word ""charming"" to describe it (and I don't associate that word with TV shows very often). I was really very sorry to see this series cancelled.

The production values are amazing for a 30 minute sitcom! Through the windows running along an entire wall of the call-center we see a very well done Indian street set with bikes, motorcycles, peddlers and pedestrians constantly filing through it. A lot of the series' action actually takes place outside the call-center on this impressive street set. Even the show's lighting and cinematography is on a level that is rarely seen in 30 minute situation comedies (in fact, I can name a number of dramas that don't have anything on this level).

It seems that NBC had great expectations for this well reviewed series (except for a few critics who were alarmed that some of the more outlandish Indian characters might have been taken as insulting to ALL Indians without, apparently, noticing that, aside from the show's main character, virtually ALL of the American characters were also laughable lunatics). A lot of money was obviously spent on this show, but the ratings required to keep a sitcom that cost as much as ""Outsourced"" did never really materialized and NBC pulled the plug after only one season without giving it a chance to ""find it's audience"" over time.

There are story arcs for some of the characters which are concluded by the final episode of the series, so, as a viewer, there is certainly a nice sense of overall satisfaction received from the final episode, but I can't help wishing there had been more seasons of this show to enjoy. Well, at least the one they had was very well done.

My own copy of the complete series is always being loaned out, so, I'm apparently not the only one who has a fond affection for this very enjoyable TV show.

The quality of the discs is very good (both the picture and sound are top-flight for a DVD) and the series is a true bargain at this wonderfully low price.

The DVD set includes deleted scenes (some of which really enhance one particular running story line) and if you were a fan of this show when it was first being aired, these will be welcome extras for you.

I think that this series would make a nice addition to any TV show collectors library.",1411776000,2,3567,4.647619047619048

4580755,5,B0055SNHQ6,"First of all it is on 3 dvds. It is a complete story. It is hilarious. Being from that part of the globe myself I find some things inappropriate, but that is exactly the point of the show. the rest is all right. The production, direction, videography is second to none. I thought it would be some cheapo production but it is top notch. It is insanely funny. Actually multiple times funnier than that stupid ""how I met your mother"" which was not funny at all and I never watched a full episode of that, couldn't, doesn't catch your attention.

Originally I was looking for a documentary that I caught a glimpse of on tv. A man had to downsize and his job was outsourced and he complained about how he had to give up a house and move into an apartment. He decided to go to India to see how this outsourcing was working. He found that his replacement made a fraction of the money he made and oversaw more people and lived in a one room apartment with something like 7 people and took the bus in scorching heat to work. While searching for this documentary I found the movie called ""outsourced"", a very amusing film. However the tv show, now on DVD is way funnier.

I did at one point spray a mouthful of tea all over my living room carpet.
I did not research this but i have seen some of the actors in some Canadian made films.
o have mo bad feelings that the show ended after so few seasons. It is a very complete story on DVD, funny and uplifting. I was surprised by the positive behavior of some people who were being spun as negative as is done in American movies  - good guys vs bad guys- but such is the nature of places like south Asia. Also cultural characteristics and attitudes have been presented quite well. There is not a single dull moment in this show. But I do believe that the viewer must know something of this region's culture or if u have friends from that region, your appreciation of the show will be better.

I hope this review is helpful.

I think the reason this show didn't last was because people weren't sure if it was making fun of Indians or was being racist. It isn't. The shows successfully exploits the fact that most Americans, rich or poor, educated or ignorant, really don't actually know that much about India. The show's main character, Todd, portrays this ignorance well. Even when he is trying to be extra culturally sensitive, he sometimes sticks his foot in his mouth (naturally, to humorous consequence). I think most of us can find at least a little bit of ourselves in Todd.

The show's exploration of the cultural divide between America and India is honest, understated, and, I felt, tasteful. Such a backdrop sets the show apart from your more typical sitcom, while still offering enough story and romance to keep people interested. I heartily recommend Outsourced for Americans, Indians, and everyone else.

4580793,1,B0055SNHQ6,"I watched every episode on this 3 cd set. The set is beautiful, the actors and actresses
are really good, the shots of the Bombay area are spotlessly but unrealistically beautiful,
various elements of the plot highlight the issues that a newcomer to India would encounter,
the music is wonderful, and the viewer gets a sense of what it is like when different cultures
meet at the crossroads.

Nevertheless, the producers blew this opportunity big time to reasonably present a light hearted comedy
series. What we have instead is a picture of sex hungry westerners (young and old, American and
Australian alike), whose religion is a farce, and for whom profiting on sleazy products is just
another business enterprise.

The series begins with the presentation of Asian Indian employees who are constantly being surprised
by the moral character of Westerners (the products they use, the fleeting intimate relationships
between men and women focused on sex, the lack of inhibition in drinking or talking about sex, the moral
looseness they display when coming together for social activities such as a football game or a marriage).
It also presents the Indians as family oriented, hungry for career success, subjected to parental authority,
religious, modest in dress, having high regard for the social structure of a family, respectful of authority,
cautious about loosely touching the opposite sex, giving high value to arranged marriage, deep commitment to
marriage and sexual purity.

The series ends with the conquest of the displayed Western values over the Eastern as the Indian employees
in varying stages succumb to the culture of the west. Some of the scenes in the last 2 episodes really belong
in a porn show, not family TV hour. Is this what the West is really about? No, but unfortunately Hollywood has
become our spokesmen to the world. No wonder the non westerners have such a low view of us. Read thru all the
opinions on this DVD thread and you will be surprised by how many people are not at all bothered by how we are
presented to the world. I bought this DVD after reading their opinions and you can rest assured I would never
view this DVD again.",1379635200,4,2164,4.907103825136612

They tentatively pointed out how could we be in a  monsoon season calling from a desert state...so, hopefully, I left a good impression, that me trying to reach out simply,negated some, at least, of the hating in the world....

Outsourcing has moved a lot of American jobs to India, but on TV it's actually bringing more jobs to Studio City. The new NBC comedy Outsourced has set up studio space at the CBS Radford lot, at the corner of Radford Avenue and Ventura Boulevard
The show stars Ben Rappaport and Diedrich Bader as Americans running Indian call centers for American companies. A cast of Indian American actors joins them as the local staff of the call center.
The Radford lot provides a sense of history to the show's young actors. ""It's awesome,"" Rappaport said. ""You know, Gilligan's Island was there, Gunsmoke. We're right across the alleyway from where Seinfeld was shot.  It's just like a real magical feeling walking onto that lot.""
Parvesh Cheena plays one of the call center workers, but he is a California local. Working at the Radford lot is convenient for him. ""It's close to my apartment,"" Cheena said.
Sacha Dhawan, who plays the operator Manmeet, just moved to Studio City from the United Kingdom. Like Cheena, he's settled in near his studio. ""I've moved over here to start shooting, and I live in Studio City now, and I can jog to work in about 20 minutes,"" Dhawan said. ""I love it. We did a lot of work at Universal Studios, which is quite a big lot. What's great about Radford is it's small, it's intimate and it's just right for the show and it's very close to where I live.""
You probably remember Bader as Oswald the delivery man on The Drew Carey Show. That show filmed on the vast Warner Brothers studio lot in Burbank. Bader is enjoying the more close-knit feel of Radford.
Already, Bader has discovered the treasure troves of television lore buried within the walls of CBS Radford. ""There's been a lot of great shows that shot there,"" Bader said. ""Seinfeld was there, so there's a great history to it. I love that, because I'm a studio geek. I love walking around and seeing what sets they're constructing. That's one of the reasons I love Warner Brothers so much because there was always so many new things happening. There's a sign that says Elaine's [still at Radford]. I'm not exactly sure why that's there. I don't know but it's nice to have that vibe. That was certainly a fantastic show.""
You are quite likely to see the Bader family shopping around Studio City. Diedrich and his wife, Dulcy, have already discovered places to eat and shop. Dulcy will hit Levine Custom Framing and then take the kids for treats at Gelato Bar.
""They have a great sorbet place, actually great gelato and sorbet,"" Dulcy said. ""It's across from Vitello's on Tujunga. We have a frame guy that we love. He does a brilliant job framing, named Steve Levine, so we go there, and our kids love to frame things now so we always take them to Gelato after.""
The Bader family plans to continue exploring Tujunga Avenue, so look for them on the street. ""We like the Tujunga area,"" Diedrich said. ""We like that little strip there. They're nice shops and restaurants in the middle of that kind of stuff. It reminds us of Larchmont, where we're closer too.""
Though new in town, Dhawan has already discovered a local eatery he likes. You may see him there on mornings before work. ""There's a really nice little place I go for breakfast called Studio Caf, which I like,"" Dhawan said. ""It's right near CBS. That's great for breakfast.""
With the studio located on what is often referred to as ""sushi alley,"" co-star Cheena prefers to dine after work. ""There's a late-night sushi place across the street, too,"" Cheena added.
So Outsourced is set in Mumbai. How exactly do they recreate Mumbai in Studio City? Producers sent a crew to film actual locations. The studio actors get inserted into the backdrops with special effects.
""We were doing it on green screen,"" Rappaport said. ""So it was me and Rizwan [Manji] sitting in the rickshaw, and there was a guy behind us with a 2-by-4 shaking the rickshaw, checking his texts every once in a while.""
Even the Indian actors are American or British. Few of the cast have actually been to Mumbai. ""I'm from Chicago,"" Cheena said. ""Then we've got a couple of New Yorkers and some Brits, too.  I think now you're just seeing a lot of us on one network also, which has been great.  NBC's been a good home for a lot of ethnic diversity.""
The Americans bring the culture clash to the call center, and therein lies the comedy. Meet Bader's character, Charlie, an American who's been in Mumbai for years, but hasn't quite adjusted.
""I love Charlie because he's the guy who really says what everybody is thinking,"" Bader said. ""He's one of those types, and it's not exclusively American, like a French will want to go and hang out in the French community when they go to, say, Germany or something like that.  I remember when I was a kid in France, there'd be a Mickey D's there, and I would think, 'Why would an American come all the way here and go to Mickey D's? ' Well, a guy like Charlie would be that guy.  He would be that guy that would be at McDonald's going, 'I just want what I want.  Give it to me.  I want it hot.'""
He even brings peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with Cheetos to work so he doesn't have to eat Indian food in the cafeteria. ""He just tries to replicate his world wherever he goes, and for him, it's really just a job, but it's not without interest.  But the interest is mostly that he gets paid.""
You'll meet all the characters of Outsourced when the show premieres this fall. Once they're famous, we'll see how long they can roam Studio City freely. For now, they're excited to represent a new culture that most TV audiences haven't seen before.
""A call-center job back in India is a really highly prestigious job,"" Cheena said. ""There's a whole different culture of people where they had to open, depending on which time zone you're working for, you have to have like your lunchtime, your after-work kind of bar thing.  My mom was back in India when I found out [I got the part], just visiting, and I called right before I got on the plane, and the whole family at the wedding just freaked out and erupted, and they're excited.""",1344384000,,6155,4.567934782608695

4580844,4,B0055SNHQ6,"Outsourced was the one sitcom different from the pack. Besides being very entertainingly funny, this one takes the viewer to a place very foreign from our normal, and brought people to us that we never see on American TV fare. What this did was to allow the writers to formulate plots and story lines vastly different from the norm. Indian life, customs, practices, the daily life of Indians with a Kansas City guy mixed in created a wealth of possibilities for the writers to work with. They did a great job, and the actors bring it all to life with very talented and convincing performances. The DVD production is high quality and the low price makes this set a real steal of a deal.",1338854400,3,685,4.532258064516129

I'm upset they only ran one season when it deserves to still be on air because the only other show I like on NBC is The office. When I was watching this series when it first aired I thought this was a winner compared to some of the other dumb NBC shows that are continuing to run. Someone needs to overlook this show and plan on bringing it back because it definitely deserves it by a long shot. These actors deserve some spotlight and now you look them up on IMDB and they don't have much going for them, such a shame.

4580846,4,B0055SNHQ6,"This is really a review of two ""Outsourced.""  There are the first three episodes and then there is the rest of the series.

The first three episodes can only be described as poor.  Predictably, these were merely a rehash of the movie.  What was startling was how they made every effort to dumb-it-down.  This was amazing because the movie could hardly be described as cerebral entertainment. (It sadly reminded me of why I got rid of my television years ago.)  The characters were one-dimensional, and given their ethnic character could almost be described as insulting.  Although they acknowledge the time difference between the US and India, everyone showed up to work in the morning and went home in the evening.  This was completely baffling and ignored the day/night lack of synchronisation which is pivotal to the entire Indian call-centre culture.

But by about the fourth or fifth episode, the show freed itself from the film and developed its own style.  In the process it became a very good show.  The characters became more human and multi-dimensional.  The show even began to be educational by introducing aspects of Indian life that were unfamiliar to most people (e.g., caroms, paan)  However their attempts at explaining arranged marriages never quite hit the mark.  (I never met my wife until the day of the marriage proposal.) The humour was subtle enough that you didn't feel like you were being hit over the head with it.

Many decry NBC's decision to axe the show.  Perhaps the network felt that they had to cancel it to make room for something truly bad so that they could maintain their poor reputation. (Cynical? - moi?)  I think that by cancelling it they actually did the show, its actors, and producers a favour.  They saved the show from that terrible fate which inevitably hits a show that has been on too long.  That is when the actors become tired. Everything that can be done has already been done. Even worse is when the writers and producers feel that they have to ""jump the shark"" to infuse life into a dying show.  By cancelling it when they did, they left behind a very nice legacy.

All things considered. I feel that this really was a good show.",1334016000,2,2183,4.737400530503979

The characters are diverse and I felt the show brought awareness to Indian AND American culture.

Others seem to take offense that a show brings laughter to the subject of ""jobs being outsourced"". Perhaps the show can bring awareness to us Americans via humour that if we want to keep jobs in America then we must be willing to pay more for products to have benefits and a healthy lifestyle. If products become too expensive, then perhaps we don't really need to buy a bunch of novelties that will end up in the trash.

4580869,5,B0055SNHQ6,"The people portrayed were authentic representations of south asian people. The Hindi accents were good. The street and train scenes were especially good and realistic. The only thing to make it more realistic would be to have a curry simmering on the stove for background ambience. The basic premise, that wherever your office is located in the world, you're going to have problems, reverberates from some  universal truths. Getting along with others in close quarters is difficult. The people who seem like your enemies can be your best allies. The people who seem like your friends can do you the most harm. The best laid plans can be derailed with a simple flick of a switch. A lack of a common core of experience is usually the basis for miscommunication. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Many more truths are portrayed subtly and cleverly. The clash between Indian and American cultures is reduced, although in a very small scale, with the publication of this series. The misconceptions each country has about the other is a constant source of amusement and is amply displayed in this entertaining series. If you've ever had a yearning to be anywhere near India and learn a little about a culture that is one of the fastest growing in the world, you couldn't do better than getting this little slice of south asian spice.

4580870,3,B0055SNHQ6,"This one season series attempted to 'make light' of what (then) seemed like a brief economic downturn in the American economy. Attempt to remind audiences that laughter is the best medicine for what ails them!

In an era of reality TV, this sitcom about an American employee named Todd Dempsey transferred overseas seemed like a good idea at the drawing board: He has the new job of explaining American culture to the Indian call center employees of Mid-American Novelties. Meanwhile, they familiarize him with Indian ways and customs. This is so he will successfully live in his new country. Rather than being the ultra-competent 'know-it-all' who does no wrong, a running storyline has Dempsey making several gaffes during his own job orientation period.

The show was perhaps trying to promote 'cross-cultural exchange' as the important workplace concept. And people do grow from learning about each other's customs and laws.

The workers and supervisor do come together to support one another as a gennuine surrogate family. Madhuri, whose call center wages support her entire family, is encouraged to showcase a beautiful singing voice in a contest. These people don't just clock out at the end of a day, they liked spending leisure time with each other.

But the well-intentioned plot works much better in schools--rather than having been targeted at people who are first worried about how to pay bills. It also might have been hard for intended American audiences to find this subject material funny or ironically trustworthy in the face of prolonged unemployment.

During a better economy, this series just could have been considered 'interesting' or 'creative'. It ultimately suffered from the timing of it's same creativity.

In a couple of years, the series might help somebody write a media-political paper examining issues around unemployment and American jobs going overseas.",1317427200,3,1889,5.259136212624584

Also the writing and humor I feel is lazy since they sell freakin novelty products really they could not come up with anything better than that. The finale is at least a little more interesting since it involves a wedding. I might rent to see if a complete run through changes my mind and to see if the special features reveal any insight.

When I first saw the promos for this show I thought it looked too tame and bland, but boy was I surprised when I actually started to watch episodes.

This unusual and thoughtfully entertaining show dared to take a funny but plausible look at cultural stereotypes and was able to laugh at them, both the real ones and the imagined ones. Upon looking a bit deeper, this office setting was not so different from others in the past in terms of characters: the one who doesn't know how awkward he is, the shy one with a personality waiting to burst forth, the good looking guy struggling to make it work with anyone, the model who isn't as perfect as she seems. But to place all this in India with the culturally ignorant American trying to cope is brilliant. As an American who lived in India for three years, I can attest to the authenticity of the scenario.

Many seem to think that any form of ethnic humor borders on racism which is hardly the case, it all depends on context and application.

4580900,4,B0055SNHQ6,"Well, they went and dropped the axe on another show I liked. I'm starting to think it's personal. Based on a romantic comedy pseudo-Bollywood film that flew under the radar in 2009, OUTSOURCED was a promising new show from NBC. It offers a smile-inducing glance at life in Mumbai, India. It's what happens when Todd Dempsy (Ben Rappaport) relocates there to keep his job at the Mid-America Novelties company. In Mumbai, Todd heads up a call center manned by rustic Hindi employees who are unanimously in the dark when it comes to the American way of life. East meets West in a culture clash, differing philosophies and world views collide, and all this brought into a sort of perspective by the presence of plastic vomit and whoopie cushions.

Todd Dempsy - stranger in a strange land - is our eyes and ears, our point of view character, and we go thru his acclimation period and his initial cluelessness regarding the do's and don'ts in India. He inadvertently violates pretty much all the social rules, and his misadventures are written well enough that they play for good laughs. Not that he comes off as a bumbly clown. He's more like a regular dude who skipped orientation day and is now paying for it.

I was wondering whether the cast would be able to maintain the funny. I was dreading that one-trick pony, which is the humor in the culture clash. But the writers have made these characters so quirky and appealing enough that what happens to them matters to the viewer. Todd's call center crew is comprised of oddballs, but personable oddballs, and so credit the very likable Indian actors. And they're not even as peculiar as Todd's new American pal, Charlie. Dietrick Bader, who is pretty terrific, injects some serious weird into ""Charlie."" Here's him expounding on how the locals try to fool foreigners about their holidays: ""For Elephant Day, my workers tricked me into painting my face and walking around with the pockets pulled out of my pants. It was all fun and games 'til I whipped out the trunk."" Charlie is kinda creepy, as well.

Any sitcom worth its salt would have to have a love story and the more unrequited, the better. In Mumbai, Todd becomes torn between two women: the carefree Australian babe, Tonya (Pippa Black), and the beautiful Indian girl, Asha (Rebecca Hazlewood), who is undergoing the process of an arranged marriage. At this point, this romantic thread can go anywhere. Todd initially falls for Asha, but Tonya is so winsome.

I love the constant shifts in perspective. One moment we look at a situation from Todd's viewpoint. The next, we're presented with his employees' side of things, and there's a jarring dissimilarity. One day Todd cautions his crew about Black Friday and how things can rapidly get out of hand with the pushing and the shoving and the rioting, and the crew laughs at him. One worker even scoffs: ""You call that a riot?"" And then, en route to a team building retreat, the workers are dismayed by Todd's sheer inability to muscle his way on board a train (mostly because they have to keep getting off to wait for the next one). And so we're reminded of India's vast population. It's tiny, throwaway touches like that that I relish. The western viewer gets an education AND some good laughs. Those uninitiated will get exposed to Bollywood, that movie industry woven into the very fabric of Indian culture (You'll hear the cast drop names like ""Hrithik Roshan"" and ""Aishwarya Rai"" and if you don't know who those are, you are missing out big). We pick up social cues such as that kissing in public is very frowned upon and that it's okay for dudes to dance with each other in a club, although I personally don't think it's ever okay for dudes to dance with each other anywhere (sorry, guess I'm not open-minded on everything). Each week explores that irresistible fish-out-of-water theme. Each week delivers offbeat dialogue and madcap scrapes and a stretching out of that ""Is it Asha or is it Tonya?"" thread. I was also waiting for the episode which never came, in which Charlie gets put in prison. He's funny. But way creepy.

Favorite episodes are ""Jolly Windaloo Day"" (fooled into thinking it's a national holiday, Todd gives his workers the day off), ""Touched by an Angelo"" (the call center receives a shipment of risque novelty items), ""Bolloween"" (Todd tries to explain the concept of Halloween and then throws a Halloween costume party), and ""Training Day"" (the staff go on a retreat while Tonya gives Charlie pointers on how to pick up chicks). Parvesh Cheena as the chubby, good-natured Gupta is damn lovable. And I'm sorry, but one of the characters - Manmeet - has a name that just makes me laugh out loud every time I hear it.

NBC, you guys rather suck.",1308614400,60,4730,4.741190765492102
4580901,5,B0055SNHQ6,"This is my review of the SHOW and not the DVD release due in September.
Outsourced had to have one of the finest cast ensembles on current comedy television. The show seemed to balance itself between being a comedy, and showcasing a tiny bit of culture from India...just touching on the merits of traditional-vs-modern styles of behavior from both sides of the world.
The comedy aspects were what one could expect from modern-day American tastes...some of which were not my own taste...however, what kept me really coming back to watch this show week after week were the heart-felt, endearing, and rich characterizations brought to the people in the show by what must be the most underrated cast performances on TV.
The face of the show is the unsophisticated American in the middle of India, learning the culture differences the hard way in the midst of an outsourced office. The employees are learning too of some American culture, (though not our best), and the dance of comedy-of-errors begins. But wait...there is something else in this show...feeling. Real feeling. Some would say hart, or even darn good acting.
 The actors in Outsourced are so talented that it pains me that their abilities were not seen or appriciated by the mainstream. I felt a sincerety that managed to amuse and draw me closer to the characters, and left me wanting to know more about them.
Each character was a true, human form of a type, rather than a shallow parody of same...for example, the 'hard-line' manager, Rajiv, was not entirely without sweetness and concern for his fellow countrymen's well being, despite the class differences that permitted him to ""talk down"" to his subordinates.
This sort of deep characterization is not new to cinema, but to American comedy television it is certainly a rare occurance, and this show was brimming with such talent.
There were moments where the show teetered in the 'other' direction of it's fellow sitcoms...particularly when Diedrich Bader (of the Drew Carey show...which I really liked), was in the scene, of being a little to silly or over the top. However, they never lost sight of the real charm and draw of the show, and that was the stories of each individual and the utterly enchanting way each actor warmed his or her way into our hearts, beconing us to just walk with them into a little realm of lovely stories about lovely people.
I have definitely pre-ordered this gem of comedy television; I am truly sorry to see it end prematurely and I only hope and pray that the outstanding talents of the actors in this series will find a home in the industry that will allow them to continue to do what so little of the industry does...entertain us with joy.",1308614400,12,2692,4.8268398268398265
