8191886,4,B000PIU28C,"A 1964 transition concert if you will, with Davis, Shorter, Hancock, Carter, and Williams still playing the old and by this point rather overdone repertoire.  Sound quality is better than the video, but neither interferes with the quality of the music.",1413763200,,252,5.146341463414634
8191887,4,B000PIU28C,Great musicians shown truly making music in the moment. However the audio and video could be alot better.,1286841600,,105,4.888888888888889
8191888,5,B000PIU28C,"Let`s see - I`m buying a dvd that`s lifted from a European TV broadcast back in 1964 highlighting the most fantastic jazz quintet that (arguably) ever existed, and instead of marvelling in its incredible historical importance or wonderful if not frighteningly fabulous performances, I`m gonna wallow in the fact that the picture isn`t great??? What`s WRONG with these people??? Granted, the picture image isn`t so hot if you`re watching on your hi-def big screen, so watch it on your computer monitor instead, where the images aren`t so fuzzy, and sit w/ your jaw agape over the players on fire instead. Problem solved. The photography has multiple imperfections (cameramen never knew who to focus on during solos - but this is true in ALL 50`s/60`s jazz dvd`s), but jeez, we`re talkin` Miles w/ THE Quintet, for chrissakes... Tony Williams was only 18 years old, and listen to him take the wheel for a blissful joyride w/ Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and the BIG DOG of jazz w/ the equally big attitude. Get a grip, fellas, the sound is fine , and the performances great. Grab one while you still can, now that it`s out of print.",1266710400,5,1143,4.807106598984771
8191889,3,B000PIU28C,"The Miles Davis Quintet plays
a really good show on this DVD-
the music is fantastic!

But the image quality is horrible.
This was taken from a vintage TV broadcast,
and not much has been done to fix it up.

The picture is watchable-
but at times it looks fuzzy and compressed,
with little pixels that make it look like
it was downloaded off the internet!

If Miles Davis wasn't on this disc
I would have only given it one star.",1210723200,6,428,4.2592592592592595
8191890,1,B000PIU28C,Buyer Beware!!! The image quality of this DVD is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch!!! It looks like a 10th generation copy. It  pixilated so badly that it is not viewable!!!,1209600000,5,184,4.411764705882353
8191891,5,B000PIU28C,"this was Miles Davis with Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, wayne Shorter and Ron Carter. Prime time Miles Davis and the band was on Point. Miles was so Productive and Prolific during this particular time period. hard to believe this is the same man who only a few years later would go fully into electric fusion and change his whole musical direction. but this time period captures another very important time period in his creativity.",1209600000,4,433,4.864864864864865
8191892,5,B000PIU28C,"This is the wonderful 1960s quintet with Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. It was a TV show and is in very good shape soundwise. It's an ideal complement to the Jazz Icons series that Reelin' In The Years has release. This is the new Quintet with the old repertoire. There is a European Tour 1965 TV show from the same source but a year later with the new repertoire.",1191801600,12,394,4.410958904109589
