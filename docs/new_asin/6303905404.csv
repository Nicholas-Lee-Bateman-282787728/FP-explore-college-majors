723218,4,6303905404,"I saw this film a while back at a friends house...I wasn't expecting much since it was my first silent film but boy was I surprised. Since then I've become a lover of silent films, Louise Brooks being my favourite, but Garbo is wonderful in this film as well as Mata Hari [ which I also recommend ] though I was younger when I saw this film I certainly recommend it to any hardcore silent film fan!",977529600,3,398,4.181818181818182
723304,1,6303905404,The other reviewer is right in calling this severely truncated -- it's missing several vital scenes. And the Kino VHS has better image quality. Wish I had watched it sooner so I could return it. Save your money!,1297900800,5,211,4.578947368421052
723305,1,6303905404,"Awfully cutted version, 30 minutes shorter than written on the disc. And film is not from 1927, but from 1925",1294444800,3,109,4.5
723306,1,6303905404,"An excellent movie, but stay away from the 60 minute USA version which cut out everything but Garbo. I love Garbo, but there's so much more to the story. For now the only restored DVD (142 minutes)is available from Austria filmmuseum and in May 2009 from the German filmmuseum (148 minutes). They both have English subtitles. However they are in the PAL format (Europe), not the NTSC format (USA) so they will not work in your DVD player. You'll have to view them on your pc and they are expensive to ship over.",1230508800,15,511,4.505376344086022
723307,5,6303905404,"Whether you are a Garbo fan or interested in Germany during the 1920s, the film is a dramatization of conditions that then existed. This was Garbo's second screen performance and it's outstanding. Never seen anything else that captured the period so well. Very interesting and well worth the expense.",1213315200,,300,5.142857142857143
723308,5,6303905404,"In this film there is a scene where Garbo is standing in a meat ration line and faints. While I have not seen her credited, as I guess she wasn't a big name yet, Marlene Dietrich caught her and cradled her in her arms. Deitrich denied being in the movie for most of her life. It is said that she and Garbo were lovers for a short time, and that didn't end well. She and Garbo were mortal enemies, and even pretended not to have  met each other! Please see The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood by Diana McLlean for more juicy tidbits, and more on this movie!",1200528000,3,556,4.148148148148148
723309,1,6303905404,"This edition of ""The Joyless Street"" is a severely truncated version of the film.  It runs for about 60 minutes, which includes a brief introduction.  Yes, there are many versions of this film out there which vary widely in length--the only other version I've seen is the longer and more complete Kino VHS--but this has got be one of the shortest.  Almost all the material with Asta Nielsen is excised.  The disc lists the runtime at 90 minutes for some reason.  Beware.",1194134400,39,470,4.682926829268292
723310,4,6303905404,"The Joyless Street is famous for being butchered.  Each European country edited it to suit their nationalist leanings and or censorship board demands.  Many nationalities were less than thrilled with how they were portrayed in this epic early film by G.W. Pabst from 1924.

  Others have written reviews so rather than duplicate their efforts, I will simply tell the viewer that this edition, Synergy Video, has a running time of 90 mins. which leads me to believe this is the French release from 1981 (albeit remastered onto DVD format).

  Jan-Christopher Horak has written a superlative history of this film and to him I would direct the serious film buff for further explanation about the butchery this film has been subjected to.

  Mr. Horak's research tells us that we may never see this film the way G.W. Pabst intended.  Isn't it a pity...",1193184000,12,848,4.894366197183099
723311,3,6303905404,"I'm glad to see that someone is starting to release more of Garbo's silents. The 3-star rating is mainly for the movie itself and not the actual DVD. I'll give Synergy points for having initiative but this DVD is far from perfect. There is no interactive menu or bonus features. Once you put the DVD in you will see the usual copyright warning and then the movie just starts. Once the movie ends it will automatically restart itself so it's basically just in a continuous loop. The copy of the movie that was used here appears to be the same re-issue edition one from my old VHS copy. Also, there doesn't seem to be any signs of a restoration. Some parts are scratchy and it seems like it was directly transferred from a VHS copy. The only thing about this that's different from the VHS version is that there is a musical score. Don't expect anything on a Carl Davis level though, it's pretty much just classical music, but it's better than nothing. So, once again, it's not perfect, but if you're a Garbo fan it might be worth $9.99 to you.",1192924800,9,1041,4.427083333333333
723312,1,6303905404,"This particular version of JOYLESS STREET is described as running 126 minutes, which is the running time of the best-restored version of the film. However, in actual fact, this VHS from Timeless Video is the truncated 60-minute version. SO DO NOT BE FOOLED. JOYLESS STREET features the stories of two women: the daughter of an immpoverished army veteran and the daughter of a retired civil servant. Both have fallen on hard times in the post-WWI era and both feel responsible enough for their families to compromise their morality in exchange for food and the trappings of wealth. Greta Garbo plays the daughter of the civil servant, and, after she moved to Hollywood and became famous, the film was re-released to feature her, practically eliminating the second and far more tragic story. So, while I highly recommend the fully restored version of the film, I want to warn buyers to be sure that that is the version they are getting. This one is not it.",1166659200,18,954,4.823170731707317
723313,5,6303905404,"Thrilling to see Garbo's first film!  You get wisps of what is to come, mannerisms that evolve through Mata Hari into Camille.  A must for any Garbo fan.",1107561600,,153,4.428571428571429
7854487,1,6303905404,Sending this copy back. I wish Kino would release it on DVD.  This is a masterpiece.  This also has no music track and it is hacked to bits.  Very disappointed.,1510358400,,160,4.266666666666667
7854488,1,6303905404,"Received the VHS TIMELESS VIDEO INC. ""version"" today,  I mistakenly purchased this seeing the ""Running Time: Approximate 126 Minutes""  shown on the back of the sleeve in the picture posted on Amazon and on the sleeve of the tape I received.  When I removed the plastic wrap and took the tape out of the sleeve,  a sticker on the cassette states ""Timeless Multimedia Entertainment""  ""JOYLESS STREET""  ""Silent 61 min"" in small print.  This is totally false advertising, and it is going back.",1440806400,4,489,4.890243902439025
7854489,1,6303905404,"Amazon should pull this film especially as FilmRise does not know their own products. Only 60 minutes, even though the Box advertises 125 minutes.  So sad.",1425686400,6,155,4.961538461538462
7854490,3,6303905404,"The film is only 65 minutes, not the 125 as the jacket says.  It's also a 1925 film and not 1927 as printed on the case.
Nevertheless, the story is complete and except for the annoying pauses between the different music, the score nicely supports the story.",1424736000,2,257,4.468085106382978
7854491,1,6303905404,"This is a heavily edited version of a movie that should run for almost two hours. Virtually all scenes involving the film's co-star, Asta Nielson, have been cut. Search out and buy the complete version!",1424649600,4,202,4.8
7854492,5,6303905404,This is a great work by an important classic film director.,1420329600,,59,4.454545454545454
7854493,1,6303905404,Amazon ought to be ashamed of itself for selling this without noting it is half the movie. I ordered it in batch of 11 Garbo movies without reading comments. It gets 3 out of 5 stars. It deserves none. Yet I'm forced to give it a star.,1402704000,,235,4.0212765957446805
7854494,3,6303905404,"The Amazon description says The Joyless Street was made in 1927, but it was not...it was made in 1925. The DVD case states the movie is 90 minutes, but this DVD isn't. It is 60 minutes. Even on the back of this DVD case it says 90 minutes, but it really isn't! Anyhow, all that aside, I bought this to see Greta Garbo and I wasn't disappointed. She was only 19, but already has that wonderful face and way with expressing herself and is very emotionally convincing.
From what I gather, Asta Nielsen's character in the movie was edited out; thus the shorter movie. And, indeed, she is only in the beginning of the movie for a short few scenes, as is the butcher. I would like to see the whole movie, but apparently it's only available on VHS, which was too pricey for a VHS for me. And, since my main reason for buying the movie was to see Garbo, I settled for this DVD.
A few of the title cards are dark during the movie, so you have to really look to read a couple of them, but they are visible. The music for the movie is Mozart, I believe. Although, I think Mozart is a little too light for this movie, at least it is pleasant. (Don't get me wrong, I love Mozart, I just think a custom score would have been a bonus.)
In summary, Garbo fans will be delighted to see her in this movie.",1358985600,,1287,4.152
7854495,1,6303905404,"My ratingt relates to the DVD, not the film. The seller did not mention that this is the heavily cut 61 minute version that eradicates the Asta Nielsen story completely, thus removing Werner Kraus from the film as well, apart from the butcher shop scene early on. Some omission! and information that the prospective purchaser needs to know. And it states on the box that the movie is 1 hour 30 minutes long ... most misleading. And the Mozart becomes very irritating after a while, it's so inappropriate in its unrelenting jolliness .. I watched the film silent after ten minutes of it ... there is a place for everything, and Mozart and Pabst's Joyless Street are in different solar systems ....",1354838400,7,696,4.713114754098361
7854496,3,6303905404,"The good new is that this film is available in a fairly good print on DVD; the bad news is that it is only 60 min., half the length that is listed for the product here on Amazon; hopefully they will correct this error. There are multiple lengths listed for his film on IMDb.  Though not a great film, it was interestingly filmed and entertaining; it also completes my Garbo film collection.  She is unique and I have always wanted to see ""Joyless Street"", therefore I will keep it and hope a more complete version of this with a good print will be released in the future.",1312329600,4,571,4.327102803738318
