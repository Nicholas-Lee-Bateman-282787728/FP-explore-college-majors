2830910,1,B000Q677F4,You are better off hunting down the original release on e-bay (unless you do not already own UFC 43 & UFC 52).  This package sucks for people like me that collect UFC and Pride events.  Why should I be forced to buy a second copy of 43 and 52 just because there was a distribution problem and the original UFC 57 only had limited circulation.,1189209600,4,342,4.246153846153846
2830911,2,B000Q677F4,"Why Dana White is feeling the need to beat up my wallet like it's in an MMA match is beyond me. I suppose if I didn't own every UFC I would be glad and this would be a deal but, since I do already have two copies of UFC 43 both in boxset and on its own, I really don't need another. They should have packaged this fight as a standalone as well. Besides, from a moronic standpoint I enjoy looking with pride down my dvd rack at all of my UFC's yellow/ bold print and numbers in sequential order! Yeah, I have issues but alas, you know I had to bend on buying this! The bonus material is kinda lame as is the packaging hence my 2 star rating but as far as the fight goes...great 5 stars to the class of Randy! Glad he's back after the loss and champion again! If you're new to MMA, buy it...buy everything!!! Check out Pride and WEC as well.",1188950400,4,839,4.0
2830912,5,B000Q677F4,"Well, After being lost in the shuffle for well over a year because of a distribution problem/change over and only being released on a extremely limited run (through mail order DVD clubs) UFC 57: Liddell v. Couture 3 has finally seen the light of day and packed together w/ UFC 43 & 52. They call it Liddell vs. Couture: The Trilogy Box Set (Digipak)

UFC 57 Liddell v. Couture 3 is 2 discs. The 1st disc has the entire event, except for the walk in's, though liddell/couture are shown. The 2nd disc has a 20 minute liddell/couture behind the scenes feature that follows both fighters around before and after their classic 3rd encounter. It also has a 7 minute return of frank mir feature. Nothing extremely important, I kinda wish they added more to the 4th disc, they definitely had enough room to do so.

UFC 43 & UFC 52 are the exact same discs from there previous releases.",1188604800,11,877,4.509433962264151

I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about this set, mainly because it's the only cost-effective way to get 57 (seriously, it's $75 on Amazon [emphasis]used[/emphasis]). However, if you don't own 43 or 52, it's a great set. If you do own either or both, get this set anyway. If you need to, sell the other copies you have and get some money back, or use the others in this set as backup discs. Content-wise, these are excellent DVDs with amazing fights and the special features we've come to expect. Do your collection a favor and get this set.",1293753600,,1517,5.530172413793103
8194272,5,B000Q677F4,"This 4 disk set of dvds in great!  Features all 3 fights between the two great warriors, PLUS every fight that was on all 3 of those cards so it's like buying all 3 of those UFC dvds, but this one is dedicated to those 2 fighting greats! I'm a total fan of both men, but I won lots of money betting on Chuck! THANKS CHUCK!",1282003200,,322,3.878787878787879
8194273,5,B000Q677F4,I wasn't too pissed of like many others that they didn't release UFC 57 on a seperate disc (you can actually buy it at Amazon UK but it cost about the same as this collection). Here you get 3 shows basically for the price of 2 so unless you own both UFC 43 and 52 you should be pretty happy.,1208736000,,291,3.8666666666666667
8194274,5,B000Q677F4,"Don't let the 1 star reviews fool you. They already had one or two of the 3 events that this set includes. The third one is not available anywhere(except ebay) so this set is worth it if you don't have any of the three. This is a great trilogy set, not only because of the Couture vs Liddell matches, but because of the whole events of all 3. UFC 52 is by far one of the best UFC events I have even seen. Very much worth it!

8194275,1,B000Q677F4,"Why on Earth would the UFC treat their dedicated fans like this?  I too have collected all the Pride events and UFC events via DVD over the last few years.  I want 57 only as I already spent good money on the other two UFC DVDs.  Even on their website they don't offer 57 separately.  It makes no sense.  It's like saying, hey all you guys that love us and pay for our DVD events, if you want 57, you have to buy two duplicates you already own and waste your money.  It really bugs me.  If anyone knows where to get a UFC57 DVD.  Please let me know.  I'm not even going to buy from the UFC website anymore after this.",1201564800,,617,3.9918032786885247

8194277,1,B000Q677F4,"Packaging this with two other UFCs is a cheap marketing trick :(

Not happy with the UFC marketing department.",1190073600,,110,4.7894736842105265
8194278,1,B000Q677F4,"I've been waiting for the release of 57 for over two years. Finally it's out, and whoopteedoo, I need to purchase 43 and 52 - which I already own - as well? Why would they do this?

First, they make it exclusive to credit card orders through underpaid operators.

Then, they advertise the Ultimate Iceman DVD, as containing Randy/Chuck 3. Well, that was false advertising taken to the nth degree. They just show you the last 5 seconds. Otherwise, they're just freeze frames.

Now, they're forcing me to buy two DVD I already own... I wish the UFC would take a page out of the WWE's DVD department. They not only release their DVDs a few weeks after their PPVs, but they also don't edit/cut all the entrances, prefight/postfight interviews.",1189468800,5,739,4.6692307692307695
