823290,5,6304285728,"This 1974 special is one in a long series of Como's traditional holiday shows which he began presenting on TV in 1948.  The annual tradition continued until the mid 1980s although he did a final show from Ireland in the 1990s.

The guest stars include Rich Little and Peggy Fleming but for me The Carpenters really stand out.  Particularly memorable is a medley with Perry and Karen where they share singing some of their most popular favorites.  The DVD runs a total of 80 min. and the extras include a present-day Richard Carpenter talking about Como's TV career and the admiration he and Karen had for him.

It should be noted that very few complete Como shows have been available on home video and I believe this to be the first to be given an official DVD release.  With this greatly anticipated event, frustrated Como fans might finally have reason to hope that more may be coming before too long.",1384128000,18,903,4.6125
823291,5,6304285728,"Perry Como's Christmas Show broadcast on December 17, 1974 is a real treat.  Perry's guests are The Carpenters, Peggy Fleming and Rich Little.  The musical numbers are excellent and much of the comedy comes from impressionist Rich Little who during the course of the show impersonates Raymond Burr, Jackie Gleason, Howard Cosell, Johnny Carson, John Wayne & Perry himself.  But the funniest and cutest moment is when he impersonates Jack Benny playing Santa Claus and the surprised and totally ad-libbed reaction of a little girl to a joke.  But as always the best moments are the musical numbers (as well as Peggy Fleming's wonderful skaing solos) and Perry's telling of the First Christmas.

823292,5,6304285728,"This is a set of two of Como's legendary Christmas shows. In the first, EARLY AMERICAN CHRISTMAS (1978), Perry and crew visit Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia to bring us a colorful and tuneful look at an early American Christmas celebration. A fife and drum corps featuring a young drummer gives Perry an opportunity to sing ""The Little Drummer Boy"". Perry is our guide as we visit many of the local shops and crafts people. Guests include Diana Canova (the daughter of Judy Canova), a lovely young lady, who does a fine job singing several solos, and duets with Perry. The young violinist Eugene Fodor, a Tchaikovsky Competition winner, treats us to a solo. Of interest to John Wayne fans is the big man himself making one of his final appearances and even briefly raises his voice in song! Perry doesn't disappoint and sings a number of songs appropriate to the holiday season. This show was videotaped and the quality of the transfer to VHS is excellent.

The second show, from 1980, is the Emmy-awarded CHRISTMAS IN THE HOLY LAND.  It takes us to Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the Galilee region and shows us a number of impressive sites having great historical and religious significance.  Appropriate entertainment is ably provided by Israeli singers and dancers including Illanit, a talented singer with an endearing personality. Perry Como sings in his inimitable style and serves as our guide along with a bearded Richard Chamberlain.

As of today, neither of these shows has been released on DVD.",1381968000,3,1504,4.9563492063492065
823293,5,6304285728,"This is one of the most memorable Christmas television specials from the 1970's and I am thrilled that somebody saw fit to release this on DVD!  Perry Como, himself a music icon, was fortunate enough to secure the hottest American music act of the 1970's -- The Carpenters. They were and still remain the most successful brother and sister act in music history! Karen Carpenter introduced more standards in American popular music than any other female vocalist of the decade, and in this classic TV Special, Como generously features the young superstar throughout.

Among the musical highlights: Karen, Perry and Richard perform a medley of their respective hits, including ""Catch A Falling Star,"" ""Yesterday Once More,"" ""Don't Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes,"" ""Close To You"" and a stunning rendition of ""It's Impossible"" from Karen, who was twenty-four at the time. Christmas songs include ""Sleep Well Little Children"" from both Karen and Perry, the Carpenters' then new Christmas single ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,"" and much, much more.

This is sure to make Christmas Eve 2013 a very special evening in many homes.  I definitely recommend it.

UPDATE 11/6/13: Got my copy in the mail today and I am so pleased. The video quality is very good for an almost forty year old television special, and Karen Carpenter is just a doll. Perry Como's great and so is Rich Little with his wonderful impersonations.  God bless them all.",1380067200,60,1430,4.9375

Wish they would make the sound like they do today when the BAD GUY is KILLING everyone, like what we have unfortunately in all our shows today!

The musical numbers are beautifully performed along with the very festive Christmas backdrops. The biggest reason I purchased this dvd is because it features The Carpenters!  Being a big fan of theirs, especially for their Christmas music, it is the only way to see them perform on a show, until  Richard Carpenter hopefully releases their two Christmas specials on dvd.

My only complaint as a conservative Christian is Pegg Fleming's costume from the 1st time she skates is a bit risqu and she almost has some ""wardrobe malfunctions"" with the top of it that make it uncomfortable to watch. Other than that, I love Perry's singing and Rich Little as Edith Bunker was hilarious... not a big  Carpenters fan, but they were talented, although Karen looks a little odd as she sings... my favorite was the meaning of Christmas...very accurate except for the wise men part coming so soon after the birth...we really enjoy Perry!",1463184000,,614,4.7924528301886795

It's pretty typical of Christmas-themed variety shows of the era (this was 1974), so you know more or less what to expect: comedy, music, dance numbers, guest stars. Big plus, this particular special is wall-to-wall Christmas whereas some other specials from the era weren't. If there is a negative here it would be that Como doesn't really carry his own show--Rich Little does that. But he does genuinely seem to be having a good time, and it's infectious--which is exactly what you want in a Christmas special. Recommended.",1450483200,,628,4.770642201834862

824603,5,6304285728,Wonderful stroll down memory lane for us who were there watch the show first hand.  Perry Como brought much love and sincerity to each and every one of his performances.

824605,4,6304285728,"I purchased this for my mom for Christmas.  She loves old Christmas shows and I thought this would be fun.  She also likes Perry Como (so do I).

The show is enjoyable.  My mom said she was a little disappointed, that it wasn't the kind of special she'd watch over and over again.  I think I liked it more than she did.  But I agree, I can't see watching it repeatedly.  I didn't like it as much as the Osmonds Christmas show dvd, which I've watched numerous times.  My mom loves that one, too.  This a nice, pleasant Christmas special, but just seemed to be lacking something which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  But it's definitely worth buying if you like this kind of program.  You certainly don't see anything like this on tv anymore.",1393027200,5,742,4.304347826086956
824706,5,6304285728,Oh how I miss these holiday specials!  What is Christmas without Perry?! It is so good to hear him sing and so neat to see the Carpenters. A great trip back in time!,1391472000,,165,4.0
824707,4,6304285728,"I loved the show. My mother and I have loved Perry Como for more years than I care to think about! He has the most mellow voice! The DVD brought back memories, but the quality was not the best,",1390694400,2,193,3.9743589743589745
824708,5,6304285728,"If you enjoy good Christmas TV specials, you have to get this Perry Como video. He has great guest stars on it (including the Carpenters) and a good Christmas message of what Christmas is really all about.",1390694400,,205,4.5675675675675675
824709,5,6304285728,"In my opinion, this is not the best of his Christmas Shows. However, it is excellent and is the only one which was available.  I am very happy with it. It is an excellent broadcast and it brings back happy memories of the annual Christmas Show he put on.  Perry Como had a way of being able to bring joy to many and put people into the proper Christmas spirit!",1390176000,4,360,4.128571428571429
824710,5,6304285728,"I purchased this as a gift for my parents.  Perry's Christmas Show was from a time when there were real old fashioned specials on TV.  We watched this several times over Christmas.  Loved Perry Como's Christmas songs and they take me back to my young childhood.  It is like buying a memory.

Would recommend to anyone who truly loves pure entertainment.",1390003200,3,353,4.721311475409836

824712,5,6304285728,"After watching this wonderful Christmas Show (Perry Como and guests), it's now part of my every holiday viewing of
pure entertainment. Perry has always been a part of family entertainment and no doubt this show brings back what
Christmas Specials are all about...entertaining.  Rich Little was very entertaining with his impressions of other people,
along with the magical voice and music of The Carpenters. It can't get any better.",1389398400,2,432,5.260869565217392
824713,4,6304285728,Really enjoyed this DVD .  Grew up listening to Mr. C and this takes you back to those times.  Very good.,1389139200,,105,3.9523809523809526
824714,4,6304285728,"As a Como fan, I was happy to see this released, and hope that more Como specials might follow.

Lowlights?  Well, actually only one.  Most of the songs Perry ""sings"" are actually just lip-synced from his albums.  Not all, but most.  Not sure why.  They obviously had the orchestra and he seemed in fine voice on several numbers.

But, Como here is light and pleasant and puts you in the Christmas spirit.  Rich Little is along for the ride, and is very good here.  I particularly broke up when...well, watch for the adlibbing little girl in the Santa Claus skit!  And of course, there's the famous duet with The Carpenters; certainly a classic as Como sings a few of their hits and they sing a few of his.  (Richard Carpenter seems to be a true admirer of Como, based on some other projects).

It's nice to remember that for many years, Como was Christmas!",1389052800,3,857,4.4935064935064934
824715,5,6304285728,"I cannot say enough about this wonderful visit to Christmastime 1974.  There are so many positive, memorable moments here: Perry's and Karen Carpenter's gentle, superbly talented singing; Peggy Fleming's graceful and elegant skating; Rich Little's truly funny impersonations and comedy skits with Perry; and, above all, Perry's heartfelt and moving presentation of the Nativity, as he did annually on his television show in the 1950's and '60's.  The only sad aspect of this DVD is that it will remind you of how much  talentless, negative, vile material is presented as ""entertainment"" on present-day television.  But I digress.  From a technical standpoint, prepare to be amazed at the excellent picture and sound of this now forty-year-old videotape. I sincerely hope that Perry's other Christmas shows, such as his specials from the Holy Land, New York and Austria, are made available to us on DVD.  Hey, Richard Carpenter, can you lend your support to this?  Merry Christmas!",1388793600,7,980,5.283870967741936
824853,5,6304285728,"I remember watching this when it aired originally. It was so great to be able to see it again. As a huge  fan of the Carpenters, it is a dream come true to have ANY video recording of  Karen.  There is nothing better than hearing Perry Como and Karen and Richard sing the medley of each other's hits. Personally, I believe Perry and Karen have the purest, most honest voices  of all time.  The whole special  is very entertaining. I especially like the story of the first Christmas at the end-reminding us what the  season is really about. Bonus for Carpenters fans:  bonus features include commentary from Richard about the show.",1388707200,3,630,4.612612612612613
824854,5,6304285728,"And what a special treat this is.  The print has been remastered and looks just as good, if not better, than the first time it aired in 1974. This is all do with special thanks to MPI Home Video.

This is the  first-ever release on disc for this classic holiday production! This single-disc is only 52 minutes (I wish they would have included other holiday specials, but this is a great start).

This special has been unseen anywhere since its one and only CBS-TV broadcast on December 17, 1974, PERRY COMO'S CHRISTMAS SHOW presents the host with special musical guests THE CARPENTERS along with Olympics skating star PEGGY FLEMMING and comedy great RICH LITTLE.

Both PERRY COMO and THE CARPENTERS are embraced for their top-selling Christmas music and among the popular favorites featured on this colorful spectacular are ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" (Como), ""Toyland"" (Como), ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" (The Carpenters), ""Sleep Well Little Children"" (Como & Karen Carpenter) and ""Carol Of The Bells"" (Richard Carpenter). Additionally, Perry and The Carpenters team for a medley of each others' million-selling hits, including ""Close To You,"" ""It's Impossible,"" ""Yesterday Once More,"" ""And I Love You So"" and ""We've Only Just Begun.""

Peggy Fleming performs a beautifully choreographed ice skating production of ""The Christmas Waltz"" and the entire cast join together for ""It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas"" in a scene that recreates the Currier & Ives style Christmases of old. Perry closes the show with his elaborate ""Story of Christmas"" presentation, singing traditional carols ""The First Noel,"" ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" and ""Silent Night,"" followed by an encore with ""O Holy Night."" PERRY COMO'S CHRISTMAS SHOW is the type of old-fashioned, star-studded and lavishly-produced family TV special that gives viewers a warm, nostalgic glow at the holidays.

Do yourself a real solid, purchase this disc so it's in your collection next Christmas.  There's little that will help you get into the holidays than a special from the crooner of all crooners, Perry Como.",1388707200,3,2093,5.171597633136095

824858,5,6304285728,"Take a trip back in time to 1974 for this great well staged program. Perry Como's rendition of many Christmas songs, are some of the very best, and this program starts out with one of them. Guest stars Rich Little, Peggy Fleming, Karen and Richard Carpenter, add a touch of nostalgia to the show.  Higly Recommended",1388102400,,315,4.625

But what a shame it was shown on British tv  (  bbc 4 ) before it was given as a Christmas present  it was only released to buy in USA in  November 2013. Hope there will more released coz there are a lot to choose from Perry Como made a Christmas show every year for many a year.,1388102400,,315,3.727272727272727
824861,5,6304285728,I purchased this for my 81 year old mom.  We sat down and watched this together and it made the both of us cry.  It was a wonderful trip back to my childhood.  Anyone who is a Perry Como fan or even remembers watching this on tv as a child should get it.,1388016000,,254,3.7547169811320753
824862,2,6304285728,"I didn't find much Christmas themed music here. I was looking forward to the Carpenters, but Como sang their songs & they sang his, which was weird & un-entertaining. I like the guy & his voice, but this was really not a Christmas show, nor was it a good waste of money",1387843200,2,269,4.1923076923076925

825037,5,6304285728,"Rich Little was funny as always. Great to see the Carpenters perform ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"". Very nice to hear an alternate saxaphone solo that is not on the single version (1972) or the album, ""An Old Fashioned Christmas"" (1984). Karen looks absolutely radiant! The Como/Carpenters medley is nice also. Unfortunately, the first few songs were cut due to time constraints but is available on the Carpenters 2002 album, ""As Time Goes By"". This is a good thing since Karen's rendidtion of ""Catch A Falling Star"" is my favorite out of the entire medley. I was very surprised and extremely happy to see Richard Carpenter in the extras section discussing various aspects of Mr. Como's career. It was very interesting!",1387843200,2,721,4.918032786885246
825038,5,6304285728,"We had been searching for years, to find Perry Como,s Christmas shows on DVD, with no luck, so when I found this, I had to give it a try. We were so pleased with it, that  it,s hard to express in words how wonderful we felt while watching Perry and the Carpenters bring the joy of Christmas into our home.  Memories like these are so difficult to come by, so when we find some, it renews the true spirit of Christmas, the spirit which seems to have turned cold through the years. This particular DVD has a clear, remastered copy of one of Perry Como,s Christmas specials with the fabulous Karen and Richard Carpenter as his guest artists. They perform flawless arrangements of the Christmas favorites, as well as new songs and newly arranged carols which take us back to the holidays we recall from years gone by. If anyone is depressed, for whatever reason, after viewing this show, they will most likely be lifted up and recall the true meaning of Christmas.",1387756800,,960,4.543352601156069

The, ahem, older folks enjoy reminiscing about the ""good old days"" when they watched the specials on TV and the younger generation like to express their good-natured horror at the styles of the age. Though the fashion may be a bit dated, the musical and figure skating performances in PCCS are still entertaining and the show is over all too soon.",1387497600,2,478,5.063291139240507

825042,5,6304285728,"I loved this - terrific music, costumes, sets and everything else.  Perry and The Carpenters are some of America's all time best singers.  The skating sequences with Peggy Fleming were wonderful.  Rich Little was funny without being dirty.  Last, but not least the presentation of the original Christmas story was beautiful.  Reminds me of a time when we took for granted the wonderful shows on TV and the movie screen.  Talented classy performers were the norm.  Now, pop culture is like an open sewer/garbage dump with no talent performers who exist by seeing how dirty they can be.",1387324800,14,584,4.8979591836734695

825044,5,6304285728,"This is a great DVD of  Mr C's christmas special from 1974. Hailed as one of the best by some. It puts you in the Christmas spirit reminiscing of christmases past. What is also good about this DVD is that it is shown in it's entirety.
Guest stars include The Carpenters singing a medley of Perry's songs while he sings theirs. Peggy Fleming appears, who was  1968's Olympic champion,  skating in a winter wonderland production and Rich Little who does his impersonations of the day.
Look out for the sketch with Rich Little playing Jack Benny as Santa Claus. There is a little girl who when she hears Rich Little say that he can't wait for Christmas Eve night when he will climb down the chimney and get the kids to BUY some toys. In amazement she exclaims ""buy some toys"" which cracks Perry and the audience up as she was not supposed to speak but just stand there.
Bonus material includes Richard Carpenter talking about Perry's shows which spanned from the late 1940's to the 90's. Then there is a medley of christmas songs by Perry also a rendition of ""Ave Maria"" from a 1975 springtime special. It ends with a commercial of Perry advertising for GTE and a newsreel when he met President Eisenhower.
A must for all Perry fans everywhere.",1386547200,2,1241,4.556053811659193

825177,5,6304285728,"Perry Como was still in his prime in 1974 and this full-length Christmas special is as charming of a
holiday music program as one could hope for. Perfectly old-fashioned but also still fresh with
wonderful guests The Carpenters, who, like Perry, sang some of the best Christmas music ever
that is still played and today. This is a terrific trip back to happy, simpler times that
music lovers of all ages can enjoy. Some very nice special features are included too - more songs
and a mini-documentary about Perry's decades as a TV singing star.",1386028800,,543,4.726315789473684

825180,5,6304285728,"Perry Como made Christmas shows on radio and TV from the 1940s to the early 1990s.  This one, taped at NBC Burbank and broadcast on CBS in 1974, features Mr. C., The Carpenters, Olympic figure skating champion Peggy Fleming, and Rich Little - the best impressionist ever. In this special Rich impersonates everyone from Raymond Burr to Jack Benny to Howard Cosell to Johnny Carson to Perry himself.  Peggy does two skating routines; The Carpenters perform their then-current Christmas single, ""Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town,"" and do a medley with Perry, where each sings the other's hits, including a rare solo by Richard Carpenter.  Looking at the footage, Karen Carpenter's face looked gaunt even then; perhaps she was already suffering the effects of the anorexia that would take her life a decade later.  Perry also does a few solo Christmas carols, and narrates ""The Story Of Christmas.""

Bonus features include ""Mr. C. On TV,"" a mini-doc narrated by Richard Carpenter (he has really aged); a medley of Christmas carols; Perry's 1975 performance of Schubert's ""Ave Maria,"" introduced by Richard Carpenter; a Como commercial for the show's sponsor, General Telephone & Electronics (GTE), which, years later, merged with two of the Baby Bells - Bell Atlantic and NYNEX - to form Verizon Communications; plus newsreel footage, featuring Perry and President Eisenhower, from 1959.

If you're a Como fan, you will love this.  I hope MPI Home Video makes more Como specials available, particularly ones from the 1960s and 1970s.",1385856000,2,1527,5.108433734939759

825182,5,6304285728,"I must say, this DVD of a 1974 Christmas show was spectacular. If you're a fan of the Christmas TV specials of the 1960's and 1970's, then this should be something you would like.

As great or greater as any Bing Crosby or Andy Williams Christmas special, Perry Como really brings a nice Christmas atmosphere in this show with many great songs such as ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" and ""Toyland."" The scenery in which he performs these classics and so many others is complete ""Christmas nostalgia"" in every way.

It's also a treat to have ""Perry"" sing some songs I don't think he ever sang on any of his own Christmas recordings. Here he sings the first part of ""The Christmas Waltz"" and there are also a couple of other Christmas songs I wasn't familiar with and so this was all an extra special treat.

The guests such as ""The Carpenters"" add an extra special touch.

Definite essential viewing for the Christmas season I would say. Could even put it on for some background entertainment when guests are over during the Christmas season.",1385424000,,1050,4.65945945945946
