I live in Germany and got the DVD very fast!!",1292716800,,116,3.68
4043607,4,B0030CI4FS,"First of all, i did enjoy this film and felt i got my moneys worth. That being said, Harbortown Bobber has big shoes to fill if you've already seen Choppertown and especailly Brittown, the two previous films by Scott and Zac at One World Studios. Choppertown is great, and Brittown is simply fantastic, though i do admit a bias to vintage triumphs and dirtbikes in general. This doc seems to be trying to be a ""how to"" video for the garage builder without actually getting to far into the process itself, or the ""lifestyle"" of the west coast bike scene without doing either all to completely. The balance found in Brittown just doesnt seem to be found here. I guess that would be my complaint if i had one. Overall though i think it makes a good addition on my shelf next to Choppertown and Brittown and look forward to seeing more films by these guys. Zac and Scott have done something purely through there own will and drive and i applaud them for it. Thanks, guys, your videos make getting through a hard Minnesota winter a little bit easier.",1281484800,,1045,4.505263157894737
4043608,5,B0030CI4FS,"I really loved this documentary even though I had little previous
knowledge about motorcycles and how they are built. The documentary
allows us to see a motorcycle being built from the ground up, which was
a really interesting and intense process. I got so involved in the
process that I almost felt like I was right there and I was so excited
when the product actually worked the way it was supposed to!

The guys in the film are all extremely knowledgeable and it is clear
that they all have a bond. There is no drama or competition amongst
them. Their bond is really encouraging as it gives hope that people can
still come together and work towards a goal while getting along during
the whole process. I really loved this movie and from now on I will have
more respect for motorcycles, how they were made, and those who build
and ride them!",1276473600,,843,4.474025974025974
4043609,5,B0030CI4FS,"This documentary was extremely interesting to me, even though I've never built a motorcycle on my own. It was truly amazing to see a motorcycle being built from the ground up. Scott DiLalla, one of the directors of the film, is focused on as he builds his dream bike with the help of some other riders and friends. We see the entire process of building a bike and how detailed it truly is. We also get to hear some of the riders' personal anecdotes about why they have grown to love building and riding motorcycles so much.

Whether you like to build motorcycles or not, their outlook on building and dedication to a craft is relatable to everyone. Their thoughts, feelings and ideas can be applied to just about any team-related activity. I really enjoyed the team feel that these men conveyed when they came together to work on the bike and share their past experiences. It was a really special look into the lifestyle that comes along with riding a motorcycle.",1276214400,4,963,4.598837209302325
4043610,5,B0030CI4FS,"""The Harbortown Bobber"" was a great documentary for those who already love motorcycles as well as those who do not! This doc follows Scott DiLalla as he builds his own bike, allowing other bike masters to help him out along the way. The footage allows us to see the time, effort and detail that has to go into building a bike from the bottom up. It also allows us to understand, through the bikers themselves, why it is so important to them.

The film as a whole sheds light on the building process. It really highlights how complicated and intricate motorcycles are. It was amazing to see a motorcycle being built from nothing! The best part of the film was when the finished product was tested out and it ran beautifully. I really enjoyed the fact that the guys in the film worked together towards one goal. They were not competing against each other or trying to outdo anyone else. It was a great portrait of teamwork at its best and I think that this film would be beneficial for anyone to watch - whether they ride motorcycles or not!",1276214400,3,1039,4.468421052631579
8385715,3,B0030CI4FS,"Not exactly what I was expecting.  This turned out to be a 'dirty' version of OC Choppers with little to no insight to how things were machined etc. Some of the stories they were telling between the stages of the bike, while interesting on their own right, didn't tie in well with the overall build.",1418169600,,299,4.4363636363636365
8385716,5,B0030CI4FS,great flick,1416355200,,11,5.0
8385717,2,B0030CI4FS,This was basically HALF OF A MOVIE.  The beginning was good but once they put the motor on the bike they seemed to fast-forward to the completion of the entire bike. Three out of three of us watching this movie agreed. AND (this of course is my opinion only) AND bike looked Waaaay better before they beefed it up. I was looking forward to this movie and was very disappointed.  This DVD is worth $5.00 and a free coupon for the sequel that has yet to be filmed. SAVE YOUR MONEY.,1385596800,,479,4.252747252747253
8385718,3,B0030CI4FS,"as my review title says...its no Choppertown.
Choppertown was awesome and I was expecting that greatness from this dvd as well. I would say that Choppertown was a lucky lightning strike for the creators of these movies. Nothing else ive seen from this team even comes close to Choppertown.
That being said...maybe Choppertown was so good that it is unfair to compare the rest of their movies to it?

In summary: Buy Choppertown if you havnt yet.

Then come back and buy this one if you want :)",1367107200,2,680,6.0625
8385719,4,B0030CI4FS,"I bought this for my husband who has built motorcycles since he was little and it was a hit with him. While not the best bike build documentary, definitely a good one.",1365552000,,167,4.25
8385720,3,B0030CI4FS,"First of all there are too many Harleys in this video, thought there would be a lot more Brit Iron. Secondly, I thought it would focus on the technical aspect of building this bike... it really didn't in my opinion.

 It was very entertaining, had a decent sound track and humor.",1356998400,2,279,4.450980392156863
8385721,3,B0030CI4FS,It was ok... The guy dressing up in a cape & crap seemed like some punk from one of my son's skateboard videos... Corny... but ok.,1348531200,,130,4.038461538461538
8385722,1,B0030CI4FS,"Old story.  Told hundreds of times.  Why does it seem unique just because its the first time the writers experienced building a bike?
Its like very pregnant mother needs to start a blog and discuss her childbirth.  Seriously!?  Do men have to do the same thing, just because they got their 1st chopper?

Boring.  Slow.  Same thing told on one of a 100 different shows on TV or cable.

Not worth the money to buy.

Spend the $20 and go to a local bike night.  Chat with some real people.  Get a couple beers.  Way better than buying this movie.",1345248000,,543,4.32
8385723,5,B0030CI4FS,"This 2009 film will give someone more than ""ride by"" , as it actually lets you hear more than several qualified trade-skill mechanics briefly explain their involvement in the fragmented world of metal-benders. These folks known as ""mentors"" (usually someone who applies their skills as a team member of a some process with an end result, and obviously more for love than money).

Of more, you'll meet Goodson in his casting shop and listen to his '40 knuckle list of improvements.
And Cindy, Long Beach's treasured & natural m/c historian.
You'll see the L.A. County beach cities build scene in reality - mostly from home garages in tight neighborhoods that have paved alleys.
And J-Bird who speaks pidgin (simplified English) and gets the job done.
And Earl (who takes you on a virtual kick-stand build) + paper templates, nutz & bolts - and like Cindy is a strong thread in fabric that holds it all together. No way are these people in it for the money. It is heartening to see people like yourself hammering something out to ride on.
And it seems all the knowledgeable people in this film are over 50.
It will get you stoked.",1307318400,2,1128,4.696969696969697
8385724,5,B0030CI4FS,"Great video for guys who like to tool around with old bikes; if this is something that interests you, it's highly recommended. It can even be a bit motivational if you happen to have a project bike in your garage. I also enjoyed the fact that all of the action is set nearby where I live, they often show the same cranes and harbor that hovers in the background here which does make the film more enjoyable than those set in Arizona or on the East Coast. So, is you are a So Cal vintage bike fan, you really should buy this video!",1298246400,,530,4.155339805825243
