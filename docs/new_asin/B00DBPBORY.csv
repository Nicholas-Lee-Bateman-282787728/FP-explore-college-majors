5787453,4,B00DBPBORY,"These guys crack me up! I saw this last year when it premiered on the Hallmark Channel. I have enjoyed the Hoops & Yoyo website for several years and was so excited when Hallmark started making animated specials. I have the Christmas one also, which is also good, but Haunted Halloween is my favorite. :D
Do not, I repeat, do not get in the car with Hoops. Ever. ;)
The dvd has a handful of special features, some of which I have seen on the Hallmark website. My favorite clip is the one where Hoops and Yoyo are trick or treating and visit a haunted house. Too funny!",1382313600,,568,4.268518518518518
5787454,2,B00DBPBORY,This movie was pretty darn scvary!!! We expected it to be spooky... but a little too much for young children....,1381622400,,112,4.65
5787455,5,B00DBPBORY,"A good time can be had for all with some popcorn and hoops and yoyo.  A halloween adventure full of suspense, spooks, and laughs for all ages.",1381190400,,142,4.2592592592592595
5787456,5,B00DBPBORY,My kids and I watched this last year on the Hallmark Channel and loved it!  So happy to see its available now to own.  We love Hoops & Yoyo and this had us cracking up so much.  A lot of funny little parts to it.  We also saw the Christmas special but this one was so much better!,1380844800,,280,3.7758620689655173

8591393,5,B00DBPBORY,I laughed out loud at the Screaming Banshee clips. A must have for any video library.,1479254400,,85,4.375
8591394,5,B00DBPBORY,"A few years ago I ran across this cute and funny Halloween show on the Hallmark Channel, featuring the always entertaining Hoops and Yoyo! My kids and myself just loved it, and recorded it to our DVR. It actually stayed on our DVR for about 3 years, until I decided I should probably get a hard copy in case we were to lose it. It follows Hoops and Yoyo on their quest to get Halloween costumes, as they have waited until the last possible minute to shop. I'm so glad to have found a copy of this, as it will be playing at our house every October to come!",1452297600,,555,4.10091743119266
8591395,4,B00DBPBORY,"Fun cute movie, my daughter loves it.",1447891200,,37,4.428571428571429
8591396,5,B00DBPBORY,"While I have not seen this particular special, I want to say that Hoops and Yoyo are an adorable pair. I have watched many of their short cartoons and I absolutely love them. I sometimes kind of wish they had something going for them on TV like Garfield or Peanuts do. Heck, they could actually make a really cute newspaper comic, too. They are very entertaining characters for just about anyone to watch at least for five minutes at a time and the Hallmark audio cards they are featured in are some of the cutest, most clever ones I've seen in a long time. I would even venture so far as to say that if worked with in the right directions, the material they have to work with could even be better than some of today's TV series cartoons.",1430006400,,738,4.316546762589928
8591397,5,B00DBPBORY,hilarious!,1425340800,,10,10.0
8591398,5,B00DBPBORY,This is a funny video.  Good for kids 6+. Not too scary.  Watch the bonus clips. The screaming banshee is hilarious.,1415232000,,116,4.476190476190476
8591399,2,B00DBPBORY,"I was very disappointed by this movie.  I had seen the Christmas episode last year and my 3 year old loved it.  I bought this and we've watched it once.  There are a couple moments that had him laughing, but I'll say this:  He hasn't asked to watch it again.  I think that when a kid does not want to watch something again it simply isn't that good.  On this one, they've missed the mark, and it's too bad because the first one was so good.",1414022400,2,440,4.058139534883721
8591400,5,B00DBPBORY,My nephew absolutely loved this! He watches it over & over & over! One of the best investments I ever made!,1388966400,,107,4.142857142857143
8591401,5,B00DBPBORY,"This was a cute, kid friendly Halloween cartoon. It held their interest and they all loved the movie and enjoyed watching it. I'm so glad  Amazon had this for sale. Thanks amazon :)",1388448000,2,181,4.484848484848484
