Professor Brier is so knowledgeable (and funny too). I really enjoyed all of the stories he told as well. He explains the Hieroglyphs in a very clear manner and really encourages his students' progress.",1503446400,,343,4.639344262295082

7800597,5,1629973300,"Knowing Ancient Greek and Latin very well, I had always wanted to learn something about Egyptian hieroglyphs, but found the Egyptian grammars off-putting, mostly because of the complexity of the myriad of similar-looking hieroglyphs and the thought of having to read and draw them.  I found Professor Breier's ""Decoding the Secrets of Egyptian Hieroglyphs"" to be an unexpectedly-easy introduction to all the basic principles.  As an teacher myself, I was impressed by the way the course was organized to give a surprisingly-comprehensive introduction to the Egyptian language in 24 30-minute lessons.

This course makes starting in hieroglyphs easy, with several clearly-explained examples of each grammatical principle introduced and then reviewed in carefully-chosen exercises.  This course is a perfect comprehensive overview before one tackles a more extensive Egyptian grammar.

This course is divided into 24 easily-learnable units, balanced by history related to hieroglyphs, their decipherment, and pertinent Egyptian history interspersed.  It is amazing how fast and easily one learns in this course.  Each lesson also has hieroglyph-to-English and English-to-hieroglyph homework, which is gone over in detail at the beginning of the succeeding lesson.  The homework sentences are well formulated to cement the grammar and vocabulary of the lesson.

The detailed story of the decipherment of hieroglyphs interspersed with the initial lessons was well presented and finally understandable to me after I had heard over the years several partial versions.  After Lecture 7, the history of the decipherment shifted focus to fascinating elements of Egyptian history related to hieroglyphs.

The explanation of how to draw each uniliteral hieroglyph was excellent.  This practical matter is not covered in the standard Ancient Egyptian grammars (Gardiner, Allen, etc.).

The Course Guidebook is eminently useful.  I would ask in additional only for a Uniliteral (Alphabet) appendix table, listing the hieroglyph, what it represents (e.g., vulture), its transliteration (e.g., ""a""), and its pronunciation.  The biliteral and triliteral appendix should have the same information in the tables provided.  In the Guidebook this information is not gathered together in one appendix table, but included only in the lessons.

A quibble.  The references to the purported racism and morals of the great Victorian scholars of Ancient Egypt were inappropriate and should have been redacted.",1496016000,6,2482,5.771978021978022

7800599,5,1629973300,"I own a previous course taught by Bob Brier, ""The History of Ancient Egypt"", and when I saw that this one was published and is also taught by him, I snatched up a copy.  And of course it's great.

Bob Brier has a very engaging personality and a sincere, youthful love of his subject of Ancient Egypt that really holds your attention, and his knowledge is extreme in the extreme.  His ability to draw?  Well, let's just say he's not exactly Norman Rockwell -- but at least he always shows you what the actual hieroglyphs are supposed to look like, alongside his drawing them himself.

I've loved the aesthetic and mythology of Ancient Egypt ever since I was a little kid, and this video brings me right back to my youthful spirit.  If you pick up a copy, not only will you enjoy it yourself, but you can buy copies as a great present for that quirky son or daughter, niece or nephew, grandson or granddaughter who loves to draw and always has their nose in an encyclopedia or history book.",1478649600,5,988,4.430939226519337
