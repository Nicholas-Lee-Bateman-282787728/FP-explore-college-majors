8588336,2,B000LE872S,"I found this DVD disappointing.  Listed as 60 minutes, it is actually barely 45 minutes in length, with very odd 'breaks' as if for insertion of commercials when used by a PBS.  Also the reference to the ""Great Barrier Reef"" is totally erroneous.  I ignored the misnomer on the promo text and label packaging as marketing ignorance, but was appalled by that verbal misuse, not once but three times, by a primary documentary host.  The Belize Barrier Reef is just that. As an educator, I am unable to use this DVD for that reason.  Depictions of the island residents, their lifestyles, and accomodations are realistic.  The segment on punta dancing is good but minimal, not quite enough for me to overlook the other discrepancies.",1205107200,,729,4.838709677419355
