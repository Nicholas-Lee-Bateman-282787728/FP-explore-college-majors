It was made around 1998, and that shows in the production values. For the first few minutes, I was afraid the whole video would be simply a classroom lecture by a slightly odd teacher (dressed in an archaeologist costume!) There were SOME on location shots of historic sites and artifacts, so it was better than my initial impression. Very little is re-enacted, which I'm actually happy about.

A more recent ""Discovery Channel"" video will probably be more slick and fancy than this video series. On the other hand, this is designed for children, so there is no risk of some kind of ""racy"" adult information about an ancient culture popping up... (I'm willing to deal with radical departures from our personal morals when explaining history, but not all parents will want to explain Egyptian royal incest, etc.)

This video covers the possibility that an inland lake on modern Santorini is the actual site of the lost continent of Atlantis, the Minoan civilization, and the Mycenaen civilization. I have been reading about a dozen elementary level books on these topics in the past couple of weeks, and there were no obvious errors on the video that I caught. That's actually a pretty good track record from what I've found elsewhere. I wouldn't spend my money to purchase this unless I were a teacher returning to it year after year, but it was well worth watching for our home school use.",1381190400,,1572,4.750915750915751
