I pull my blu-rays out anytime I'm having a rough day, and slowly shuffle through, trying to decide which bad guy hassling John McClane will perk me up the most.  Will it be Hans Gruber?  Thomas Gabriel?  Colonel Stuart?  Or should I choose by sidekick?  Or featured offspring?  Or best barefoot stunt?  Doesn't matter, there's four wonderful movies to pick from.  And the last one.

7359521,3,B012Z2NO58,"I'll skip my thoughts on the series because if you haven't seen the films by now, there's no hope for you. As for the set itself, my initial thought is that it is pretty nice,  if not a tad impractical for displaying purposes. My motivating factor to make the purchase was the inclusion of the unrated version of the fourth film. Saying that, I would have been just as satisfied with a standard box set with new remaster. But the movies themselves are great (the first 4) and should be enjoyed in all of its HD glory.",1489449600,2,517,4.329896907216495

This collection also comes with mini lithograph cards of each villain with stats about them on the reverse sides. It also comes with a mini behind-the-scenes booklet, which nicely compliments the bonus Decoding Die Hard disc that is included.

Everything listed fits into a cardboard sleeve which can be hidden in the base on the backside of the model. The model itself is a wonderful display peace! So incredible, and worth every penny!!!",1481414400,4,641,4.663716814159292
7359531,5,B012Z2NO58,"Die Hard was a movie i saw by accident a very long time ago because some friends I was with watched it.  I probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I've grown as a fan of the story of John McClain over the years and this seems like a great way to get all the Bluray discs at one time (I was replacing Laserdiscs) and the Nakatomi tower is a great way to display it.

Everything arrived in great shape but was a little surprised there was just one Bluray case in the base, but all the discs are cleverly packaged into that single case.  I haven't had a chance to watch the movies yet, but I was really more worried that the tower would be damaged in shipping as others had mentioned, but that wasn't the case.

This is my favorite Christmas movie (1 and 2) and Lethal Weapon.",1480809600,2,808,4.220779220779221

I've been a collector of Die Hard paraphernalia since I was a kid. Die Hard was the first R rated movie I ever saw. I have multiple collectors editions of the movies, and many ""Set""'s like this. This is my favorite one by far. Everything is very well organized inside the package and the Tower looks amazing.

If you want a Die Hard set and have the money to spend to buy something of this caliber, I fully support purchasing this set. It's amazing.",1476144000,2,489,4.247311827956989

7359540,5,B012Z2NO58,"This Nakatomi Plaza Collection includes the unrated director's cut of Live Free or Die Hard. Anyone who hated the theatrical edition should watch this version before judging. John McClane's catchphrase in no longer censored. He uses that word PG13 hated a lot more than once. Im not sure why the studio wanted the theatrical cut to be PG13. If kids couldn't watch the first three, why would they watch the fourth film? The first one I saw was Die Hard 2, and I was confused every time a reference to the previous film came up. I never even saw the theatrical cut of Live Free or Die Hard, knowing our heros catchphrase would be censored, I waited for the directors cut. The first film came out in 1988, but its set during Christmas 1989. Die Hard 2 says its the 1990's. Die Hard 2 came out in 1990. John McClane of Die Hard 2 says this is how he spent Christmas last year. One year after 1988 wouldnt be the 1990's. A Good Day To Die Hard has an extended edition that omits Lucy McClane, not sure why, I like Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Sky High, Grindhouse). A lot of people seem to hate the last two films, even when going by the director's cut of the fKurth film. A lot of people hated The X-Files season ten. Oh I get it, they don't like seeing their heroes grow old. Theres also a bonus disc called decoding die hard. The boxset comes in a huge model of the Nakatomi Plaza, which is why they call this the Nakatomi Plaza Collection.",1466035200,2,1434,4.33457249070632

However, the case for the discs is too loose and often the Blu-Ray case will slide out at the slightest movement.

My only wish is that one floor would light up where the party is taking place, and a few other floors would flash intermittently, like gunfire, where some of the action scenes are taking place. I love the movie collection for Alien for that reason. There is a switch to turn on a small light that glows within the model alien egg.  Spooky.",1453248000,,437,4.602564102564102

7359574,5,B012Z2NO58,"If you're a fan of the Die Hard franchise who is looking for a convenient way to upgrade your old DVDs and get the full high-definition treatment for the franchise, this is definitely a great set!  With all five movies and a very decent selection of special features, in addition to a very nifty display-model of the Nakatomi Tower that houses the discs, Id highly recommend it.

just try and get it on sale.  While the Nakatomi Tower model is a great conversation and display-piece and a very cool container for the films, I don't think its inclusion warrants the $100 (or more) price tag.  This is a great set  just not quite $100 great if you catch my drift.  I could definitely see dropping $75-$80 on it, but going into triple-digits for the price tag is a bit much.  Its essentially a foot-or-so-tall piece of thin hollow plastic, and to be honest, its not even particularly sturdy or heavy.  Im almost 100% sure at some point my copy is going to pick up scuffs or chips just from basic use and transportation no matter how careful I am, so be aware that this isn't an overly-intricate or expensive model.  Its just sort-of a fun-albeit-flimsy display-piece.  (I managed to pick it up on Sale the day after Christmas for about $65, and for that price, its a steal!  So keep your eyes peeled on other possible sales.)

The video quality is fantastic.  Especially the original film.  This is easily the best Ive ever seen it look in a home-video release.  All of the sequels look fantastic and quite sharp and crisp.

Im also very pleased by the inclusion of the Unrated Cut of the fourth film, which was a big selling point for me and pushed me into finally taking the dive to buying this film.  I never hated the original PG-13 cut, but the Unrated Cut I had seen on DVD was a much more tonally and aesthetically sound version when placed into the perspective of the series, and Ive had trouble finding Blu-Ray copies of it in the past, so knowing it was definitely part of this release very much pleased me.

Id say if you're interested, this set will probably please you.  And I do highly recommend it.  I just do think its worth holding off until you can get it at a good sale price before picking it up.",1452211200,4,2213,4.444168734491315
7359575,5,B012Z2NO58,"This is the most unnecessary awesome thing I have ever found! I bought as a gift for my boyfriend and even though he doesn't need it , he and I both can't help but love it.

The original Die Hard is a classic in every sense of the word. It may be the best action-comedy ever made, with great laughs and suspense all the way through. The sequels... are of varying quality. For my money, Die Hard with a Vengeance is the only one that comes close to the original's greatness, but they all have their moments. That said, this review is not about the films but this specific collector's edition.

This set is packaged very nicely inside a box with a large window on the front and a variety of pictures from the films on the other sides. The model of the building is fantastic. It stands tall (somewhere around 16"" I believe) and is very impressive. It also comes with the films (of course!), a slip for digital copies of the films, and some cards featuring the villains (that are bigger than I expected but still not all that big).

Personally, I really appreciate that they put the discs inside of a case. Sometimes these sets come with the movies in sleeves or, worse, simply loose, held in place by a spindle or foam. I have a shelf with all of my movies and this means I can put the case containing the movies while still having the Nakatomi Plaza model elsewhere to admire.

All in all, it's a fantastic set and a great purchase for any true fan.",1451433600,2,1890,5.207236842105263

7359589,5,B012Z2NO58,"Haven't gotten it yet but I'm certain that all of these fans can't be wrong. Just ordered it and greatly anticipate its arrival. I'm even more chuffed because the price is aces! So glad to finally get DIE HARD 4.0 In its uncut form. Looks like I can finally dump the DVD of it along with the first  DIE HARD BLURAY COLLECTION.

UPDATE: It finally arrived! Such a beautiful model. The discs are great as are the villain cards and Behind The Scenes booklet. Not sure if the first three were remastered but they look and sound great. Their menus appear to be the same.  I didn't have any issues with the transfers previously so all of the negative flap about it was completely lost on me.",1449100800,,685,4.377952755905512
7359590,3,B012Z2NO58,"My rating on this item has more to do with the double dip aspect than the movies themselves.  The movies are awesome (if I was just rating the movies I would have given it a 5 star rating), but I already had the original blu-ray collection of these movies.  Unfortunately the people at Fox want people to keep having to buy these movies (even though the Live Free Die Hard movie was already available in the unrated version on DVD they didn't put the unrated version in ANY bluray set until this one).  Expensive double dip here in order to get the unrated version, had to purchase this ""Collector's Piece"" to get it.  Nakatomi Plaza will be sitting in the attic collecting dust along with a few of the other Fox Collector's editions that were the only sets to include special items (namely planet of the apes bust - to which was the only way to get planet of the apes tv series at the time).  These items for a collector can be nice additions to a collection but for a person who just wants the movies, this was a bit of overkill.  When a company does this, they should put out a separate set that will include only the movies.  I didn't need or want a stupid building to show off.  I just wanted to be able to replace my previous DVD of the one movie.

To sum up, if you do not have any of the previous versions and/or want the most complete Bluray set of the Die Hard movies then this is the set for you.  However if you already have a previous version and don't care about having the unrated version of Die Hard 4, then I would go with an earlier set.",1449100800,9,1555,4.205387205387205
7359591,5,B012Z2NO58,"When I opened the box and saw the building, I got the biggest smile on my face. It's just a hunk of useless plastic but I love it. I'm very happy I waited to buy the original movies on Blu so I could do the awesome upcharge for this collection.",1448928000,2,244,3.9
7359592,5,B012Z2NO58,"I have to say, I was excited when i seen this, but not the price.  I have all the dvds (1-4)/and bluray of the 5th, and never got any of them (1-4) on bluray because ""Live Free.."" wasn't available with unrated.  This set definitely is, which has been stated in another comment, which helped me buy this.  I LOVE Die Hard, all of them, though in my opinion the 5th doesn't feel like a die hard film.  Anyways...  The building isn't made of some cheap plastic, it's pretty sturdy, if it had been cheap i would be sending it back.  The Villian cards and the info booklet it pretty awesome.  The Discs are in a standard 6 disc case, not some shotty cardboard thing, like the indiana jones collection.  And someone had stated that the uv code was only'd good for Vudu, that is wrong, or at least now it is, I check and it's good for flixster or vudu.  Which ever your preference be.  I'm glad i got this, as i never get anything cool like this, i always talk my self out of it.  Super glad i didn't on this.",1448928000,3,1002,4.166666666666667

7359594,5,B012Z2NO58,"""Yippie Kay Yah....This Set is freakin' AWESOME.!!!!"" Is literally what I said when I opened the box today.
This Nakatomi collector's set is fantastic!
UPDATE: 7/5/16....(Look at my updated photo of the real Nakatomi Plaza as it stands as of last week here in Century City in Los Angeles, California. Thought  you all might enjoy seeing the real deal. Its just a mile from my apartment in LA.)

Made of strong hard plastic. The Blu Rays are tucked in the back of the base behind a mini flap and housed in one blu ray case with several snap in disc holders not in paper sleeves like a lot of collector's sets do. Each movie is on a separate disc plus a bonus disc with special features. In it is the Digital Copy code. The Blu ray case is also housed in a cardboard slipcover which includes a mini movie booklet & villain profile cards.

The Digital Copies for all movies is on a paper with just one code for Ultraviolet only not iTunes. I used it on VUDU and searched for NAKATOMI COLLECTION then entered the one code and all 5 movies are automatically redeemed. Its comes up in a bundle on VUDU.

Great high definition. I think they remastered this to blu ray unlike other blu ray copies in the past. I bought the Die Hard blu ray 4 years ago but it didn't seem remastered. It played like a DVD quality and was very disappointed so I never bought the other movies on blu ray.  I thought these blu rays with  the Nakatomi set would be the same but I bought it anyway because I wanted the collectible building but to my surprise the blu rays are better quality picture than the previous blu ray of Die Hard I bought a few years ago. Now watching this Nakatomi Die Hard blu ray it seems much clearer picture. Very happy with the quality picture.

As I am watching the movie now, I see in the film (see my photos) Hans Gruber is admiring a model of Nakatomi Plaza in the board room just like this one so that makes this even cooler to own. I had forgotten about that scene. This one is a little smaller than the one in the movie but a great likeness. See below the photos of this item which I bought at Fox Connect not here on Amazon because Amazon did not state whether it had the Digital Copies or not. Fox Connect did state the Digital Copies were included so I bought mine on that site.

My one decision is to display it in the cool box as in my pictures posted or display it out of the box were you can really see the building. I am now in search of a tiny police car to put at the base of the building as Sgt. Powell's car. I think that would be a hoot!... haha

 On a side note I live 2 miles from the actual Nakatomi Plaza building on Ave Of The Stars in Century City, now called Fox Plaza. I still after 20 years of living in Los Angeles, still get a kick out of driving by Nakatomi Plaza.

Very happy with my purchase. If you are a Die Hard fan you must own this collector's set.

PS. Amazon rotated my upright photos I loaded up. Nothing I can do to fix them sorry.",1447459200,104,2973,4.160278745644599

7359599,1,B012Z2NO58,"I already have the first 3 Die Hard movies on Blu-Ray (didn't like the 4th or 5th movie much) but I got this special collection for two reasons.

1) The Nakatomi Plaza building - which turns out to be a plastic piece of junk.  A slight tap will probably break it.

2) Getting the movies in Digital HD - however, THE MOVIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON FLIXSTER ULTRAVIOLET yet (hopefully, they will be soon).  I've contacted Fox Digital HD Support and Flixster Customer Care for UltraViolet but haven't recieved a response so far.

If you already have whatever Die Hard movies you like on DVD, don't bother getting this.",1444867200,6,612,4.577981651376147
7359600,5,B012Z2NO58,"Great set! I'm somewhat of a newcomer to the Die Hard series, I've seen 4 of 5 movies before buying this collection but I've never owned them. The centerpiece of the collection, the Nakatomi Plaza replica, it's awesome. It's bigger than I was expecting, about 1 foot and 4 inches tall, made of pretty hearty plastic too. All 6 discs, the behind the scenes booklet, and the villain cards are contained in a box that fits into a compartment at the base of the replica.

Sadly, this is a limited edition collection and I do believe Amazon has sold out of their stock. The collection is most likely still avaloble at other outlets at a somewhat cheaper price, such as Fox's online merch store.",1444780800,9,689,4.556451612903226

8726802,5,B012Z2NO58,"Those are the words I uttered to a friend of mine when he told me I should go see Bruce Willis in Die Hard and I was shocked when the movie was over and realized that THIS was not the Bruce Willis I saw on Moonlighting and I realized this could be the start of a great thing....and I was right.....then came Die Hard 2:Die Harder....Great movie as well......Then it was up to Manhattan with a vengeance, plenty of action, was it a Nakatomi Plaza scenario?.....NO but worth the watch anyway......Then we're back to D.C. And Live free and Die Hard where we enter the Computer Technology Age and Timothy Olyphant plays a crafty Techno Wizard who send the D.C. Internet grid into chaos while looking for and eliminating all the top computer hackers in the country to keep from being stopped.......except one, who John McClain is assigned to protect and bring into the FBI Office......
This one is one of my favorite Die Hard Movies next to the first two and lastly, we have A Good Day To Die Hard, where John McClain travels to Russia to deal with some bad guys and runs into an unexpected as well as an unwelcomed surprise, his estranged son, who is working the same case and it takes some time for the two to agree to work together without killing each other..
It's an okay film but definitely not one of my favorites but is brimming with that Die Hard Action you're used to.
All of this being said, I already own the entire Die Hard franchise so spending nearly $100 bucks, realistically, just for the replica of Nakatomi Plaza does me no good, I don't have the space for it right now......",1531094400,,1589,4.463917525773196
