8512518,2,B00792H8IY,"This blu-ray is NOT the ""presentation of Professor Iain Stewart"". He is in it briefly, but it is not the version narrated by Stewart. The version narrated by Stewart is far superior to this one. This is an OK documentary, but Stewart's version would get 5 stars and is the one I wanted. Very disappointed in this blu-ray.",1515024000,,321,4.551724137931035

When I received it I realized it had been misrepsented.,  It is not in english with spanish subtitles.  It is in spanish with spanish subtitles.  I tried to fix the problem by using enlish subtitles.  But there were no subtitles availablle.  If you do receive ""Human Instinct"" in English I would be very pleased if you would notify me.  Thank you for your consideration on this matter.  Miriam Steinfield",1356998400,,483,4.588235294117647
