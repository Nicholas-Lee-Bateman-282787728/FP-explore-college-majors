Reading, beginning math (subtraction, addition.), music, art, dance/exercise, even Knock Knock jokes (we all need a break from the studies!)... My favorite is the ""pets"" song...

I am especially happy with the review time at the end of the show! ! It flows so quickly from one subject to the next I need the review. My child seems to remember everything on the review more so than I do...

Does it get any better than this?

hmmmm..... I know!! Maybe, buy TWO JibberBoosh DVDs, Shapes along with this counting one? LOL  If there are anymore JibberBoosh shows out there, I would love to add it to my collection (of Two...)...",1281398400,,881,4.701298701298701
