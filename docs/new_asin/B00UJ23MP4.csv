I now own both and see no reason to have both and, between the two, Live at Royal Albert Hall is much better in all respects.",1526428800,,326,4.190476190476191

8707058,5,B00UJ23MP4,"This was a great dvd because it was Adele.

What really impressed me is the way it was produced. It really felt close-up and like she was in a small venue. Very different than the ""live at Albert Hall"" dvd which I also really like.",1494028800,,231,4.133333333333334
