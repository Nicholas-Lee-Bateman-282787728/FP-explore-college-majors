7899039,5,6305994137,"This is my favorite DVD about a solo instrumental performer.  the DVD autobiography of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, narrated in two other languages besides German, by his truly, would be the version about a singer.  ""The Golden Ring"", the story of Decca's recording of ""Gotterdammerung"" in 1964 is my favorite ""overall"" DVD - performance, orchestra, cast and conductor AND audio producer all being the subject.  From the day I saw ""The Golden Ring"" on PBS after coming home from high school when I was 17, that program became the catalyst for my career first as a professional singer and then as a record producer myself.
THIS Menuhin DVD seems the most ""human"" of all these great documentaries.  He was an astonishing human being who does not strike me as ever having wanted to be Jascha Heifetz, as another reviewer implies in a poorly reasoned review.
Menuhin seems a fine human being first of all.  I cannot say this about a large number of solo performers be they instrumental or vocal or conductors.  I've been dealing with 'artists' my whole adult life.  A few always deliver the goods and are equally positive when the topic is others.  For many, the time required to rise in such a competitive profession ultimately leaves them empty at their core.  This is so sad.  I knew one very famous singer who withdrew further and further into their own odd world as they became more famous.  We started out as colleagues on stage.  My last sighting of this person was their staring me down at a gala concert with a contemptuous look coupled with utter silence.
The point of the story is Menuhin is a mench; and he's so incredibly bright.  The thought that he would behave as a diva or divo if you must, seems preposterous.  This warmth can't be said ascribed to a lot of performers who achieve world fame - forget thta Menuhin did so as a boy!
When I get a bit down I watch a few minutes of this DVD.  Its a real pick-me-up!
I purchased it here for about 35 dollars.  I had to laugh when I saw one dealer wanted over $400 for it USED!  Don't give into the scalpers. Wait 'til you can get a copy under $50 if that's still possible.  These prices shift DURING the day - so check often and don't over spend.  You'll be SO glad you did!",1400716800,,2230,4.502487562189055
7899040,5,6305994137,"If you are interested in Yehudi Menuhin or great violinists, I think you will enjoy ""Yehudi Menuhin: Violin of the Century"".

It is pretty substantial, some two hours. There are lots of archival photos and even some videos from his childhood. Apparently, Menuhin spent almost all of his childhood practicing violin. Most of the DVD is Menuhin talking or playing music, which is really great. The musical excerpts are very good. Personally, Menuhin is not my favorite, I find his tone sometimes harsh. I think his technique was so incredibly good that sometimes the musical message got lost in all the notes. However, some of the recorded performances on the DVD are incredibly beautiful. Menuhin was certainly one of the greatest. In any case, the DVD lets you listen to his playing and form your own opinion.

Yehudi Menuhin was not a ""one-dimensional"" musician. He did many things musically and in his personal life: Menuhin with his second wife, apparently a happy marriage. Menuhin doing yoga (he seems very good). Menuhin playing music with Ravi Shankar.

There is little or no filler in this DVD. Menuhin seems pretty honest about his violin playing and his life, which he talks about a lot. Menuhin is accompanied in parts of the DVD by his sister Hephzibah, a masterful pianist.",1392595200,,1286,4.917050691244239
7899041,5,6305994137,"Is Menuhin the most polarizing violinist of 20th century? I could understand why some people find it hard to enjoy his playing, but still I was astonished to have read Michael's hostile commentary (Michael ""Strings Researcher""). There is no denial that Menuhin's technical mastery had become increasingly shaky in his maturity, which inevitably interfered with his interpretation. But his musical sensitivity remained potent; his tone, to my ears at least, was forever golden and full of color. His personality, though at times seemed naive, was entirely pure, free of the ill thoughts and the grudges against other violinists that Michael and V. Stasov have imagined.

There are many riches in his recorded legacy: among them I particularly love his second mono cycle of Bach's sonatas and partitas from mid 1950s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/J-S-Bach-Sonates-Partitas/dp/B00006486Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">J.S. Bach: Sonates & Partitas</a>), for who else could have played (or even dare to play) these pieces with such fire, virility and grand Romantic gesture? His Bartok is legendary (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bartok-Violin-Concertos-Viola-Concerto-6-Duo-for-2-Violins-Violin-Rhapsodies-Yehudi-Menuhin/dp/B0000CE7FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bartok: Violin Concertos, Viola Concerto, 6 Duo for 2 Violins, Violin Rhapsodies; Yehudi Menuhin</a>). The viola concerto from the 1960s with Antal Dorati and New Philharmonic Orchestra is singularly soulful and penetrating, surpassing the readings of many a viola virtuoso. Menuhin also conducts with distinction. His Beethoven symphonies (recorded with Sinfonia Varsovia;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beethoven-The-Symphonies-Box-Set/dp/B0000AKUAL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beethoven: The Symphonies (Box Set)</a>) really bring out the humanity of this music, a feat lost to even a number of big names in the podium. It is true that Menuhin had bad days as a violinist. I am sure that he must had realized how embarrassing it was to play before public with failing standards. But I guess he had just the sort of American optimism and confidence which carried him through all this misfortune and hardship. He was, despite everything, tough, persistent and loving.

Menuhin the violinist was unfortunately flawed, but his music was nonetheless beautiful, true and moving. He was a unique, uncompromising artist, a great musician, revered by no other than the likes of Paul Tortelier, Glenn Gould and David Oistrakh himself.

===========
This documentary lovingly produced by Bruno Monsaingeon focused on Menuhin's career as a violinist. As already mentioned by other reviewers here, it did not directly address the technical/artistic crisis that Menuhin had suffered and survived. In the film, one learns about the artist's personal life and gets to hear (and watch) him playing along many great musical personalities (all very brief though), including Wilhelm Furtwangler, Ferenc Fricsay, Glenn Gould and Menuhin's sister Hephzibah, an underappreciated pianist. The program concluded with Menuhin's blazing rendition of Bach's chaconne.",1315785600,,3221,6.434180138568129
7899042,5,6305994137,"I know that many fans of the violin will be put off by the subtitle, ""The violin of the century"". There were more than a handful of great violinists in the previous century. I will not give a list. I think that there is little question that Menuhin was an excellent musician. As evidenced by the clips there is no question that Menuhin was capable of some incredible music making. However,it would have been nice to have had more insight from him about his struggles with intonation and technique as he aged. The video is a fascinating look at the recollection and the memories of a fabulous musician.",1308700800,,601,4.574074074074074
7899043,5,6305994137,"Very good sound and remarkable performance. You can see what a great personality was Menuhin. Very interesting the history of music and country. All my friends came to me to watch this film. And everybody liked it. However, after this film I cannot listen some other violinists at Davies Hall. Nobody can be compared with Menuhin.  it is really is voice of the century.

7899044,5,6305994137,Yehudi Menuhin is One of the great masters of the violin. This DVD gives you aural and visual insights into the individual and collective factors of his total persona.,1285718400,,167,4.793103448275862
7899045,5,6305994137,"I don't know much about Yehudi Menuhin, other than what's presented on this DVD; but even if it were all fantasy, the DVD is supremely inspiring. We have a storybook tale of how hard work (and innate talent) can pay off, told, mostly, by the eloquent man, himself, in his 80s. He is wonderfully expressive, emotional, intellectual, and has obviously spent many, many an hour analyzing music, his own life, and the lives of people around him, allowing him to give us provocative insights that may even relate to our own lives (mine, anyway). Whether or not it's an accurate portrait of the man, I have no idea. But I find myself watching this beautifully done film over and over, for the excitement of the presentation, the gorgeous music, and, I must add, because it makes me feel good.",1239062400,,786,4.661870503597123
7899046,2,6305994137,"If one looks at and listens carefully to this DVD and picks up the subliminal subtexts, one recognizes Menuhin for the ultimate wannabe that he was. A great child prodigy, his powers started to wane when he reached 16 years of age. Having fled from the USA to the UK and Switzerland to get away from the Heifetz phenomenon, Menuhin's seething under-he-surface rage and envy toward Heifetz resulted in an unseemly yet utterly revealing outburst on the DVD. As Menuhin played worse and worse - slow, out of tempo, unmusically, unimaginatively, with an ugly tone and out of tune - he began to label his playing as ""spiritual"". Its seems that the more spiritual his playing became in his head, the worse it sounded to his listeners! Menuhin became the big dabbler, the big wannabe. He wanted to be like the gypsies, like a Grappelli, an Enescu, a Shankar, a Kreisler, an Oistrakh, a guru, a yogi, a statesman, a philosopher, an educator, a conductor. He did become a random endorser of poor products and mediocre violinists, and the subject of numerous self-serving (auto-)biographies. All were failures that led to nothing, zero. He just became a totally self-absorbed, intolerably opiniated old man. He left a huge legacy of CD's and DVD's, most of which are unbearably bad and unlistenable, with a few very notable exceptions that painfully remind us of what could have been. No-one refers to him any more. He is forgotten, spiritually dead. An  altogether sad story.",1160438400,,1466,4.887550200803213
7899047,5,6305994137,"When I saw that Bruno Monsaingeon had made this film, I took the risk and bought it off the shelf.  Monsaingeon, who also made the excellent, Art of Violin film, has put the same kind of deep appreciation into this Menuhin work and, for that, I was not disappointed.  The film is crafted into what the sleeve calls ""... the form of a souvenir album, and it would be as if Menuhin himself was leafing through it for us, chapter by chapter"".  In fact, the documentary presents dozens of photos as it carries the story of his life forward along with approximately 40 different interludes of archival footage from 1932 on up through 1988.  Interspersed is Menuhin himself talking to an off-camera interviewer discussing his life as a prodigy, musical development, family relationships, etc.  Very candid and personal.  Each archive clip runs about a few minutes apiece and includes solo work, sonata pieces with Hephzibah, concertos with Dorati, etc.  A wide range from Schubert, Brahms, etc. to Bartok, Elgar, etc. on even to his work with Ravi Shankar and Stephane Grappelli.  I was a little disappointed however in just a few things:  1>  He didn't really discuss how he worked to overcome his technical difficulties he experienced in his later years 2> The ""East meets West"" footage with Ravi Shankar was rather murky 3> I would have enjoyed seeing a few other violinists (ala Art of the Violin) discussing Menuhin's life/work as well.  Perhaps we can't always have it all, but this 129 minute DVD did deliver some real decent goods for 20-something bucks.",1147046400,,1556,4.856060606060606
7899048,5,6305994137,"A very good documentary indeed.
Menuhin does not only tell you in person about his own pilgrimage into the holy land of music right from his birth: his early routine training, his first schoolday, his first violin teacher, his debut, his success, his experience with the gypsies, jazz, folk music including the Indians everything, ( we have various clips showing how he mixed with them sharing their experience);  and he also offers his highly remarkable views on contemporary musicians like Ysaye, Enescu, Adolf Busch, Bartok, Bruno Walter, Horowitz, Kempff, Glenn Gould, Fischer Dieskau, Furtwangler,  Fricsay,  Karajan... etc., he also very briefly tells you about his views on politics, his feelings for human sufferings and for the poor, and that he is against the provinciality of music;  he even tells you about his personal regrets...
No, we don't have a whole concerto here. Instead, we have a dozen or so of short pieces, all sparkling jems, collectors's envy: they are all heart felt music of the highest order, and the sound and photography of them are all as good as one could expect! When he is not accompanied by an orchestra, he is  mostly accompanied by Baller or else his sister, a most wonderful pianist.  When we come to certain hallmarks of his development where footage is unavailable, we have more recent footage as replacement-- doesn't really matter, for he always sounds the same!
There is also one clip when Menuhin tells us how we could relax the muscle of our left hand with some sort of a demonstration for better vibratos...
This DVD is quite long: over 2 hours, quite enough to cover everything that the audience is interested in. And quality is excellent in every way.  Highly instructive and most amusing. Highly recommended.",1057017600,,1759,4.962585034013605
