7877760,3,630479455X,"Not too crazy about Sister Wendy's personalizing her vision of Art  in a way that creates associative stories of her own.
Any Art historian would  never color an image with this kind of clap trap. So amazing that this has gone on for so long.",1406505600,,242,4.355555555555555

7877764,5,630479455X,"I was a fan of Sister Wendy's before this Interview.  I am a devotee now.  Sister Wendy has surely surprised us with her series on PBS - being simultaneously amusing and didactic.  But this interview with Bill Moyers  permits her to display her philosophy about art rather than her thoughts on  a specific piece, and in doing so gives us true food for thought.  She  extemporizes on the definition of Great Art so eloquently the listener is  forced to question his/her own beliefs about art.  While you will learn  some more about this amazing nun personally (some of which you might prefer  not to be confronted with, as it is painfully religious), you will also  come away with a completely new set of skills with which to experience art  for yourself.  This is the true value of the interview, for you can not but  come away forever changed by her thinking.  You may not agree with  everything she says, but there is no doubt whatsoever that she is one of  art's most impassioned teachers.  Personally, she truly changed my life.  I  have watched the Interview over and over, and plan to do so periodically  throughout my life.  She is never boring, never preaching (when she speaks  of art), but rather provocative and highly accessible.  I have taken the  ideas behind this interview and debated at length with many friends and  family.  These conversations are highly rewarding because they require no  special knowledge, just each person's opinion about what defines Great Art.  And thanks to this interview with Sister Wendy, this delightful subject is  being discussed in restaurants and coffee houses all over!  Thank you Bill  Moyers for making this possible.",943315200,27,1670,4.85
