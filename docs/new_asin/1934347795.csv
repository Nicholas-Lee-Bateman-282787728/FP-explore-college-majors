7801869,3,1934347795,"Does not describe anything. Basically it is a demonstration of different kata at full speed with no narrator explaining anything whatsoever. The kata are done very well, but this is not a teaching tool like the description implies. I was under the impression that this was an instructional video. It is pretty short too. I could see that it could be of some use to someone that just wants to watch for entertainment or as a reference for form, but that is about it.",1382227200,3,465,4.5476190476190474
7801870,5,1934347795,"I love to watch other styles and systems and purchase a lot of videos on Martial Arts. Most of what's for sale is questionable and you find out quality after you open the package and play. Quality of video and sound are usually a problem let alone the martial artist is not worth watching.
I have purchased nearly a dozen videos from ""Em3 Video"" and I can honestly say they have spent a lot of time in making sure you have a great quality video & sound. Due to this I have purchased another half a dozen videos of other styles I am interested in watching.
Great job EM3 Video.",1372723200,,576,4.245454545454545
