8122793,5,B0007ZAEDQ,Have watched a few times. Each time I'm picking up more and more.  Dirk has a very laid back delivery which is deceptive.  He really brings a lot of knowledge and experience to unraveling the mystery of the Cajun accordion.,1502323200,,223,4.55
8122794,5,B0007ZAEDQ,"At first I was less than thrilled with this DVD, but after considering what the artist might actually be trying to convey, especially to students who aren't accustomed to learning a tune primarily by listening and imitating (i.e.,the traditional way of learning cajun accordion), I had a change of heart.  If you're expecting note-by-note instruction, don't buy this DVD.  On the other hand, if you want to be pushed outside your comfort zone and take your playing to another level, then your money will be well spent.",1467331200,,518,4.942528735632184
8122795,5,B0007ZAEDQ,"In this second part of his cajun accordion instruction series Dirk Powell continues to clearly demonstrate techniques to help you learn to play the cajun style. He uses the philosophy of teaching you to ""fish"" by showing critical parts of the cajun accordion idiom to help you learn to play tunes, rather than just playing a bunch of tunes for you to learn. Mr Powell also shares his insight of what's hip and what's not cool to do within the cajun genre, giving us a rare insider's view.",1126915200,8,488,4.556818181818182
