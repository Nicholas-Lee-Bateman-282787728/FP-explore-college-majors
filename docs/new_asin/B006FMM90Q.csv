4985151,5,B006FMM90Q,I absolutely loved this movie!!! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  It is a MUST SEE.  I must have this movie in my DVD collection.  GREAT JOB to all of the people who had a hand in making this movie for all to enjoy!,1369699200,,229,3.63265306122449
4985152,4,B006FMM90Q,"Please note that I rented the movie due to the male lead...and to my surprise it was a very good movie.  It's not an action packed...thriller, but a feel good on the bounds of self-esteem ladden type of drama.  I love Indie films because they are made as intended without trying to fit the norm of the movie industry.",1352073600,,317,4.3559322033898304
4985153,3,B006FMM90Q,"Contrary to the first reviewers naive opinion, this movie does nothing to explain domestic violence.  It doesn't happen because of some physical or emotional trauma of an abuser.  Those are just handy excuses that the general public, and apparently the first reviewer, are willing to swallow.  It gives an abuser not only an excuse, but makes the abuser a victim in everyones eyes.  Abuse happens because an abuser feels ENTITLED to treat the victim however they want. The only person to blame for abuse is the abuser.  Not the victim, not his Mama or his Daddy, absolutely no one and nothing is to blame but the abuser, put the blame where it belongs, squarely on the abusers shoulders.

The only thing an abuser deserves or is entitled to is CONTEMPT.  The longer people keep accepting all the ""poor wittle me"" excuses abusers will spoon feed you the longer his victim suffers.",1343779200,2,879,4.781456953642384
4985154,4,B006FMM90Q,"This was a wonderful tale, of struggle that many women can relate to.  I believe this movie represented a honest view of the tuggle of war between a womans commitment to a relationship and her self worth.",1334534400,,204,4.513513513513513
4985155,4,B006FMM90Q,"I wasn't sure on if I would be interested in watching a film shot in Africa.  I am an american and never really seen such a film before.
I actually really enjoyed it. The cast was outstanding and the story was uniquely different. Normally, when I see
films about spousal abuse, it has no meaning and no reason why the 'abuse' has started, but here with this film.  It takes you step by step and really helps the audience understand the WHY it started...

I recommend it highly.  The production value is also very good.  Its kindda like Hollywood meets africa.  ..

Looking forward to checking out more of their films as well.",1327622400,5,625,4.477876106194691

8497115,5,B006FMM90Q,"Great movie that focuses on domestic violence. It captures the slow and steady progression of how abusers seem to ""transform over night"" from charming sweet partners to violent monsters. If you pay close attention to the film, Chima was abusive before the accident. He pressured her to marry him and also openly flirted with other women, etc. the list goes on. People often wonder why victims stay, and I think this film captures some of those common reasons.

Don't think that he ""changed"" because of the accident. Watch closely, he was manipulative from the beginning and used the accident as an excuse to justify the abuse- which is very common. "" I hit you because I drink"" or "" I hit you because I lost my job"" "" because you don't do this or that."" All taking the blame off where it belongs...  The abuser. Abuse is a choice, not an accident or a product of circumstance.",1466726400,,876,4.573248407643312
8497116,4,B006FMM90Q,"Great movie. I do not appreciate movies that show violence against women.
But this one draws you along.
Hope there will be a sequel soon.",1462320000,,137,4.52

8497121,5,B006FMM90Q,This movie was incredible the storyline was authentic and the acting was Superb. The way the movie ended was great however I say we need a part 2 for Jimah to redeem himself and fight for his family. I thought this was going to be an African film that I couldn't relate to. Boy was I wrong! I'm an American and was quite surprised at how well done this movie was. I could have been a little longer. However I enjoyed watching it and I would really love to see a part 2.,1401408000,,469,4.053763440860215
