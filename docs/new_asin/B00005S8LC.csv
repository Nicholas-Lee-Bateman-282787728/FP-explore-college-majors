I bought it because Louis Mandylor was in it and I wanted to add it to my collection.  It was still an ok movie and I did enjoy it.",1446940800,,282,3.7457627118644066
8197232,4,B00005S8LC,"The product itself arrived quickly and was in good condition, both the packaging and the DVD.  All the menus functioned properly and there were no playability issues with the movie itself as sometimes happens.

I enjoy the movie.  It become a bit darker as the movie progressed than I expected and the ending was sad, but a little bit of a surprise as well.  A movie doesn't always need a happy ending to be enjoyable and I did enjoy the movie.  There was plenty of action, a few plot twists and of course the main reason I purchased the movie, a really hot female asian actress lead.

True this wasn't a high budget block buster moview, but if you liked any of the Gun Crazy series you will enjoy this one as well.",1337558400,,715,4.338345864661654
