4134219,5,B003KXDI4E,"This was just a remarkable movie about an extraordinary young man who was taken way too soon.  I cannot say how much this touched my heart.  By the end of the film you will truly feel a loss for Nick and his family, and maybe that is Nicky's ultimate gift to touch people in death as much as he did in life.  The film maker was incredible to be able to capture this so perfectly on film.",1361664000,3,387,4.0
4134220,5,B003KXDI4E,"This tragedy touched the entire state of RI, a place where everybody knows everybody, or at least knows somebody who does. This film about the youngest victim deals with his premonitions of his own death, his family's grief, and their coming to terms with his continued existence on ""the other side."" I don't know if you wanna call it spiritual or spooky, but either way, a very moving film that opens your eyes to the possibilities of life after death and neverending love.",1289865600,4,474,4.72289156626506
4134221,4,B003KXDI4E,"Some things in life and death cannot be explained.  This film shares a story of a talented individual who's life is cut short too soon, and how his influence and presence is STILL felt to this day.  Call it spiritual/paranormal energy or communication - I know it gives me hope.",1281484800,4,278,4.54

8399080,1,B003KXDI4E,"I believe they have received signs that are meaningful to them, but I didn't find the signs compelling eniugh to make a documentary out of.  I expected the film to be much more inyeresting and moving than it actually was. I have recieved what i believe are signs from loved ones as well, but again I couldn't see  making a movie or a book or money of of it unless I had enough evidence to wow you. I was not wowed at all.",1425168000,,421,4.0602409638554215
