7986343,5,B00008QSB3,"Loosely based on the virtua fighter games, this anime does a good job fusing comedy, martial arts and old school storytelling. Akira Yuki aims to find the seven stars visible during the day by pure hearted warriors. Along the way he ends up facing a corrupt martial arts branch that seem hell bent on creating a violent form of martial arts to take over by brute force. This series is pretty old but the animation, voice overs and story hold up well enough to warrant five stars. Pick up this for the first season of virtua fighter anime. Get ready...Fight!",1429747200,2,557,4.58

7986346,5,B00008QSB3,As soon as I heard that there was an anime of one of my favorite game series I had to get this dvd. I watched online to see if it was good first and now I wish that more than 35 episodes more like 65-100. Virtua fighter fans if you like the game get the anime because it's very entertaining.,1359072000,,291,3.8666666666666667

7986349,5,B00008QSB3,"Virtua Fighter is one of those franchises that have been around for a while - and for a good reason.  The fighting games have always been fun to play, especially Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution whom many may say is the best fighting game out there.
The movies are, I believe, keeping up with the games when it comes to quality.  The characters included in the game is basically up to Virtua Fighter 3TB, which includes everybody except the newcomers (Lei Fei, Vanessa, Aoi, Brad Burns, etc) that came in Virtua Fighter 4 and Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution.  You get to see each character and their martial art discipline shine throughout the movies.  In fact, one of my favorite things about the movies is how it gives you a more detailed explanation of a specific special move that the character is using.  It's like watching both a great cartoon and a martial art move overview.
The soundtrack is quite catchy, and I must say that both the English and Japanese versions are nicely done.  What I do not like in many cases is when songs get translated, people tend to shove the translation into the same melody, which oftentimes make the song sound rushed.  This time, the English and the Japanese soundtracks are different.
The first round has started - and what a great start it is!",1068422400,11,1275,4.615044247787611
