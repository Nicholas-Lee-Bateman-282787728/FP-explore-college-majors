DVD comes with some cool Karuta card (like 4) with zetsubou-sensei characters and a poem or saying on them. My Japanese isn't good enought to tell you what they say. The DVD does not have any subtitles as far as I can tell (not even Japanese) from clicking every button on the menu screne.",1524268800,,449,4.2823529411764705

The main character ,Mr. Despair himself, is so completely over the top it makes you wonder why he isn't wrapped in a straight jacket threw the entire series. During this series you will find yourself laughing at suicide attempts and finding amusement in some of the real life stuff that comes up in this backwards world where every-time something goes a tiny bit wrong it becomes the end of the world.

Overall this is a great series, all the characters are extremely different and all very amusing. The little things they do like hiding the naughty bits of characters with the face of one of mangaka's assistants with the weirdest expression",1301529600,8,714,4.758064516129032
