4892866,4,B005TZFZ6U,"While not the best miniseries in the world, Day brings her experience as an actress and writer (assuming you're a fan of her work in Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, The Legend of Neil, and of course The Guild, among her contributions to various TV series). Day's a true Dragon Age fan, and it shows in her work. If you're a Dragon Age fan, or just a Felicia Day fan, give this a watch.

Of course, at the time of writing you can get the entire series, in 1080p, on YouTube.",1326758400,10,473,4.2555555555555555
4892867,1,B005TZFZ6U,"If you love cliche' acting, forced expressions, forced acting, poor acting, horrible acting... if you think your child's Christmas play was bad... this is worse.

I rented it online.  I stopped it about 40 mins in.  My brain was hurting from the poor acting... I just couldn't comprehend the stupidity any longer.

I suppose if you like E! Hollywood news and that sort of stuff that kills your brain cells, then this will likely be a hit for you!

If someone gave me this DVD I would use the paper for the cover to wipe my bottom, and I would use the DVD as a coaster.",1325289600,17,568,4.320754716981132

4892870,3,B005TZFZ6U,"The small web series is enjoyable to watch, but not for the current price of $14.95. For me there is no re-playability, unlike Felicia's The Guild series. I thought the acting was a bit lacking to be honest and not enough in the episodes. Save your money for future works by Felecia Day and watch this online.",1325030400,3,309,4.43859649122807
4892871,3,B005TZFZ6U,"As much as I truly love Felicia Day and have supported the Guild by buying the DVD's despite being able to watch online for free. I can not however encourage anyone to spend 14 dollars on this dvd. It claims a run time of 90 minutes, each of the 6(?) episode unless they've actually added content is only about 6 1/2 minutes long (if you take out the opening titles and ending titles.) I would say go onto youtube and check out dragon age redemption, if after a couple episodes you think this is a can't live with out then buy it. I figure it'll be on sale for 10 bucks down the road and I can pick it up then. It's worth seeing, just 14 bucks is too steep a price for it. I've had a crush on Felicia day since her diet coke commercial so it kind of pains me to say that, but like i said check it out and you may like it 14 dollars worth.

Pro: It was awesome after a couple years of watch the guild seeing Felicia in a feisty kick ass role. This whole thing looks very ""do it yourself"" which I'm fine with. That shows more love for the genre then anything I think television could manage.

Con: Some of the dialog is seriously lacking, not so much what is written but how it was delivered.

For me this one just missed the target. When I do buy it it'll strictly be in support of the idea, not so much the end product. You might ask why I'd buy it at all? Simple this stuff is not as easy as it seems. I have friends down in southern California who do everything from indie movie projects, to prop building, to weapons making for television. It's a lot of hard work getting your name out there for the stuff people take for granted, it's even more difficult to make your name as an actor/actress not to mention actually getting a product out. So I do encourage people to check it out. But that's all I can do.

They should sell the cover as a full sized poster, that would probably sell well.",1324771200,123,1893,4.108108108108108
4892872,3,B005TZFZ6U,"It's an enjoyable fantasy feature, with a good storyline, characters and low budget effects. It's worth the watch to see the creative solutions they come up with. I hope they make more, I'd like to see the adventure continue.",1324339200,6,225,4.794871794871795

4892877,1,B005TZFZ6U,HORRIBLE!  The first thing I noticed they kept interupting the movie with placing notes into the movie about why different things happened.  This was very DISTRACTING and happened throughout the the entire movie.  The movie trailer looked great BUT it did NOT represent the movie well at all.  I'm glad I rented it and did not buy it (which I was thinking of doing because of the Trailer)  Thank God I didn't buy it!!!!!,1485388800,2,420,4.621621621621622

Game mechanics are even shown in this little show as well as the scenery, but the banter is what we wish we could have during missions. I am subscribed to Felicia Day's channel, so I watched it there, but I may invest in this dvd just because Day deserves the recognition for all the hard work..",1483488000,,466,4.247191011235955

If you love Dragon Age, Felicia Day, or just nerds goofing around with the worlds that they love, this is for you.  Netflix or Amazon should pick this up as an Original show.",1461110400,,307,4.258620689655173
4892904,3,B005TZFZ6U,"Watch the FUNimation animated movie instead.  This film was reasonably entertaining.  Supposedly the segments with onscreen expository text serve to demarcate the 6 ""episodes"" stitched together to make this a movie.  Maybe that's how it was originally released online, but as a unified whole it's one movie so the ""6 episodes"" thing is a little misleading.  My local library streams this movie via the service Hoopla Digital, and I suppose it was worth spending one of my 8 monthly checkouts from that service on this movie.  It looks surprisingly good for a low-budget film.  Felicia Day and the mercenary warrior woman and the Warlock Big Bad were the best in terms of performances; the rest of the cast were adequate but have room for improvement.  The love story side seemed a little rushed...it wasn't bad but it could've been better.

Also, I wasn't a fan of the Elf ear prosthetics used for this movie, where the ears sweep outward, backward and down at a diagonal.  I'm used to Elf ears that look more like Star Trek Vulcan ears, smaller and pointing upward through long, flowing hair.  I got used to it over time, but at first blush it really took me out of the movie because I was staring at Day's unusual Elf ears that defied my aesthetic expectations.  Tallis's wisecracking persona won me over, at least.

Maybe they should've had more Elf to Elf dialogue; the ""Free"" Elf was kind of a pushover; the conflict would've been more interesting if that character had been more of a zealot for Elvish independence.

I guess I wasn't sold on the solidity of the love relationship (I viewed it as more lusty attraction without much emotional depth yet) such that I found Tallis's abandoning her mission, when she easily could have completed it on time, under budget, as ordered....a little bit straining credulity...  It would've been more interesting for her to complete the mission as ordered but deeply conflicted inside.",1459468800,,1929,4.841463414634147

4892910,3,B005TZFZ6U,"The movie was not as great as I was lead to believe. There was too much ""Story Telling script"" in the movie, I guess it was low budget and they could not make the action scenes needed to stay under budget and decided to let the audience read the story.

Honesty, I enjoyed it. No, it is not big studio quality but then why would anyone expect that from this fan made film? Anyway, I thought the story line and characters made perfect sense and fit well into the Dragon Age universe.
It's very short. I think there were 5 10-12 minute episodes on youtube. It's worth watching online if you're curious or a Dragon Age fan but I think pretty much only hardcore collectors will want to buy this.",1446595200,,561,4.352380952380952

I'd still say it would be a good film for any lover of Dragon Age - not anywhere near as good as Dawn of The Seeker, but still okay.",1426377600,2,406,4.151898734177215

4892959,4,B005TZFZ6U,"A few things to keep in mind with this short webseries.  It was not given an enormous budget, as it was a supplement to other materials in the Dragon Age universe, not a primary media release.  I loved it, I thought the costuming was fun, and I love Felicia Day's quirky character, though at times Tallis's dialogue felt a little over-the-top, like she was trying too hard to be witty.  No, it's not blockbuster caliber, but it's an interesting insight into the world of the Dragon Age religious faction known as the Qunari.  It's great for anyone who is a fan of the Origins game's Codex entries - this gives lots of tidbits about Qunari culture.

One of the things I really loved was that it utilized techniques your character can learn in the Dragon Age game into the cinema - Force Field, the Shield Bash, and a couple of others.  It was good attention to detail, performed in the spirit of the genre.",1406246400,,905,4.487804878048781

The special effects are horrible, but the story and characters make the Dragon Age universe just a little bit deeper. However, there's no connection to Dawn of the Seeker (other than a quick mention of Cassandra) or the Mark of the Assassin DLC, aside from Tallis's presence. There's no deep philosophy or anything.

I love Felicia Day, but this is not up to her usual quality

Costumes were not great.  Special effects bad. Story not the best.

Given that this was a tie in to a DLC for the Dragon Age game, I'm somewhat surprised they just didn't use her motion capture image and just have the web series as animated shorts using the game engine and graphics. At least it would have looked much better.

I would not recommend buying it.  Just look for it online.  I know she will do better things in the future.  But this was just not her best work.

For fan service, video with a meager budget I would give it a 4.  For most people who aren't the fan of the series I would give it a 2 so I guess it average out to a 3.

Good:
+It is true to Dragon Age in term of subject matter.
+I am a big fan of DA
+effects were better then I expected
+very good if it was compared to most youtube short movies.
+obviously most male viewers would like the main actress, most other characters were a goofy bunch.

Bad:
-it was very short.  If you skip most of the DA commercial and preview of the next episode you can watch the whole thing in 30-40mins.
-not much overall
-I been to cosplay convention and think some of those costume are better (cooler) then some in this movie.  Plasticity cloth and rubberish armor here.

Neutral since it was low budget
*Acting was ok, obviously some chessy lines

As long as DA release any new games and movies i will play and watch them all regardless it they are bad.  (I watched all the RE movies even, and I can say it is getting too chessy.

She's supposed to be some awesome rogue and it just makes me want to die every time she does a spinny knife move and then makes some 'witty' remark that isn't even funny.  How on earth did she get asked to do the DLC for DA2 and this honestly bad web series?

Also, this is completely free on youtube- go watch it there before buying.  We all know the majority of the buyers will be gamer boys who have a crush on her anyway for 'research' purposes.

With the DLC of Tallis -- a unique, serious-yet-hilarious elf rogue who follows the Qun -- being my second favorite DLC (only barely under Witch Hunt in DA:O), I had to watch the live action web series.

If you can look past the odd-looking Qunari and seeing Dragon Age in real life, this series is wonderful. It feels like the Dragon Age universe, you find out of a part of Thedas away from Gray Wardens and Kirkwall, and you find out much more about this red-headed elf that you casually get to flirt with in DA2 while messing with upper class Orleseans.

Felicia did an amazing job in this, as did all of the other actors. I think it's a must for any Dragon Age fan. Although, since it's all on YouTube for free?

The other character's are generic, unlikeable, and over act. The swords, staffs and other weapons looked like you can buy them at a Toys R Us. I will say that the outfits were pretty good though.

What I like about it, was that it did play well off the Lore of the Dragon Age Games.

4893011,4,B005TZFZ6U,"I have to admit, like a lot of other fan boys, I have a crush on Ms Day for quite a while.  So, buying DragonAge:Redemption was a no brainer for me.  DA:R takes the background from the game, and makes a decent show.  Its a low budget affair, and it shows, but the acting and the general fun of the episodes make up for it.  DA:R is not perfect by any means, but the cast for the most part sells the storyline, and the costumes and props are spot on from the game.

 Ms Day plays Tallis, an elf who is trying to redeem herself for her masters in capturing an escaped mage.  In true gaming fashion, Tallis meets up with others along her way and they form an adventuring group to hunt down the escaped mage.  Its pretty standard stuff, but its pretty much what DragonAge is about. Ms Day wrote the script as well, and did a pretty good job.

The making of extras are pretty good, if you are into seeing how movies are made.  There are about as many of those as the run time of the episodes of the story.

Casual viewers and folks that are not big fans of Ms Day or of the Dragonage video game are more than likely be content with watching the episodes on youtube, but folks that like extras, and Fans may like having the DVD

The video transfer was ok, there were a few glitches in the first episode, but seemed to smooth out on my player.  The sound was good, but standard audio, not an expanded 5.1 or anything.

I think if you are a fan of Ms Day, its worth the 6 dollars or so Amazon is wanting for it now, ITs not the best movie I have paid for, and by for not the worse.

I would add, that I would like to see more of Ms Day's character,",1332806400,3,1640,4.018518518518518
4893012,5,B005TZFZ6U,"I bought this purely on the strength of Dragon Age and my love for Felicia Day.  Why was Felicia Day doing a Dragon Age set of shorts?  I didn't know.  I hadn't watched these online.  I watch the guild and really enjoy Felicia--but how would that translate into an actual fantasy game?  Frankly, this web series knocked my socks off.  Here's why:

1. Story:
Writing a snarky show like the Guild is not at all the same as writing a fantasy adventure (like DA:R), but I am happy to say that the story is ultimately what made this a 5 star set for me.  Humor, which is so hard to do well in a fantasy setting, came out wonderfully.  But more importantly, I was rapidly introduced to a completely new world, told in broad strokes with surprisingly deft skill.  I was introduced rapidly to characters who I genuinely enjoyed.  And in these short eps, I came to care about a ragtag band of adventurers, brought together for different reasons to confront a common evil.  Yes, I know, it relies on a lot of fantasy tropes.  That's ok.  It is exactly what we love in fantasy.  But DA:R does this very well.  I was caught up in the adventure, and although my wife and I started this one night with the intent of watching only 1-2 episodes and then going to bed, we were unable to stop until we had completed the entire thing.  We ended it with a smile on our faces.  Great adventure.

2. Characters:
Tallis, Cairn, and Josmael, and Nyree, as well as the big bad Saarebas, all had to be drawn in and outlined in a rather short period of time.  If characterization flops, if you don't care about these folks as people, then the story fizzles.  Fortunately, you do care.  Not one but two love stories, an amusingly bawdy dalliance (Nyree: You have done this before, right? Josmael: No, never  Nyree: Then do it for Fina!] , and backstory that was convincingly told and not shoehorned in all fit side by side.  By the end, when tragedy strikes our band of adventurers, you feel the loss.

3. Music:
Very enjoyable.  Done by a young composer who really created a wonderful backdrop without becoming a showboat.  Added a lot to the atmosphere.

4. Production:
I have no idea what the budget on this production was--it was undoubtedly miniscule by any film standard.  And it shows--you can't make magic out of thin air.  But for the budget that they had, they used every penny well.  I have seen many a TV show in my time that WISHED it looked this good.  It is a testimony to how much things have changed that this is definitely up to TV standards from not that long ago.  The cinematography is actually quite interesting--Peter Winther's direction is smart and interesting.  The camera is often in motion in interesting ways, adding a lot of perceived action to the affair.  Costumes are pretty good. No, we're not talking LOTR quality here.  But certainly the costumes are acceptable, and at times, amazing.  Doug Jones make up as Saarebus would not have been out of place on Buffy or Angel.  Cairn's armor design looked just like the game, although it didn't look substantial enough for my taste.  Tallis' outfit was apparently a pretty complex thing to design, but in the end, I think that they could have done just as well with leather as they did with latex/foam, but that's just my thought.  Nyree looked amazing.  Josmael looked fine, but I really wanted to brush the hair out of his face.

And the ears?  Perfect.

5. The Extras:
Surprisingly large quantity of extra material--there are a lot of TV seasons that don't have half the amount of extras of this set.  If you are always interested to know about the behind the scenes stuff, as I am, this is great.  You feel like you get to be a part of putting this production together, and that is fun.  Commentaries on every episode? Yes, please. Especially when they are fun and done by the star of the show!  Blooper's reel? yep, and some of it was actually funny (bloopers reels are often funny for the cast, i think, but not so much for the audience).  Plus, I didn't realize that there was any DLC for DA:II, and now I'll go back and play Tallis myself!

In the end, I <3 this little web series, and think that it raises the bar of what can be done with not much.
I can't imagine anyone doing better than this on a shoestring budget, and I can't imagine most folks doing better even with a bigger budget.  Perhaps the best thing that I can say after watching it is that I wish there were more, and I hope that there is a second season (although I doubt there will be one).  Fans of the Guild, rejoice.  Fans of DA, rejoice.  This is a lot of fun in a little series.",1332115200,7,4610,4.425
4893013,2,B005TZFZ6U,"I'm a fan of Dragon Age and Dragon Age 2 games (PC).  I've finished the DLC ""Mark of the Assassin"" and sadly found Felicia Day's voice acting, annoying and not believable in comparison to voice acting in Dragon Age and Dragon Age 2.  I'm not sure if this is due to the writers for the DLC game, production time/cost etc.

Mark of the Assassin is supposed to be intertwined with DA: Redemption, so I watched the first two episodes online.  I really tried to like it because I am a fan of the series, but I had the same issues with believability. It seems to be a small budget production and the uneven acting abilities shows.  The story line could use some help, too.

Seriously though, it's really hard to translate games/comic books onto film.  It has been done but you need a director with vision and a budget to match.

Dragon Age Redemption isn't the highest quality show out there, as it runs on a low budget, so don't expect a Lord of the Rings quality film. Yet the show was presentable and I appreciated the dialogue, specially Felicia Day's humor. Special effects are tacky, with funny looking blood being splattered around, but that was about the only noticeable fault I could detect.

4893019,3,B005TZFZ6U,"With geek goddess Felicia Day being such a diehard gamer, it shouldn't come as a surprise that she's gone and written and starred in a six-part web series based on the Dragon Age video game franchise. Her DRAGON AGE: REDEMPTION shares the same setting as DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS and takes place during the same time period as in DRAGON AGE II. This six-part web series, when seen in its entirety, runs at around 51 minutes. Is that worth the DVD's asking price? How much are you a fan of Felicia Day? How hardcore of a gamer are you? How much are you willing to support the web series medium?

This is what I picked up from the web series: In the world of Dragon Age, two races are superior over others, wielding power by virtue of their respective and competing religions. Man governs thru his church, called the Chantry, his rules enforced by the Chantry's devoted and exceptionally trained Templar warriors. The Qunari, a race of grey giants, adhere to an even harsher gospel. In this reality rogue mages are hunted without remorse by the Templars. The Qunari frown even more at their rogue mages, binding them, keeping them leashed, dubbing them ""Saarebas,"" which means ""Dangerous Thing.""

In this reality elves are society's bottom feeders. Tallis (Day), once an assassin for the Qunari, had been demoted to the rank of common laborer. But, as the first episode opens, Tallis finds herself with one last stab at redemption when she's deployed to recapture an escaped rogue Qunari mage (Doug Jones). Enroute, she runs into the Chantry Templar, Cairn (Adam Rayner), and the mutual distaste is palpable, even though Tallis comes off all flirty. To Tallis' concern, Cairn is tracking the very same ""Saarebas."" Even though from opposing sides, they reluctantly join forces. We knew they would. The fellowship of two is soon bolstered by the addition of the lovesick Dalish elf healer, Josmael (Masam Holden), and the murderous Reaver, Nyree (Marcia Battise who does her best Grace Jones impression). Off they go on their quest, pausing just long enough to awkwardly bond in a tavern and brawl it up against a gang of fearsome mercenaries.

I'm not much of a gamer. I'm not that familiar with the DRAGON AGE video game franchise. If you're like me, odds are that watching this web series may not compel you to try out the game. I do think that Felicia Day does a good job of catching us up with the DRAGON AGE mythology and world view. And maybe the constraints of a web series hampered her writing, but the storytelling isn't really up to snuff, what with clichs piggybacking on clichs. Although I think the cast is decent (I won't ever disparage the awesome Doug Jones), the clunky dialogue sabotages their efforts.

Felicia Day undermines her own character. Or maybe it's my bias. Felicia Day is so adorable that she's a hard sell as a no-nonsense assassin. Also, although Tallis and Cairn engage in banter and you sense a spark between them, that late kiss still seems jarring. It makes me think that Day just didn't invest enough in their interactions. But I do like what Tallis does to test the young elf's claim that he was a skilled healer.

I first saw this web series online, but I bought this DVD anyway. I'm down with the web series as a growing medium. DRAGON AGE: REDEMPTION hints at what the web series is capable of, that it can aspire to more ambitious narratives. Given the meager budget, I was fairly impressed with the costumes and set pieces. I admire the make-up work and the scope they were striving for. Having said all that, I still prefer THE GUILD.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""Bringing the Game to Life"" - the Making Of featurette (00:02:57 minutes)
- Segments focusing on Characters, Costumes, and Stunts
- Blooper Reel (00:02:52)
- A peek at DRAGON AGE ORIGINS, DRAGON AGE II, DRAGON AGE II: LEGACY DLC, and DRAGON AGE II: MARK OF THE ASSASSIN DLC
- 2-Part Bioware TV Interview with Creative Director Mike Laidlaw
- Bioware TV Interview with Felicia Day (00:03:17)
- Commentary by Felicia Day and director Peter Winther (although his audio levels seem way low; I could barely hear him)
- Script on PDF",1330646400,6,4125,4.712898751733703
4893020,3,B005TZFZ6U,"It is a collection of short mini episodes. Not worth what they are charging, but an enjoyable view. I enjoy Dragon Age, but by selling this collection on dvd at almost $9 feels kind of crazy.",1329177600,,191,4.333333333333333
4893021,2,B005TZFZ6U,"I wanted to like this. I totally admire the tremendous writing, etc., that Felicia Day brings to The Guild.

But here the dialogue is uneven, the story is just okay, and the acting is clunky. Wooden describes Adam Rayner as the male lead. Day's acting was good at times and freaking awkward at other times; just not convincing. The only actor who seemed to dive into their role nicely was Marcia Battise.

Sadly, it ends up coming off more as a good LARP adventure with decent costumes rather than a good series.

Verdict: Watch on the net and buy the DVD if you really want to watch it a second time.",1328745600,3,601,4.396396396396397
4893022,1,B005TZFZ6U,"As a fan of both Felicia Day and the Dragon Age series, I can say honestly that I didn't enjoy this webseries at all. The acting isn't particularly great, and the series itself conflicts in a lot of ways with the Dragon Age games and novels' canon. If you want to see it, watch the series on youtube. It has some good moments, but overall isn't worth buying. It falls flat.",1328054400,12,373,4.267605633802817

8486637,4,B005TZFZ6U,"Okay, I got this purely because of Felicia Day.  I was hoping seeing her in something this dorky would erase from my memory her performance from that train wreck Mystery Science Theater relaunch on Netflix..

Redemption has *way* better production value and acting than I would have expected.  Felicia Day herself was one of the weaker actors, so that surprised me.  The movie is only about forty minutes long and it's broken up into six episodes under ten minutes each.  But the quality and comptetency of the filmmaking was much better than a web series.  You probably need to have played Dragon Age beforehand.",1495584000,3,613,4.846153846153846
