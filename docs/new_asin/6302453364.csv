This film should not be confused or compared to Cat People (1942.) This film is from a different era and is more of a spooky horror movie then Cat people.

This is a psychological thriller about unrequited love. It is a tad strange in that Leonora is sent to an institution to recover from trauma; then let out of the institution to recover from the trauma of being institutionalized.

In any event the film is fun to watch with lots of opportunity to kibitz.",1525996800,,598,4.418181818181818

She doesn't believe it at first but becomes convinced going to a psychiatrist who doubts her story until the cool ending.i recommend the dvd",1496534400,,413,4.447368421052632
7825798,2,6302453364,"This AIP-imported British suspenser gives a very young and pretty Barbara Shelley the role Simone Simon played in Lewton and Tourneur's original masterpiece. She holds her own, although the movie itself cannot as a rule measure up.
The movie transplants to then-present-day England the story of a jealous woman, who may or may not be marked with a family curse to kill when her passions are provoked. The change is that her family keeps a panther on their estate, and rather than change into the cat per se, she may be possessed by its spirit. Which presents an obvious plot hole absent from the 1942 version: why not just off the feline and be done with the curse?
It's adequately done, and Shelley has wicked fun (in that campy, low-key British style on display in Michael Gough films of the 60's), but the film is as a whole a plodding affair.
Lewton was famous for building suspense without showing anything, although studios usually muddled with his plans and forced sloppily clear endings or scenes into his films. This movie takes that intentional ambiguity a step further- too far- forgetting to include any suspense at all. That is, at least, until a nicely-staged and atmospheric climax on the dark and foggy London streets.
But much too little, too late.
Not without merit, and with a plot much the same, but a definite step or two down the ladder from the influential film it tries to emulate. Recommended only to completists and Shelley fans.",1019692800,10,1455,4.777777777777778
