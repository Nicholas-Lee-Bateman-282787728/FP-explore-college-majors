8271144,5,B0018TN766,"This animated short film was worth the time and money spent.  Chris Lackey and Chad Fifer are natural funny men and this treatment of what it would be like to become a god is 97% gold, less a few slow spots.  It's hard to believe that Tim Curry, Traci Lords (!) and Chris Sarandon could be brought together at all, let alone for a small project like this, but they were.  Hang on to that casting director.  This is not Bruce Almighty or George Burns, that's all I'll say.  Buy it, watch it.  Then watch it again",1378857600,,511,4.216494845360825
8271145,4,B0018TN766,"Check out this original animated feature film for a lot of laughs and a thought provoking message at the heart of it all!  Don't expect Pixar-like animation here -- the movie is done in a simple 2D flash animated style -- but it has terrific, all-star voice talent and provides a unique & entertaining experience all ages can enjoy!",1229817600,,332,4.627118644067797
8271146,1,B0018TN766,"I bought this based on the reviews and description, and was very disappointed.  First of all, the production values are incredibly low... I'm not sure how they ever convinced actors like Tim Curry and Laura Prepon to have anything to do with this project, because it looked like someone did the whole thing in Flash on their home computer.  The animation was terrible, the music sounded like it was done on a Casio keyboard, and the script was just embarrassing.  I guess there were some amusingly irreligious or perhaps ""thought-provoking"" parts, but overall it sort of struck me as some undergrad's Philosophy & Creative Writing project. I suppose it's a question of context.  If I had seen this as someone's college project, I would have thought it was fairly cool.  But I was expecting an ACTUAL MOVIE, with the level of quality and production values that one would expect from a professional animated film.  Don't buy this unless you are a fan of amateur home animation and sophomore-level philosophy.",1222473600,,1006,4.923076923076923
8271147,5,B0018TN766,"I saw this film in an advanced screening and was extremely impressed. It has a unique tone, successfully blending its wacky humor and nerdy references with some surprisingly stimulating religious commentary.  From the opening scene, we're seduced by Tim Curry's velvety-voiced Lucifer who tells the story of perpetual slacker, Lou, and his mysterious destiny. As the narrative unfolds, what is so fresh and original about this film is the on slot of quirky gags and eccentric supporting characters, all products of the extreme reverence and appreciation for movie geekdom that this film exudes.  The film also successfully rides the difficult line of poking fun at religious traditions while never feeling mean-spirited. Instead it teeters between cynical and genuinely sweet in its existential wanderings, while still managing to throw in some soccer-playing ninjas and robots, a hilarious peek into the complex chain of Beelzebub's inner spy network, and a random imaginary mech.  What?! Yeah...you need to check this movie out.",1217548800,4,1030,5.465408805031447
8271148,4,B0018TN766,"I picked this DVD up at Comic-Con, because I saw that Chris Sarandon was in it, and I've always been a fan of his. I had no idea what awaited me when I popped it into the DVD player, but I loved it!  ""The Chosen One"" is a quirky, delightful animated feature with a relaxed, offbeat sense of humor that compliments its sincerity.

The plot- involving the adventures of a dweeby everyguy named Lou who discovers his superpowers, and encounters temptation in the form of Lucifer (Tim Curry)- is familiar, but it's not bland or formulaic.  The everyguy hero is a doofus, but he's smart; his sidekicks are endearing, and the story- which includes a diverse band of hired killers, a cult called ""The Church of Frank,"" and a divine hill in Kansas- takes a number of unexpected twists and turns.  The voice acting is especially fine.  Tim Curry makes a terrific Lucifer, both dapper and ominous, and Chris Sarandon is hilarious- and nearly unrecognizable- in the role of Zebulon Kirk, Lou's ancient roommate.  As for the animation, I loved the character designs- I found them adorable- and the whole look of the movie was refreshingly non-CGI'ed.  ""The Chosen One"" manages to be both entertaining and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it!",1217462400,5,1234,4.819905213270142
8271149,5,B0018TN766,"The Chosen One is ridiculous amounts of fun to watch. Right off the bat you get Tim Curry as a golden-haired, snappily-dressed Lucifer, introducing the characters and story, centering around Lou (perfectly played by Chad Fifer), who is having the roughest day imaginable - fired, dumped by his girlfriend (Laura Prepon of That 70s Show fame), kicked out of the apartment he shares with his old man room-mate (Chris Sarandon of Princess Bride and Nightmare Before Christmas wonderful-ness)...and lots more stuff you can only achieve with animation unless you have millions of dollars to spend on effects and bears. Chris Lackey - director and lead animator does an awesome and hilarious job with what he has been quoted as calling his 'crappy animation'.

My family watched it together and everyone from the 7 year old, through the cynical teenagers, to my 84 year old Catholic grandmother, completely loved it. The satire on organized religion (Lou is declared The Chosen One by The Church of Frank, who send him to Kansas to meet God - and all the major religions are dispatched to stop him - Lance Henriksen of Aliens is a particular favorite as a Cardinal) is gentle but thought-provoking.

Highly recommended!",1217289600,2,1213,5.0
