2921536,5,B000UFIYQ2,"Who else out there misses Johnny Carson as much as I do????  No one has been able to even close to replacing him in the 15 years that he has been off the air.  While all of this box set has been for sale before in different forms and pieces over the past few years, having it all together in one set, and really at a terrific price for 12 discs, is great for a collector like me.",1193356800,10,379,3.8461538461538463
2921537,5,B000UFIYQ2,"I joined the Carson Club a few years back and got 6 DVD's over 6 months for well over $100. Now, Timeless Moments is being offered - which is the same content - along with 3 other collections for less than $100!  I wish this set had been available back then!  The packaging looks really cool.  If Amazon drops the price further during the holidays, I might just have to buy it anyway for the other sets inside.",1193356800,13,410,4.230769230769231
2921538,5,B000UFIYQ2,"I would love to review this ultimate Johnny Carson collection but how, without seeing it first?  Has it been released somewhere else?  I find the 2.5 star rating given before the set is even released, a little disconcerting at this point.
As I cannot view this product first and Amazon insists I give it a rating, I can only ""review"" it based on my prior experiences with Carson and the Tonight Show.  This has to mean 5 Star.  I hope I am not dissapointed.
I know that this collection will be worth the purchase price but I do hope that the collection is not a re-hash of the same programming released in past years.
Why not, for instance, a collection of the ""behind the commercials"" wonderfull big band breaks we were not fortunate enough to be able to watch, led by the intimidable Doc Severinson?
Ah... happy days!",1193097600,4,819,4.513513513513513
2921539,1,B000UFIYQ2,"This is the second time (at least) that this company has put previously released material in a new wrapper.  30 years of Carson and we keep getting a rehash (and rehash of rehash!) of previous titles.  If the company and Mr. Carson's estate are too inept or lazy to dig a little deeper into the tens of thousands of hours of available Carson-era ""Tonight Show"" material, then just release DVDs of the old syndicated cut-up series ""Carson's Comedy Classics"", or even the old prime-time anniversary specials.  We'd finally get to see some new material with minimal effort on the company's end.",1192492800,54,591,4.8316831683168315
2921540,5,B000UFIYQ2,"As a big Johnny fan - I own most of the DVD collections in this set, and as other reviewers have pointed out - these are DVDs that have been available at select retailers or to fans who bought DVDs through the Carson Club. However, this is the first time they have all been put together in one big box set, and at this price it is an incredible deal(around 5 bucks per DVD), and a great retrospective of Johnny's career.  The 3 disc Ultimate Collection is perhaps the best ""TV on DVD"" set ever released, and in the comics collection you get to see how some of today's biggest stars (Seinfeld, Drew Carey, Ellen and many more) got their start.  I am ordering as gifts, as this would be a terrific addition to any home video collection, and everyone loves and misses Johnny!",1191974400,21,772,4.354166666666667
2921541,1,B000UFIYQ2,"Johnny Carson was awesome...but he was on TV for decades. So why does this company continue to rehash the same stuff, only with different packaging? The Carson Tonight Show years were vast and they could be releasing so much MORE content, but instead it's the same clips over and over again. I bought the ""Ultimate Collection"" originally and LOVED it. Then, they changed the box cover which seemed to be misleading to fans as though it was something different. Now, this mega-box includes the ""Ultimate Collectin"" AGAIN! If you are a Johnny fan like me, then you may have purchased the DVDs that were only available through the Carson Club on his website. Well, be warned...all of those titles that were supposedly exclusive to the Carson Club are also in this box! My guess is the die-hard Carson fans have every bit of this material already. Check what you have and know what this is beofre you spend a dime!",1191628800,241,910,4.69375
2921542,1,B000UFIYQ2,"Hold your wallets until more is known.

The description says that the The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection is included. If that is so, then you may not want this set either. The Ultimate Collection is cropped---especially the last show---the entire music segment is deleted.

I fully understand why something like this can happen. The music publishers believe their product is gold and ask ridiculous licensing fees to have their music in these box sets. Regardless, no warning is given to the consumer from the DVD makers, so that is the reason for this early review. Remember, once you break the seal, your money is gone.",1189728000,102,624,4.933333333333334
2921543,5,B000UFIYQ2,"The Tonight Show has had 4 permanent Hosts:

1.) Steve Allen was the first. When Allen left, a number of temporary hosts filled in for awhile.

2.) Jack Paar was the most sophisticated, and under appreciated.

3.) Jay Leno is an above average comedian, who had the misfortune to follow the show's greatest host.

4.) Johnny Carson, the king of the late night talk shows.

This 12 DVD set promises the best of the 30 year tenure of Carson/McMahon, which is difficult, and a task I don't envy the editors of the set. More than likely the set had to be pared down, because there probably could have been 50 disks. Carson was renown and respected for his innovations, and his desire to put forth new talent. Stand-ups such as Steve Martin, Jerry Seinfeld, and more owe a large debt to Carson for helping to start their careers.

I for one, can't wait....",1188259200,16,850,4.522875816993464

2921581,3,B000UFIYQ2,"If you are a Johnny Carson fan, you might really like this DVD.  I was hoping to see more celebrity guests.  There are a lot of ""regular people"" guests.  There are quite a few of Carson skits.

There are several DVD's included.  A comedian DVD.  A Christmas DVD.  There are some fun guests to watch, such as magicians.  I found that there were repeats.  The whole final show is on one of the discs, yet on another disc is excerpts from the final show.  I don't think that was needed.  The box boasts of 23,000 guests through out the years  and they REPEAT some of the same guests on different DVD's in the set!!!!.  There was also a story of his life.  That was very interesting.

I bought this for my husband.  I am sure he will enjoy it, but like I said, I would have really seen more guests.  There are hardly any singing guests.  There is so much more they could have done to represent Johnny better.",1426204800,6,904,4.2485207100591715

I was very young when Johnny Carson hosted the Tonight Show, so it was very interesting to see the show in my 30s.  Some of the jokes and skits they pulled back then were a lot racier than I would have expected.

2921619,2,B000UFIYQ2,Seen much of this before. They keep rehashing the same stuff. With nearly 30 years of material you'd think they'd come up with new footage. Would pass of you've seen of own other collections.!,1388793600,,192,4.676470588235294
2921620,5,B000UFIYQ2,I purchased this for a Christmas present and was a total hit. Do not need to buy anything else to enjoy Johnny!!!,1388534400,,113,4.181818181818182
2921621,4,B000UFIYQ2,"When the price finally went down on this set, I decided to buy it.  My original 3 VHS Tapes are buried in a storage bin so it was time for a DVD upgrade.  It's a shame that most of Johnny's earlier years weren't saved, but all of the DVDs in this collection have some wonderful stars and terrific jokes.  There can never be enough Mighty Carson Art Players, Carnac, or Johnny's adventures with animals!  Jim Fowler and Joan Embry are perfect foils for Carson's sense of humor. All of these segments are paced very well with the TONIGHT SHOW guests.

There are 2 drawbacks.  Not enough music from Doc and The Band...along with the fact that a lot of the same stuff gets recycled over and over.  It seems to me that some of the DVDs were padded...and even then, the running time for the segments bottomed out at 47 minutes.

Ironically...the weakest collection is the 2-Disc Comedian Set.  Most of the material is either topic sensitive or just isn't funny.  I spent one morning watching Disc #1. Jerry Seinfeld, Garry Shandling and a few others tried to be hilarious...but they weren't!  Carson was laughing in the background and I kept saying to myself: ""This is not really FUNNY!""  What surprised me was the fact that some of the lesser known comedians....who made only 1 or 2 TONIGHT SHOW appearances....made a better impression.  Also...Roseanne Barr was really funny.  [There's a separate segment on another DVD pitting David Letterman and Joe Piscopo together which is hilarious].

What made me appreciate this set was the fact that I've just finished Henry Bushkin's ""JOHNNY CARSON book.  Bushkin was Johnny's Legal Representative and close friend for roughly 20 years.  Johnny occasionally referenced him (""Bombastic Bushkin"") in some of his monologues.  There was definitely a public and private side to Johnny which I tried to decipher while watching this set.

To sum it up...""Heeere's Johnny"" is a good retrospective when it comes to 3 decades of late night entertainment.  Carson set a high bar which few of his successors have been able to match.  For those of us who appreciate and still miss Johnny...try and ignore the repetition.  Take the set for what it is...a piece of comedic history performed by a genius who could coax a laugh out of practically anybody!",1384905600,4,2277,4.829457364341085

Good content but not smooth transitions, guest appearances chopped up, and the Tonight Show band music cut out and some lame small group music laid into the track.

Years ago, before I acquired the repackaged stuff that's contained in this set, I would have given it the five stars.  But, honestly, why would any serious fan purchase this??  Some consumers state that they ""wish"" they'd purchased this before they bought....you know the rest.  The mantra of the ripped off buyer.  So, the value of this box set radically fluctuates according to whether you have collected previously released materials.

Although, the skits that Johnny was able to do...the cast of characters that he had access to...and the personalities that he was able to emulate will NEVER be matched...live is just too serious now.

2921663,5,B000UFIYQ2,"My earliest memories of television (we did not get TV in our house until my high school years) were watching two things with my Dad:  The Six Day War in 1967, and watching Johnny Carson on Friday nights and during school vacations.  I learned about politics and humor, and how to play nice while being funny, from watching The Tonight Show with Mr. Carson.  He introduced so many of today's greatest comics, but none were as consistently funny and fresh, without being mean.  And several of his characters are still classically funny and relevant.  In his day the guests stayed and interacted with each other, which added to the fun.  His final episode was as touching as the last episode of M*A*S*H.

My parents are in their 80's now, they have been married for over 60 years, and this past year I bought them collections of Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, and M*A*S*H for Christmas and their anniversary.  Both Mom and Dad are having problems with their memories, and they are enjoying these collections immensely, and they are helping Mom and Dad remember some of the fun times and sad occurrences of the last 75 years.

2921668,5,B000UFIYQ2,"And what have we been given? Just a mere smattering of the performers, skits, music and desk side chatter from the world's ultimate next day's water cooler show. I cannot believe it!

Please issue DVDs of selected full shows. I remember that so many shows were great not because of any single performer but because of the entirety of the whole program, from monologue to conclusion.

I recently purchased the big box set and it's really nice to have these performances of this comedian or that country star. Or some of the memories and the heart breaking last two shows. I gave it 5 stars just for the emotional aspects, the nostaligic reasons, to be able to once again catch a few glimpses of the finest talk and entertainment show this nation's ever had. I owe Johnny that.

But really what's really missing are the banter between Johnny and his many personal close friends and fellow performers, the interviews, Johnny just being Johnny letting others have their time in the spot light but always adding his quips and charming laughter, his suave cosmopolitan presence anchoring the whole thing.

In all these DVDs there's really precious little of Johnny himself!

We fans, fans of all ages, would greatly appreciate having DVDs of many selected full shows. Especially at its peak during the late '60s through the '70s when so many of the classic stars, now long gone (Bob Hope, Dean Martin, etc) AND the up and coming newer stars who are still around today were all mingling together on the hour and a half shows.

Whole DVDs could be devoted to the appearances of specific guests like Jimmy Stewart, Bob Hope, and so many others.

Not only were there an awful lot of incredibly funny stuff back then. But I easily recall, especially on the shows before it went down to just one hour, the great conversations he had with so many people!

After what for many of us was the better portion of our TV lives spent watching The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson to only have the little that's been doled out is, in many ways, very sad. That show provided so much in the way of coloring our culture and it and we deserve more that the nice, but very stingy, teasers from all those years, really the best years of American culture at its peak.

Please, please consider doing so much more than just what's been done.

2921672,5,B000UFIYQ2,"It really is cool to have virtually everything ever released on DVD by Carson's Tonight Show all in one package...but, it would have been even nicer to include another large collection of as-yet-unreleased material. This box is a compilation of Carson Country, Animal Hijinks, the 3 DVD Ultimate Carson set, Stand Up Comedians and the Timeless Moments collection that was previously available to the Carson club members (some of these Timeless Moments can all be found in the recent release The Best Of Carson Volume 1).

I can also confirm that the 3 DVD Ultimate Carson set has been edited from it's original release, because I own the original release and was able to see what was cut out, most notably the montage of music stars that appeared on The Tonight Show over the 30 years from the very last show on May 22, 1992. For those of us who abhor things like that, the loss of that montage is a major disappointment! I have a feeling that it was cut out for some kind of music licensing reasons...but if it was put in the original, come on!!

For those of you who have never bought any of the other releases, this box set is the bomb-diggity...go for it!

But Respond2 or some other DVD releasing production company (Carson Productions perhaps?) needs to get extremely busy and release more of the gems from the more than 2500 available shows that are sitting on shelves out there somewhere (I'm not counting the 1500 shows from the 60's that are permanently lost). There's a lot of money to be made from the release of much more material (How about starting with the 120+ Carson Comedy Classics that were aired in syndication in the 80's?).

Then try to reach Amazon.com for an explaination and it is like trying to send mail to the Moon.  When you finally do get a reply your original concerns are not addressed.  Instead Amazon trys misdirection to get you off the original problem.  $2.00 is not much money but think of the millions of people who are being overcharged minimum amounts and let it just pass because the hassle to get it straight is monumental.  Amazon you are truly a thief in sheeps clothing.  Never again will I purchase from you.  Those who do you have been warned.",1197936000,2,812,4.544827586206897
2921684,4,B000UFIYQ2,"I was thrilled to see the ""Heeere's Johnny"" DVD collection released on Amazon.com.  I was able to pre-order the set for $69.99 and I received it just one day after the official release date.  My wife and I have been slowly working our way through the collection, one DVD at a time.  Johnny is an icon and legend of late night television.  This collection does a great job of spanning much of Johnny's years of being the Tonight Show host.  However, the picture and sound quality is sometime quite bad.  The overall picture quality is average at best.  I would have thought that the old video would have gone through some sort of restoration process.  Obviously this isn't the case in this collection.  There are some scenes that flicker and have lines running through them, and the sound sometimes becomes garbled.  Another dissapointment is that this collection has no specific order.  There is no way to easily work your way from oldest to newest, or in any other manner.  This collection is actually made up of several other collections.  One of the included collections is made entirely of stand-up commedian guests that appeared on The Tonight Show.  I bought this to watch Johnny, not to see a young Jerry Seinfeld, or the early (and yet still irritating) years of Rosanne Baar.

Overall this is an excellent collection of Johnny Carson's golden years in television.  I just wish it was better organized, had more clips of Johnny himself, and wish the video and audio had gone through some sort of restoration process.  For the money this is definately a good buy, if you are a die hard Carson fan.  =o)",1196553600,107,1609,4.706093189964157
2921685,5,B000UFIYQ2,"Wish this box set existed a year ago when I bought two of the Johnny Carson collections: The Ultimate Collection & Timeless Moments.  For those of you who don't own any Carson yet, you should definitely think about getting Heeere's Johnny. I love the two sets that I already have and I suppose you'd actually be getting a lot more here for less than I paid.  My only complaint is that there's no new material that is never-before-seen in the other collections",1193616000,182,459,4.585365853658536
