5881096,3,B00E00GCF8,IM A huge megadeth fan but this live dvd lacks good drum sound and it sounds like the music is muffled at times like they are playing in a box  or  to loud or distorted there are 3 or 4 songs that sound good  and the screens on stage were ok  GOD BLESS AND JESUS KEEP YOU SAFE ALWAYS,1382659200,,283,3.7457627118644066
5881097,5,B00E00GCF8,"I'll be honest, I always liked Countdown to Extinction but it was never my favorite Megadeth album.  That honor would have to be a toss up between either Rust in Peace or Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?  both of which are Megadeth's speed metal masterpieces.  Although I'm more impressed by the jaw dropping musicianship of the band on those two albums, Countdown really is one of Megadeth's best and more than deserves its own special pillar in the Megadeth catalogue.

Now to put it in perspective, Countdown to Extinction most definitely followed the trend set by Metallica in the early 90s, which was to streamline their sound, lessening the blistering thrash metal assault and aiming for a wider mass appeal by slowing down tempos and adding more melody, songwriting, and grooves to the music.  Now that being said and also admitting that Countdown was a huge change from Rust in Peace, it still sounds like Megadeth.  Even though the technical wizardry is less on CTE, it sounds like a proper evolution of the bands sound.  The tempos may be slowed but the snarling cynicism of Mustaine and post apocalyptic sound crafted by the band still come across well and in some respects even better than previous Megadeth albums because the songwriting is so much more mature on this album.  In other words what I'm saying is that Megadeth may have turned down the intensity with Countdown but they certainly didn't soften their sound.  There's really no ""pop"" songs on this album.  Sweating Bullets and Symphony of Destruction may have great, catchy hooks, but the lyrical content and tone of the music is anything but poppy.

It was that evolution of Megadeth on Countdown that really earned my respect.  Although it was much different than Rust in Peace, the songs were still fantastic and it sounded like a genuine evolution of the band rather than a cheap attempt to sell out.  A true sign of growth and maturity from an often underapreciated band(due to their controversial frontman) that really showed what Megadeth was capable of as musicians.  That kind of seriousness, talent, and professionalism seem all but gone in today's music scene.

So intro aside, how's the DVD?  Great!  5/5!  Sound quality is excellent, set list is terrific and the band are all on top of their game.  It sounds like they play the whole show in E flat or maybe even D (musicians help me out here) probably to compensate for Mustaine's aging voice, but it sounds vicious!  Great to hear underrated songs like Architecture of Aggression, This Was My Life, Psychotron, and Captive Honour played live.  The video set up that goes with each song fits the music perfectly and the band knocks each song out of the park.  A must have for any Megadeth fan!  Now if only they would play Peace Sells in it's entirety...but THAT is another matter!",1382313600,,2819,4.814968814968815
5881098,5,B00E00GCF8,"this songs are fantastics......this concert is historic and the energy of mustain  move the public all the moment
sorry for the basic about the commentary but......viva mustaine!!!",1382140800,3,180,5.666666666666667
5881099,5,B00E00GCF8,"I was skeptical at first with this new live album from the band as I don't particularly like the production on Rust in peace live but this one sounded much better. Certainly there are overdubbed on the vocal but trust me, it's very little and nothing major compare to Big 4 DVD and RIP live DVD.

Instrumental wise there's no denying that Shawn Drover along with Chuck Behler are two weakest drummers on Megadeth but that doesnt mean he couldn't pull it out. For most of part, he just follows what's on the record without adding much fill in like Jimmy De Grasso did on Rude awakening. Chris Broderick is more than capable of pulling any solos note to note and the thing I like about him is that he's not trying to improve or alternate the solos much unlike the previous 2 guitarist Al Pitrelli and Glen Drover. The double Dave has always been spot on when it comes to Guitar and bass playing, just like in any previous live DVD, they just nailed everything perfectly.

I hear some people complaining about the bass being too loud, or vocal is terrible etc etc, and ironically when Megadeth put out DVD that sounded too perfect (Sofia & Blood in the water), these people will claim there are too many studio fix, so either way you can never please anyone especially those who always looking for negative aspect of every release. Just be grateful that the band is still alive and well after freakin 30 years and consistently putting out new record and touring.

5881100,5,B00E00GCF8,"I just bought the CD and DVD and I think its sounded great in general, not as good as the Cow palace show from 1992 but what dya expact? this was 20 years later! It's still awesome to hear live version of Pyschotron, Captive honour and Arhitecture of aggression.

Also, this is the first time Megadeth releasing a DVD without cutting the setlist! (Not counting Big 4 sofia). That one night, London 92, Rude awakening , Fillmore 99, Rust in peace live, all those DVDs doesnt have full setlist of the original show but this time it has the full setlist!",1380672000,5,551,4.455445544554456
5881101,2,B00E00GCF8,"Let me begin this review by saying that I am a huge Megadeth fan and own almost everything they have ever released.  I have also seen them live on the same tour that this video was shot for. Ok, let's get into it. There are no extras or bonus material. It's just the concert. If you purchased this from Best Buy, at least you get the live CD to go with it. Next, the video picture quality and performance was really good, not great. Having such bright video screens behind the players makes it hard to see the actual band members during the performance. This was a huge problem in the actual live show too. The worst part of this, and the part that made it almost unwatchable, was the fact that what you see and what you hear are two different things. What you see is a completely different performance than what you hear. You don't have to watch too closely to notice that when you hear the drummer do something, but what you see is something else... Something is wrong. Now, live, Shawn is not a great drummer, in fact he is downright basic and boring to both watch and to listen to. However, in the studio, he sounds pretty good. Not sure if it's him or he is being told to keep things simple so others can shine. Whatever the case, the audio of his playing sounds pretty good, but watching it is bad. It's not the same at all. The vocal have been overdubbed and I am pretty sure the guitars have been too. My guess is that they recorded the audio ""Live In The Studio"" and placed it over the video. This is actually rather common, just not for each member.  Watch Dave's lips and voice sounds and the distance he is from the mic. It doesn't match. All of this makes this a pretty sloppy release.  Personally I would like to make it so that if the live performance you are seeing or hearing has been tampered with or modified in any way, that package should have a warning label. Hope this helps!",1380326400,18,1898,4.281337047353761
5881102,5,B00E00GCF8,"This goes out to all the folks who have been wrongly saying that these guys lost their sound.  They are even better now with this line up than the Rust in Peace days.  Just completely unbelievable concert.  Made me feel like I was there!  The sound is great, Chris Broderick is a virtuoso, Mustaine's voice is as powerful as it ever was....  Wow... JUST WOW!  Buy this now.",1380067200,7,373,4.411764705882353
5881103,5,B00E00GCF8,"Simply Amazing, the sound is good and the different Mustaine's voice from the CTE CD is makes it different and particular!
I hoped for a better set (maybe Argentina or Brasil would have been better) because the people is not very into the show.

5881130,5,B00E00GCF8,"Great show. I really enjoyed the film image being presented along with the show itself. Mustain and the boyz really tear it up and I also really liked the song selection. I think Shawn Drover kicks serious butt. He is simple but quite accurate and interesting being a lefty playing open handed. Chris Broderick on guitar is probably the best that Mustain might ever end up with for hire. The guy has a master's degree in classical performance. Chris reminds me as far as playing style goes what it was like when I saw Randy Rhoads as he rips through scale patterns with great accuracy and melody not to mention his dexterity. It's powerful and to me better than the original.  This was a good night. I like the setting here better than the Big-4 shows. The dry ice, the song selection, this DVD has very good sound quality too. I cranked it!!  10+",1433548800,3,847,4.4935064935064934

5881152,5,B00E00GCF8,"If you never been to an actual show ( I seen them 10x) ; ) this is as close as you going to get...i have all there concert releases and this one is the best overall. Listen, I don't think there has been a live album in the history of live albums  that hasn't been twerked some kind of way. If thats your issue and your one of them people just watch cell phone youtube footage, cause thats the only way your going to hear ANY concert unaltered. If the record company wants to docter it up for the sake of sounding better let them do there thing and enjoy the end result....hey I like stuff sounding as good as it can, and this by no means feels like it lost anything due to modifications assuming there is any.
Sounds crisp, bands on fire, bass is thumping...if you have a good theater system it will definitely get a nice work out!
If that don't sound like you ....youtubes that way--------->",1390694400,3,892,4.247058823529412

And I love the new guitarist.  He is amazing.  This is a must have in the live dvd and cd collection for my Megadeth.

5881154,5,B00E00GCF8,"This is a good deal if you happen to be at Best Buy and find this there. It's weird that they have the exclusive version that is really cheap compared to how much it is if you got it somewhere else online. If you pay more than $27.99 for it, it's too much. There's no extras on the Blu-Ray, but you do get the audio CD as a bonus. The performance is certainly top notch. There have been some complaints about the bass overpowering the mix, and the tuning being lower than usual. It makes it more interesting especially if you've heard the songs a thousand times. You wouldn't think that a performance of the whole Countdown To Extinction album would be anything above average especially with countless other full album performances that bands have been doing lately, but this has actually proven to be more than average.",1382745600,,820,4.547297297297297
