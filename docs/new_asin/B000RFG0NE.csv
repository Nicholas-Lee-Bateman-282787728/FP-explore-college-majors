8200361,5,B000RFG0NE,"Rick Hernandez, gives a thorough and excellent presentation of Kuntao. The format is done in a way that allows one to learn the material presented. It is well organized. I have a number of DVDs on Kuntao and Silat; and I found some gems in this that I had not found in other DVDs. I was particularly impressed with his adaptation of Bagua circle walking applied to Kuntao. Very cool.",1407456000,,383,4.485714285714286
