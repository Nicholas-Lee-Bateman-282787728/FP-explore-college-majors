6554821,4,B00M3TK98E,"Poor Amakusa, due to a strange curse called ""Absolute Choices"" his life has turned into a great big ""choose your own adventure"" game that has given him a reputation of one of the Reject Five.  But when a choice has Chocolat (a cute girl with cleavage so big it has its own pocket dimension) fall from the sky to assist in the removal of the curse and a phone call from God (well the current God as the one that was supposed to handle Amakusa's case went on maternity leave and dropped the file on his lap) set him on the path of missions that could help him, but if he fails he will be stuck making a fool out of himself for the rest of his life.  Let the games begin.

This was a strange show, and entertaining without being repetitive.  There really is not much character devlopment, but when you see some of the choices he has to go through - it does not really matter, and at the end of the credits there is  small epilogue (based on what would happen if he would have made the OTHER choice) which is hilarious.  Now they did leave a big opening for another season, and I hope they do especially with the fact that the manga is still going.  I watched it on crunchyroll and if you enjoy shows like Excel Saga you will enjoy this.",1410998400,19,1233,4.177215189873418

6554825,5,B00M3TK98E,"Im going to cut right to the chase before getting into details: this anime is great. Its a model series among short anime comedies that delivers on its potential and will keep you laughing from start to finish.

First, the plot: Kanade Amakusa is afflicted with a bizarre curse called Absolute Choice that has turned his life into a visual novel written by a sadist who doesnt believe in happy endings. Out of the blue, two options will pop up in his frame of vision (again, visual novel style), and he must choose one or suffer near-fatal migraines. He gets the same migraines if he tries to explain himself, and the choices are always humiliating. Just to use the first one presented in the show: he sees a battered adult magazine lying on the ground in a park and realizes he must A) kneel down and sniff it deeply in front of a bunch of kids, or B) eat it on the spot.

These cringe-worthy compulsions are ruining his social life and peace of mind, but the universe finally throws Kanade a bone with the arrival of an angel named Chocolat. She was sent to help him cure his curse through a series of missions from God. Unfortunately, Chocolat is a useless ditz with amnesia, and if he screws up even a single mission, Absolute Choice becomes permanent. With alternating help and hindrance from Chocolat, Furano Yukihira (a shy classmate with a split personality whose public persona is a god-tier troll), and Ouka Yuoji (another classmate whos rich and sweet but has a three-year-olds mastery of tact), can Amakusa make it to the final moment of decision?

""My Mental Choices"" (or ""Noucome"" for short) is a harem comedy at heart, but it does several things that raise it above its brethren. First, I love that this series actually has a plot and tells a story. The comedy anime market is glutted with adaptations of four-panel manga that introduce a few wacky characters and then spend 13 episodes showing them doing nothing at all. While theres nothing inherently wrong with that formula, Im a bit sick of it. Kanades high-stakes missions allow ""My Mental Choices"" to mix in genuine excitement and suspense with its humor.

As a matter of originality, its also cool to see a harem comedy where the male lead is the primary source of chaos. Thats normally the ladies job, and while this series has hilarious female weirdos aplenty, it practices equal-opportunity zaniness in a way thats refreshing. I also really appreciated the fact that this series kept its cast proportionate to its small episode count. Many short anime introduce a horde of characters in a short time frame, and the viewer never gets a chance to connect with many (or any) of them before the show ends. ""My Mental Choices"" keeps its attention focused on a few core characters so that we learn to love these freaks, and no character seems unnecessary or neglected.

This anime does have a few weaknesses, most of them minor. With Chocolat being one of the main female leads, the writers could have done more with her charactershe feels like a one-dimensional eating machine at times. The OVA at the end was a little sub-par compared to the rest of the series. Finally, the whole thing is a bit shortonly 10 TV episodes and 1 OVA total. With such a good premise, cast of characters, and plot structure, it could have supported a much longer run. Still, if my biggest complaint was that I wish there were more, thats not a bad problem to have.

Just a heads-up about the product itself: as is usual with Sentai Filmworks standard editions, this is a very bare-bones release. Its subtitled only and has no special features other than the OVA episode and a clean opening and ending. On the plus side, its pretty affordable, and the video and audio quality are good.

In summary, ""My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My High School Romantic Comedy"" is pretty fantastic. Although short, it manages to deliver one of the flat-out funniest stories Ive watched in a long time, with a cast of characters youll like and actually care about when the final credits roll. CHOOSE it!",1436659200,4,4056,4.69620253164557
6554826,5,B00M3TK98E,"The first time I watched this show, I stopped less than 5 minutes in, cringing at the humor. After a few months, I ended up going back to the show, cause even if the first joke was a bit too much too soon for me, I still thought the premise was cool, so I figured I should give this show the same 3 episode grace I give every show. And boy am I glad I did. This show immediately became my go to comedy anime. I will say, I like the stupid humor of this show though. It's comedic range is from sexual (the first episode ends in what might be called the most unnecessarily epic panty shot) to the main character being called anything from a maggot to a pig (actually there's a lot of pig jokes), and some slapstick, main character gets the crap beat out of him, comedy. That range is about the sum total of it. Still, if that works for your comedic tastes, you'll get a kick out of this show. This show also satires a few points in anime, like the unrealistically large breasted character momentarily getting the nickname ""silicon inside"" for guessable reasons. The characters all have even just a single layer deeper of characteristics than typical harem shows making it even more fun. Also, while the show arguably has no ""front-runner"" girl, it is kinda obvious that one is at a severe disadvantage, as one is there only for him summoned by his curse, and another has liked him from before the show started and has no other real relationships, making him the only option she has, while the third is more well liked all around despite being a member of the reject 5 for basically maintaining her childhood innocence and eccentricity into her teenage life. Also, the main character happens to see her in embarrassing situations, which usually means that's the character who's most overlooked, as is a typical trope of the genre, and despite the fun this show pokes at some stereotypes, I don't see it breaking this one. It makes fun of stereotypes, it doesn't break them, not entirely at least. In the end though, I found this show incredibly funny and if you really like the humor of the show and enjoy rewatching comedies, this show is a must buy. I've already re watched it twice in like 2 weeks",1429488000,2,2197,4.467661691542289

8670102,1,B00M3TK98E,"I wanted to watch this anime, it sounded like it would be good fun.  I bought two copies of it, 1st one which was defective and then a 2nd one which was also defective in exactly the same way.  When I tried to play each of them I received a message saying that it could only be played in the USA and in Canada.  I live in the USA and all of my other DVD's and Blue Rays play just fine.  Amazon did give me  refund for the defective video's but I am not inclined to try a third time from amazon.",1506729600,,494,3.803921568627451

8670104,5,B00M3TK98E,probably a harem anime but not really inappropriate for older teens. its redeeming quality is that it is hysterical. the main character is forced to behave pervy time and time again but is not truly a pervert which is probably why he attracts so many girls in the end. the animation is quite good and the voice acting seems okay but it's a little hard to tell as it is only subtitled in English and I don't understand Japanese. a few heartwarming moments but mostly you will laugh and cry (at the same time) for our hero.,1485907200,,521,4.381443298969073
