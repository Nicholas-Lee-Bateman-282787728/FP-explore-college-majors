6368761,5,B00JKEM294,A Fine Step was one excellent movie.  I love watching Luke Perry as an actor and he was great as usual.  This was a great setting and really great family entertainment with clean language.  Recommend it highly.,1404518400,2,210,4.621621621621622

6368764,5,B00JKEM294,Good story line with the most elegant horse-the Paso Fino!,1404172800,4,58,4.9
6368765,4,B00JKEM294,"The story is layered with conflict. There is more to it than the description. 3 families become closely involved as the year moves toward the annual dressage competition.  It was interesting and had a good ending. The horse Fandango was unique, talented and sweet as well.",1404086400,2,272,4.913043478260869
6368766,5,B00JKEM294,"Summer is the season for family movie releases.  Unfortunately over the last several years, there have been few released that the entire family can watch and be entertained.  Yes, there are adult movies and children movies, but few ""family movies,""  appealing to all age groups with different levels.  While it may not challenge the hard-core movie critic, it will move all those who find value in hope and redemption.  And if you happen to be a horse lover or even indie folk music, you'll be well pleased",1403740800,5,506,4.7701149425287355
6368767,2,B00JKEM294,Horses were amazing!  I think I just had different hopes for this movie and wished it didn't have such childish and corny moments.,1403740800,3,130,4.6521739130434785

6368789,4,B00JKEM294,"Thought this was a good movie for a rainy afternoon. Nice to see Oliver Macready acting,handsome family of actors,the Macreadys. Saw nothing to complain about here,but I'm not a horsewoman and never intend to be.",1490659200,,212,5.085714285714285
6368790,5,B00JKEM294,"This is truly a heart warming story. Love over comes all obstacles, human or animal. You have never ridden a horse, until you have ridden a graceful 4 gaiter. Thank you.",1477353600,,169,4.483870967741935

6368793,5,B00JKEM294,Outstanding Movie !! The true pride of the Paso Fino in all of its glory !! With a huge heart as always !!  Okay very upset this DVD is blurry and words on the screen are totally annoying and blurred as well. HORIBLE QUALITY,1466640000,,224,4.090909090909091
6368794,5,B00JKEM294,good family movie,1463616000,,17,5.0
6368795,2,B00JKEM294,Weak plot and poor acting.  Cannot recommend,1442361600,,44,5.285714285714286
6368796,2,B00JKEM294,"As the movie referred to the Paso Fino horse as a work of art, there was little in this movie that presented the true beauty of the Paso Fino horse.  Never in the show world of Paso Finos would a rider gallop his Paso Fino.  Paso Fino horses are deliberately prevented from galloping cantering to learn to execute a four beat gate.  It was crucifying to watch all of the horses featured galloping out of the barns and off into the sunset.  Finally, the star trainer was portrayed as being financial rewarded to win the ""World Cup"".  There is no compensation to a rider who wins a Paso Fino world cup competition. And more importantly, there is no ""one winner"" at a Paso Fino World Cup, there are many different classes of competition with multiple winners.  There is celebrity for those who win their classes with maybe training opportunities, but the movie implied there is great financial prize for winning.  There is none.  It was also painful to see the heroine trainer yanking at the poor horse's lead line as a method of training...This move is hysterical to watch if you are a Paso Fino fan.  This movie should be called, ""Galloping Paso Finos"".",1438819200,3,1152,4.607843137254902
6368797,2,B00JKEM294,It was a cute movie but the plot line was weak and the horsemanship in the movie was so unrealistic that I honestly wouldn't want a child to watch it for fear that they think what the characters were doing was acceptable.  This was quite a disappointment for me.,1436486400,,262,4.346938775510204

6368827,4,B00JKEM294,"the movie was quite long, i watched for 1 hour, then I forgot that the rental was just 24 h and couldn't finish it. Luke Perry is a great actor, mostly all the cast was great but some characters were unbelievable...the little girl...",1410652800,,233,4.441860465116279

6368839,2,B00JKEM294,"The background music didn't go with the movie. I expected a better movie with Luke Perry, but was disappointed. The young girl getting so attached to the Luke Perry character so early in the movie didn't seem right. I guess you have to watch the movie yourself, and you be the judge.",1408752000,,283,4.461538461538462

6368844,1,B00JKEM294,Almost stopped watching it because it was hard to follow with very choppy editing. Yes the horses were pretty but so unrealistic. Nobody leaves horses tied in stalls all the time. It is inferred in the beginning that neither her or her dad ride yet they both seem to know how to perfectly tack up a somewhat complicated setup and then ride beautifully especially when Claire rides Fandango who hasn't been ridden since his accident. Even the 9 year old horse crazy girl I watched it with pointed out these issues.,1406937600,,513,4.648351648351649
6368845,1,B00JKEM294,"Absolutely ridiculous circumstances and improbable plot.  Poorly and overacted by the entire cast.  The horses were tied overnight in the stalls and on such long ropes that they could become tangled, the 13yr old has never ridden and hops on to gallop down a concrete barn aisle!  Really?  Horses will slip and fall on concrete.  Then she "" sets this stallion free"" with a rope dragging.  The ridiculous situations go on and on.  Not even good entertainment.  Complete waste of time.",1406937600,2,483,4.8765432098765435

8651738,2,B00JKEM294,I would have preferred something with a more compelling story and character growth. There were many holes and a real thirteen year old actor would have made Claire more believable. It's obvious that this girl is between 16-20 years old. The story line could have been improved and I honestly skipped through a lot of it. A good attempt but not that good.,1524441600,,354,4.634920634920635

Still, I liked Claire and Fandango enough to rate it a 4. A sensitive teenager and a superb horse--Fandango. I would watch this movie again..",1506470400,,290,4.596153846153846

8651745,3,B00JKEM294,"I deleted my initial review, which I wrote about 1/3 of the way in, but having watched the whole thing now, it deserves at least three stars.  Throughout the entire movie, I went from not liking it, to thinking it was okay.  I cant put my finger on it.  There will be good acting followed by something that feels like it was the first read of a script.  Bad background music followed by a great song or two.  Even the opening credits were irritating, flashing on and off, which is kind of how the movie played out for me.  Worth a watch if you like these actors and horses.  But you'll have to stick it out through some rough patches.",1506038400,,634,4.233333333333333
8651746,1,B00JKEM294,"I get it; not all movies are big budget.  I had no problems with the acting and the overall idea seemed worthwhile.  But story line is full of holes.  The main actress did just fine, but the lines she was given---not so good.  One moment she was a bratty teen and another a jedi-master full of wisdom.
 It was weird.  (Yes, teens and people in general can be like that, but if you watch the show, you'll know what I mean).  What got me most, however, was the MUSIC and how, at different times, the movie tried to force comedy into the movie.  It was really, really awkward.  Sorry--I really wanted to like this one.",1505865600,3,615,4.278260869565218
