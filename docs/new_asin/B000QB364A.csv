8195289,5,B000QB364A,Great DVD! Fast shipping too. Thank you very much!,1416960000,,50,4.666666666666667
8195290,5,B000QB364A,"I am currently studying for the ACE Personal Trainer exam and this DVD, which came with the ACE Premier package, was well worth the price!

Sabrena Newton does a great job of explaining the muscles, their origins and insertions, how and why they function as they do. She also demonstrates various exercises to show how to engage and therefore strengthen each muscle discussed.

Having this program is like having a personal instructor for this material. I have been a teacher myself for the past 26 years and one of the most important things is to be organized, concise and to be able to demonstrate material in a way that is meaningful.

Sabrena Newton accomplishes all of those things in this program and it really helps make this extremely complex material much easier to understand and apply!

The DVD is very well chaptered so you can easily access specific muscles without having to forward through the program.

While this DVD can certainly stand on it's own, I highly recommend also using ""The Fitness Professional's Guide To Musculoskeletal Fitness"" by  Lawrence A. Golding and Scott M. Golding in conjunction with it. This book came with my ACE package and is also recommended on the DVD.

There are some typo's in the book (which I have been told they will correct in future editions when I contacted the publisher), but overall it's an excellent resource which has an incredible CD ROM showing individual details of muscles and ""video"" footage of various types of movements as well as a large amount of exercises.

Along with the footage, there is a list of all the muscles involved in the particular exercise. You have the option of clicking on the names of those muscles which then leads you to a page with detailed illustrations (with various viewing options including seeing only the origins/insertions) and explanations of the functions of the muscles.

I feel that the DVD plus that book/CD ROM are both important tools which are helping me really prepare for the ACE exam and I'm grateful to have them available!

 HIGHLY recommended!",1198454400,10,2053,4.887608069164265

I can highly recommend this and I feel so much more confident and prepared for the upcoming exam.",1197504000,8,315,4.448275862068965
