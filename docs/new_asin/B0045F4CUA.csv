4262769,5,B0045F4CUA,"This DVD really does deliver a total-body work out in 20 minutes. I particularly like the clear instruction, easy to follow format and the fact that it's good for both beginners and more ""veteran"" exercisers. Most of the individual exercises combine upper and lower body work, which means you can get twice as much done in half the time. And, unlike many other kettle bell exercise DVDs, Mr. Vilensky explains proper form and alignment when using the kettle bell.

I've been doing this DVD before work in the morning and find that I have more energy to get through my day. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quick work-out that is both fun and highly effective. I only hope that Mr. Vilensky makes more DVDs!",1289606400,11,725,4.62015503875969
4262770,5,B0045F4CUA,"I can attest that this is a safe and sure way to maintain both weight and physical fitness. The series of exercises addresses both aerobic and strength elements.  This is a great program for general, overall conditioning for people of all ages.",1289347200,2,244,4.809523809523809
4262771,5,B0045F4CUA,"This is a great workout - easily adaptable for the beginner or those who follow a regular fitness routine.  The exercises are easy to follow and the workout keeps you moving and motivated.  This DVD makes a wonderful foundation for an exercise program, or can add variety to an existing workout routine.",1289260800,2,303,4.8076923076923075
4262772,5,B0045F4CUA,"In 20 minutes you get a complete body workout. You can't get a better workout DVD anywhere. If we all did this workout once a day, every day, we would be in the best condition of our lives. I recommend you to buy this DVD.",1289260800,4,222,3.9555555555555557
4262773,5,B0045F4CUA,Great work out.  Good for those just starting out and fitness buffs. It really keeps you moving.,1288915200,,96,4.647058823529412
4262774,5,B0045F4CUA,"Professional trainers can be costly, but workout routines are difficult to perform if you aren't familiar with basic anatomy, physiology, exercise physiology. On this tape there are numerous workout routines, and great recipes to guide you in getting fit.",1288656000,5,255,5.564102564102564

4262776,4,B0045F4CUA,"Hey this DVD is a good work-out. It's no frills and the instructor is boring,but the work-out is good.
I was very sore after the first day...it's only 20 minutes!",1325289600,2,162,4.433333333333334
4262777,2,B0045F4CUA,The DVD case arrived cracked in several places and the content is about as creative as a box of crayons.  I found the exercises easy to understand and duplicate but more attention should have been paid to the quality of the production set-up.  It looks like it costs about $50.00 to make this video.,1325203200,,299,4.518518518518518
4262778,4,B0045F4CUA,"This is a great workout that covers some basic exercises. DO NOT buy this if you want high production quality and bubbly personalities. The instructor, Vadim almost seems like he's falling asleep in it. I actually like that sort of no-nonsense-no-BS approach but some people may require a more energetic instructor to motivate them. This is a very vigorous workout. I actually had difficulty keeping pace the first few times. You'll need 1 Kettlebell and 2 Dumbbells and a mat for the end ab circuit.",1325203200,2,500,4.894117647058824
4262779,3,B0045F4CUA,"The actual workout contained in the DVD is pretty good.  But there is no polish on it.  The trainer tells these two women what to do, and they count.  They don't even wear workout clothes.  The lighting is bad.
Anyway, the workout is good and if you can ignore all the other stuff, then buy it.",1323043200,2,294,4.196428571428571
4262780,4,B0045F4CUA,"""20 Minute Fitness Bootcamp"" is a short, beginning to intermediate, and somewhat easy bootcamp. (I did use light weights.) Vadim Villensky leads Cindy and Debbie through a mostly basic kettlebell and dumbbell program.  All moves are slow, controlled and moderately paced.

A pair of dumbbells are needed.  You also need one kettlebell.  If you don't have a kettlebell, one may use a dumbbell.

Here's the breakdown.

Warm up (under 2 minutes)
Kettlebell work (under 10 minutes)
Dumbbell work (about 8 and half minutes)
Core work (under 5 minutes)",1318204800,17,546,5.1477272727272725
4262781,3,B0045F4CUA,"I am surprised this DVD received so many high reviews...that's why I bought it.  The DVD is effective (I was very sore after the first couple of times)but it is boring!  It looks like a homemade video of two women working out in the gym with their personal trainer.  Also it has lots of lunges and up and down work from the floor to standing which is hard on the knees.  I will use it when i want a short effective work out, not because I am not excited about the DVD...very little interaction from the trainer or participants towards the audience..just ok not great.",1317772800,4,567,4.371428571428571
4262782,5,B0045F4CUA,"This DVD provides a simple and effective routine for anyone.  It is simple to follow, provides a clear demonstration of each exercise, including a simplified form for beginners.  All one needs is a kettle bell, a pair of dumb bells and six square feet of floor area.  Regular use will quickly increase strength and improve balance.",1310688000,,331,4.875
4262783,5,B0045F4CUA,"This video is great for strength training and ends up being good cardio by the end of it.  You can make it as tough as you want by adjusting the weight of the kettlebells you use.  I put on my own music and after 20 minutes all my ""trouble spots"" have been targeted through exercises that combine different muscle groups. This one is a keeper in my at-home workout collection.",1306713600,9,376,4.357142857142857
4262784,5,B0045F4CUA,"Real people in a real workout -- unlike other videos, this one instructs rather than intimidates. This is an exercise video for people who would normally shun them. Great workout!",1306713600,6,179,5.0
4262785,5,B0045F4CUA,"Easy to follow, well paced. This workout brings real results with building strength and core fitness.  Good cardio too!",1303948800,3,119,5.2631578947368425
4262786,5,B0045F4CUA,"Just the facts: I began this workout weighing 219lbs. After using it religiously I got down to 167lbs.  Fast Forward: I went away for some time, put on some extra weight,(over 40 pounds), took the video back out, and in just 3 months I am at 182lbs. Take my word for it, this workout produces exactly what you want...FAST!",1300924800,12,322,4.4576271186440675
4262787,5,B0045F4CUA,"I find it really hard to start and then make a commitment to a fitness routine.  When I bought ""Fitness Bootcamp"" (not from Amazon) I had very modest hopes.  But it was a ""Mikey likes it"" moment -- I was immediately able do it (the beginners' end of the spectrum), I didn't have to leave home, I felt pretty good afterwards and have continued do it every other day.  I'm on my 3rd month, feel stronger and fitter, and have added a session with a personal trainer and yoga to my regime.  A complete victory!  Give it a try.",1300492800,8,522,4.232323232323233
4262788,5,B0045F4CUA,"The 20 Minute Fitness Bootcamp, by trainer Vadim Vilensky is great!  I am finally using those dumbells....No more guilt!
It is demanding, yet easy to follow, and best of all, I actually DO the workout! That's what I like about it...it is doable.
Vadim Vilensky gives clear directions on how to use the weights safely.  I feel like I have really done a good thing for myself when I have finished this bootcamp tape. You have a great trainer right there for you!  I  love this bootcamp tape!",1296345600,3,489,4.5227272727272725

4262790,5,B0045F4CUA,"Very professional work out.  Gives one a thorough work out.  It's nicely organized so that beginners can focus on a few sections, at first, and as they gain strength and confidence play all sections.",1293408000,2,199,4.823529411764706
4262791,5,B0045F4CUA,This is the best workout video I have found.  The workout is not complex but works many muscles in the body for total fitness.  Twenty minutes to do the routine is very easy to fit into a busy day.  I highly recommend this to any one who wants a full exercise routine that can be done in their own home.  It is also an extremely great value!,1292544000,,341,4.044776119402985
4262792,5,B0045F4CUA,"This is a great workout for anyone just starting an exercise program to atheletes.  You can do this at your own pace with varied weight size to customize to your ability.  The instructions are easily understandable and it only takes 20 minutes per day for a great full body workout!

4262794,5,B0045F4CUA,"I attend Vadim's Saturday Morning Boot Camp on a regular basis with a group of friends.  This DVD is an EXCELLENT representation of the exercises we do and have wanted on DVD for working out at home.  Thanks Vadim!
I am doing the 20 minute workout 3 or 4 mornings a week for over 2 weeks now and it's making a tremendous difference already.  It's so easy to follow along.  When I really want to push myself, I do it twice.  I'm finding that I'm not as sore after our Saturday Morning Boot Camp and that I'm going at it harder than ever.

This DVD is going to make a great Christmas gift for a couple of people I know!",1290470400,,617,4.1
4262795,5,B0045F4CUA,"I started the first time in my life the workout with this DVD. I didn't imagine it is

8416629,5,B0045F4CUA,"Holy moly...just finished my first workout, kicked my butt.  I'm out of shape but still an active guy.  For beginners I would suggest 15 lb kettle ball and 10 lb dumbells.",1420416000,,171,4.483870967741935

8416633,5,B0045F4CUA,"For those who would like to get in a great overall workout in a short period of time, this fits the bill.  Who cares if it's not professionally done as other reviewers have criticized. The content is what counts and trust me, this guy knows his stuff.

This workout addresses all areas of the body and I love it!  I combine it with yoga 1-2 times/week and walking daily.  Nice tape for changing it up once in awhile.",1354147200,,416,4.294871794871795
8416634,4,B0045F4CUA,"I just received this DVD, and have worked out with it three times so far.  Sore?  Yes!  Energized?  Yes!  About myself, I am definitely over weight, and almost 50.  I do not exercise, and sit at a desk all day.  I cannot do all of the moves they do on this, but I replace where necessary, and will eventually work up to being able to do the entire workout the way it's supposed to be done.  I love the instructions, and really like that it's only 20 minutes.  I get quite the workout with this tape, and enjoy the reality of it, instead of a workout video where it's got people with muscles on their muscles, and constant hammering at you to get it done.",1348704000,2,654,4.168
8416635,5,B0045F4CUA,I feel like I am right there with them in class. Very easy to understand. Great workout for strength and toning. It is just enough. Great option to have.,1348444800,,153,4.310344827586207
8416636,5,B0045F4CUA,I have been looking for a good workout DVD for some time now and this is it! It was a great way to keep up my fitness and was just like having my own personal trainer there with me. Vadim does a great job because you actually see results due to the variations in workout pattern. He is highly knowledgeable about physiology and thus is able to craft the workout such that you receive the maximum benefit. A must buy for working out!,1345766400,,432,4.216867469879518
