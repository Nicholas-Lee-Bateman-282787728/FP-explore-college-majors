8585345,1,B00CROA55M,"the worst movie on amazon. don't buy

this can't be considered real animation. it's like a comic book, except the voice acting quality is terrible. the animation is almost just a single frame with very short movement, and so you might as well be looking at pictures.",1450569600,,266,4.659574468085107
8585346,1,B00CROA55M,Dialogue sounds like it's in a tin can. And it's hard to understand. Then it gets worse.  Subtitles you can't read.,1429056000,,115,4.476190476190476
8585347,1,B00CROA55M,"This was abysmal. I didn't expect much by way of animation when I ordered it. So when I didn't get it, I wasn't terribly surprised. I was more concerned with how well they were able to capture the Inferno, but they missed that mark as well.
It started well. They start with a great couple of lines about Dante himself which was encouraging. The first few lines were translated in a unique way that made me have hope that the people who put it together knew what they were doing, but that was short lived.
The way in which they envisioned the funnel of hell was far far too narrow.  The dialog between Dante and Francesca was poorly done. There were also times where the way in which they edited the dialog made no sense. When Dante meets Virgil, right away Dante says you must be Virgil, but they totally bypassed where Virgil mentions that he was a Manutan.

It was poorly edited. They also left out significant events. Dante does not speak to Feranta which is a key dialog. In fact, the key characteristic of the Divine Comedy is that Dante interacts with the people. There is none of that in this mess of a film. It was only 38 minutes, so they had plenty of time to include many of the important events that were left out.

There are more things wrong with this than there are right. You are better off just watching the old silent film version.",1410912000,,1349,4.366533864541832

Outstanding in every way...A film journey into Inferno well worth taking!
Bravo,  an amazing achievement!",1368662400,3,204,5.181818181818182
8585349,5,B00CROA55M,"This film is very impressive.  I really liked it a lot. The artwork was fantastic, and
the music and story-telling were mesmerizing.  It shows a great deal of effort went into it.
This takes you through the levels of hell in a way that you really feel the atmosphere.
By the end you gasp for air with Dante.  A must for poets, artists, musicians, vampires, anyone.",1368662400,4,364,4.484848484848484
