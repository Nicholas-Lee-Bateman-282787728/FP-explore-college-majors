2245921,5,B0007VY54O,"I truly love Lifetime type movies; never heard of this case, but watching it definitely lead me to researching the case.

Will recommend this movie to others.",1279324800,,158,4.851851851851852
2245922,5,B0007VY54O,This is an excellent movie and is a true accounting of the abuse that women and men go through during relationships,1260230400,,115,4.523809523809524
2245923,3,B0007VY54O,"Well first of all I feel everything in this movie happened too fast. First, she meets him at a dance, she declines his offer to have a dance with him. Yet, she goes on a date with him when he just pops up at her house. Next thing you know he's climbing through his bedroom window to have sex with her. She says no, but then stops refusing and sits there intrigued by his pretty eyes and his nice body as he undresses and climbs on top of her. Her macho dad finds him suspicious and her push over mom thinks they're in ""love"" and they get married. THEN the next scene she's having his baby and he beats her that same day. From then on after that it's a long resolution with Katie going on and on about how much she loved him. C'mon she was 18 right out of highschool he was probably her first real boyfriend. And he saw her as an easy catch with her innocence and naivety. She was so into her loser hubby that she couldn't see that nice cop Ed had a thing for her. I would have liked to see more of their relationship prior to things going south and more build up hinting towards his rage besides just hearing Katie's dad's suspicions. Also, we see Katie's bruises, but we don't see all that much of their many confrontations

Also I know it's typical with abuse victims but why didn't she say why she did it during the arrest??  It was so frustrating how she covered up for him and all she did was talk about how much she loved him. She couldn't have been much older than her early 20's. When Jimmy went to bed after pointing the gun to her face, she should've grabbed their kid and went to her house and told her dad who was a cop.  And why didn't her sister testify that she didn't tell because Katie was so distressed she was going to kill herself? That would've helped since the lawyer made making it seem like her sister kept quiet out of ignorance.

Her dad also demeaned her mother and this is brought to the family's attention. I love Kellie Martin but her character in this movie was too naive and foolish, she was clearly using the judgement of a girl still in high school when she married this guy and covered up for him afraid to tell daddy because he wouldn't love her. (her dad might have been in denial at first being that he feels if he isn't aware of a problem it doesn't exist,but there were bruises to prove she was truthful, and he already disliked  Jimmy)Katie took things way too fast. She even looked like a little girl for God's sake when she had a child and one on the way.  And the way the neighbor stood by and looked on was ridiculous. The attempt to portray her as heartbroken and madly in love also shows she's too  young and naive to be in a marriage. I'm 17 and I wouldn't think I'm in love after one date, or let a guy have sex with me on the first date, let alone marry him shortly after highschool when I didn't even want to dance with him...let me just stop right here.",1248739200,10,2905,4.176785714285714
2245924,3,B0007VY54O,"I think this movie shows just how long a person can go before they just snap and hurt someone. This girl was abused so much and became so afraid to tell anyonne about it. It you ever have someone in your life that you think may be getting abused by thier spouse, do somethin, ANYTHING to help them get out of that situation. It could save their life",1243123200,10,349,4.147058823529412
2245925,3,B0007VY54O,"I didn't really care for this movie.  Although the story was a powerful one the mediocre acting didn't do it any justice.  I had to watch it 3 times because I kept falling asleep.

I even found myself dozing at the parts that were supposed to be action filled.",1236902400,,260,4.26530612244898
2245926,5,B0007VY54O,"After enjoying watching Kellie Martin on Life Goes On, it was interesting to see her in movies shown on Lifetime. In this one, she is a young wife married to a husband who slowly entangles her in a life of abuse with no end in sight. It was rough seeing how he treated her when she came home from the hospital after giving birth to their child, expecting her to handle the baby and luggage and hitting her when she asked for his help. The movie also helps us understand her wanting to keep it a secret by watching how her father treats his wife, as though she had no intelligence or anything to say that was important enough for him to listen to. Katie saw this as she was growing up, and left her vulnerable to her sadistic husband. In the end, she confronts her father and makes him see how he has been treating his wife, and we hope in the future he begins to change his attitude, and start looking on her as his wife and partner, rather than a dummy. I taped this off Lifetime, and look forward to getting it on DVD now that it has been released on that format. And just to let those reading this know I know not all victims are women, I also enjoyed Men Don't Tell, a movie about a husband dealing with an abusive wife. Abuse to any spouse no matter which gender is a tragedy.",1235952000,8,1281,4.169354838709677

2245930,4,B0007VY54O,"I remember seeing this on tv about 10 years ago. It was well written and Kellie Martin was perfect for the role of the people pleasing young girl.  It was based on a true story of a girl who marries young and winds up being physically and verbally abused by her spouse.  It is a very violent movie. I don't think anyone under 13 should watch it, but it is so realistic.  Abuse can happen to anyone, even a policeman's daughter.  The way to help prevent abuse is to realize that it can happen to anyone and to pay attention to the warning signs.  I think parents should watch this movie with their kids once they start dating. My thanks to Kellie Martin who is so passionate about doing movies that are able to impact lives for the better.  I am glad she is so wise and caring, she really has made a difference in my life.
P.S. For Kellie Martin fans...I just found out that Life Goes On will be released on dvd in the summer of 2006!  It's about time!!!!!! I hope they will eventually release all four seasons of LGO, the most wonderful tv show ever.",1122681600,40,1050,4.2462311557788945

2245934,3,B0007VY54O,"Unfortunately, I had seen it on TV before at midday a few years prior, so that made it a disappointment for me, but for anyone who hadn't seen it would probably enjoy it.  As it's based on a true story, make it a worthwhile movie.",1372896000,,230,4.111111111111111

8052380,5,B0007VY54O,"I love how this movie shows the affects of BOTH physical and verbal abuse.  I watched this movie solely because of actress Kellie Martin as I love watching her from the short-lived TV series ""Christy"" in which she plays the title character.  I wanted to see if Kellie is just as good in her acting in another role and she definitely did not disappoint in this film which states it's based off of a true story.  Kellie Martin plays Katie who is a young woman fresh out of high school who happens to bump into a handsome and somewhat older younger man at a party of her father's, who works in law enforcement.  (The entire beginning of the movie Kellie Martin even has her long ""Christy"" hairdo and then cuts it short after she marries.)  Katie is shown to endure both physical and verbal abuse as soon as her first child, a son, is born, and she keeps her abuse hidden from her family until things become too out of hand and in order to protect herself she ends up shooting and killing her husband.  I love how they show how clueless her father was about all of this and then realizes after being confronted by Katie that he himself can be somewhat verbally abusive to her mother and apologizes.  All in all this is an EXCELLENT movie well-worth viewing.  I won't give away the outcome of Katie's court trial towards the end when her father has to get her a lawyer.",1423526400,,1364,4.384920634920635

8052382,5,B0007VY54O,"Kellie Martin, the voice of Roxanne from A Goofy Movie/Mona from the Christmas Maximus segment of Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas who has always excelled at playing kind, naive and gentle characters, does a great job as always. Kristin Dattilo is the big sister every girl should have while Linda Kelsey gives the right amount of balance as the caring mother who is having problems with her husband who is Kellie Martin's father played by Kevin Dobson who is too busy to realize the dangerous situation his daughter is in until the attorney informs him of her husband (Ivan Sergei)'s abusive tendencies after she shoots him dead in self defense when he beat her severely when she tried to dissolve their marriage. When she said that he would have hit her too many times and then killed her in the end, that's what can happen to you or someone you know is being abused if action is not taken. If I were the judge in this movie and when the jury found Katie (Kellie Martin) not guilty of Jimmy (Ivan Sergei)'s murder and before Jimmy's parents (James Harper and Jennifer Griffin) apologized to her, I would have admonished those who witnessed Katie's abuse (i.e. her mother (Linda Kelsey), sister (Kristin Dattilo) and neighbor (Ted Hayden)) for not reporting it to the police and reminded them that we have a responsibility to the people that we care about: When you see them hurting or you see them in trouble, you step in and you TELL someone so that this does not happen again.",1408233600,,1479,4.648854961832061
