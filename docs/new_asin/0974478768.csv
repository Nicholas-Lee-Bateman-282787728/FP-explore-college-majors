7794584,5,0974478768,"Raised in a very different legalistic Christian home, this film made me cry often as the World Wide Church of God rooted out the legalism at it's roots and found the true grace of God. Very uplifting indeed!",1502496000,,207,4.473684210526316
7794585,4,0974478768,"I purchased this movie when I was studying the Armstrong movement. I really enjoyed reading a lot of his material even though I myself am not agreement with his interpretation of the bible. It was very interesting to watch how his church went from a Sabbath keeping,non-trinitarian church that taught the racist views of British Israelism to an Evangelical Christian Church. Even for a non-Christian like myself I found it very interesting and even a little moving. Its not everyday you see a religious ""cult"" make a complete turn around.",1391212800,,538,4.988888888888889
7794586,1,0974478768,"in the end, I think this is a DVD attempting to justify a ministries ""mainstream"" belief system over the blatant lies of the Mormon Church. In the end, both these ""religions"" leave you in the ditch. Sorry, but mainstream Christianity is just as fraught with lies and fables as is the Mormon one. Either way, save your money....unless you're brainwashed, and wish to justify your position at the expense of your salvation.",1388966400,,421,4.861111111111111
7794587,1,0974478768,"As an ex-member of the Worldwide Church of God cult (who changed their name to Grace Communion International in 2009), I would have to say that the only ""miracle"" that came out of WCG's ""transformation"" is the fact that thousands of other members such as myself, were freed from the stronghold of the cult, and have wanted nothing to do with that denomination ever since! For a more accurate assessment of WCG's transformation story, see the ""Exit & Support"" Website (google it).",1320710400,,479,4.853658536585366
7794588,3,0974478768,"Just watched this DVD recently and I'll have to offer a review of mixed ratings. In terms of production value, this video is poorly edited, poorly shot, poorly boarded, poorly mastered and just generally low-quality throughout. Not that this is or needs to be compared with some high-tech action film or anything, but I did want to make note of the terrible production. It makes sitting through the entire video rather tedious and irritating - much more could have been done with this for no additional costs. I've seen high school students turn out presentations of better quality.

That aside, this is a nice, summarizing overview of the Worldwide Church of God's dramatic doctrinal shift, told largely by the leadership figures that presided over it or served in the organization at the time, and a few assistants and members as well. It's not particularly in-depth, analytical or examinative - if you're looking for real information on the topic there's not much to be found here, it's clearly intended for an audience not familiar with the events. (This is where the poor production misses the mark - it's not really attention-grabbing to the unaware/previously disinterested audience they're attempting to reach.)

It certainly isn't likely to bring disaffected former members back to the fold, as one interviewee (a Dr. Michael Feazell) insults former WCG members directly by claiming ""those who have left did not let the Bible speak to them... they clung to their proof-texts and Herbert W. Armstrong"". Within the context of a presentation that patters on and on about how gut-wrenchingly difficult a process it was for WCG members mentally, this is a completely illogical statement, paying lip service to the ""hardship"" but not actually granting its effect on others who may have returned after deliberation or gone elsewhere in the Body of Christ since the doctrinal changes were announced.

However, aside from providing a relatively good summary of the events, the presentation also gives some insight into the *impetus* for the doctrinal change post-Armstrong, explaining lightly why the Worldwide Church of God's leadership came to the realization of need for change and some degree of the thought processes involved, which is probably the aspect that gives the video the most value. Some of the interviewee's comments are more valuable than others, but at least there's some range of commentary as opposed to different faces all saying the same things. So I'll go out on a limb and grant it 3 stars instead of the initial 2 I was intending.",1233619200,4,2555,5.078571428571428
