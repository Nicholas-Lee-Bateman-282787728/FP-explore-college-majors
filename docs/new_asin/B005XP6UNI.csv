When it was over, went home and ordered two copies; one for myself and one as a gift for a close friend who also enjoys Big Band and swing dancing.  The ""Extras"" tracks are as good as the main show!",1400630400,8,279,4.148148148148148
4903888,4,B005XP6UNI,"Grew up with Mr. Welk. My Mother remembered dancing in the streets of New York during WWII listening to Harry James. I recall her playing Glen Miller 45 records while growing up. As the years went on Welk became it on T.V. for big bands. He had great musicians, the best. His entertainers were also great, but I loved Johnny Zale, Bob Havens and all the wonderful talent. If you like the Big Band sound buy this. No one asking for money every few minutes.",1398729600,11,455,4.364705882352941

JON HARWOOD",1473033600,,43,3.888888888888889
8488843,3,B005XP6UNI,"This is mostly instrumental with only about 4 songs having the singers from the show singing.  The tunes are good choices, You Made me Love you, Sentimental Journey, Begin the Beguine...there is commentary between each song which might make it less well flowing to seniors in nursing homes which was what I wanted it for.  The familiar sight of Lawrence Welk and his musicians and singers should spark some memories though.",1469059200,4,423,4.943661971830986

Harry enjoyed this very much and raved about it as he recalled his dancing days in various canteens and the big band era.,1468368000,,301,3.918032786885246
