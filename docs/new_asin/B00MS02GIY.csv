6600675,5,B00MS02GIY,"Great movies! I highly recommend them if you're a science fiction type of person. I am a huge fan of the Aliens franchise, Predators franchise and AVP franchise.",1426377600,,161,4.785714285714286
6600676,5,B00MS02GIY,been watching them... love it !,1425340800,,31,4.333333333333333
6600677,4,B00MS02GIY,"I had not seen AVP Requiem before this purchase. It is not one of my favorites of the group ( Alien(s) movies, AVP(s), Predator, Prometheus ). I do, however, like the first AVP, so could not go wrong with both movies for this low price. Good buy, and adds to my collection. I have every one of the above mentioned movies now.",1424217600,4,325,4.258064516129032
6600678,3,B00MS02GIY,"Only 3 stars because this double feature is half good. ""Alien vs. Predator"" is a great, ""on the edge"" feature! You get to learn more about The Predator's way of life and actually gain support for them. ""Aliens Requiem"" is horrible. The quality is fabulous with both features.
""Prometheus"", the first of what has been rumored to be the first of the prequels is more along the lines of the early Alien films.",1423526400,5,406,4.575342465753424
6600679,3,B00MS02GIY,"Being a fan of the Original Alien Tetrology & the Predator Trilogy (and the Prometheous), I thought when they did these two that it was about time they did the Alien Vs Predator crossover.  I was Seriously, and mean SERIOUSLY, wrong!!!!  Both of these movies suffer from being what either original series should not have been.  And that is a seriously bad set of films that rely on just the premise of the Alien & the Predator fighting each other.  Both movies suffer from lack of plot & good scriptwriting.
  It's a shame that what should have been one of the better crossover movies were failures.  While it is nice to see them as crossovers, it would be nice if they could do both series credit when they do the next crossover of Alien Vs Predator",1421884800,5,750,4.470588235294118
6600680,2,B00MS02GIY,"I was hoping, since this version was released more recently, that they would have corrected the overly dark encoding on Aliens vs Predator: Requiem.  Unfortunately, they did not.  This was not just an ""artistic"" choice.  The actual encoding looks like it was done at the wrong black levels.  This is not how the movie looked in theaters, nor is it how it looked in trailers.

The transfer for Aliens vs Predator is much better.  Certainly not the best Blu Ray ever, and there is too much film grain, but it's at least watchable without adjusting your TV.

Apart from the video quality issues, these movies are decidedly ""okay"".  Neither of the movies are the best in either the Alien or Predator franchises.  Not by a mile.  But they do provide some interesting additions to the Alien and Predator lore that fans of the series will be interested in.  Whether it's canon or not is debatable... Regardless, it's guilty pleasure to see Aliens on Earth making short work out of unsuspecting humans and having ridiculous fights with Predators.

Special feature wise, they're pretty bare bones.  I didn't expect much from the ""double feature""  packaging.  And not much is exactly what I got.  Both discs include both the standard theatrical release along with an ""unrated"" cut.  There's a feature that, when enabled, is supposed to show an icon during the bonus footage scenes.  Unfortunately, the icon is ALWAYS present on screen, meaning it's something you're not going to want to use.  Both discs include trailers and maybe a commentary or two, and that's about it.  Nothing like what's on the Alien Anthology.

Strangely, the AVP:R disc is labeled ""Disc 1"" as if they literally took Disc 1 out of a AVP:R two disc special edition, and just put it in a box with AVP.

Inexplicably, the AVP:R disc also contains 2 trailers (for Jumper and Hitman) that play by default before the main menu.  I bought these discs, please don't force me to watch trailers!

Overall, I'd give the AVP disc 3 stars and the AVP:R disc 1 star, mostly because of its technical shortcomings and sloppy packaging.  Only diehard fans of the Alien (or Predator) series should pick these up.  At least until there is a fix for the AVP:R disc.",1414368000,39,2209,4.747368421052632

6600683,3,B00MS02GIY,"I actually enjoyed ""Alien vs. Predator"".  It doesn't stand up to the actual franchise movies, but it a fun way to ""kill"" an evening.

However, the 2nd movie ""Requiem"" was not as good.",1520294400,,183,4.515151515151516

6600693,4,B00MS02GIY,"The 4 star movie has nothing to do with the content of either film. I had previously seen both as a fan of the Alien franchise and while I do prefer the Alien and Predator in their respective titles more than in a crossover spinoff, these were still entertaining to watch. That said, the only reason this doesnt get 5 stars is because the disc transfer for AVP: Requiem is entirely too dark!! And its not a matter of adjusting your TVs color settings. The picture itself, the film is so dark at times that you cant see anything. I found myself having to turn off all the lights in the living room and still really having to concentrate in order to try and catch what was happening onscreen, sometimes to no avail. Dunno if there is a better transfer out there or not, but this one is so dark, its hard to really wanna watch it again. AVP is perfectly fine though!",1506988800,,863,4.300613496932515

I actually waited at first till both films were out before purchasing them, but as time went by Blu-rays became the new ""thing"". I'm now converting all the alien films to Blu-rays. I was kinda skeptical at first purchasing this since I wasn't sure if it came with both theatrical and unrated versions or if it was just one of them. Once it arrived the read the fine print on cover to be delighted that both versions of each films were on this edition.

6600722,4,B00MS02GIY,"Excellent steal!  Two great movies for only $5.  The ""Alien Vs. Predator"" movies were not loved by critics and in fact were slammed by them, but the real critics are the audiences who enjoyed these movies.  The two films are no brainer action/sci-fi entertainment.  Don't expect Shakespeare acting or great dialogue.  The first movie is better in that respect than the second one.  The second movie is bad acting and dialogue, but that's not why we watch these films anyway.  It's still an enjoyable guilty pleasure.  Each film has its own disc, which is nice since you never know with these packages.  Sometimes they put them both on one disc where you have to flip it over for the other movie.  How cheap can one get?  The only reason I didn't give this package 5 stars is that the ""Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem"" movie is awfully dark.  I know it's not my screen as no other movies I play are like that and neither is the first ""Alien Vs. Predator"".  The Requiem movie is so dark in places that I can't even tell what's going on during certain times.  I've brightened my screen to the max and its still dark.  I can only come to the conclusion that it's the DVD print itself.  I noticed some others mentioned that issue on here as well too.",1481932800,14,1241,4.448888888888889

6600741,4,B00MS02GIY,"I love big dumb action movies, they're my bread and butter. I'm a movie buff. I like artsy stuff, I like serious dramas, I'll watch rom-coms. If it's good, I'll give it a try. But, my favorite genre of movies is and always will be the action movie. For all their shortcomings, actions films are entertainment at its purest and most essential ingredients. Besides, it's harder to make a good action movie than it is to make a good drama. It might be harder to write a drama, but the act of making an action film is infinitely more complex.

That being said, the AVP films fall firmly in the ""it's so bad it's good"" camp. Like the Resident Evil films, these movies exist purely to make a quick buck off of an audience that just wants to see big pretty explosions. Sure, it's easy to hate on a movie like this. But at least a movie like this doesn't pretend to be anything else than what it is. When you buy this set, you know you're buying two movies that will have cringe-worthy acting, cheesy action scenes, and really dumb decision making.",1460332800,2,1040,4.38860103626943

8674419,5,B00MS02GIY,"Idk what up with some of these reviews but my copy arrived today in perfect condition it did have both rated and unrated versions of both movies. The quality is a step up from the DVD, as now you can actually see the movie its no longer what just looks like a black screen. This is now only my personal opinion but the movies are both way better than I remembered them being, maybe they just aged well for me.",1523318400,,409,4.125
