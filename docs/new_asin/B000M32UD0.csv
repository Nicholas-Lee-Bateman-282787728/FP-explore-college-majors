8166035,3,B000M32UD0,"This DVD starts with Li Bingci demonstrating the first 10 movements of the Wu Long Form, but that's the last thing he does in it.  Students demonstrate the long form, the competition form, the sword form, and the saber form.  The video is subtitled in English, but awkwardly; however, that doesn't hamper its prime purpose, which is simply to show the assorted Wu forms, performed well.  This is NOT an instructional video; there are a number of videos in this series which are, however.

Single camera, one angle, no frills.  A visual record of the forms and that's all.",1199232000,,571,4.7272727272727275
