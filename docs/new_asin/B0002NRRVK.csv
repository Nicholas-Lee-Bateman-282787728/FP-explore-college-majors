2108681,5,B0002NRRVK,"I ""mistakenly"" saw this concert on HDTV while checking out my new television.  It is by far the best of the rock and roll era I have ever seen.  I had to search and find the DVD and buy it.  I did.  Dion has never been better.  He and his group are really having fun on stage!",1117584000,2,276,3.7719298245614037
2108682,4,B0002NRRVK,"Dion DiMucci is more than the sum of his parts. Doo Wop icon, the day the music died legend (Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper airplane crash), drug abuse,re invented Catholic/gospel artist,father, husband to Susan and now grandfather, author, musician and street poet.....yet somehow Dion still seems to be ""left out"" from a wider auidence.

Amazingly talented at 65 years old, he performs with a smartness that is missing from so many other veteran performers. I own and listen often to all his music and the Doo wop era aside, he has produced first rate albums that get critical acclaim but little

notoriety. ""Yo Frankie"" for starters.

This tape suffers (from my viewpoint) some of the same treatment.

1. It wasn't long enough to showcase this seminal R & R talent.

2. The Tropicana front row was not sold out. I've seen him live and he has the best audience rapport imaginable. A less than sold out show was inexcusable.

3. A bigger band would have been a bit better. Bass player on stage noticably absent. Sax man Colton (a Dion mainstay)looked silly but blows some serious horn as would be required by Dion who loves the sound of horns.

4. ""Written on the Subway Wall"" with a guest ""walk on"" by Paul Simon should hae been performed.

5. Back up singing cameos by Lou Reed and the Everly Brothers would have topped a ""live Dion."" Saw him once with the Everly's

and the show was a ""stopper."" My guess is no one asked Don and Phil who would have obliged in an instant.

I'm suprised the Emcee wasn't long time idol and the man who inducted him into the ""Hall of Fame,"" Lou Reed.

6. The acoustic performances were splendid. He can play blues guitar with the masters. I saw him hone his skills many years ago

with guys like Ron Kickasola at the ""Flick"" in Coral Gables next to the U. of Miami.

7. This should have been more of a ""call in show"" so Dion could have talked more to an audience instead of a cheesy Atlantic City

hotel setting. He is so witty and funny...we missed out on this aspect of his personality.

8. He seems to really enjoy himself and never takes himself so seriously that the music suffers.....in fact it envelops you.

9. In what would have been a ""live tribute"" stroke of genius,Dion & Bruce Springsteen could have re-invented the joy of an audience and its performer with a rendition of an acapella....""If I shoud fall behind.....""

10. Still, the man has his chops, contnues to create albums of a superior quality and even though South Florida wants to claim him as one of their own, Dion is and was the Prince of the Bronx, the King of the New York Streets.

Worth every penny and more.

Attitude the way it should be!",1107043200,5,2654,4.491666666666666
2108683,5,B0002NRRVK,"Dion is lasting.  His work has spanned several decades and there will be day when this rock'n roll hall of fame star will be noted even more prominently in early years of rock and roll.  Lou Reed said he had great ""chops"" and if you don't know what that means - buy this DVD.  A handful of his largest hits coupled with some acoustic interludes and introductions this is both a concert and a personal meeting with Dion.  A live concert and more.  Years have passed but his vocal chords have not!  His range still is wide and takes you away.  Beat, rhythm and tune, tune, tune.  Enjoy.  You will not be disappointed!",1099180800,8,615,4.371681415929204
2108684,5,B0002NRRVK,"This is great, to watch Dion perform. He sounds as good as ever just as he did on last years ""New Masters"" CD which featured new versions of his hits. Filmed at the Tropica in Atlantic City, Dion performs with gusto his hits taking us on a musical journey of both nostalgia and musical history; his history and also of rock; where it came from and what it meant to him and how, to a certain extent, it applies today. Interspersed between some of the concert footage, he talks about his roots and it's fascinating to hear him talk about how Hank Williams, black music, and Jewish cantering played a role in what he did. Something I found interesting was how some of his vocal emanations came from saxaphone players he heard in theatres. Besides the main concert, there's a separate section which has Dion filmed while sitting on a stool talking about his music and singing in an accoustic setting. If he had done all his songs this way, it'd be a great buy. In this section he talks about Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens and why he didn't take the airplane in which they died along with The Big Bopper. The only downside to this dvd are the so called celebrity testimonials which consist only of written words from Lou Reed, Waylon Jennings and others that are hard to read or near impossible to read. I had expected live interviews. But that aside, this is a blast. The concert list: Walking Blues (accoustic studio), I Wonder Why, I Let My Baby Do That, Ruby Baby (collage including American Bandstand version), Amazing Grace/Love Came To Me, Drip Drop, Ride With You (accoustic studio), A Teenager In Love, Blue Monday, The Truth Will Set You Free (Accoustic studio), King Of The New York Streets, Abraham Martin and John, Donna The Prima Donna, Runaround Sue, The Wanderer (we find out who he really was).",1098662400,60,1807,4.597523219814241
2108685,5,B0002NRRVK,If your a fan of Dion's music - this is a must buy.  The video is excellent - a High Definition transfer in the widescreen format - incredibly clean.  The 5.1-DTS audio format is also an outstanding soundfield. The only shortfall is that it is only 60 minutes in length...,1097712000,8,272,4.42
2108686,5,B0002NRRVK,The man has not aged one bit and can rock with the rest of them. All the big hits are with the same energy as when they were first recorded.

All the Dion songs that I listened to on the radio as a teenager are on this video.  His voice might be a little older but he can still sing and entertain.  I loved ""Amazing Grace"" which I had never heard done by Dion before.  The band and backup singers were really good too!",1394150400,,435,4.0588235294117645

2108707,5,B0002NRRVK,"I purchased this DVD a ways back. We always expect the sound we heard when it was new. Well this wasn't, at least not entirely. There were times you heard the original Dion, I mean he was everywhere in the day, I loved it. You have to appreciate that all artists voices change to a certain degree. Few sound like they did when they are young. When he belted out Runaround Sue, I was delighted. Him and the whole crew were fantastic. He tells stories about the creation of the music and plays solo this is great stuff. They even include in the extra features the American Bandstand performance of Ruby Baby. Listening to that really punctuates the difference then and the sound of this later live performance. But believe me, he still sounded great and had a fantastic band. On the last song, The Wanderer, he sounded as though he was running out of steam, but, then, so would you. I count myself lucky that I lived in the day when he was big, and even luckier that I have this to remember him by.",1315699200,,996,4.360215053763441
2108708,5,B0002NRRVK,"I happened upon Dion Live when selecting videos to watch via NetFlix streaming.  Was I ever surprised.  I love the oldies and have always liked Dion and the Belmonts, but never imagined that Dion and his music could have aged so well.  I love the stories he tells.  Love the way he has stepped up the oldies without changing the sound too much from how they were originally done.  And I'm amazed at the later stuff that Dion has done, which never made it to main stream.  He does doo-wop, blues and just plain good old fashion rock and roll.  I liked Dion Live so much that I purchased 3 copies; one for myself and two for baby boomer friends that I thought would be blown away (and they were).  It's all I've played for the last month and still have not gotten bored with it.  I have hundreds of vinyl albums and hundreds of CD's.  This is by far my favorite.  Buy it.

2108730,4,B0002NRRVK,"Okay, there IS something strange about watching a late-middle aged man singing `Why Must I Be a Teenager in Love?"" Still, it remains the anthem of adolescent angst, and Dion, circa 2004, not only wrote it, but kept his musical chops pretty much intact, too.

 I sought this dvd out after hearing Dion on a public radio interview program a while back and, after getting over the fact he was still around, getting knocked to the floor over how good he sounds.  All the old hits are on this disk - Runaround Sue, Donna the Prima Donna, The Wanderer - with Dion being ably backed up by on keyboards and drums, guitar and sax.  Dion doesn't talk to the live audience, but the program is interspersed with Dion and acoustic guitar sitting on the stool and reminiscing.  There are also plenty of cutout scenes, including a vintage tape of Dion's appearance on the Dick Clark Show.

For the hour's worth of great songs I still couldn't give this one five stars.  Dion's in the Rock `n Roll Hall of Fame, and he deserves a biography - you know, pictures of his youth, recap of his career, interview with old neighborhood friends, voice-over narration.  There are text-only reproductions of testimonial letters from Paul Simon, Lou Reed, Waylon Jennings, Bob Dylan.  The letters are tough to read on anything less than an HD television.  They're nice, but the subject deserves more than that.",1162080000,11,1382,4.6970954356846475
2108731,5,B0002NRRVK,"Dion's music on this concert is better than ever before.  Outstanding backup - great vocals, sax, keyboards, etc.  The video quality is unbelievable and the DTS sound is great!  I love every song in this concert.  You just can't help clapping your hands and stompin' your feet.  Truly amazing!  Go Dion - keep these backup guys. You all are just too much!",1152230400,2,355,4.645161290322581
2108732,5,B0002NRRVK,"I just got this video, and I have watched it three times today....

I think what comes across mare than anything is that he is one of the coolest rockers that has kept it real and true... His music sounds as good as it was in the early years, his voice was smooth with a edge of that New York sound, that is truly a gift from God...

 I saw him reently on a Christian Catholic program, and he was not into himself at all, just sharing his journey, this is as rare as being cool and rocking and lovin God all at the same time, this is very refreshing....

Dion, you are gifted for your many talents, and you are using them with a touch from above, Stay golden, and remember we love you now more than ever, Jeannie from California....",1151452800,5,732,4.133802816901408
2108733,5,B0002NRRVK,"The outfit the sax player is wearing? Wow.......... <LOL>.

Seriously, I won't repeat what everybody else has been oohing and aahing about, but just want to throw in a couple quick comments. I had no idea Dion was that good a guitar player! He doesn't really show it on electric during the concert, but the between-number acoustic pieces he does are killers - the man cooks on that Martin 6-string!!

Also, the love and caring he puts into his music after all these years is a real upper. This is feel good music.... ;-)",1149206400,2,520,4.5212765957446805
2108734,5,B0002NRRVK,"Wow, to have seen this live would have been memorable.  This DVD is next best thing.  Filmed in Tropicana, Atlantic City, 2004, it is stereo sound, widescreen aspect and it runs 60 minutes.

A gem on this includes a short piece on ""Amazing Grace""; it would have been more amazing to hear the entire version.

Great Early Stuff
The early songs ring with a fresh sound, but they still belong to the 50's.  I love the way he sang, ""Donna, the Prima Donna""; ""The Wanderer""  ""I Wonder Why"", Runaround Sue""  and ""Teenager in Love""  From later into his career, he sings ""Abraham Martin and John"", what I called an historic tribute to the fallen leaders.

King of the NY Streets!
Although he only did one from ""Yo Frankie"" cd, he performed ""King of the New York Streets"" with such pride and gusto!  Never had I seen him perform that song and it was a treat to see.

And, how cool is the backup band??!!
They are interactive, visually interesting with true harmonies and doo wopping. They lend an awful lot to enhance the mesmerizing voice of Dion, no one can ever sound like him!

In between songs, Dion plays accoustically, and chats about his influences, the blues, and he refers to his music as ""black music filtered into an Italian neighborhood that comes out with an attitude, YO!""  He also does ""Walkin' Blues"", and Fats Domino's ""Blue Monday"".

Other songs include:  ""I Let My Baby Do That"", Drip Drop"", and ""Ride With You"".

A bonus to the CD is a One on One interview with Dion.  He talks about people, like the guy he wrote about for The Wanderer.  He said the guy was ""worth a song"".  Dion also shared the night he turned down the ride in the airplane that killed his touring buddies, Buddy Holly, Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens.

Along with a Photo Gallery, what is included is the celebrity testimonials from Dion's 1989 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, however, disappointing as it is, you can only read it, and it is often too small print to read.

Amazing concert, so play it loud!!  ......Rizzo

I highly recommend his CDs:

This DVD is superb. His voice is still strong and I enjoyed  the studio stuff with just the man and his guitar almost as much as the on stage live stuff with a kick ass back up band. I believe this guy can sing anything. It's too bad an artist of this stature doesn't get more exposure.

Watching this video so many years later, I learned that Dion was, and still is, a very talented and sensitive artist who was heavily influenced in his youth by the Italian-American subculture in which he was raised and by African American music, including the blues and the big bands playing at the Appollo theater in New York City. This video transcends the tiresome rock'n'roll nostalgia genre because of Dion's interesting musical influences and his personal genius in incorporating them into music we loved. The other night, I brought it to watch at the home of a friend, and he liked it so much that he asked to keep it so he could watch it a few more times.

The DVD captures Dion at a recent, lively performance in Atlantic City.

Having been a big Dion fan all my life (Dion and the Timberlanes [mid 50's], Dion and the Belmonts, Dion solo). I expected a very good performance ... and got (not surprisingly) a GREAT performance instead! If you like Dion's music, get this DVD, forget the job/bills/mowing the lawn, crank up the sound, and just enjoy the heck out of a great concert. I played the DVD three times in a row, I liked it so much, and I've never done that before.  I agree with a previous observation that the back-up band was terrific, both on music and singing. I also agree that they were better than the Belmonts. One last observation: I'm a die-hard DOO WOP fan. I noticed many Doo Wop performers, on other DVDs I own, copying not a few of Dion's hits ... testimony enough. Enjoy.",1120176000,26,869,4.465408805031447

Great arrangements with ""Love Came To Me"" , ""Donna The Prima Donna"",  ""Teenager In Love""...... If you're a Dion fan, you will not be disappointed with this concert.",1118707200,3,422,4.48051948051948
8029786,5,B0002NRRVK,"I've loved Dion's singing for decades, but had no idea he was a really good guitar player until I saw this really fun concert.  Apparently, they hid it deliberately in the belief being a guitar player would hurt his cred as a lead singer.  His voice and guitar sound great here.  So do his band mates, who mostly look like NFL linemen.  Wish I could have been there live for this great concert.",1518998400,,394,4.3561643835616435

8029790,5,B0002NRRVK,"This is a great concert disk if you have ever enjoyed Dion's music.  He talks between song and tells you the story about how a song came about. He does the songs you want to hear. He's old and does not have what he had in his 20's, but maybe what he has now is even better.",1452816000,,273,3.789473684210526
