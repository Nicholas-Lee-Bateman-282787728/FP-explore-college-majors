6265686,3,B00IJG5502,So there is an obvious answer as to why I fought through crowds of hundreds to see the Blair Witch Project on opening night at my local indie theatre but was able to rent Exists via VOD on its opening day.  Exists simply pales in comparison when stood up side by side with Eduardo Snchez's first masterful stab at found footage.  Exists lacks the suspenseful script and developed characters that made the Blair Witch such a blockbuster film that has stood the test of time.  Perhaps the biggest problem with this film is that we know what the monster is in the opening scene.  After that there is no mystery just a series flat characters making bad decisions which leads to the obvious conclusion.  Half hour in I really just started rooting for Bigfoot.  Ugh and I was so looking forward to this film.,1414195200,4,802,4.534722222222222
6265687,5,B00IJG5502,"Exists is a 2014 found footage cryptid Horror film. It was directed by Eduardo Snchez, the man behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>. Though I'm not the biggest fan of found footage films the twist of adding a Sasquatch made this movie worth my time. As far as Bigfoot movies are concerned this one does a good job at capturing the reported aggressiveness and strength that these creatures are said to possess. The fear that the five young adults displayed is palatable and expressed appropriately throughout the film.

I enjoyed this movie and find it to be worth re-watching in the future. Mr. Snchez does a great job by building the momentum from the very start. There is no time to catch your breath as the deafening footfalls approach you. That said, Exists is quite possibly the best Squatch horror film made in recent years. At 81 minutes long this movie proves itself to be intense, believable, and unforgettable. It will definitely cause you to have second thoughts about heading to the family cabin deep in the Big Thicket down in East Texas, or any woods for that matter.",1414195200,65,1219,5.41578947368421
6265688,5,B00IJG5502,"This has to be the most frighting Bigfoot movie i have ever seen !
Being a fan of the genre, I try to watch all Bigfoot films that i can find,
I can truly say this one is as realistic as it is horrifying.
The special effects are great for this type of film,
Bigfoot was more than a man in a monkey suit running around, but took on the life of a terrifying beast !
Well worth the rental, would purchase when available..very well made and well acted !
Very much enjoyed the sub-plot and quality of the story***",1414108800,10,508,4.09

It has a good budget and a story and writing that go well together. The actors do a great job of their interpretation of regular people that have never gone beyond bike trails and simple hiking trails. So they nail the regular person that enjoys the wilderness and just wants to go out and have fun, not worrying about what is out there. The cheese factor is kept in check and the humor only has a small part so it doesn't take away from the movie.",1516233600,,571,4.2

6265699,4,B00IJG5502,"This is a great Bigfoot movie. I was surprised because I hate found-footage movies, and I thought the Blair Witch Project (same filmmaker) was overrated, boring and anti-climactic. Where that failed, Exists succeeds.

The acting is (mostly) good, and its not boring, it gets almost immediately to the action. Plot-wise some may call it simplistic, or cliche, or whatever, but I don't know what anyone would expect out of this. Its not a woodsman documentary, where they're looking for Bigfoot so there isn't the hyper-accurate signs (wood knocking, giant Xs, tree bending, whooping or any of that stuff. If thats what you want, theres hours of YouTube videos of dudes wandering through the woods.

If you want an intense, really well done movie of trying to survive Bigfoot (and he looks awesome), this is the best youll do.",1512777600,,824,4.963768115942029

6265710,3,B00IJG5502,"I gave it 3 stars despite the fact that I didn't really like it.  I enjoy creature features, but I'm not a huge bigfoot buff, but if you like bigfoot movies then definitely give this a go.  It's not terribly original in that it follows your standard, creature picking off people in the woods, formula, but it does it fairly well.  Acting is on par with average, cinematography is pretty good, and they keep up the tension through most of the film.  The creature effects were overall pretty decent.  The only real thing lacking in the film was decent character development and some plot depth.  You have no real reason to care about any of the characters when it comes time for them to start dying, and in the end I'm just left feeling kind of 'meh' about it all.

Overall, if you're not a bigfoot fan, I'd check something else out because this is a little boring.  Otherwise, its not the worst and you'll see more of the hairy ape than you want.",1499472000,,945,4.390804597701149

6265713,2,B00IJG5502,"To me, this movie can be summed up in one word - ""meh.""

I really didn't find any of the characters likable due to the mediocre acting, so I didn't have a reason to root for anyone's survival. To be fair, though, sometimes the acting was decent but usually seemed way over the top. In general, the effects weren't bad, although I wasn't a big fan of the way Bigfoot looked. This was likely because I wasn't interested in the movie from the start, though. I found the film began so-so and progressed rather poorly. It was just too blah for me to care. I actually paused it several times to do other things, and was never in a big hurry to get back to watching the rest.

FYI, many people on here count this as a found footage style of film but there were quite a few parts of the movie that were filmed differently. I would say about 85%  90% of the movie was done in the found footage style, but there were definitely some parts of the movie that were filmed more like an actual camera man was doing the work. Maybe this won't bother anyone else, but, to me, it ruined the found footage vibe the movie was going for.

Overall, this movie just seemed like another ""dumb friends go somewhere they shouldn't and end up in danger"" scenario - one seen many times before, but done far, far better. So, I would say watch it if you are either a big fan of Bigfoot, or just really, really bored.",1497312000,,1386,4.238636363636363

6265716,4,B00IJG5502,"This is pretty straightforward. Its an unsubtle, action-driven, found footage film about some vacationers who stumble across bigfoot in the woods.  Id actually favor Willow Creek (2013) when considering found footage bigfoot films, and it does a better job of both. Unless you want excitement, that is. Exists delivers constant excitement with empty characters whereas Willow Creek is a character-driven super-slow burn.

Almost as soon as we push play things start getting weird for our protagonists after hitting an animal of some sort on their way to a cabin in east Texas.  This film wastes absolutely no time (or tact) with subtlety.  Just minutes deeper and we don't just hear its howls, but we make frequent blurry sasquatch sightings.

Despite the abundant evidence of a sasquatch (or several?), this film starts out feeling rather boring.  The characters aren't interesting, the shaky shots of bigfoot aren't really impressive (or effective), and I just don't find myself caring about anything going on here.

One bearded vacationer, rather certain from the start of a cryptozoological presence, remains ever prepared, filming everything in hopes of capturing evidence of this large-extremitied hominid.  Meanwhile, everyone else doesnt care or believethey just want to have a good time.
As things escalate in our opening act (i.e., the first 30-35 min) weak jump scares follow up lame pranks or party shenanigans, and the unsatisfying action is so abundant that no actual event ever really matters.

But hold onis this film about to take a turn for the better?

Reminiscent of Ashs twisted bridge marooning (Evil Dead 2), our bigfoot sabotages our survivors only way outharpooning their car with a small tree. Bigfoot straight up Jason-Bourne-sprints through the woods in the most satisfying scene of the film so far!  Later he gets a hold of one of the girls and its aggressively exciting and brutal, even if shaky and goreless, as he slams her ragdoll body around like Hulk whipping Loki.  But whats important to note here is that I think Im beginning to forgive the boring first 30 minutes of this movie.  After that stupid first act, this really picks up and becomes something fun!  Im not going out of my way to recommend this, but I must admit this ended up feeling quite worthwhile.

This film toes the line between horror and Tremors (1990).  Its not nearly as funny (nor does it try quite that hard for comedy), but it relies more on raw physicality than actual scares, terror or tension.  Things started out a bit dodgy and the characters were all weak, but director Eduardo Sanchez (The Blair Witch Project) pulled off an entertaining experience mixing feistiness and intensity.",1494374400,2,2699,5.056433408577878

6265731,5,B00IJG5502,"Because between The Blair Witch Project and this, Edwardo Sanchez would be guilty of some serious character defamation. I was shocked at how this movie terrified me at some points.  No one should expect a monster movie to be this scary. As for the found footage style, all that the myriad of clones since Blair Witch Project have proven is how difficult it is to pull this off effectively and convincingly. The great ones always make it look easy. It isn't.

The makeup isn't what makes this film so effective. It's the sound, and just enough glimpses of the creature to allow us to fill in the blanks (as opposed to BWP, where literally everything was filled in by the viewer).  Just incredibly effective and scary.

Considering that the inspiration for the BWP was films like In Search of Bigfoot and The Legend of Boggy Creek, Sanchez has finally come full circle and created a retelling of what has influenced him most. It is a real success.",1486684800,2,945,4.640718562874252

6265749,1,B00IJG5502,"Found footage films have been done to death, and its hard to find one with a fresh and unique take amidst the myriad of POV flops and fails.  So, when the progenitor of the genre, director Eduardo Sanchez, of Blair Witch infamy, released his latest vantage venue, I was intrigued to see if he could truly best his firstborn flick.  It took all of the five minutes of this hour and twenty-six long farce to realize that there is nothing new under the sun.  Sanchez moves from witches to Sasquatch in this tale of terror in which five obnoxious hipsters are hunted by what can only be equated as Harry, of Harry and The Henderson's, homicidal brother.  The ridiculously poor performances might be forgivable if not for the stale and utterly unscary story that drags, even through its attempts at tension and thrills.  As for the found footage aspect, it is done poorly and predictably, even inappropriately adding music emanating from nowhere, to further contradict its own concept.  Although I will admit, once the missing link of lore is unveiled, he is somewhat impressive, especially seeing how difficult it is to make Bigfoot frightening thanks in large part to his commercial sellout as a beef jerky pitchman...or pitchbeast...whatever.

6265763,5,B00IJG5502,"If you like Bigfoot movies, and especially good ones (which are virtually impossible to find) then you will want to see this. I bought the digital version on Amazon Prime Video and loved it.

Yes, it's a found footage film, but from the folks who popularized the genre and who did it so well with ""Blair Witch"". The production quality is excellent, the cast is good, and the creature is definitely well worth the price of admission. They did this right. Great moments of suspense and some real moments of pure terror. I'll never feel the same way while mountain biking again!

Look, folks. Bigfoot movies generally disappoint me. Either the production quality is poor, or the cast is terrible, the story is a joke, or the creature is laughable, or any and all combinations of those things happen and I just shake my head in disbelief. With ""Exists"" you get all the good stuff and none of the bad. The story moves along at a good pace, the characters, while seemingly typical (kids in a remote cabin) are actually pretty darn good.

The most I'd give this movie is 3 stars & that's because I thought the casting & acting was decent & over all it wasn't a bad movie...but I wouldn't go so far as to call it good either. It was basicly a 3 act movie: The 1st act they were going to the cabin, the 2nd they were at the cabin & the 3rd they were escaping the cabin. I won't give away the ""plot"" (if you want to call it that) of the movie, but it is revenge. The end was the absolute WORST!

An interesting story line with unexpected moments. If you're a Bigfoot movie buff, then let me put it to you this way, The Legend of Boggy Creek meets Night of the Demon, but better than Night of the Demon. The director stuck close to the roots of Bigfoot lore.

The Bigfoot itself, is amazing. No over-sized suit that jiggles or some Halloween mask face. Forget the naysayers that are bashing this movie. There are plenty of people giving 5 star ratings on Nightbeasts, and that movie sucked more than Jenna Jameson on a 12 hour shift. I think the cast and crew of Nightbeasts are in cohorts, giving their movie outstanding reviews and bashing the better ones.

6265803,1,B00IJG5502,"This is basically just every single cabin in the woods movie you have ever seen.  It's got five 20-somethings in the woods with a monster picking them off one by one.  The plot is boring and recycled from countless other horror movies, the characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is so bad and repetitive that it's downright annoying.  At one point I was ready to throw my remote at the TV if I heard the word ""Bro,"" or the phase, ""That's his bike!"" one more time!

What gets me is that this movie starts out with a bigfoot getting hit by a car.  Yes you read that right, the elusive creature of mystery that has avoided capture by mankind for millennia, was walking down the road and got hit by a car.  And then the creature they hit ends up being a bigfoot child and it's parent comes looking for revenge.

Really?

So let me get this straight, your kid was walking down the road going TOWARD the 2 ton metal vehicle that was travelling at 60 miles per hour with the lights on and the engine running, the music at a high volume, people inside talking loudly, and got hit by it and you're mad at the people who were inside the car?!  If anything it's the kid's fault!  If these creatures are supposed to be intelligent, you'd think that the bigfoot kid would see that thing coming and get the hell off of the road!

I mean I know that animals, deer for example are basically stupid, and when you are driving and they are in the road and you have your high beams on and your horn blowing, the deer will just stand there and stare at you stupidly right before they get hit, but come on!  This thing is supposed to be the missing link!  Its supposed to be somewhat intelligent!  Use your brain and get out of the way!

Oh and lets not forget that the creature they show in the freeze frame and the one you see at the very end that is supposed to be the one they hit is a totally different color and different size.  And speaking of the creature, the one doing all the killing looked more like a guy in a gorilla costume from Party City than it did an actual bigfoot.

Moving on, the characters were just so dull that I didn't even care when one of them got killed.  None of them had anything about them that made them interesting or made me want to root for them.  Plus they were just stupid.  At one point they find a gun and a cellar that they hide in and youd think that would be the perfect place to ambush the creature.  It can only come at you from one direction, that door.  So just sit there with the gun pointed at the door and whenever you see it poke its head through there, pull the trigger, repeat until its dead, problem solved.  But no, they shoot randomly, yell a lot, do dumb things and just got on my nerves.

All in all this is a terrible movie and I cant recommend it to anyone.  Dont watch this.",1460937600,3,2822,4.191094619666048

6265850,4,B00IJG5502,"WHOA!  If there's one Bigfoot movie to watch or rather, if you're forced to watch one and want the very best one out there... one that's truly terrifying (well not *truly* terrifying, hehe, sorry got ahead of myself there!) it's definitely Exists!

This is LEAGUES better than Willow Creek which never really accomplished anything substantial and expected normal spooky woods atmosphere to carry the film along, Exists takes a radically different approach.  This one focuses on Bigfoot going ballistic and causing nothing but violence for a poor group of unsuspecting teens.  THAT's how you make a Bigfoot movie!  Atmosphere means nothing for those of us familiar with forests and animal sounds.  You should be ashamed of yourself Willow Creek!

When I say Bigfoot causing nothing but violence, destruction and chaos, I really mean it!  Of course Bigfoot's appearance when we see glimpses of him running around through the woods chasing after bike-riding teens is similar to an ape which I suppose makes sense in a way, but it's not until the very end do we see an up close shot of Bigfoot's face which is fantastically scary.  Perhaps the characters could have been more memorable.  Other than Roger Edwards getting fed up with the constant running, Bigfoot growls and other frights courtesy of the giant ape-like creature, nobody else really makes an impression.

Of course the movie has a flaw- that being the teens in the beginning are typical party lovers which means bad writing for the rest of us that goes nowhere, and of course Exists relies on a found footage documentary approach which is hardly ever a good decision in my opinion, but it honestly works in this case.  The terrifying nature of this Bigfoot enhances the writing in a big way.  It's important to remember Bigfoot doesn't really exist (no pun intended, hehe) so you have to pretend in order to fully appreciate Exists, but once you let loose you'll be sure to enjoy this.

Some people might prefer a quieter and slower moving storyline to absorb the atmosphere.  Exists isn't recommended for this group of viewers. But for the rest of us, those that love intense teen killing excitement, this is for us!  Highly recommended.",1446854400,2,2199,4.91869918699187

6265874,4,B00IJG5502,"Being an aspiring horror director myself, I remember several yeas ago wondering why no one has done a Bigfoot \found footage film yet, seeing how found footage was becoming so popular at the time, (and still is) and Bigfoot seeming like the perfect vehicle for that kind of film. Well someone finally has, and did a pretty good job.

The movie is directed by one of the directors of The Blair Witch Project, so it's no surprise that found footage is secondhand to him. The story is about your typical group of friends, instead of teens, this time there early twenty somethings, who go out into the woods for a weekend get away only to stumble into BIGFOOT territory. The acting is a notch better than the cheesy acting you tend to see in most slasher flicks and the cast is divers racially (which is a GOOD thing) and despite all of the actors being pretty new faces they all seem perfectly cast in their roles. The found footage is handled pretty good, as the director doesn't go too shaky and manages to give the film a REAL movie feel despite the found footage aspect.

Ask for the man of the hour, Bigfoot, like in any monster movie you have to do two things well: Have realistic makeup and costume and know when to go for the money-shot and I can say that the director delivers on both fronts providing a more realistic look to the Bigfoot costume than the cheesy looking outfits you always see in those supposed ""real"" Bigfoot videos. He also uses the ""Jaws"" method of direction and doesn't show too much of the monster too soon, but you do get the money-shot when the time is right. The DVD provides an informative audio commentary (which has always been my favorite special feature) by the director and writer, deleted scenes and a few cool behind the scenes featurettes that really give you a sense  of how it was to shoot in the middle of the forest.

The discovery of the creature(s) is done very progressively, and in such as way as to intelligently build suspense. Hints are left in the path of the viewer throughout to help explain why the campers are under siege. The culmination of this film is chilling, yet could be a highly accurate projection of the outcome of an encounter with a creature whose world man has accidentally or recklessly intruded upon. One only hopes that the way this film ends could happen, as it leaves one with the message that humans must respect what we don't know or understand in the wilderness, and that compassion may eventually be what allows man and Bigfoot to accept each others existence. Peter Byrne, Roger Patterson, Grover Krantz, Rene Dahinden and most other accepted Bigfoot experts (past and present) would all approve of both the details of this storyline, as well as way in which it is presented.

Bigfoot films have been an interest of mine since I saw The Legend of Boggy Creek way back in the day. So any time a new one comes out I am very likely to pick it up. So when I learned about this one I was very interested. It was a Sasquatch flick in the found footage style. So my brother and I went into it ready for some good old yeti action.

The film follows some friends who take a trip out to a cabin owned by the brothers uncle. All is well at first until the roar in the woods starts to get closer. They are soon attacked by something big, strong, and fast after hitting something earlier with their car. They try to find a way out but phones don't work and their car is torn apart. Add in that no one knows they are there and it seems all hope is lost.

This film is much better than that short little thing I just put out there. At first my brother was not into this one but he soon changed his tune. I really enjoyed this film from the tension built to the payoff. The best thing though may be that we actually get to see the creature, not overly but it doesnt hide it as well. The film was well made and shot well especially for the found footage thing. Of course with the guy that made The Blair Witch Project made this so he knows what he is doing.

The DVD comes with a great making of behind the scenes and more but it is that commentary I enjoy the most. I recommend this flick to any horror fan out there. If you like the found footage format or Sasquatch flicks then this is for you. Very well made and believable like others have pointed out.

The acting and character development are better than a lot of horror movies I have seen and the story makes sense and has a logical drive and momentum. I found it easy to suspend disbelief and get caught up in the story. The ending is pretty predictable because the writer basically tells you why the sasquatch is so aggressive near the beginning, but it gives the movie a good sense of closure and I found it satisfying. Better than I lot of movies in this genre. I found this movie to be the best Bigfoot/Sasquatch movie ever made in my opinion, not that that's a very high bar to jump, but this movie jumps it by a mile.",1432425600,5,665,4.285714285714286

The plot is largely predictable, so don't expect it to cover much in the way of original ground, but even though you can anticipate what's going to happen next, you might find yourself still jumping at the points where the director wants you to be startled.  I'm a fan of minimalist horror, where what you don't see on screen is more horrifying than what you do see and Exists fits fairly well into this category.  I won't say much about the monster to avoid spoiling anything, but I was greatly impressed by the effects and costume used.

6265957,2,B00IJG5502,"I find myself continually saying this: Im not a fan of found footage movies. On the rare occasion one is done that actually pulls off something good but for the most part they tend to get repetitive or present people so caught up in filming whats happening around themselves that they become more of a joke than seem like someone actually trying to record events as they happen. Consider this my attempt at a warning along the lines of the names and places were changed to protect the innocent.

That being said I didn't know what to expect with this film. To begin with it was directed by Eduardo Sanchez, one of the two directors of the film that really kicked this genre into high gear, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. While for some that seems an achievement for me it meant little since I was never a fan of that film, finding it tedious until the last 10 minutes or so. So reading that piece of information on the cover meant nothing to me.

The movie covers a weekend retreat of several friends in a cabin in the woods. The cabin belongs to the uncle of two brothers that are part of this group. What they fail to mention to the rest is that their uncle told them never to come up here and spend the night. The group plans to have a nice weekend away and to film themselves riding bikes with Go-pro cameras, small cameras that attach to things like helmets and deliver a decent picture. A lot of what happens in the film is captured by these cameras though of course not enough that you get a perfect picture of what ends up as the danger in the film.

Suffice to say, and most will know this going in having read the box for the DVD, what they encounter on this weekend is a Bigfoot. But this isn't the tame Bigfoot weve seen in the past, this is something thats on a rampage. Again, not so much a spoiler but stop if you're concerned it might be, the group hit something with their car on the way up but never got a good look at what it was. Only the truly ignorant will not realize early on that it must have been part of a family of Bigfoots (or would it be Bigfeet?) and that whoever is left is not happy with this group.

The group realize that they need to get out only to find the road blocked by a tree. Then their car is damaged beyond repair. Finally one of them decides to ride their bike (Im talking mountain bike not motorcycle just to clarify) down the road to get help. Hoping to move fast enough not to be caught this is actually one of the better moments in the film. The Go-pro footage of the Bigfoot running as fast as it can to reach the biker actually comes off as somewhat frightening. But since there is plenty of time left in the movie you know the odds of this biker making it are slim to none.

In fear for their lives the group tries to find a solution to their problem. But at the same time they make sure that they have their cameras ready to go all the time. They use the night vision to see what is attacking them but don't use that information to protect themselves. And while were at it, where do people in movies like these get these extensive batteries that rarely run out of juice when I cant get my cell phone to retain a charge for longer than a day tops. These people are in a cabin with no power and yet their cameras seem raring and ready to go at all times.

If these things weren't enough to let you know how stupid this group of five characters are then consider the other dumb things they do. While all are definitely in their late twenties or early thirties they all swear like teenagers whove just discovered the F bomb, using it non-stop. A friend is attacked? Take the time to film it and not help. A camper is about to go over a cliff with you in it? Dont try and get everyone out, just keep making sure the shot is in focus. These problems put on glaring display the problem that I have with found footage movies. The people involved are so caught up in filming everything going on around themselves that they never react to the things happening. Sorry but if Im being attacked by a giant Bigfoot the last thing on my mind is the deposit I left on the Go-pro cameras. And remember this while in the woods  safety in numbers and travel by daylight.

In the end there are some decent moments when the Bigfoot actually gets into the scene and interacts with the final campers. Those moments offer a creepy looking creature that could scare kids at night but not most adults. Had the movie been done with a better script and better acting and tossed aside the whole found footage concept it might have made for a decent horror film. As it stands its not something Id go back and watch again nor suggest to many people. Perhaps Id suggest it to Bigfoot fans but not wholeheartedly. Other than those Id pass it by.",1428537600,3,4760,4.2519337016574585
6265958,5,B00IJG5502,"I've grown tired of movies where people go into the woods and get attacked by a man in a gorilla suit for no reason. This is thankfully not one of those movies. The motivation for the hostility is both realistic and believable if you go for the belief that these creatures are capable of higher thinking. The ""found footage"" film style actually lends itself very well to the subject matter as well. Although you get to see the bigfoot a lot it's hardly more than flashes of movement or momentary views that give you just enough to get a sense of dread. When you do get to see the creature in all its glory it becomes clear that a lot of time and dedicated work went into designing the look.

6265977,4,B00IJG5502,"This film takes a standard cliche' standard ""trapped in the woods"" scenario and turns it into a terrifying ride. The five 20-somethings make all the usual stupid scary movie choices: they hear something and keep talking (so the monster knows exactly where to look for them), one guy, the ""third wheel geek/ tech savvy brother"" sleeps outside the cabin in a hammock, KNOWING there is a potentially aggressive Bigfoot running about, people go off ALONE in a brave attempt to catch something on video or to get help. BUT what elevates this above the level of ""oh skip this"" silliness is the paving and the performance of the actor portraying the Bigfoot. The catalyst for the ""monster""s actions happens VERY soon into the story and the pace then begins to build and build like that excruciatingly slow and terrifying climb to the top of the first hill on a roller coaster ride. The threat of something horrible happening totally unnerved me. And this film pays off. The best part, for me, were earnest performances by the cast and the truly terrifying Bigfoot. The sound of the creature crashing through the underbrush or trashing the landscape, added to occasional quick glimpses of the black hairy shape prove that less IS more. We KNOW what's out there. We only need occasional peeks to be reminded of the serious danger the five characters are in. The last 5-10 minutes is BRILLIANT and shocked this jaded scary movie viewer to the core. I cannot get over the creature make-up. It is worth a viewing just for that and the sounds of the creature. If I ever hear such while out in the woods I hope I am wearing the biggest diaper in the world because I'm going to void food into my pants I haven't even eaten yet! I'm giving 4/5 stars for ""mistakes"" the characters made that I thought people really in this situation would NEVER do. But it is really worth your time to see.",1425945600,2,1872,4.624624624624625

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and thought it was a good movie, nit just a great one. The characters are great and very believable, the Bigfoot looks great, and the acting is really solid. There are some tense moments and some good scares. But it just seemed to be too much -- I think it would have been better if the story had cut out some of the bigfoot encounters/battles. Like in most slasher flicks, the characters fight back and think he's dead, but he comes back again, and again, and again. Also looked and felt way too polished for a ""found film."" But as far as bigfoot movies go, this one is really pretty good -- certainly head and shoulders above most of what's out there. And you get to see an awful lot of the monster, and he looks good, so that should satisfy those who complain about bigfoot movies that either they don't see enough of the monster or the monster looks silly.

6265993,5,B00IJG5502,"Best Big Foot Movie to Date!

Running time approx. 1hr 30 min.  5.1 DTS HD Picture. I grew up in the 80s. So I have seen a lot of cheesy Big Foot movies over the years. But nothing good, until now. This movie rocked! This movie is only produced in Standard Digital DVD. No Blu-ray copies available yet. This is an upper-tier (B+) level independent movie. This movie is produced very well and has a mixture of (2) styles; standard film, and a kind of (Blair witch) mixture; meaning, (camcorders used by some of the movies characters). It's done in good taste, don't be (put-off) by the (Blaire Witch) thing, it's actually put together very well. This movie is reminiscent of (Boggy Creek). The movie is filled with hardcore horror, action, blood, and carnage. The acting and storyline is very good for a simple movie of this kind. The movie will creep you out and scare the hell out of you. It really will work on your mind. Big Foot is a mystery, but I do believe there (may) be fact and truth about the creature. This move will definitely make you think twice about being out in deep wooded areas or camping for that matter. This movie is by far the BEST Big Foot movie to date. It's not a documentary it's a movie and you will enjoy it. I thought I would not like this movie and would trade it away, nope! This one is a keeper guys, it's pretty damn good and I've seen it (3) times already with some friends and they loved it too.

6265994,5,B00IJG5502,"As a kid I watched an episode of the TV show ""In Search Of..."" about Bigfoot, and it scared the hell out of me! From that moment on I became a fan of the mythical monster, and I've watched almost any/every movie dealing with the creature that I could get my hands my on; ""The Legend of Bigfoot"", ""Abominable"", ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" etc. and I usually came away from the film less than thrilled.

I will say that I almost turned off ""Exists"" within the first five minutes. I'm so tired of the ""found footage"" horror film, it's just a lazy gimmick whose novelty wore off about a decade ago, but I hung in there. Two brothers and their three friends are heading deep into the woods to spend a weekend at their uncle's old cabin, While on the road they run into something on the highway, and thinking it was a deer or a dog, they jump back in their jeep and move on, despite hearing what sounds like screams coming from the woods around them. The weekend soon takes a nasty turn as they realize something in the woods is stalking them, and it doesn't want them to leave.

One common thread I've found in most Bigfoot horror movies is that they rarely have the monster actually menace anyone beyond making noises off screen, and that any and all scares are saved for the climax. That isn't the case with ""Exists"", about 10 minutes into the movie the Bigfoot attacks, and it doesn't let up for the rest of the film. There is plenty of tension and suspense in the movie, with a ton of jump scares. The creature F/X are solid, the kills are fairly bloodless, so if you are a gore-hound, you may be disappointed with that aspect. I found the entire film genuinely creepy, and lots of fun.

6266007,5,B00IJG5502,"Great film! Nothing else to say, and yet I can't help myself.

My hopes for this film were low to say the least, as it has several factors working against it; First, it is made by Lions Gate which, as we all know too well, is hit-or-miss with their films. Some are great, some are terrible and few are in between. Second, Exists comes to us from the director of The Blair Witch Project, of which I am not a fan. That is one of the movies I regret most having wasted my time to see. Third, I had never heard of it which generally means it was a straight-to-DVD release or it didn't do well at the box office. Fourth, I picked it up at Wal-Mart for about $12, which means either it's been out for a while and I still haven't heard of it, not a good thing, or it's just really bad.

So, I started the film with low expectations, just as a little entertainment for me and the kids. It seemed fairly typical; five young adults with cell phones and cameras and not enough sense to have a firearm, travel deep into the woods where we all know bad things are going to happen to them. They hit something with their car and, of course, stop to check it out which is when they first hear the strange sounds. They travel on to the cabin and we get a little peek into what their weekend is supposed to consist of, typical young adult fun and a bit of debauchery. It's worth noting here that this debauchery is not that bad, all we see is a little side boob and a guy smoking a joint. Now things start to get bad for our freaked out not-so-happy-anymore campers. The intensity of the movie begins to build, it becomes highly suspenseful and very much a scary movie.

I have seen several found footage films including The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, Quarantine, Paranormal Activity, Chronicle, V/H/S, The Last Exorcism, Troll Hunter, and many more. I have seen many bigfoot movies including Abominable and several, if not all of the Boggy Creek movies. As far as the sub genres of found footage and bigfoot movies go, this is a perfect pairing of the two and probably top tier for each, I'd rank it second in found footage and first in bigfoot. I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed this movie. I would definitely recommend it to any fans of the two horror sub genres and to most fans of the horror genre in general.",1423785600,5,2316,4.319540229885058

After disturbing the Blair Witch folklore in the woods...this filmmaker decides to return to the woods to smack the Big Foot legend around a little bit!!!  A legend that was proven false and put to rest.  Exists makes you start to believe, if only for 80 minutes, that this creature does exist and is not some costumed red neck running around the Washington State forest on super 8 film!!!

6266010,4,B00IJG5502,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Director Eduardo Sanchez is a man of many talents, and he is responsible for several excellent films Ive seen of late.  Although he is most well-known for the infamous BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which is one of my favorite horror flicks, he has also done a diversity of horror-related projects.  These include ALTERED, his 2006 take on alien abduction; a segment in V/H/S/2 titled A Ride in the Park, in which a bicycle enthusiast runs into a group of zombies and the audience gets to enjoy the chaos courtesy of his GoPro camera; and todays featured review, EXISTS, a visceral excursion into eastern Texas horror.  I am proud to say EXISTS is a heck of a movie, and it makes Bigfoot scary again!

When will distribution companies learn that you DO NOT put the monster/creature/antagonist on the cover artwork??  This is supposed to be a big reveal in most horror flicks.  That is my sole complaint about the packaging for this film.  And what makes it even worse is the image on the cover is not even what the creature looks like in the film!  But, you should never judge a movie solely by its cover, so well move on past that.

EXISTS is shot well, even considering it is from a first-person perspective.  This works for the film, as it did in BLAIR WITCH and countless other films, because it helps heighten the intensity and, therefore, the terror.  I love found-footage films when they are done well for this very fact alone, and EXISTS utilizes this film style to its full advantage.

The acting in EXISTS is good for the most part, although the characters are never fully fleshed out.  Granted, in the short time we get to know them, we DO find a few things to like about them overall, but I would have liked to have more backstory on them, so I could feel more for them once the horrific events start to happen.  This isn't a huge drawback, but just something I feel is of note.

The special effects are great, although theres not a whole lot of gore.  Instead, director Sanchez relies more on practical scares than vivid carnage.  And while Im a fan of gore, Im also a big fan of being scared regardless, therefore this is a huge selling point for me on the film.  I also like the creature effects.  The special effects team makes Bigfoot look very realistic, a point of emphasis on which every creature-feature should focus.  As I mentioned above, EXISTS makes this myth terrifying once again, and the appearance of the creature itself is a big reason for this.

EXISTS is a definite win for me, and I highly recommend this film to anyone who like their monsters beastly and vicious.  The film is available now, so check it out.",1423440000,,2707,4.5246913580246915

6266015,1,B00IJG5502,"Great trailer! Crappy movie!

This movie put out such a good trailer, dark scenes looked like some spooky things going on, a creature sighting in the woods and yes a nearly abandoned cabin in the woods on an old forgotten road and yes with the found footage theme. So far so good and then...the movie started.....

The friends who are out to party down in the woods in the long for sale abandoned cabin hit something late at night that makes a dent on the car, and after hearing some loud cries in the night and not a car in sight still decide to make the trek to the cabin despite the fact that they walk and walk until the find it and it is creepy and dark and horror movie ready.  All decide to sleep in the car and low and behold in the am the car has blood on it and the damage shows a wad of hair and you would think they would be scared , no way though they decide to go biking and swimming and while two of the friends decide to go in the woods and have sex one of the friends sees a bigfoot in the woods near them and heck rather than leave now they decide to wait up and see it out later when everyone is asleep.

After a bike chase through the woods that is a little exciting and more sightings the movie starts to go downhill fast. The friends do dumb things, the found footage idea kind of is pointless as it is not really ""found"" at all and not that scary.  When we finally get a good look at the monster bigfoot it is pretty average aka dumb looking and not so frightening and then ending with the one guy who was taking all the footage...with him talking to the bigfoot and the way it all came together had to be the dumbest ending of all time and give you one of those....

You have the two pairs of lovers and the lone pot-smoking camera nerd who films everything.

The movie watches like a regular bigger budget thriller.  Fun and believable story and characters that draw you in.  Once you care about the play between the characters and you begin to sense the presence of something/body? else lurking outside the movie gets quite good.  I like that the glimpses of whatever is outside is not over done.  I liked the use of the head camera to make it more of a personal view...drawing you in deeper into the story.  And when the first real glimpse comes on the screen you are ready.  And its real.  Watch it for the story; watch it because you believe (if you do!) or watch it because you want a good thrill.

6266033,5,B00IJG5502,"I felt that this movie was really well done! I absolutely enjoyed it, the special effects, acting, creature design, overall atmosphere were great. There are some reviewers that have an issue with it because there was little character development. This is (somewhat) true, granted we don't know the characters astrological signs, but we are told and given enough to get the gist. Also the found footage style was done well, many found footage films, will have the characters hanging onto the cameras in absolutely ridiculous situations, or there are just way to many ""convenient"" little cameras that a character has just happened to bring along. For the most part in this movie, when the camera is staying with the characters it is rather believable, such as the camera rolling around inside the camper the characters were in as it was rolled.
Also, the characters involved displayed pretty sound common sense for the most part, which you rarely see in horror films like this, especially when they are monster movies. Which was really quite a breath of fresh air for me. There is really only two circumstances in this film where I found myself going What are you doing!? And only one of the situations was an obvious common sense avoidance to give better movie footage. I can forgive this because, well, Im watching a movie after all.
I also have to give this movie big props for its ending, one common feature of most found footage movies, is the story ends suddenly, character being dragged off, camera smashed, what have you. This movie gave an intelligent and definitive ending, camera is set down, we get a moments pause, and then the movie ends. It was a solid ending, which was satisfying in that it brought a conclusion to the story.
Sure you can be over critical in my opinion, and nitpick this movie apart point for point, and if you do that, of course you are going to find things wrong with it. This is something which drives me NUTS with many movie goers now a day. I get when the movie is not trying to be serious, or intentionally throwing out common sense, be it humor, or sheer ridiculous nonsense.
But enjoy it for what it is, a story, be a bit forgiving of the small faults and just enjoy it!
Overall this is a fantastic monster movie in my opinion, which doesn't demonize the monster either. In my opinion, Worth every penny!",1421366400,4,2344,4.664251207729468

yes and no.
he was shooting an old .20 gauge shotgun and the sasquatch was probably just a hair smaller than a grizzly, so 600-700lbs.
unless he was point blank (which he wasn't) at best if loaded with hi-grade buckshot the gun would have done nothing at those distances but make it extremely pissed, so ""technically"" movie was right.

6266051,4,B00IJG5502,"""Exists"" is a new Bigfoot found footage horror film, from ""The Blair Witch Project"" director, Edwardo Sanchez. There have been a lot of Bigfoot horror films in recent years, including, ""Willow Creek"", but ""Exists"" is a much more intense and satisfying creature feature.

While there are elements of "" Blair Witch"" sprinkled in Exists, the movie is a whole different beast. The Bigfoot is shown a lot and there are some very intense action scenes. This Bigfoot looks and acts scary. Without question, Exists has the best Bigfoot creature design and Bigfoot scenes I've ever seen in a movie. You get your money's worth, if you want Bigfoot carnage.

As for the writing and acting...well, it definitely could've been better. There are some cliched horror things that the characters say and do, which is a little annoying ( I.e. They film a Bigfoot and don't think anything about it!?). The movie starts out rather slowly, but shifts gears as soon as the Bigfoot appears.

I'm giving this four stars, based on the Bigfoot scenes and the creature design, but not the writing and characters/acting.

The ending to Exists is pretty cool. Here's hoping for a sequel.",1418428800,3,1158,4.892857142857143

It features the same tired story of 20 something's going into a cabin in the woods and getting picked off one by one by a guy in a really bad gorilla costume. The characters are cardboard cut outs with no development whatsoever. There is NO cinematography on display. The movie is either in broad daylight or shot through nighttime green night idiom goggles. The film steals liberally from the creator's own Blair witch movie and Evil Dead. The plot is utterl ridiculous. The dialogue is atrocious peppered with incessant whining and screaming. Not to mention, one character doesn't even mourn the loss /death of a woman he supposedly loves. This thing(it's not a film or movie in any way) is a complete waste of time.

6266066,3,B00IJG5502,"Writer Jamie Nash, who had a hand in penning all of Sanchezs non Blair films, wastes little time getting to the good stuff in Exists. During the opening sequence our protagonists incidentally make contact with a large animal while driving through the woods to the cabin, and after replaying the footage in slow motion we get our first look at the Bigfoot. I was thrown for a loop by this because with the extreme majority of Bigfoot films you don't see the creature until at least halfway through the film, if you even see the creature at all. Nash continues this onslaught by giving us full-frontal Bigfoot action early on when he makes his first contact with the protagonists in the cabin, and from then on out its all Hell breaking loose. I can honestly say that this story has the most Bigfoot action I have ever seen, and that is both good and bad. If you are in this experience solely to see the creature lay waste to the humans then you may be in for a treat, but if you want more than that then the heavy emphasis on the creature may have a negative effect on you. The latter was the case for me, as I eventually found the use of Bigfoot to be very repetitive and evenboring. I was appreciative at first, but there was so much Bigfoot going on here that there was very little mystery to what was going on. Its the equivalent of sleeping with someone on the first date and learning their entire life story while you wonder why you are even in that situation in the first place. On top of this, everything else surrounding the creature action was pretty tame and basic at best. The characters were unlikable an I found myself not caring who lived or died, and even the storys slight twist towards the end of the film is one that you should have seen coming.

Sanchezs direction does a decent job of bringing the story to life. The shock felt during the first scene where we see Bigfoot in the video playback filmed by one of the protagonists was great, but after that the shock value was gone. We did see a lot of tense Bigfoot action, but because of how predictable the constant barrage became the ability to shock the viewer was gone, as you can easily predict what will happen next. I was glad to see Sanchez take a full-frontal approach to showing Bigfoot, which included him chasing someone through the forest to him creeping outside the cabin. The look of Bigfoot was different and not what you would typically expect, yet I will let you be the judge of whether you like his look or not. I personally did not like his mannerisms nor physical abilities, namely his 40mph sprints through the dense east Texas forest. These scenes were just silly to me and the creature stopped being creepy when he started mimicking Usain Bolt. With mediocre characters come mediocre performances, so again, much like the story, there is very little to rely on besides Bigfoot himself, and in the end even he was portrayed in mediocre fashion.

Overall, Exists is a very basic experience despite it portraying Bigfoot in an unconventional light. You see lots of creature action, yet these filmmakers still found a way to deliver an experience that is neither good nor bad. Based on this I would take my time giving this a watch, and would suggest not paying $6.99 to rent it like I did.",1417651200,2,3279,4.5

Personally, I liked that the set-up to it being bigfoot happened right away and not an extraordinary amount of time is spent ""getting to know"" these kids before the action starts.  Once it does, with a great chase scene through the woods it doesn't let up.

There was no real character build up, just a bunch of kids running around screaming out the F-bomb while being chased by a man in a Bigfoot suit, which BTW was pretty nifty. The mouth seemed to be functional.

This was a hand held camera film with the typical nighttime green scenes as well as people whisper in the dark playing ""what's that noise"" but not nearly as bad as ""Willow Creek."" This Bigfoot is in East Texas where there have been numerous sightings, some claiming even in Dallas. There is no truth that one played for the 1992 Cowboys. The opening soundtrack gives you the feeling of impending doom. One guy in the group is a camera geek wanting to make a film for U-Tube. So there are small cameras always on everywhere with infinite battery power. Some of the shots, as usual, are ridiculous in order to create the realistic idea they discovered Bigfoot. Nothing like a ground cam. At some point in time the cabin gets electricity.

There are alot of bigfoot ""found footage"" movies such as Willow Creek (which shows no bigfoot at all), Bigfoot County (which is more like Deliverance), Hunting the Legend (which also really shows no bigfoot except a shadow of one), Bigfoot:The Lost Coast Tapes (shows a little bit of some bigfoot shadows walking, but makes no sense towards the end cause there is also some two legged creature with hooves that does the killing) and Happy Camp (which they show bigfoot at the end, but it is computer animated). Well they did it right with this bigfoot movie. The costume was awesome looking and didn't look too fake. It didn't start off slow and boring, and it had a pretty good ending.

Gotta admit, I'm getting a bit tired of them but as long as they keep making them about bigfoot and aliens and the like I guess I'll keep watching.

There are issues, of course. One problem it can't help is that I've seen THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (multiple times) so a group of five twenty-somethings going off to, yes, a cabin in the woods, is always going to remind me of that film and make me wonder who bet on 'sasquatch/wendigo/yeti.'

The other big problem is how much of a cookie-cutter plot most of these movies tend to have.

This one, however, manages to play with the formula a tiny bit and that really elevates it in my opinion. It's also possible that I wouldn't have liked it so much if I hadn't just sat thru BIGFOOT WARS and WILLOW CREEK recently but I have and by comparison, EXISTS is a big(foot) step up.

Director Eduardo Sanchez - of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT - gives us a group that includes Brian, played by Chris Osborn, who tags along with the specific intent of shooting video of the trip to post on YouTube. As such, he's prepared with multiple cameras, including a handful of GoPros, to capture the guys doing things like making stunt jumps with their mountain bikes into the local lake and stuff like that. This gives the audience a variety of viewpoints on the events and cuts down a little on the 'why is he still filming/how is he managing to keep things in frame?' issues.

Another thing that gave this monster-fan a thrill - you get to see the creature! In broad daylight, even! Considering that ninety-nine percent of these movies cut to black just before we ever get a look at whatever is going on, this is a huge and welcome change. The bigfoot outfit was designed by Spectral Motion of the HELLBOY movies and other top films. It was worn by Brian Steele, doing quite the 180 from his turn as Harry in the HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS TV series.

If you're interested in either bigfoot or found-footage films, I'd say give this one a rental.",1414972800,6,2013,4.46866485013624

By far the best of the found footage genre to come out in a while (and I'm a huge fan of the film style). For once, all the different film angles make sense (due to some obvious sponsor support). Five stars all the way! What pushes it over the edge? You actually get to SEE the creature! What a novel concept for found-footage filmmaking! Great work! Loved it!

This is one Bigfoot movie that does not disappoint. It has enough intelligent characters to keep the viewer engaged, while building the drama at just the right pace. Beyond that, there is ACTUALLY a great story here as well.

This is not hack.slash! This is well thought out horror where the deaths, when they come, make sense within the greater context of the movie. This Sasquatch is a beast, with just enough humanity to make it terrifying.",1414627200,4,924,4.461538461538462

I was expecting yet another cheesy Bigfoot time-waster, but I've held out hope that one day someone would actually pull this off - and this is the movie that I've been waiting for! I can't recommend this highly enough. It's easy, certainly, to compare parts of it to Blair Witch and some obvious similarities, but if you can let those go, you're gonna really enjoy this one.

6266126,2,B00IJG5502,"Although ""Exists"" is a clear-cut above other movies of its genre, it still fails to deliver chills, jumps, or laughs.  It seems some friends steal uncle's keys to a cabin (out in the middle of nowhere), and they're off to see the wizard.  On the way there, darkness falls, they cannot see anything, and they hit ""something"" with their automobile.  Two get out to investigate what's happened and they start hearing mysterious sounds (although if you've caught ONE episode of ANY story on TV concerning Bigfoot, you know what the noise is).  They find the road to their cabin obstructed, so they spend the night in the car.  Next morning, they head for the cabin and find it hasn't been occupied since, oh, before WWI.  Now, here's where the movie just got plain ridiculous.  Instead of just leaving, they go BACK to the cabin!  Mayhem and death ensue.  All is lost...  Well, after that, I just completely lost interest.

Oh, there are some killings by Bigfoot, some more stupid moves by everybody, and then the filmmaker tries to deliver this ""Kumbaya"" ending wherein the creature and mankind can ""all get along.""  However, the creature does look decent so kudos to the makeup people.  As for being ""bloodsoaked,"" this movie is more like blood drops; there is no gore here.  Rated ""R"" for violence and language, and not recommended.",1414281600,6,1331,4.780701754385965
6266127,5,B00IJG5502,"In all of the promotion and buildup of the movie the creators never hid the fact that it was about Bigfoot. You might think that would take away from the fright factor, but it didn't. Both my husband and I were jumping and sometimes yelling at the tv.  Some horror movies are written in a way to absolutely gross you out and scare you to the point you can't sleep. This is not one of those movies. It's a found footage style movie which you'd recognize to be similar to Blair Witch. It's from the same creators so that makes sense.  It had more than enough scares in it to make you think twice about going to a cabin in the woods that isn't near any civilization. In short it was jump-worthy and had interesting camera work telling the story. I wouldn't want to run across any creatures like those anytime soon.

I want to add that I really appreciated that it was available VOD day of release because my schedule doesn't often match that of the local theater. I didn't order it on Amazon but through my local cable company.",1414195200,6,1024,4.350785340314136
6266128,3,B00IJG5502,"I had mixed emotions about this film after waiting impatiently months for a format to be released. In a year of nothing but found footage mockumentary's being released I was split on my feelings of this film. Dir. Eduardo Sanchez basically pioneered these type of found footage films with ""The Blair Witch Project"" so I can forgive a lot of the feel/vibe of the film being so close to aforementioned film. Trouble with the film is the pacing and not enough of the creature. The creature suit is very impressive and probably the the best looking Bigfoot of any previous movie. Quite honestly, I couldn't invest in the characters nor did I care if they lived or died. I applaud Eduardo on trying to recreate the 70's type feel of the Boggy Creek series but it falls short of the mark. Not a bad film by any means. I expected more than a impressive Bigfoot suit to suffice. If there's a potential sequel, I would hope they work on the script and back story first and foremost.",1414195200,3,973,4.502824858757062
8642555,5,B00IJG5502,"This movie was an absolute blast! Its fast pace keeps you completely engrossed without losing you or putting you to sleep. Plenty of action and spooky atmosphere. You gradually get to see more and more of the creature as the film progresses and you will NOT be disappointed at all when you see how believable a job they did on this! Without spoiling anything, there are several instances in the film where I was just thrilled at how great they made this sasquatch look. Usually it's a hokey looking ghillie suit or goofy, laughable monster where you know it's some dude in a suit, but this one will make you brown your trousers. The monster is every bit as fast and powerful as you'd expect it to be; Not some lumbering, heavy beast who moves at the speed of smell. Sure, some stupid decisions are made by the young folks, but there wouldn't be much of a movie if they'd listened to their old Uncle Bob and stayed far away from his hunting cabin. It always cracks me up that no one in these movies thinks to pack some serious heat when venturing out to the middle of nowhere. Even more mind blowing, is they always end up finding some Jed Clampett single shot 12 gauge and a cigar box with 7 low brass small game load shells to ward off the minions of hell with. lol  Here's yet another case where you simply can't go off of other's bad reviews or you'll miss out on a gem.

8642561,5,B00IJG5502,"I am not usually a huge fan of found footage films  they can certainly be good but more often than not at least to me aren't that great  but I was blown away by this film. I was genuinely scared in a few scenes, there was a very logical twist at the end, it had some great visuals, and overall it was a well-done horror film I enjoyed on a rainy, stormy Saturday night.

The premise was simple, a group of friends, men and women, all college kids by the look of it, go off in a Jeep to the cabin owned by the uncle of one of the boys. The cabin is remote and we get interspersed during the credits a not overly long and effective montage that shows how remote the cabin in, how much everyone in the Jeep liked to be together, and how much they were all looking forward to going. One of the problems I have with some horror movies that while I appreciate the efforts made to make the potential future victims relatable and likeable, too often these scenes can go on far too long and become a bit tedious to watch. In this film less was more and we got all we needed to know about group dynamics and individual personalities early on (not confined to the credits mind you but in some early scenes that still were to me effectively paced).

Going down the dirt road to the cabin, the only lights the headlights, with woods crowded around on both sides of the Jeep, the driver hits something. Several members of the group get out, see blood, and think it is only perhaps a deer they hit, but upon looking at something clearly bipedal caught in a few seconds of film from a camera that was really filming something else at the time (and looking at the damage and strange hair on the Jeep the next day), the group quickly concludes they didn't hit a deer.

It is isn't long before the group of friends hear roars and moans echoing through the woods, a strange dark shape that seems to be watching them through the trees, creaking floor boards as something sniffs around the cabin, strange images very briefly glimpsed at the windows at night using some sort of night vision setting on the camera that always seems to be runningand then things get worse from there, as the group faces an increasingly violent monster intent on attacking them for some reason, with the college kids essentially trapped in the cabin with no landline, no cell phone service, soon a wrecked vehicle, no neighbors, and they discover soon enough no one knowing where they are.

The majority of the movie has a high-tension level, great pacing, and lots of scares, as the increasingly smaller group tries to hide/run/fight the monster (the Sasquatch or Big Foot, by far the most effective and certainly the scariest treatment I have ever seen of this creature). Most of the film the viewer never gets a really clear look at the monster, seeing just enough to be scared, though I think the less is more approach worked, simulating for instance what it would be like to see the monster sprinting to catch you as seen from your peripheral vision as you desperately peddle down a bumpy, tree-chocked forest trail, or between eyes slit in pain or nausea from falling off a bluff, the monster staring down at you readying itself to leap upon you and continue its unrelenting attack.",1523750400,,3245,4.472972972972973

OK, a little suspension of belief when the car hit a young Sasquatch on the road. Why would they be walking single file on a country road and not get off when they say the headlights? But the scene where the biker is attempting to out race the Sasquatch was a good one, as was the face in the window and the eye through the floor cracks. Well done and scary. The make up on the creature was first rate. One of the better Sasquatch films out there.",1521244800,,619,4.254237288135593
