Also being a pirate is a metaphor for being gay, Heaven references and who can and can't get into heaven. All of that, for me, makes for a great hilarious weird movie. But I liked Saved too so if you hated Saved...........well ""This is not a weapon"" ;D",1230681600,,414,4.3896103896103895
3558827,4,B001F0TM30,We watched this on a recommendation from a friend and once finished my children immediately asked to watch it again.  This is one of the most creative and smartly written movies I've seen in a while.  It even has a good moral message which was delivered so subtly it was not overplayed.

3558828,1,B001F0TM30,"I am sorry to say I actually supported this movie thinking it was a ""family"" movie. I received a copy and was sorely dissapointed by the PG-13 rating. Kirby Heyborne (an actor who I usually enjoy) stars in this badly written, poorly acted movie about two grown men acting like pirates. Not only was the movie offensive (sexual inuendos, swearing and mild violence) to me and my family it was also extrodinarily  boring. I am surprised to see Kirby Heyborne in a movie like this. Definitely look elsewhere for an entertaining movie, this one is a flop!",1230163200,2,551,4.680412371134021

It is offbeat, crazy, and funny.  I would have thought that distributors would have learned something from the success of Napolean Dynamite.  Although, obviously not a big budget production POTGSL has alot of talent and alot of heart.  With all the pig fodder that comes out in the name of ""entertainment"" POTGSL is a breath of fresh air. It is very much worthy of a DVD collection.  Don't miss!!!",1225756800,13,573,4.514563106796117

Author: (mackay@captjackspiratehats.com) from Isle de Tortuga
*** This comment may contain spoilers ***

On Sunday Feb 5th I flew down to SanFrancisco to attend the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and the second showing of Pirates of The Great Salt Lake. I arrived at the theater an hour early in order to meet up with ER Nelson, the director of the film, Kirby Heybourne (who plays Kirk) the star of the film and several of the producers.

I was told by the SF Indie film fest organizers that the much awaited Friday night World Premiere of PotGSL received a standing ovation from a sold out crowd. I was getting so excited to see it, and hoping I wouldn't let down. I've been sitting and waiting since August, not an easy thing to do. Independent films are a tricky business, often it is the director's first film ( as in this case) , often the actors are less experienced ""unknowns"", and in almost all cases the production budget puts extreme limitations on everything. Despite these factors or because of them , Pirates of the Great Salt Lake is like finding that elusive buried treasure. This film is a real gem! It is original and refreshing, and dare I say.... OK, so I hate the comment ""it's a Feel Good movie"". just not the kind of comment Pirates should make. Well........This is a Very Very Feel Good Movie, and its a feel good Buddy Movie!! I smiled all the way through the screening Dammit! I hope I wasn't being watched or there goes my Pirate rep.. A very well thought out script ,co-written by Eric Nelson who also skillfully directs, and solid comedic performances by the principle actors had me laughing out loud within the first few seconds. It has everything that a good Pirate film should, Pirates (duh), ships (er, boats) , the plank, weapons, maps and cursed treasure, ghosts, skirmishes, thievery, back stabbing, murder, wenches ( and not all in that order) It's campy, it's tongue in cheek, it pokes fun at the current pirate culture, and stereotypes. It even pays backhanded homage to Johnny Depp. And I loved this film for it. The music perfectly underscores that our two heroes are living their Grand Pirate Dream. And while they may be two average young guys,... they are truly Pirates! There are also some unique cover versions of contemporary rock songs strategically placed that will have you chuckling. Like when Kirk and Flint meet for the first time

Spread the word and keep a weather eye open for this Treasure, and keep our cutlasses crossed that this film gets picked up and distributed. It deserves it and we all NEED it!

Synopsis: Kirk Redgrave and Flint Weaver are two young, 20- something loners in Utah who live near the Great Salt ""Sea"". Each with their own issues, they meet through chance and set out together to become the best Pirates the world has ever seen. As in real life, Piracy is a tough go for our heroes, filled with much failure and disappointment, it is a hard life ( well, three weeks anyway) and then they come across a long lost treasure map. They must battle a ruthless rival and contend a curse in order to collect the treasure and fulfill their dream. Will they or will they not....",1223856000,16,3215,4.64323374340949

3558832,5,B001F0TM30,This film was amazing!  It was funny and sweet and just a little bit twisted.  I saw it at a screening in honor of Talk Like a Pirate Day 2007 and my sides hurt after it was over from laughing so much.,1220140800,12,201,3.761904761904762
3558833,1,B001F0TM30,I absolutely hated this. There was nothing redeeming in it. I thought it'd be great because I love Kirby and pirates but no. Not worth it at all.,1404604800,,145,4.214285714285714
3558834,1,B001F0TM30,"Do not waist your money!  The other reviews must have been actors families reviews as there is no way anyone could like this movie.

3558839,3,B001F0TM30,"I saw the trailer for this and decided to buy the DVD, it was cheap so no problem there.  After watching the movie though I think I liked the trailer better.  It's one of those things where the idea of the movie seems funnier than actually making it into a full movie.  I don't think this was the filmmaker's fault though, they put forth a good effort and the movie was put together well, unfortunately it just wasn't as funny as I was hoping it'd be.

Also really weird ending, which is kind of expected with an indie film like this, not bad though.",1369872000,3,550,4.259615384615385

3558848,3,B001F0TM30,"The story plot was odd, kept a secret during most of the movie.

If you like ""different"" movies than this just might be for you. We found the movie to be too different for us. There were some funny moments, but the death didn't make much sense. Perhaps if the story unfolded in though a series of dream sequences, flashing back and forth between reality and fantasy.

The most interesting character was the indian ""guide"" with the white horse.

If you like Mr. Kerby Keyborne buy the DVD while supplies last! I don't think there will be a second run.  Pirates is definitely a low budget, Grade B movie in the spirit of 1950s Grade B movies.",1324771200,,640,4.444444444444445

3558850,5,B001F0TM30,"Most of the negative reviews come from people who are used to Kirby Heyborne's ""Mormon"" films and didn't get the same thing from this one. So, if that's what you're looking for, move on. You're not going to hear any nifty little ""Mormon"" in-jokes in this movie. (Yes, I am LDS and I enjoy the ""Mormon"" jokes too, but there is room in my library for odd, quirky, non-LDS films as well. Not everything HAS to be a ""family film"" in order to be fun and enjoyable.)

But if you like quirky comedies about grown men doing odd, strange, non-sensical things and just generally watching people have fun with a concept, this is a great movie. There is a ""storyline"", albeit a weak one, but like most quirky movies like this, that isn't the point. Does anyone care that Monty Python and the Holy Grail's storyline is weak? NO! It's a great quotable classic and this along the same vein. So, don't complain about the ""weak"" plot line.

Overall, this is a great, fun movie for a wacky, giggly evening.",1275955200,2,988,4.483333333333333

3558852,1,B001F0TM30,"Don't waste your money on this one.  I'm sending my copy to sleep with the fishes.  Arrrg - big dissapointment,not much of a plot, bad acting and filming(scene transitions are bad).  Not sure why it has so many positive reviews (makes me wonder if those involved in the movie have done any of those reviews - hmmmm?)",1261008000,,316,4.508771929824562
3558853,2,B001F0TM30,"I stopped this movie like 35 minutes into it.  It went back in it's case and got dropped back at the public library.

I mean, YOU might like this.  Obviously some people do.  And, believe me, I really wanted to like it.  Ever since I got some promo card for it a few years ago, I've been very excited about it!  It's been on my Amazon wishlist ever since I knew it was here.  The trailer is funny.  It HAD to be great!  Ya!

But this movie is just not piratey.  Bummer #1.
It's actually more like ""'Garden State' meets 'Napoleon Dynamite' wearing 'Pirates of the Carribean' attire""... but bad.  PotGSL stars two grown men who run away from home like angsty, depressed teenagers.  They pretend to be pirates and live by stealing.  They have a couple smartly funny lines and kooky situations.  I didn't (couldn't) finish it but I expect it's supposed to be some kind of comedic drama about two misfits finding their way?  A ""human"" adventure?

But then the moping starts, and it's not really that moving.  I was annoyed rather than sympathetic.  Bummer #2.

In fairness, you can tell these guys really tried hard.  And they aren't ""bad"", even though I didn't like their characters.  This just didn't come together - for me.  Maybe it's because I was expecting oodles of piratey goodness and PotGSL didn't deliver on that.  Since so many people seem to like it (and will probably down-vote this), I'm hesitant to say it's a wholly bad movie.

Score:
1 star, just because everything gets a star.
+1 star for having potential.
That's the best I can give it.",1259366400,,1552,4.536231884057971

3558861,5,B001F0TM30,"I have to say this movie is not for everyone but then neither is Monty Python and the Holy Grail or any other film.  Some may consider it boring as I did in a few sequences.  Some movies really should be shorter to maintain effect, this is one of them.  However, I never liked movies trying to appeal to everyone since they really never hit the mark anyway for me, must more formula stories.  However, for those who love comedy or pirates this is a new classic with a future cult following for generations.  It is somewhat similar in tone to Napoleon Dynamite and if there is one thing I have learned about any movie but especially comedies is the things you can get out of it from repeated watchings.  I get something new each time I watch it, which is really unusual for me, typically when I watch a film once that is it for me.  That is another reason I love this film, from all the campiness, including the fake hand that gets carried away by the dog only addes to its charm.  I wouldn't want it any other way and I still recommend this film! Although probably not a childrens movie if you want that go buy the latest Pixar or Disney film they are usually good and stand up well for family fare.
