1930139,5,B0000DZTIN,"I remember when Night Crossing was first released in the theaters. It was a pleasant surprise from Disney Studios. What especially appeals to me about this movie is the fact that in the face of defeat and what seemed to be a hopeless situation, two families refused to give up, and with great determination and courage accomplished the impossible. I never forgot this movie and have long awaited its release on DVD. It is a welcome addition to my library.",1073952000,18,455,4.7

1930173,5,B0000DZTIN,Loved this movie as a child--loved watching it with my now adolescent children.  Great educational/discussion experience for older children.  There were a couple of spots in the movie where the video quality was not fabulous.  Not sure if the issue was due to streaming or the video transfer.,1483833600,,292,5.041666666666667
1930174,3,B0000DZTIN,"Based on actual events culminating in an escape from East Germany, in 1978, during the Cold War.  We had learned of it watching new NetFlix program called ""The White Rabbit Project"", by some of the TV Mythbusters people.  While watching the 1982 movie, we looked up some actual facts, as to how it actually went down, we found that Hollywood, as is typical, took LOTS of ""poetic license"" with the actual facts.  They DID build a balloon, which 8 people actually did escape over the fence into West Germany (barely).  Many of the stories within the story actually did not take place.",1482796800,,582,4.676470588235294

1930176,4,B0000DZTIN,"No big stars, no acting performances for the ages, but a very well-crafted movie about a famous escape from East Germany that focuses on the choices people made and their implications.  I rented this after a recent trip to Berlin where I saw the remnants of the balloon they used for their successful crossing.  The juxtaposition made for a moving experience.

It's hard to believe that East Germany disappeared 25 years ago.  I happened to be in Berlin for the 25th anniversary of German reunification, so the movie made an even bigger impact because of that.",1477872000,2,560,4.802083333333333

1930190,2,B0000DZTIN,"I lived half of my life trapped inside Eastern European communism and managed to escape to West Germany roughly about 18 months after the balloon escape. It goes back to my kindergarten days in Berlin when on an early Sunday morning in August the city woke up divided, and to this very day I carry the air of that time with me. Today, as an American, I have an unique vantage point of being able to discern this movie from two very different, culturally opposite perspectives. Bottom line up front: This film presents a rich story in a superficial manner. To an unprejudiced observer, when compared to this movie, a well-made documentary about the real life drama of the two protagonist families determined to reach freedom at any and all cost, would have been a much more interesting clip! This is a rare instance where the reality is far more imaginative and symbolically suggestive than a romanticized representation that is poorly directed and produced. The film is relying heavily on the viewer having an intimate background knowledge of what life inside the communist block was like. By failing to establish this fundamental prerequisite of the plot, it is impossible for the viewer to enter the harrowing depth of desperation that can push a human to realize that in the end freedom is all that matters. Otherwise, the two families may ""appear"" to be doing ""okay"", relatively speaking; an argument could be made that at least from a passing glance, they have a relatively ""livable existence"", children appear to be healthy, they own a car and a hitch trailer (albeit we are being tipped off that this is somehow an unusual perk), they live in two story homes (unlike under a bush in Africa or in a high rise drug infested project in Chicago), they have some savings in the bank (that they can use to buy expensive balloon paraphernalia), a TV set, and hey, they can even go to picnics on weekends to play ball on a grass field by the river, BBQ, beer, etc... How tough can that be after all, one may ask!?... There are also more subtle questions that a poignant viewer may come up with: one of them has a small construction business going, and this one is tricky to get it - because in a totalitarian state only the most ""loyal"" socialists where allowed to own small businesses, which were highly regulated and not really profitable beyond what the State deemed to be an ""appropriate income"" (profit is not really part of the socialist lexicon). Therefore, we are left to guess how did this family manage to achieve their current status, what did they have to do to appear as good socialists. We see that there is some indoctrination practiced inside the privacy of their home at least by the grandmother who at some point, unconvincingly, turns off the TV set and admonishes the child for watching a benign West Berlin television show about some tropical island, saying: You know we are NOT allowed to watch West German television! But, again, it takes an astute detective to pick up some of these almost ""subliminal messages"".
In another poorly built clip, one of the protagonists in support of his argument to leave is telling his wife that he wants to make something of himself: ""I want to be a mechanic! (to me this was reminiscent of Marlon Brandos: I could have been a contender!) - Well, here our viewer is again left to wonder: ""Hey Sport, why can't you BE a mechanic here and now? What stops you?... The film fails to make us understand that East German citizens had very little choice of picking their job specialties, where they lived and even their places of employment; you had to work where the State puts you to work right out of school, period! Communism is a plantation owned by the absolutist State, a slave master. You may be a well-off slave, a better fed slave, even a favorite slave to your master over others, but in the end you are still a SLAVE to the system and you shall always toil within the boundaries of this plantation for the rest of your life! Your children inherit the same! Id say that the average first year out of college movie director could have done a better job preparing the viewer to better assimilate the narrative. As it stands, our story barely begins to describe the emptiness of life inside a system that can be summed up as a jail of the size of a country. Yes, it does attempt to depict some food shortages when a lady and our character both contest over the last remaining vegetable left in the crate on a farmers stand and then are embarrassed by their selfish pettiness  but I just think that THAT was such a trivial representation of what real food shortages were like inside DDR. People standing in line all night (mostly the retirees in the families with free time on their hands), elbowing their way to the front like animals Again, sure it wasn't like Ethiopia, but East Germany was an otherwise civilized, European society, highly educated, resourceful and industrialized, so to be reduced to mucker around all day for basic sustenance, amplified the cultural shock on people forced to live a robotic, communitarian existence. I had my first orange for Christmas when I was 7; I never knew a banana tastes like until I was 14, and I was one of the lucky ones - ours was a family loyal to the socialist government with my father a Communist party member. To get ahead inside that institutionalized, closed-border system, people had to adapt by rationalizing themselves as loyalists, informers, policemen, or unnoticeable working stiffs who did not attract any attention. However, even if you played by the rules, there were no guarantees that youll be better off. In a sense, they were all sharing the same space with the same monster.
Another dimension of this film left underdeveloped was the practical depiction of human ingenuity; how did they overcome the almost insurmountable challenges of manufacturing this machine without open access to materiel, specialized tools or engineering knowledge, and to do so in an utmost secretive fashion. Sure, we intuitively know that these were all big challenges, but to do this inside of East Germany it was tantamount to building a shopping mall with just a pocket knife. I just think it would have been very satisfying to let the viewer in on a few details. We learn from one border policeman who observes in reference to the mechanics of the balloon that this is pretty ingenious, but we are left to wonder what is that ingenious?! Again, the fact is that they accumulated the engineering know-how by piecing together information from seemingly unrelated publications, and did this while under constant scrutiny by the prying eyes of neighbors, would-be informers, even from family members living under the same roof; simply going to the public library and checking out a bunch of books about balloons was not an option, as it would have triggered instant suspicions. Then, there is an even deeper, second level of ingenuity that was needed to camouflage for dual use; how to build this thing out of scraps or out of seemingly benign materials. We know that they modified a barometer to make an altimeter out of it. But there was a heck of a lot more complex stuff worth mentioning, such as how did they perfect a gas blower, how did they build a large capacity regulator, etc. We should have been let know the reason why the burner kept dying on them during flight while there was still gas in the tanks (defective or missing pressure check valves) and why didn't they get it right the second time around; get the viewer into the action! MacGyver could have learned a trick or two from this guys and I just think it would have been interesting to elaborate. Such as how did they trim the material without a full scale pattern template? This was huge and in the end, the geometry and appearance of this flying thing was perfect, with alternating color stripes, equally spaced rope railings too. Definitely a rental balloon from the nearest advertised business  not believable and not realistic; sorry! Finally, there were the tools! In East Germany certain tools were highly regulated or unavailable, such as welding equipment, oxygen tanks, certain pliers, cables, etc. Getting your hands on such items it would have attracted undesired attention and irreversibly terminate your enterprise most abruptly. I would have loved to see the real balloon photos after they landed it in West Germany, all jerry-rigged and quilted together like a cabbage-patch doll.
Next, the alienation of family relations needed to be better explored. There is a scene where the main character playing the wife converses with her mother and tests her in a seemingly casual fashion if she ever thinks of applying to immigrate to West Germany? The old lady replies: No, why should I? Then our character changes the subject and we are supposed to believe that a suspicious grandmother, who otherwise feels that something is going on, won't latch on to that and pelt his daughter with a bunch of questions. I cannot overstate how critical it was for anyone who was thinking to escape to not discuss their intentions with anyone, or even mention the word immigrate. A family member, or a close friend can get scared and betray you with their tense behavior if nothing else. For that reason, I am amazed to this day that these people planned and made their escape as a group. Most successful escapees did it alone! One added reason why I am so very proud of them for what they have accomplished and why interpersonal relationships should have been probed deeper in this film!
Finally, the technical production, just as many reviewers are taking note of, is extremely poor. Camera shots are amateurish at best, night shots are underexposed, and sound quality was embarrassing. Giving the technical resources available at the Disney Studios, this truly is baffling!
I wish for a follow up movie and hoping for a professional production this time. Like we had in the second Miracle with Kurt Russel, which was as close to perfection as they come, compared to the first, uninspired version done in the 80s.
This movie has been an all-around missed opportunity to inspire our own citizens on the eternal values of liberty, at a time when America is ""flirting"" with socialism in complete ignorance of the repetitive lessons of history. I was saddened at one reader's comment saying ""I do not like to hear about that part of history""... History is not about how it makes us feel; it is not a bowl of cherries. We do not have the power to isolate a sequence of past events and select only the parts we like! History exists for one reason only: to be learnt, so that we won't have to LIVE through any part of it that we don't LIKE, ever again!
Any East German who succeeded to escape to the West, was instantly recognized as a West German citizen. That was a law little known outside that country  East Germany was not recognized as a separate nation, but as an occupied region. Perhaps this was a final point that was not driven home as well as it should have. There was a widely circulated photograph in the media at that time, of the two families proudly displaying their newly acquired West German identification cards shortly after their successful flight to freedom, would have made for the perfect ending to this film. Just my lengthy two cents.",1472601600,9,11330,4.744421906693712

I already paid for shipping and returning at my cost would end up costing more than the item cost in the first place.  I think this seller takes advantage of the fact that the normal consumer is not aware that there are two kinds of DVD players and hopes to sell otherwise difficult to move merchandise to an unsuspecting client who places trust in the service that we have come to expect from AMAZON.

1930402,3,B0000DZTIN,"Tja, wenn Amerikaner versuchen, Deutsche darzustellen (und noch dazu in einem der wichtigsten Kapitel unserer Geschichte, nmlich die der innerdeutschen Teilung und deren spektakulrste Fluchten ber die damalige Grenze), kann ja i.d. R. nicht viel gutes heraus kommen.

Das mag bei ""Operation Walkre - das Stauffenberg Attentat"" eventuell noch geklappt haben, - in diesem Streifen dagegen versagte dieses ohnehin schon seltsame Konzept auf der ganzen Linie.

Hier wurde zuletzt gesagt ""dieser Film wre das beste, was der Rezensent zum Thema gesehen htte"" und bisher gaben alle Kommentare auch 5 Sterne ab. Also, - dann mu dazu die Frage erlaubt sein, ob es sich hier wohl nur um Zuschauer der sogenannten alten Bundeslnder handelt !?

Denn jedem (!) ehemaligen DDR - Brger wrden hier sofort etliche Ungereimtheiten auffallen. Der Film ist eine Disney Produktion (und das sagt schon einiges aus ;-) aus dem Jahre 1982. Hier wurde die - 1979 so real stattgefundene - Geschichte der ""Ballonflucht"" der Familien Strelzyk und Wetzel aufgearbeitet.

Anfangs sehen wird den kleinen, thringischen Ort Psneck, in dem die Beteiligten leben. Nach dem erfolglosen Fluchtversuch des Jugendlichen Lukas, der noch kurz zuvor gezwungen worden war, Unterschriften gegen eine andere Flucht zu sammeln, beschliet Peter Strelzyk (bevor auch sein Sohn eines Tages auf diese Idee kommen wrde), mit seiner Familie zu flchten.

Dafr kann er seinen Angestellten, Gnter Wetzel gewinnen. Schnell wird der Plan gefasst, mit einem selbst gebauten Heiluftballon ""mit dem Wind nach Westen"" zu entkommen. Anfangs gestaltet sich das relativ leicht. Der bentigte Stoff dafr ist zgig beschafft und auch nach den ersten Aufstiegsversuchen gelingt alles.

Gnter Wetzel steigt allerdings vorher noch aus dem Projekt aus, weil seine Frau Angst davor bekommt, das die gemeinsame Flucht (auch wegen ihrer kleinen Kinder) scheitern knnte. Also versucht es Peter Strelzyk allein mit Frau und Kindern.

Weil aber durch die Luftfeuchtigkeit die Hlle des Ballons zu schwer wird und ihnen unterwegs das zum Auftrieb bentigte Propangas ausgeht, sinkt der Ballon noch vor der Grenze auf ostdeutscher Seite wieder im Sperrgebiet. Nur mit viel Glck gelingt es der Familie, von hier wieder nach hause zu gelangen.

Strelzyk ist verzweifelt und entmutigt, - allerdings machen ihm seine Frau wieder Hoffnung und sein Sohn weit ihn darauf hin, sie mssen noch einen Fluchtversuch wagen, weil sie ja nun ohnehin frher oder spter von der Stasi entdeckt werden.

Und diesmal ist auch Gnter Wetzel mit seiner Familie wieder dabei, die sich dazu entschlossen haben, weil sie die Konsequenzen, als Mitwisser bestraft zu werden, frchten. Der zweite Versuch gestaltet sich schwieriger, quasi ""stckchenweise"" mu der nun grere und neu bentigte Ballonstoff zusammen gekauft werden (denn alle Textilgeschfte wurden inzwischen angewieen, bei greren Bestellungen die Behrden zu informieren). Schlielich gelingt die gemeinsame Flucht am 16.9.1979.

 - / -

Soweit zu Handlung ... warum uere ich mich nun aber als erster Schreiber hier negativ ? Ganz einfach, - weil man den propagandistischen Stellenwert des Film's, also, die ""Botschaft"", die er damals vermitteln sollte, hier eindeutig zu hoch angesetzt hat. Das beginnt schon bei den rtlichkeiten. Mann konnte ja schlecht in der echten DDR drehen. Also wurde offenbar versucht, das ganze nachzustellen.

Der Ort Psneck (hier angeblich Thringen) sieht daher natrlich auch aus, wie ein amerikanisches Bergstdtchen, was es vermutlich sogar war. Darsteller der beiden Hauptfiguren sind u.a. John Hurt (Brite) und Beau Bridges (Amerikaner).

Lediglich nur in den Nebenrollen verkrperten wirklich deutsche Schauspieler (Klaus Lwitsch als schmieriger Stasispitzel und Gnter Meisner als dessen Vorgesetzer) ihren jeweiligen Part.

Quasi nebenher sieht man noch Sky du Mont, der sich in der deutschen Synchronisation auch selbst spricht. Das unpassende daran ist nur, sein deutlicher Akzent kommt dabei eben eindeutig so mit rber ...

 ... ansonsten haben sich leider auch die blichen Amerikanismen mit eingeschlichen, fter's fallen Kommentare wie ""okay"", - einer der Shne Peter Strelzyk's wird ""Fitcher"" genannt.

Die Stasi wird u.a. mehrmals als ""SD"" bezeichnet (heit also fr die damalige Propaganda, ist mit dem frheren Sicherheitsdienst des NS Staates gleich identisch !?).

Was allerdings positiv berrascht, ist, das teilweise echte Ostfabrikate unter den hier verwendeten Fahrzeugen zu sehen sind, wie Wartburg 311, ein Trabant 601 und sogar der Moskwitch 408 (eine sowjetische Automarke). Dafr kommen aber andere technische Standard's dieser Zeit, in der das ganze spielt, wieder nicht vor.

Am Schlu z. B. fliegt die Staatssicherheit frontal mit einem Helikoper auf den Ballon der Flchtigen zu. Kaum geht dem aber wieder das Treibgas aus (und er leuchtet somit nicht mehr am Nachthimmel), haben sie ihn fr immer verloren !?

Das Radar normalerweise aber den Vorteil hat, auch bei absoluter Dunkelheit zu funktionieren, sollte eigentlich sogar jedem Laien auf dem Gebiet hier zweifellos klar sein.

 - / -

Wie auch immer, ich sah diesen Film das erste mal bei seiner Free - TV Premiere noch vor der Wende im ZDF. Und damals hatte die hier gezeigte Handlung natrlich anschlieend sehr groe Diskussionen ausgelst.

Von daher stellt er sowas wie einen durchaus nostalgischen Hhepunkt dar (dh. fr jeden ehemaligen DDR - Brger, der ihn ebenfalls vielleicht auch noch so, wie ich selbst kennt). Deshalb auch, trotz seiner vielen Fehler, Ausleihtip, - bzw. Kaufempfehlung.",1344988800,,5543,5.539099526066351
1930403,5,B0000DZTIN,This is an absolutely wonderful movie.  I saw it first about 30 years ago.  We showed it to our Girl Scout troop.

It is not an overstatement when I say that 'Night Crossing' is an ""Intense Suspenseful Masterpiece"". READ THE REVIEWS! There were no negative reviews.

Because there are so many reviews of the motion picture 'Sound of Music' this will be my review of of both movies. Both films are more than wonderful and both have a similar theme.

As an escape movie, 'Night Crossing' does not have the never to be forgotten music or the romantic love story of 'The Sound of Music', but it is much closer to what really happened. Truth is less glamorous but often more interesting than the myth. The love story in 'Night Crossing"" is the love of freedom that people can't appreciate unless they have lived under tyranny. (See my review of the book 'A Puppet No More'.)

If you loved 'The Sound of Music' (that was not as true as 'Night Crossing'), you will appreciate the true story of the Trapp Family Singers : See ""Movie vs. Reality The Real Story of the von Trapp Family By Joan Gearin"" (available on the internet). There were 10 Von Trapp children not seven. When Georg Von Trapp asked Maria to marry him, she said her answer was yes, not because she loved him but because she loved the children. They did not escape across the Alps to freedom but took a train to Italy. I personally heard the real Maria speak soon after 'The Sound of Music' was released. When asked if the motion picture told her true story, Marie replied emphatically, ""SWITZERLAND IS NOT AUSTRIA""!

Even though 'The Sound of Music"", was not completely true, I BELIEVE IT IS THE BEST MOTION PICTURE EVER MADE, not 'Citizen Kane'. The true story of the Von Trapp Family Singers is not an escape story at all. 'Night Crossing' deserves to be called the best escape film ever because Disney recorded the true story as accurately as it could possibly be shown on film. And the courage, bravery, and ingenuity of the two families that built the balloon to escape across the Iron Curtain into West Germany is unsurpassed.

'Night Crossing"" is not glamorized in any way but it is still as intense and suspenseful as any film. Your whole family will be spellbound by this memorable true story.

Footnote regarding the motion picture 'Citizen Kane': Even though it is on MANY and even most lists as the ""Best motion picture of all time"", I don't think 'Citizen Kane' even deserves one star. It was panned by a number of reviewers as the most tedious, boring, put you to sleep movies ever (and I agree). One reviewer said, ""I had to endure two hours of this to find out that William Randolph Hurst missed his sled? Give me a break!"" One of the most insightful reviewers said. ""They should subject the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay to 'Citizen Kane' to get them to confess."" (You won't go to sleep watching 'Sound of Music' or 'Night Crossing'!)

When you have a Jane Alexander and Beau Bridges on board joining John Hurt(of ""I, Claudius"" fame)in a foreign locale you get fantastic results. Even though the true events are distant now, this cold-war story is as chilling and exciting today as it happened. Ably directed by Delbert Mann, photographed sharply with minimum special effects, Disney has delivered once more a family adventure as interestingly as can be done in the tradition of ""Swiss Family Robinson"" or ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.""

1930418,4,B0000DZTIN,"In this movie two families living in East Germany in the 1970s plan an escape across the Inter-German Border (IGB) in order to find freedom in the West. Their ingenuity, planning and perserverence in trying to get over what was a formidable barrier designed to imprison those who disagree with the life offered by Communism is heartwarming. They construct a balloon to fly over as the Stasi, the ever-present Secret Police, are constantly on the lookout for those who would try to penetrate the fences, land mines, manned guard towers, automatic machine guns, vicious guard dogs and other barriers. The balloon, which flew on a dark night in 1979, had other advantages in that it was invisible to radar and very hard to track from the ground without searchlights (which I would be surprised if the DDR actually had). I would have given this five stars except that I didn't think the film did enough to show the oppressive nature of East Germany's ""Socialist paradise"" but still it is a wonderful movie and one I would gladly recommend to anyone.",1311724800,5,1045,4.811111111111111
1930419,5,B0000DZTIN,"There are countless excellent dramatic stories about people who tried and either succeeded or failed to cross the Iron Curtain to the West. Unfortunately, few films have been made on this topic. Night Crossing is just such a story, not only because of its intrisic worth, but because it was one of the very first to bring the topic to the screen at a time when it was nearly impossible to do so in the West, such was the Communist infiltration at the time of all branches of the mass media (East Germany began in 1945 and it wasn't until 1982 that a film on the topic was made). I was particularly surprised that Disney produced the movie, considering its penchant for fluff; maybe they decided to get back at the Communists in Chile who at that time declared (I am NOT making this up!) that Mickey Mouse was a Fascist.

What I found particularly well handled in the film was the tediousness involved in the escape process; it took numerous purchases of cloth to make the balloon, numerous sessions of sewing the material together, numerous trials, numerous equipment modifications, yet the tediousness involved in such endeavors does not weigh in on the viewer, though the efforts are mentioned within the film. Two anomalies that I found in the movie: one, the American/British/Canadian measurement of feet and yards and miles in a continent that uses the metric system. The other were the haircuts by the men. If I remember right, such Western haircuts were anathema and Soviet style haircuts were almost mandatory (the same fashion since 1917).",1309219200,,1548,4.797752808988764

As I watched this at the museum I was sitting next to the actual balloon - it's incredible that they ever made the flight....and I was crying at just the thought of it.  I have also been to Check Point Alpha, which is outside of Fulda, Germany.  This is also museum/memorial and really gives one a sense of what the border crosings were like....these were truly desperate people.

This if a true story and, although set in more recent times, harkens back to, and and the aftermath of, those days.  I remember the wall going up and was blessed to witness it coming down.  A story of the thirst for freedom that so many Americans take for granted.

This movie gives great insight into the climate of the times and the desperation of people who had lost their liberty.  And the bravery or foolhardiness of those 2 couples!  The balloon was actually sewn by the men's wives.  The balloon was not as pretty as the one in the movie, and more of a hodgepodge of diverse materials.  But those facts do not diminish the importance of this film.  Have your children and grandchildren see it, and show them a map of Germany with Berlin an island divided in the midst of East Germany, and the country divided. Great for history classes.

1930438,5,B0000DZTIN,"This movie is simply superb, all the more so because it's based on the true story of the Wetzel and Strelzyk families escaping the communist dictatorship in East Germany in a hot air balloon they built from scratch.  They had no idea about hot air balloons when they made the decision, just a deep desire for freedom and a passion for tinkering.  Their story is a fabluous testament to human ingenuity and longing for liberty.  The movie tells the story suspensfully, candidly and is accurate in almost every detail of the escape's preparations over 18 months and eventual success on the night of 15th September 1979.

The cinematography of the inner German border and East German military equipment is excellent especially given the very limited access that Disney would have had to it at the time (1981 at the height of the Cold War).  All in all a must watch for anyone inspired by escape stories and desire for liberty.

1930439,5,B0000DZTIN,"This is really an outstanding film, and I would recommend this to anyone who has not yet seen it. Set in Germany before the Wall came down, it is about a couple families who want to escape the communism in the East and come up with a daring plan to do so.

Since this is A)Disney and B)a true story, one would assume the outcome is a happy ending, right? Not so fast! I dare you to sit still through this movie and peacefully await the ending. It is truly a thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat!

When I watch movies like this (going against the communist machine, etc), emotions run high--at least with the good ones. This movie does not disappoint on the emotions or the thrills.

As for the acting, one of the wives was less than stellar, but she was the only weak spot. Don't let that stop you from a great family film!",1275350400,,831,4.149068322981367

The Strelzyk and Wetzel families desperately want to leave Communist-controlled East Germany so they decide to build a huge hot-air balloon to carry them over to West Germany. Not only is it risky relying on a balloon to carry two families, they also have to avoid East German police. This is a well-crafted Disney film that the whole family will enjoy. The cast includes John Hurt, Jane Alexander, and a then-unknown Beau Bridges. Although I'm very happy to own this on dvd, this is a bare-bones dvd as far as special features go.

The depiction of how life was for people in East Germany, who were under communist rule was terrible, yet sadly accurate. People under communism are not treated kindly.
