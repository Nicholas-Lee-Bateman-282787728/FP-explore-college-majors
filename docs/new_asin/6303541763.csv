7850165,5,6303541763,Good family spy comedy.  Nothing like a cheesy 80's spy comedy to make you feel better.  This is a hard to find gem.,1522800000,,116,4.0
7850166,1,6303541763,"This film is fairly innocent, speaking in relation to the Title it carries, and in saying that, the film is also weak in plot, contains banal acting, leaves one quite bored, and is remarkable dated. This is an early 80's film, and is well representative of that. The plot is drawn out beyond what it should have been, and could have been made into a sitcom lasting about half an hour, but runs the full length of a movie.",1401926400,,421,4.341772151898734
7850167,5,6303541763,I have been looking for DVD for a long time and so happy when it came out.  I have on VHS.  Ed Beagly Jr and Harry Anderson are great as team.  Linda Purl was great as Ed Beagly Jr's wife.,1375833600,,188,3.65
7850168,2,6303541763,"Well...someone else's review convinced me to buy it, but I may be able to help someone else avoid it.  It was silly at best, as the actors (a term loosely used) waste their talent and time as they sleepwalk through this film before going out to kill their agent for getting them into it.  It is meant to be light fare, but it is so poorly written and acted that the humor of the farce becomes pathetic rather than witty.",1328313600,,420,4.2375
7850169,4,6303541763,"I've always been a fan of Ed Begley Jr. Me and all my pals in Langwarrin tend to have Ed Begley Jr. movie marathons, and this movie tends to be everyone's favorite. (A close second would be ""Transylvania 6-5000""). I've always enjoyed a mystery, and this one's a doozy.",998438400,3,268,4.489795918367347
7850170,5,6303541763,"This movie is great!  It keeps you guessing until the end!  Harry Anderson plays a guy who may or may not be a secret agent on a mission from the President.  Just when you think you have it figured out, it twists on you.  Incredibly entertaining, though you'll see the ending coming well before it  gets there.  Was hard to get for a long time, but I'm glad to see it's  back!",958608000,6,376,4.138888888888889
