1549436,4,B00005JOXO,This was a well done movie. It has it's emotional parts and its intense parts. the acting is good and does not look low budget.i reccomened this movie.,1173830400,4,151,4.428571428571429
1549437,2,B00005JOXO,"Actually I came across this movie in a different way.  I was hoping to download 30 Days the tv show by Morgan Spurlock but instead I got a Basketball movie.  I was quite upset because I wanted to watch 30 Days the TV show but decided to give the movie a chance.  It showcased Da Brat and Taye Diggs so I thought, hey this cant be so bad, right?

I was wrong.  Most of the movie I laughed through because the movie was so poorly acted.  In scenes that are supposed to be serious I was laughing because the white kid in the movie, Jason (Charlie Neal), was so horrible in acting.  He is doofy looking and doesn't seem to fit well with the movie.  Taye Diggs has a small role in the movie and everything was on Hill Harper's performance.  He did an excellent job with what was there and was the movie's star.

As for the movie itself.  It's not like a movie more as an afterschool special.  Everyone learns their lesson, everyone wins, and racism is beat.  I'm sorry, nothing is that picture perfect.  We all have reservations.  The portray of the ghetto is way out of the ordinary.  White cops stopping the white kid and no gang violence toward the white kid.  Just seems out of place.  It's more of a feel good movie and it shows because they gloss over the negative stuff very quickly.

I'd never heard of this movie before and at least got to experience it but it's overly bad.  Poor acting, bad storyline, and emotionless characters make this movie pure garbage.  If they would have had a bigger budget and better acters, maybe.  But of course that's a big maybe because the story itself was seriously flawed.",1172793600,2,1611,4.371621621621622
1549438,4,B00005JOXO,"Since I've hardly seen anything on this, I thought I'd share what I know.  I watched a few of the episodes one night on TV, and found them to be quite good.  They were roughly comparable to the quality and the tone of Morgan's original movie documentary on McDonalds, ""Supersize Me"".

These 1 hour episodes seemed to take care to be ""fair and balanced"", showing the given issue from multiple points of view, and stating empirical data -- to make the issues far more than the typical one-sided whining-fest so much of the ""news"" and ""news"" channel documentary shows offer these days. I was very pleasantly surprised how consistently this was done.

As soon as I saw these three episodes, I wanted to see them all, so I'm very glad to see that this DVD set is being released.  Note, I CANNOT attest to anything about he DVD quality, etc. at this point.  Once it's released on DVD and I get that information, I'll update this review, and change my star rating (conservatively set at 4 stars at this point), based on the DVD quality, any extra features, etc.  If all 8 (I think there are 8, could be more) episodes are of the caliber of the three I describe below, the content would get 5 stars.

The episode with Morgan Spurlock and his girlfriend trying to survive on a minimum wage income was very interesting.  They could have made it (barely) if they had no kids (actually, they have no kids, but they took in a couple of friend's or relatives kids, which resulted in a LOT of stress and spending in just 2 days) and never got sick.  Of course in the real world, that doesn't happen.  This dramatically shows the impact of modern medical costs to the poor.  It also shows how the stresses of true poverty can play havoc with relationships.  There were lots of good conversations and normal daily living issues that really brought the reality of miniumum wage living home.

Another episode was on the fad diet schemes we see so much advertising about, targeting the 30-something desk job person who is unhappy with their wasteline and physical condition since they lack time/energy to exercise. (This is NOT Morgan.  I think he may have only been on the episode above). It revealed how careful one must be when doctors who advocate such things as ""safe"" fast-weight-loss drugs and ""enhancers"" recommend their poisons (literally).  The medical, exercise, fitness consultant, family, psychology, dietary, and stress aspects of such a crash program are all considered from various viewpoints.  The conclusion makes lots of sense, given what transpired in the episode.

The third episode showed a ""typical"" actively practicing  American Christian young man living with a Muslim couple in Dearborn Michigan, which has a very large proportion of Muslims.  It shows him learning about the Muslim faith and practices from a Muslim point of view, gaining insight into some of the common roots of the Muslim and Christian religion (worshipping the same God, having the same basic starting point, etc).

I think for people with an open mind that are willing to try to understand others' point of view, this was rather enlightening overall.  (No, I'm NOT saying anyone is ""right"" here -- just willing to be open-minded, and not dislike someone merely because they are different).

Again, I can't speak to the actual DVD set or the other episodes, unfortunately, or even exactly how many there are -- but the quality, balance, and insightfulness of the three I had the opportunity to view (I think on FX on a Saturday evening) were enough to make me want to own the DVD set, view some of the episodes with friends and discuss, etc.",1147132800,,3618,4.7536

1549571,3,B00005JOXO,Early insight in the acting careers of Hil Harper and Taye Diggs - and story finished well with a profound message of how to win despite all the losing in Life and competitive games.,1416528000,,182,4.382352941176471

1549573,5,B00005JOXO,"It was predictable that the two main characters would end up friends and saving the day in the end, but getting there was a great ride. I love sports movies anyway so the basketball action didn't hurt at all. I really enjoyed it, especially the action on and by the court.",1414627200,,272,4.352941176470588

1549575,5,B00005JOXO,"This is a movie that should be mandatory in all schools. It addresses racial profiling, bullying, humanity, friendship, what you see is not the necessarily real or the complete story, Things children should be taught but are sadly, not. I saw so many lessons on so many levels that to list them is only my opinion so I truly hope that enough parents, teachers, coaches, and  people get the message. Sure would make the world a safer and better place to live in and love in. 30 Days is not enough. I needs to be a pattern for life.",1402012800,3,530,4.353535353535354
1549576,5,B00005JOXO,It is a very positive movie that helps young people not get involved with violence and let the authorities handle things even more though you are mourning someone special. You should never get involved in race wars because the other race that you don't like might turn out to be your best friend.,1394928000,,296,4.60377358490566
1549577,5,B00005JOXO,"Loved this movie and how it showed that color is nothing when it comes to hate,love, disease or a bullet. The message here is strong and Hill Harper did his thing. Look forward to seeing more movies by him.",1364342400,,206,4.3076923076923075
1549578,3,B00005JOXO,"Nobody would say this is a great movie.  However, it isn't as bad as some have made it out to be.  One reviewer said it has the feel of an 'after school special' [See: http://www.amazon.com/After-School-Specials-Rossie-Harris/dp/B0009WPLSK/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1247020636&sr=1-5 ], and I agree.  The theme of interracial friendship is especially interesting because the director, Jamal Joseph, is a former black panther (essentially, a black separatist who seems to have turned around while in prison for his black panther crimes).

My feeling was that this movie is like a lot of the so-called Christian movies - it seems to want to jam in too many 'lessons.'  Hence, not enough development is given to any aspect of the movie to create a strong impact.  A rifle shot is much more focused than a shotgun shot; this movie tends to take the shotgun approach (unlike the after school specials, which always had a single lesson to be learned).  There is a bit of bad language, but not nearly as much as most movies dealing with the inner city.  It may not be a movie to really seek out, but it is worth watching if one has the opportunity.",1246924800,2,1144,4.952879581151833

7941351,3,B00005JOXO,I only bought it because I heard Da Brat say she did the movie on The Rickey Smiley Morning Show. The acting is OK. The story just moves extremely slow.,1461888000,,152,4.1

7941353,4,B00005JOXO,"This was a good movie but not necessarily suitable for younger children.  There is some bad language in the movie (the F word, among a few others).  There is also a sexual scene later in the movie, which we fortunately were able to skip through.  I would recommend this movie for older children (middle school and older).  Movie has a good message of overcoming racism, and learning to accept and understand each other.",1430697600,,419,4.698630136986301

7941359,3,B00005JOXO,Good but preditable. It is like several similar stories about race relations understanding. There is a little Boyz in the Hood and Remember the Titans in it.,1426636800,,157,4.851851851851852
