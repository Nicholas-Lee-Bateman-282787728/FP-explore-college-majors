8603508,4,B000W1V5D8,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles (remember to turn it on in your settings).  Good sword fight choreography.  Story is about kung-fu masters who all want to rank the highest, except the highest ranking master known as the Third Master (aka Divine Sword) doesn't want the highest ranking and decides to disappear from the world of fighters by faking his death because he's tired of having to kill everyone who challenges him.  He has everything he wants, wealth, protection, an isolated mansion, reputation, etc., but he's willing to give them all up.  In his disappearance effort, he gives up fighting and roams the streets as a homeless man.  Soon, he's outside a brothel and a kind mute man who is a servant at the brothel offers to help by providing the master with food and temporary shelter.  The master earns his money at the brothel to pay back the mute and moves on.  Soon, he meets another poor man and is taken in by his family only to find that the man's sister works at the brothel, and a romantic relationship begins.  The bad guys wanting the sister as a companion for their party ends up at the poor man's home, and the poor man's mother is killed in their scuffle.  The master had no choice but to reveal his kung-fu skills.  With kung-fu masters everywhere in search of him, it's difficult for the Third Master to hide.  Everyone wants the wealth and reputation that the Third Master currently holds, so everyone wants what he doesn't want; it's an irony.  While everyone searches for the Third Master, all other masters all kill each other, including the people who help the Third Master. It seems everyone around him gets killed even though that is exactly the reason he avoids everyone.  He realizes that once someone has fame, it's no longer the person's choice to return to regular life.  When a person has everything, he doesn't appreciate the worth until he has nothing again.  When they kill the love of his life, that triggered him to return to his position to kill all those who challenge him.",1522195200,,2030,4.662921348314606

8603510,4,B000W1V5D8,"Subtitles are a little off, but who cares. Still a great movie. Awesome ending.

4.5 stars.",1512864000,,91,4.6875
8603511,5,B000W1V5D8,I've watched the remake Swordmaster before this but this one is by far more realistic. The love be story is written better in the newer version although its a drama/action preference. Seeing many shaw cameos just leaves a thought...CLASSIC!,1504569600,,240,5.17948717948718
8603512,5,B000W1V5D8,"For the 70's era, this is REALLY good. I like the story. The movie Sword Master (2016) is based on this movie. Which is really cool. After watching this movie, you should watch Sword Master. Both are VERY good!",1504051200,,210,4.410256410256411
8603513,4,B000W1V5D8,Great movie,1503792000,,11,5.0
8603514,5,B000W1V5D8,"Rare that I give 5s...  maybe this really should be a 4 or 4.5...  but for the genre ( old school martial arts ), it's up there as a classic...  the plot-line is sophisticated enough that there is some drama to be had without having 35 characters to try to follow...  the sword play / fights are pretty typical late 70s style, but done well...

If you are into 70s / early 80s martial arts flicks, I'm sure you'll enjoy this...  bottom line...",1502496000,,443,4.27710843373494
8603515,5,B000W1V5D8,"Man this movie is hot. I loved the scenery, choreography, story and the sword play. This movie is in my top 20 favorites right now. Derrick Yee did a great job. Any true collector (like myself) should have this in their collection. The story is consistent with many wuxia movies: The undisputed Greatest swordsman want's to retire and goes into hiding but other swordsman want to find him and fight him to make a name for themselves. Tragedy forces the greatest swordsman out of retirement. The only gripe is I paid too much for the movie lol. Live and learn.",1264550400,,559,4.6
