2703180,5,B000LC3IO2,"Totally amazing.  After doing the whole 30 minutes it felt like I'd had a head to toe massage.  The roller gets deep into the muscles and is incredibly effective at loosening the muscles and easing tension.  All the tension in my hamstrings, glutes and hip flexors is gone.  There are some good stretch DVD's out there but this one works like no other.  After using the DVD a few times you can do it on your own while you watch T.V. or play with the kids but it is worth getting the DVD for guidance.  Get the long roller as there are a few moves where the short one will not work.",1187654400,34,581,4.142857142857143
2703181,4,B000LC3IO2,"Keli Roberts is one of the best instructors.  She's brought us another great workout.  It's kind of unique because of the foam roller.  It massages almost all of your muscles (and some you didn't know you had) and it's very relaxing.  As you get rid of your knots, you are also becoming a little more flexible as it's great for helping you to improve your range of motion.  You can adjust the roller's position to get a deep tissue massage or gentle relaxation.

In this you'll work your abs and total core and feel really good afterwards.  It is about 30 minutes and so it's perfect for using at the end of a stressful day.  I'm loving mine and it will make a great treat for yourself or a friend because almost everyone can do this routine.",1179964800,19,742,4.364963503649635
2703182,5,B000LC3IO2,"Well, yummy if you like shiatsu, that is.  This is a 36 minute workout which can be split into 3 separate parts.  It uses a hard foam roller - and there is no way you can do this routine without it.....  It feels great.  Like deep tissue massage.  Lots of deep stretching, getting into the underarms and the sides of the hips and places you didn't even know were tight.  There's a little bit of core work thrown in, which is super tough because of the roller.  At least, i found it super tough.  But I haven't been doing enough pilates lately, so perhaps it isn't that tough.  Who knows?  Anyway, it's just enough to get you even more streightened out, and not that much that the routine feels like too  much work.  this is a good one for after weight workouts, or perhaps cardio, or for days when you don't have energy and want to do something.  I really like it.  Felt nicely wrung out after.",1173571200,41,894,4.275449101796407

8161186,3,B000LC3IO2,"I admit, my expectations for this were probably too high.  I became interested in foam rollers after going through physical therapy due to my osteoarthritic knees and pateller maltracking.  My therapist taught me the one for the I-band.  It made a world of difference for me, and if I had known about this a long time ago, I probably would have never had osteoarthritis or pateller maltracking (from all the running I did).  I got this DVD, to see what other great stretches I'm probably missing out on.  But in the video, when she goes over the I-band stretch, she admits that that's one of the best ones.  I completely agree.  None of the other stretches gave the same amount of comfort that that one brought.  Maybe if I didn't know about the I-Band stretch already, I might have been more pleased.  But then again, it's the I-Band stretch that drew me to this!",1421193600,,864,4.558441558441558
8161187,5,B000LC3IO2,use this after auto accident where I sustained serious fractures and injury.  It has helped me to have less pain and be more mobile.,1412553600,,132,4.5
8161188,5,B000LC3IO2,"Love the foam roller exercises. The demonstrations are easy to follow and I
felt so relaxed after doing the video. I am going to do this video at least once a week.",1399334400,,164,4.15625
8161189,1,B000LC3IO2,"This was a horrible DVD.  I really like Keli Roberts and own many of her workout tapes.  I was very disappointed in this.  There are 3 ""workouts"" each is about 3 - 5 minutes long.  The one for the glutes/hips only did the workout on one side.  You have to stop and go back to do the other side.  I don't know why they just couldn't continue.  The warmup is all of 1 minute long and accomplishes nothing.  So disappointed in this DVD.",1339632000,2,433,4.132530120481928
8161190,3,B000LC3IO2,"The video is a good foam roller stretching routine. However, there are no modifications for different flexibility levels. The title is a bit misleading in this respect. Otherwise an adequate foam roller workout.",1313366400,,211,5.424242424242424
8161191,2,B000LC3IO2,"Hopefully the new version has this corrected, but I purchased the orange-covered version in 2008. It holds potential, but when it was edited they completely skipped the stretches for the second leg.

If you google you will find other comments on this, so please be aware of that when looking at these DVDs.",1299110400,7,306,4.773584905660377
8161192,4,B000LC3IO2,"I think the video is very good, but there is not enough time to go from 1 exercise to the next if you are inflexible. It needs to give more time to do so.",1269734400,3,154,3.5588235294117645
8161193,5,B000LC3IO2,I'm the opposite of inflexible and use this DVD to help with myofascial pain and trigger points. It is a very intense DVD and helps with with tissue pain and fatigue.,1241308800,13,166,4.387096774193548
8161194,3,B000LC3IO2,"After reading the reviews, I was so excited to try this DVD.  Everyone said it felt like having a full body message.  Well, in reality, it actually kind of hurts while your doing it.  But afterward, I did feel pretty good and stretched.  The moves are all pretty easy so you probably only really need to watch the DVD a couple times to be able to do the excercises on your own.  Although, I must say trying to balance on the foam roller is challenging.  In addition, the film is short so you can do it in 20 minutes.  Good for after workouts to stretch....but by itself, it's not a good workout.",1213315200,9,595,4.258928571428571
