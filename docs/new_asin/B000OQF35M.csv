2799085,5,B000OQF35M,"A film that took twenty five years to plan, it was not until 2006 when major music label and entertainment company Avex Entertainment, Inc. along with producers Haruki Kadokawa (""Yamato"", ""Kamui no Ken"") and Katsuhito Matsuura took on one of most expensive and ambitious projects ever done by Japanese filmmakers.

The plan was to adapt Seiichi Morimura's historical fiction novel ""Chi hate umi tsukiru made: Shsetsu Chingisu Hn"" to film and for several months, in order to create this epic film, the needed to shoot in rural Mongolia, fly their talent and crew and make Mongolia almost like their second home for four months.

But that wasn't all, the film would then entail of having over a thousand crew members, over 27,000 extras and 5,000 Mongolian Army Soldiers involved and also to transport a large number of animals and to try and recreate this time from over 800 years ago into film.  To base this film around a warrior named Temujin also known as Genghis Khan, the conqueror of Asia.

Many of us know of Genghis Khan from books or films as having one of the largest contiguous empires ever created but knowing that he is also credited for unifying Mongolia and re-uniting China.

As many films have shown the war tactician and his conquering of lands,  ""GENGHIS KHAN: TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEA"" goes a different route.  This time humanizing the ruler by showing him as a son, a father, a conqueror and most importantly, a man who loves his country but wanted peace but in order to achieve piece, he had to unify all nomadic tribes in Mongolia.

Of course, because the film is an adaptation of a novel to film and there is only so much of that history of Genghis Khan that could be included, without complicating things, the factual and complex history (of what was recorded at that time) of Temujin and what is presented on the film is quite different.  But the film's true intention of showing what kind of man Temujin (Ghengis Khan) truly is, is the heart of what the film is all about.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""GENGHIS KHAN: TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEA"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (169).  The film was shot in Mongolia and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  The scenery is so beautiful as you see the clouds and mountains in the horizon that I had to rewatch several scenes to find out if they looked as if certain elements such as the background were added in post production but after watching the special features, you realize that these outdoor shots of Mongolia are as is.  Just a beautiful location and was absolutely moved by the cinematography.

Of course, to create something so epic with hundreds of warriors, there was a bit of post production in CG work to making the armies look so vast. But overall, the high definition transfer of the film was absolutely beautiful.  What was captured on film was definitely a sign of how large the production was for this film and how expensive and challenging it would be.

Overall, picture quality was well done and I found ""GENGHIS KHAN: TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEA"" to be a beautiful film.  Blacks are well done, I didn't see any scratches or dust or any major form of artifacting.  Absolutely beautiful picture quality!

As for the audio quality, I was quite surprised to hear my home theater setup being utilized.  From the drums to the armies moving, you hear the low rumbles through your subwoofer and also utilization of the rear channels during the action scenes as well.  The film utilizes a lot of dialogue but you do get a good sense of the action scenes through the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio (in Japanese).  For an epic film like this, I chose not listen to the Dolby Digital English dubbing via 2.0 channel at all.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""GENGHIS KHAN: TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEA"" features a good amount of lengthy special features which were presented in 480i Standard Definition and in Dolby Digital Japanese 2.0.  Special features included are:

JUDGMENT CALL:

I really enjoyed watching ""GENGHIS KHAN: TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEA"".  The film is so epic, well-written, well-acted and just beautiful to look at.

What is more interesting is that it's not solely an all Japanese film but a film that utilizes Asian talent for this large scale production.  The film is about unity and behind-the-scenes, various ethnicities united and gave their part for the creation of this epic film.

Japanese crew and talent teaming up with Mongolian crews and also utilization of Korean performer (and J-Pop singer) Mink and Korean commercial queen Ara, this was a production that I have not seen in this scale before.  I was very impressed with the final cut and then to watch all that transpired behind-the-scenes via the special features.

I first had the pleasure of learning about the film ""Aoki Okami"" (The Japanese title of the film) through my review of the CD single by Mink titled ""Innocent Blu~Chi hate umi tsukiru made"", the theme song for the film.  I was touched by the beautiful melody and how it showcased the female talent in Mongolia.  Beautiful cinematography and then it led to the two Japanese trailers for the film.

Immediately, I wanted to watch this film but because of its high level of Japanese dialogue, I knew that my knowledge of the Japanese language would not suffice in terms of  enjoying a film this epic in production without English subtitles.  Almost two years later, I was very happy to find out that FUNimation Entertainment would be releasing this film on Blu-ray and I absolutely loved the film!

With my review leaning towards the positive, I did find one negative.  The only thing that caught my attention immediately is how small the menu's were.  I have a 51' HDTV and this was the smallest type I have seen on a menu and had to use the back of the DVD case to read the menu.  But that was it.  Everything about the film and the Blu-ray coverage was absolutely positive.  As for others, perhaps those who want a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 English dub may have problems that they are getting a Dolby Digital English 2.0 track but I'm not the type to watch a Japanese live film with an English dub.  If anything, I was happy to find a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Japanese track.

I've only read about Genghis Khan in books and typically, those books tend to tell of his warfare intellect and his conquering of lands.  So, if anything, this film really opened my eyes to the human side of Temujin as a son, father, the leader and conqueror.  In the special features, even Mongolian and Japanese crews stated how they were glad to see a different perspective, a positive portrayal of their country's founder

I was amazed to see one of my favorite Japanese actors, Takashi Sorimachi in the lead role.  He definitely made the character of Temujin much more charismatic but well-liked.  In Mongolia, Genghis Khan is just revered as a national hero for his accomplishments and with so many films and books that described him as a deadly conqueror, the film portrays him with a man of faults but at the same time, ideals to unify the Mongols and what better to celebrate the 800th Year Anniversary of the founding of Mongolia through this film.

I felt that each talent from Mayumi Wakamura's Hoelun, Rei Kikuwa's bolte to Yusuke Hirayama's Jamuqa and Naoki Hosaka's Yesugei, each and every talent made this film feel quite special with their level of emotion and making us believe but also hooking us in with the beautiful cinematography, direction, storyline and the acting.

Typically when we think large scale Japanese films, we think of a classic like ""RAN"" and when you think of historical films, there have been quite a few produced in Korea and Hong Kong but to see a Japanese co-production with Mongolia utilizing so many people, staff and even animals, it was something I would never expect.

But I'm glad it did happen because ""GENGHIS KHAN: TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEA"" is one of those special films that manages to grab your attention and appreciate it.

And I have to admit, watching this on Blu-ray really made me enjoy this film much more.  Beautiful picture quality, clear and subwoofer trembling audio and lengthy special features definitely makes me give high recommendation for this Blu-ray release.  I can only hope that FUNimation Entertainment continues to bring more Japanese live-action films stateside.

2799089,3,B000OQF35M,"This Japanese production chronicles the rise of Genghis Khan (1162-1227), from his birth as Temujin, through his brutal adolescence in which his family was expelled from their tribe, to his eventual rise as the leader of Mongolia in 1206.  The film demonstrates his ability both as a warrior and a politician.  He was able to defeat many rivals and unify the warring tribes both by his military skill but also by his sense of justice.  The cinematography is outstanding, with sweeping scenes of the Asian steppes and massed cavalry battles.  What is missing is the sequel, and in this sense the title is somewhat misleading.  The film ends with the start of a military campaign against China.  After consolidating power, Genghis defeated the Jin Dynasty in northern China, and later went to war against the Khwarezmid Empire in modern-day Iran, destroying it completely.  Under Genghis and his successors, the Mongol empire rapidly expanded, and at its zenith in 1279, it covered much of Asia.  Although it was one of the largest empires ever built, it began to disintegrate as early as the 1300s. The more interesting story is what came later.",1421452800,6,1144,4.952879581151833

2799091,3,B000OQF35M,"I am usually very generous with my ratings , maybe I am just getting frustrated waiting for a movie worthy of Genghis Khan!!!  I realize this movie was made in an effort to humanize the legendary Warlord but it didn't even do that great a job at that! Other than mentioning that Genghis Khan was very open & tolerant of peoples religious belief's that lived under his rule the movie did nothing to show the huge advances in culture he brought to the Mongol people's!  I guess I would rather see the Chinese make a Genghis Khan movie. As far as humanizing him & the Mongol people's & staying true to history this may be difficult. These people's of the plains practiced head boarding & sported some rather unique hair styles atop there cone shaped heads! To the European peoples they were strange & terrifying in appearance to say the least. Genghis Khan earned that title by conquering more of the known world than Alexander the Great & not only did Genghis Khan unite the Hun's but a wide variety of peoples living on the Russian steeps. He defeated heavily armored Calvary with the use of the lasso, Bow & Bolo's. When I see movies like ""Red Cliff"" & ""The Warlord's"" & imagine the Huns going up against the Sarmatian Knights & Tar Tars, Avars, Alan's & all the way up into Europe absorbing the Iberian Celtic peoples into his army I can envision a vividly colorful & widely varying armor & peoples in his massive army. As well as plenty of interesting strategic battles!!! Genghis Khan lived & died in the saddle & as he marched a crossed the known world kicking butt they could have flashed back to his family & peoples showing how they were benefiting from the cultural knowledge he was sending back to his peoples, not many people realize how much the Mongol's benefited under Genghis Khans reign. To show the huge variety of people's that were absorbed into his army would have been visually stunning & the true events of his life would have made a super action packed movie!!!  Some day some one will do this right & the results will be one of the top 10 movies of all time!  But this isn't it!  If done right the first time you see the Huns on the screen they should seem like monster's & by the end of the movie when the aged Warrior king falls dead from his horse it should bring a tear to your eye! Because Genghis Khan was no more a monster to his people than Alexander the Great was to his. And in the free spirited way of the Hun's he brought them as much culture to his people as Alexander tried to give the rest of the world.",1418860800,4,2541,4.386411889596603

2799098,3,B000OQF35M,"There are more than a dozen films on Genghis already, so this one tried to present something different in order to be original. Note that the film is only available in Japanese with English subtitles. Unfortunately, it did not entirely work for me, and I will try to explain why in a moment.

The sceneries, the screenshot and the battle scenes are quite striking and beautiful, with masses of extras and thousands of soldiers of the Mongolian Army involved, as you could expect for a 30 million dollars film. However, and contrary to the advertising blurb, this is not ""the true story of Genghis Khan"". It is not even all of it. Instead, this is a mix of legends and interpretations which focus mainly on his early years and on his unification of the tribes to make the Mongols.

You get just nothing about the expeditions to the North and West, apart from a mention that Jochi, the eldest son of the Khan, was leading it. Even this is not quite true. Initially at least, Genghis did not let him go alone and had him accompanied by some of his most experienced generals. The film also stops just as the Mongols attack the Great Wall. So you have nothing about the first campaigns against China and nothing about the war against the Kwarizmian shah. Simply put, the last decade of the Conqueror's life is omitted. The conclusion here is that this is hardly the story of his life and conquests. Instead, it is the story of how he unified the Mongols.

Despite this, the film has quite a few other things going for it, although I found that it bordered on the melodramatic at times. It is essentially about Temudjin, rather than about Genghis Khan. It is about his sense of honour and loyalty, as how this fierce war leader triumphed despite being betrayed time and again. To a large extent, it is also about Temudjin, his family and his own traumas and fears. At times, you might have to suspend disbelief as the great hero becomes admired of all, and, apart from his love/hate relationship with his eldest son, seems to do no wrong. Even the story of Jochi is heavily adapted. He seems to have made a name for himself and does not seem to have been as young as shown in the film. There is also a rather different story about his death and a much less flattering one for his father although I will stop here to avoid spoilers.

Some of the characters, such as that of Borte (Temudjin's wife), and Qasar (his brother) are just as I would imagine them (which does not necessarily mean that they are perfectly accurate). The restraining influence of Qasar, in particular, is rather well shown. However, are Temudjin's two other surviving brothers (he murdered his elder brother) are absent from the script except at the very beginning. In fact, all three helped Genghis, with two of them commanding armies while the third one organised his supplies and logistics. Another missing character is that of Subotai, one of his most faithful and best generals, and we only get a glimpse at Jebe, who was another one of them.

Finally, even the battles were somewhat ""stylized"". You get multiple - and very impressive - scenes of cavalry charging against each other, but no sense of the strategies used and no indications as to why Genghis won, or lost, because, as shown in the film, he did lose. The point here is that the film is not really about the Conqueror. It is not about the military strategist, tactician and genius. It is about the man and the unifier of the Mongols. Maybe this was why I was disappointed, since I was led to expect something else. Three stars all the same...",1387065600,3,3576,4.58125

Japanese, with an unwarranted kinship to samurai epics. There's a lot of flags and swordplay that stylistically don't fit the subject matter. A much more authentic production is MONGOL on the same subject. But neither go very far in the career of Genghis Khan. Here he comes off as a sensitive, considerate kind of guy. You don't see any of the mass slaughter as he and his hordes moved west. Mostly what you have is the early Genghis, as he's starting out, his travails, up to the point where he begins his conquests.
