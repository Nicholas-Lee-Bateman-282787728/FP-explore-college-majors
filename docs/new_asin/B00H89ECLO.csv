8630772,1,B00H89ECLO,"The POV ""hangin' in Whistler"" scenes ruined it for me. As well as the crap hip-hop in the soundtrack. What happened to mountain bike films? Yes, I'm from the era of Roam et al; but those were truly inspirational. Quality soundtrack melded with supreme riding and excellent camera work. And deeper insights to local scenes around the world.

As an aside, am I the only one who is constantly annoyed to see dirt jumping in these films? For me that's not mountain biking; there's no mountain involved in a dirt jump park. If I want to see flips and spins I'll go watch a ballet.

Kudos to Clay Porter for remaining dedicated to the downhill scene and keeping us inspired to ride harder, faster, and longer.",1406419200,2,703,4.571428571428571
8630773,5,B00H89ECLO,"This movie is so sick. It inspires me to ride harder and take better pictures everyday. These dudes have created not only made a badass mountain biking video at every major shred location, they've made a really stunning film for the lay person to watch",1394841600,,252,4.622222222222222
8630774,2,B00H89ECLO,Too short only 45 minutes long and not enough variety of riding styles. Could have been much better a little disappointed,1394409600,,121,4.809523809523809
8630775,1,B00H89ECLO,"There was some great cinematography in the Arrival.  The camera work was, indeed, amazing.  The movie was marred, however, by time-wasting scenes of drunken stupidity...  Is this what I paid my money for?  I can see that every day without having to pay for it.  The big issue for me was the fact that the movie was nothing but a thinly veiled ad for Specialized, Santa Cruz & Power Bars.  OK, I realize that they are sponsors (companies who would rather throw cash at sponsorships & ads than to provide true innovation in their products) & they should get something for their money...  However, I have nearly 20 cycling movies & this was the worst.  Every jump, every drop, every railed corner was just an opportunity for the camera to zoom in on a product logo on the bike's frame.  The riders were not even the focus of the shot.  The gratuitous shots of riders eating Power Bars on the chair lifts was laughable.  By the end of the movie I was so pissed-off that I was not even watching it.  The DVD went up for sale on E-Bay minutes later.  Do yourself a favor, spend your cash on an older movie that pretends to focus on the riding.",1391558400,4,1137,4.382775119617225
