Okay, I was all set to give this the standard Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie review, but then I got to the wasp zombies.

Yes, you heard me correctly, the wasp zombies. How can any movie that has wasp zombies in it not be one of the coolest things ever? In a cheesy, horrible sort of sense, of course.

The plot: Jane Kozik (Secret Window's Sarah Allen) moves back to the rural town of Black Stone, NY with her daughter Kelsey (Rebecca Windheim). She'd left for Manhattan ten years earlier after a traumatic event which the first half-hour of the movie takes great pains to mask, so I won't mention it here. Just after they get to town, Kelsey meets the sinister Beekeeper, Eli (Robert Englund, who should need no introduction), who seems crabby, but not an especially bad sort. Meanwhile, the local exterminator, Devin Hall (Sebastien Roberts), goes to check out an infestation of bees in the tool shed of Beverly Rowe (Abandon's Sheena Larkin), the town blind-grandmother-ly type. He doesn't find much, but as he's pulling out the wall, something flies out and smacks into the lightbulb. (This should really have made him wonder later on in the film, but no.) He finds nothing, but a vagrant who breaks in looking for a place to sleep that night finds something. Oh, yes. Yes, he does. Anyway, there's some sort of history between Devin and Jane. Cue silly romance subplot, but there's a catch-- after the vagrant's death, the town coroner calls in Katherine Randell (Jayne Heitmeyer), an entomologist from a nearby university. Who happens to be quite attractive. And quite forward.

I have to say, there's not a great deal to recommend this flick to people who aren't diehard fans of the Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie. I mean, come on, how many killer-insect movies have you seen? And how many of them have been on the Sci-Fi Channel? This one's about the same, with bad science, bad acting, bad sound, pretty much bad everything. In other words, it's your standard Sci-Fi Channel Movie.

But, you know, WASP ZOMBIES. **",1227052800,10,2057,4.783098591549296
8315139,4,B001KKU9AK,"They sure expected a lot of Robert Englund, hoping that he would provide the one saving grace in this awkward hybrid of killer bug movies and zombies who aren't really zombies, just buzz-heads.  The back-story has more than its fair share of melodrama.  A widow returns to her small town as the new deputy sheriff.  Shes not overly anxious to run into her brother-in-law who is the identical twin of her dead husband, who was actually her second choice because she left the other twin at the alter.  Meanwhile!  Theres a scientist (Robert Englund) who has a ginormous lab in the cellar of his trailer!!!  He created genetically modified wasps as a weapon for the military.  The problem is........these nutty wasps cant tell the difference between friend or foe, which pretty much makes them useless.  Enter a highly suspicious blonde pretending to be a bug expert (meaning shes a killer for hire, working for the government).  Its a race against time to destroy the nest before everyone in this small town ends up zombie-fied by a gut full of wasps.

This movie has a certain charm in that it is so terrible its actually very entertaining.  I quite liked it.",1476576000,,1158,4.74

8315141,3,B001KKU9AK,This is another monster movie from the 'Maneater Series' and if you've seen any of these you'll know what to expect. This one is about genetically engineered wasps and while the idea is OK the implementation was a bit weird. I get that you might change the wasp genes and make them more dangerous but it went one step further and if you got stung you became a 'drone' (zombie like) which somehow brought you back to life. This was never explained properly and the idea was only used sporadically throughout the film - note that this is NOT a zombie film. But what really bothered me was the pseudo love story that ran along with the monster story - the heroine married a twin who was subsequently killed by wasps. She is pregnant and leaves town then comes back 10 years later. And of course the other twin is still there. And then there is the obvious question about who fathered the child. I have no idea what the producers were thinking - this whole storyline is particularly creepy and tasteless. But if you can ignore this aspect and just go with the story you might be entertained for 90 minutes. This one does have a 5.1 audio track which gives you some sense of wasps swarming and a few other effects.,1451520000,,1209,4.426008968609866

I am a huge fan of Robert Englund so anything he is a part of I have to have, so after having a little Robert kick this past weekend watching films like Fear Clinic and The Last Showing which are his most recent releases I had to go back and watch this Maneater series film. It had been a long time since I popped this in and kicked back, so I continued the marathon.

The film follows a woman who is returning to her home town as a deputy sheriff after her husband and father of her child died. Also in town and looking to leave it is her ex and late husbands twin brother. It just so happens that he is really needed by the town as a swarm of killer wasps of started attacking people, killing them at first only for them to become zombie like creatures. Since he is an exterminator he has never been needed more. Also the town beekeeper is acting very strange what does he know about all of this?

Now you should know that this is one of those B movies that you will either love or hate, it premiered on the SyFy channel so if you dislike those this is not for you. The film was directed by David Winning who also directed another Maneater series flick called Swamp Devil, in fact one of the writers returned with him to write that film, Ethlie Ann Vare. The other writer here is Todd Samovitz and I think he and Vare should work together again because this movie is hilarious. I don't know if it was intentional but my brother and I laughed hard during this flick.

There were lines that had us rolling but most of it came from the acting or lack thereof. There is some good acting here, Englund, but there is a lot to be questioned, great B level stuff that lovers like us truly enjoy. Also I liked the little Elm Street thing as a nod to Robert. It is that stuff that just made this a super fun movie to watch again. I just wish we would have a commentary or something with this flick or even a behind the scenes feature. Anyway this is a funny flick that I am sure wasn't intended, but then again maybe it was.",1428278400,2,2029,4.1421319796954315

8315147,5,B001KKU9AK,Thanks so much.,1407283200,,15,4.333333333333333
8315148,3,B001KKU9AK,"I fell in love with Black Swarm just from the description. Who wouldn't? It is about mutated wasps that kill the people they sting and turn them into zombies. It is combining two classic B horror tropes in one movie! Awesome! Throw in the massively talented Robert Englund and how can you go wrong? You can't, right? Wrong.

All along through this movie, there is heavy need to suspend your disbelief. After all, this is B horror at its finest. Even with that I found the movie enjoyable - until the last 25 minutes. The first hour is a fine little B horror classic complete with creepy guy with a heart of gold, long lost lovers reunited, and curious little girl getting into trouble. There are a lot of genre classics there, but they are classics for a reason. I was floating along... until the last 25 minutes.

MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!

In the last twenty five minutes, there is even more of the mash up of every horror movie ever, but the quality of writing takes a nosedive. If the first hour were the only basis for my review, I would give the movie 4 stars. The last bit gets 2 stars if I am being generous, 1 star if I am not. It's killing me to not be able to tell you why the writing got bad, but I can't without giving away one of the `twists' of the movie. The biggest problem is that if you have ever watched a horror movie, you can guess how this will end a thousand miles away, complete with the `happy ending/OMG! They missed one and now it will start again!'. The whole thing killed my soul a little.

BACK TO THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED REVIEW

I like the concept of this movie, and I like some of the elements. The little CGI wasps are actually kind of cute. But, this movie is definitely something to have on while you are doing a project and can divide your attention. Just enjoy the movie's potential and some of the elements but understand the end might just give you a headache.

But watch it anyway, so you can say you watched a movie about mutant wasps that make zombies.",1366934400,2,1993,4.315508021390374
