8703805,2,B00U1FWA98,"This video packing is misleading, it states ""Senior"" and has a picture of a older person, however, the workouts are with Jon and another young man using some devices most senior would not use. Although some of the workout steps are slow, it's dual, there's no nice or lively music. They should have offered a preview before purchase. I would not recommend this product. I wish I could get my money back.",1435363200,2,403,4.611111111111111

8703807,5,B00U1FWA98,"This is a great way to workout. They give very detailed instructions and explanations for each exercise. They also make sure to emphasize the importance of staying hydrated, and to do what is reasonable for your range of motion. This is a great way for beginners and those who haven't exercised for a while to get back in the game and start to see results.",1425859200,4,356,4.492307692307692
