1400574,5,B000056VYM,"Not only have I seen this video, I've seen Barrage live on stage a couple of times (seeing them once is not enough).  Barrage is amazing...the music will capture you (they play all kinds...you'll even like the stuff you wouldn't normally listen to), and the choreography will leave you breathless (how DO they play violins while jumping around like that?).  The fun the group has playing ""Old Joe Clark"" and ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" is contagious, and the moving melodies of ""Mountain Spring"" almost brought me to tears remembring a time gone by.  If you get this DVD, you won't be disappoinetd.",980899200,8,589,4.811881188118812
1400575,5,B000056VYM,"I owned a VHS tape of this first. It was so good I knew I would want to keep it for life so searched for and bought 2 copies of the DVD to make sure I would always be able to watch it when I felt like it. Hmmm, I think I'll go watch it again right now. Well worth purchasing.",1344556800,,275,3.5245901639344264
1400576,5,B000056VYM,"How I love this DVD!  Wonderful music, vibrant energy, definitely one of a kind! I keep several copies in my music studio.",1316304000,,122,4.545454545454546
1400577,5,B000056VYM,My mother and I seen this concert on a television station. It was impossible to find in stores. I ordered this for her for mothers day and also one for myself. I had the date of the approximate arrival of the DVD's. They actually arrived much sooner. Both DVD's were in excellent condition.,1277337600,,290,4.490566037735849
1400578,2,B000056VYM,"I've seen them live. I thought this would be a good DVD for my strings classes. The students lost interest quickly, unlike when other students have seen them live.  I think the DVD needs to be redone. I don't recommend it.",1270684800,,222,4.414634146341464
1400579,5,B000056VYM,"It is a really nice performing-no rock but really nice music and funny dancing.

Simply pleasure!",1213142400,3,97,5.0625

1400581,4,B000056VYM,"I first found Barrage preforming at Disneyland, back in the day when there was a canadian cast and a europe cast.  Disneyland had the Euro cast and was selling the dvd of the canadian cast.  Eventually the Canadian cast was at Disneyland too (they groups merged into one).  This DVD just barely touches on the talents and show of this group!  They have such great chemistry together than not only are they showing of their musical talents, but their great skill.  In the DVD you see them Dancing while playing the violin accurately.  Live goes even beyond that. I highly recommend this DVD and I hope to get Vagabond tales soon.  If you get a chance to see them live, do it!",1140998400,,674,4.475409836065574
1400582,3,B000056VYM,"This is not a knock on the talents of the violinists/fiddlers that make up the group Barrage.  Make no mistake about it:  they are all top-notch violinists, and could all make a go of it in most symphony orchestras.  However, their talent doesn't make the whole Barrage concept any less derivative.

Obviously, the producers of Barrage are looking to cash in on the whole ""Riverdance"" craze.  Hey, Riverdance with fiddles!  What's not to like?  Make sure everybody is pretty --- the girls must be well-endowed with pouty lips, and the guys should have that faux-scruffiness that is so en vogue these days.  And there you go.

The only problem is, it leaves the whole production with a forced, pre-fabricated quality, as though everything was run past a focus group before it made it into the final program.  Everything seems so calculated for effect, and one cannot help but feel that one has seen this all before.  The spontaneity so necessary in the creative process just seems not to be present.  It isn't terrible --- it's just sort of blah...",1124323200,2,1047,4.787709497206704
1400583,4,B000056VYM,"I saw Barrage live as the entertainment at an international business convention.  The DVD is a great representation of the talent of the band members and the energy they bring to the stage.  As far as features go, it's an unexceptional DVD.  Buy it for the music and show - not for any extras.",1100217600,3,293,4.388888888888889
1400584,5,B000056VYM,The talent of Barrage is amazing - the presentation is original.  I hope to see more.,1058313600,,85,4.3125
1400585,2,B000056VYM,Barrage will end up in my garage. There was no variety in their presentation. I loved the music but the stage show was extremely unoriginal. I felt cheated because the excitement displayed on the DVD cover was misleading.,1030838400,3,221,4.842105263157895
1400586,5,B000056VYM,"I had the great fortune to see Barrage in concert last winter, and I was totally blown away by their high-octane performance. Made up of eight Canadian violinists/dancers/vocalists and additional musicians on percussion and bass, Barrage is brimming with youthful energy. Their music is a blend of Celtic, folk, Eastern, and big band swing, and the eight performers also sing and dance while fiddling.  A blend of Riverdance and Stomp, the concert is interspersed with comments by the various performers. The projected backgrounds are vivid and Celtic-inspired, reminding me once again of Riverdance.
Although the DVD label claims that there is a documentary and biography, both claims are misleading. There is a short promo for *a* documentary, and a very brief biography of the band in general. Barrage: The World on Stage is perfect for aspiring stepdancers, fiddlers, violinists, and anyone who loves Celtic music and a rowdy good time (think Canadian family group Leahy).",1026086400,4,976,5.296774193548387
1400587,5,B000056VYM,"Barrage was a perfect Christmas present for me! I watch it any time I need insporation to play my violin when I don't really want to. It was very well done.
The only thing that irritated me, was the noticable 'little relationship' between two of the performers. You don't notice it when you first watch it because you're so entranced by the whole sensation. But I guess that's their decision, not mine.
Another thing is there is one really dumb song that one of the male performers sings. It's called 'Paralyzed' Even the violin in it wasn't that great. I always skip that one.
I rated it 5 stars for the other creative songs. It was great! I recommend it!",1012003200,2,656,4.475
1400588,4,B000056VYM,"Barrage puts on a powerhouse of a show that will get your hands clapping and your feet tapping.  The performers are very gifted, and it's clear that they love performing for an audience. This is a show you'll want to view again and again.
The DVD is a great addition to anyone's collection, but don't be mislead by the label.  It says that the DVD contains two bonus features: ""Documentary"" and ""Biography"".  It actually contains neither.  The ""Documentary"" is a documentary PROMO that gives just a couple minutes worth of the actual documentary of their tour of Europe.  Presumably the real documentary will be available as a separate title in the future. The ""Biography"" is just a few static screens that tells nothing about the individual members of the group; it's really more about the production company...",1003536000,8,812,4.897810218978102
1400589,5,B000056VYM,"In the lineage of ""Stomp"", ""Blue Man Group"" and ""Blast"", this group of talented violinists, guitarist, percussionists, and bassist are breaking new ground with the use of the violin.  The music is stunning, and their personalities are enchanting.  It is really wonderful to see excellent musicians having a great time making music.  I use this as a teaching tool for my elementary music classes, and the students love it!!!!  The guitarist is phenomenal and the selection of music is perfect.  Own this, you won't be sorry!",988588800,11,523,5.034883720930233
1400590,5,B000056VYM,"This video was made in December 1999 of this ensemble on stage in Calgary and was the program aired on PBS during their last pledge drive. An unusually electric sound led by violinists who are not only accomplished musicians, singers and dancers but PERFORMERS who obviously enjoy blending these skills simultaneously into a stage presence that exceeds ""outstanding.""
They enjoy performing their eclectic musical selections in a frenzied orgy of celebration as only possible when such talent performs for its own amusement. Like sitting in on an intimate jam-session.
A Canadian ensemble that plays Global-Music from varied cultures in a manner that introduces the listener to the pulse of humanity without being pretentious or self-conscious. Must be seen and heard by those who enjoy lifting their spirit beyond the mundane. Will make your pants want to get up and dance!
Get up, I mean get ""down"" and get this one!!",985305600,7,918,5.126666666666667
1400591,5,B000056VYM,"The first thing to catch my ears while watching/listening to this video was a number early on which featured lots of percussion and a wierd Buddhist-monk-like chant undercurrent in the music.  From there on I was completely hooked on this group's extremely energetic (super-charged) and highly eclectic mix of music.  Although there're lots of violins (I stopped counting at 11!)the music's not at all stuffy, concert-like or orchestral - and having all the violins also doesn't overpower the musical numbers - which run the gamut from an Irish jig to a medley of 40's tunes.  I understand that this group is extremely popular in Europe and their native Canada - and I also saw their show recently on a PBS fundraiser - my advice is to try and catch a re-run on your local PBS station if you're doubtful - but if you like a wild ride with violins and percussion - and if your tastes in music run somewhere between Enya and Stomp, this group's CD and video is for you!",984268800,12,967,4.6104651162790695
1400592,5,B000056VYM,"I was unlucky enough to hear Vanessa Williams( sorry, van... too many uh's and oh's) as a keynote speaker at our state music teacher conference but LUCKY enough to hear the following act BARRAGE. Those of us(which included mostly non-string teachers)contentedly not familiar with this group had no idea what we were in for. WHAT A FORCE!!!  As a musician/actor, it was so wonderful to see and hear real MUSICIANS exhibiting the total musicianship that we teachers have been striving for. My students were stunned by the fact that these people could sing/dance/act/play equally  well.  Isn't this what we are trying to teach? A great investment for a music teacher!!!!",984096000,5,667,5.045454545454546
