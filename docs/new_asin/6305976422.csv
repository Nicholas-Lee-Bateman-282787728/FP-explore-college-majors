1109320,2,6305976422,"This movie was clearly conceived while heavily medicated.  The story was silly at best, only out done by the acting and costume choices.
OK.. so we know story is not key to a rock-n-roll dream killer, B-movie.  It is the gore, suspense, and lovely ladies.  So how did it do on these fronts?
For gore, the movie did OK.  It is part of the driller killer series, so most of the action takes place as the rotating spear comes crashing through people's chests.
Suspense... come on...  he is a rock-n-roll guy with a drill on his guitar.
The ladies...  While they are certainly mostly cute, I don't think it was quite enough to make the movie a repeat watch.",1082073600,4,653,4.445378151260504
1109321,5,6305976422,"I orginally discovered this classic in the very back of the horror section of my local video store. Truth be told, it was only one video casette away from being in the porn section. Because it looked delightfully bad, and had about an inch of dust on the cover, I decided to give it a rent.
I watched it with another bad movie fanatic, and this fit the description of the perfect movie with no problems. Maybe it was the fact that I hadn't seen the first movie, or the fact that the writers were severely mentally handicapped, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out why the ghost of a 50's rock star (wearing mismatched leather no less) would want to kill a group of topless teenage girls with a giant drill somehow connected to an electric guitar.
Another favourite scene of mine involves death by acne. One of the central characters is actually engulfed by a rapid growing zit, until it pops all over the protagonist and she is presumed dead - that is until she walks through the front door about 10 minutes later. This, of course, set up the perfect reason for the police to ignore the phone calls of the teens when they were ACTUALLY being killed by a psychotic ghost, they just couldn't be fooled into believing a story like that AGAIN.
This movie never seems to loose it's lack-luster charm, and I have actually rented it several times since the innitial discovery, Every time I watch it, I discover a new layer of cheese that I can make jokes about to no end. For instance, the premis of the weekend is for the all female 80s punk band to practise for a big show, and everytime they pick up a guitar, it sinks into psudo music video shots of them rocking it out, and them playing in the pool, and them having their three millions topless pillow fight of the evening, and then when the song is over, they're right back to where they were at the beginning with their untouched instruments in front of them.
Forgive me for using the title of this review as a summary to review it, but this movie is most definately total crap, but I LOVE IT! This ranks right up there with the ultimate cliche movies of the eighties, such as Little Darlings. I have to say, I'm surprised this series doesn't have as much of a cult following as it should. If this were created and released intentionally, it would be reveared as a masterpeice, but because it wasn't, I have to say that it belongs on the very back shelf where I found it.",1076025600,14,2429,4.376106194690266
1109322,3,6305976422,"I'm a big fan of the first. I first saw this one. Then the first. Then the last. Needless to say, like many others- is my least favorite of the series.
Remember Courtney Bates? Sure you do. She was the only ""sane"" (I differ on that a lot) survivor of the first. No, she didn't go to the party, but she was being babysat that night by sister Valerie. who is now in an asylum. Well, every night, Courtney has bad dreams about Valerie telling her not to have sex the upcomming weekend and not to leave home. Strike one-Courtney is going up to bandmate Sheila's condo to practice with the rest of the group. A group of local boys crash the party (just like part 1) and it seems that Courtney is still having these dreams. Now, they are about the reincarnation of the original killer. But he is going to be reincarnated as an evil Elvis-type rocker. Suddenly, Courtney is starting to have daydreams about him and she tries to warn everyone but it's too late. The killer has returned to kill them all with his drill.....
I disliked a lot about this one. The fact that the killer cracks jokes and comes out of Courtney's dreams is a little too Nightmare on Elm Street-ish for me. And that the killer breaks into song as he's doing his ""thang"" was annoying.

1109323,3,6305976422,"This movie had too much foreshadowing (of a not so subtle variety).  It spent the first 50 minutes trying to be artsy or something -- I am not sure what their intent was.  This is a slasher movie.  We know that some guy is going to go nuts and kill people.  We don't really want a ""buildup"" to what we came for.
After you pay your dues with the first 50 minutes, you get another 25 minutes or so (yeah, it is only 77 minutes long, thank goodness!) of killing and mayhem.  Not the greatest killing spree I have ever seen, but passable.  The driller killer comes back as an evil rock star who looks kinda like George Michael and sings Elvis-like songs.  He has a really cool evil guitar with a huge drill bit at the tip (also evil).
Oh yeah, the cover looks pretty nice, eh?  Yeah, not in the movie.  The cool guitar and evil George Michael was in there, but the scantily clad women weren't.
This was an OK slasher movie, but you can do better.  Try the first in this series or Sorority House Massacre II instead!",1008374400,,1011,4.21875
1109324,5,6305976422,"This is one wildly entertaining ride!  That rock and roll killer, well, rocks!  The inexplicability surrounding the film's plot is an added bonus.  The lack of explanation makes the horror all the more disturbing.  A must see!",980035200,3,226,5.027027027027027
1109325,2,6305976422,"Bad horror movies have a certain charm all their own, as do T&A movies (the two commonly go hand-in-hand).  Either way, you won't find what you're looking for here.  This film doesn't manage to pull off that magic 'cheese factor' that can make a bad horror movie good, and just ends up falling flat.  I'll give it an extra star for a few clever bits, and Crystal Bernard fans might get a kick out of seeing her in an EARLY role, but that's about it.",972345600,,449,4.258823529411765
1109326,2,6305976422,"Slumber Party Massacre II just doesn't work, the producers obviously tried to be a little different with this follow up to the original drive in classic, but SPM II fails to live up to its predecessor. One of the survivors of the first film, Courtney who is now in high school dreams of the driller killer returning to butcher her.  When her and a group of friends escape to a parent's summer home for a weekend of sex and rock 'n roll, the driller killer comes out of Courtney's dreams and begins killing again.  This time he's a 50's rocker with a big drill extending from his guitar...pretty silly stuff.  Instead of another riff on Halloween, which was what the first Slumber Party Massacre did, part II veers into A Nightmare on Elm Street territory with some truly strange moments (a girls head turning into a giant zit).  The killer is really annoying as he dances around singing and prancing before he kills.  The guy looks as if he's doing a bad John Travolta from Grease.  Of course, all of this sounds like it could be fun, it just isn't.  It's terribly pedestrian and uninspired.  Even the gore and nudity are kept to a minimum. Slumber Party Massacre II has a lot wrong with it and not much good about it, even at 75 minutes, this one seems a bit long, the killer dosn't show up until the last twenty minutes and before that, there's hardly anything besides a scantly clad pillow fight to maintain interest.

7899426,4,6305976422,"1982's ""Slumber Party Massacre"" was a delicious piece of sexy, gory slasher trash from the tail end of the original era that would prove to become a hit on subsequent after-dark cable TV showings.

It's only natural then that there would be a follow-up, and five years later there was, in the form of 1987's ""Slumber Party Massacre II.""

During the five year interim, the traditional slasher movie template had undergone something of a facelift, with movies like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984), ""Sorority House Massacre"" (1986), along with the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels from this time all leaning increasingly toward the area of dreams and the supernatural for their subject matter.

Deborah Brock's ""Slumber Party Massacre II"" follows in those movies' footsteps in that it casts the youngest survivor from the first flick Courtney (here played by Crystal Bernard), five years older and in a high school rock band, and also having weird dreams.  She forgoes a weekend of visiting her older sister Valerie (also played by a different actress in this film), who is now in a mental institution from scars sustained from the events of part one, in favor of a drunk excursion in partying with her bandmates and their bonehead boyfriends.  Courtney incidentally has yet to ""go all the way"" with anyone, but keeps being haunted by said dreams of a macabre, leather clad rock 'n' roller who makes wisecracks while killing the teens with the huge drill bit that emerges from his electric guitar.  Almost like a rock 'n' roll Freddy Krueger in other words.

I had a lot of fun with this one.  A lot of the draw here is on the strength of main player Crystal Bernard, not only her acting ability, but also her irresistible good looks.  There's not one scene here where she doesn't don the most adorable, sweet innocent smile.  Very easy on the eyes indeed.  She doesn't bare any actual skin in this film, but one of her bandmates does, in a sexy pillowfight the girls have after drinking champagne straight out of the bottle and in general letting loose and going crazy.  I'm not saying ""Slumber Party Massacre II"" can be considered a serious piece of film making, but any movie that depicts cute, half-undressed girls having a pillowfight is most likely worth seeing if you ask me.

And just like in the first installment, the gore does not disappoint, and in particular the grinding drill bursting forth through the chests of two (male) victims.  As far as killings, this one does take awhile to get going but once it does, there is a fair amount of carnage to be had.

In all, this succeeds on the fun factor alone, and brings you back to an affluent, pre-recession Reagan era American setting of the late '80s, quite vintage.  Girls gone wild in other worlds with a killer on the loose.  Recommended for fans of the series who will enjoy a different take on it.",1290729600,2,2856,4.725806451612903
7899427,1,6305976422,"The original slumber party massacre was a pretty decent little horror film. You had the same stereo-typical characters as in other films, a killer, and some kill scenes. The killer was pretty creepy. They didn't give you a reason for his rampage, but doesn't that make it all the more creepy? Yeah, it was an I am woman here me roar movie, but all in all not bad.

 When you rent a sequel to a horror movie, you expect

basically the same things as the first one. I mean, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm, the characters and subtleties change, but the story remains the same. The ""same"" can not be said for Slumber Party Massacre 2.

When I watch a horror movie I always look for three things. First, is the film well made? You can have a great story line, and a great killer, but if it looks crappy, and the acting is terrible, it's not enjoyable to watch. Second, are the death sequences believable? They should be kind of gross, and have just the right amount of blood that makes you make that ""eww..."" face. Finally, does it end well?

First, Slumber Party Massacre 2 or SPM2 looks well made. I must say it looks much better than the first one. The acting is also much better. Crystal Bernard is a beautiful woman and a pretty good actress. She brought something special to the movie. The other girls are pretty typical, but good for a horror movie. The camera work is great, looks professional, and the script is tolerable.

Where this movie faulters is the death sequences. It's not the deaths persay, it's the killer. In the first one you had a guy with a portable power drill. Pretty cool (althought the drill was a symbol for something else.....ahem.....I am woman, hear me roar...) In this movie you have a guy with a drill strapped to the endo of his electric guitar. He runs around with his guitar, singing incredibly bad versions of 1950's hop music. You know ""Go greased lightning....go greased lightning""???? Well yeah, it's that bad. I thought I rented a horror movie, not Grease 3. Because of this, there's really no tension here, you just laugh for the first 30 seconds and then hit fast forward. The only really terrifying thing, is the fact that you actually paid money for this....

Third is the ending. Yeah, it's not bad. It wraps things up, and it's nothing you can't see coming. But once again, the ending is killed by the 6 minute 50's rock chase sequence.

All in All, I thought it was pretty bad. You watch these types of movies because they are so bad...they're good. But this one is just plain bad.",1167350400,2,2540,4.506521739130434
7899428,2,6305976422,"I double whammied myself last night with this film, Slumber Party Massacre II (1987), and the sequel titled Slumber Party Massacre III (1990).  Why would I subject myself to so much bad cinema in one heaping, steaming, oozing dose?  Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I suppose...now I've seen the first film, and it actually wasn't too bad (it wasn't all that great, either), but the sequels, this one in particular, were pretty crummy, which is annoying to me because the bar really wasn't set that high.  Written and directed by Deborah Brock (Rock 'n' Roll High School Forever), the film stars Crystal Bernard (Young Doctors in Love), whom many may remember from the television series ""Wings"", along with a slew of TV movies.  Also appearing is playmate Kimberly McArthur (Young Doctors in Love), Juliette Cummins (Friday the 13th: A New Beginning), Heidi Kozak (Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood), and Joel Hoffman (Pumpkinhead).

In this second installment in the series, sprite-like Bernard plays the role of Courtney, the annoying younger sister (now all grown up) to the character of Valerie, both of whom managed to survive the first film (Bernard did not appear in the first film...the role of Courtney was played by another `actress').  Apparently Val hasn't done so well, and now resides in on a koo koo farm (she's koo koo for Cocoa Puffs, among other things), while Courtney, who lives with their mother, got off a little better, suffering the occasional nightmare tied to her ordeal.  As the film begins we see her in bed, having a dreamy fantasy about a shirtless, hunky dingus (we later learn his name is Matt), which is then interrupted by visions of the driller killer (scenes from the previous movie are shown, basically as filler to pad out the film).  Anyway, when Courtney and her friends are perpetrating their act as the world's oldest high school students (Bernard was about 26 at the time she appeared in this film), they're part of some lame, Bangles-esque rock band with champagne dreams of hit albums and music videos (keep dreaming girls, cause your faux musicianship suck-diddly-ucks).  Around this time we find out Shelia (Cummins), whose the lead singer, has access to a condo, one her father recently purchased, and the girls are planning to go up for the weekend to practice, and perhaps party (I'm using party as a verb here, a usage which I normally loathe, but I'm trying to stick to the mentality of the characters).  Some lame and forgettable sequences follow, followed by an all too brief topless scene, right about the time two boyfriends show up, allowing for them to peep through the window for a view of some pitiful skin...lovely...do all the guys in these films have to be portrayed as creepy, voyeuristic perverts?  Seems the gang's all here, and things are going well, except for the fact Courtney's a real poison pill as her nightmarish visions are becoming more and more realistic, to her at least (severed hand in her burger, blood pouring from the bathtub faucet, violent poultry products) often featuring a greasy 50s style rock and roller, clad in leather, sporting a vicious looking geetar complete with giant, spinning drill bit...bruther...not content to exist in Courtney's dreams, evil Fonzie comes to life and begins thin out the cast (thankfully)...

Probably the one thing that will annoy many fans of the genre is actually having to wait a full 51 minutes before the first kill...which, by the way, was actually a pretty decent one, if you dig on that kind of thing.  Why do we have to wait so long?  I haven't the slightest idea...it's not like anyone watches a film like this for character development or intricate storylines.  The rest of the kills are middling to poor, but do involve a decent amount of hemoglobin spillage.  And in case you're wondering, Bernard does not bare any skin (I didn't think she would).  There was only one instance of skinnage (from Cummins), and it was pretty unspectacular.  You know, one of the draws to a movie like this is the scantily clad/soon to be nekkid females, of which the film was sorely lacking.  Surprisingly, the one person I expected to get nekkid, that of former playmate Kimberly McArthur, didn't, which was a real shame as I `googled' images of her (try it, it's fun!) revealing she had a most spectacular body at the time (check her character out by the pool...she's practically busting out of that bikini top).  Perhaps she was trying to move away from shedding her clothes and into a serious film career, one that never really materialized...big surprise there.  The characters in this film were actually distinctive, almost interesting...I'm not saying I developed fondness for any of them or cared whether or not they got nasty holes bore into them, but they exhibited a bit more individuality than I would have expected.  One of my biggest hang ups with this film was with the killer himself, who came off as a cross between Robbie Benson and Andrew `Dice' Clay, with, sadly, Robbie Benson being the more dominant personality.  He had the ability to pop in and out whenever and wherever he wanted and change certain aspects of reality, characteristics apparently borrowed from the Freddie Krueger character of Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street films.  At least there we had a memorable villain...here, the guy is just a greasy dink, one who performs the absolute worst dance number near the end of the film...no foolin'...another aspect that really ticked me off was the ambiguity in terms of the ending.  I won't reveal the `surprise', but it's nothing new, and I absolutely abhor when filmmakers take the route they did here, as it's often a pathetic attempt to cover up poorly written material, shoddy directing and laziness in general (note the ridiculously obvious product placement for Pepsi, Oxy-10, and Perrier, among others), which is pretty sad considering no one's expectations for a film like this would have been very high to begin with, but then that's just my opinion.

The fullscreen picture quality on this DVD is decent, but I did notice some dust on the print.  The DVD case claims some sort of re-mastering took place, but I think when they say `re-mastered', I think it means `transferred to DVD' and that's about it...the audio is about as good as the picture, meaning it's good enough to get by.  There are some biographies, and a theatrical trailer, but I'm unsure if this film ever made it to the theaters, or if it was a direct to video production.  Also included are trailers for some other films including Slumber Party Massacre (1982), Slumber Party Massacre III (1990), and Sorority House Massacre II (1990).  By the way, when I was talking earlier about lazy and sloppy filmmaking, it extends to the whoever released this DVD as two of the three pictures on the back of the DVD case are either from other films, or possible from scenes no longer included in this 75 minute version (word is there may be a 90 minute version out there, but I sincerely doubt lengthening the film by 15 minutes would have increased my enjoyment).

Her and her rockband friends go away for the weekend to a new condo of one of the girls parents.

  There is not a lot of action for most of the film, and later you see the killer, who has come to life from Courtney's dreams, singing and dancing Rock n' Roll and smoking cigarrettes as he kills with his guitar/drill.
