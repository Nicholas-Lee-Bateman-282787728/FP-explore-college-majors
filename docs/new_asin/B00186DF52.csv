8268440,3,B00186DF52,"A discombobulated Chad Johnson hosts dvd of random highlights.  Some of it's entertaining.  Some of it's edited horribly.  Tiny snippets are pasted together so fast it feels like A.D.D.  If they're gonna show the play, show the freakin' play.  Generally, the players they chose to focus on are good.  Over all, this could have been a lot better if they'd showed more highlights in their entirety and cut down on the ocho cinco jibberish.  Let Randy Moss host the next one and show all his good stuff back to college.  I'd pay twice as much for that.",1216944000,9,549,4.587628865979381
