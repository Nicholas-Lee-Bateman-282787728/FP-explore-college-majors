8150083,2,B000JE06JW,"These films are neither classic nor Brazilian in any sense: they are US government propaganda about Brazil, very shallow and favorable, stimulated by Brazil's entry on the Allied side in World War II. They are legitimate attempts to make Brazil better known and more like us than Americans may have believed at the time, but have almost no useful historical information. Much of the history is quite one-sided and glosses over massive Brazilian domestic problems, and are disappointing for potential users who may have hoped to get usable teaching materials about Brazil, rather than a period piece about what the WWII US government wanted Americans to believe about our cooperative neighbor.",1403568000,,692,5.243243243243243
