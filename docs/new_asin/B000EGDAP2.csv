8109114,5,B000EGDAP2,Classic Joe Cartoons that were once only available on the internet. Lots of fun and lots of laughs. Dark humor supreme.,1398384000,,119,4.714285714285714
8109115,5,B000EGDAP2,I loved going to his website and now I can take it with me so I can share it with my friends.,1391212800,,93,3.272727272727273
8109116,5,B000EGDAP2,"Joe has a very sick sense of humour and those with the same will enjoy this DVD almost as much as his website.  I've watched his site and cartoons grow over the years and am rarely disppointed.

Much more on his website.  Gotta check it out !!!!",1220313600,,245,4.170212765957447
8109117,3,B000EGDAP2,"I think anyone who has been on the internet for a few years has seen something over that time from Joe Cartoon, whether it be Frog In A Blender or Gerbil In A Microwave to maybe Joe Momma it would be a surprise to me if you have never come across something by Joe-Cartoon.

It was just recently a friend of mine sent me the link to one I hadn't seen before and I hadn't laughed so hard at something in ages. And while looking up some more from JC at the end of a clip it mentioned DVD's.

So I ordered vol 1 and 2 and expected them to have me rolling around on the floor gasping for breath. However, that was not the case at all.

I'd seen mostly everything on these DVD's before, and they never make you laugh as hard the 3rd time around. I like the fact that I have them on DVD and can watch them in good quality whenever I want without the need of a computer, but I feel kind of ripped off from the price of these two videos and the lack of entertainment provided on them.

Skipping past the cartoons, the other features are a series of Greenies or something that I didn't find many of them funny, and the bogus features are just that, REALLY bogus. There is some stupid clips of Joe in a destruction derby and these other clips that would be hounded with 1 votes if they where shown on YouTube. Then there is a heap of these YO-YO-YO things that where just annoying, they should have had a play all and not had to hear the beginning and ends of each one. only about 3 where worth watching but easily forgettable.

then there is vintage Joe, which wasn't worth looking at either.

There just doesn't seem to be enough on either volumes, even if both volumes where packed onto one disc, which could be easily done, it still would be disappointing. Honestly, you can watch it on his website for free, the DVD has nothing worth looking at that isn't on his site.

Unless you are a die hard fan and and just want to help Joe make some money, then buy his DVD. Other wise, just know what you've seen already is all thats worth watching.",1176163200,,2034,4.173469387755102
8109118,5,B000EGDAP2,"This DVD is a greatest hits collection of his best online flash animation and shows. The PRESS & SPLODE feature on the DVD gives the feel of authenticity if you're at all familiar with Joe and his flash animation. It really does hold true to the online versions of these features (Gerbil in a microwave, Joefish and Lump the no-legged dog, to name a few but there are 8 of these included). You get some of his famous shows like ""Stoneflies, Joe Momma and the hilarious GERBIL GENOCIDE"" which I feel was his crowning achievement. All of the content, 40 total episodes, are completely faithful to the original online versions including the load screens and all. Though, some are a bit more explicit than I remember (I think). If you are a fan of the web site, you really must own this and the Press & Splode feature works with your remote like it would using your mouse to work the flash animation on your computer. All I can say is I can't wait for volume 2 to come out. Joe Cartoon rules ! ""Yeah, who's with me!""",1154131200,3,1012,4.388297872340425
8109119,1,B000EGDAP2,"I was so looking forward to this DVD. Major let down !!!! While it IS funny there is far to much interaction. When I pop in a DVD I want to relax, enjoy and be entertained--instead I was constantly pushing buttons, little time to relax and enjoy-it didn't flow til I pushed a button...NOT my idea of entertainment! Again, don't waste your money..if the DVD was only $4.99 I would say buy it but at $19.95..NO !!! If another one is released I hope there is no button pushing or I won't buy it. Major let down.",1147046400,2,508,4.247422680412371
8109120,5,B000EGDAP2,"I really look forward to this. And this is by no means a review of the DVD, just the original content. It was so ahead of it's time for using Flash animation with user interaction. It even got me and others to dabble in in Flash. Standouts were the frog in the blender, and of course the hamster-gerbil thing in the microwave or getting shot, ect. The voices were one of the reasons it so funny, too! Good times, good times.",1144713600,7,424,4.246913580246914
