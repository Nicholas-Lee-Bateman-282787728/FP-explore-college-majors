8626576,5,B00GS16OYG,"Love this workout tape! The 500 calorie burn kicks my butt and is great if you want a longer, intense workout. It is hard to follow a few things at first but it only took me a few times to get used to it. The sculpting video is good if you want to do strength training only, and the last cardio video with all of the instructors is both fun and hilarious! I typically do the last two together but sometimes the strength training one I will do before a walk/jog.",1471392000,2,461,4.076923076923077

8626579,3,B00GS16OYG,"I am a 53 yr old woman, I definately have to modify.  It is a highly motivated video, it is unlike the other ""Firm"" video.  The leader does not go over the steps slowly before she jumps right into getting your heart rate up.  This is very discouraging.  Better yet if there was an available chaper in the beginning we could watch before we began the workout to learn the steps.  Just a thought.",1422057600,6,394,4.27027027027027

8626581,3,B00GS16OYG,The seller did fine but if you were into old school firms this DVD of FIRM workouts will not meet your expectations.,1408665600,3,116,4.318181818181818
