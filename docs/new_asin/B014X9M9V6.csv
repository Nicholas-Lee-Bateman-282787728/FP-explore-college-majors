8732161,4,B014X9M9V6,"The DVD is a burned using old-fashioned type media (not M-Disc). Great Movie. In COLOR.

Excellent movie. Well-written and well acted. NOT infected with the Cinavia DVD virus.

Don't buy this Russian movie if you think you might ever run for president. 'They' will use it against you.

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid $2 more for M-Disc, a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  The video and audio quality is excellent on the disc.

Sadly, the bottom one third of the subtitles are cut off. Making them difficult to read. Considering that most of this movie/documentary is narrated it's a shame it wasn't dubbed.  The subtitle problem is not due to my television or Blu-ray player. I've tried various settings, the bottom third is gone from the video permanently.

This review is for the product I received from Amazon. If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"".  There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery mechanism.

I highly recommend this great movie.",1525392000,,1253,4.890995260663507

8732163,2,B014X9M9V6,"This short film was all I exspected, and I personaly enjoyed it greatly.  As a russian film made in 1947 it contained an appriate amount of propaganda, but I was surprised that it included Robert Goddards contribution to rocketry. Think of our early space rocketry movies with silvery, pointed, large finned rockets being slowly pulled up by strings while flares burn at their bottoms and you'l recognize where that came from, probably here first. The entire first third of the movie covers Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's contribution to the mechanics of space flight and surprisingly still revelent and informative. appreantly orbital mechanics haven't changed much in the last hundred years or so. There are several scenes which should remind most of scenes from ""2001 a space odyssey"" the circular space station isn't as large but is still very impressive for the times. This fillm is probably one of the best informative and special effects pre-Disney Von Braun films out there.",1464998400,5,976,5.177215189873418
