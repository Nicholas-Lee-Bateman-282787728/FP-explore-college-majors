1443749,1,B00005JKJG,"Please - I implore you - DO NOT waste your money on this god-awful film!  Todd Solondz has gone WAY off course with this one.  Spend your money on ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" or ""Happiness"" and pretend this abomination never happened.",1027468800,4,233,4.658536585365853
1443750,1,B00005JKJG,"I am one of those people who loves almost every movie I see.  But, there are always exceptions.  I think Storytelling is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Maybe I just didn't understand it or something, but it did nothing for me.  Wait, that's wrong.  It, at times, offended me, bored me, confused me, and [made me mad].  Very rarely did I feel entertained.
There are two different stories, one titled ""fiction"" and the other ""non-fiction.""  In many movies with seemingly unrelated plot lines, they manage to weave together by the end.  In this movie, they stay completely unrelated.  There is no character overlap and no apparent reason that the two are both in the same movie.
The only thing I liked about this movie was the appearance of Conan O'Brian.  He was hilarious, and that was the one scene where I laughed out loud.  But, really, it was the only good thing I can remember.",1027036800,,891,4.575949367088608
1443751,5,B00005JKJG,"Todd Solondz's funny and controversial films examine sordid suburbia.  They are witty, satirical stories but also unflinching in their use of controversial subjects like rape, pedophilia and other ""uncomfortable"" subjects that most mainstream films would never have the nerve to address, much less use in a comedic context.  So, you either love his films or hate them (as the other reviews here will attest.)  I happen to love his films.
It might be best to watch his previous film, ""Happiness"", before watching ""Storytelling"" as ""Storytelling"" seems (to me) to be the film maker's personal response to the criticisms that his other films have elicited.  ""Storytelling"" is composed of two, separate stories titled ""Fiction"" and ""Non Fiction"".  ""Non Fiction"" features a documentary film maker (clearly representing Solondz)who's a downtrodden geek, accused of exploiting his subjects.
His films make you laugh but also uncomfortable about laughing.  I think he's an exciting voice in American cinema, far removed from the formulated drek that's cranked out by the studios.  Highly recommended!",1024099200,28,1092,5.502994011976048

1443845,4,B00005JKJG,"Storytelling is a strange one.  It's divided into two stories- the very sexually graphic and nudity-driven first one that involves a young woman played by Selma Blair in a debate group.  At first she likes to sleep around with her one male friend who has cerebral palsy, but she gradually loses interest in him which results in a few fighting scenes between the two (and the boy here plays having cerebral palsy VERY well).  Well apparently she's a skank because she soon finds herself attending a bar where her teacher in the debate class is sitting down having a drink, and they eventually end up having graphic sex after heading back to his life after Selma uses his bathroom and discovers a bag of pictures revealing this guy has a thing for making other students in the class pose in creepy nude ways.  I mean what the heck seriously?  This whole story.  Anyway the debate the students have is really honest which makes emotions soar sometimes.  This story end too soon however.

Then the second much longer story comes along.  For some reason this one is called ""Non-Fiction"" whereas I presume the first one is called ""Fiction"".  I think it would've worked WAY better to not tell us which was which and let us guessed instead.  Obviously they're both fiction unless mentioned elsewhere that they're based on true stories (and maybe that's the point- maybe the second one really *is* non-fiction whereas the first one is fiction, I don't have the details so I can only speculate).

Anyway the second story is very different.  It's about a high school kid (Leo Fitzpatrick) with no ambitions.  He's about ready to graduate high school, and his father (John Goodman) and others constant hammer him about his lack of ambition.  He spends all his time dragging his feet, listening to Elton John in his bedroom, and never accomplishing much.  A good portion of this story focuses on the family sitting around the dinner table wondering how to handle their sons bum style life.  Interesting part when the mother mentions during a discussion with her kids World War II and how they all very well could've been Europeans had they never came over.  Eventually it's decided by John Goodman that Leo must take the tests required to get into college.  Let's just say, Leo has a very dark twisted side that isn't realized until the end.  I won't spoil what I mean by this, but the ending caught me by surprise.

This story's far from done however.  Paul Giamatti's character is that of a documentary filmmaker, and he wants to document this family's life.  The problem is that he words things clumsily and often confuses the family so hilariously John Goodman has to correct him, which is a strange but fascinating way to make his character develop.  Also the youngest son, Jonathan Osser (who's not a very good actor since he's very specific and demanding in his lines reminding me of Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense) often communicates with the Spanish housekeeper lady, and asks question related to her belief in God and later when he discovers her crying, discusses why she's upset.  This is all very strange.

Overall, the first story feels incomplete and ends too soon whereas the second one just develops unusually, but they're both interesting enough to recommend Storytelling and give it a fairly high rating.  Perhaps the point here is to stress that young people don't really have a clue about anything and need guidance, I don't know.  And they need *real* guidance since obviously they're taking the wrong path in life.  I'm sure others will find deeper meaning to all this.",1438905600,,3584,4.7821138211382115

1443913,2,B00005JKJG,"The first thing you should know about this film is that most reviewers out there seem to have completely misinterpreted it. There some who call it a cruel parody of economic-class divisions; others say Solondz -- like Paul Giamatti's documentarian in the film -- is simply interested in exploiting his characters' cemented status as losers for his own benefit. Such interpretations are myopic and completely wrong.

Roger Ebert got it right (look up his review -- it's worth a read) when he said that it's an exploration of the motivations artists have for creating stories. And, as Ebert said, there's a confessional element to it, yes, but I'd say it goes even further and looks at why *anyone* frames the stories they tell, and even how we all interpret our respective places in the world. If we need to lie to others or to ourselves in order to gain some advantage or even just find some motivation to keep going, doing so is no problem for most of us. Truth becomes fictionalized, and falsehood gets passed off and accepted as truth.

I loved this concept and Solondz's general approach to it, so as a huge fan of _Welcome to the Dollhouse_, I really wanted to love this film. I was incredibly disappointed, then, in the execution. One major problem is that several of the actors (Leo Fitzpatrick, Mark Webber, Noah Fleiss, Andrew Marantz) just don't cut it; as a result, a number of scenes that should have been really emotionally poignant, simply fall flat or distract with their poor quality.

The directing, editing and some of the cinematography also go far in undercutting _Storytelling's_ potential. Even when the actors nail it (Selma Blair, Paul Giamatti, John Goodman, Julie Hagerty, Jonathan Osser, Lupe Onteviros), the air is let out by an awkward cut, a lifeless camera angle, a boring directorial choice. Solondz's fairly conventional presentation of his material worked perfectly in _Welcome to the Dollhouse_, because there, it created a frankness that caused that film's sometimes ultra-squirmy content to hit the viewer even harder. But in _Storytelling_, the style (approaching a total lack of style) just makes it look like he doesn't know what he's doing.

In the end, I can recommend this one as an imaginative examination of an important element of human psychology -- but it falls far short of being as good as Solondz's other work.",1398729600,,2361,4.924623115577889

1443953,1,B00005JKJG,"I did not read any reviews of this film before I watched, pardon me, started to watch this film. And it seems I didn't read any reviews before I bought it, either. Had I done so I would have thought twice about buying it.

So I settle down happily, all expectant, for I am a student in a screenwriting class myself and we know how hard it is to write something that will actually be put to screen, something that enthralls, that moves, that stirs people, something new and remarkable.

Well, first rule is, always show action for a reason. Make it lead somewhere, every single shot. Add dialogue for emphasis, to enhance the story. To help you out when you can't show something or don't want to. Rule two: make every character credible. Give them a function. Make them come alive, memorable.

First thing I notice when I watch the opening scene, how badly it is acted, but this is only the start and I am forgiving. Then I hear the dialogue and I think this better be good soon and start to play with my cat. When it doesn't I get curious and check out Leo Fitzpatrick. Can't find anything wrong with him, healthy boy he his (and good in the film Kids) and I think why do you use a real African American but can't use a real person with cerebral palsy. Mhhhh. Just to make a point in a seemingly shocking film.

Anyway, then it quickly deteriorates to the point that I stop and check how many people think the same and check it out on amazon sites in various countries. It emerges that the European sites have nothing but praise for the film and I am incredulous. The American one has got a good number of warnings. Let me add mine.",1312070400,,1632,4.323529411764706

1443955,3,B00005JKJG,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a big fan of ""movies within movies"", Adaptation being the most recent popular example. They always seem very arch and self-consciously clever, and forget to actually involve you in the characters you're watching.

As described below, 'Storytelling' consists of two shorts, one labeled 'fiction', the other 'non-fiction'. Ironies abound here. It's often said of literature that all fiction is unintentionally truthful, while non-fiction is filled with lies. James Frey is an embarrassing example of that phenomenon. Similarly, the 'non-fiction' short has a much more fantastical plot line than 'fiction' does. The 'fiction' short revolves around a college-level creative writing course, while 'non-fiction' shows a schlub (clear stand-in for Solondz) making a documentary about... something, if he can just figure out what that is.

This movie appears to be a direct response to criticisms of Solondz's earlier works. The song played as the credits roll asks pointedly what the audience expects of the story teller, what responsibility he has to them, and to his characters. 'Fiction' seems to address the first part of that question. One character asks the main character, 'Vi' why she must write about such ugly characters. Vi plaintively responds that she's writing about things that have really happened to her. For the millions who ask Solondz, or any other artist, why their creations are so insistently nasty, this appears to be the answer: because this is how Solondz experiences the world. I'm grateful that I only have to visit his world for an hour or two every few years. I wouldn't be able to bear much more. Of course, while we sympathize with Vi as she insists on the truth of her experience, at the same time, wink wink, we know she's a fictional character. How gratingly clever.

'Non-fiction' addresses the relationship between an author (or documentarian) and his subject. Paul Giamatti plays a schlub who is even more helpless than usual. He can't settle on a topic to shape all the footage he's taken of a particularly insipid teenager. He ultimately decides to go for some cheap laughs at the family's expense, rather than focus on the terrible tragedies that occurred during filming. So we, the audience, see a fictional audience jeering at this hapless teenager, and are reminded that we were laughing at him too just an hour ago. Wink, wink, see how clever and intertwined it all is?

Ultimately, I can't give this movie high marks because I was not invested in any of the characters. I appreciate Solondz and his willingness to break taboos, but there needs to be more there for a really great movie. For the record, 'Welcome To the Dollhouse' is one of my all-time favorites. Solondz's nihilism and despair seemed appropriate to that film, because teenagers lack adult perspective. It seems more jarring to me in a film like 'Storytelling' or 'Happiness'. Another reviewer expressed doubts that Solondz knows the first thing about sexual tensions between white women and black men, and I'm inclined to agree. I felt the same way about 'Happiness' - as I watched it, I asked myself, does Solodnz really know anything this topic, or is he simply trying to make our heads explode by portraying a sympathetic pedophile? I could be wrong, but it felt like the second to me. My (limited) understanding of pedophile psychology is that a pedophile would not recognize that it's wrong to molest children, or to draw a distinction between his son and other boys. Again, maybe I'm wrong - but I found 'Happiness' unconvincing.

To sum up: interesting, reliably shocking, pretty much what you'd expect from this director. I found it interesting, even illuminating, but not at all moving.",1262563200,,3737,5.030694668820678
1443956,1,B00005JKJG,"I don't have a ton of fancy over-analytical bull for you. This movie sucked. Both seperate mini-movies were hard to watch, painful even. I know other reviewers saw much more into it, but I just couldn't feel it. I love many of the actors that played in it, but just couldn't appreciate whatever sardonic angle the director was aiming towards.",1241136000,,342,4.716666666666667
1443957,4,B00005JKJG,"by Dane Youssef

This is yet another ""daring and provocative"" little ""taboo-breaking film"" from writer/director Todd Solondz (""Welcome To The Dollhouse,"" ""Happiness,"" ""Fear, Anxiety & Depression,"" Schatt's Last Shot""), so anyone who picks t his one up should know what to expect. In fact, dollars to diamonds, you wouldn't even think about picking this one up unless you were a fan.

Like fellow contraversal filmmaker Neil LaBute, he likes to shed a great deal of light on the uglier, loathsome, unsavory side of humanity. Is he trying to illuminate us all by showing us the dark matter of our society? How our cold and evil nature may be our downfall? And all the damage it's doing? Or is Solondz more infactuated by these all-too realistic monsters and villains he puts up there on the screen?

Is this weird little man enamored by his loathsome creations? Is he celebrating this callous side of the human race or satirizing it? Normally, he leaves that to us, but althroughout ""Storytelling,"" he seems to be trying to set the record straight.

For those who saw his heavily acclaimed (by critics and audiences alike) ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"" a movie about the hell almighty on earth that is junior high school.

I was not one of the film's many admirers.

Yes, I felt like just about everybody else that the film did have some poginant truths, but... I pretty much already knew them all. It all felt kinda redundant. I was in high school at the time and every scene I was watching, I thought, ""Yeah, no s-- t"" and ""God, these people are a------s and idiots.""

I mean, I know it's supposed to be a satire, but I felt too much like I was watching what I already knew and thought and what has been said too many times before. Solondz was preaching to the wrong choir there.

His next fim, ""Happiness"" about three sisters and their lives... and how adulthood is more or less as mentally unbalanced as junior high school. About three sisters and how their lives aren't as well-adjusted as they seem. The seemingly ideal perfect sister is dry, secretly dull and lives such a sterile life that when an obscene phone caller calls her... she starts stalking him.

The best line in the movie ""Happiness""... that almost encapsulates the entire film:

Helen Jordan: ""I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you.""

Joy Jordan: ""But I'm not laughing.""

The film is about two different forms of storytelling: Two seperate chapters, ""Fiction"" and ""Non-Fiction.""

""Fiction"" is a surprisingly short one. It's about the creative writing process, and it takes place in a creative writing class. Many of the main characters are all writing short stories, most of which are autobiographical.

A woman who has writing aspirations and her cerebal-palsy girlfriend with the same. Her name is Vi, and she breaks up with her boyfriend after his obviously autobiographical story is panned horribly by the school teacher who dismisses it first very crudely and then gets more elaborate.

He especially takes some kind of pleasure in attacking the title: ""The Rawness of Truth.""

It's the kind of story that leaves you thinking, ""Wow, is that in dire need of a rewrite.""

Pretty much the whole class warms up to it... except for the star pupil/teacher's pet... and the teacher himself, a Pulitzer-Prize winning author of a novel entitled, ""A Sunday Lynching.""

Marcus (Vi's boyfriend) is furious with her for not giving it to him straight. Marcus' ""Rawness"" is about how Vi gave him confidence and made him feel, as he puts it in his story... ""completely cerebal.""

Vi, stricken, gets hammered, lights up and...

The professor has a poetic line about the writing process that rings incredibly true: ""Whenever you write... it all becomes fiction.""

After the first story (""Fiction"") in the film ends, you can't get but the feeling that although something horrible and tragic has happened, perhaps it was nessicary. And after they take it all in, let in all sink in, lick their wounds, let some time pass... maybe they'll be ready to take the next step.

""Non-Fiction"" is about most likely Solondz experience as director and the whole documentary experience. Often at times, those documentarians seem to be roasting and attacking their subjects with great anger and fury... but are they just trying to get heat for their film... or is that how they really see it?

Who knows? Many artists are former victims, grown children with bad experiences and hell-bent on vengeance. ""Non-Fiction"" revolves around the exploits of a documentarian filmmaker and his desire to make a documentary about teenagers and what they're feeling now.

Have things changed much? Drugs... suicidal feelings... self-loathing... loathing of the world around them... of the way society treats them, pressures them, conforms them and disposes of them... how do teenagers put up with it? What's ahead? Mark Webber is Scooby Livingston, a depressed and moody teenager who's completely lost and like many teenagers, his all-purpose requests to every queston is ""I don't know,"" ""I really don't care"" and ""Whatever.""

He always seems deep in thought and in need of answers. He has big goal aspirations... but no idea whatsoever as how to attain them. When asked how he plans to attain his dreams of stardom, he answers: ""I don't know, see if I have any connections... whatever..."" After a meet-strange with a documentarian named Toby, both seem to think the other may be exactly what they're looking for and maybe their seemingly unobtainable dreams might have a chance of coming true after all.

The family is not enthusiastic about the whole thing... especially the father who doesn't want the family's dirty laundry to be aired out. But after some hard questions and earnest promises, he agrees.

No family wants to be exploited... and this family certainly would provide more than enough of such material. I think the boy represents Solondz as a young teenager (Solondz himself is also a vegetarian) and of course, Giamatti as Toby is Solondz as a filmmaker (Solondz dresses up Giamatti to look exactly like him).

There's pressure all around from every angle and sadly, no way out in sight. College doesn't sound appealing and there has to be a place for Scooby. Since Scooby grew up to be Solondz himself (we can only assume), there must be hope.

But I think Scooby represents all teenagers. He reflects not our generation, but that paticular case, that type. That unfortunate type.

God, how many teens are there out there EXACTLY like Scooby? Actually, I think he represents the teens who are more depressed, desolate and lost. The ones who are always feeling lost... swimming against the tides, always feeling trapped with a feeling of hopelessness.

If you've ever seen a Solondz movie, you really do know what to expect.

Like all of his other efforts, this is about how ugliness and unsettling rage lives in middle class suburbia. You can't watch this movie, see and hear some of these people and not think of someone you know or have met or seen randomly on the street.

Solondz is from Suburbia, New Jersey and is talking about what's going on there.

I like how he talks about things that most movies and people in real life shy away from. He wants to critisize, satirize and get you to ask yourself...

""How many people are really like this? And... is there hope for us? How many of these people exist... and more importantly, are they in our neghiborhood? Not many... hopefully.""

Like all of Solondz films, people will either be mesmerized by it or despise it, but it's a movie that many should see.

Perhaps a movie for cynical teenagers and aspiring storytellers. Just know what you're getting into.

One can sense that Solondz is merely attacking his critics, and is using satire to do so. He pulls no punches, and as usual, remains as cynical as ever. The performances are great all around. The film is split into two parts, ""Fiction"" and ""Non-fiction"", which seem unrelated at first. It's not until after the film ends, that you can pick up on the subtle connections between the two. Once again, not a film that I would recommend to just anyone, but if you are familiar with Solondz at all, it's worth a shot...however, there are two scenes here that are rough and a bit gratuitous in nature.

  ""There isn't a laugh in it. . .""
  ""Arrogantly refuses to tell a cohesive story. . .""
  ""Simply mean-spirited. . .""
  ""More the illusion of substance. . .than substance. . .""
  ""It. . .offended me, bored me, confused me. . .very rarely did I feel entertained.""

1443961,5,B00005JKJG,"Storytelling is another highly enjoyable, if typically disturbing work from the New York director Todd Solondz.  His films, from his first breakthrough `Welcome to the Dollhouse' to the recent `Palindromes', have all been thoughtful and controversial dark comedies.  In my view, the comedic moments have become a little scarcer and less funny in his last two films (this one and Pallindromes), but the philosophical ruminations have been taken to another level.  Here, as in Pallindromes, the director explores in a highly original way, the seemingly inescapable but ultimately cruel and futile need of individuals to impose artificial narrative structure on the lives of themselves and others.  As the abusive black tutor in the first of the film's two `stories' puts it : `Our stories run better when they have a beginning, a middle and an end, but as soon as we try to frame them in words and meanings we must admit that they become fiction'.

Solondz's world is a dark one, a world in which all human relationships are abusive Sartrean power struggles, where even our very identities are attempts to fix `the other' into a false straitjacket in order to increase our own power to define and control the world.  These battles are fought often enough through primitive means of physical or sexual abuse, but they are always ultimately decided by the more sophisticated armouries of words, labels and meanings.  His films provoke and unsettle above all because he refuses to fix himself to any one moral interpretation or `camp', right or left, and even dares to challenge the left's sanctity of the victim/abuser relationship.  Solondz has been criticised for raising the unspeakably ugly head of paedophilia above the dinner party discussion table yet here he explores the female `converse' of negrophilia in a similarly stark and honest manner.  The black male tutor at the creative writing school has a penchant for sexually degrading his young white female students.  We are shown, however, that he is only in a position to exploit his perversion because those same women (like all the white females in the school) sexually objectify and fetishise a racist and harmful stereotype of the Afro-american male as a violent brute with a huge penis.  That the holding back of the black American male in contemporary society is no longer the result of the evil racism of the white American male, but in fact lies now more in the grotesque sexual appetites and fetishes of American women is a typically bitter pill for the left leaning cinema goer to be asked to swallow.  But for this hugely talented film director, nothing should be black and white and any attempt to pretend otherwise is mere storytelling.",1188432000,4,2707,5.00445434298441
1443962,5,B00005JKJG,"Todd Solondz is a talented filmmaker and I can say that after seeing only one of his films. I saw ""Happiness"" a few months ago and appreciated it for how smart it was. It was disturbing, disgusting, but smartly written despite all the vulgarity (something I normally never have a problem with). When discussing ""This Film is Not Yet Rated"" he mentioned a scene from that film was from ""Storytelling"" a movie I had never heard of. I rented it that day and saw that it was written and directed by Todd Solondz, so I expected the same kind of thing. When the film ended I just thought...Wow. This is a great film. Unique, provocative, funny, and very intelligently written. I loved it. It's separated into two parts, two mini-movies if you will. The first is ""Fiction"" and the second is ""Non-Fiction."" At least, those are those titles, which are ironic in the same way the title of ""Happiness"" is. The movie runs 82 minutes. I expected them to be 40 minutes apiece. Oddly enough, ""Fiction"" is 27 and ""Non-Fiction"" is 55. A lot of writers would fear doing something like this, but Solondz doesn't want to fill something in just because it's expected. Both films end exactly when they should and not a single scene seems unnecessary. Here's a synopsis of both:

FICTION:

A college student named Vi (Selma Blair, looking beautiful) has been ""dating"" Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick, ""Kids""), a man with cerebral palsy. After he writes a short story based on their relationship and is told by the professor, Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom) that his story sucks. Since Vi told him it was good, he's disappointed and breaks up with her. Vi goes to a bar to ""get drunk and get laid"" and finds Mr. Scott there. This leads to two things...A terrific ending and a (dare I say it) great ""erotic"" scene.

NON-FICTION:

In this story, a loser documentary filmmaker named Toby (Paul Giamatti) sets out to make a documentary about teenagers. He finds the perfect specimen (at least, the only one who will participate in it) in Scooby (Mark Webber), a gay Conan O'Brien wannabe. Scooby lives with an overbearing father (John Goodman, in top form), a strange and possibly mentally challenged mother (Julie Haggerty), a popular brother Brady, and a little demon-child intelligent younger brother named Mikey. Several sub-plots abound in this story, including Brady having a football accident and Mikey's attempts to get their nanny Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros) fired. The ending is one of the best endings I've seen in a long time.

Out of both stories, I like ""Non-Fiction"" the best. Both are terrific, containing great acting and well-written story lines that never faulter. But ""Non-Fiction"" is just a masterpiece all its own.

Giamatti, Goodman, Webber, and Ontiveros are superb. The dialogue is so funny and so meaningful. I can't rave enough about this movie. Both endings make so much sense; they're almost poetic. This film is a masterpiece, a movie that truly deserves to be seen by a larger audience. Even if you didn't like ""Happiness"" or any of Solondz's other work (I now want to see more of it) I urge you to see this film. This is an American comedy that ranks right up there with

Sideways, Election, and About Schmidt.

1444003,2,B00005JKJG,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

It's probably fun to make a movie about yourself -- or one that focuses closely on you -- and that is what director Solondz has done with STORYTELLING. Not only is the film divided into two nearly unintelligible segments, it is further broken down during the final section by portraying a down-on-his luck director (Paul Giamatti, THE ILLUSIONIST) who is obviously a doppelganger of Solondz himself.

Overflowing with apathy, Storytelling has two distinct parts: ""fiction"" and ""nonfiction."" In fiction, which launches the film, we're introduced to Vi (Selma Blair, HELLBOY), a young New Jersey college student involved in a writing/literature class that concentrates on critique. Her boyfriend Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick, THE WIRE TV series) has cerebral palsy and it appears the only reason she's with him is because of her apathy toward college life and those that haunt its halls. The teacher of the class is a forbidding black man named Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom, also from THE WIRE), a Pulitzer Prize winner who's flat affect and bored demeanor heaves a heavy shadow over the class. But apathy attracts apathy in Solondz story, so Vi and Mr. Scott have a sexual encounter, if for no other reason than to slip out of their routines and into one another. There's actually some interesting dark sexual comedy here, but it quickly dissolves.

Perhaps ""fiction"" was part nonfiction, too, as one could easily see Solondz sitting in a class, reading stories that get sledgehammer critiques.

The second and final portion of Storytelling is ""nonfiction."" Here we find Toby Oxman (Giamatti), a man who can't seem to finish anything. But when he discovers a young kid named Scooby (Mark Webber, THE MEMORY THIEF) who mirrors Toby's own apathy toward life, the wannabe film maker believes he's found a new calling: to make a documentary about society. John Goodman (O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?) stars as Scooby's father, a big man that pushes his kids and family too hard to become his ideal nuclear family. His wife Fern (July Hagerty, AIRPLANE) is just as disinterested in life as the rest of the cast, but hides it behind a facade of smiles. The only empathetic character in the Webber household is the maid Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros, TORTILLA HEAVEN) who gets fired because she shows some interest in life. Toby Oxman films all of the Webber household people but keeps his focus on Scooby, whom he sees strictly as a character subject.

That the film ends abruptly with the death of Scooby's family, and we still see no emotional response from him, only adds to the viewer's anger that there's no one in the film to care about. No protagonist that we can get behind. No angst from any of the characters. They are blobs of human flesh pooling around each other in uninteresting ways.

Directing a movie about apathy has been done before; AMERICAN BEAUTY is probably the most notable of these. But the characters were multifaceted and you cared about them. Here in Storytelling, the premise seems to be filming a flick about apathy just for the sake of showing apathy.",1161648000,2,3083,4.942084942084942
1444004,1,B00005JKJG,"Why does Hollywood concentrate on people who use their freedom and advantages (more than any country has enjoyed in history)to feel sorry for themselves and destructive behavior

The second tale Non Fiction..is about a family who is physically healthy, have financial freedom and every advantage 90% of the people in the world would cherish..and have no desire to make contributions to a society that has given them so much..Thankfully most Americans are not like these losers, otherwise our republic would not have survived wars, depressions, and constant changes for 230 years.

This is supposed to be an accurate picture of Suburbia..I taught in suburbian America for 35 years..I met parents who cared and did all they could to understand and encourage their children and I had countless students who loved their parents, appreciated their schools and wanted to make the world better..

THESE are the families whose stories deserve to be told..but they run counter to Hollywood's cynical, atheistic view of humanity...

If you don't mind spending your time with self pitying, unappreciating, unambitous, dull people, this film is your cup of tea....(with every bitter herbs..)",1152921600,6,1179,5.32258064516129
1444005,5,B00005JKJG,"This is the first film I've seen that for me personally really captures the spirit of suburbia. This is my own experience yes, however, this film doesn't waste any time glorifying or lashing out, it's evenly paced and pointedly wise. The driving force behind the actual 'storytelling' theme is wildly intelligent as well-commenting on the need for suburban creatives to come to terms with, profit from and move away from their pasts without really coming to terms with themselves. The film definitely has some controversial elements to it that will disturb the average moviegoer, but ultimately displays an accurate peripheral vision of the spirit of upper-middle class suburbia.",1135987200,5,679,5.296296296296297
1444006,4,B00005JKJG,"In ""Storytelling"", Todd Solondz wields his darkly hysterical wit against the art of narrative.  In two stories - a shorter one (""Fiction"")starring Selma Blair as a ruthlessly abused college-writing student, and a longer one (""Non-Fiction"") featuring an extra-shlubby Paul Giamatti as a would-be documentarian.  Giamatti and Blair play writers lacking any control over their stories or even any basic idea of how to tell their stories.

In ""Fiction"", Blair is Vi, a middling aspiring writer in a college writing workshop populated partly by other middling aspiring writers, and partly by mercilessly efficient critics who pull apart the stories of others, and their authors as well.  Told that she's got little talent, Vi commits herself to turn her life into a story, then write about it.  It's an interesting story, but a short one - Vi is too insubstantial a character to withstand the Solondz-treatment, and once the point is made, there's little left of her to survive.  (Even if her story was true, her professor intones, once it's on paper, it's fiction; that's the cope de grace against her - following a raft of utterly destructive reviews by fellow students that must be heard to be believed.)

In ""Non-fiction"" Giamatti tries to document...well he's not sure.  A serial failure (acting, law school, writing), Giamatti decides to try documentary-movie making - but he's only got a vague idea of what he can and wants to do, and he's too weak-willed to keep his subjects from commandeering his movie.  Giamatti's focus is ""Scooby"" Livingston, a very familiar Solondz-type (middle child of a comfortably middle-class modern-Jewish family).  Scoob is utterly alienated - he's undirected, unambitious (he wants to be Conan O'brien's sidekick) sexually conflicted, and stuck between two brothers ever more in control than he is.  As in ""Fiction"", Giamatti is paired up with a narrative conscious - a producer better able to chart the direction of Giamatti's film than Giamatti can.  There are no stand-out performances, because Solondz integrates his characters like the complex components of a WMD - Giamatti & his producer, Vi & her professor(Robert Wisdom), Scooby's homophobic and domestic autocrat father (John Goodman) and his sons.

Both stories excel at dissecting the narrative process and revealing the flaws of the failed creators, and they're both quite funny - nobody can do bittersweet & funny at the same time like Solondz.  This may be the single cruelest film that you'll ever laugh your head off watching.",1132099200,4,2527,5.192118226600985
1444007,5,B00005JKJG,"This is probably my favorite example of dark comedy to date--but it's very all-or-nothing. There are only 2 funny parts, each one taking up half the movie. Most of the movie is stupid, offensive, dark...just all around disturbing. If you stay curious about where it's going to go and open minded, you'll have a better shot at being one of those who get the punch line(s) and find them funny. All the horrible stuff they put you through is just setup for a (sick) joke. I saw this with a couple of people who didn't get it, and frankly I can see where they're coming from. However, the dedication to the jokes is incredible, and if they work for you, the punch lines are just...ridiculous. If your sense of humor is dark or highly adaptable, this film is worth checking out--otherwise, don't bother, because you'll just come away thinking it's disturbing and pointless.",1128556800,2,868,4.6797385620915035
1444008,3,B00005JKJG,"I'm one of those that this movie didn't do much for. I wasn't a Todd Solondz fan to begin with, truth be told. I didn't care for Welcome to the Dollhouse when it came out, but that was some time ago and I didn't mind giving him a try again. For me, however, this movie has very little to recommend it. It's amusing at times, quirky and thought provoking at times, but I end up feeling Solondz is more the illusion of substance than he is substance. He makes things weird enough, puts issues in your face enough, and makes sure to appear to be taboo-breaking enough that you'll walk away talking, debating, creating meaning. But in and of itself the film and his character development offers little.

I don't buy for a moment that he actually knows anything about the sex and race issues of black men and white women, the focus of the first section. But he throws it in your face as if his main goal is to get a reaction, any reaction. It feels a bit like reality tv - ie, very UNREALITY entertainment wherein people are made to push each others' buttons for the viewers amusement.

This viewer, however, wasn't amused. I can see that late teen and early-twenties viewers might like this. Maybe that's his audience. But this is not a particularly adult film, and this filmaker has yet to offer much of importance. He might. But he hasn't yet.",1126828800,7,1341,4.4471544715447155
1444009,3,B00005JKJG,"I was excited to recieve my copy of Storytelling because i am a recent fan of Todd Solondz and wanted to get my hands on some of his more recent work.  Having just recently watched Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse i really expected more from this movie.  Reading other reviews i see people complaining about fiction but i thought it was the better of the two stories.  I mainly feel this way because nonfiction couldn't have moved any slower or been more boring.  Not even John Goodman and Paul Giamatti could save this story.  I don't mind slow stories if there is more going on than whats just on the screen but there wasn't with this tale and aside from the little corks thrown in that seemed out of place the story of a loser kid with no ambition being presured to go to college by his rich parents has been told many times better already so why bother telling it again if you don't have anything to add?  I cant imagine that nonfiction was actually based on any real events and if it was then he should have told it better because it creeped along at such a snails pace that i barely made it through it.  Fiction was the better story imo mainly because it moved at a better pace and the acting was much better.  Selma Blair and Leo Fitzpatrick were great were as the kids in nonfiction stumbled over almost all of thier lines.  I also found fiction to be more realistic than nonfiction which may have been the point of the two stories with contradicting titles.  At any rate, if your new to Todd Solondz's work check out dollhouse or happiness as they are much better films.  I have not seen Palindromes yet but hopefully its more on par with his earlier work.",1118793600,2,1671,4.375404530744337
1444010,5,B00005JKJG,"Is this film supposed to be realistic?  No, because reality would be far too drawn out and boring for any film maker to successfully render.  Instead, Solondz finds nuances and exploits them to their fullest, and the result is astounding.  Although ""Fiction"" is short, it has a lot to say about sexuality and self deprication, and the critique of teacher and students is priceless.  The ridiculousness of the characters in ""Nonfiction"" is enthralling.

""Storytelling"" is of course not for everyone, and I believe most people would be offended by it.  I highly recommend it to those who seek a subtle shock and who appreciate dark humor.  This has been my favorite movie since I first saw it.",1115078400,2,691,4.854700854700854
1444011,4,B00005JKJG,"This film wasn't made to show all of you how a ""real"" university fiction writing class is, or how ""real"" a Jewish  suburban family is. This film is less real than Sponge Bob Squarepants. It travels the same lines as Apocalypse Now, in that it encapsulates the graphic possiblities, and tragic surrealities of life and turns the amps up to ten. The situations in this film are extreme to further illustrate his undelying themes of non-hero's and how tragic hope can be. The characters fluctuate between being stupid, honest, demonic, blatent, obvious, and dangerous. He also creates points of focus in the film that are meant to lead our thoughts through his maze. We identify with the Cerebral Palsy kid, then Selma Blair, but then we see how their bad choices land them in scenarios that are grotesque. We suddenly stop identifying with them. Most of the characters are complex, except for obvious villians, like John Goodman, and the cold, callous, indiferent masochist 'teacher'. The boy in 'non fiction' is a good example of the multifaceted nature of Solondz's characters. We hate him, but why? He was raised in an indifferent family that doesnt prize humanity or kindness. He has his 'maid' fired because she wouldnt clean his juice up. He has no sense of humanity or compassion. Why wouldnt he? His family, whom he loves, has not shown compassion, or taught him about work or poverty. He is clueless. Watch this film closely. It is not a pop culture romp.

1444063,5,B00005JKJG,"...is what Solondz seems to excel in capturing in his movies, and if you have the stomach to sit through it, it's hard not to admire the man's sheer artistic ballsiness as well as his virtuosity.

Many of us come to a movie expecting to find clear distinctions between ""good"" and ""bad"" characters whom we are able to peg within the first five minutes, to be manipulated and cliched into identifying with the ""good"" characters so that we really care about the outcome of the predictable clash between them and the ""bad"" characters, as if the Happy Uplifting Life-Lessons-Learned ending was ever in doubt for even a nanosecond.  That is, after all, what Hollywood spoonfeeds us 90% of the time---not only the cheesey action blockbusters but also the alleged ""dramas"" and ""comedies"" too...it's all been focus-grouped to death before the final cut.  Make that focused-grouped to death before the contract to produce the film is even signed.

So it is no wonder that many people have a problem with a movie like this.  It's basically one short, about a creative writing class, its freaky and mediocre students, its freaky and sadistic teacher who may or may not be another mediocre writer.  As a veteran of many collegiate creative writing classes, I can attest that there are quite a few grains of truth here.

The longer second film is about a typically dysfunctional upper-middle class suburbian family headed by the venerable John Goodman, complete with exploited Latin American maid.  Again, just like the vision of suburbia in his earlier film ""Happiness,"" this one definitely rang more than its fair share of bells.

There really are no ""good"" characters---everyone is dysfunctional in their own ways, some more grotesquely than others.  That's one of the most beautifully refreshing things about Solondz's work: he never cops out and inserts some easy-to-root-for lollipop characters but instead challenges us to work hard to infer some redeeming qualities in all of them, and makes us acutely aware of the difficulty of that work.

Yes Solondz's is a brutally dark and merciless vision of life and people in general, but I'd argue that it is a largely accurate one...if we are willing to strip away our comforting habitual delusions/cliches and see the spades for the spades that they all are.  The only really obvious flight of fancy here is the Latin maid's revenge at the end, which I gather is more of a fantasy sequence than anything else, or perhaps prophetic and allegorical.

And Solondz never fails to infuse his films with plenty of jet-black humor, spontaneity and originality.  You never feel as if he's beating you over the head with The Message (calling Steven Spielberg and Spike Lee!), or taking the easy way out, or copping out and dumbing things down for easier consumption by a wider audience.

In light of the films that are usually made, ""Storytelling"" (along with his other film, ""Happiness"") is nothing short of miraculous.  Hats off to Solondz for refusing to take prisoners.",1105142400,4,3003,4.9640718562874255

Film quality was low, there wasn't any soundtrack that I could remember--except maybe the psychedellic sex scene.  The acting was fine, but what was the point of this movie? It seemed bent on squeezing in the most akward sex moments. The MOST akward and disturbing.  It opens with Slema Blair's rather unclothed upper torso flying--later we see her in what can only really be taken as a rape scene, which is nicely disorted in the fullbody shots by a large orange rectangle (doesn't get rid of the sound or the very on purpose un-p.c. language) and then the psychedellic sex scene--which is implied between two boys, which is also almost another rape.

This movie also features the most evil little boy I have had to witness in a long time, some perversion of the child outwitting the grownups cliche that hollywood is fond of using (aka Home Alone).

The first part is like a litany of intense pain, where you can only laugh or be repulsed. The film lets you off the hook in the second part.

The second part of this movie is altogether different, and i guess it did belong in the comedy genre, although it was still more of a Dra-medy. Paul Giamatti is great as the director guy and John Goodman is one of the only redeeming comedy figures in the movie. (just watching him yell is funny to me). But i wasn't really prepared to watch two wholey different movies and i was pretty burned out toward the end. Because it just seemed like i sat through two movies.

Final thoughts.....you probably know what you are geting into if you get this movie, but for people who barely remember his style, its alot more/different than a normal comedy, which i don't think it even is.

1444069,5,B00005JKJG,"The mode of portraying a tale is in focus in Storytelling through two different stories that are disconnected, yet associated to one another, as one deals with the fictional and the other the non-fictional.  In the first part, Fiction, Vi (Selma Blair) is in a relationship with Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick) who suffers from cerebral palsy and both are attending the same university.  Vi and Marcus are currently enrolled in the same creative writing class where the students scrutinize each other's writing.  Fiction exposes how personal experiences are turned into writing, which is callously slaughtered by judgmental readers as they their own set of values to the cerebral playing field of literature.
The second part of Storytelling, Non-fiction, illiterates the reality of the world as Scooby Livingston (Mark Webber) perceives it.  Scooby lives in a upper-class bubble protected by his ruling father, Marty (John Goodman), where Scooby is constantly asked, ""what are you going to do with your life?""  This endless questioning of Scooby's future seems to have been stressful for him as he has sunk into a zombie-like state.  Scooby escapes reality through smoking pot or chewing down a couple of mushrooms where he flees into dreams of working as a co-host with David Letterman.  The day when a shoe salesman, who aspires to make film, visits Scooby's high school in order to make a documentary about the process of entering college Scooby believes that this is his chance to make connections in the world of media.  However, when the documentary comes along it begins to depict the dream-like world in which Scooby lives in.
Storytelling is a clever film that displays the symbiosis between the audience and the storyteller, which is meticulously directed by Solondz.  Solondz depicts the power of the audience to choose what to believe and what to disregard if it is not portrayed in an manner that the audience can accept.  In addition, Solondz offers a notion of how the power of storytelling can sway an audience's convictions in a chosen direction if carefully planned.  In a sense Storytelling is a philosophical film in regards to film and film making, which can be derived from the economics, politics, and the arts.  Yet, the philosophical debate of Storytelling is deep beneath the surface as the audience must use a dialectic approach in order to reach it.  Nonetheless, Storytelling offers a terrific cinematic experience as it offers the audience to choose whether to sink into thought or merely enjoy the ride.",1089849600,12,2527,5.089588377723971

1444072,5,B00005JKJG,"""Storytelling"" is not one film, but two. They are both different, but very related. The first story is called ""Fiction"" and it stars Selma Blair, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Robert Wisdom. Selma Blair stars as Vi, a collage student who is taking a writing course with her boyfriend Marcus, who has celebral palsy. The class is taught by Pulitzer-Prize winning author Gary Scott. When Marcus's story is comments badly by Gary, he becomes nervous that Vi is interested in Gary when she does not stand up to him during the class. They break up, but when Vi goes to a bar she meets Gary, and she learns something about him, and her life is changed.
The second and longer story is called ""Nonfiction"" and it stars Paul Giamatti, who already amazed me this year with ""American Splendor"" and he gives another great preformance as Tobey Oxford, a documentary filmmaker who is doing a documentary about high school students, and how it is hard to get into the collage of your choice. He finds his focus in Scooby Livingston, who is a student who does not want to go to collage, and is a slacker who has no idea what he wants to do in the future. That makes his parents, Marty and Fern, ticked off at him, and also their middle child Brady to the suspection that he is gay. Their youngest son Mike, is ten years old, and is complety spoiled, and also interested in their live in maid Consuelo's life and family history. As Tobey shoots the documentary, the family deals with problems that arise, untill finally ""Nonfiction"" and the movie comes to a surprising and bitter end.
The end of ""Nonfiction"" surprised me. I did not see anything like that coming. It also made me think that I should have seen it coming. I was decieved. What I liked about the movie was how the two stories were related to each other. They were both about high school life, and the problems that teenagers face. They were also totally unrelated, because they both focus on the different types of storytelling. The documentary being the nonfiction. The short stories being the fiction. I thought that ""Storytelling"" was a very funny, and very brilliant film. It was short and sweet. I liked the scene where Mike spills some juice, finds the maid crying about how one of her family members has been excuted for rape and murder, and then kindly asks her to clean it up for it. It is a character study, because it shows how spoiled this family is, and how they have everything done for them. Throughout the film, except for Mike, they don't even notice that she is around.
""Storytelling"" deals with another major subject of racism, so it is not for everyone. In ""Fiction"" Gary Scott's character is black, and in Vi's final story, with a black character like him in it, everybody in the class has a comment to say about how it is a black man. I feel that this shows how just because something happens to somebody else, and a black man is the cause of it, it is racism. It's a sad, but true fact. ""Storytelling"" was a great movie, and it is not a film for everybody, but those with an open mind will enjoy it.
ENJOY!

1444133,4,B00005JKJG,"After the acclaimed and controversial ""Happiness"", Todd Solondz produced another acid and depressing vision of today`s America. Forget ""American Beauty"", since ""Storytelling"" goes further down the spiral. The movie contains two distinct segments, the first, ""Fiction"", and the second, ""Non-Fiction"". In the first, a writing student gets involved with her teacher and that experience will determine her vision of the world and her writing process, leading to a complex, tense discussion. In ""Non-Fiction"", Solondz makes an insight into the ""typical"" american family, presenting some dysfunctional characters who struggle to somehow survive in a bitter, convulted world. The director also reflects on the effects of the showbiz industry and its relevance in a society full of lonely and depressed individuals. Sarcasm and irony are a constant here, used to maximum effect to describe the growing process of a young slacker who tries to find something worth caring about but ends up failing again and again.
Although it`s not perfect, ""Storytelling"" is nonetheless a powerful movie that gives much food for thought and again shows the strenght of one of the most original voices of american indie cinema. Very good but not for everyone.",1075334400,,1233,5.427083333333333

Perhaps it's becuase I'm a Brit, we both are. But for a film that's supposed to be darkly humourous, there isn't a laugh in it. It labours most of it's points so hard you want to get up and club it to death, and most of them you can see coming a mile off. It's just dull, the characters are unsympathetic characatures, and the plot is risable.

1444135,2,B00005JKJG,"Storytelling is a bit of a disappointment except for some great moments that really stand out, but sadly overall is not really this director on form. There are some social statements made here but the film does bore at times and never really manages to engage the viewer. It sort of ends up looking like a somewhat rushed piece of work and you get the feeling that a little more attention to the script would have made all the difference.
Many of the big name actors here are obviously involved in this project because of the director's previous powerhouse drama ""Happiness"". Although we are not expecting the director to do all that again we are expecting a story, but really only get some piece of experimental cinema that seems as if it was just made for the director's amusement alone and very little else. Storytelling almost plays out as if the director is trying to establish a film that he wants to make. So he has filmed all of these scene to try and see what kind of film he would eventually like to make, but instead actually presents this test as the final approved version of the film. Could it be that this director is just testing the critics to see if they would end up loving a ""bad"" movie because of his last piece of work?
The ""film"" is two different stories. One is about a student writer who ends up doing a very non-politically correct story about domination by a mandingo black teacher. The other story is about a documentary film maker following a student at school and at home with his family. The scene at the table about Nazis and being conceived in the womb is fantastic but there is little else here except for maybe the burning at the stake scene.
Overall this is just a bad film that doesn't work. Only recommended as something you should see because you like the director - but all else should avoid.",1073692800,2,1832,4.4880239520958085

Where WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE and HAPPINESS are cynical comedies, STORYTELLING is simply a mean-spirited movie. What this movie really lacks is a coherent story to tie the depressing subject matter into a humorous movie. If you're new to Solondz's work, watch his previous movies first.",1073606400,,459,4.974025974025974
1444137,5,B00005JKJG,"I won't review it or give it away...I hate to do that. But you should really be prepared for some weird and shocking stuff to the max...specially the first 30 minutes of the film!!! those 30 minutes are a masterpiece...the rest of the film is not as good but still very interesting.  I trully enjoy exploitation flicks!!!
Todd Solondz is the new master of suburbian exploitation. I love all his stuff but this is definitely not for everyone. Even though he uses shock value to reflect untypical darkly funny situations...some mystical intelligence is present. I don't like reviews...movies should speak for themselves the same as portraits and paintings, but if you haven't seen any of Todd Solondz films, then you should try first with ""Happiness"" and then try ""Storytelling"" or ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"". This is a very difficult and quite icoherent film to watch if you haven't seen his first two entries...but still has some very imaginative elements. So if you like weird, hard to watch and untypical films...give this a try.",1072569600,,1031,4.959537572254336

The critics are right to say that this is Solondz's slightest effort so far, but it's still much stronger than just about any contemporary film I can think of.  Solondz deserves great esteem just for having the courage and vision to make films that don't flinch in their depiction of naked reality.  If that weren't enough, his films also manage to be wonderfully acted and strikingly photographed.  The hysterical reactions that his films evoke, are in my opinion, evidence of his considerable powers as an artist.  I recommend all three of his films to anyone who knows that films are more than just entertainment.  Look out for Steve Railsback(Helter Skelter, Lifeforce) as an apathetic highschool principal and Mike Shank(American Movie) as a stoner cameraman.",1069977600,,893,5.082191780821918
1444139,4,B00005JKJG,"I am still unsure that I have totally understood this movie; however, I am sure about enjoying its viewing quite a lot (especially the second part), and this in spite of the fact that I cannot say I felt a lot for, or identified with any of the characters.
I think in both parts the personalities are all somewhat grotesque; however, each of the characters has certain behaviors which are very human and very familiar - although not ""socially accepted"". An example for this would be Mickey, the youngest son in the second part, hypnotizing his father and asking that from now on he, Mickey, will be the favorite son.
The first part is called ""fiction"" but rather, tries to show the reality of what we choose to term fiction. We meet a few participants in a literary workshop were the student-writers build on their personal experience for their story-writing and then succumb to the criticism of their class mates and the class teacher whose harsh verdict affects all members of the group.
The literary class cannot accept one of the stories and claims it to be ""racist"" while our frustrated heroine (Vi) tries to convince the class that what she wrote about can happen in reality and did in fact happen (as the viewer well knows). Vi is fragile and sweet and we are totally on her side although not all her actions and behaviors are fully comprehensible.
There is something quite ruthless about this part. A very hard uncomfortable statement about human beings, their cruelty and motives that immediately brings to mind ""Happiness"" another Todd Solondz movie which leaves you with the same uncomfortable feeling. You get to see people in some of their rather low and ugly moments.
The second part is termed ""non fiction"" but seemed a lot more fabricated to me... so many things happen to all the characters that I have to admit I remained ""emotionally indifferent"". I am not trying to say that I did not like the story or found it uninteresting, on the contrary. Its just that what happened on the screen, starting with the telephone call between Toby Oxman, an aspiring producer (who works in a shoe store in order to make a living) and his high school friend and ending in the last terrible scene - was just too grotesque for me to identify with.
 I have to stress again that I did like this part; I enjoyed the acting, especially John Goodman who is one of my favorite actors (and off course I laugh whenever I see him on screen even if the scene is rather tragic). I just remained as a non involved viewer who watches the film ""neutrally"" without taking sides (something that did happen on the first part) because all is too ""far fetched"" for me . This part tells the story of Scooby, a passive indifferent teenager who is filmed by Toby as someone who is in the dramatic ""College application stage"". Scooby does not want to go to College and is only trying to please his father (John Goodman). Scooby's personal story and the family events that follow could have been portrayed as a tragedy but the producer keeps looking for the funny side. In a way I felt that what I sensed (or rather not sensed) while watching ""Storytelling"" is similar to what the producer in the movie inside the movie, was trying to create. The producer keeps asking his friend ""...but isn't this funny? are these not funny parts...?"" ""No"" answers his friend - ""you have a tragedy here"". Toby's film however, is accepted in the trial viewing as a comedy. I feel the conversation described above also explains what I felt - is this sad? Is this grotesque? Is it funny? Is it ok to laugh?. As in the first part this piece does not show people at their best. There is not one compassionate character in this part and all characters seem to get their punishment.",1057536000,,3738,4.604197901049475
1444140,5,B00005JKJG,"Storytelling, based on two acts, on first glance may appear to be somewhat unreleated. But there are fine points to the ever downward spiraling hell that is Todd Solondz's vision.
In part one we see the story of a disfigured and disabled student and his lover, she doesn't want to hear his revised story. Things start sinking with their eventual breakup. This leads to an encounter that is humiliating and in a story characterized as rape. More bad things happen and we get to examine what exactly is 'fiction' and 'reality'?
The answer depends upon the viewer. One take is the humiliation is a form of rape, if not physical, then emotional. And there is no question that issue is fair game, but so is the choice the character makes in a series of smaller humiliations which leads to her crushing experience. Or perhaps the another train of thought is don't get involved with self-absorbed (fill in your favorite invective).
The second, longer segment is about a slacker type filmmaker. He has a mid-life issue and focuses on school days 20 years ago, in particular High School. This leads him on a search for a subject which he finds after some rejections. Eventually he finds his subject in Scooby, a seemingly lost person that doesn't seem all that removed from his documentor.
As the documentary unfolds and we see the life beyond the documentary we meet the seemingly normal American nuclear family. We see the disagreements between siblings, the disinterest between family members and their various stages of being out of touch with reality...courtesy of, that's right, suburbia. Now this could easily be a film killer as Solodnz has done three films about (sub)uban decay and has managed to outrage and get laughs at the expense of this sub-culture. Thankfully there is some seeming self-deprecation in this segment of Storytelling.
As the plot progresses betrayals of all kinds and sizes occur with different results concluding in a - depending on your way of thinking - ironic or sick ending. I lean towards ironic and intentionally ambigious to one of the major characters. There seems to be a lot of self awareness in Storytelling, the other thing that could easily kill a film. What keeps this film fresh is it's black humor and it's premise.
In the end the meaning between both parts of the whole is fiction is just another form of reality, that those that want to ignore parts of their existance do so and lead a fictional life. Conversely, those that deal in fiction find themselves within the story whether intentional or not. The way we percieve reality and fiction are a fine line and one Storytelling does a fine job of getting across even if it isn't evident immediately.",1053561600,,2691,4.8268398268398265
1444141,4,B00005JKJG,"I accept ""Fiction"" as an enjoyable and funny parable.  I liked it, which is something I can't say about Solondz' first two films.
But ""Nonfiction"" seems pretty incoherent.  What's he trying to say?  He's trying to mute criticism that he sees himself above others, by making fun of himself, Woody Allen-style.  He's poking fun at suburban life.  He's poking fun at slackers.  He's poking fun at ""American Beauty"".  He's reminding us of ""Dollhouse"" with the precocious young boy.  He gives us some genuinely humorous moments here, then ends the whole thing in an ugly way at the end, inexplicably and to no purpose I can discern.
It has its moments, and the first half-hour clicks.  Maybe next time Solondz can come to some point?",1049155200,3,728,4.806451612903226
1444142,4,B00005JKJG,"Although this third film by Todd Solondz is not as good as ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"" or ""Happiness"", it still smacks of satirical cynicism. Inexplicably split into two films ('Fiction', 'Non-fiction'), we are first presented with a twenty minute film about community college level 'writing', in which, a young woman has a confrontational and sexual sparring with the black, 'mandingo' teacher. It's all meant to be a comment on hypocritical racists in education. It culminates in an outrageous sex encounter that is literally 'blocked' by a large red rectangle (taboo emphasis). It's moderately entertaining.
The second part of the film is more complex. Without exposing too much of the plot, it involves (as ""Happiness"" did) classism, racism, sexism, oh hell, any 'ism' you could imagine. But it works. It is simply a story of an upper middle class American family with the 2.5 kids and the proper suburban parents with a perfect son, the 'imperfect' son and the 'baby'. Kudos to John Goodman and Julie Haggerdy for participating in this movie. They bring life and legitimacy to their roles. Solondz filmed this well before ""reality TV"" was popular, and that is the premise. While the imperfect son is being secretly filmed for a documentary, the family struggles through it's own unusually tragic existence (the youngest of the three sons is the 'Brady Bunch brat' we always thought we wanted to see as evil). Needless to say, Solondz produces many shocks and surprises along the way. The trip is wildly entertaining, but the finale may leave the viewer distraught.

1444204,3,B00005JKJG,"Some filmmakers like to deal with the 'supernormal'--super heroes, space travel, etc.  Other filmmakers (like Neil LaBute's early work) deal with the 'extra-normal.' These characters exist outside the boundaries of real life, as in most other films. But extra-normal characters exist in some muted universe where there is no hope.  Basically, on one end of the film spectrum is the hope and humanity-filled escapism of Indiana Jones and Spider-Man and on the other, distant, end is ""Happiness"" or ""Storytelling""--films by the less optimistic of us like Todd Solondz.
Somehow I've seen all three of Solondz's films, even though I'm not a big fan of his style. In a way, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" is still his best. It introduced the world to Solondz's way of shocking his audience with...people. All of his films have a way of shocking you with yourself. On one hand you're surprised at what you will laugh at (I saw ""Happiness"" in a packed theater and the house was rolling--not snickering, but all out stomach cramping laughter) and on the other you're shocked at what the people on screen are doing. These things aren't shocking in a way that makes an evening newscast. The shock is in the familiarity. Through Solondz's version of reality you discover things about the one you live in. That's why many are so unnerved by this writer/director's material. They're the kind of films that make some really squirm in their seats.
Solondz's skill as a filmmaker is obvious. What he craves more than anything is to get the audience to REACT. I watched the Storytelling DVD (It was only released in NY and LA and I live in neither) by myself but I could almost hear the audience react at certain points. You can pick up the cues and know Solondz has put that reaction shot, or written that particular line, for a specific reason.
""Storytelling"" is really two films. The first, shorter film, titled ""Fiction"" gets your attention quickly. Don't expect to find anyone to like. Some of the best films (or books, stories, plays) feature an ensemble of characters who all have drastically different perceptions of each other. You're going to hate everyone in ""Fiction."" I did. But you're also going to laugh a few times and find the characters interesting. The audience has the advantage of seeing everything everyone does, so we can see the contradictions the characters can't. The writing class is like a microcosm of a Solondz film audience. The class, like Solondz's films, weeds out the most pretentious of its members.
""Fiction"" comes and goes quickly enough, and is a good primer for the next chapter, ""Non-fiction."" This film explores the life of a documentary filmmaker who decides to do a piece on high school students' outlook on things after the Columbine massacre. He changes it to a piece about getting into college, settling for Scooby, the first student he comes across (in a bathroom) as the subject.  Solondz finds new ways to plumb the depths of cruelty and does it through, for one, a 15 year-old kid (Scooby's youngest brother).  The things these characters do to each other are fascinating and shocking, but ring true all the same.

It's unclear what Solondz really believes about the world and its ""smartest"" species. His world isn't some twisted version of reality, nor is it an absolute truth. It's somewhere in between.",1043884800,,3335,4.895575221238938

1444207,3,B00005JKJG,"""Storytelling,"" a film written and directed by Todd Solondz, is actually made up of a pair of stories combined into a single work.  The first, entitled ""Fiction,"" is the shorter and lesser in quality of the two, telling the tale of a waiflike young college student who, tired of relationships that seem to go nowhere, finds herself having a kinky, almost racist sexual encounter with her black writing professor, then using the experience as source material for one of her amateur stories.  Selma Blair does a beautiful job in the role of Vi, a quiet, taciturn girl who finds herself drawn to an experience she quickly comes to regret.  Even though she is a ""willing partner"" in what happens to her, she also comes to see the exploitative nature of the event.  When she attempts to confront the professor by reading her tale in the writers' workshop session he is hosting, she discovers that few of the other writers are able to see the story for what it is and dismiss it as trite, racist and exploitative fiction.  That seems to be the theme of this first episode - that everything becomes fiction once it is committed to paper - but because the episode itself is so short, it somehow feels underdeveloped and incomplete.  Despite the excellence performances and the assuredness of the direction, this opening section comes across more as a clever conceit than as a fully developed work in its own right.
The second story, which is almost twice as long as the first, creates much more of an impact, due largely to the fact that it gives itself more time for the development of character, milieu and theme.  In this tale, entitled, not surprisingly, ""Nonfiction,"" Solondz presents us with a view of an upper middle class suburban family caught in major crisis.  The story focuses on young Scooby Livingston, a high school senior so devoid of ambition, drive and motivation, that he is literally drifting through life, indifferent to family, school, peers, anything but his pie-in-the-sky dream of becoming a talk show host like Conan O'Brien (who makes a fun cameo appearance in the film).  Scooby's family resides in one of those perfectly manicured suburban residences replete with a maid from Central America whom the family members either ignore or treat with hurtful disdain (the mean-spirited action of the youngest son in this regard provides one of the truly disturbing, haunting moments of the film). Solondz does a beautiful job conveying the quiet desperation that defines so many lives lived behind such suburban facades.  Scooby's parents are at a loss to understand why their sterile home environment fails to elicit the responses they think it should from their oldest son.  Paul Giamatti plays Toby Oxman, a wannabe documentary filmmaker who decides to make a movie about Scooby's attempts to get into college.  Toby is a man whose life has not turned out the way he had imagined it would.  Unmarried, living with a roommate, and working as a clerk at a local shoe store, Toby latches onto the Livingston family as his ticket to fame and fortune.  By the end of the film, Toby has gotten more than he bargained for as the family weathers some amazing crises and even provides him with the perfect ""finale"" for his nearly completed work.
""Nonfiction"" takes a number of surprising turns, not all of which are entirely convincing or credible, but the film is more interesting for its characterizations and milieu than for its plotting.  Scooby is representative of many of today's apathetic young people, cut off from both his own emotions and the emotions of those around him.  Young Mark Webber captures Scooby's passive, glassy-eyed exterior perfectly.  Equally impressive are John Goodman and Julie Haggerty as Scooby's well-meaning but hopelessly ineffective parents, who simply can't understand why their son fails to share any of their basic values.  Jonathan Osser, as Scooby's youngest brother, Mikey, is a revelation, a smart kid who seems, on the surface, to be warm and caring, but who can, with cold calculation, destroy another human being without a moment's regret or hesitation.
As a director, Solondz creates an atmosphere and a world that is raw, stark and sterile, utterly drained of happiness and joy.  In fact, I don't think a single character ever smiles in the course of either of the two stories (with the exception of Scooby and, of course, Conan, in the former's fantasy sequences).  These are people sealed off from the possibility of happiness, who are just going through the motions because the only other alternative is death.  As such, the film is, in many ways, a disturbing and depressing experience, but one that offers some valuable insights into human nature.  You may not want to live in the world Solondz is showing us, but you may want to visit it for a short time to perhaps see how much better your own life is.",1041724800,5,4866,4.886998784933171

Scooby, the dude who's smoked away all his ambitions and might want to be a TV talk show host. His cookie cutter family. The Pulitzer Prize winning teacher who enjoys humiliating his students. It's almost as if Solondz randomly selected click-art from the DSM-IV to populate this spectacle.
Yet, the self-referential nature of the product, the way Solondz dares to show film-making as a confounding of vision and object, makes one wonder ... could it be ""Genius?"" I do love it when a film commits the same sins it ostracizes in its characters. This one swallows its tail over and over again, committing the stereotyping, the racism, the loss of focus for which it blames its players.
Frankly, I don't know. Perhaps we need an unsophisticated child to turn off the TV and tell us that the Emperor is really naked. But that would be too obvious, wouldn't it?
The DVD lets you choose between widescreen and pan-and-scan, between the theatrical release and the director's cut.

1444272,3,B00005JKJG,"""Storytelling"" appears to take the same vicious aim as ""Happiness"", but fails to stand on its own as either a continuation of that movie or a fresh indictment of the human animal under pressure to behave civilized as it navigates privilege and affluence. Indeed, if you have already seen ""Happiness"", you will not be shocked at all by the new vulnerablities Solondz is attempting to expose. In fact, you'll be confused as to the point of all of it, because the premise of the movie is wrapped up in some sort of juxtaposition of creators of fiction and nonfiction that few will understand. That leaves you, the viewer left with the rest of the subtexts in the film and the Solondz signature of not backing away when the characters do something subhuman. It'll give you a few things to think and talk about, and the drama is definitely bracing at times,but it is in no way the gut punch that ""Happiness"" was nor is it a new angle on the pathos of perversity. Oh, if any of you are easily offended by controversy, especially of a sexual nature, I don't suggest you ever, ever be curious about this or any other Solondz works. Just a warning for the unaware.",1031443200,,1155,4.5311004784688995
1444273,5,B00005JKJG,"All I can say is WOW! With each consecutive film that Todd Solondz creates, the subject gets more interesting, the atmosphere gets more uncomfortable and tense...I thought this movie was great!
Divided into two unrelated stories, one is ""fiction,"" the other is non-fiction.
I think it's interesting how the first story is called fiction. It's about a writing student, Vi, who ultimately writes her best story based on a real experience. Yet her teacher, Mr. Scott, says, ""It may have actually happened, but once you write it down...it's fiction."" I never thought of it that way. There are two versions, a rated and unrated. Personally I prefer to see the unrated version of any movie because that is ultimately what the director envisioned, that's what he or she wants us to see. The most disturbing scene is of course the sex scene between Vi and Mr. Scott, where she is forced to scream racist obscenities in the act. However, I think that it's a pretty raw representation of how a person who thinks she is open-minded, worldly and unprejudiced, clearly is often kidding herself.
The second story, ""non-fiction"" is a little funnier, about a down-and-out documentarian who wants to film the typical family/student growing up in 21st century suburbia. I can't say that I know what it's like to look at the world through the eyes of one who grew up as a total outcast, but it seems to me that Solondz' take on life in suburbia is way too exaggerated. For example, that little kid, Mikey, is freakishly evil. His mother, beautifully portrayed by Julie Hagerty, is like a cookie cut version of a Barbie sans personality and all. However, it's possible that the exaggeration was necessary in order to illustrate a point that people living in or growing up in that environment can be quite sheltered, ignorant of the rest of the world less privileged, hypocritical.
This film goes quickly, it feels like it ended so suddenly. Now that I think about it though, it probably ended right where it was most necessary. I also think whoever was in charge of casting this film was right on...excellent cast all the way through.
The humor, in classic-Solondz form, is DARK, biting and hits hard. Again, as with Happiness, this film is not at all for the lighthearted. Please be mindful of the fact that if there is ANYTHING that may offend you, Solondz will find it in one of his films. I know of no other filmmaker who is able to take the concept of ""no sacred cows"" as far as he can...and I think that's good. None of these more ""offensive"" issues are done strictly to be gratuitous. He films them in a way that almost seems, dare I say, tasteful?!
""Storytelling"" has a lot of depth in terms of what motivations people have to do the things they do. It makes me think about our belief systems, our morals, our ""issues,"" and why we have them. It makes me think about how authentic people really are with each other, how much of themselves, emotionally, intellectually and otherwise, people are willing to admit to the rest of the world.",1030838400,5,3023,4.694915254237288
1444274,3,B00005JKJG,"I really like Todd Solondz, I loved Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse.  I was really disappointed after watching Storytelling.  Storytelling is 2 movies, fiction and non fiction.  I feel it would have been better to expand on one of the movies (I would rather non fiction) because both movies felt really incomplete.  I like Leo Fitzpatrick, and thought he was great in Kids and Bully, but I felt his performance in fiction was very weak.  Fiction really was a waste, and non fiction could have been a great story had Solondz invested a little more time working on that.  The entire Storytelling movie is only 84 minutes, which is short for one movie and he put two in there.
Storytelling comes off as two unfinished scripts that Solondz had laying around that he decided to stick together.  Let's just say it didn't turn out quite as well as it did for the Beatles with A Day in the Life.",1030233600,,894,4.55
1444275,5,B00005JKJG,"I can't believe people are giving this film 1 star. Storytelling is one of the best films I've seen in a while. Yes it's disturbing -- yes it's at times shocking -- and yes maybe even a scene or two were a bit unnecessary, but director Todd Solondz is brave enough to take that extra step to keep the viewer engaged by showing them the unexpected. This movie is unlike anything you'll ever see - a ""Fiction"" and ""Nonfiction"" story put together in one movie, both being able to capture your attention. Before you pass on this movie based on all the 1-star reviews, give it a chance. You may just enjoy this very different film.",1028505600,12,626,4.405172413793103
1444276,5,B00005JKJG,"To me, the meaning behind the Fiction/Non-Fiction split is to point out the irony that the ""Fiction"" story uses more realism and the ""Non-Fiction"" story is so over-the-top, it couldn't be real.",1028505600,2,193,5.0625
1444277,5,B00005JKJG,"So sad, today, the state of cinema.  In a world where we live, where A Beautiful Mind can win best picture and Denzel Washington can win best actor for playing a bad guy-in a world where we think ""blax-poitation"" films are a thing of the past (what would you call the funny black guy with the serious white guy?  That just won't die... see the box office cash register for RUSH HOUR 1 and 2) and when we're told Steven Speilberg is ""A great Storyteller""- the guy doesn't even write his scripts... what stories does he tell? When screenwriters and directors are hired after the stars have signed up for the films... accept all of this... then watch this beatiful piece of work... it is one of the best, and most important things I've seen in a long time... and ya know what?  A select few will EVER see it.. such a shame.",1028419200,5,820,4.34640522875817
1444278,4,B00005JKJG,"Storytelling is a typical Todd Solondz fare. Solondz is incredibly deft at placing an unflinching eye on the dark, disturbing undercurrents of everyday life that we all experience yet only discuss in therapy sessions. Humor in disturbing situations; misfits, outcasts and misunderstood individuals and a keen, satirical sense of suburban life abound throughout as in every Solondz film.  However, if you're expecting 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' or 'Happiness' then Storytelling will disappoint.  It falls short at reaching the highs of past films, yet still maintains that familiar edge.
Storytelling's only problem is its sense of balance.  Divided into two parts, Fiction and NonFiction, the Fiction half lasts about 20 minutes.  A strange story of a girl who has a humiliating sexual encounter with her Black creative writing teacher that she later writes about.  The NonFiction half lasts well over an hour, a tense account of the ""perfect"" suburban family slowly and tragically disintegrating in front a documentary camera crew.
The balance should have been attained through either a sense of continuity between the stories or, as another reviewer mentioned, at least one or two more vignettes.  When the credits rolled I felt disappointed that there wasn't at least one more tale to tell.  In in any case, Storytelling is Solondz in top form.  Proof postive that Solondz is an excellent storyteller.",1027987200,7,1404,5.321266968325792
1444279,1,B00005JKJG,"I won't bother reviewing much of the actual film other than that i think the 2 halves of the movie never really gel together like they're supposed to (or are they?). Transfer of film to DVD is pretty grainy in some scenes(the nighttime ones). The back of the box claims ""animated menus"" but all i saw were standard NON-animated menus. I also found this DVD to be very skimpy in extras. For example, there's no director's commentary. Probably the worst thing is that the deleted scenes are excluded from the disc. The original version of the film was roughly an hour longer and featured another vignette featuring James Van Der Beek. Todd Solondz was apparently upset over the producer's cuts and blamed them for the film's lukewarm response. So where are the scenes that would complete Solondz vision? Apparently, not on this disc.",1027900800,5,831,4.818181818181818

Its not a feel good film but theres some dark humor and some good acting. Its a slice of life and a lot more real than how lives are often glossed over in mainstream films.,1524355200,,511,3.876190476190476

If you're a Howard Stern listener, theres a clip from this movie youll recognize. Maybe they still use it, I stopped listening after decades when Howard abandoned the show to be a stupid tv host.",1517529600,,501,4.4021739130434785

Now watching it again at an older age, I really liked it.  It's not your normal film but, feels like two short films in juxtaposition.  What I really liked about it was how well it bottled up all the underlying tones from a college writing class, as well as a dysfunctional suburban family.  Solondz has a way of creating characters that are incredibly comic yet tragic in a slurry that comes off as authentic.

For me this one was a spark in the dark of modern movies.",1508630400,,547,4.221153846153846
7939131,5,B00005JKJG,"The first story ""Fiction is harsh, disarming, its focus the students and teacher of a writing class on a college campus-- the teacher Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom), a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. That descriptor is one of a number of details significant in spotlighting the role societal symbols play in influencing behavior. The contemptuous and demeaning manner of the teacher seems to set the tone for his students' negativity and sharp edges. Something startling happens, but I leave it to your viewing.  Solondz, as in other films of his, writes a character with some visible disability. Here it is Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick), a student with cerebral palsy. And even though he is included in the free-for-all of quirky satire, he is ascribed no pitiable status. In ""Wiener Dog,"" 2 characters have Down syndrome, and they are both depicted as competently functioning adults. Yes, Solondz likes to surprise, but inclusivity is what's apparent, not highlighting the disparity (In honesty, I did find Dawns experience too painful in Welcome to the Dollhouse).  There are so many important aspects to this piece:  the role of truth vs. fiction, the influence of societal norms and expectations, the focus on the analysis of the writing and the failure to notice the person doing the writing. You will see the paradox in the 2 titles. This first story is so intense and skillfully written, I couldn't start the 2nd without a long think and a short rest.  ""Non-Fiction"" is the 2nd story, in which a shoe salesman/ part-time ""documentarian"" wings a film based on the last idea that occurs to him, as he's always willing to ""reconceive."" So he follows a highly disorganized (the new term for dysfunctional) family vis-a-vis the eldest son, Scooby (Mark Webber), a very uninspired graduating high school student.  The acting is top-notch in both stories, including the performances of Selma Blair, Paul Giamatti, John Goodman, and many more. All filmmaking disciplines are in sync and successful.
