8134966,3,B000GWLFZQ,"I purchased this movie after having seen Paz Vega in ""10 Items
or less"". ""Say I Do"", is about a sexy unknown actress being teamed
up with a dorky cinema usher on a dating game type reality game show in Spain.

Paz Vega is excellant as the ""sexy actress"", she is a born comedian, but
the dorky usher is just too dorky. He doesn't seem to realize he is with
this stunning beautiful charming woman. He treats her as if she is a pest,
which is just too hard to believe.

On a side note, I have now seen Paz Vega in 'Spanglish', '10 Items or
Less', and now in 'Say I Do'.....and in each movie she portrays a totally
different character. She is a brilliant actress. She should have recieved
an Acadamy Award nomination for Spanglish.....Just my opinion.",1254441600,,747,4.366906474820144
8134967,2,B000GWLFZQ,"Spanish film ""Di Que S"" is a very silly comedy, but everyone expects certain amount of silliness from this kind of comedy, so let's forget about it. More lamentable is the fact that the filmmakers are not aware that they are only wasting two talented actors here - Paz Vega and Santi Milln -- with this absolutely clueless direction that misses every opportunity to make it a better, funnier film.

Not that the film's script is a hopeless case. ""Di Que S"" begins with a mildly interesting introduction, in which a nerdy 36-year-old movie theater usher Victor (Santi Milln), and feisty wannabe actress Estrella (Paz Vega) meets each other on a TV show called `Say Yes To Love' as mistakenly chosen ""contestants."" That is, Victor and Esterella are supposed to spend a week together as prospective husband and wife, and if they say `I do' at the next week's program, they win the money. The point is, uptight Victor and free and easy Estrealla have nothing in common, being totally opposite to one another.

Now I want to ask you a simplest question - what should Victor do (and Victor is not a gay)? Most incredibly, Victor seems unaware that he is standing in front of one of the most beautiful, gorgeous, and sexiest women in the world, and remains sulky all the time while as if to justify his reaction, Paz Vega's character sometimes acts so unnatural wearing Japanese kimono to have dinner at sushi restraunt.

In addition to the clichd and tasteless way of showing the `opposite' personalities (like smoking and non-smoking), the film fails to understand that even the silliest comedies need certain amount of common sense, which ""Di Que S"" doesn't have. A week with Paz Vega in the sunny seaside hotel? Who is going to refuse it? The film can never answer this inevitable question while the obvious choice is there, that is, creating more plausible characters.

To make matters worse, a ridiculous subplot about the guard who impersonates `The Terminator' only makes things worse and intolerable. I don't pretend to say that I know Spanish comedies, and I don't think I fully understand the sensitivity behind the scenes about the small man in black leather jacket chasing the van driven by Paz Vega. I can say with confidence that it does not happen very often in Spain, but I am not sure that every Spanish people found it so funny as the film thinks.

Perhaps fans of the marvelous actress would enjoy this tactlessly made film, which is certainly pleasant to see with Paz Vega in bikini. But to say yes to the impossible film as the title suggests is too much even for her avid fans.",1156377600,,2593,4.71523178807947
