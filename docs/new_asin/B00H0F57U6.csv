8629025,4,B00H0F57U6,"Hong Kong film director Dante Lam may be best known for the stylish crime noirs like The Beast Stalker and The Stool Pigeon, but (Ji zhan) he tries something different in Unbeatable, which is a more light-hearted and upbeat drama (though the films fight sequences are very intense).

Ching Fai (Nick Cheung) is a 48-year-old former boxing champion. Now disgraced and in debt with gangsters, he flees Hong Kong and goes to Macau, where he starts a new life as a boxing coach at his friends gym. There he meets a young boxer Lin Siqi (Eddie Peng), who wants to join an upcoming MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) tournament called the ""Golden Rumble"" and asks Ching Fai to teach how to fight.

In the meanwhile, Ching Fai befriends a precocious little girl Liang Peidan (very delightful Crystal Lee), whose mother has been mentally unstable since a tragic event.

At first sight Dante Lams Unbeatable is about MMA (and the fighting scenes featuring Nick Cheung and Eddie Peng are credible), but the film is actually a drama about the struggles of flawed characters trying to regain their dignity and purpose of life.

I admit the story itself is not very original for those who know the name of Rocky Balboa, especially his first and last films (supposing there is no sequel in the future), but told with humor and sentimentality, the film offers a surprisingly emotional experience.",1426636800,,1371,4.821276595744681
