2663775,1,B000IU37TS,"go to youtube, watch the mad tv dane cook parody.  then listen to this, and try to tell the difference.  betcha a million bucks you can't!

dane cook USED to be funny, but his act has worn EXTREMELY thin.  he's hit COMPLETELY rock bottom.  i have a big sense of humor.  even though i know he stole jokes from louis c.k. and wanted to bed jessica simpson, i could look past all that IF HE WAS ACTUALLY FUNNY.  but he's not.  not anymore. a totally ""phoned-in"" performance.  dane has the last laugh.  he writes ""observational"" jokes that actually aren't observations on life at all.. and he laughs all the way to the bank.  i'd advise you to stick with his performances before this, unless you like disappointment.",1163548800,12,712,4.52755905511811
2663776,5,B000IU37TS,"I was at Dane's show and I suggest everyone should get this DVD. The 90 minute HBO special was hilarious, but you HAVE to watch the extended concert (the one I was at) because most of the funniest jokes of the night weren't even put in the 90 minute show. For example, the pumpkin bomb skit. So if you are a serious Dane fan, you have to get this, it's worth it.",1163203200,10,362,4.041666666666667
2663777,5,B000IU37TS,"I saw this show live when it was taped in Boston, and I can honestly say that Dane Cook never ceases to amaze me.  It's easy to categorize his act as simply catering towards obnoxious frat boys, but Dane Cook has brought the life back to comedy with his unique approach and brilliant use of words.  Not to mention that his delivery is always spot on.  I had grown tired of the typical simplistic humor of the sort that has become the norm on SNL and other ""comedy"" shows. But Dane Cook's performances are refreshing to watch because he makes the act what it is; only he could perform his act and pull it off without looking like he's trying too hard. He is simply an amazing comedian and there is a reason why he was named one of Time's Top 100 Most Influential People and also one of Forbes' Top 100 Celebrities. This DVD is definitely worth the buy. He uses his classic material from previously released CD's (which never loses its hilariousness), but he also busts out a lot of new stuff that is just as good, if not better.  So buy the DVD, see it in theaters on 11/27/06 if you can, and prepare yourself for non-stop laughs.  Support the guy because he's awesome and he adores his fans! SUFI!!!",1162944000,10,1199,4.358744394618834

2663807,4,B000IU37TS,"I thought this was the one I saw on comedy central a couple yrs ago, but why are the 2 scenes that I remember the most isn't on the dvd (I got the 2 disc)?

The 1st one is when he talks about going online 2 look 2 see if he had a convicted rapist in his apartment complex.  He joked that what if once he click 2 see there would be a million red dots (oh yea, he talked about Oprah tellin u 2 go 2 the site & he said don't do it) & they know your lookin.  He joked that they would say ""THE GUY IN APARTMENT 3B KNOWS.  LETS GET HIM""

The other 1 I remember is how if their is something wrong w/a guys ""junk"" & he tells his friend.  The friend would lie & say oh thats nothing wrong your probably allergic 2 your detergent.

Please someone correct me if Im wrong....that this was the special that had those 2 jokes",1374278400,,811,3.820359281437126
2663808,1,B000IU37TS,"If you really like this, you seriously need Surgery of your humor or you don't know comedy at all. Dane Cook's long ""jokes"", lacks of timing and weak material is the perfect combination for suicidal people.

2663814,5,B000IU37TS,If you are a Dane Cook fan this video is a must have. I watched it with a few friends and the laughter never stopped. Dane Cook is fun to listen to but with his dvd he is taken to a whole new level. To watch him perform is 100% entainment. I will be watching this one again and again.,1305590400,,284,3.75

2663820,1,B000IU37TS,"Honestly, I do not know. If he didn't move erratically and jirate himself all around the stage, he wouldn't have a job. And his ""jokes"" take an inordinate amount of time to come to fruition, if you can even call it that. Seems that everyone I know absolutely loves him, and I honestly cannot figure out why...if you want a funny comedian with thoughtful, enciteful and actually FUNNY jokes, check out Lewis Black, or better yet, check out the man who Mr. Cook stole jokes from - Louis C.K.",1255305600,6,489,4.50561797752809

2663824,3,B000IU37TS,he's a little too funny. i was laughing so hard at his joke about the road signs that one of my lungs burst. was in intense care unit for 3 months after that :(,1250035200,,160,3.735294117647059
2663825,4,B000IU37TS,"I'm a fan of Dane Cook. I originally saw Vicious Circle on TV, loved it, and wanted to own it. I bought the DVD recently, and it was a good choice.

A warning: don't watch this with your parents or younger kids. It gets pretty raunchy. He goes into detail about sex, masturbation, and some other thngs . . . so I warned you!

This DVD also has a second disc, which plays the entire show with deleted scenes included. One scene features two girls that get up on stage and start kissing each other. That was dumb. I have no problem with homosexuality, but I think it's stupid when girls ""pretend"" to be a lesbians just to get attention. It was a pointless interruption. I'll just opt for the first disc from now on. Nonetheless, Dane Cook is good at what he does.

It also helps that Dane Cook is easy on the eyes. I've watched the entire show more than once and I still laugh. And to top it off, I have a nice view.

Overall, I recommend it to anyone who likes or tolerates his liberal sense of humor.",1245715200,,1000,4.192708333333333

2663827,5,B000IU37TS,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend because I love Dane Cook and I thought he would enjoy this DVD.  He said the DVD was hilarious and that the best stuff wasn't even part of the HBO special it was in the extras.  So if you like Dane Cook you'll want to pick up this DVD.,1242518400,,276,3.7413793103448274
2663828,5,B000IU37TS,"Hilarious, D.C. is super funny. Two disc DVD, long and brutally funny, If you like dane cook you will enjoy this dvd! One of the best out there among many boring modern comedians.",1242000000,,179,4.454545454545454
2663829,5,B000IU37TS,"I saw Dane Cook at a friend's house while dog-sitting and absolutely loved it. I had to buy it, so I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. We both watch it all the time.",1231200000,,173,3.9714285714285715
2663830,4,B000IU37TS,"I have watched all of Dane's other comedy routines, and this is by far his best one.  This DVD has several deleted scenes, which are worth the purchase price alone.  Highly recommended to any fan of Dane Cook.",1230336000,,209,4.473684210526316
2663831,5,B000IU37TS,"This is a great stand up video of Dane Cook, the stories he tells is quite like the stand up from Eddie Murphy in the 80's, but, is original. A great date flick,or, if you just want to laugh until you cry, Dane Cook can do that. Great story telling and lots of energy, this DVD is a must have for comedy lovers!",1225411200,,311,3.9523809523809526
2663832,3,B000IU37TS,"Dane Cook proves that a stand up comedian can get the same reactions from an audience as a rockstar. Great show, but those of you that don't live in the US should either get an American DVD-player, or just watch it on your computer.",1222905600,,232,4.295454545454546
2663833,1,B000IU37TS,"When the camera followed Dane from the dressing room to the stage in this performance, he looked troubled.  After the performance, I could see why.  He isn't funny anymore, and I think he knows it.  He spends 10 minutes on a story about a guy who invites him to a party, he lies and says he will be there and doesnt show up.  This story, like all the other ""jokes"" in this show, meanders on and on and on and never arrives at anything resembling a point or a punch line. He attempts over and over to describe real life situations we can all relate to, but he fails miserably to offer unique insights to make these situations funny.  Dane Cook was funny early in his career, but he is out of gas.  Dane laughs at his jokes way more than I did.  Waste of time.",1215302400,12,758,4.1506849315068495
2663834,5,B000IU37TS,This is one of Dane Cook's best performances. Awesome stand up comedy performance by Dane Cook. It is great how he correlates everyday life into his jokes. The guy is truly talented.,1214265600,,182,4.71875
2663835,1,B000IU37TS,"If you have see one Dane Cook stand up rountine you have seen them all. Same over the top jumping around and noises, same lack of any real jokes.

I don't understand his popularity. I keep giving him another try but I just don't laugh.

I would suggest checking out anything by Louis C.K. or Bob Kelly, both are much funnier.",1212192000,7,325,4.311475409836065
2663836,5,B000IU37TS,"Love the item I bought...but then again that is why I bought it! However, for this purchase, the service from Amazon was slower than I am used to when buying from them.",1210809600,,168,4.28125
2663837,4,B000IU37TS,This video is hilarious! You have to watch the DANEgerous version. There are a lot of good deleted scenes.,1206489600,,106,4.631578947368421
2663838,3,B000IU37TS,The show was pretty funny and he talks about some crazy things. It is not a bad movie but you have to have a certain type of humor to appreciate Dane Cook.,1205712000,,155,3.875
2663839,5,B000IU37TS,"This is by far some if his best stuff, even funner if you are showing it to other people that have never seen him before. Its something for young adults though. You will find youself thinking or saying ""that is so true"" Because a lot of what he talks about can relate to you. Good Stuff",1205107200,,286,4.125
2663840,4,B000IU37TS,Very enjoyable for me and my wife. We would recommend this to anyone with any sense of humor. The best thing about purchasing the dvd is that you can pause to let your sides recover- then let the laughs continue!,1203206400,,212,4.325
2663841,1,B000IU37TS,"I honestly wish I could give this product a lower rating. Dane Cook is a horrible, un funny ""Comedian"" who has gotten famous from other people's work. He is like that guy you know that thinks he is funny, but is just annoying, if you like comedy, don't listen to Dane Cook, because he ruins comedy with his ""jokes"" and ""funny"" sound effects.",1201392000,11,341,4.428571428571429

Grab your friends and hit the sofa to watch this extremely ""laugh-out-loud"" comedy special featuring some of Dane's greatest hits (children's names, one-night-stand, etc.) and some side-splitting new ones!

2663844,5,B000IU37TS,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, so here's her review:
""I absolutely love dane cook and all his little jokes. I love how he can make a joke out of anything and i also love his interaction with the audience. I like how he isn't demeaning to races, his jokes are mainly sexist, and as a women i find them quite halarious. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time just laughing.

2663845,1,B000IU37TS,"Ok, this was the first dvd I ever bought of his stand up and I was hugely disappointed. I thought this had the jokes from his cd, Retalation (if anyone knows where I can find a dvd version of this stand up, please tell me. I found that one funny), but I made a mistake and it didn't really bother me. I seen him a few years back (2003) on a cruise ship and he was funny. This dvd...is not. My only question is, how long does it take him to get to the point of a joke? I understand comedians telling stories and I like it, but it takes Cook almost 20 minutes to finish one joke. He jumps to other topics (Windextor?) that is almost related, but not that funny. The pace is too slow.",1198368000,7,681,3.978102189781022
2663846,4,B000IU37TS,"I'm not exactly an expert, but I thought Dane Cook's ""Vicious Circle"" special was pretty funny...I couldn't breathe during some parts.

2663847,1,B000IU37TS,"This has to be the least funny stand up act ever. This guy is a product of pure hype. What is supposed to be funny about ""I'm gonna go home and cry""? What a sniveling idiot. These people who paid top dollar for this snooze-fest were probably convincing themselves to laugh out of some sense of denial. If I paid , I might as well laugh. No. I could find a funeral more amusing than this goober.",1197158400,18,394,4.12987012987013

The humor is directed at the college crowd, but he's energetic, has a great delivery, and puts on a show that's compelling.  I first caught part of this DVD at a party where the beer was flowing, but finally watched the whole thing at home with a friend.  Funnier with the beer, but still worth the price.",1195257600,,369,4.242857142857143

I even found the Tourgasm series very funny, which a lot of people didn't seem to like.  I was happy when I heard about Vicious Circle coming on HBO but when I watched it, I just didn't like it.  I wanted to like it, but by the time he got to the actual joke after a long-drawn out, boring unrealistic story, it killed the joke for me.  The crying bit was annoying, the ""B+E"" bit wasn't funny, everything about it just kind of annoyed me rather than made me laugh.  The little things were funny which is why I gave this 2 stars, but I hope his next set of material is better, and if he does one hour shows rather than 90 minutes shows, hes probably better off cause he can cut out all the build-up.",1172880000,2,848,4.177914110429448

I had heard he was hysterical, the next great thing in comedy. But OMG. This is just not that funny. My 18 year son laughed a bit, even my 50 year husband laughed once. I thought it was unfunny, lame, derivative,and unworthy of a such a huge audience. But that's just my opinion. Obviously,I could be wrong. He sure is cute though.",1172793600,,470,4.3522727272727275

2663874,4,B000IU37TS,"This is a LOT of Dane Cook to handle, which is not a bad thing at all, it's just more than we are used to seeing of him at one time.  So he tends to go off on subjects for a long time and usually with pretty funny results.  I've been a big fan of dane ever since I first saw him on comedy central back in the late 90's and his material has continued to impress me.  Of course it is constantly vulgar, constantly hilarious and pretty much what you can expect from a Dane HBO special.",1169078400,,482,3.8979591836734695
2663875,2,B000IU37TS,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Dane Cook's stand up in the past which is why I chose this DVD.  However, most of his jokes fell flat and weren't nearly as funny as his previous work.  I would not recommend this DVD.",1169078400,,210,4.225
2663876,3,B000IU37TS,"The most impressive part of this performance is the fact that it's in a (sold-out) coliseum that holds 18,000 people. Now that's an accomplishment for a rock band, much less a stand up comedian.

Unfortunately, I didn't feel that this particular routine warranted 18,000 people being there to witness it live. It has its moments of hilarity, but they aren't as prevalent as I would expect for a comedian with as many rabid young fans as Dane Cook has. Or maybe that's to be expected when most shots of the audience reveal screaming 17 year olds. I noticed the audience laughed a little less when he made higher brow jokes. Not to worry, though, he rarely makes those.

The main force of his comedy is that he's a likable guy. A likable guy with an apparently unending energy inside himself. He runs around the stage, yells, and pantomimes his way through the entire act.

The weirdest part about this act is that a lot of the longer bits that were supposed to be ""telling"" of human folly, etc. as comics often do, really seemed strangely off base and disconnected from the real world. I've seen him do much better.

Overall, I was disappointed in this entire routine and found myself liking Cook less and less as it progressed, even though there were definitely some laugh til it hurts moments.

The special featurette that shows Cook talking about his standup and preparing for this huge performance really shows the endearing side of Dane Cook the human, and shows how devoted to him his fans are. Not being one of those fans, I can't really relate, but you can definitely see the talent he has in delivery, unfortunately it only shows up every fourth joke.",1168819200,2,1659,4.648464163822526

2663888,1,B000IU37TS,"Isn't a comedian supposed be funny? Isn't he supposed to tell jokes or at least funny stories? Dane Cook walks around the stage and ponitificates to an adoring audience in Boston, but the show isn't funny, elightening or original. He's clearly doing old material that the audience is familiar with and they play along willingly. Watching this show for 90 minutes is like listening to a long winded friend who thinks he's so funny that you can't help but be enthralled by his stories. His physical antics don't add anything special to the performance.

Eddie Murphy's Delirious comes out on DVD in January. If you want to see how stand up comedy is supposed to be done, spend your money on that. It amazes me that someone this mediocre could have risen to this level of success, but there's no accounting for taste, I guess.",1166659200,14,823,4.675862068965517
2663889,2,B000IU37TS,"It wasn't that long ago that Dane Cook appeared to be the next best thing in stand up comedy.  However, you'd never know it by watching Vicious Circle, which finds the stand up comedian filling a huge arena of rousing fans.  Now I found most of Cook's earlier material much better than anything found in Vicious Circle, and many of those who loved his older material may be disappointed with what they get here, much like his HBO series Tourgasm.  Many of his jokes fall flat, though some of his material, including stories about theft, are very funny.  Other than that though, there isn't much here that we haven't seen or heard before, and heard better.  However, despite all the negative press I've just given it, it's crystal clear that Cook absolutely loves his fans, and that his fans absolutely love him.  Frequently Cook addresses and comes in contact with the fans populating the arena, and he is obviously having a blast doing what he does.  That itself is a welcome sight to see for a big time star (which Cook has become), so maybe there will be better things to come from Cook, hopefully.  All in all, if you're a fan of Dane Cook, chances are you'll probably disregard this review and check it out for yourself, but beware of what you're getting.",1165276800,17,1260,4.59375

And to my parents credit; they never once did that Zoolander-esque mug at the camera like he does after he finishes whatever abortion of Louis C.K's notebook that he's just finished.
