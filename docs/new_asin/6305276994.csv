NO HOGAN, NO UNDERTAKER, THE MACHO MAN WAS PUT IN A STUPID MATCH AGAINST CRUSH, NO ULTIMATE WARRIOR, DIESEL [KEVIN NASH] DIDN'T WRESTLE, A 10 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH GOT CANCELLED, AND MUCH OF THE EVENT WAS JUST BORING. HERE'S MY THOUGHTS ON THIS PPV'S CARD;

1. BRET HART VS. OWEN HART [R.I.P.]
THE BEST OPENING MATCH I'VE EVER SEEN. AND SUPRISINGLY, NONE OF THE OTHER MATCHES ON THIS EVENT EVER TOP THIS ONE. THIS EVEN TOPS THE CLASSIC LADDER MATCH BETWEEN RAZOR RAMON AND SHAWN MICHAELS THAT TOOK PLACE LATER THAT EVENING! AND A SHOCKING RESULT CAME OUT OF THIS MATCH. RATING; 5/5

2. BAM BAM BIGELOW & LUNA VACHON VS. DOINK & DINK
JUST A DUMB TAG TEAM MATCH THAT DOESN'T DESERVE A SPOT ON THIS EVENT. RATING; 1/5

3. RANDY SAVAGE VS. CRUSH
THEY SHOULD'VE GOTTEN A BETTER OPPONENT FOR SAVAGE. RATING; 2/5

4. FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP
CHAMPION ALUNDRA BLAZE [MADUSA] VS. LELANI KAI
UNINTERESTING WOMEN'S TITLE MATCH. RATING; 1/5

5. FOR THE WWE WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS
CHAMPIONS THE QUEBECERS [JACQUES & RAYMOND ROUGEAU] VS. MEN ON A MISSION [MABEL AKA VISCERA & MO]
PREDICTABLE AND STUPID. AND PLUS, IT'S A PRETTY POINTLESS MATCH. RATING; 1/5

6. 1ST MATCH FOR THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
CHAMPION YOKOZUNA [R.I.P.] VS. LEX LUGER SPECIAL REFEREE; THE LATE GREAT MR. PERFECT
A LACKLUSTER TITLE MATCH. THIS MATCH SHOULD'VE BEEN A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT IT WAS. RATING; 1.5/5

7. EARTHQUAKE VS. ADAM BOMB
BORING MATCH. RATING; 1/5

8. 1ST EVER LADDER MATCH FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP
CHAMPION RAZOR RAMON VS. SHAWN MICHAELS
A CLASSIC MATCH. AND THIS REALLY HELPED SAVE THIS WRESTLEMANIA FROM BEING THE WORST WRESTLEMANIA OF THEM ALL. FULL OF HIGH FLYING ACTION AND GOOD MOVES, THIS MATCH SHOULD SATISFY ANY WRESTLING FAN. RATING; 5/5

9. 2ND MATCH FOR THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
CHAMPION YOKOZUNA [R.I.P.] VS. BRET HART
AFTER LEX LUGER WAS DISQUALIFIED EARLIER IN THE EVENING IN YOKO'S 1ST TITLE DEFENSE, YOKO HAD TO PUT THE TITLE ON THE LINE FOR A 2ND TIME. HOWEVER, THIS TIME, THERE WAS ANOTHER SPECIAL REFEREE FOR THIS MATCH. THIS TIME, IT WAS RODDY PIPER. THIS MATCH WAS OK. AT LEAST BRET PICKS UP THE WIN IN THE END. RATING; 3.5/5

AND SO, THERE GOES A CRAPPY WRESTLEMANIA. THE SHOW WAS BAD. IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT IT HAD 2 REALLY REALLY GOOD MATCHES. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST WRESTLEMANIAS. THE ONLY ONES WORSE THAN THIS ONE ARE XI AND XIII.",1092268800,,2446,4.720657276995305

Perhaps the best technical match the WWE had ever put on at that stage. Bret/Owen was a great feud, and this was the best match they had. Truly breathtaking
5/5
Bam Bam Bigelow & Luna Vachon vs. Doink and Dink
This was just funny, not a good match, but funny. After Hart-Hart any match is going to suck, but this is here simply to help everybody recover for the previous bout.
3/5.
3. Macho Man vs. Crush
Entertaining stuff, and a decent match to finish a decent feud. Was this the first Falls Count Anywhere Match?

Pointless really, but better than the usualy diva matches

5. M.O.M. vs. the Quebeccers

8. Adam Bomb vs. Earthquake- wasn't really a match, but it was funny when Earthquake sat on Adam Bomb. (3/5)
9. Bret Hart vs. Yokozuna
Alot better than you think, and alot better than it was at Mania IX, and when you watch it a few times its an above average match, with the result everybody wanted.
4/5
I would personally have had Lex Luger vs Bret Hart in the final match and it could've done with an Undertaker match. But it was the best Mania up to this stage and after Wrestlemania XIX and X-Seven it is the best.",1072742400,,1384,4.368217054263566
1007558,5,6305276994,"In my opinion, this is probably the best Wrestlemania ever. I don't know why, but after seeing all the Wrestlemanias, I gotta say this is probably my fav. Plus, this was their first Wrestlemania without having to rely on Hulkamania to produce more buyrates. And it was done well. Anyways, here's my review of each match.
Matches (may not be in order, so shoot me):
1. Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart- one of, if not, the best technical wrestling match ever. Both men used a shxtload of moves that set the standard for other matches to come in the future. Just watch it, and you can tell it is a classic. This is also the match in my opinion, where Owen Hart juped out of the shadow of his brother. 5/5
2. Bam Bam Bigelow & Luna Vachon vs. Doink and Dink- funny as hell. It was funny when Dink was picking on that fat fxck Bam Bam, daring him to wrestle him. Not a great wrestling match, but it sure was entertaining. P.S. Bam Bam and Doink both suck equally 3/5.
3. Macho Man vs. Crush in a falls count anywhere match- again, not a good wrestling match, but sure was entertaining. 3/5
4. Alandra Blaze (a.k.a. Medusa) vs. Leilani Kai for women's title- I actually thought this was a good match, considering that WWF didn't give two shxts about the women's title. Pretty much a one-sided match, but it was cool. 2.5/5
5. M.O.M. vs. the Quebeccers for Tag Team titles- decent tag match. I loved it when the Quebeccers suplexed Mabel. Plus, The king had an awesome quote: ""Mabel was so big, he had to be baptized at Sea World."" Classic Lawler. 3/5
6. Lex Luger vs. Yokozuna for WWF championship- the only actual boring match. Never liked Lex, never liked Yoko. Sucky match. 2/5 just cause Mr. Perfect R.I.P. was the ref.
7. Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon for IC title in a ladder match- BEST MATCH ON HERE! While the ladder matches today maybe more violent and more spectacular, this is the best just because it was so new at the time. Both men took huge blows, whether it would be being hit with the Ladder, or falling off the ladder, it had to hurt. Probably the best ladder match, and one of the best Intercontinental matches ever. 10/5!!
8. Adam Bomb vs. Earthquake- wasn't really a match, but it was funny when Earthquake sat on Adam Bomb. 2.5/5
9. Bret Hart vs. Yokozuna- not a great match, but this gets a high rating just cause Bret is my fav. wrestler. 4.5/5",1067817600,,2356,4.393592677345538
1007559,5,6305276994,"WrestleMania X, some say the greatest WrestleMania of all time. Only WrestleMania XVII can be compared with the greatness of which this WrestleMania was. This was the first WrestleMania in which Hulk Hogan wasn't involved in, so the WWF was really wanting to prove that they did not need Hogan to put on a great show. Boy did they, as Bret and Owen opened up the show in the greatest match of all time. That match alone would have saved the show if all the other matches would of bombed. But the show didn't bomb out after that as Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels put on the WWF's first ever ladder match to an almost equally great performance. Many say the ladder match blew the roof off the garden and overshadowed Bret and Owen's match. But it didn't, Bret and Owen put on one of the greatest technical matches of all time that will be talked about in the same sentence as the Flair-Steamboat matches of 89. Though nothing else on the card was that great, there were some decent matches put on between Randy Savage-Crush, and MOM-Quebecers. None the less, this is definitely the greatest WrestleMania of all time and is a must have for anyone who claims to be a wrestling fan.

1007560,5,6305276994,"The tenth anniversary of the ""Wrestlemania"" phenomina featured a double main event where the World Title would be defended twice. Each match would have a special mystery guest referee. Lex Luger would face Yokozuna in the first and Bret Hart would get the winner.
This pay-per-view also featured the infamous ""brother vs. brother"" match as Bret faced Owen to open the show. We also got Crush taking on Macho Man in a falls-count-anywhere match and the classic Shawn Michaels-Razor Ramon ladder match that many including myself view as one of the best matches in Wrestlemania history. There were tons of special celebrity appearances and we also saw the returns of ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig and Roddy Piper as guest referees.

1007561,3,6305276994,"The event gets off to a great start with 'Brother vs. Brother' Owen and Bret Hart put on a wrestling clinic. Owen gets a clean hard fought victory and steps out from the shadow of Bret. I think this is the best WM opener match, save for WM X-8 with Mr. Monday Night, Mr. PPV, the Whole F'n Show, Rob Van Dam winning the IC strap from Regal. Speaking of the IC title, in one of the best IC title match at WM, 'Da Bad Guy' Razor Ramon beats 'HBK' Shawn Michaels in the first ladder match.'Big D' Diesel gets thrown out of the ringside area when he interferes behind the Ref's back. Ref sees Razor KO'D with Diesel standing over him taunting ,'now what do you soppose happend?' and 'Big D' and 'HBK' wondered why the ref did barred him from ringside. Bret got luckey in his final match with Yokozuna. As the huge Samoan/sumo star went for the leathal Banzai Drop the turnbuckle broke and Yoko fell off allowing Bret to pick-up the win. After the match a lot of WWF stars ran to the ring and hoisted Bret on their shoulders and congradulated him. Owen showed up but stayed outside the ring vowing to dethrone his older brother for the WWF title. The rules to the Falls count Anywhere were slightly odd: after a pinfall both combatants have 30 seconds to get in the ring if they both make it the match continues until one person is unable to reach the ring. I guess is gives both a chance at victory after the pinfall. Randy Savage hung Crush out to dry in the back room and made it back to the ring. Men On a Mission beat the Quebeckers by count out when Johnny Pollo AKA Raven helped the Quebecers to the back. Earthquake easily beat Adam Bomb AKA Wrath/ Brian Clarke. Alundra Blaze beat Leilani Kai. Lex Luger got the first wwf title shot of the night, but he got DQ'd by Specail ref Mr. Perfect. All-in-all an ok ppv.",1044835200,,1816,4.281976744186046

  This is called the first WWE ladder match. It is not. Back in '92/'93 somewhere in there, Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels in a ladder match was on cable Saturday night WWF. this one is the best ladder match ever.

Savage-Crush was gimmicky, but good.  Luger-Yokozuna was really really slow, and has gotten worse over the years and after several viewings.  Mr. Perfect as the referee was a subtle saving grace, RIP Curt.  What made this show great in 1994, and still does in 2003 are the two centrepiece matches the Ladder Match and the Curtain tugger of Bret Hart v. Owen Hart.  Both are still good after several viewings, but the ladder match has become dated.  It may have be historic in spawning similar gimmick matches, but a lot of the spots seem...less sick...in the 21st century.  Bret/Owen has retained the aura of a brother-brother rivalry, but still has lost something over time.  Wrestlemania X still stands as one of the best Wrestlemanias, but has been surpassed by Wrestlemania X-7 as the best Wrestlemania since Wrestlemania III.",1007596800,,995,4.904191616766467

I disagree: Wrestlemania 17 is better, but this is easily second best. There are really only two matches on the tape that are spectacular: the opener, Bret Hart v. Owen Hart. It's truly awesome. And, of course, as it's known in wrestling circles: The Ladder Match. Shawn Micheals and Razor Ramon put on a show that was CRAZY for the time and still holds up fine today. It wasn't as manic and fast paced as the TLC matches of today, but it was truly great. Other than those two matches, there's not a lot of memorable on this tape. I don't even remember all the matches. I do remember thinking Luger and Yoko was way too long. It would actually have been entertaining if it'd been five minutes (max) considering their repertoires. Doink's match was...well, a Doink match, although I have to agree with Vince and be very politically incorrect when I say that midgets are funny! Dink's amusing, at least. The woman's match was an actual MATCH as opposed to a skankfest like today, which is very cool. The main event could have used a finish, too, but otherwise, this is a great show.

Only 4 men supported the Federation by that time those were BRET HART, OWEN HART, SHAWN MICHAELS AND RAZOR RAMON.
Despite the terrible time period for the WWF at the time  Wrestlemania 10 proved to be the best since Wrestlemania 6.  It was funny too because the card did not look to promising but it turned out to be great.
The best matches were Bret Hart v.s. Owen Hart in a classic technical bro v.s. bro match,Shawn Michaels v.s. Razor Ramon in a great ladder match,and Crush v.s. Randy Savage in a classic falls count anywhere match.

The little brother trying to step out of the shadow of his big brother in Owen vs Bret in a wrestling clinic! The first ever televised WWE ladder match with Shawn Michaels against Razor Ramon was amazing as well. However this event was more than just a two match show. Randy Savage & Crush had a pretty good falls count anywhere and the match itself had an interesting twist where once you pin your opponent, he has 60 seconds to get back into the ring. Then there's the two title matches. There were two WWE title matches that night because of the finish of the Royal Rumble where both Bret Hart & Lex Luger both fell over the top rope at the same time and were both announced as winners. Yokozuna faced  Lex Luger in the first match. These two had IMO a great feud that sadly doesn't get talked about a lot. It started on July 4th of '93 when Luger slammed Yokozuna, that lead to their title match latter that year at Summer Slam. An underrated match on a very underrated PPV. This match as well was really good. Then the main event after Yokozuna defeated Luger, he went on to face Bret Hart in the main event. A great match that sent the fans home happy with Bret's victory and the great story telling at the end where Owen Hart comes and looks on as his big brother celebrities with the belt. Even on a night where the little brother beats the big brother, the big brother still upstages the little brother. 9/10 My 4th favorite WM behind only XIX, X7 & 3.",1491091200,,1531,4.315972222222222

7887335,4,6305276994,"The tenth anniversary of WrestleMania was a mixed bag.

Bret Hart VS Owen Hart: A perfect way to start off this event with Owen winning in the end with a roll-up.

Doink @ Dink VS Luna @ Bam Bam Bigelow: Ugh, what a crappy match and the ending was bad beyond belief.

Randy Savage VS Crush: I remember this feud quite well as McMahon is estatic to see Savage. I wonder what happened between this two anyways but I digress. Crush beats on Savage for the first few minutes but Savage throws salt back in Crush's face and here comes Savage! Mr Fuji dumps water on Crush's face to revive him. It was a very short match but enjoyable. Savage would be gone from WWF not long after this event and never seen in a WWF/WWE ring ever again.

Alundra Blayze vs Leilani Kai: Skip

Man I hated Vince's forced laughter when he did commentating.

Men on a Mission VS Quebecers: Quebecers looked good in this match and Mabel had moments of brilliance. The match ended out of nowhere with a count out.

Lex Luger VS Yokozuna with Mr Perfect as Guest ref: Mr. Perfect gets a big ovation for being the ref and got a bigger ovation then Luger. McMahon sells Luger hard and predicts he's going win and usher in the new generation. Luger hits an awesome cross body block from the top rope for a two count and hits a nice elbow but couldn't gain the win. The match then goes into a boring slow pace as Yoko had Luger in a nerve hold for almost five minutes, Yoko throws him to the outside, and locks him in the same nerve hold. Luger finally manages a comeback and hits a forearm but Cornette and Fuji come into the ring. Perfect doesnt make the count and tries to get Cornette up and then Fuji, Luger gets mad and hits Perfect. The match had some good moments in the opening minutes but fell flat due to very long nerve holds appiled by Yokozuna. The ending made no sense whatsoever and McMahon is confused. The crowd chants bulls@&*, probably a first for a WWF/WWE crowd.

Earthquake returns and quickly squashes Adam Bomb.

Shawn Michaels VS Razor Ramon in a Ladder Match: This match is an all time classic and one WrestleMania moment that is always shown. If you haven't watched it yet then your either new to wrestling or living under a rock.

A nice video package of Bret Hart is shown before the main event.

Yokozuna VS Bret Hart with speical guest ref Roddy Piper: Its funny how they are talking about Hart lost the opening match and it could effect him. I guess they forgot Yokozuna wrestled earlier, McMahon is not as enthused for Bret Hart as he was for Lex Luger. The match is pretty weak and not really main event worthy. Yoko attempts a bonsai drop but falls from the ropes and Hart covers him for the win. McMahon goes off after this win and says the new era is here, considering Yoko is farily new himself it didn't make much sense. If he beat Hogan i'd understand.

Overall, a mixed batch of matches. The Owen/Bret and Ladder matchs were show stealers and Macho Man/Crush and M.O.M/Quebecers were decent matches. The two best matches are on other sets so no need to watch this unless you got the anthology.",1258848000,,3101,4.392670157068062
7887336,3,6305276994,"Wrestlemania X was pretty much average at best believe it or not. Not a lot of the matches were delivering. The Harts and the Ladder match were indeed classics but the other matches wasn't really all that whatsoever.

1. Bret ""Hit-man"" Hart vs. Owen Hart
Now if you want a perfect demostration on what a 5 star match is really like, then this match shows you. You couldn't ask for anything more from this one. The Hart brothers are defiantly talented and they show you what true wrestling is here. Owen was a heel during this time so you expected some dirty tactics from him. Bret was awesome as always. A lot of mat wrestling and some good counters and reversals. Perfect match. Match of the night. 5/5*****

2. Doink & Dink vs. Bam Bam Bigelow & Luna
This match was totally for the entertainment value alone. Bam Bam and Doink tryed to make it a match. Not very amusing to me. 2/5

3. Falls Count Anywhere Match
""Macho Man"" Randy Savage vs. Crush w/ Mr. Fugi
Now the rules of this match aint the standard rules of your regular falls count anywhere match now days. You would have to score a pin fall first anywhere out of the ring and then the opponent would have 60 seconds to get back to the ring before he would be declared the loser. Both men took a little bit of punishment but I think it would have been better just as a regular one on one match. Fugi interferes of course. Something was just missing for me. I don't know what it was but this match just didn't do it for me. A little disappointed in this one. 2.5/5

4. WWE Women's Title
Alundra Blaze vs. Leilani Kai
This women's match also didn't do it for me either. It had a few nice moves and a counter here and there but not anything worth mentioning. 2/5

5. WWE Tag Team Titles
The Quebecers w/ Johnny Polo vs. Man on a Mission
This match was fairly decent at best. Mabel pulled off a nice splash on the floor to one of the quebecers. The quebecers also pulled of an impressive double suplex on mabel. The fact is though, you just couldn't really ask for anything more from 2 guys weighing over 400 lbs. and a B tag team. The dq was a saving grace though. 3/5

6. WWE Championship w/ Mr. Perfect as the Special Referee
Yokozuna w/ Mr. Fugi & Jim Cornette vs. Lex Luger
I don't really have anything worth noting on this one either. It wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't great. It did have a pretty cheap ending with Perfect dqing Luger. Decent match but could have been better. 2.5/5

7. Adam Bomb w/ Harvey Whippleman vs. Earthquake
Now I don't know if this match was on the card or not but it was defiantly a 5 minute segment waste of time. Pourly way to set up for the ladder match. 0/5

8. Ladder Match for the Undisputed Intercontinental Title
Shawn Michaels w/ Diesel vs. Razor Ramon
This is the second classic match on this card worth seeing. These two had a pretty good match before the ladder got introduced. Diesel would soon get ejected after clotheslining Razor. Both men without a doubt took some hard bumps. Michaels utilized some interesting moves with the ladder. Razor got a couple of good shots in too. They brawled a few times while on the ladder. Great match if you haven't seen it already. 4.5/5

9. WWE Championship w/ Roddy Piper as the Special Referee
Yokozuna w/ Jim Cornette & Mr. Fugi vs. Bret Hart
I do have to say I felt this was much better than their match from Wrestlemania 9. Yoko really dominates the majority of the match. Hart was able to pull off some counters here and there but he also took some hard shots as well from Yoko. It seemed that the Hitman was still feeling the effects from his first match with Owen. Piper kept it interesting too. Hart was also to pull off some moves once he got the advantage. The ending felt a kind of cheap when Yoko ""lost"" his balance from the second rope. Hart defiantly deserved this one. 3/5

Wrestlemania X is worth a rental at the most only to see the Harts match and the ladder match with the rest of the card aint giving much. Don't invest too much in this one. I would rather and get the anthology set instead of buying this alone if I was yall.",1218931200,2,4091,4.315104166666667
7887337,5,6305276994,"This is often referred to as the greatest Wrestlemania of all time. It definitely has to be in the top 3. From the awesome opener with Bret and Owen Hart facing off in the middle of Madison Sqaure Garden, to the cool ending of the Hitman proudly taking the WWF Championship from Yokozuna, this event packs a sure-fire WWF punch. The Bret/Yoko match is a sort of rematch to their Wrestlemania encounter from the year before. In that match, Yoko takes the title from Bret. But the Canadian legend makes up for it in this March 1994 Garden classic. Yoko defends the title twice in one night thanks to the previous January's Royal Rumble controversy in which both Bret and Lex Luger toppled over the top rope at the same time, being declared co-winners by onscreen WWF President Jack Tunney. Yoko defends the title first against Lex Luger, with Hall Of Famer Mr. Perfect Curt Henning as the special guest ref. Bret gets his shot against Yoko with Roddy Piper as the ref. This Mania also features the first pay-per-view WWF Ladder Match between ""The Bad Guy"" Razor Ramon and ""The Heartbreak Kid"" Shawn Michaels, competing for the undisputed WWF Intercontinental Championship. The WWF also uses an imposter dressed as President Bill Clinton, something they would duplicate at Survivor Series 1995 the next year. It's a pretty funny little angle. All in all, a great Wrestlemania that you need to help make your collection complete.",1183420800,,1425,4.820408163265306
7887338,5,6305276994,"Three matches carried this event to five stars.  Bret/Owen and Shawn/Razor for sheer AWESOMENESS, and Yoko/Bret for historic value and satisfaction.  On top of that, the crowd is hot and the pay per view is packed with drama, excitement, and the *big* feeling that the tenth ever Mania should have.

Owen vs. Bret - AMAZING technical match that goes back and forth with incredible psychology.  There isn't a single rest hold that doesn't have some logic or psychology to it. *****

Doink and Dink vs. Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon - who the HELL booked this crap?  Amusing filler, I suppose.  Bigelow was one of the hardest-working big men of all time and the WWF trashed him with crap like this.  What a shame. *

Falls Count Anywhere: Randy Savage vs. Crush - The stipulation here was that after a pinfall, the ref would begin a count to 60.  If the pinned man could not make it back to the ring after 60, the match was over.  This was Savage's last hurrah in the WWF.  Okay enough match, with Savage rightfully getting a victory. **1/4

WWF Women's Title: Leilani Kai vs. Alundra Blayze - I couldn't care less about the women's division, but I always liked Alundra Blayze.  She had style.  Leilani Kai is old and brings down a decent women's wrestler. *

Quebecers vs. Men on a Mission - The Quebecers were really solid workers at this time, but they were put against the abysmal Mabel.  They carried this to a decent rating. **3/4

WWF Title Match #1: Yokozuna vs. Lex Luger - TERRIBLE match with a screwjob ending.  Yoko holds a vulcan nerve hold to the trapezius of DOOM for about 10-12 solid minutes, with one slight break in the middle of actual wrestling.  The ending does provide some really good heat, however, but after this match you're thinking a good PPV has turned horribly mediocre. 1/2*, just for the Lex screwjob

Adam Bomb vs. Earthquake - Nice little filler/DUD slipped in there to eat up a minute.  Another chapter in the Harvey Whippleman/Howard Finkleman feud. (snicker)

Ladder match for the IC title: Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - IN-FREAKING-CREDIBLE!  Just when you thought Owen-Bret was match of the night, these two put on a match unlike anything ever seen in a WWF ring.  It's slower than the modern ladder match, so complete idiots who are programmed to salivate over modern matches like Pavlov dogs will say this is subpar.  Those people are idiots.  There's some PSYCHOLOGY to the slow spots, morons.  Two men getting beaten with ladders are SUPPOSED to move slowly after 15-20 minutes of fighting.  But I digress.  This has some truly great spots and is worth seeing for every reason you would want to see a match. *****

WWF Title match #2: Bret Hart vs. Yokozuna - Mercifully short match with not too much stalling and good psychology by Bret with the selling of his knee injury.  The match is a solid *1/2-**, but the historic value of ""David"" beating ""Goliath"" makes this match worth about a **** or more.  That's right - Bret upsets Yoko to avenge the terrible outcome of the previous year's 'Mania and go on to become one of the greatest WWF Champions of all time. (THE greatest, IMHO)

Overall, awesome show.  Razor and Shawn get over for their incredible match, and Bret and Owen get over for monumental victories.  It gave four of the WWF's most talented workers at the time some palpable prestige, and the wrestling ain't half bad either.  Terrific 'Mania.",1163376000,,3406,4.663865546218488
7887339,4,6305276994,"This event truley was a classic.  First with Owen vs Bret!  Wow the best technical wrestling since Flair vs. Savage 92""!  The ladder match was awsome too. Yoko was in the best condition of his carreer at 560 lbs.  Luger vs Yoko - 7/10  Bret vs Yoko 9/10

Ladder Ramon vs Hbk-10/10 and so was Hart vs Hart.  I wish undertaker was a part of this classic.  I would of let him beat YOKo in the Main Event and have Luger vs Hart for the # 1 contendership! The Tag title match and the Mixed tag were both a waste of my time.  Savage vs Crush was different but good and entertaining.

Overall a 90% or 9/10- great effort and really showed WCW that WWE was dominate",1148601600,,657,4.102362204724409
7887340,5,6305276994,"1. Owen Hart vs. Bret Hart-- This match was the best opening match in wrestlemania history.. Excellent plotted match from start to finisher.. By the way Owen played the heel role well in this match and based on my 5 point scale for all my reviews.. You guessed it.. It gets a 5.. And on side note.. I am GLAD Owen was able to beat Bret and step out of his shadow.. GO OWEN!

2. Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna vs. Doink The Clown and Dink The Clown-- Match wise it wasn't much of anything.. But Dink is funny as hell.. LMAO.. He made Bam Bam and Luna look so stupid.. LMAO.. I give this match a 2.

3. Macho Man vs. Crush Falls Count Anywhere-- I must note that the match was totally messed up based on that 1 minute outside rule.. I will not put why here but all you wrestling professors know why.. I don't want to detract from the match so I will end this pretty good match with a 2 1/4 stars

4. Leilani Kai vs. Alundra Blayze Womens Title-- I liked this match.. I don't know why but I did.. Alundra is a very athletic womens champ for this era.. I give this match 2 stars.

5. MOM vs. Jacques and Pierre Rougeau- I actually liked this match as well.. MOM looked good in this match to be honest I think.. I give it 2 stars as well

6. Yokozuna vs. Lex Luger WWF Title- I didn't like this match at all.. On side note I heard something about Luger supposed to win but gave the results to some media guy while drunk so WWE gave it to Zuna.. The rumor was Luger would win to lose it to Bret who he did the tie thing with at Rumble.. So overall with the Perfect junk.. I give this match 1 1/8 stars.. Not saying much about this long dreading match..

7. Adam Bomb vs. Earthquake-- I don't care squash or not. But could some other talent be put here..? - 0 stars.. And yes I know its no such score but 0 is too good for this..

8. Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon Ladder Match-- This match was excellent.. Everyone knows this but I didn't like the finish.. I just didnt.. It took too long for Razor to get up and Shawn got out too early so he hooked his hand up.. Besides that I do not want to detract from the grading.. It still gets 5 stars because what I just mentioned is not noticeable unless you look for it..

9. Yokozuna vs. Bret Hart- Me too, like everyone was surprised.. But GLAD.. Bret won.. I liked this match.. 3 stars.. I loved with the WWE locker room filled for Bret in congrats.. And I must note here.. When Macho Man filled the ring after Brets win.. It was his last time entering a WWE Wrestlemania ring.. So this is a VERY historic WM.. One of my top 5.. I also liked how Owen came out at end to play the heel..

OVERALL- I recommend this WM to everyone that likes wrestling and WRESTLEMANIA! MUST HAVE Wrestlemania for all viewers!!",1130025600,,2742,4.0912476722532585
