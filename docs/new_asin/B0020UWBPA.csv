This was done in the heyday of the History Channel, when they did more true research and science, and less junk as one sees today.  It was especially nice to see the author Michael Neufeld being interviewed (""The Rocket and the Reich"", ""Von Braun"").",1427241600,,408,4.486486486486487
8348677,4,B0020UWBPA,"This is a 4 part documentary that aired on the History channel around 1997. The episodes are:

First Steps to the Stars
The Vengeance Weapons
Missiles of the Cold War
Man in Space

The program does a very good job covering the history of rockets from the early days up through the space program. The second episode gives particularly comprehensive coverage to the German V2 program of WWII - it's development, the facilities, the capture, and transfer to the US of German war materials. Some fairly unusual footage can be found in this section.

There are classroom study guides for two of the episodes on the History Channel web site:

This program would be enjoyable for anyone interested in space technology or the relationship between development of rockets and missiles for military purposes and the US and Russian space programs.",1266710400,,841,4.9361702127659575
