But this second version with Matt Damon it was full of action all the way and the ways he manage to get away with what he was planning during the movie.

Now the 2nd. part of The Bourne Identity - which is called The Bourne Supremacy, even though it was full of action, the mistery of the frame of the killing in Berlin was the race of his life.

I waited much to go to see this movie but I left dissapointed. Maybe I didn't give the time to understand it. Maybe!! But still I was dissapointed.",1123718400,,764,4.148648648648648
2234964,2,B0007R4TSK,"I received my Bourne Supremacy/Bourne Identity value pack a few days ago.  Went ahead and watched identity, wonderful movie.  Then I went to open the supremacy and was shocked to find it was FULL SCREEN.  The product details of the value pack says WIDE SCREEN.  The Bourne Identity is wide screen which is what I wanted.  I know there are a lot of people out there including me who won't watch anything but widescreen.  The fact that they have the two mixed boggles my mind.  Some like FULL some like WIDE, this mix isn't good for anyone.  I just contacted Amazon and am waiting on their reply.  I know Amazon normally has great customer service so I'm expecting they'll pay for me to ship the full screen version back and send me the wide screen version of supremacy.  I'll change this post and my rating as soon as I find out what they plan  on doing.  So beware to anyone purchasing this item.

Amazon sent me new copies of the movie I just received today!  They also paid for me to ship back the wrong copy.  They took care of this problem immediately and didn't give me any trouble.  Truly excellent customer service.",1123027200,25,1122,4.45320197044335
2234965,4,B0007R4TSK,"These movies are both solid movies that are finally available together for a great bargain. While I do prefer the original because the fight scenes in the 2nd one were blurry at times and hard to see what was going on, they are both solid movies.

The first is about the mystery of Jason Bourne, a man who was once a contract killer who is confused who he is. The movie packs lots of action, suspense and a whopper of an ending. (That was quite unrealistic but was still cool)

The sequel is about Jason Bourne who is trying to live a normal relaxing life until he's framed for murder. And, now he's go to settle the score and set things right.

They're both good movies and for the price, it's worth it to see the action and suspense.",1119830400,2,735,4.273381294964029

8050711,5,B0007R4TSK,"The Bourne series is great action adventure. Such a complicated character. The books are wonderfully detailed.  So much more than the movies, but the movies are wonderful too. Adding the Bourne series to your library, both video and book is a great investment.",1251763200,,260,5.046511627906977

Thanks, Matt!",1224288000,,220,3.911111111111111
8050713,5,B0007R4TSK,"As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.

The two Bourne movies, namely The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.

Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.

In the first move, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Profesosr') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.

In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.

In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.

For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...

His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.

For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great!

Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.

Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.

To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally.",1153440000,,4114,4.913544668587896
8050714,4,B0007R4TSK,"Mindless action entertainment - and good.  Fantastic martial arts and car chase scenes, clever plotting, and excellent acting by the ensemble casts in both films

make them highly entertaining.  When you need a little adrenalin boost, these films can be just the thing.",1138665600,3,269,5.209302325581396
8050715,3,B0007R4TSK,"Robert Ludlum may have passed on, but his work is definitely alive in the cinema. His taut Jason Bourne series has been adapted into two movies (so far), ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" which are action-packed and tautly directed but also brimming with flaws.

""The Bourne Identity"" opens with an amnesiac (Matt Damon) being hauled onto a fishing boat, with two bullets in his back. Once he's recovered, he goes in search of his identity -- and finds links to a sinister organization that is out to kill him. And as he goes on the run, Jason Bourne must uncover who he is and why he is a fighting machine.

""The Bourne Supremacy"" opens with Bourne tormented by nightmares, even though he's living peacefully in India. But then his enemies are after him again, and even destroy his beloved girlfriend. Now Bourne is out for revenge against the people who won't leave him in peace -- assuming that they don't kill him first.

What can an action movie do that hasn't been done before? That's a hard question to answer, and most efforts (any ""XXX"" movie, for example) fall horribly flat. Bang bang, blast blast, add a few naked bodies, and that is all they do for innovation.

But these two movies at least attempt to find something unique. And they succeed to some degree: ""Bourne Identity"" has a stripped-down appeal, complete with down-the-stairs car chases and stark European cities, and although the story seems to meander at times, it isn't peppered with stale witticisms and hokey gadgets.

Unfortunately, the second movie was done by a different director -- a far less talented one, alas. And so the cinematography is downright atrocious, with half the scenes done in a shakycam style that bobs all over the place. Even on a small screen, it's enough to make you seasick. At least it distracts from the stumbling if tense plot.

Matt Damon obviously threw his all into these films. His acting is made intriguing by its intensity, which keeps him from seeming like yet another James Bond clone, albeit one with amnesia. He's really trying, it seems. Much of the film's tension comes from Damon, and he also provides it with some surprisingly realistic-looking fights.

And ""Supremacy"" is graced with two excellent performances, in the icy, taut Joan Allen and the sinister Karl Urban. Bourne's love interests aren't quite as good: Julia Stiles doesn't have enough screen time to make us like her character, and Franka Potente plays a dizzy, inglorious Bond girl who's just there for Damon to bed.

Though ""Bourne Supremacy"" is a dizzying shakycam trip, the films together are a taut action duology, yet they lack equally taut storylines. Matt Damon's intense performance is what keeps it from being mediocre.",1132704000,2,2729,4.879049676025918

8050717,5,B0007R4TSK,"I am very much a fan of this genre' of story (film, book whatever). I think that the ""spy thriller"" is the most entertaining amusement. I grew up in the early cold war era and much of this was in the news from time to time. The Bourne series has been a DELIGHT , I really like the casting,the direction and the acting. Sometimes it is a little predictable but not so much as to distract. If you like this stuff be careful the rest of the genre' will seem pedestrian for a while after this.",1125360000,5,489,4.104166666666667
8050718,5,B0007R4TSK,"This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen:  not only does it avoid degenerating into a formula - with one of the principal characters killed off at the beginning - but it adds to the characters of all the players.  Bourne is still evolving in Damon's hands, becoming a new person from the confused automaton that he was in the first film, someone you can believe in and allow to enter your imagination.  Of course, there are great action scenes, filmed in a you-are-there jiggle, that reach new heights of realism.  (Interestingly, the director refused to use any computer animation, as he knew the audience would recognise it as such.)

But it is Damon who truly impresses:  he adds creative twists to his characters like only a truly great actor can, carrying an entire environment with him, a consciousness that the viewer can envision and empathise with.  I would say he is this generation's Gene Hackman, a star who rises not on simple sex appeal but on outstanding acting talent.  I will watch any film he is in.

Warmly recommended.  Let's hope they stop here, while the quality is maintained.",1124755200,6,1107,4.689119170984456
