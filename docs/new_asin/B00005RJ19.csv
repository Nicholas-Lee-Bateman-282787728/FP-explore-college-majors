I would like to try the arms and chest one but can't find it. The legs and buns is straight forward and high reps but really effective.  I use that  when I do not want to lift to heavy weights.  But I will not be using this. I do Cathe Freidrich mostly and I love how she caters to advanced.  But some days I want a tuff cardio but not as hard as hers maybe take it down a notch but sweat anyway! This is not the one.",1484870400,,505,3.682242990654206
