5721857,4,B00CG0YM24,"This was an overall good movie, i thought it was going to be more like The Man from Nowhere, i like the story though. Good action and martial arts, though i expected more martial arts, overall good Korean film, and a good ending.",1384819200,2,229,4.348837209302325
5721858,5,B00CG0YM24,"I thought this movie was just brilliant. Well packed action leaves you wanting more. I loved it, 5 stars all the way! This movie does not fail to impress.",1382313600,3,154,4.344827586206897
5721859,5,B00CG0YM24,"I didn't know what to expect going in to watch this movie. I was not familiar with the main character. Man, was this like a slap to the face or something! the main guy, So Ji-Seob is a truly phenomenal actor. The intensity he portrays on screen is so heart wrenching. The film definitely starts slow, but that slow burn grows into something epic by the end. You get pulled into his goal and by the end you are cheering him on. This film totally made me his fan.

I recommend this to anyone that appreciates a good drama, there are some action scenes but they are not the focal point. (although, that scene in the car was so freaking awesome!)",1380844800,4,642,4.305785123966942
5721860,2,B00CG0YM24,I was really looking forward to watching this movie.  Epic fail for me.  Really didn't make much sense and the plot was awful.,1380672000,,126,4.434782608695652
5721861,5,B00CG0YM24,"Great movie. Nicely paced, good story and likeable (and dislikeable) characters. The action scenes were pretty awesome - love the Tarantino-esque all out office scene at the end. U.S. folks may have mixed feelings about it but I think the entire concept of the movie is to take the stereotype of the salaried man to a new sarcastic, witty and over-the-top level so if you watch it with that view I think you'd enjoy it more. Not to say it's not enjoyable as is.  Overall, definitely worth getting and watching.  I'm also becoming a big fan of the lead actor So Ji-Sub. He seems to make some solid movie choices. I just watched him in Rough Cut (directed by Kim Ki Duk - who did Spring, Summer, Autumn, Fall... and Spring, Pieta, Samaritan Girl, 3-Iron, to name just a few of the classics), the Korean title is actually read ""A Movie is a Movie"" and the Korean title makes the movie make more sense when you watch it. Anyway, just saw him in that and that was pretty awesome. And saw him in Always (""Only You"") and that was great too so 3 for 3 for me with this actor. Look forward to more movies with him.",1379894400,15,1105,4.333333333333333
5721862,5,B00CG0YM24,"Watched it ones, loved it, watched it the second time the day after. Sub's acting was great as always. There weren't too many action sequences, but the ones they had were very well done!",1379635200,,186,4.5
5721863,4,B00CG0YM24,"Instead of the revenge narrative which has seemed most common in Korean crime films in the past decade or so, A Company Man takes another approach with this thriller about a professional hit man. This doesn't necessarily ensure that the storyline is original, often resembling numerous other box office hits. With a silently morally superior protagonist, A Company Man often resembles The Man From Nowhere in style and tone.

  The boldest choices that A Company Man makes in its narrative occur within the first ten minutes, when we are exposed to the cold-hearted ruthlessness our protagonist Hyeong-do (SO Ji-sub) is capable of. Unfortunately, the remainder of the film shows the redeeming choices that this character makes, hardly appearing to be the same man. Unable to continue the lifestyle of working as a hired killer, Hyeong-do attempts to plan a way out of his employment with the ruthless corporation dealing in death.

  The storyline advances toward familiar territory as our antihero becomes a hero, not only longing to get out of the business but also providing help for the family members of victims. His kind nature is what is meant to draw the audience into caring about him as the corporations assassins are also drawn in to eliminate him and provide some of the films most visceral thrills.

I won't  write u the scrip of the story, I just say this go watch it then u judged ;)",1377993600,,269,3.8727272727272726
5721865,4,B00CG0YM24,"On the surface Ji Hyeong-Do (Ji-seob So) looks like any other ordinary businessman commuting in a train. Every morning he goes to the office of a medium-sized ""metal trading"" enterprise in Seoul. But what people in the same building do not know is that Ji Hyeong-Do has been working for the company that in fact specializes in contract killings. He is a faithful ""company man"" who gets paid and even ""promoted"" for what he does. He is even tasked with ""firing"" his co-workers.

One day Ji Hyeong-Do's perfect life as first-rate killer starts to change, however, when he chooses not to follow a certain part of the order given to him. This leads to his meeting with Yu Mi-yeon (Mi-yeon Lee), mother of two children. And Yu Mi-yeon was a singer Ji Hyeong-Do adored when he was young.

A 2012 Korean thriller ""A Company Man"" is more about the central character Ji Hyeong-Do and his transformation than about the brutal fights he has to go through. The action is sparse, especially in the first half of the film, but once it begins, it gets pretty tense with bloody and violent combat scenes.

Perhaps writer and director Sang-yoon Lim (his feature debut) could have developed the relationship between the salaried killer and the retired singer. Some of the subplots are also underdeveloped, with a police detective whose role the film could have used more effectively. With the superb acting from the cast and intense climax, however, ""A Company Man"" is worth checking out.",1370822400,24,1470,4.825396825396825

5721877,4,B00CG0YM24,"If you can get beyond the usual American aversion to subtitling, this is a surprisingly engrossing 2012 Korean thriller. An apparently mundane metals company conceals a league of professional contract assassins. No one could look more ""normal"" or nonthreatening than these polite, suit-and-tie ""businessmen."" However, death is all in a day's work. Conflict arises when the young protagonist, Hyong-do, wishes to leave a profession for which there is no real ""retirement."" As a longtime fan of good martial arts and action thrillers, I found the scenes of violence startling and impressive, not overdone, and never performed at the cost of the story, or the also-impressive acting by all concerned. I could have wished for a LITTLE more character development (in the pursuing cop, for example)  but overall this is a memorable film, which I'll keep in my collection.",1449187200,,865,5.268115942028985
5721878,5,B00CG0YM24,"The whole story is good.  The drama and inner strength of this guy is great. Casting for good and evil is well done.

5721881,4,B00CG0YM24,"Although this movie does not have a particularly original storyline I still enjoyed it. As with many foreign films it does not have your standard Western 'happy ending' and I am fine with that. It reminded me somewhat of a cross between ""The Man From Nowhere"" and ""Hindsight"" which I also have watched more than once. (Although after awhile this kind of ending becomes a cliche also.) I was pleased with the choreography of the fight scenes. The shootout in the office however was so ridiculous that it became a parody of itself. That was a major shortcoming to me. The woman in the basement was briefly shown to just be an Office Lady trying to get by. With it's 'flaws' I still recommend it.",1432944000,,693,4.552

5721908,5,B00CG0YM24,"""A Company Man"", while perhaps not as exciting or engrossing as ""The Man From Nowhere"", is nonetheless an excellent character study and a truly tragic depiction of the kind of people we become when our work becomes our whole life.
Forgive me but I am no good at writing Korean names by memory so I will not be using them here.  Our main character is essentially one of an office full of Seoul yuppies.  Young, elite, professional, and dedicated - but he, his superiors, and subordinates all have one huge secret: their button down world of memos and cubicles is all a cover for the fact that they are an office of trained assassins.  Yes, you read that right.  Even the nerdiest of young employees at this company knows how to kill quickly and quietly.  Knives, fiber wire, suppressed pistols, and SMGs are dispensed like office supplies.  Our protagonist is the best of the lot, and he is soon to be promoted, but lately he has been questioning his choices in life.  Simply put: he has gone soft.  Unfortunately for our hero you are not fired when you lose your edge at this company, you are eliminated.
His decision to quit the company jeopardizes everything and nearly cost him everything as well.  I cannot safely go into more detail without spoiling surprises, sorry.  But I will say that the best part of this movie is the metaphor it presents.  Anyone who has been good at a job they dislike can relate to the conundrum our hero finds himself in.  Anyone who has made their work more important than their personal life will see themselves reflected in the characters.",1391644800,,1574,4.622302158273381
5721909,4,B00CG0YM24,"I was a decent show; I enjoyed that.

Probably what I enjoyed most was seeing Korea as the backdrop for it; assuming that is where it was all shot.  It looked like Korea anyway.

As far as the movie was concerned, it mixed a little ""fantastical"" with the ""realistic life"" story - enough to make it exciting and not too hokey.",1390780800,,325,4.295081967213115
5721910,3,B00CG0YM24,This movie was kind of a weak but So Ji-sub made the movie at least some what entertaining.  Not sure why this movie didn't meet my expectations.  I think maybe the story latched back story.  I really liked So Ji-sub in the master's Sun.,1389916800,,237,4.340909090909091
