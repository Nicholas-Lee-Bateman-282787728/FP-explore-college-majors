7490517,3,B017757OCW,Good action and fight scenes but an average story line. Overall it was an ok movie to watch but certainly not as good as under the red hood or assault on arkham,1453161600,,160,4.03125
7490518,5,B017757OCW,"This new DC Animation shows off the Batman family and mythos never before seen in Batman: Bad Blood. Granted, when I first heard about this new animation I was skeptical. Bringing in Bat Woman and Bat Wing and then removing Batman? I honestly didn't think this could have went well, yet I was more than pleasantly surprised when I sat down and actually watched it. This movie was able to fit in 2 origin stories, a fun and interesting plot, and keep all the characters at bay, without overloading one or the other. The plot kept me enthralled in the experience and had shocking twists and turns that I would have never expected. The action, as always, was amazing and well done. The ""c"" list villains that were featured came off as genuinely threatening instead of jokes and fit in well with the story. Jason O'Mara, Stuart Allen, and Sean Maher continue to keep up amazing portrayals of beloved characters, Jason in particular due to him being somewhat in the shadow of the great Kevin Conroy. Overall, no complaints from me. As a comic fan, I could have picked this apart due to the occasional inaccuracies that wouldn't have or have happened differently in print, but I understand that this is a completely different universe that not only gives clever odes to the canon, but also maintains itself as an original concept. This may perhaps be the best DC animation of this line of stories (Justice League War, Throne of Atlantis, Son of Batman, Batman v.s. Robin, etc) I look forward to the next movie and I hope DC keeps up the good work into the DCCU.",1453161600,,1555,4.617328519855596
7490519,3,B017757OCW,"It was just ok.  I love Dick Grason and Damian's continued conflict but the rest of the family fell short for me.  Its a bit to in your face about the lesbian themes too but that's the way DC comics are going so it doesn't stray too much from the comics right now.  They must show you how progressive they are so they can check that box off with their buddies at work and get their pat on their backs.
 I did like the addition of Batwing.  He needs a bit more development and I hope they give him time to develop in the movies like they have in the books.  Not the best Batman movie but not the worst.",1453161600,4,601,3.966666666666667

It's also a good intro to the newer story lines of the characters as they have evolved, though we all miss Oracle.",1506384000,,476,4.230769230769231

7490539,5,B017757OCW,"This movie continues the story from the ""Son of Batman"" and ""Batman vs. Robin"" movies, but I wouldn't say it's absolutely necessary to watch those before this one. There was literally only one line (Robin references a previous battle) that called back to them specifically, everything else (Talia and Bruce being Damian's parents, Dick being Batman's former partner, etc) is pretty standard comic book knowledge and also mentioned within the dialogue for good measure.

The movie starts with newcomer Batwoman confronting some villains at a warehouse. The fight gets out of hand, and Batman shows up to help her out. He saves her life (tossing her out of the building) before the whole thing explodes. 2 weeks later, he hasn't been seen since, and Batwoman (real name Kate Kane) is trying to track him down. Meanwhile Damian/Robin decides to return to Gotham to find his missing father, and a worried Alfred calls Dick/Nightwing home from Bludhaven to help in Bruce's absence. Nightwing dons the Batman costume and he and Robin team up with Batwoman (and later Lucius Fox's son Luke/Batwing) to find Bruce and stop Talia Al Ghul and her plot for mind-controlling the world leaders by hacking into Wayne technology.

I'm really only a Batman fan BECAUSE of the extended Batman family characters. Nightwing, Batgirl, and Robin (not really so much the Damian variety, but I'll take what I can get) are some of my favorite comic book characters, and I love to see them getting bigger roles in the movies. I also enjoyed getting to know Batwoman. She didn't really strike me as that interesting at first, but there are a few scenes where you see her as a person outside of the mask, and while we don't learn a whole lot, it made me appreciate and like her character more. Similarly Batwing gets even less backstory, but he makes a cool addition to the team, even if he ends up destroying more buildings with his technology-driven suit than he does save the day. (Although he does a little of that, too.) Batgirl/Barbara Gordon isn't really in the movie, but she has a cameo at the end when the whole Bat Family is heading out to respond to the Bat Signal, which made me pretty happy. Hopefully she'll be showing up again in a future movie! (One that isn't ""The Killing Joke,"" that is.)

I think my favorite of the DC animated movies is still ""Batman: Under the Red Hood,"" but this is probably my second favorite. It was fun, never felt boring, and was refreshing to see the ""family"" featured in the spotlight a bit. There's little hints about Dick being in the Teen Titans (he's talking to Starfire on the phone in one scene, and mentions going back to ""the tower"") and since there are two ""Teen Titans"" movies that have come since this one was released, that makes sense.

There's some typical PG-13 violence with blood, Batwoman is a lesbian and talks about dating with another woman at a bar, but there was nothing I thought was too shocking or out-of-place in these films. I don't remember any strong language, but there was probably a curse word here or there. I wouldn't say this is a kids' movie, but if your kids are cool with the live-action PG-13 superhero movies I don't think there's anything worse in this film.

All-in-all, I'd definitely recommend it to Batman and Batman family fans, particular if you like Nightwing/Dick, Robin/Damian, or Batwoman/Kate.",1501718400,,3365,4.765008576329331

I read a review that opined that the Batwing & Batwoman characters were unnecessary.  But in a ""Batman"" movie, aren't *all* other characters usually unnecessary?  That said, the main theme of the movie is ""family"", and put in that context all of the characters make sense.  I would have liked if they had extended the movie another 10 minutes to give these characters a little more fleshing out.  That said, the movie did a good job giving you the core of who these characters are and how they fit in the Bat universe.  With all the time spent on the Bat Family, not much time was left for the bad guys.  You didn't get much background on the villains for why they were doing what they were doing.  There were two key scenes, and the second (at the end) wasn't that believable given what all had taken place so far.  But in all, I'd recommend the movie.  There are three graphic deaths (two involving head shots), so it earns its PG-13 rating.",1483315200,3,1117,4.448275862068965

7490588,5,B017757OCW,"Way better than previous Batman movies, it's some of the best I seen for a stand alone Batman animated film. OK, this is an animated film but it's only like roughly 72 minutes. So it feels flawed or thin in some areas of the film such as Batwoman's origins. Damien is more caring in this one but he still has a rough persona. Dick is good as NightWing. He will never be the Batman but he can hold his own in his own right. Alfred can still kick some butt! And I like that the focal point in this film is not just about Bruce/Batman. Batman disappears and every Bat vigilante starts looking for him ie Nightwing or Batwoman. Like the humor and quirkiness in it. And let's not forget the NUNjas! LOL The voice acting was good. I liked Kevin Conroy over the years but I think he had his time. He is older than you think. Still wished he could have done it though. And Bat Wing? Not the jet plane the Batman rides in but a guy in an iron suit which has BAT WINGs and looks sorta like Batman is in this. Kinna rip off of ""The Iron Man"" but oh well. It's a good story with plot holes missing...CUZ it's only 72 minutes long! I still loved it esp. at the end when Batgirl shows up! Oh yeah, you have to

Anytime I get to see Nightwing in action is a good day and the addition of Batwing (okay not very original - there is even a joke made about it in the movie) was acceptable as well.

7490671,1,B017757OCW,I'm tired of the media and entertainment industry thinking that the making of a character that's gay is such a driving force for people getting into comics more.  Didn't need to have her in the story and didn't need to have Damien either-feels like another character that was just pushed into the DC universe and not handled very well-just a meaner Jason Todd so why is he a Robin if Jason Todd was killed off for being so opposite of Dick Grayson?,1460160000,2,448,4.463414634146342

7490679,4,B017757OCW,"There were good and bad point to this movie but overall I found it entertaining. This is really more of a 3.5 star movie.

Good Points:
It was fun to seen Damian and Dick work together even if they aren't as close as they are in the comics.
The end fight was amazing and include an amazing scene between Batman, Nightwing, and Robin.
As always I loved the animation style.

Bad Points:
The Batwoman and Batwing characters felt forced and ultimately unnecessary to the story.
The beginning and ending of the movie felt very disjointed from each other. You get 2/3 of the way through the movie and you feel like they reached an (unsatisfying) end, but then they're like no here's the actual end.

Spoilers:
The Heretic characters end was unsatisfying seeing as he played such a big role in the comics.
They teased Batgirl(Barbara Gordon) at the end; I'm excited to see her in later movies",1459382400,3,886,4.594936708860759

SPOILERS: Penguin and Bat girl show up at the end just to let you know there's another movie coming. Star Labs (Green Arrow) and the watchtower (Justice League) were also mentioned at the end. The animation is pretty good, and it is a fun mystery. But the story was rushed to introduce all the cool characters, and kinda leave us wondering what's next.

7490737,5,B017757OCW,"Another good entry in DC/Warner's excellent slate of adaptations of DC graphic novels starring their superhero pantheon. This one is a swift-moving mystery that takes the right amount of time on the character beats, going inside the drama of growing up in the Batman family. We see the troubled hearts and wounded love behind these masks and cowls, as Nightwing, Batwoman, Robin (Damien, Batman's difficult son), and even Alfred struggle to control their regrets and their angers at Batman, even as they race against time to save his life. There is humor, shock, scares, and a steady supply of action hereincluding some violence that will shatter any complacent concepts of what Batman is as a character or a fiction. The creative team has earned its wings on this onethey know these characters and their stories, and freed of the business expectations of blockbuster-or-bust, they are able to give us Batman stories that easily outdo anything the live-action films have done to date. My only quarrel is with Warner Bros: it seems like every time they gin up a new Batman film ""franchise,"" they leave out the creative people who are masters of the material, the Jason O'Maras (and Alan Burnett and Paul Dini) and his collaborators. The c-suites should give the animators 40 or 50 million dollars one day to do an animated film; it would set a generation's expectations for what a Batman movie could be.",1457395200,,1402,4.919831223628692

In that respect, it looks fantastic, the animation is smooth and the highest quality.  On the other hand the story, although alright in it's own right still doesn't quite match up the the older works of DC animation.  It's good, the writing is solid but there was something missing that makes Bad Blood just a shade less thrilling than other works, like Justice League: Gods and Monsters, or Batman: Assault on Arkham.  Overall, still a must have for the collectors like myself, and a good story following up on Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin.

7490757,5,B017757OCW,"First, I know this is a long(ish) review, but please bear with me. I am not a DC fanboy, but I AM a big Batman fan(atic). This is the best animated Batman release since Under the Red Hood and The Dark Knight Returns (the latter being the best of the best). IMO, Son of Batman was a 3.5 and Batman vs. Robin a 2. The Animated Series has some sentimental value for me in its legacy continued in Conroy, Hamill and Harley (and some of its depictions of Dent, Clayface and Captain Clown), but I don't think it has withstood the test of time and is mostly crap (including Mask of the Phantasm). I am also a BIG fan of Williams and Blackmans Kate Kane.

Now that you have an idea behind the history of my taste levels, let me say Bad Blood is awesome. The pacing is constant, the characters are portrayed relatively realistically and the action is FANTASTIC. Its obvious that the screenplay writers know that Bat-Fam fans are sick to death of expositional content for characters we are well acquainted with, and we are given just enough to feel like we know Batwoman and Batwing.

Lastly, let me address a few common criticisms I have read in the amazon reviews of this movie. Batwomans origin is quite light-handed, and any complaints about her part in this movie are either from the impatient and/or homophobic. Anyone complaining about the pacing being too quick has probably read the comics and either lacks perspective in being able to see this movie as a standalone work, or wanted to see the Batman Inc. arc get the attention it deserves. Regardless. every cinematic release based on written work is streamlined in some way; get over it, this movie did it exceptionally well. While its true that Batman isn't in this movie much, it is my opinion that if you only see the various Robins as sidekicks as opposed to independent heroes in their own right, you don't REALLY get Batman at all.

Love is thicker than blood.

I was very disappointed during/after my first run through.
Upon multiple viewings, this is still not a great movie. Other reviewers have complained that the new characters are too shallow, and they are. Batwing and Batwoman are presented very 1 dimensional as people who have seen violence and want to do good their way. Bleh. And including that Batwoman is a lesbian does NOT flesh out her character, although it is cannon, there should have been more time devoted to who she is as bat-person or regular person and the same goes if not more so for Batwing whose entire backstory is dropped in 3 lines. They should have picked one OR the other and given them the proper time to develop character and backstory.

7490796,2,B017757OCW,"The best that can be said is that this movie is better than Justice League: War and Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. But that's really insulting it with faint praise. With an SJW shoehorning of politically correct flat characters in, it's an eye-rolling, take-you-out-of-the-film kind of film. The bad parts:

-The creators seem hell-bent on making Batwoman a major character, despite her not being popular. Also, the emphasis on celebrating her disordered perversion---she's a lesbian---makes this not safe for kids. And way too preachy. The movie tries to normalize her perversion way too hard, but all it shows is that the creators have no idea how lesbians look or act in the real world. She amounts to a feminist-fantasy-tough-grrrrl lesbian that is about as believable as Santa Claus being skinny.

-The addition of the black-computer-whiz-solider-hero Batwing was just laughable. This was basically Cyborg with a different backstory. And, like with Cyborg, his character serves little purpose other than to be the black guy member of the Bat family (who's also a genius and morally incorrupt!), which makes him eye rollingly annoying. Also, because he's the token black guy, he gets no character development. At least Batwoman has a bit of it.

-Making Alfred suddenly a butt-kicker in the end was bad too. It destroys the suspension of disbelief.

-We get nothing that shows Nightwing's actual problems dealing with being in Batman's shadow. All we get is his saying he has issues with it and putting a pained look on his face. His struggle should  have been shown. Instead, we get meaningless Batwing-Lucius scenes and lesbian propaganda.

The movie could have been much better if they'd done the following:

- Instead of the unpopular Batwoman, if they'd really wanted a female outsider to join the Bat family in the film, they could have used Batgirl (which is teased at the end); she's much more popular, and then she and Nightwing could have flirted/had tension that would have worked, instead of everyone knowing everyone.

-Replaced the token black, 2-dimensional Batwing with Jason Todd as Red Hood. Have Jason fight Nightwing as Batman, realize it's not Batman, and have a crisis of conscious when Nightwing and Damian inform him that Bruce is missing and presumed dead. Have Jason disappear, only to reappear at the Church Compound once he realizes that he hates the League of Shadows (which created him through the Lazarus Pits) and a world without Batman more than he hates Bruce. It would also allow him to be the one to distrust Bruce after the escape, and his ruthless nature would make him bond with Damian a bit, creating an interesting dynamic.

-Have Tim Drake make an appearance. He could come back ""for just one more mission"" to save his mentor and don an outfit, or taken the part of the guy back in the cave deciphering the League's hard drive. Three Robins, each dealing with their own issues with Batman---Nightwing coming out of Bruce's shadow, Jason dealing with Bruce failing him, Tim dealing with the fact that he was never the career hero Batman wanted him to be---now that's interesting.

-Remove the SJW-""I'm a lesbian, and it's wonderful!"" scenes and Batwing-Lucius Fox Scenes with scenes of actual character development: show Nightwing struggling to escape Bruce's shadow, Damian struggling to live up to his father's ideals and reject his mother's teaching, Jason Todd dealing with the fact that Bruce wasn't a perfect mentor, Tim struggling with not being a perfect hero, and  Batgirl struggling to be accepted as a crimefighter who isn't just the token girl.",1456531200,,3606,5.0436974789915965

Pros... Damian Wayne makes a good realization

Cons...

Not much Batman (Bruce Wayne)
In general anti-equality of women rhetoric
Obsession with the B-word
Lesbian Dad fights her father
EVERYONE knows Bruce Wayne is Batman
all fighters have the same ninja-like fighting style (including Alfred, oh, it was ridiculous)
Stupid violence (heads exploding, nuns with swords, explosions all the time)
Almost no variety in the voice actors from character to character
Where's Gordon?
Dialogue is weak
and finally, lets let everyone be Batman...really...

Talia Al Ghul is completely transformed, EVERYONE knows Batman's identity and the Batcave. STAAAAP DC!  Everything that makes Batman, well... Batman is being destroyed.  You might as well turn this into a futuristic ninja series where all the characters are dressed as animals...

Bottom line. Every Batman rule is broken in this film. Not to mention it is far-fetched from realism and lacks character development.  Before you know it you'll have the Bat-League with 10 different characters who shoot to kill, reveal their identities to the world and deplete the Wayne's inheritance to pennies.

Since the new 52 took hold DC both on the page and on screen has just lost its sense of wonderment in an attempt to compete with Marvel by being more like Marvel. What was so exciting about DC was how different they were. In the climax of the film I kept thinking about how similar it felt to The Winter Soldier.

At the end of the day it's entertainment right? It's fine for kids too. Whatever, it's a Batman movie I guess. It really just leaves you feeling apathetic.

Honestly I say watch it just to spite all the reviews who disliked it simply because Batwoman is gay, or that it's inappropriate for children because it has a ""lesbian in it."" Gasp! It's 2016.",1455667200,3,929,4.327586206896552

7490827,5,B017757OCW,"The Dark Knight goes full on zero dark thirty.  This has to be the most compelling and complex Batman film I have ever seen.  From the involvement of Cathy Cane as Batwoman to the newest Robin to the animated introduction of Batwing, there is something for every bat-fan in this film.  (Yes, I totally bat-went there.  #Batman66).

This film from DC takes an already dark property and propels it deeper while making one question how much the world really needs a Batman.  This story is the next chapter of a story that began in the DC film Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin.  If one is to look at this as a trilogy, you might think by the third installment that the steam might have rolled out.  This is NOT the case with Batman: Bad Blood.  It remains sharp on point and keeps you hooked.

I also love the storyline with Cathy Cane that keeps in continuity with the storyline started in the New 52 universe.  Spoiler alert!! This film is not child friendly.  This is a more adult oriented film.  If you are offended by sexuality of any kind or innuendos of sexuality, then DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN WATCH THIS FILM UNLESS YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT SUCH THINGS ARE.

This film works great as a stand-alone film.  The folks at DC really know how to make these direct-to-market properties sing for their proverbial supper.  The creative teams are EXCELLENT.  These films stay true to the source material and give you new perspectives and make the stories come alive in a whole new way that resonates.  Hollywood NEEDS to get it together and realize DCUniverse's creative teams should be running the show with the live-action properties.  If they did, DC could finally reclaim a foothold in the feature film blockbuster arena.

Watch this film and you'll see what I mean.  The action is intense.  The storytelling is masterful.  No matter what level of Bat-fan you are, you will find plenty of things to love about Batman: Bad Blood.",1455667200,,1928,4.589442815249267

If Batman does not use guns then why does he have rockets on his car that can level whole buildings? Just curious.  ........By the way did you know batwoman is a lesbian?

Action Ok.  Badguys being bad Ok.
Batwing Seriously a Tony stark Ripoff. a bit much with no sub plot.
Why introduce new characters to rip off others. I know people do it in America all the time but the Marvel DC DC Marvel Ripoff fest has to stop at some point.

My other criticism is that Batwomen's relationship was forced and served no real purpose in the story other than to just show that she's a lesbian.

They need to make her relationship more relevant to the story and not a forced filler piece.

Most of these new movies based off the 52 line are basically an excuse to watch one person hit another, there really is no story here at all. It's just away for dc to introduce their ironman like character and to finish off the story that started in son of batman. Hopefully they will get away from the grant Morrison inspired stories and focus more on stuff like the court of owl and the return of the joker. Then there is the cameo from batgirl at the end, showing that dc is going to ignore gail simone run on the series. I'm really starting to not like these movies.

7490914,3,B017757OCW,"""Bad Blood"" is the latest movie Batman animated movie and while it was an entertaining film, there were a number of details that stopped me from enjoying it as much as I had some of DC's recent animated outings.

The first and foremost is the lack of characterization with the newer characters, Batwoman and Batwing. Now, this movie is only 72-minutes long including credits so I realize there isn't a lot of time to flesh out every detail about them, but by and large what we are given is lacking and at times irritating. For example, the movie seems incredibly preoccupied in reminding the viewer that Batwoman is a lesbian every 5 or so minutes. She's taking to her family, they talk about her being a lesbian. She's at the bar, starts hitting on another famous Gotham City lesbian (fans of the comics of the ""Gotham"" TV show can probably guess). Talking to Nightwing, mentions she's a lesbian. It's really disappointing that DC and the writers of this film decided that this would be her one main identifying trait instead of fleshing her out more as a character. I'm sorry if this sounds homophobic, I really don't mean it as such, but I'm more interested in learning about Batwoman the character and not so much having the movie continuously tell me ""Hey, she likes GIRLS. How about that, huh?""

And on the flipside is Batwing. He is given about two sentences of exposition about who he is in the entire film, and that is about it. Further, while I haven't followed Batwing much in the comics, in this show it feels like they just wanted to have a character with their own set of Iron Man-esque armor. Seriously, there was a certain part at the climax of the movie that felt completely lifted from the first Avengers movie. You'll know it when you see it. Maybe if he's included in another Batman film they can expand on his character, but for now he very much felt like a character they included just for plot convenience.

One other gripe I had with this movie was how it dispatched the villains. It seems gone are the days of sending criminals to Arkham and Blackgate- here some villains are just straight up taken out like they were in a Mark Millar comic. While some fans might enjoy this, I was disappointed with how they handled it. It felt dismissive of Batman's code of conduct and felt more like it was treading into Punisher territory. I won't give away spoilers here, but parents out there, this would be a good place to notify/ remind you: THIS IS NOT A KID'S FRIENDLY ANIMATED FILM.

This isn't to say this is a bad movie- if I was given more stars to work with, I'd probably would rate it 7/10. The fight scenes are still very well done and ho-hum characterizations notwithstanding, the movie moves at a decent pace and doesn't bog down anywhere. Further as a sequel to last year's Batman Vs. Robin, it does it job admirably in this regard. But all in all, I suggest this more as a rental than an outright purchase.",1454716800,33,2936,4.533962264150944

Any batfan of any era will enjoy this.  There are references to the 1950's, '60's, and '70's throughout the movie.  Grayson's Batman is spot on ""the caped crusader"" as opposed to Bruce's ""dark knight.""  Damian once again steals the show.  Maybe if they continue this timeline we will eventually get Ms. Kyle.

7490944,5,B017757OCW,"DC has once again released another delicacy for The Batman, this time expanding the roster of the family. I am vaguely familiar with Batwing and Batwoman, but their appearances here were woven into the fabric of the existing characters quite nicely for what DC & Warner Brothers started since Jason O'Mara began his tenure as Batman. The action borders on the edge of a PG-13 rating, and parents are appropriately cautioned about this. This seems to blend particular storylines in the Batman universe, especially when it is revealed who the initial protagonist is. It was enough of a ""What?!"" moment to make me want to investigate this further. Unless this is something new for the movie, you'll recognize the scene immediately.

We are treated to a bit of a surprise at the end, enough of a surprise to tantalize the imagination. Mmmm hmmm.

The Nightwing figure included with the Deluxe Edition stands at 4 inches tall. No part of him moves so he stands as is, on a base. However, the figure is sculpted nicely and for a few extra bucks, it is worth having.

7490992,4,B017757OCW,"So I'm a fan of these DC animated movies, I even have a review of one I did last year, (justice League gods and monsters), so this would be my second review of a DC animated feature. This is basically a batman is missing story and the sidekicks have to cover Gotham in his absence and figure out what happened to him. It introduces batwoman who to me seemed like a mix of red hood and batgirl since she had batgirls look and red hoods willingness to kill, (batman stops her from doing so of course), batwing who is Lucius Fox's son equipped in a bat-themed Ironman like suit, and the villain heretic who I won't  spoil anything about. It has good action and a decent plot, with knightwing having to masquerade as batman to make Gotham criminals think the bat is still in town which I thought was very interesting to see. I knock one star off due to the reveal of the bad guys endgame or masters plan I should say. I felt like so many movies and video games have done it before, but again I won't spoil anything. This was a minor thing and didn't  ruin the movie for me at all, however I feel this keeps it from getting that 5th star. Overall good film, I rate it higher than batman vs Robin but a little lower than under the red hood. If you follow these yearly animated releases like I do, check this one out.",1453507200,3,1310,4.2151394422310755

7490997,5,B017757OCW,"DC's golden goose holds true to form!  Fans of Batman and his expanded universe will really enjoy this movie. Particularly, fans of the original Robin, now Nightwing. Great use of fresh characters with good, albeit rushed, storylines. If Marvel can get away with Antman, then DC gets a pass with Batwing. The Damien/Dick dynamic plays well and the honesty to the source material makes for a gritty, fun, and genuinely interesting take on Batman's influence and resolve. It doesn't get much better than this in an hour.",1453507200,,518,4.954022988505747

7490999,4,B017757OCW,"I've not been a huge fan of the more recent crop of DC animated movies, from JL:war to Batman vs Robin, the latter of which was decent, but in my opinion wasted the potential of the Court of Owls. Anyway though, I wasn't expecting much from this, but being a huge fan of the bat-family, along several incarnations, I had to give this a shot. Overall, pretty solid movie, for fans of any Batman continuity (it's kinda a mix of new52 comics and prior, along with doing it's own thing). Does justice to every character they include in the film except for maybe one of the villains.

I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars, because, while solid, it's not really got anything going for it that makes me elevate it to ""great"". The animation is actually really good, but the overall story comes across as kinda familiar with the villain plotting, even if you're just going by the more recent crop of animated batman movies. In fairness though, I've read, watched, and played through tons of batman stories. What's new is the inclusion of more members of the bat-family, with the inclusion of Bat-Woman and Batwing (both worthy additions, and though I'm a fan of the bat-family, I don't have that much love for those two characters in particular, but this story made me like them), and a much larger role from Nightwing than the previous entries. Even if some elements of the plot felt a little derivative though (and I don't mean based loosely on comics the movie is more or less based on), it fits together pretty well and the ending feels mostly earned. The story could add a little to it's run time to develop some of the characters and their relationships better, but at the same time, the story kinda works as it is so keeping it shorter didn't hurt my enjoyment.

I was pleasantly surprised by a few things throughout, and I think anyone who watches will be too, which kinda makes it worth the watch just on that note. Definitely the best of this current animated DC universe, which, admittedly, from me, doesn't mean much, but still.",1453248000,,2027,4.550684931506849

But was it still a high class rootin tootin fast paced cerebral classic awesome puncher up, you bet you right nut! And theirs some GREAT gore. Would not advise for kids under 8. Also as other people have been saying this movie gives them the set up for the story ""the killing joke"" Which would be just as good as dark knight parts 1&2. And if they didn't get someone from the original art team to help them then F' em they aint gettin my money. That was half of what made that series amazing.  Sorry for the rant. TL:DR : great movie don't listen to people badmouthing the story its plenty complicated and not advisable for kids. Also their are lesbians in this movie GET OVER IT IT'S NORMAL BEHAVIOR, and if you don't agree you should kill yourself, like asap, humanity might start to actually evolve again...",1453248000,,878,4.386503067484663

8738203,4,B017757OCW,"This movie probably would have worked great if the entire Damian trilogy had been done as a arc for a season in a series rather than a movie only because of Talia's change of personality.  At the end of ""Son of Batman"" her parting seems completely amicable and she even tells Batman to make their son great.  However, in this she has become deranged and loves neither Batman nor her son.  It can be easily explained that by dying and being revived the Lazarus Pits caused her to go insane.  That because she was revived so quickly she at first appeared fine but the madness claimed her later.  This would make the most sense and probably could have been shown in a multi-episode event.  Unfortunately the movie never offers that explanation and instead has the characters thinking she was always deranged from the start.  Which does not fit with Talia taking a bullet for Damian in the first movie nor her decision to leave Damian with Bruce.  Characters are not perfect so the characters thinking that would have been fine but a series arc could have shown her descent into madness that would have left the audiences knowing what actually happened and potentially have Bruce figuring it out after he had time to deprogram.
We also could have gotten to know Batwoman better (her origin is a bit rushed since she was already established when we saw her in the beginning and had her origin told in the flashback).  (And people need to get over the fact that Batwoman's a lesbian.  And just for the record, Batgirl does appear at the very end of the movie so Batwoman and Batgirl are not the same person.)  Batwing was handled as well as could be since this was his origin story.",1526774400,,1676,4.5719063545150505

Batwing
Batgirl..she shows up in the end leaving an Easter egg of knowing she's going to be apart of the next either teen titans or batman animated movie.
