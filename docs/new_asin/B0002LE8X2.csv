8029004,3,B0002LE8X2,"Nadesico is a great anime series that makes fun of itself as well as the entire history/genre of robot anime.  Taking pieces from Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mazinger, Voltron, Star Blazers (aka Space Battleship Yamato) and other series... this show combines action, comedy, drama, and cool character development.  Portions of this show go from slapstick comedy (Akito's scene when he runs into Yurika) to deadly serious (Jiro aka Guy's death).",1297123200,,441,5.3768115942028984
8029005,5,B0002LE8X2,"Martian Successor Nadesico is indeed one of my personal favorite Japanese anime series of all time, and I will also have to say that it is probably THE best in the sci-fi/comedy department. The series has a tragic plot, and there are also tragic moments, but the main classification for this series would be a mechomedy (mecha/comedy). What's nice about these reissues is that you get more for less. For instance, you can buy the ""Complete Chronicles"" 6-disc box set for 90 bucks. OR, you can buy the six individual discs (Invasion, Mission To Mars, Danger Zones, Paradigm Shifts, Secrets and Lies, and Endgame) for 30 bucks a pop. OR STILL, you could check the bargain bin for the twelve VHS volumes (I have the first two, volume 1 dubbed and volume 2 subtitled, but I think I'm gonna sell them).

However, this is a 2 disc set with a grand total of 9 episodes for a mere 20 dollars. Plus, on the first episode, you can turn on a commentary track with English actors Brett Weaver (Gai Daigoji), Mark X. Laskowski (Jun Aoi), and John Swasey (Seiyaa Uribatake), as well as ADR director Matt Greenfield (also credited as Brian Granveldt). Disc 2 also features a nifty gallery of production sketches, character bios of pretty much all the important members of the Nadesico's crew, clean opening and closing animation sequences, and trailers (duh).

Ultimately, I would highly recommend this series. It has hilarious romantic comedy coupled with intense sci-fi action and beautiful character designs by Keiji Gotou (who designed the characters on Those Who Hunt Elves and Sorcerer Hunters, directed animation on Blue Seed episodes 8, 13 and 17, and was a key animator on many episodes of my all time fave, Neon Genesis Evangelion).
