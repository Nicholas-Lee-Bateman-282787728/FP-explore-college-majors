6822113,5,B00PUXTO90,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When I first got the press release for BROTHERHOOD OF BLADES, I knew instantly I wanted to see it based on the title alone.  I mean, how can you not be interested in a film with a title like that?  It just screams Watch me!  Im glad I gave it a look because this film is an epic historical drama with an intriguing storyline and excellent fight scenes.  If you're a fan of of movies like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, then you will want to check this one out soon.

I knew I was going to like this film from the start.  It contains a gripping story with believable characters and intense action.  But it is also a compelling period piece that shows the value of honor and how family is not defined by blood.  In short, the film is epic in scope and vision, as well as execution.

BROTHERHOOD OF BLADES is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The cinematography is a big part of what makes this movie so excellent from a visual standpoint.  It also helps convey the importance of key scenes and adds to the intensity of the battles.

The acting is superb as well.  The actors who portray the Jinyiwei each do an outstanding job and bring their characters to life with vivid detail.  Their emotional performances lend a huge amount of credibility to the onscreen drama and set the tone for the film as a whole.  I particularly enjoyed Chen Changs portrayal of Shen Lian, the main character.  Chang is a great fighter, but hes also a true actor, which makes the movie even better.

The battle sequences in BROTHERHOOD OF BLADES are also amazing.  Theres martial-arts action, but its not the wire-work-filled displays that modern day audiences are used to; this is not a bad thing, as I love those kinds of movies as well.  But the lack of over-exaggerated fight scenes makes this movie even more believable.

BROTHERHOOD OF BLADES is a huge win for me and I highly recommend it.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray, so you can enjoy the superior picture quality and HD sound.  You won't regret it.",1423699200,14,2124,4.428940568475452
6822114,5,B00PUXTO90,"Just saw this film on the big screen and can hardly wait for Well Go USA to do their superb job of bringing it to us in February on Blu Ray & DVD.  Set in the Ming period it requires all the cunning and resourcefulness of trained assassins to protect the secrets of the dynasty.  In 111 minutes they try their best against enemies within and without never quite sure who is behind the facades of the palace and their lives.  Sat through it twice just to be sure I got all the subtleness of what takes place, all the martial arts action, and all the drama.  Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did.",1419811200,18,602,4.119658119658119

6822134,3,B00PUXTO90,"Set in Beijing in the last days of the Ming Dynasty (13681644), Brotherhood of Blades (Xiu chun dao) follows the story of three sworn brothers and imperial assassins Shen Lian (Chen Chang), Lu Jianxing (Qianyuan Wang) and Jin Yichuan (Dong-xue Li). They all get involved with a conspiracy when they are ordered to kill a once powerful court eunuch Wei Zhongxian (Shih-Chieh Chin).

For all the decent production designs, I was not impressed with the film itself perhaps because I have seen so many Chinese period costume action movies before. I didn't find Brotherhood of Blades really unique or original in any respect, I mean, story-wise or action-wise.

The film spends too much time following melodramatic subplots that only slow down the main one about the protagonists. What most viewers want is of course action, and there are plenty of martial arts action sequences, but the choreography is not particularly imaginative, and the overuse of fast cut and shaky camera is not something that we want from this kind of film.

Like most recent Chinese period martial arts actioners Brotherhood of Blades looks great, but viewers, especially avid fans of the genre, may feel they have seen the same film before.",1441929600,2,1212,5.019900497512438

But seriously, it's definitely a different movie then many of the martial art ones out there.  It's got excellent acting, very nice shots and scenery and what really is, in a way a different story.  Well it's actually a fairly familiar story if you watch crime drama movies, but setting it in ancient China definitely adds a new twist.",1430265600,5,442,4.4875

Three men, bound by friendship and the same career path as imperial assassin's work together to further themselves...but at what cost? There are some familiar western archetypes here, but the story is original and the acting great. I don't get how someone wouldn't enjoy this as an action film. There's a couple of love stories intertwined, a touch of comedic moments and lots of espionage/intrigue throughout. This movie kept me thinking and yet it's an action flick. I appreciate that immensely.",1529107200,,599,4.9405940594059405

It has tons of epic sword fighting martial arts, not of the slow and flying kind you see in ""Hero"" or whatever, but fast, gritty, and more realistic sword fighting. It's really cool.
