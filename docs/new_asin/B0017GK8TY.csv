8265800,5,B0017GK8TY,"I have this reg. 4 DVD of BOYS IN BROWN.  It's a clear version, and the movie gives us a knockout early performance by the fine British actor DIRK BOGARDE.

BUT I'm glad to hear that VCI Entertainment is releasing a reg. 1 DVD of BOYS IN BROWN so I can view it on any U.S. player and not just my multi-region dvd player. It also means it will run in my PC or MAC.  Not all DVDs from other regions do.

It's always good news to have a favorite film available in various regions.",1354752000,,477,3.9894736842105263
