8522527,5,B007WE6RBS,"I have this concert in my collection and I enjoy it very much. Anyone who is a fan should have this concert in their collection because it is the last time that he was able to perform for us. Marvelous singing Freddy, we miss you. You made us proud. I am now looking for a copy of the concert by the texas tornados performed at the gruene hall in gruene texas in 1992 and broadcast on the bbc. I have seen bits and pieces and it looks fab but I would like to have the concert all together. Does anyone have a complete copy? Thanks",1373500800,,530,4.057142857142857
8522528,5,B007WE6RBS,Love Freddy Fender any thing I his I enjoy.  I think he is probably one of the most underated country stars of all time.  He was definatly real.  Not one of these modern marketed guys.,1343779200,,184,4.2
