8522105,5,B007V2LND8,"The second collection was cool, very unique and interesting. A little humor, I have to admit the ending is an unforgettable I've never seen a ending like that. You will never regret buying The Book of Bantorra anime. It's that good",1364601600,,231,4.658536585365853
8522106,4,B007V2LND8,"I had to think about this for awhile before writing the review. Obviously if anyone bought Collection 1 you have to buy Collection 2 to see the end of
the story. So this is not about whether anyone should purchase Collection 2 or not. My problem was what exactly do I say about Collection 2. The focus
is more on the Nolity character depicted on the cover artwork. But it soon takes a much darker tone I than even part one. I'm not going to spoil the
storyline so that's all I will say. It's how the story is wrapped up and brought to conclusion that had me scratching my head. In ancient Greece when
a playwrite couldn't decide how to end the story they would lower another actor to the stage on a platform as if he where a messenger decending from the
gods. Simply as a diversion so the audience wouldn't feal cheated in some way. I think the expression for that is ""deus ex machina"". Anyway I sort of
feal that is what happens at the end of Bantorra. Which accounts for my four out of five star rating. Like going from abc to xyz by skipping all the
letters in between. The story touches on some universal themes at the end. I just fealt there was a better way to wrap it all up. I would not be surprised
if most on first viewing have the reaction; ""What the H--- is going on here."" In conclusion as I said in my review for Collection 1 if you are a big fan
of anime it is worth adding to your collection. Too dark and heavy for young children but I enjoyed it and I recommend it. It will make you think and that
is not a bad thing after all.",1360195200,2,1545,4.102310231023102
8522107,5,B007V2LND8,"Anime was better than I expected. I watched the first collection of Book of Bantorra and I just needed to see the rest of it. A little sketchy at first from the first collection, but after watching a few more times it really caught me.",1349654400,,235,4.2444444444444445
8522108,5,B007V2LND8,"Excellent series and story with a newer bent.  It's hard to find really superb titles anymore that aren't regurgitated plots from at least something that's already been done - but BofB pulls it off.  I love Hamyuts, even her name...she is a bad-ass from the start (yes, we've seen the ultra strong female leads - she's just different.)

The story quickly, is about some rough and tumble ""cosmic librarians"" that help control the ""books"" we leave behind after dying.  Throw in the bad guys who want ""X"" book for their own reasons and it's a 100%, full time job.  Add a little ""crazy as hell"" acting director Hamyuts Maseta of the librarians, and we get some truly organic and quite spectacular fight scenes.  (Without spoiling anything you can see, while our character line up cares about their respective jobs, most are in it just as much for the ability to throw a beating...and they're very good at it!)  You have to wait a little while to see the back stories but it's well worth it.  Book of Bantorra is a solid addition to almost any collection!  Highly recommended!!",1347840000,3,1072,4.659574468085107
8522109,3,B007V2LND8,"This is the second half of the story, and it does tie up loose ends.  The setting is interesting, and I like the characters.  But I'm not rating it higher because it's a weird story.  Some of the stuff they set up in the first half don't play any part in the second half.  They introduce new things and new parts of the story that seem like they're meant to explain certain things, but they don't really explain anything.  They're just new chunks of story.

I like the anime overall, but I'm also left feeling... unsatisfied.  If you have a particular love of stories that go off in weird directions like Akira and Evangelion, then this might suit your taste.",1342915200,5,659,4.441666666666666
