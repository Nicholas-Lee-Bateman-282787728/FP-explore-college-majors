8447288,4,B004XNSEPS,"Very entertaining especially for a true story,and what I read about it said that it followed the actual facts and events closely.  More closely than most movies based on true stories. One issue I had  were the prolific sex scenes. Both how many  there were and the lengthy duration of the various scenes. I realize that sex is a big part of the drug dealers culture but it just seemed a little more than necessary. Otherwise I would've given the show at five.",1467590400,,459,4.506024096385542

8447292,5,B004XNSEPS,"I watched and enjoyed the 1st season and, even though this has new characters and actors, I enjoyed this just as much.  My only criticism is that the music drowns out the narrator at times.  Great story and great actors.",1389657600,,220,4.475
8447293,4,B004XNSEPS,I give this 4and a half stars. I liked Season one better in that it was tighter and sometimes in the beginning I was not sure who was who. Aside from this it is in my opinion the second best underbelly in the series.,1369699200,,216,3.9318181818181817
8447294,5,B004XNSEPS,"Pros:

1.) There was a good deal of nudity & violence

2.) The filming technique reminds me of a Guy Ritche movie

3.) Shows how unorganized ""organized crime"" crime can be

4.) Really good soundtrack

5.) I increased my knowledge of Australian slang

Cons:

1.) It was difficult to figure out the actual organizational structure of the ""Moran Mob"" (referred to in the series as the ""Carlton Crew""). With the exception of the Loan Sharking (Mario) and the attempt of the Moran Brothers to get into the ""X"" business, it was difficult to ascertain what everyone else was into. I couldn't even figure out to the last disc that Mick was the defacto head of the crew. Perhaps it is me, though I tend to like details and enjoy doing the ""math"" re: ill gotten gains. Unless I missed it there were only 2 references to money/profits (other than the cost of having someone killed): interest rates that Mario charged and some loose references to the production costs versus sale price of ""X""

2.) For mobsters these guys were sorely lacking in the personal protection arena. No bullet proof cars, trained body guards, etc. Alphonse (AKA ""The Black Prince"") was the only one that even seemed to have a home security system, which apparently doesn't alert you when the front door is left open! Also, I don't think that I saw anyone ""sweep"" for listening devices! Perhaps things are done differently in Australia, however, anywhere else in the world and relative to the money that some of these guys were supposedly earning, I would have thought that they would have protected themselves better

All in I would give the series 4-1/2-stars, though still falling short on an aggregate basis to the Sopranos (some seasons were better than others) and not in the same league as ""The Wire.""",1337558400,,1771,4.742671009771987
8447295,5,B004XNSEPS,"Underbelly has set the tone for a new exciting style of true crime genre television in Australia. As the first installment this series has left a lasting impression on me. The conglomeration of ""Gangland War"" events was well presented with a solid cast, and an entertaining combination of drama and action. Whilst there may be inaccuracies with regards to some of the events, the series still provides a storyline that is generally confirmed by facts. Underbelly doesn't hold back on exhilaration with plenty of brutal and raunchy scenes. Despite violence and even debauchery presented as regular themes, there is a good amount of humour and great acting, which makes this series one of Australia's best.

8447296,5,B004XNSEPS,"And this is pretty much how it happened.

Well cast, well acted and well scripted, this is an easy to watch series that reminds you that crime doesn't pay for most.

Highly recommended.",1301529600,2,185,4.575757575757576
