295867,5,6300271293,The movie was in excellent condition. It was every bit as describe. It brought back childhood memories. I was really impressed with the quality of the video and the case. Thank you very much for this sale.,1349481600,,205,4.5675675675675675
295868,4,6300271293,This is a true cult classic. Many years ago i watched this movie with my 2 kids when they were small. It frightened them at first but then they started to sympathize with Ratboy and both cried at the treatment he received from those he thought would help him. I recently showed it to my grand kids and they haven't talked about nothing else. I love this movie !!!,1347235200,,363,4.27536231884058
295869,4,6300271293,"OK - so this is not the greatest movie ever made. Still, it has the lure of a traffic accident that you cannot turn away from as you pass. Take a chance and put yourself into Ratboy's shoes...",1260662400,3,192,4.078947368421052
295870,5,6300271293,"During my active transition from childhood to adolesence, I watched two movies. Those two movies were ""Night of the Comet"" and ""Ratboy"", which were selected based on nothing more than youthful curiosity. I am now a thirty-four year adult male that inadvertantly remembered chronically watching ""Ratboy"" and had to find a copy. It was the amazing seller ""markgrizzly"" that sold me this movie and it arrived in unbelievably amazing condition! After more than twenty years of last viewing this movie, I watched ""Ratboy"" in the privacy of my home on a relaxing Saturday afternoon. In short, it was just as bizarre and entertaining as I recalled from my youth. This film would be ideal for the individual (male or female) that requires a simple tale of genetically mutated human-rat hybrid that was unknowingly destined to become a special manifestation of cinematic history and my younger self.",1252281600,5,890,5.102739726027397
295871,4,6300271293,"This movie is for kids between 6-13.
It revolves around adults trying to exploit an abberant boy who's about 10yrs old.
It is amusing and has a little profanity. There is a car chase or two.
But this is a really unique movie. I had to get it for my kids. They liked it.",1250208000,3,269,4.0

295873,5,6300271293,One of the greatest films of all time right up there with the Godfather.. i been a Rayboy fan for years this movie will go to the grave with me ..,1207440000,,146,3.7419354838709675
295874,3,6300271293,"Lots of 80's ""B"" movies coming out on DVD. You will see pigs fly before this one ever does. Really, what a strange and pointless movie. Last time I saw this was on a midnight movie back in the late 90's. Ummm, it's got Louie Anderson in it. Here is an idea it could be remade, and Tim Burton could direct it! I could see that happening. Now, Frog Dreaming (also called ""The Quest"") is a movie that needs to come out on DVD before this one does.",1189209600,,444,4.056818181818182
