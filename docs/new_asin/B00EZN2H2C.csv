8610853,4,B00EZN2H2C,"This film has a very low level of presentation of detail, the translations are minimal and in pidgin English at best. The message is still perfectly clear. People prefer freedom to oppression. The innocence, simplicity, and strength of the Tibetan people are plain to see. The Chinese hatred and brutality are there to see as well as the compassion and strength of the Tibetan mind, which they attribute to Buddhist practices such as meditation. Fully documented are the Chinese techniques of brainwashing and propagandistic lying, imprisonment, torture. beatings and killings. Instead of genocide, the Chinese are trying to break the spirit of the Tibetan people and obliterate their culture. It is plain to see that if pressure is applied by governments outside of Tibet that this has results inside Tibet. Thank you, Amazon, for making this video available to me.",1514073600,,866,5.192857142857143
8610854,4,B00EZN2H2C,"""Tibet: Beyond Fear"" (2008 release; 55 min.) is a tough documentary on the human rights abuses that China has inflicted (and I suppose is still inflicting) upon Tibet and its people. We all know that Tibet once was an independent country, which China invaded in the early 1950s. Since then, China has been relentless in its attempt to 'assimilate' the Tibetan people into the Chinese way of thinking.

The documentary is primarily built around the interviews of two people, a young Tibetan Buddhist monk and nun (the latter being only a young teenager) who in the early 1990s decided to speak out for a free Tibet and ""long live Dalai Lama"". They describe in gruesome details how they are tortured again and again, and almost starve to death. The conditions of the Drapchi prison where they are held are beyond belief. It also includes some footage of the Chinese army's brutal repression of the monks peaceful demonstrations. The interviews and interwoven with snippets of the Dalai Lama making appearances around the world, including his speech to the US Congress in 1987 and again in 2007. The most amazing thing is that in the end, both the Tibetan monk and nun (now in their early-40s and mid-30s, respectively), are able to overcome the years of torture and can live ""beyond fear"".

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this documentary is brutal in its descriptions and details surrounding the torture which the monk and nun underwent, so this is not for the faint of heart. Second, Richard Gere (credited as ""Chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet"") appears for about 1 minute at the very beginning. Third, I have no idea why this documentary, which was made in 2008, is getting a re-release at this particular time. Fourth, this is a bare-bones DVD release: no extras, minimal packaging, etc. and in that sense given its short running time, it feels like watching an episode of PBS Frontline. That aside, if you are interested in the fate of Tibet and its people, this is worth checking out, be it on DVD or on Amazon Instant Video.",1384473600,3,2054,4.81586402266289
