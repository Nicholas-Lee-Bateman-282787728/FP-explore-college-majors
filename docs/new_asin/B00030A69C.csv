2155296,5,B00030A69C,This training video series has been a great help in guiding my U10 son into the mindset of keeping.  The videos present basic skills and training exercises that he has emulated when he is in the box.,1180051200,6,199,4.378378378378378
2155297,5,B00030A69C,"Almost three hours of GKing detail.  There is so much detail in each topic that I need to go over each topic at least 3 times to get most of it.  I've seen college math texts which were less dense in the amount of detail they included.  This is in direct contrast to high profile DVDs done by Beckham and Man U that are more sizzle than steak.

Demonstrations are done with a young adult male, a young teen girl, and a younger boy so show what are reasonable to expect for different age groups.  He also has clips from professional games analyzing in several replays with slow motion and stop action what works and what doesn't and why.

There are a ton of details on goal keeping I never knew.  I thought I had read a lot and I've been to several GK-ing clinics run by professional GKers and GKing coaches for pro teams but this goes into a lot of detail about the stance, how to come out for the ball, how to hold your hands, when to react, when to wait and even the stance while waiting.

There are also practices for the GKing coach which go into great detail on what to do and what to avoid in running the practice and doing the exercise.  How many times to do the exercise for each age group, what success is and what is unacceptable in the player.

Wisely he says that until 15 or 16, there is no need to specialize, and especially at the younger ages, every player should play every position.

This is made from a set of VHS tapes but it is still very nice and clear to watch and hear - assuming you don't mind mild Scottish accents.

FWIW, I coach my two sons in age groups 8-9 and 13-14.  Some love GKing and some do it because its their turn to do it, but they all are becoming better Gkers and this DVD set helps, especially the older players.",1125878400,69,1755,4.172106824925816

8035657,4,B00030A69C,"This video does a great job going over some basics. Granted some positions and skills are not what i would teach but we should never limit ourselves to one resource, camp or coach to learn.",1359331200,,189,4.428571428571429
8035658,5,B00030A69C,"Tools and techniques are explained in a way that is easy to understand.  The DVD also does a nice job of breaking down real game footage to demonstrate things that work well, and things that don't.",1324857600,,197,4.472222222222222
8035659,4,B00030A69C,took a while to arrive but was worth it. great coaching aid for young goal keepers and coaches. loads of drills and pointers to improve technique. will def make a big difference to your clean sheets record,1324339200,,205,4.5675675675675675
8035660,3,B00030A69C,"One of the earlier reviewers said that he has seen college math exams that were less dense in the amount of information covered. However, the problem I found with Keeper! is that it is maybe TOO dense.

Like that previous reviewer, I too had to review each disk several times to be able to commit it to memory. There are a few reasons for this:
1. While it does offer some exercises and drills, it is heavy on theory and shorter on ""hands on"" ideas
2. I don't know if it's the accent or something else, but the narration does tend to become droning.
3. On many of the examples they show using professional goal keepers, they repeat the clip several times when once would suffice.

That being said, the information that IS given is complete, accurate, and ""spot on"".

Pros: You get A LOT of information in one DVD set; the information is accurate and up-to-date (some old clips, but the principles have not changed); it's available to begin with (look around on here, there are not a lot of goal keeping DVDs to begin with); Waiters uses a combination of his own live players and clips from professional players to emphasize his points

Cons: Becomes very tedious to watch / drones on; not a lot of drills for individual goalie training

Bottom Line: It's not so much as a DVD-based ""handbook"" with steps to train a good goal keeper as it is a DVD-based ""textbook"" with theory and some ideas for making a goal keeper better.",1321574400,8,1423,4.5
8035661,4,B00030A69C,This two DVD set has good information and is useful for the goalkeeper and trainer.,1244160000,,83,4.6
8035662,5,B00030A69C,"I purchased this DVD over a year ago and gave it to my goalkeepers to watch, but didn't really watch it myself until my own son decided he wanted to try being a goalkeeper.  We watch it together a lot these days and I must say I am really very impressed.  I have played and coached soccer for over 35 years and this is an awesome training dvd.  It is well paced, has great photography, and is very clear and straight forward.  I tried to find some flaws in it, but could not find anything I did not agree with throughout the entire 2 DVDs.",1235433600,2,539,4.104761904761904
8035663,4,B00030A69C,"Good video on two DVD's that teach the basics of goal keeper stance and position and sample practice sessions. If you coach competitive soccer or high school, this a a great video and worth the money. If you are looking for a more advanced video, this may not be the video for you. Personally, I like to view other professional coach's techniques and ideas. If you want a little more advanced, although you can NEVER get away from the basics, try ""Goalkeeping- The DiCicco Method (set of three videos)"" through ""soccer learning systems"" on-line. Good source of training videos and inexpensive.",1226188800,9,593,4.881188118811881
