1880826,3,B000096IAM,"STACY takes place in a world where teenaged girls everywhere are succumbing to a mysterious condition known as ""near death happiness.""  These girls fall into a dreamlike, ecstatic state before suddenly expiring - and shortly thereafter, rising again as cannibalistic zombies.  There is no cure, so parents are urged to kill their own daughters.  If they can't do the job themselves, special troops can be called in to do it for them.
An insert included with the DVD package talks about a Japanese concept that describes the obsession many people have with innocence and beauty and things they can't have, and also the notion that by destroying something, you set it free.  Even though this is touched on near the end of the film, it is a bit difficult to ascribe such depth to a film in which girls in bunny suits hawk chainsaws dubbed ""Bruce Campbell's right hand"" on TV for the purpose of using it on NDH victims, and in which a young man embraces an undead girl (who is gagged for his protection, of course) and claims she is his lover.  Had the film been more serious than silly, I'd be more inclined to find meaning in it.  (I can't help but think such a film could have been quite good.)  In any case, you can take it or leave the critical analysis as you please; whatever works for you.
As it stands, STACY is an often funny, gory, moderately entertaining movie.  It is also - strangely - occasionally sweet, although again it is hard to take it too seriously.  If you are into zombies or schoolgirls or both, and you enjoy the zany Asian attitude toward horror, you will probably enjoy this movie on some level.
DVD notes: This release from Synapse is pretty basic.  English subtitles are optional, and default to on which is appreciated.  There is also a trailer.  The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen.",1067212800,31,1821,4.62111801242236

I found this movie to be like a bad car accident you just cannot resist watching this movie. I mean one point one character says that he is love with one the Stacies, and want to run away with her. And at one point they say that Stacies and men end up have offspring, which is so wrong on many levels I mean (...) is messed up.
I like the little Easter egg within this movie the Romeos, the army that hunts the Stacies, which in tribute to horror legend George Romero, and The Bruce Campbell right hand saws, which is reference to Bruce Campbell's famous role as Ashley (Ash) J. Williams.
I would have say this film is guilt little pleasure (...)",1066780800,,742,4.2695035460992905
1880828,4,B000096IAM,"For some strange and unexplained reason all girls aged 15 to 17 die. In Japan this tragic event happens during schooltime, so when the girls come back to life as cute-looking but flesh-hungry zombies, they go around in those (to me) sexy uniforms killing and eating people. Since this is a situation most people under 15 and above 17 are not satisfied, the government has founded a special section to deal with the problem.
HOT ASIAN ZOMBIE CHICKS! I liked this movie. Although the only problem I had with this film is there is too much lovey dovey rubbish and can get irritating.

And there are zombies.  Rather gross looking zombies.  But that isn't the main draw to the movie... at least not for me.  The main draw was that in all of this gore (which was enjoyable none the less) were characters.  And characters who actually were likeable!  These people are just that, people.  And it shows that one of the greatest powers, that can even raise the dead, is love.  Odd for a horror movie, but for some reason it works.  And the thing is... it has a happy ending.

That said, if you love zombie movies, basement budget B-movies, gore, earnest sincerity by extremely socially inept characters, gore, strange concepts made stranger by surreal cinematic effects , creepy examinations of the intersection of sex, death, and innocence, and more gore, you might like this movie.

I'm not making any guarantees.  The existential love story wrapped in zombie gore is not for everyone.  But I cried the second or third time I watched it, which is unusual for me and any film.  No one I've shown it to has reacted similarly - responses include laughter (my response, too, on first viewing), horror, annoyance, and boredom.

1880831,3,B000096IAM,"Stacy (Naoyuki Tomomatsu, 2001)

It's official: the Japanese really do do everything better than the Americans when it comes to horror movies. They even make bad ones better. And make no mistake, Stacy (also known as Stacy: Attack of the Schoolgirl Zombies, depending on whose DVD you happen to be watching) is a bad, bad movie. But at least it recognizes its own badness and plays accordingly. And despite its badness, the amount of care put into the script here easily rivals most decent mainstream movies in America.

Before I get round to apologizing to the rest of the world for the American film industry, let me get back onto the subject. Stacy opens with the premise that, a few years before, schoolgirls between the ages of 15 and 17 all over the world started dying of a mysterious illness and coming back as zombies. Which allows both the schoolgirl-uniform fetish and zombie fetish their full reign. But that's beside the point. There are two main stories we follow. The first, and more ""important"" in the greater scheme of things, concerns high school girl Eiko (""my name is spelled with the character for eternity!""), played by Battle Royale II's Natsuki Kato. Convinced she's going to die soon, she seeks out someone whom she can trust to put her down when she rises as a zombie. She stumbles upon Shibukawa (Toshinori Omi of The Drifting Classroom), a puppeteer whose business has gone south in the wake of the epidemic. Their story is your basic love story. The other involves the Romero Repeat Kill troops, who are charged with putting the zombies down and disposing of their bodies. This is where the movie gets its blood (and most of its comedy) from. It's a sort of weird cross between Day of the Dead and Men Behind the Sun.

The movie never makes the mistake of taking itself seriously. It's drenched in pop-culture references, most of them American (how can you not love a movie that shows commercials for the Bruce Campbell Right Hand 2 chainsaw?), and off-kilter homages to other zombie movies. But again, the difference between a no-account Z movie like this in Japan and one in America is almost shocking. These are (for the most part) at least competent actors, and they're playing a good script; Eiko and Shibukawa's story is a little out there at times, but it works on some fundamental level. Compare this to American direct-to-video (and some theatrical) low-budget horror flicks (and some major ones; The Haunting, anyone?), and the difference is immediately obvious.

Not the greatest, but an amusing way to kill an hour and a half. ** ",1173744000,3,2571,4.794582392776523
1880832,5,B000096IAM,"My feeling is that the people who rate this movie poorly most likely had their expectations so firmly set about what kind of film to expect that they can't judge it on its own merits.  I think that if you understand this film, you can't help but love it (unless you totally hate J-schlock wholesale, in which case, why are you watching it?).

This film is schlock genius, and one of my favorite films.

If you come to it with an open mind, and an appreciation for this style of filmmaking, I think you'll find this film to be quite wonderful.

Stacy presents a Zombie love story that is seriously charming, yet at the same time bizarre and disturbing.  Above all else, this film is a love story.  That one of the lovers happens to be a Zombie doesn't change this fact.  Sure, the horror aspects are bizarre and violent enough for schlock horror fans to enjoy, but that's not the point.  This is a sweet and somewhat wry allegory for the creators' take on the Japanese social dilemmas involving love.  It's not a broad Zombie comedy like ""Shaun of the Dead,"" nor a straight-up horror flick either.  It's something entirely different, and possibly unprecedented.

This director, and his cast (especially the Japanese Vincent Price analogue) should make more films.",1171065600,3,1262,4.6909090909090905
1880833,1,B000096IAM,"I am an avid horror movie fan.  I also love dark comedies and this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen.  Each copy of this movie should be burned in a fire before it's mindnumbing LACK of plot, acting talent, and gore spread to more movie fans.  In theory the story itself sounds extremely promising, however this is a movie that i could not turn away from while watching because i just kept assuming, ""it has to get better at some point right?"".  Wrong.  The acting is absolutely horrendous.  The gore is really not nearly as gorey as others on here would lead you to believe.  And the general underlying premise of love in the story is far too care bear and cotton candy campy for any actual person to believe.  If you have any theatre background or appreciation of fine arts at all, watching this movie all the way through will only prove that you have masocistic tendencies towards your own intelligence.

1880834,2,B000096IAM,"Wearing its influences on its sleeve--or, more accurately, its right hand--STACY is steeped in zombie tradition.  When girls turn fifteen, their days are numbered.  They'll soon die and become resurrected as zombies known as ""Stacy's.""  These deadly, albeit cute, creatures of the undead are dispatched by the brave men of the Romero Squads (whose recruiting commercials tout, ""Kill your own daughters!"").

  In STACY we follow Eiko (Natsuki Kato), a lass experiencing the last euphoric days before death with Shibukawa (Toshinori Omi), a hapless puppeteer who has agreed to ""multiple kill"" her upon her inopportune return.  The audience is also made privy to the less-than-ethical experiments of zombologist Dr. Inugami Sukekiyo (Yasutaka Tsutsui) who has determined through endless study that Stacy's continue to twitch until they've been cut up into 165 distinct bits.

While STACY may have a good sense of humour (like the Bruce Campbell Model chainsaws), the action scenes feel forced and the zombies are less than frightening as they shamble around in their schoolgirl uniforms",1149120000,3,1083,5.4431137724550895

Yeah, the visual effects aren't multimillion budget quality. In my opinion, the B-Movie gore effects are what made the movie a classic. The only thing I found displeasing in Stacy was the awkward thing they did with their tounges after they return from the dead. Some might not like the way the undead school girls walk, which is much rather twitching than walking, but I personally found it to be far more creepy that way.

box:  ""WARNING!  This film contains scenes with

chainsaws, graphic gore, extreme violence and girls in

bunny outfits.""  In the tongue-in-cheek zombie genre',

1880839,4,B000096IAM,"On a purely gut level, ""Stacy"" sounds like a great movie. An extremely low budget film that looks like director Naoyuki Tomomatsu shot on video, the movie consists of a bunch of young Japanese schoolgirls turned into ravenous zombies running around tearing people to shreds. That one line alone ought to inspire the avid horror fan to run, not walk, to the nearest DVD dispersal point for a copy. Another selling point for the film, in my eyes, is the fact that Synapse films performed the transfer to DVD. This company is a true hero for the horror fan, releasing obscure film after obscure film from around the world for our viewing pleasure. I recently read an article concerning the DVD release of ""The Deadly Spawn"" that claimed Synapse spent more money on the restoration than the filmmakers did on the entire movie! And we're not talking pocket change, either. That's what I call dedication. A final reason to pick up this film, if the above two reasons don't do the trick, is the superiority of this shot on video production compared to the dreck spooned out over here by companies like Sub Rosa. It is obvious Tomomatsu has enough talent to move on to film, something I can't say for the directors of ""Shatter Dead"" and ""Peter Rottentail.""

Something sinister on a global scale is occurring in the film ""Stacy."" Some malady--whether biological, chemical, or psychological no one knows as of yet--is causing pre-teen girls everywhere to perish suddenly. As bad as that sounds, what happens afterwards is a real nightmare: the girls emerge from their tombs as mindless flesheating zombies willing to prey on family members, friends, and total strangers. At some point, a talking head attached the moniker ""Stacy"" to these hapless victims, a name that stuck and now applies to zombies in every country. The implications of such a catastrophe should be very clear: without these girls growing up to bear children, the human population will move rapidly towards extinction in the coming years. In the meantime, the authorities take all manner of precautions to stem the tide of Stacy related disasters. Governments urge parents to look for the warning signs, including bouts of giggling immediately preceding demise called NDH (Near Death Happiness), and prepare to do the unthinkable. Armed with ""Bruce Campbell"" chainsaws purchased through companies advertising on television along with a ready supply of government provided trash bags, mother and father must be willing to dispose of their out of control daughters before the child hurts anyone else. Just in case a few milquetoasts can't fire up the old chainsaw when the moment arrives, Romero Repeat Kill soldiers move in too clean up the mess.

None of the above takes center stage in ""Stacy,"" however. We do get to see a few of the messier scenes involving Romero troops and a rampaging Stacy, and we do see a few of the advertisements on television for the Campbell chainsaws (you can wear them on one hand!), but other issues move to the forefront. Specifically, the movie follows the relationship between a puppet designer and a soon to be Stacy. Director Tomomatsu spends a huge amount of time following this budding relationship between an older man and a younger girl. They go out for walks in a garden, engage in long, meaningful talks, and the puppeteer even stages a show for his new girlfriend. It's disconcerting in the extreme for American horror film fans to watch what is essentially a romance movie taking place in the middle of gory carnage. It's all apparently related to the overarching theme Tomomatsu is trying to get across to his audience, about the social position of young girls in Japan in relation to male domination and expectations. Or something along those lines. Whatever it is, ""Stacy"" sure is a strange, schizophrenic film. Imagine ""The Professional"" fused with a George Romero gutmuncher.

The horror fan in me wants to reject the social messages of this film--messages I had to read about in the liner notes because I haven't a clue as to how Japanese society works--and focus instead on the extreme gore. And there is a lot of gluey stuff going on, especially during the final scenes when a doctor working on the causes of the Stacy phenomenon loses control of his test subjects. For such a low budget production the gore effects look quite remarkable. Regrettably, the bloody effects work will only take you so far. The rest of the trip consists of the romance angle and cornball antics so inane that will take your breath away. What was up with the girls that formed the underground Romero type group? That they offer to help squeamish parents kill their Stacies is all fine and dandy, since a law requires parents to dispatch their own troublesome female offspring leaves the faint of heart in a quandary, but to name their group after Drew Barrymore? What's next, the Christina Aguilera Attack Squad? The Britney Spears Revolutionary Army? Egad! Too, that constant NDH giggling is likely to work your last nerve to a frazzle long before the movie grinds to a halt.

I can't find it in myself to take ""Stacy"" out behind the woodshed because of its problems, however. The movie is such an inventive twist on an old horror idea that I generally enjoyed it despite the often impenetrable plot. As for the DVD itself, the picture quality looks fantastic for a shot on video project. Synapse throws in a trailer as an extra, but nothing else. I heard Tomomatsu is in Japan making another zombie film as I write, so perhaps we can expect another weird take on the zombie theme in the future. Give ""Stacy"" a watch if you like a movie that mystifies as much as it churns the stomach.",1103760000,11,5675,4.8353909465020575
1880840,3,B000096IAM,"""Stacy"" is a movie that few people who watch it seem to really ""get,"" and I can hardly hold that against them. It does hold a very interesting concept underneath its mindless gore and bizarre characters.

A strange phenomenon is causing girls age 15-17 all over the world to die and come back as flesh eating zombies. Before they die, they are overcome by something called NDH (Near Death Happiness) which causes them to run around acting giddy and lovestruck, and giggling with delight at everything they see. After they die, their friends and family members are asked to chop them up into little pieces before they are brought back to life as something called a ""Stacy.""

I'm not a great fan of Zombie horror. However, I can appreciate this as a new take on the whole thing. The zombie gore is fun, if you're into that sort of thing. But what made this movie so interesting to me was the whole reason why the teen girls became zombies, and that's that part that's easy to miss. Near the end, the mad doctor studying the ""Stacies"" says, ""I finally know what brings you to life. It's love."" If it sounds like I ruined the ending for you, I haven't. This seems like a big explanatory scene near the end of a horror film, except that it makes no sense whatsoever. But as you may know (and you probably do, if you looked up this title), Asian horror doesn't usually have an explanation for everything the way American horror does. And Stacy is no exception. There's much more to it than just that.

The image of a young woman in a school uniform represents an idealized image of female sexuality that doesn't exist. The disease these girls suffer from is caused by (male) society's obsession with a feminine ideal. When the girls first become infected, they act like mindless bimbos, giggling and professing their love for any man who walks toward them. This goes on for a while, until this cultural stereotype kills them, and they are reborn, transformed from nearly mindless bimbos into literally mindless zombies. As it is stated over and over again in the film, the girls have a natural desire to be loved. As if forced by evolution, the girls move toward the mindless state that will allow them to be loved. In short, this film is a metaphor for idealized images of submissive women, and how dangerous those images can be to girls.

Having said all that, this movie is incredibly goofy. I wouldn't blame you if you watched this and failed to see the depth I just described. But that's what I came away with. There are some fun zombie scenes, and the unusual premise makes for some wacky characters. By far my favorite were the three teenage girls who formed an illegal ""repeat kill"" agency they named after their idol, Drew Barrymore. They contact families who can't bring themselves to chop up their dead daughters, and do it themselves, for a fee. Their goal is to save enough money to pay their favorite star to ""repeat kill"" them after they die. The girls want to die by the hand of someone they love. When one of them giggles, someone makes a remark to her about ""NDH,"" and she gets very defensive and belligerent. I interpret this, not so much as a fear of dying, but a defiance of what is happening to her. Despite the fact that this comes from a desire to be ""loved,"" she does not want to become what a male dominated society wants her to be. NDH may be a certain ""happiness,"" but she would rather live as a real person with real feelings and ideas. And since she can't, she wishes to be repeat killed, instead of living in a mindless state.

I quite liked this film, although I can't give it a very high rating, because sometimes it just gets way too silly. The ""I think I'm at my prettiest"" speech just makes you go, ""huh?"" All in all, this is much better than average cheap, gross out special effects zombie movies. If you're one of those zombie purists who hates zombie movies that don't stick to the arbitrary zombie movie rules, stay away. But if you want a low budget movie with something different, I'd recommend it, because horror movies don't get much more different than this.",1100304000,18,4097,4.531081081081081
1880841,5,B000096IAM,"Stacy: Attack Of The Schoolgirl Zombies

directed by Naoyuki Tomomatsu

2001, 80 mins.

Stacy is a movie about, you guessed it, Stacy. Or well, Stacies, actually. Teenage girls, aged 15-17, somehow just die after experiencing some kind of Near Death Happiness. After dying, they turn into, yup, zombies. (the title didn't really give that one away, did it?) They demand to be chopped up into 165 pieces to be 're-killed'. This is what the 'story' revolves around, although the story is not really of any importance, or so it seems.

We see a girl who (unconvincingly) experiences the earlier mentioned Near Death Happiness and then goes on the look for someone to chop her up when she dies and turns into a zombie (uh). She finds a puppet-maker, Shibu, who agrees to kill her. Another (sub?)plot revolves around a guy whose sister has become a Stacy (he had to kill her after that) and therefore joins Romero, the special unit that kills the Stacies. It's quite confusing, and too pretentious by far, but besides all that, the movie provides a whole lot of fun. Tongue-in-cheek scenes (one involving some kind of TelSell advertisement where a 'Blues Campbell's Right Hand #2' is sold) help to keep your attention to it.

The movie isn't really scary (read: not at all), but the gore and fun make up for it. A strong stomach is advised for some scenes, such as the one where a Stacy gets decapitated, and some others where people get devoured quite gruesomely (guts ripped out and such). Watch it if you like zombies, Japanese schoolgirls, or both.

1880842,4,B000096IAM,"There is a whole lotta love in ""Stacy.""  It oozes from every open wound,  gushes with every decapitated head, and every chainsaw bite is a kiss.  You just know that all the people involved in making this B-Grade schoolgirl zombie flick, from the special effects gang to the director to the screaming ravenous schoolgirls, are fans first and film professionals second, if at all.  After all, with ""Romero Repeat Kill Squads"" running around armed with ""Bruce Campbell's Right Hand #2"" chainsaws, it is pretty easy to see the influences.

Unfortunately, while a film made by a bunch of fans has its charms, the quality isn't really up to snuff in most areas.  Chainsaws rip through puppets with all the realism of an episode of ""South Park.""  It looks to have been shot on digital video rather than film, which doesn't help the amateur look.  The acting, with a few exceptions such as the lovely Natsuki Kato as Eiko, is pretty much what you would expect.

If you can forgive all that, however, ""Stacy"" is a surprisingly charming and incredibly quirky love story mixed into a messy zombie flick.  Much like Miike Takeshi's ""Happiness of the Katakuris,"" which is also a zombie film, director Naoyuki Tomomatsu combined innocence and sweetness with splatter-horror in a winsome combination.  There is a perverse sensibility in the story of all girls dying by age 17, after which they are reanimated as flesh-eating monsters.  Like Peter Pan, these girls never have to age, never have to grow up.  Of course, they are chainsawed into 165 pieces rather than fly around Neverland.  But like all such stories, in the end, love conquers all.

This is definitely not a film for hard-core zombie buffs, who are looking for some cruel carnage or nudity (of which there is none.)  However, anyone who can appreciate something with this much love in it, both in the making and the story, will come away with a whole unexpected and sweet ending.",1097971200,2,1929,4.817629179331307
1880843,2,B000096IAM,"There's plenty.  However don't try to make much sense of the story.  Like a lot of Japanese horror films it goes off on a weird nonsensical tangent towards the end and I found myself saying over and over again ""It's not over yet? It's not over yet?"" as I fast forwarded through it.  Outside of the buckets and buckets of dismembered body parts, zombies chomping on intestines and a mad scientist's experiments the film, whose last half resembles Day of the Dead, isn't really that good.  What promises to be a fun, roller coaster ride of a horror film falls flat on its face focusing on one guy's quest to find his zombie girlfriend and another guy's last days with his soon-to-be zombie girlfriend who has possibly the most annoying laugh ever.  Not to mention the irritating, glass bell she carries everywhere she goes. Also, the soundtrack is so inappropriately corny that it detracts from the movie.  Instead of some eerie atmospheric music, we get cheesy soft jazz.  Whatever! Fast forward to the gory scenes but nevermind the story, it's really not worth the effort.",1095897600,,1072,4.762162162162162
1880844,5,B000096IAM,"Well... being a fan of Zombie flicks, this looked like fun. And... as much as I would like to sit here and pick out the positives & negatives in this flick, like I'm some uber-cool B-Flick Aficionado, I must confess, ""Stacy"" had me slack-jawed & stunned, complete with sights of cartoon question-marks and explanation-points flashing above my head. This is not the goriest movie I have ever seen, nor the sickest, nor the cheesiest. However, this is probably one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen in my life.
I'm writing this immediately after checking out the flick, without doing any research in re who wrote it, who directed it, etc; which is fun, because it leaves me here, typing & wondering with astonishment, WHO THOUGHT UP THIS STORY, AND WHAT DREAM OR HALLUCINATION DID THEY JUST WAKE UP FROM?
The plot involves an epidemic of NDH: Near Death Happiness, afflicting girls between the ages of 15-17. The NDH-stricken girls go through approximately one week of sheer emotional bliss, elated yet fully aware of what's going on. After the elation phase, they drop dead, then become reanimated, devouring any human within their grasp. Unable to find a cure for the reanimated schoolgirls, which become nicknamed ""Stacys,"" the government has produced ""Romero Squads,"" (Too cool! For those of you who have delved into Zombie movies, The Romero Squads are a tribute to ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" creator George Romero) who are responsible for the ""Rekill,"" the offing of the dead girl brought back to life.
It gets weird...even considering it's a flick about hungry walking dead folk. Rather than mass despair and suicides by adolescent girls fearing of NDH infection, the girls dream about the knight-in-shining-armour, the sweetheart who will love them, and then valiantly rekill them, once their corpses rise to nibble on the living! See, in this story, aside from Romero Squad members, the only folk allowed to rekill a Stacy are family members or boyfriends.
Which brings us to the black-market Stacy killers, comprised of three stunningly beautiful warrior-girls in the NDH age range, resigned to becoming Stacys one of these days, but idealistic on who will rekill them. They illegally rekill Stacys, hired by Stacy family members who can't find it in them to slaughter their dead loved-ones. The girls are saving their bounty profits to hire a specific dream-boy to rekill them, a sexy young pop-star they are ga-ga over.
This is one original living dead flick that I highly recommend. I've seen bloodier, I've seen higher-budget, but I can't recall seeing one this weird. Despite the storyline of gorgeous schoolgirls, the focus is not on the kinky, but on schoolgirl crushes, true love, and bizarre sentimental twists from start to finish. There are many living-dead films that spotlight the gory (1980's Zombie, various other Euro-Zombie flicks), others that spotlight the campiness (Return of the Living Dead series), and those that run on the suspense and terror (the original ""Night of the Living Dead""). This flick combines all three: blood & body parts flying right and left, B-Star Bruce Campbell hawking his own brand of chainsaw on infomercials, and the public despairing over the only grim solutions to the Stacy epidemic. Give this DVD a try, it's worth the time and dough!",1088380800,10,3327,5.007220216606498

1880846,4,B000096IAM,"On the surface, Stacy is low-budget schlock, a film that is decidedly amateurish in many aspects.  Shot on digital video on a very tight budget it has nevertheless many charms, it's a film where you can tell that the filmmakers had lots of talent and lots of really cool ideas.  But oh, that budget...If you can get past the cheapness of it all, devouted fans of Asian horror will love this apocalyptic zombie tale that pays homage to past classic films of the undead.
In the beginning of the 21st century girls aged 15-17 began to die and spring back to life as zombies.  People coined the term ""Stacy"" for them.  Stacies are obviously very dangerous and must be killed but one has to abide by the ""Stacies law"" which says that only boyfriends and family members can kill a Stacy.  If Stacies go astray and can't be killed by the ones they love then the job belongs to the Romero Repeat Kill troup, who use chainsaws called the ""Bruce Campbell right hand #2"" to kill the stacies.  To properly kill a Stacy, it must be decapitated into 165 pieces.
One thing I particularly enjoyed was the explanations behind the Stacy phenomenon.  The film goes into substantial length to describe the cause and aftereffects through a narrator, various news reports and scientific explanations from a doctor who studies the Stacies.  I must say I prefer this approach (as used in the classic vamp novel ""I am legend"") compared to Zombie films that just throw you into a decayed world without bothering to explain how it got to be that way in the first place.  As for the gore, people who choose to view the film simply for this reason will certainly not be disappointed, we're talking no-holds barred mondo splatter here.  Again, the budget kind of hinders the quality of the gore in the first place but nevertheless there's something very disturbing about watching cute little Japanese girls in school outfits getting hacked to 165 bloody pieces with a chainsaw.
Stacy is quirky, funny and very bizarre.  It contains a number of inventive concepts that a highly seasoned zombie film watcher as myself had never seen before.  But when all is said and done, in the end ""Stacy"" is not about zombies, or gore, or even horror.  It's a story about love.  I know that might be hard to believe but the centerpiece of the story is about a guy and his girlfriend who is about to turn into a Stacy and the emotional pain that this realization does to both of them.  The story is filled with heartfelt human tragedy and philosophies about love that are genuinely touching, although not everyone is going to understand this; Stacy is the epitomy of quirky, offbeat Japanese humour that novice viewers of Asian films might have troubling appreciating but I loved it.",1086912000,8,2737,4.672916666666667

From what I understand the movie ""Stacy"" has nothing to do with the book on which it is based except that girls are dying and returning from the dead to consume human flesh.  Go ahead and lay down some bucks for this film and try to be open minded while watching it.  Hey, its better than that crap from French film maker Jean Rollin.",1076976000,5,642,4.264462809917355

This movie does have a lot of gore.  Pretty good gore, too.  But it is all just background.  The Bruce Campbell brand chain saw might seem a little cheesy, but it just adds to the nice atmosphere of the movie.

This hyperinventive spin on the zombie film is one of the most unique I've ever seen. I'd definitely put it on the Required Viewing for Zombie Fans list and in the Top [Random Number] Zombie movies list, as well as the Most [Powerful Adjective Here] Zombie list. In the frighteningly near future, girls from the ages of 15 to 17 become euphoric, die and come back from the dead as flesheaters, each dubbed a ""Stacy"". Besides the obvious threat to mankind (getting eaten), there is also the threat of death by attrition with a downward spiraling birth rate thanks to the unfortunate reduction in the numbers of grown women to marry and multiply. Problems abound. This Japanese film tackles this already original take on zombie flicks with a layered story. A keep-to-himself young artist and puppeteer is approached by a Stacy with a simultaneously romantic and horrifying request. Government sanctioned Repeat Kill Troops roam the area, taking out Stacys in violent fashion; ""repeat kill"" refers to the fact that killing a zombie means that, um, person has died twice. Once naturally, then again when the zombiefied self is destroyed by the government's Romero Repeat Kill Troops. Or by illegal repeat killers, such as a trio of pre NDH (near death happiness) teen girls who offer their services at a price when the sanctioned troops aren't to be found. And they have a startling reason for the money they're squirreling away, but it makes sense once you get left field drilled by it. And speaking of all this destroying, there's the mad scientist guy, though he's ostensibly an official scientist, who has discovered that the means of destroying the Stacys is to hack them up into 165 pieces. There's a lot going on here, both in terms of script and style. Stacy is a bloody and balls to the wall gore film as well as a horror-comedy. You can't throw a zombie without hitting some satire or philosophical musings. The concept of STACY, when finally and fully unfurled, is pretty bold, but if you have an open mind, you may find that this is among the most inspirational (not Jesusy or anything) zombie films you'll ever see. The ending, which caps everything, from story to ideas, is stunning and an ubersatisfying conclusion to an eclectic modern zombie classic, chock full of brains, in more ways than one.

As the Romero Repeat Kill Troops set out to destroy the threat, a crazed scientist works to unlock the secret that is causing this deadly phenomenon. Any subtext about teen fetishism and innocence lost that STACY might present is marred by this awful mess of a production. Though billed as a Horror Comedy, STACY is mostly unfunny, and it suffers from terrible acting, ugly cinematography, and a painfully slow pace. There are only a few distanced moments of bloody mayhem that are worth watching for, along with the typical fanboy references to THE EVIL DEAD and George Romero. Naoyuki Tomomatsu is simply unable to translate the intelligence of Kenji Otsuki's original novel in a meaningful way, leaving most zombie fans either confused or uninterested. The over-the-top gore and camp ridiculousness that does make it into STACY would lead the way for better films like THE MACHINE GIRL, TOKYO GORE POLICE, and ROBOGEISHA later in the decade.

7989997,5,B000096IAM,"""Stacy"" is from Japanese Words ""Sute Isi"" which means a ""Stepping Stone"".
 This movie (or the original novel written by Kenji Otsuki) is a metaphor.
 You know, in the 80's in Japan, there was a boom called 'the Band Boom.'
 There were many Rock'n'roll, Soul, Pop Bands of various styles.
 And After the fever gone, Japanese music scene went an unified, boring stage.

 In this movie, at the begining, the zombies terrified the whole world.
 But in the end, people leaned how to tame them.
 Kenji Otsuki was once a Rock'n'roll (or Heavy Metal) icon and had a very
big time and then he got losed. In other words, the 80's bands including
his band 'Kinniku shoujo tai' got overwhelmed by the commercialism of
Japanese music industrials.
 Thru' this experience he wrote this novel.
 He felt that his band and other bands were merely the stepping stones
('Sute Ishi' or 'Stacy') during the evolution (or degeneration) of Japanese music scene.

 So if u know the background like this, u'll find this movie is rather
cynical or critical metaphor and u'll find this movie more enjoyable!",1237248000,,1079,4.772972972972973

7990000,4,B000096IAM,"What a bizarre movie! While it has a lot of the ""zombie movie"" mainstays, it's oddly unique.

1) ACTING--while the acting wasn't incredible, it was passable. A few of the performances seemed forced, but the leads were okay.

2) ZOMBIES--the zombies are the typical ""romero shamblers."" The make up for the zombies was minimal, possible so the viewer could still see that ""schoolgirls"" were killing and eating people.

3) SPECIAL EFFECTS--WOW! The majority of the budget must have been spent of the blood and gore in this movie! The blood flows free in this one, and the gore is wonderfully over the top!

4) HOMAGES--the people behind this movie obviously love zombie movies and people like George Romero and Bruce Campbell. There are so many references to them in this movie, it almost becomes a game to try and figure out where some of the references are from!

Overall, not a bad movie. It's a fun little romp into zombieland, albeit a little strange and confusing.

Lots of gore. It reminded me of Re-animator at times, Japanese style. Maybe if it was made on a more serious note rather than such a campy style, it might make a good movie.

The fact that it was shot on tape didn't help it one bit either. I hate that.

And the theme... something must have definitely been lost in translation because I did not understand the point of this movie at all.
