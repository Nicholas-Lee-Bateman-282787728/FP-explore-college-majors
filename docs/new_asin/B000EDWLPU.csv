2516715,5,B000EDWLPU,"Don't listen to other reviews if you are a true movie buff.  There can be many positive and heart-felt words to define this movie, but the one that stands out the most is: ""Professional"".  Forgive the slight overuse of the word ""professional"" in this review as I am merely attempting to reflect the theme of professionalism in my review as is represented in the movie.

The ripple effect this movie has had on the movie industry marks the rationale behind the Pacific Ocean having waves that don't stop.  The realistic choreography, unfathomable depths of interpretation, adversaries in action, reveling romance, deep and intimate character development, and the irrefutable facts of this movie will not leave you disappointed, unfulfilled, or empty.

The choreography in this movie is grade A perfect.  It is not over the top and is about as realistic as you can get.  I interviewed a third degree black belt in Muay Thai, and he told me that all of the fighting most certainly didn't use any stunt doubles because the actors were skilled enough to do it themselves.  This movie literally inspired him to start his own dojo in the bustling and crime-ridden metropolis of Pine Village, Indiana.  These days in Hollywood, coming across actors fully willing and able both to act and do their own stunts is about as rare as a vegetarian Burmese python.  We haven't seen that type of acting coupled with stunts since Jackie Chan.

When I did my dissertation on the psychology over assassins having dinner, I was pleased to find out how so many assassins don't actually eat dinner.  That phenomena adds a deeper layer of interpretation to this movie that otherwise doesn't normally exist.  A professional assassin simply will not eat dinner much like how a musk ox will not eat a 4 ton casting of ceramic steel.  Just the title of this movie alone captivates the viewer because assassins don't have dinners.  Questions from this title will flood the plane of your mind such as, ""Who is having dinner with an assassin?  Why is an assassin having dinner?  When did assassins start eating dinner?  What is an assassin?""  This mysterious fog of intrigue and enigma encompasses the dinner, which engulfs the already cloudy and nebulous protagonist that is the assassin: these two elements combined creates an illusion that draws the viewer into the movie and creating an awestruck wonderment of how these two paradoxical concepts can intertwine in the plot that never stops unfolding even after the denouement.  Fascinating!  It's like a fractal that actually starts and ends yet like a fractal, the layers are infinitely deep, twisted, and engaging.  Even the art on the cover reveals little yet so much simultaneously.  The assassin wears sunglasses to hide the window to his soul.  All professional assassins wear sunglasses.  Only the exceedingly professional assassins wear mirrored sunglasses.  Not only do these shades hide the eyes, they reflect back on two separate scenes--a dinner table and an assassination.  The artwork is even self-revealing and analogously parallels what the title implies.  No movie in the history of Hollywood has ever put forth so much effort as to link the plot, characterization, and all this movie represents in the artwork and title.

Note the frequency of references to food, dining, and particularly etiquette throughout this movie.  The etiquette is yet another profound and recurring theme in this groundbreaking movie.  Foiling the etiquette used at dinner and the ""professional"" etiquette used during assassinations is mind-blowing--the two cross the streams and create an explosion, which casts the audience into a parallel universe of sensational viewing pleasure and elation.  Not only do we see this skillfully diverse assassin use a fork and spoon correctly and drink his wine properly, we see professional courtesy portrayed frequently between the antagonists and protagonist during various assassinations, plots, and encounters.  It's a delightfully professional and prim-and-proper movie.  At the same time, it does not detract from the action.  I actually had to go to the hospital at one point because I was so far off the edge of my seat that I fell due to gripped viewing pleasure.  Falling off the seat isn't so bad, right?  It is when your seat is 200 feet in the air due to the roller coaster of unbridled, non-stop, perpetual excitement this movie delivers.  The action and thrill of this movie is never ending and will leave you needing a blood pressure prescription.  Let's compare this movie to canines.  If a standard Michael Bay film is a quadriplegic, toothless puppy, then this dog of a movie is a steroid-infused allosaurus hopped up on PCP and cocaine.  I have never seen so much blood, gore, and gibs in a single movie that is so tastefully and professionally done.

How can there be so much violence and action such that it is actually tastefully done?  Tasteful is exactly what anybody wants at the dinner scene.  Tasteful is accomplished in this brilliant film through the light opaque romantic strokes on this canvas of bloodied assassination-tainted action.  The balance of romance outweighs the meaty corpses left behind in a wake of destruction.  This movie has enough romance in it to draw your significant other into it.  Jennifer Brown puts all of the stereotypical lead actresses to shame.  Aniston?  ""Rumor Has It"" that she didn't stand a chance compared to this Jennifer's performance.  Barrymore?  She'd have to go on at least a hundred more first dates to live up to the Brown's hard-to-get personality and comedic charm.  Bullock made the biggest mistake in her career when she turned down the lead role.  Hope actually does float for Brown in her blossoming career.  None of these other actresses would even come close to performing the role she has in this movie.  The deliveries from Brown were so heart-felt and emotionally strong that I yet again had to make a trip to the hospital because I was so dehydrated from crying.  I cried more tears than the actual Titanic took on water.  The movie doesn't just end with the romance though.

The characters actually develop a bond not only for one another on-screen, but you become a part of the characters too as you become emotionally tied to their fates, choices, and dialogue.  It has the embarrassingly powerful grip of a soap opera but the best elements of an action and romantic comedy at the same time.  It's a movie you'll be longing to watch time and time again until the sequel is released.  I actually created my own bobble-head dolls of Floyd, Kane, and Shaunda so I can think about the movie en route to work, McDonald's, or the local Muy Thai dojo.  I even re-enact scenes with my dolls during work, lunch, at home, and most importantly during dinner.  My wife and I even act out the roles and if it doesn't end with hysterical laughter or rekindling our romantic spark for one another, we almost certainly end up joyously attempting an assassination on a neighbor.  We never follow through with it for obvious reasons, but the neighbors know us as this point, which adds to the fun factor of re-living the movie in reality.  We all laugh about it, and they now do the same thing to us.  The movie not only helps out marriages but extends to entire communities.  Owning and re-enacting this movie is actually #8 on our HOA policies required for people moving into our neighborhood.  We've actually become the living embodiment of this movie's full cast and characters.

Lastly, this movie yet again astonishes the world on a completely unexpected front: this movie is a biographical documentary and historically accurate movie based solely on the first-hand details out of Floyd's life journal.  From the actual log entries of a real life assassin, Fogaro transformed the writings into an actual living and breathing movie with the largest fan base ever recorded.

I can't describe how great this must-see professionally done movie is.  Everything about the realistic fighting down to the indie film industry with deep liturgical interpretations and themes back up to violent action then swinging back down into romance only to make you fall in love with characters where you eventually find out that it's all based on a true story will make you re-think your current existence after watching this masterpiece.  Wow!!  Some of these elements from current blockbuster hits relied on the cornerstone of this movie for their own success.  Skyfall is just one example.  James Bond uses a gun in Skyfall.  Floyd uses a gun in Dinner with an Assassin.  The difference?  Floyd used it first.  Watch this movie, and you will not be disappointed.",1390521600,8,8677,4.958419958419959
2516716,3,B000EDWLPU,"My roommate rented this film from the library on a military base and I watched it with him. It has everything that makes great camp; bad acting, a plot that resembles a pasta strainer, juvenile dialogue, and audio/visual effects that simply bogle the mind. It would be absurd to take this movie seriously. It's only redeeming value is that it's hilariously bad. My roomate and I couldn't help laughing at this piece. Frankly, for $.95 used, I recommend having a beer and giving it a watch.",1190678400,3,489,4.6976744186046515
2516717,1,B000EDWLPU,"No kidding--The worst piece of garbage I've ever seen!!!

Don't be fooled by the dvd cover like I was. It looked like the film was written, produced, and directed by a bunch of 6th graders-and the acting was even worse. Unrealistic plot and storyline that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone actually was able to pitch this nonsense and get financial backing. Looks like someone picked up a camcorder, grabbed some people off the street, and decided to make up the script as they went along. To the guy who gave this movie 5 stars--you should be ashamed. You must be the either filmaker or a realtive, because you know this movie sucked!",1176940800,4,660,4.641025641025641

2516745,2,B000EDWLPU,Definitely indie film that could have been real good had the execution been better. Kept watching hoping for more but it didn't happen. Just because you have a low budget doesn't mean you can't make great art. Whomever directed this needs to truly analyze why Spike Lee with little funds was able to make his first films. I would suggest they redo it.,1437868800,,351,4.587301587301587
