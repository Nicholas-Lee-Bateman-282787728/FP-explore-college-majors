2321807,3,B0009UC7KM,"My boyfriend is a big fan of Cheech and Chong whereas I have only heard of them and am not familiar with their movies.  When I did a search on Amazon I found this ""Greatest Hits"" pack and thought it was a great deal.  However, we have yet to watch ""Still Smoking"" all the way though despite several attempts.  I believe that this 2-pak is a way to sell the bad movie with a great one.  My advise is know what you are purchasing before you wind up disappointed like us.",1167868800,13,468,4.1098901098901095
2321808,4,B0009UC7KM,"I enjoyed this DVD collection because i only have the VHS of these 2 movies and since they're on DVD this rocks! i don't care wat u say,Cheech And Chong made a good idea into a great 1 and Up In Smoke is the BEST movie they ever did!",1133049600,8,233,3.7755102040816326
2321809,2,B0009UC7KM,"What's the point of this. They could have released all the movies including the rarer ""Get Out of My Room"" in one set. They instead pick the classic ""Up in Smoke"" which has already got a lot of extras, and probably their worst movie (debatable with ""Corsican Brothers"") and certainly least funny. That DVD had no extras, and there isn't any extras advertised on the front, so I'm asuming there aren't any. This also leaves the door open to more sets, possibly a ""Nice Dreams"" and ""Next Movie"" combo, which we don't need either. The ""Up in Smoke"" movie raises it to 2 stars which is as high as it will go.",1121558400,6,604,4.401785714285714
2321810,1,B0009UC7KM,"Ey, Chico.

Like, Ummm... Cheech & Chong is da bomb, ok, essay.. but like a DVD will hold 4 hours of good quality sheet, bro.... so like, instead of them releasing it as like a double thing in a box set wiff 2 DVD's... they should like put the bong down long enough to like put both movies in the one disc, man.

Like Up In Smoke does have like bonus stuff and a audio commentary, but it's cool man, both movies the like fit nicely, and the bonus would too, you know.. so like, ummm... I think it's cheaper to like buy them both seperate anyway, but like, if you don't have them both already, then like this might be like a 5 star buy, you know.

Man, they need to put some thought into what there doing man, whatever they smokin' at Paramount is bad sheet, man... maybe I could like drop by and see them and explain why they should put both movies on one disc, or even a flip disc or something, then introduce them to my cousin who like can set them up with some good sheet, man. Then maybe they start doing something productive instead of re-issuing da left overs, man.

Gotta go chase some fi-fi now, adios amigos, toke to you later, man.",1119744000,8,1141,4.172727272727273

2321978,4,B0009UC7KM,"Two lovable stoners Cheech and Chong, smuggling a van made of pot from Mexico to L.A.  Can it get any better.  I know the lines like so many but we still love to hear them.

Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong are fun, laid back and stoned.  They are so funny and sarcastic at times that many can see some of the friends of their past in these two crazy characters.

I've never smoked pot; not into it; but you dont' have to be to love this film.  Whenever I take life too seriously, this is one that I pop in the DVD player.

Still Smokin is very good; not as good as Up in Smoke but still beyond funny.  Still Smokin has our 2 heroes going to a celebrity festival in Amsterdam of all places, but the guy that invited them took off with all the money so their budget is limited let's say.  Cheech and Chong then help with the festivities in a way that only they can.

If you need a laugh, this is a must see.  This is definitely not a movie to pop in on family night with the kiddies after the Little Mermaid, but adults will laugh out loud and remember a time when for many in the 70's, life was up in smoke.",1334448000,,1103,3.990867579908676

2322006,5,B0009UC7KM,The two movies should be doubled up on a blu ray release. It would be about time for that I would say. The first is a real classic and the second lays down more funny stuff to enjoy.

2322009,5,B0009UC7KM,"All I got to say is, ""Good Movies"" and ""Funny"" ""So When are they gonna make pot legal already?"" I guess they aint done making money with lawyers and court cost. Thats probably the only way a greedy government like ours can make any money off it. Thats because its too easy to grow. If it were legal millions of people would probably grow it themselves. And I know from expierence that its a far better high than drinking booze or beer. Ive seen people get violent while drinking. But I never seen a stoner get violent while stoned. Maybe alot of people would be more relaxed if it were really legal? Not to mention there might be less violent crimes in the U.S. So why don't they just let us have it already? It really calms people down. Not to mention there might be less casualties due to D.W.I.'s. Anyway, I know from expierence that Its far better on the body than drinking is. Probably because your more relaxed when your stoned. But booze makes more money so its legal. All I got to say is they should get there priorities straight. And leave us potheads alone. Its ironic how this is suppose to be a free country. But your not free to smoke grass. (Just ask Tommy Chong.) All because of greedy polititions. Just go figure.",1268524800,2,1229,4.394736842105263

2322012,4,B0009UC7KM,For those days you feel like suspending reality and getting many a laugh (if you allow yourself to laugh) this is great. I am a long time fan (since LP record days) and C & C never fail to make me relax. Matter of fact my 32 year old son and I both get a kick out of sitting down once in a while and laughing at their antics and jokes. They have bridged the generation gap. A 1960's hippie and her son can both see humor in them. THANKS C & C.,1202428800,16,443,3.774193548387097
