I shall come back to this map often. Now, on to the movies. I will first review the Blu-ray release of ""Gettysburg"", then ""Gods and Generals"":

Gettysburg: WHAT MASTER WAS USED FOR THE BD TRANSFER?

An excellent film is hampered in its Director's Cut release by what appears to be a multi-generational master and not the original film master. Contrast is too great in shadows and some bright areas are too brilliant. If technicians doing high definition transfers don't use the original film master, BD will bring out what defects there are in the master used. The BD transfer does bring out fine details, such as battle flags and the crude weave in the cloth used for Confederate officer uniforms.

One scene was added to the Director's Cut with Lee addressing General Ewell and his officers as to why Cemetery Ridge wasn't taken, which was important. If anything, it needed to be with the original release. The addition of the other scenes missing from the original release don't really add to the overall pace of the action.

This film has held a special place in my heart ever since it came out, and I'm sorry that my father predeceased its production and release. I'm sure he would have greatly enjoyed it, as he was an avid Civil War historian, as I am. Additionally, I'm sorry that a better quality master was not used for the BD transfer; we can only hope that a better transfer will happen some day.

Gods and Generals: NEW EXTENDED DIRECTOR'S CUT IMPROVES COHERENCY OF AN IMPORTANT CIVIL WAR FILM

With the additional hour of cut scenes from the theatrical release reinstated into this extended director's cut, it was good that Executive Producer Ted Turner and Producer Ronald Maxwell agreed to divide this very long film into five distinct segments to allow the average moviegoer not all that knowledgeable in Civil War history to take it in in chapters, as if he/she were reading a novel. That is the major plus for this edition, and was done similarly for the three days of their earlier film, ""Gettysburg"". The other was the reinstatement of the Antietam portion of the film. Plus, the reinstatement of previously cut camp life scenes helped add to the human interest side of the characters.

But I feel that there are still problems with the film. The majority of my comments are based on my earlier reading of Jeff Sharra's novel of the same name, upon which the movie is based, plus some other elements unique to the film itself:

1) I don't know why it was decided to insert a subplot involving John Wilkes Booth. Booth had no involvement whatsoever in the original novel, and his scenes as a noncombatant were a distraction and I felt they detracted somewhat from the flow and effect of the action.

2) The novel had greater involvement of Union General Winfield Scott Hancock. As with the theatrical release, Hancock is still relegated to a minor role in the extended director's cut, though a couple scenes involving him were reinstated in the Fredericksburg segment. The novel had him more involved in the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, which unfortunately was apparently not scripted for the movie at all. Greater involvement of Hancock along with that of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain would likely have balanced out the film toward a more neutral stance instead of being heavily-balanced toward that of Lee and Jackson, possibly helping to improve its performance at the box office during its theatrical run.

3) There was a situation where I felt there was questionable film editing. The Moss Neck segment included scenes post-battle from Fredericksburg that should have remained with the Fredericksburg segment. Moss Neck should have started properly at the point with the Christmas Day celebration of the Southern generals and women.

Quality of the BD video transfer and audio were excellent, with notable improvement to the audio from that of the previous BD theatrical cut release.",1310428800,7,4715,5.158376963350785
4437013,5,B004OA684O,"I'm taking a leap in faith or as some would say, going out on a limb to give this review.  Before my life became absorbed with War, History, Cooking and Family I enjoyed casual reading on the Civil War and read Killer Angels in fits and spurts before Gettysburg hit the big screen. I worked my way through college earning a BA in History and an MA in Social Sciences, and ended up studying the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam.

I then moved to Shepherdstown WV, the very doorstep to Antietam National Battlefield.  In doing so I finished my masters degree by completing my thesis on ""Afternoon at Lower Bridge"", focusing on the tactics and strategy that took place at the Lower Bridge, now known as Burnside Bridge.  I came to realize that there were a lot of different perspectives, viewpoints and theories on what took place, and the only thing we know today is that the battle took place on that hallowed ground.  Everything else is up for speculation, including the thoughts of the commanders, soldiers and even more so the historians that later transposed the early words of those that fought the battles.

With that being said these movies are interpretations of what took place on the battlefields 150 years ago.  True, we know who fought on what side, but other than that, we really don't know exactly what took place.  Suffice to say Battlefield Historians, Park Rangers, Noted Historians and Tour Guides that have spent years studying the war and they are the ones we need to go to for exact information.

With that being said I really enjoyed the 1 hr addition to Gods and Generals, and loved seeing the theatrical release of Gettysburg last week at the Gettysburg Visitor Center hosted by Ron Maxwell.  The extended version of Gettysburg has an additional 17 minutes and it was nice to here Ron's words as to why they produced the movie.  It was also shocking to see that at least 20 in the audience had never seen the movie and this was their first time.

Gods and Generals really filled out with addition of cutting room floor video such as the John Wilkes Booth subplot, Antietam battle scenes and reworking the entire movie to flow better.  It really gives you a wonderful cinematographic representation of what took place leading up to Gettysburg, and you need to take it in with a grain of salt.  If you want exacting science then take the time to walk the fields and read into what the soldiers said and ask park rangers to explain what took place.  Remember this movie was historically based but there is always room for artistic licensing and movie drama to make a good picture.

Gettysburg is pretty much the way it was when it came out with snippets here and there added in and I've not had the complete opportunity to fully watch the extended version from start to finish.  When I get the chance I'll spend some time watching Gettysburg uninterrupted and come back to give a final accounting as to the extended version.

The Limited Collectors Edition with Sesquicentennial coin, booklets of Civil War information and nice storage box make a nice movie package.  I recommend this package to anyone interested in a well research theatrical version of the Civil War.  My apologies to anyone I may have offended, but as my good friend Ed Bearss told me, ""...movies get people to the battlefield to walk the grounds to see and understand what happened and to talk to the rangers about what took place.""

One last point to make - The Blu-ray version at the Gettysburg Visitor Center is selling for $130.00 and the DVD version is selling for $100.00.  Save some money and purchase on Amazon, it's the same package for 50% less.",1310342400,24,3659,4.657853810264386
4437014,4,B004OA684O,"This is what the film IS and SHOULD be. It fills in many of the gaps from the theatrical release. And although there are still some slow parts I do not care for, they are now virtually drowned out by new and extended scenes. The battle scenes are better than any other Civil War film made to date. This newer version has more life to it and is certainly more cohesive.
We see more sides to Stonewall Jackson. He's less of the ""Santa Claus-like"" character some labeled him as in the theatrical release. Perhaps just as important is that his character doesn't dominate this version as it did in the original. He still has a major role, but the film doesn't revolve around him. And although Jeff Daniels' performance as Joshua Chamberlain is not quite as good here as it was in ""Gettysburg,"" his added scenes enhance the film.

""Gettysburg"" is the better of the two, but they are both worthy films.

So this short review basically amounts to little more than a recommendation to see the original vision for ""Gods and Generals."" Watch it and judge for yourself.",1309996800,62,1057,4.587301587301587
4437015,1,B004OA684O,"Gettysburg is a fine film and well-acted.  Gods and Generals is ponderous, boring, and overall, utterly lacking.  Root canal was less painful than sitting through this turgid melodrama. Humorously, it is a prequel to Gettysburg, but Jeff Daniels (as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain) is noticeably heavier and older.  Stephen Lang segues from the self-absorbed, perfumed dandy George Pickett in Gettysburg to the devout, if somewhat eccentric, Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals.

Buy Gettysburg separately and save yourself lots of money.",1309219200,4,538,5.6875

I saw it in a widescreen format theater in '93 and was ""eyes up, jaw down"" during the large scale scenes of fighting.  I am also curiously drawn to Jeff Daniels portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain.  It just feels eerily natural.  As a recent adopter of of the BluRay format, I eagerly look forward to seeing this movie on my large screen television, munching popcorn on a Sunday afternoon, and being amazed again as I was almost 20 years ago.",1307750400,9,506,4.651685393258427

Though I preferred Robert Duvall's portrayal of Lee over Martin Sheen's (who sounded too much like Jimmy Carter), the best acting award goes to Stephen Lang for his enthusiastic portrayal of Pickett and wonderfully sympathetic lead role as Stonewall Jackson.  Besides the obvious benefit of Director's cut, particularly the initial sequence in Gettysburg of Buford's stand on the first day, each movie has very entertaining bonus features.  I particularly enjoyed the Ken Burns and Shelby Foote interviews about Gettysburg.

Almost everyone has seen the magnificent GETTYSBURG,  and those who have seen GODS AND GENERALS....well, I'm not so sure. From what little I know, apparently the initial theatrical release was a bit of a disaster.  Apparently it was heavily edited , and a bit confusing.  Anyway, as you'll see in the introduction ,  this is the version of G.A.G. as was originally intended to be seen, and it is a magnificent film.  I don't have to speak for GETTYSBURG,  because we already know how terrific that was! I encourage anyone who has seen the first film to check this out -  whether it be this deluxe set with all kinds of cool extras, or the extended version of GODS AND GENERALS, because it flushes out all the historical details  and characters leading up to the battle of Gettysburg.
I recommend getting this soon, because it seems there's a ""politically correct"" movement to  erase all traces of the Old South from our history,  and like the Confederate flags that Amazon has removed from availability, this may be coming next.",1436313600,4,1094,4.735449735449736

Gods and generals get minus zero stars. This film is nothing more than propaganda favoring a group of very nasty humans of the era. This film is so pro-CSA that I find it insulting. The producers of gods and generals might as well do another movie called gods and reichsfurers, glorifying heinrich himmler and goring (not much different in terms of morality).

Gods and Generals came out and a number of my friends were very disappointed. I couldn't argue. We knew a number of people who are in various shots of theaters, VMI and such that just didn't materialize. Add to that the fact the original release seemed more like only a movie on Stonewall Jackson and not much else, and the opinions were made.

By completing both movies with all the footage, a much, much better Civil War story is told. A few errors, such as the superimposed date for Antietam with an incorrect date, don't detract from the full story.

I also wish to comment that it appears to me some tweaking must have been done to the films to make the the colors different. The night scenes look  more like night, and the warmth of a campfire looks more real. I can't quite explain it, but something was done and it adds to it.",1417910400,,1116,4.274881516587678

Scenes that watchers of the theatrical version have practically memorized are abridged, and Gen. Jackson' pre-battle prayer is eliminated completely.

I was somewhat blindsided by this, thinking the Director's Cut would contain the whole of theatrical release, and then more. But it doesn't. It is hardly recognizable as the same movie. Good, but don't expect it to simply be a G&G with added scenes.",1399680000,,575,4.927835051546392

In the twenty years since, the films'place as an important telling of the legendary battle of 1863. Intended as a mini-series for broadcast television,the poor reaction to ""Son of the Morning Star"",almost killed the ""Gettysburg ""project. Only the interest and deep pockets of Ted Turner,kept the production alive. But,critical reaction was lukewarm from the critics in 1993,fans of the genre supported ""Gettysburg"".For years fans waited for the second film in the proposed trilogy ""Gods & Generals"",finally in 2003;the second film arrived in cinemas. The simple truth was the second film was just not a very good effort. The movie lost millions and the third film may never be made. The fact that a part of the film was left on the cutting room floor, left a ready market for a copy of the film with the cuts restored. This ollector's edition fills the bill nicely, now priced right considering the extras included;this edition has much to recommend it. The packaging and features made this a must own for fans of this genre.

Brother against brother...what a thought..and there are many misunderstandings about the whys and events in order. I was just blown away at the filming of Gettysburg on the real battlefield...if you have never been there it is hallowed ground. It is such a place to see with hundreds of markers and to get the feel for how suicidal Pickett's charge was across the huge flat expanse of treeless field. How so many truly bright men on both sides failed to stop the whole thing...Lee has since been surmised as maybe having some mini strokes and was sleep deprived at this point. Gods and Generals focuses on Stonewall Jackson whose death was a tragic accident by his own groups. His death was pivotal to the outcome of the war, such a powerful General and leader of men he was. I recommend this 150th collection to anyone who would like to have this collection of film and memorabilia
in their library. It was a time of real heroes on both sides and Lincoln's death led us down a wrong path  of terrible reconstruction. Highly recommend!",1373760000,,1436,4.721115537848606

4437099,4,B004OA684O,"Gods And Generals is one of those love it or hate it movies. I love it. Would I love it without my already existing interest in the subject matter? No, probably not.

The story is too unfocused for those who aren't interested in digging deep into the humanity behind the history. The original theatrical release tried to address that by cutting just over an hour of finished film from the story and focusing primarily on Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. This seems like a good decision on the surface. Jackson was certainly a character primed for greater exposure. One of those names almost everyone has heard and yet only a few really know, his story makes a great pitch product. And not only because he was arguably one of the greatest military minds of the nineteenth century.

Like another American general who greatly admired him, Jackson's great positives were balanced by eccentricities that make him a fascinating character. But unlike the successful transfer to film made with the life of George S. Patton, this treatment won neither critic's accolades nor box office bounty.

The deficiency is not in trying to say too little, but in trying to say too much. The film Gods and Generals, like Gettysburg before it, is a labor of love from Ted Turner and Ronald F. Maxwell. The later produced ""prequel"" shares the wonderful source material, the superlative acting and the eye for authenticity. But Gettysburg had a natural advantage for a film version... the battle lasted three days. Those three days form an arc that limits the desires of the producer and director to tell more story, and that moves the film inexorably to a certain conclusion.

Gods and Generals covers a period of roughly three years. And it shows.

As an illustration of history, it shines. The film tells stories worth telling. And it has its flashes of genius, especially when it concentrates on the humanity of these men. In particular, the intense love between Jackson and his wife Anna. Rarely has a film about a man of war so concentrated on the love he bears his family. When Jackson holds his infant daughter for the first time, to the great applause of his men, it is hard to be untouched.

It is also hard to make it through the film without gaining a far greater appreciation for the valor of the men and women who suffered what is unquestionably the most trying time in American history. The nation lost two and a half percent of its population to the Civil War, almost six hundred thousand souls. As horrible as that sounds, the equivalent percentage today would be around seven million. Whole towns were empty of young men of military age at the end of the conflict.

The newest version of the film, released last year as a Director's Cut on Blu-Ray, addresses the problem by splitting the narrative into five parts and restoring the once removed footage. It is a positive change. Watch the five hours over the course of a week and let the impact be felt without the distraction of glancing at the clock. You'll be fascinated by the extra attention to detail and enjoy the information about Robert E. Lee, Joshua Chamberlain and the citizens and soldiers of the era.

It's worth seeing, and everything you see is remarkably accurate for a piece focusing as much on entertainment as history. And the filmmakers very deliberate decision to tone down the gore and bloodshed makes the piece more accessible for a general audience. But unless you are a true fan of Civil War history, don't try to take it all in a single sitting.

4437101,5,B004OA684O,"As a Gettysburg fan, I was really pleased with this purchase. The older video version I had looked like a cheap copy from a guy in a trenchcoat, but that was what was at one time available. This new product is crisper by far, revealing things I had never been able to see or hear, like the fact it is visibly raining with thunder in the background as Gen. Buford arrives through the orchard near Seminary Ridge. The additional footage, however, really, really helps the story line. (If you are historically inclined, it was the only weakness of this movie as shown in theaters.) So many things that are essential to the story were left out of the theater version. The brief interview with generals included with this cut regarding why fire was not placed on the hills behind Gettysburg at the end of day 1 is critical to the quality of the story. I had been disappointed in Gods and Generals when it came out - poor CGI, actors who were older, but supposedly younger in chronology of events, and a less cohesive story line. This version is much improved, even given those general drawbacks. The additional footage helps this become much more tolerable as well. You will LOVE this.

4437102,1,B004OA684O,"As a civil war devotee and lover of American history, this travesty of the lengthening of Gods and Generals should be shelved once and for all. The hour of added footage did little to save an already flop. Mr. Maxwell's film portrait of Gettsyburg was a fine and noble effort to show the war as it was at that time with, I feel, a somewhat better cast. Firstly, Stephen Lang is a really great character actor (loved him as Pickett and in Tombstone), BUT he doesn't have the chops for a feature film role. He overacted from scene one. The extra footage of camp life and interacting with soldiers at night around the campfire did little to add to the boredom. Antietam was well done though, but should have had more time to show it's impact as the bloodiest day of the war. Jeff Daniels did his usual fine acting and Robert Duvall was good but enigmatic as Lee (Martin Sheen was excellent).
But, the insertion of scenes with Booth were bad TV miniseries acting at best. The soundtrack was ponderous as opposed to noble during battle sequences.  The Carmina Burana music behind the Chancellorsville battle was too loud and out of place. Fredericksburg may have been the high point of the battle sequences.
But, the foremost reason that I gave this film one star was the absolute debauchery of casting that high school class play actor to be Lincoln. Mr. Maxwell made Lincoln's character, the greatest president in our history, to be nothing short of a TV used car ad during Presidents Day week!! Shame on you Mr. Maxwell!

Many had criticized the theatrical release saying it wasn't as good as Gettysburg and served more as a platform to bio Stonewall Jackson.  And they may have been right.  But as many other reviewers have said, this version offers a more complete picture by including Antietam, Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth and a slightly broader focus on the issue of slavery (although it still seems to view slavery as more of an annoyance to those who were enslaved than as the horror that it was).

4437110,5,B004OA684O,"Just when I thought nothing more could be done to Gettysburg to improve or add to it, the 150th Commemorative edition is released and I am drawn to it again like a moth to a flame. Ron Maxwell's fifteen year odyssey to bring the movie to life and onto the big screen was finally realised once Ted Turner agreed to bankroll the film.  It's easy to see that this film is a labor of love for Maxwell and at four and a half hours long when first released, who would have thought that the addition of another 17 minutes of compelling footage would contribute any further benefit to the movie or possibly make it flow any better - but it does!

As for the Gettysburg prequel, I remember when God's and General's was first released and the confusion of many members of the audience who did not have a strong grasp of American Civil War history - their movie experience was totally lost on the cutting room floor.  Now, with the release of the Director's cut the movie finally has order and a structure that can be followed without being an ACW Historian. The first observation to hit me was that the structure that was missing from God's and General's before was now in place. How? Well it seems to me that the film has now been divided into five distinct parts: Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Moss Neck, and finally Chancellorsville. This definitely allows the film to actually guide its Audience through the first three years of the war. The structure is so complete that each section, like acts from a play, provides the mental map of events that was missing from the original film, which is an essential addition when you consider the complexity of the characters, story and the length of this film.

In the new cut, Antietam is an incredible experience. There is also the appearance of John Wilkes Booth into the movie, which provides an interesting insight into the actor(and assassin to be) during the early years of the war. However, be aware that there is not just the addition of new scenes, but the reduction and removal of others. Some scenes have actually been either shortened, or removed and to give you a hint of what isn't there so much anymore, don't expect to sit through the constant preaching and praying that was in the original theatrical release.",1323388800,4,2268,4.634328358208955

Gods & Generals, however has a lot of extras (Note: I never saw the original directors cut, only the theatrical release), I originally thought that the film was ""OK"" at release, but after watch this Extended Directors Cut, I liked it a lot more and felt it a more worthy prequel than I had in the past.

4437113,2,B004OA684O,"""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" both have strengths and weaknesses.

""Gettysburg"" is a mostly good movie with the sort of epic scope we thought we would never see again after the death of David Lean.  It's the kind of movie we thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make.  It's also rousing.  Is there a boy reared in the south who did not sit in the theater actually believing this time Pickett's charge would break through?

One weakness of the movie is Martin Sheen's miserable performance as Robert E. Lee.  The novel's author Michael Shaara describes Lee as under the weather during the battle.  May be.  Sheen's Lee seems to be suffering from Alzheimer's.  He's waffling, indecisive, ineffective, far from the commander Lee actually was.  And he was not suffering from mental problems.  After the war he went on to Washington College (now Washington and Lee) and was one of the chief figures in healing the rejoined United States after the war.  Southern accents are difficult in the best of times for non-southerners (the Brits do it best).  Sheen, from Ohio, hasn't a clue.  His performance nearly kills an otherwise good movie and I cannot watch ""Gettysburg"" again because of it.

Another flaw is that Michael Shaara's novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975, was based on the best scholarship on the battle available at the time.  Since then, new scholarship has revised our understanding of strategic decisions made by the participants.  These new ideas probably should have been incorporated into the film.  Since when has Hollywood cared about fidelity to a novel, anyway?

""Gettysburg"" also leans too heavily in favor of Longstreet who, more than anyone, is a central player in this game.  That bit of historical revisionism did make it in the film but I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinions.

The otherwise fine cast pulls the movie through to the finish line, particularly Jeff Daniels as the Yank Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and the Reb General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan, very affecting in his final film role;  every actor who was once a star should have such an exit).

""Gods and Generals"" has almost diametrically opposed strengths and weaknesses.  One thing is does right is cast Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee.  Duvall's Lee is the heart of this film. And a game cast does its best playing soldier.  What ""God"" lacks that ""Gettysburg"" had is focus.  It tries to do too much with one movie, following the war from just after the outbreak of hostilities when Lee was offered command of the defense of Washington (April 18, 1861) until the death of Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville -- just a few months before Gettysburg.  That's a lot of information for one movie.

I had hoped the extended version of ""Gods"" would keep the movie from feeling so jumpy and forced, but it only adds more boring stuff to what's there already.

In both movies, keep an eye peeled for James Patrick Stuart from ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"" as artillery commander and post-war scribe Porter Alexander;  and in ""Gods"" watch for William Sanderson -- Larry, brother of Darryl in ""Newhart"" -- as Confederate General A. P. Hill.

A third installment, about the end of the war, was planned, but it was shelved when ""Gods"" tanked at the box office.  It's just as well.",1317081600,7,3298,4.874100719424461

4437122,5,B004OA684O,"The Gods & Generals and Gettysburg ""Limited Collectors Edition"" is much longer and smooths out the story line much better.  There was no effort to correct the flaws, such as Gettysburg's rank change on Maj. Walter H. Taylor (Brinkman) from Maj. to Lt. Col. when history proves this false; Longstreet's beard forever moving in length in the same scene, Capt. Goree's rank is wrong-he wouldn't become a Captain until 1864, he was addressed as Captain because Longstreet couldn't use Brevet rank for this faithful soldier and many more flaws too much to list here.  Gods & General's biggest flaw was the reverse film causing the swords to hang on the right side (Chapter 26)where Hood (Gorman) is asked if he thinks he will survive the war, Stonewall Jackson (Lang) doing the asking.  Poor editing in my opinion, there were many more flaws, too many to list here.  There are portions that are missing from the original release, so though the major portion of the movies are intact --there are so many changes and extra story in this newest release, in both Gettysburg and Gods & Generals, it is a new story--a smoother transaction and makes more sense then the original releases that were butchered.  Yes it is very long.  Hit the pause button but, this length was a more proper length for the topic. Can't fit a three day battle into two disks without problems.  Still not as satisfied as I should be, as I would think edits could have been made with G&G's Chapter 26, to correct how the swords hung, put the generals in proper protocol.  I'll wait for a better Civil War movie/series to be made, ""To Appomattox"" may be the one that will do a better job.  Love the actors!  Bravo to all the actors in both Gettysburg & Gods & Generals.  The plus of these movies in the past or re-release, is that it provokes interest in the American Civil War in this the Civil War's Sesquicentennial cycle (1861-1865)and why it matters today. Please attend re-enactments and Living History events to be more authentically involved in a educational way verses 'art licensed entertainment'",1312934400,2,2070,4.754189944134078
4437123,5,B004OA684O,"I really enjoy both of these films.  People can argue that they are not perfect, but I defy anyone to find a more authentic pair of civil war movies.  I enjoyed the box set, it was a good value for the price.  I also enjoyed the extended versions of these films, I cant get enough of this stuff",1312675200,,294,4.0344827586206895
4437124,3,B004OA684O,"First of all, let me say that were I just reviewing the movies in the this package, I would be rating Gettysburg at 5 stars and Gods and Generals at 4 (and I think the Director's edition does nothing but enhance both movies' excellence).

My 3 star rating is down averaging in the lack of commitment that the studio has shown to this release, for which I would give 1 star.

The quality of Gettysburg is no better than was the DVD release.  There is an excessive amount of grain in the image that looks like the result of working from a lower quality digital copy than what you get from going back to the original material.  This isn't grain added for cinematic effect but just poor mastering.

The extra features disc in Gettysburg isn't even a blu-ray and is just a DVD.  So, the level of effort on this portion is actually lower than the poor effort shown for the movie itself.

Gettysburg is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of its kind and I was really hopeful that coming on the 150th anniversary, this edition would be an all-out effort to put the technological quality on par with the movie-making quality.  I am sadly dissappointed.

Get the movies themselves for the improvement that the Director's editions bring to the table but know that these are far from reference quality, which is exactly what they deserved, especially for such a momentus anniversary.",1312156800,7,1375,4.579591836734694
4437125,4,B004OA684O,"When I saw that Warner Bros. was finally going to release Gods & Generals and Gettysburg in the director's cut format I was elated beyond belief. These two movies are at the top of my list of Civil War movies. Yes, I know about some of the inaccuracies - it's unfortunate that most (if not all) historical movies have their faults - but I still really love these two movies up and beyond all others of their genre.
Being as anxious as I was, I did not want to wait until July for the box set and ended up purchasing both as individuals upon their release in May. Now, before I get into the actual reviews of the movies themselves I would like to review the packaging. The individual release packaging was one of the best I have seen for any movie. Not only does one receive the extended director's cut of both movies but a full booklet with each set! These booklets include notes from Ron Maxwell himself, information about the battles, the actors and the historical figures they portray, and loads of photos. There is also plenty of Civil War facts and figures including a time line.
I was like a kid at Christmas...better yet, these sets were released two days after my birthday - what a gift!
Let's jump up a couple of months and I'm at the local department store and I see the Box Set of both movies. By purchasing this set I would also receive (besides the movies themselves) a commemorative bronze Lincoln coin, a 40 page photo booklet of Civil War artifacts and correspondence, a 32 page booklet from Time magazine's new book on the Civil War, and even a two-sided historical map. Okay, being the Gettysburg and Gods & Generals fan that I am. I went home and found it even cheaper on Amazon, so I shelled out the bucks (a good discount, I might add, so re-buying the movies wasn't too terribly wasteful) for the set. I figured I can give the extra movies away as a gift.
I have to admit I was slightly disappointed. Not necessarily in the items that came with the box set itself, but with the disc packaging: the awesome booklets that were in my May releases were nowhere to be found. Instead, the packagings of both movies were in simple average Blu Ray plastic boxes. I would have thought, without question, that the very same packaging from May would have been included in this collector's box set. I must say I am now glad I purchased the movies individually instead of only waiting for the box. To me, as a collector, it was well worth the money (especially at the discounted pricing). But, because of WB chinsing on the packaging for the box, I gave this set 4 instead of 5 stars.
So, now I am going to give away the box set discs and just slide in the booklet versions (I had to remove the cardboard insert from the box - no big deal) and I will have the ultimate Gods & Generals and Gettysburg Box Set!
Now for the movies:
GODS & GENERALS:
Gods and Generals does a very good job at depicting the earlier battles of the Civil War. Although it's always leaned heavily toward the southern point of view in its original form, this new director's cut has been divided into chapters and totally re-edited to fit in the extra hours worth of scenes, some of which include involving President Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth, more of the Chamberlains, and, especially for fans of battles, Antietam. It now gives a more balanced perspective of North and South. Because the entire movie has been re-edited in this way I don't believe I could watch the original theatrical release again. Yes, all the scenes are there - intact - but the entire movie is so much less choppy and so much more cohesive (it would have been nice to show the picnicking civilians at Manassas - oh well...).
A couple of my favorite parts of the newly restored scenes includes the showing of camp life in a union camp, including teaching the new recruits the way to load and fire a gun, and the meeting of Joshua and Fannie Chamberlain with actor Booth.
Pay close attention to the other actor who is with Booth toward the end of the movie...
Gods & Generals has much more drama than most battle-oriented films, but that just gives the viewer a much more well-rounded feeling of life during the early 1860's.
GETTYSBURG:
Except for a few exceptions (why are there always exceptions?) Gettysburg is another MOSTLY historically correct film. I feel the biggest reason for this is due to the fact that re-enactors have played such a prominent role in the making of both of these films, making sure that they're as historically correct as the producers would allow, right down to the buttons on the uniforms worn by the fighting men (yes, yes, I KNOW about the facial hair, but those aren't re-enactors! Blame the costume/make up people on that!). And the battle scenes are as realistic as can possibly be done. When you watch the men during Pickett's charge and see the anguished look on the general's face during the aftermath, one gets the feeling of actually witnessing the carnage that took place.
And the Little Round Top scene will get your heart beating just as it must have beat in the men who were there. Truly gripping.
Another very long but engulfing movie filled with battles and tactics, this truly brings the viewer into the horrific time of early July 1863.
Both movies help to bring the people of the Civil War alive - the men on both sides who fought in this war are no longer just old sepia-toned pictures in a history book, or silly 1950's b-movie style characters, but real men who fought and died horrible deaths. I wish more historical epics would use re-enactors in the movie making process (The Conspirator did!). They truly help bring the past to life.
Jeff Shaara, author of the original book on which Gods & Generals is based, stated in an interview (from the Gods and Generals magazine), ""Hollywood has a dismal record of portraying history. Historical films have one purpose - to make money - and it seems they have two means of realizing that. One, tell a story the studio thinks the audience wants to see, and thus tilt the story to whatever political correctness is in vogue. The second purpose is to allow one particular big time actor the chance to do 'cool things' on the screen. Though many of these films are entertaining, the one thing missing is any responsibility to give the audience the truth about the event being portrayed.""
It's unfortunate that too many people take Hollywood historical movies as fact and the majority of movie watchers usually do not get a good part of the truth. Gods & Generals and Gettysburg are different - they do a better job than most at accuracy. Do not let the length scare you off. From beginning to end, I was held to my seat, greatly anticipating the next scene of both films.
I highly recommend purchasing both movies - whether through the box set or individually - and spending a weekend (and it will take an entire weekend!) in the early 1860's.
By the way, I would absolutely love to see a movie showing what the civilians of the town of Gettysburg had to endure during that summer - and even into November for Lincoln's visit - of 1863. Many folks do not realize what they went through during (and for months after) the battle. Every bit as exciting as the battle itself!
One more thing, if you get a chance, please do yourself a favor and
(A) take a trip to Gettysburg to see for yourself the awesome battlefields and still-intact town. And it's within an hour from Antietam, an hour and a half from Harper's Ferry, and just a few hours from most other east coast battle fields. It would be a vacation steeped in history.
(B) Go to a Civil re-enactment and see for yourself the excitement of battle.
Thank you to all involved for bringing our history to life accurately!",1311638400,44,7721,4.539454806312769
4437126,5,B004OA684O,"Ok, first of all I love both of these movies.  I am especially interested in seeing the Extended Director's Cut of Gods and Generals because of the additional hour of footage and a completely reedited movie.  My problem, I don't currently have Blu Ray so I would be forced to pay $50 to buy this package just to obtain a copy of Gods and Generals Extended Cut on DVD.  I have already purchased Gettysburg twice since it came out.  Once in VHS and another copy when it came out on DVD.  From my research, the Gettysburg Extended Director's Cut only adds 17 minutes of additional footage and doesn't really add much to the original version.  So I don't want to buy it again.
