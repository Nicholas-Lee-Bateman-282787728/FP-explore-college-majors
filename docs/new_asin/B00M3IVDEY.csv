8670029,3,B00M3IVDEY,"I agree totally with the last reviewer. Good singing does not make a DVD of Carmen if the sexuality of Carmen is lacking from the direction. The direction takes away any of the substance of what really makes Carmen a desirable woman. I feel that the director here has forced upon a tale of one of the great stories,a  parable about dometic violence. It  does not work,and doet not explain why a man would want to destroy his own life as well another's.",1467849600,,452,4.433734939759036
8670030,4,B00M3IVDEY,"I will second parts of Denise Katz's review, while disagreeing with a few others: The stage/opera/production director Matthias Hartmann is an obvious (insert an inappropriate word here). He's a complete (insert an inappropriate word here) pandering to the masses or the younger generation of (insert an inappropriate word here) followers: He makes Kauffmann a geek with thick glasses who sucks on paperclips (all he needs is some tape on the bridge of the glasses--how could that subtlety have been overlooked?), puts a television monitor playing a soccer match on stage in the tavern scene (how old is that cliche--the old video camera or monitor on stage?), covers the prompter's box with a variety of junky comical gizmos, including a dog who wags his tail approvingly at good singing, and is guilty of a hundred other pop culture vapidities. But, but, but: Kaufman survives the kitch, and even more gloriously so does Carmen, Vesselina Kasarova (or however you spell her name: I don't have time to check). Kasarova in fact turns in a Carmen for the ages. A completely different Carmen from any of those I have ever seen. She is NOT silky, sultry, and sexy. She is NOT vampy and hot and smoky. But she is completely convincing in her own way, as a slightly haggard, more than world-weary, well-worn, been-around-the-block-more-than-a-few-times lover. Her voice is tough (but not abrasive), her intonations are hard (but not unmelodic). She, in short, re-imagines the role and makes it her own, once and forever, uniquely her own. Kaufmann, as good as he is, is coasting, comfortable, relaxed compared to her. I would rate the staging zero stars (if there were such a rating), but Kasasova's singing ten (if there were such a rating). A Carmen (the character if not the production) not soon to be forgotten. Never to be forgotten. The singers survive the dramatic manhandling. Thank goodness.",1456272000,3,1894,5.035031847133758
8670031,2,B00M3IVDEY,"What a waste of exceptional Kaufmann talent.  The sparsce staging was bad enough but the sillly acting was too much for me.  The only thing that saved this one was Bizet and Mr Kaufamnns singing.  I usually like operas updated to modern time.  The Detroit Opera had great updated version of Tosca.  However, this Carmen does not come close to either Detroit or the London production of Carmen.
A very big disappointment and a big waste of Josna Koumanns talents.",1434067200,2,462,4.725

8670033,5,B00M3IVDEY,"After reading other unfavorable Amazon reviews, I was very pleasantly surprised that this performance is actually quite good. The singing and acting are both good all around, may be except  Escamillo. Kasarova is convincing as Carmen. She looks beautiful, but sometimes she overacts  at the expense of her singing. Kaufman as usual superb. Although staging is low budget and high concept, it does not hinder the music nor the plot. Franz Wesler-Most conducts expertly. This production is alive and moving.",1430956800,2,505,5.3
8670034,2,B00M3IVDEY,"The director obviously doesn't understand a word of French as the words are constantly saying ""soldier"" when the persons referred to are dressed as policemen. And then there is the setting:  a large white disc that looks as though the action is taking place on a beach.. Jonas Kaufmann is the only reason for watching this. His final scene is extremely moving. The other characters except for the Dancaire of Gabriel Bermudez are mediocre. The conducting is fine and the sound excellent. But what is Carmen without a Carmen?",1430265600,2,524,4.887640449438202
8670035,1,B00M3IVDEY,"If you expect a Carmen more or less as Bizet composed it do not get this DVD.
You start the opera on a deserted beach. A dozen is soldiers arrive ,carrying a chair and a beach umbrella. They sing about a crowed plaza,but no crowd.then,there is an attempt rape of Michaela who leaves in her underwear. A bunch of ragged children sings of a changing of the guard,but no guards. Suddenly Don Jose appears ,acting like a geek. A neon sign of a cigar appears with a bunch of women smoking cigars(phallic symbol)!!!Crmen arrives in a little dress,apron and high heels,not particularly sexy or even sensous. Reapperance of Micheala in her underwear,putting her dress in front of Don Jose who does not find this strange.no real chemistry between Carmen and Don Jose .
The tavern of act two could be found in any street;no zingaras but Dancaire and his partners disguised as soldiers. Carmen attempts at dancing,but she does not succeed. Escamillo arrives,looking more like a wrestler than a torero..Carmen is still inthe same outfit as in the first act.
Act three starts not in the mountains but in a very flat surface. Crnen,still in the same dress and high heels does not sing well the cards song;you do not feel the foreboding of the violent end. For the confrontation between Escamillo and Don Jose,he takes two knives from a box on the set! The act ends without the violence .Act four takes place on desolate space with a single tree. A bunch of children sing of the pageantry of the corrida but no pageantry. Carmen (same dress without the apron)and Escamillo in black sing of love,but again no chemistry. The only thing she does well,is to die.
Musically,I find this Carmen very mild ,Michaela and Don Jose are the only good singers. Kaufmann is very good. Frankly,the sexuality and violence which chocked so must the audience at the premiere are absent from this DVD,but if you are a fan of Kaufmann,like I am,go for it.",1422230400,11,1920,4.717261904761905
8670036,4,B00M3IVDEY,"The mechanical dog in act 1 along with the wandering intonation by the flute soloist in the entr'acte to Act 3 are my only seriously negative comments.  I don't understand what the purpose of the dog is.  Until hearing this performance by Kasarova, I believed that no one could be better suited for the Carmen role than Marilyn Horne. Horne and Kasarova both have voices that are darkly sultry in the low registers that work so well for Carmen, but I do think Kasarova is better.  Kaufmann's voice, as always, has the range of a tenor but the weight of a baritone; that works well in all performances I have heard by Kaufmann (such as Parsifal.)  The ""mama's boy"" Don Jos&eacute; portrayed by Kaufmann early on seemed odd relative to his reactions to Micaela and finally to Carmen.  I suppose Don Jos&eacute;'s sharp turn from nerd to murderer was effected by his immaturity.  As to the sets, I prefer simple sets over kitschy, overstated sets that often elicit audience applause.  Probably there are better recordings out there, but I am satisfied with this and my very old LP with James McCracken and Horne.",1420502400,7,1109,4.715025906735751

8670038,3,B00M3IVDEY,"I recently watched this 2009 Kasarova/Kaufmann Carmen Blu-ray from Zurich and was disappointed. While Kaufmann was strong, he was not evolved from the 2006 Antonacci/Kaufmann Carmen from Covent Garden. If anything, he is becoming more prone to oversing, losing resonance to gain (unneeded) volume.
I recently compared the Zurich and Covent Garden Toscas with Kaufmann, and Zurich clearly came out on top. Zrich's director there, Robert Carsen, gave MaGee all the support she needed to produce clear and compelling dramatic, vocal and visual aspects in her portrait of Tosca.
That did not happen here. Kasarova, who has had a good career in mostly bel canto trouser roles, had poor sets, costuming, makeup and concept, and it showed. Welser-Moest conducted well, but her voice was all over the place. Questionable French pronunciation, poor intonation, jumping and flipping from one vocal register to another - she often began in the chest and flipped into head voice. One might think that wearing a cheap dress and using cheap make up and poor hairstyling would be authentic but in this case it was more pathetic. Kasarova is mannish in her head, body and actions. Had someone taken the time she could have been skillfully costumed and made up to resemble a lighter Eartha Kitt, and with some vocal and dramatic coaching we would instantly have gotten why Don Jose was attracted to her. And once again Kaufmann plays this character as an overaged teenager. We don't get to see what the motivation is. At Covent Garden, Antonacci was masterful: from the first time she saw him in Act One her emotions and
motivations passed clearly across her face and her actions and voice brought each of them out for development. Everything onstage supported her in developing her role and interacting with all the other characters.
In Zurich, the set for Act One is a white disc with few beach chairs and an umbrella - and a large stuffed dog, which serves no purpose. The ""regiment"" are traffic or tourist police who are hanging out, and when Micaela enters they surround her and remove her dress before she is able to escape and wander around in public in just her slip. I was offended by that disrespect, and Don Jose didn't seem to notice it when he arrived. Kaufmann came across as distracted, and. Kasarova started the Habanera unable to focus her intonation, missing the habanera rhythm and not moving like she was singing a habanera - body language. She also tends to grimace when she sings, and pull her head back, so we are looking up her nose. If the first act hadn't gotten off to such a poor start I might have felt more generous toward a number of these things.
I watched three other recent videos of Carmen plus the new Reiner CD remastering of Carmen and the others all nailed it. Rise Stevens from over 60 years ago, oozed glamor, sexuality and allure. Antonacci, Surguladze, Garanca and Stevens all created vivid portraits. Kasarova wasn't really able to, and the director gave her no help. Sets were bare-bones - the third Act was again on the white disc, with one tree and no parade until Escamillo came on with a few others, no stadium, just the tree. Act Three has some suitcases and a dark carpet on the disc.
Michele Pertusi plays Escamillo and does a good job as usual. Most recently seen in ""Torvaldo and Dorliska"", an excellent role for him, and noticeably his voice was less resonant at the low end in Carmen, where it counts, because the sets here are basically open or cloth at the back, sides and top. That really hampers the development of resonance and the ability of singers to hear each other and the orchestra. That may explain Pertusi's unusually soft low end and Kasarova's tentativeness.
I haven't anything about Kaufmann. He's good, but not compelling and doesn't do much to help us understand and sympathize with his character. I suspect he's the reason this was issued. Kaufmann chasers will be happy to have this.
And they will certainly already have the Covent garden blu-ray with Antonacci, which is excellent on all counts.
I was also very impressed by the MET production with Garanca and Alagna. He got better as the ooera progressed and by the end he produced a beautiful classic french tenor performance.
I also really liked a Dynamic DVD issue of a 2008 Carmen from the Sferisterio Festival with Surguladze, Do and Alberghini. Very compelling drama without being quite so operatic, while bringing out other aspects of the characters, in a relaxed, natural setting, outdoors but with very good sound. Definitely worth shelf space.",1412640000,20,4565,4.838874680306906
