8241883,5,B0011HO8OA,"This is a great, fascinating FRONTLINE episode!  Controversial because of it's content, and compelling for the very same reason.  Is the Earl of Oxford really William Shakespeare?  This program presents a very good case for it.  So, with all of the other  FRONTLINE episodes available from either Amazon or PBS, why is this one not available?",1279929600,7,342,5.035714285714286
8241884,5,B0011HO8OA,"This episode of PBS's FRONTLINE is a fascinating and compelling presentation of the 'Oxfordian Theory' -- the theory that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (and ward and later son-in-law of William Cecil, Lord Burleigh, Queen Elizabeth I's Lord Chamberlain), was the actual author of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets. (I found the quote from one of the sonnets referring to 'eyes yet unborn' was particularly touching).  I treasure the VHS copy that I made from the PBS broadcast, but I sure wish that it would come out on DVD.

P.S.  Although I have yet to find a DVD of this broadcast, THE SHAKESPEARE CONSPIRACY with Derek Jakobi is a very satisfactory consolation prize!",1248825600,6,675,4.9035087719298245
