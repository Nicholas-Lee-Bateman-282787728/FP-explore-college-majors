1009193,5,630530260X,"""But it's warm inside his eyes ... and it's soft inside his eyes ...""  Some say Sondheim is cerebral and sophisticated.  However, I am always very moved by SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE.  I especially find the  first act to be the best part of the show.  And Sondheim constantly warms  my heart with his lyrics and beautiful music.
The production of the video  of the show is very good.  Lapine gets some good shots, even though it's  basically a taped version of a Broadway show.  The editing in spots is very  good.
Bernadette Peters, a favorite performer of mine, is not in very  good voice for the taping.  I think I've read that she was having vocal  problems at the time.  Some dubbing is apparent in spots.  Mr. Patinkin is  very subdued and subtle in his performance.
The DVD is a preferable way  to watch this show due to its extra audio track of Sondheim, Lapine, Peters  and Patinkin reminiscing about it.  There are some great stories told by  the group.  Mr. Sondheim sheds some light on the earlier drafts of songs  and scenes.
Remember, this show won the Pulitzer Prize!  It is not an  ""Oklahoma"" kind of musical -- it's very artsy and concerns a  difficult man obsessed with his art.  But it is so sweet and clever.  Like  Seurat's famous painting that the musical is based on, the stellar talent  behind the show blend together to produce a truly luminescent experience.",944265600,82,1388,4.546938775510204

1009195,5,630530260X,"I had the CD of this show for a while and to be completely honest, I just didn't like it. But being a Sondheim junkie, I had to buy the video. It was one of the most moving shows I'd ever seen. Now I can't stop listening to  the CD and watching the video. It is my second favorite Sondheim show now  (coming in next to ""Company"").",930787200,3,330,3.91044776119403

After buying the CD of SITPWG, I quickly scooted to a local library and read the script.  Now the  cycle is completed with the movie. This is top-quality work!  Peters and  Patinkin are sublime, a marvelous pair of performers. Catch this and 'Into  the Woods' while you still can!",928800000,,406,4.811594202898551

1009322,5,630530260X,"I loved the production since pbs aired it years ago. The acting and singing are superb. Bernadette peters never ages, both talent and appearances. I see her in this and then newer productions, wow she is amazing. Mandy patinkon is stellar , the character is distant at times and he portrays him well. Brent spiner is also in this version and those who only know him from sci fi may be pleasantly surprised by his portrayal in this.",1486857600,,431,4.538461538461538

1009402,5,630530260X,"I am as entranced as much by this work now as when I first heard it.  It is a masterpiece.  In every respect.  And with 'Sunday in the Park with George' and 'Passion,' Stephen Sondheim (& his collaborators) has shifted the Broadway musical into a completely new orbit.  [Once I thought that 'Into the Woods' was a minor, imperfect work.  It took me a while to come around.  But was I wrong!].  Savor this work & learn from it.  I hope that you enjoy it.  It shimmers with light and love and wonder.  A tribute to ALL those who brought it to life.",1477180800,,546,4.213592233009709

1009409,3,630530260X,I had an audio recording and wanted this to see the show.  Audio  muddy and uncrisp in the fast spots. A few pieces of dialog lost.  Show is lovely.  Too bad the audio wasn't as clean as my little tape.,1464048000,2,202,3.975
1009469,4,630530260X,"Show is great, easily five stars. This cast is also great. I deducted a star because while the audio delivers, the video does not (even for 80s television it's bad), and disappointingly, there are no subtitles available on the DVD. Since it's Sondheim, the lyrics are tricky and you'll likely need the book or the score to get anything out of this filmed version. No special features, but for this price, it's not a big deal. Overall a great and even essential buy for the Sondheim fan.",1459900800,,486,4.597701149425287

1009606,5,630530260X,"""Sunday in the Park with George"" is Sondheim at his most spectacular-- and Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters create lyrical jewels with their magical voices in this symphony of sound and light.

Hearing their voices weave together is amazing. Seeing the story unfold again was amazing!

I had not realized that Sondheim has a ""usual cast of characters"", but seeing the Wolf from ""Into the Woods"" among the characters, playing the Soldier, added another dimension to the story.",1434499200,,479,5.128205128205129

1009609,5,630530260X,"This is one of the very best from the Sondheim stable. Mandy Patinkin shows skill and style in an Edwardian setting that makes the era, the music and the story come alive. The comedy and poignancy of the situation manages to be always at the fore and the shere pleasure in seeng a top of the line Broadway Theatrical production at its best, is the biggest bonus of this DVD.",1428451200,,374,4.357142857142857

1009751,3,630530260X,I didn't really like it. I don't know why but George came across as unlikeable and Bernadette Peters unsympathetic. It couldn't hold my attention. I'm going to try again at another time because I like Mandy Patinkin and Ms. Peters but I'm not hopeful. Songs too far apart and after the first song I kinda tuned out. Very disappointed.,1414108800,,334,4.677966101694915

1009754,5,630530260X,"This musical is great and officially one of my faves from what I've seen. Collecting DVDs isn't as posh as it used to be with the more modern streaming options (Netflix, HULU, HBO Go, etc.), but buying musicals on DVD is one of the few things I will splurge on.",1409529600,,261,4.24

1009756,5,630530260X,"There are really no words to describe what a terrific musical this is. The cast, in addition to Peters and Patinkin (at the peak of their vocal talents) offers a few unexpected surprises I won't mention here. I found the score, the story and its reflections on love and creativity moving. I have seen this play many, many times and played this DVD often as well and I am regularly moved to tears by the songs and vocal gifts of those onstage. Being an artist myself, this play holds a great deal of meaning, but, even without that, the singing here is just a superb wonder.",1406419200,,573,4.415094339622642

1009834,5,630530260X,This is one of the most accessible and enjoyable of the Sondheim musicals.  The performances by Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters are superb and cannot be duplicated by anyone else.  The sets convey the mystery and transcendence of the original painting.  One must put in a lot to get anything from this musical play.  It is not a casual experience.  It is truly an experience for mature people.,1404345600,2,398,4.794117647058823
1009835,5,630530260X,"Hurray for another Sondheim masterpiece--for which he garnered the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama!!! I am always amazed at how Sondheim's brilliance has continuity through all of his works, yet his compositions and style always change (like a chameleon). This work's music reflects the pointillist style of the subject, the painter Seurat, with sometimes choppy (in an artistic, good way) tunes...I love the title song ""Sunday in the Park with George"". And of course, the songs ""Putting It Together"" and ""Move On"" must be mentioned, for they are the pieces that are more identifiable outside of this musical. Sondheim and Lapine weave a story of art, and love, and how to move on with one's life. Dot and George's love for each other is complex and lingering, and the audience view their legacy unfolding, whether they stay together or not.
On to the interpreters...Bernadette Peters. Brava! Her unique tone served her well in this part of Dot, and her artistry was fully on display as her range of emotions was tested and flourished with this material. As for Mandy Patinkin, he was custom-made, perfectly suited for the part of George, the stoic painter who lives for art. Both lead actors snagged Tony nominations but sadly did not win.

Anyway, JUST BUY IT! This Broadway dvd is filmed with precision and great quality with appropriate full-stage shots and close-ups. There is nothing to complain about, unless, of course, this is just not your ""thing""; in that case, you will at least experience the brilliance of Sondheim that leaves you with a musical unlike the work of any other composer. If you buy it, it is money well-spent.",1399248000,,1635,4.923913043478261

1010049,4,630530260X,"I don't regret adding this to my collection. I just reduced it by one star. The set, the seamstresses who assembled the fabulous costumes, this was a day in the park for any and all artists, that is to say, who draw, paint, build sew, assemble . illuminate, record ""artists"". And nothing wrong with the singers. Bernadette shines in this one. Mandy is no slacker either. I personally prefer a baritone with a top A...but that'sjust a personal preference.

But as one reviewer noted...no subtitles. Just because something is in the King's English...that does NOT mean that the words are very well spoken/sung by the players. This is indeed a major flaw...for some 30% of the story is muddled. But it doesn't matter much for the story is fatally flawed to begin with.

My problem is that after listening for decades to music of a wide variety, including bel canto, folk, country, gospel...I said wide variety...I find I am becoming a more than weary of what could be called the ""Broadway muscial motif"".
They have a way of sounding so very similar. It is hard to describe. I'll try this: that the melodies and tempi seem only barely able to emerge from recitative.

Here is a sample of a tune from this show:  C-D; C-D; C-A...and then we ""vary"" that monotony by ending on a 'wistful note'...C-D; CD; C-Ab...
The melody bounces around sort of aimlessly...like the story line. I would not call it a libretto. A libretto has at least some shining star of a hero or heroine, and often both. Here ""George"" is made out to be obsessive compulsive
( dot, dot, dot with his brush, get it? ); totally self absorbed, not even human...his lover and model has a child by him, and he doesn't even turn to look at it, but dismisses the both of them coldly. Does that sound heroic to you? It can only leave one ..uh...hating artists in general? Hating men in general? What are the writer and composer thinking?...are they both chronically cynical. Or wanting to be seen as ""modern', or rather 'post modern' where there is no decency in humankind? Where we eschew anyting remotely like ""prettiness""?

It is said that a successful opera, or musical, should not only cause you to hum the melodies later...but to relish hearing them again and again...for decades, or in the case of bel canto...for 160 years and more ! And here we are required to pay our money-and receive instead of music, something close to penuriousness....cheap, stingy- regarding anything like an inventive, glorious, soaring emotive melodic line... or as Pagliaccio says in his beloved aria: ""Le gente paga, y ridi vuole qua"" -""The people pay, and laughter is what they want"".

I guess I am being unfairly critical. But when one's name is practically a household name...we expect extraordinary, don't we?

Any composer devoted to his life's work...if you want to be remembered, it would help a great deal if said composer wrote music that the gentry would adore for generations...these notes in this paltry piece so  randomly strung together , and sounding SO broadway musical...barely...is the best way I know of to be forgotten before you die.

It will not be helpful to angrily denounce the gentry for failing to undersand your ""genius"".  Just about any Italian opera will have you emerging from the performance dripping wet from your total immersion in music. It would seem that music, like paintings of the 20th century  has become ""shorthand""..scribblings, sketches on a napkin. To be thrown away. The real mystery is that there are
( suckers ) gentry who are duped into paying a million dollars for one of those scribblings. No what's wrong with that picture?",1328140800,3,3617,4.79903536977492

My Musical Theater Appreciation class and I were watching the DVD as part of our program in a larger than average screen and noticed that the look is indeed VHS-grain, not what a DVDs normally gives; a true pity. Then, when I pursued subtitles, there were none. How can you truly appreciate the genius of Sondheim without savoring his lyrics fully? After all, the CD releases come with a full libretto and lyrics, right?
In conclusion: cheaply produced.
Thus, we will have to wait untill someone wakes up with the cling of money (if not the artistic vision) and re-releases it, as it should, in Blueray.",1319155200,7,678,4.844827586206897

1010053,2,630530260X,"Are you someone who happened to see this production not knowing anything about it in advance and found it to be deadly dull, tedious and passionless with a completely forgetable (and forgotten) score?  Have you read all these rave reviews and felt afraid to give your own review because all the other reviewers can't be wrong and you don't want to look like an intellectual lightweight?

Well, don't be afraid.  The first thing to notice is how tiny the group of reviewers is, even compared to Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"" and ""Sweeney Todd.""  Most viewers have either been warned off this show or else didn't make it past the first fifteen minutes of this not very popular and commercially unsuccessful production.  Those who go against the grain and build this up as one of the greatest Broadway musicals want you to feel inferior to them.  If not for the always wonderful Bernadette Peters, who alone brings any life to the first act, I doubt that even half of the reviewers here could have made it through that first act.

And as for the score, could anyone seriously put this music in the same class as Show Boat, Porgy and Bess, South Pacific and West Side Story?  Check out here or on iTunes the number of artists who have covered even the supposedly more popular songs: ""Move On"" and ""Putting it Together.""  It's very close to zero.  No one wants to record the songs because they know that no one wants to listen to them.

Sondheim's problem is not that he can not write ""hummable"" songs.  His problem is that he is just another mediocre composer who can't write songs that people want to hear.  But a brilliant lyricist.  He should have stuck to that.

So don't be afraid to tell people what you really think of this musical:  that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes and you don't have to pretend that it's a great show just to go along with this small crowd.",1300147200,8,1870,4.553892215568863

And of course, this fictionalized play about the artist, George Seurat, is genius. It's not only one of Sondheim's best musicals; it's one of the best musicals of the twentieth century. The music is gorgeous--my favorite being ""We Do Not Belong Together""--the lyrics are intricate, and the story is very affecting. It's a very melancholy portrait of the artist as an isolated, obsessive man, cut off from the real world, and unable to connect with people--most importantly with his lover, Dot (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters).

The second act isn't as good as the first, but it puts the first act into some perspective. And you are unlikely to see another musical of this caliber on DVD. This is Broadway at its best; highly recommended to one and all.",1271980800,,1007,5.023952095808383

1010128,5,630530260X,"For those who know this musical, whether in its original cast version or its UK revival, the visceral beauty of the work will come as no surprise. It is the show that converted me to Stephen Sondheim, made me hungry to learn more about the mysterious, short-lived Georges Seurat and convinced me that Bernadette Peters can excel at any role she takes. Ironically, and even for the period during which it was produced, the video's color resolution could have been far better, since Seurat's pigments for La Grande Jatte paled over time, too. Still, this is a work of sublime beauty and fine performances. Composed in almost symphonic form with perfect casting and jaw-dropping stagecraft, it was worthy of the Pulitzer Prize it received. James Lapine's book is filled with moments of great warmth, rage and humor. It taps the universals in one story with grace and polish.

I will risk the consternation of those who believe the second act is a true cousin to the first. I do not. I would have preferred a slightly longer first act performed without break for two reasons. First, Act I tells  most of us a story about which we never knew. While the fictions Lapine injected into Act I were necessary -- we know so little about Seurat's reclusive life after all -- Act II speaks to us in large part about the callousness of the contemporary art market we already know. For a little while, the book falters, then recovers its footing about halfway through.

In an era of cerebral musicals and pale revivals, some of which hold up onstage but not on recordings, Sunday in the Park with George is one hell of a musical. It has everything we seek when we go to musical theater; and the video producers really gave it a go, creating the permanent document of a timeless work and an era that has passed. The cast is uniformly fine.

As one who completed an advanced degree in art history, I also have a special love for the painting and artist about whom the musical is based. In the subtext of Sondheim's work, then, is the admonition that we not forget these heroic figures, and that we pass their stories on to our children. I agree.

It is eternally frustrating that I cannot get to the centres to see his productions and have to content myself with recordings, or local productions, which are few and far between. These tapes of videoed stage productions are a godsend.
I have long known the music from ""Sunday in the Park"" and indeed have used certain parts for lectures to my students as they explain well and simply the act of creation. It then is extremely moving to see how this work was presented on stage, and in many ways the DVD has the advantage over seeing it in the theatre as one is able to get close-ups and change of view point. I am not a particular fan of Ms. Peters but her performance as Dot is exceptional, both spirited and touching.

'Color and Light', 'Finishing The Hat', 'Children and Art', and 'Sunday', are brilliant, and among some of the greatest songs (and most difficult to perform) ever written for musical theatre.

Specifically, I fell in love with the painting that it was based on--Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jette, by the pointellist painter, Georges Seurat (December 2, 1859 - March 29, 1891).  The pointellist movement was a bold and wonderful move on the part of this talented artist.  The style in which these pieces were painted was through a series of hundred of painted ""dots"" forming elaborate and colorful studies.  This beautiful musical brilliantly translates the themes and attitudes of Seurat's paintings.  The first half of the musical is devoted to Seurat (Mandy Patinkin) and his lover, Dot (Bernadette Peters), the inspiration for one of the characters in the famous painted park scene.  The second half follows Seurat's descendant, as he retraces the steps in the painter's life.  This is a wonderful, vivid and entertaining musical journey.  At age four, it was the one thing that motivated me to get on an airplane and travel to Chicago with my family, to at last see the marvelous painting that inspired the show--in the Chicago Museum of Art.

1010260,5,630530260X,"Every now and then you come across a work, say a movie, a book, a piece of music, which moves you so entirely, you will never look at life quite the same ever again. SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, the DVD, a staged production of the Stephen Sondheim, James Lapine Broadway musical is an unconventional show, sometimes more in the tradition of a Gilbert & Sullivan opera, in that the music is truly, as joked in the musical's book, 'variations on a theme'; one long sweep of music that climaxes in a powerful finale, bound to shake up the heart, and enlighten the mind.

The synopsis of the play is bound to chase some away, as it did me for many years. It is a fictional account of real life 19th Century Parisian artist, Georges Seurat, and his attempts to finish his masterwork, ""Sunday Afternoon On The Isle of La Grande Jatte"", as the Paris art community ridicules the work in progress, and stands defiantly against the finished piece. During Act 2, you are rudely whisked away 100 years into the future, where a monstrous piece of art; a metallic iron lung, shell-like object, is beaming laser beams and playing new age-like music to a less than enthusiastic crowd of artists and would-be admirers. It is the work of the great grandson of Georges Seurat, who faces the same doubt and betrayal from his peers.

The sad history of the artwork, brought to the front in a matter-of-fact way during a presentation during Act 2, in which aged daughter, (Bernadette Peters), and great grandson, (Mandy Pantinkin), recount the likes of Renoir and other famous painters of the era, retracting their entries into an art exhibit when it is learned, ""Sunday Afternoon On The Isle..."", would be included, brings characteristic emotional depth to the painting which is now regarded as a treasured piece of art, and indeed the painting is the star of the show, even taking a majestic bow during the closing curtain call.

It sounds dry, but this is all very light-hearted, with traditional musical comedy amusements, which surmount to a power sucker punch of sadness, humanity and beauty, as the cast gathers for the final song. Get out your handkerchiefs. The cast is exemplary; Mandy Pantinkin delivers an alarmingly spiritualized tenor proclaiming the beauty of art, sure to send shivers your way, and Bernadette Peters, is aglow with an empathetic characterization, full of conviction and grace, rarely realized in a musical.

Just a quibble.

This DVD is worth owning, not renting, because it is worth seeing repeatedly. Sondheim's scoring and lyrics are one reason; Patinkin and Bernadette Peters at their best is another, as is a flawless supporting cast. Certainly the second act, in which the same actors play reincarnated roles, is unique. (In the voice-over commentary, when Bernadette Peters plays 95-year-old Marie singing, ""Children and Art"", and her co-stars say, ""you didn't play this with makeup"", it is sort of a shock to realize that Ms. Peters did carry off this role with a minimum of makeup and a very real acting ability.)

(It's also a howl to hear ""Data"" -- Brent Spiner, here in his role as George's 20th Century electronics engineer -- tell George he was quitting, ""I'm going back to NASA, there's just too much pressure in this line of work!"")

Parents should probably pitch this to their kids as a very adult kind of production: ""adult"" in the manner of a very grown-up sensibility. George -- both the original 19th Century George Seurat and his 20th Century great-grandson -- feels a very adult yearning to create, to fulfill himself through his art. And, yes, art isn't easy, as they say in a well-staged number.

This was Sondheim at his best, and on a very blank canvas. So many possibilities ...",1123632000,,1410,4.746938775510204
1010268,5,630530260X,"I will forever be in the dark as to why anyone would dislike this piece of theater. So many times you hear about how ""cerebral"" and ""inaccesible"" Sondheim shows are. Is it so hard for people to think and feel at the same time?  The beauty of this piece is that it forces the audience to think about their relationship with art (either as an artist or a patron) and at the same time allows you to care for the characters deeply.  Alright, so you have to listen to it a few times before you really begin to ""get it."" This work allows you to witness an artist (considered a genius by many) who devotes himself competely to his work only to realize that he must do it at the expense of all of his other relationships.  From ""Beautiful,"" during which George tries but realizes it's too late to connect with his aging mother, to ""We Do Not Belong Together,"" when the love of his life tells him that she simply cannot be #2 anymore, I am not sure how anyone can watch these amazing moments and NOT be moved.

The score is haunting and the acting (except for a few moments that don't quite work from Mr. Patinkin) is astonishing.  It is a very risky choice having an opening number during which the soloist hardly moves, but Bernadette Peters draws you in from the start...brilliant acting. Perhaps the voices are not as ""perfect"" in the DVD as they are on the original soundtrack, but give me actors who are willing to sacrifice perfect vocal delivery for emotional content any day.  This production is one of my favorites and is essential for anyone interested in the artistic process.",1109548800,8,1579,4.465277777777778
1010348,5,630530260X,"I can't watch this DVD without crying. The story is incredibly compelling - I would think even more so to someone who is passionate about creativity and who loves art, musical theatre and exceptional writing.

This Pulitzer Prize winning play is a love story on many different levels.

It is about love for art, love for the product one is creating, love for the moment.

It is about making wrongs right, about coming full circle.

It is about the choices we make and the long lasting and far reaching ramifications of those choices.

Like someone said in an earlier review, this is not anything like ""Oklahoma!""

Bernadette Peters is incredible, Mandy Patinkin is passionate - at some points his face takes on such an enraptured quality I forget he ISN'T 19th Century George. I also enjoyed seeing the actor who played ""Jim"" on ""Murphy Brown"" as Jules, haughty art critic.

Secondly, the commentary provided by James Lapine (writer, director), Stephen Sondheim, (music and lyrics) and Peters and Patinkin is like getting an inside peek at the process they went through to bring this play to the stage.

I found myself yelling at Sondheim one time, though - as he interrupted right as Peters asked Lapine an especially wonderful question about Barbara Bryne's portrayal of George's mother and Sondheim spoke right over her.

I literally screamed at the TV set.

I couldn't help myself - I played the role in a local production and said to the Director ""James Lapine must have an interesting relationship with his mother, he writes such interesting mother roles.""

This is a DVD you should watch over and over and over to capture the many nuances and subtleties. And if you are a passionate artist, be sure to have Kleenex handy. You will recognize yourself in the story.",1106265600,8,1770,4.827814569536423
1010349,5,630530260X,"As someone who did not see the original production of SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, I am more grateful for this film of the stage play than I can possibly express. Although both Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin have both enjoyed fine careers in film and television in addition to their stage work, their best work has been on stage, and by the nature of the medium, it has been more or less lost to us. This performance captures them doing what they do best. It is ironic that with the semi-rebirth of the film musical in recent years, there has been no attempt to do so with Patinkin, the premiere musical stage performer of the past thirty years. Here he is a marvel, crafting songs with vocals stylings of an inconceivable range.

Sondheim's score is a thing of glory. Unlike many previous composers, Sondheim was concerned with making each song an organic part of the work as a whole. They don't stand alone, but absolutely require their setting in the rest of the musical. It is as if Sondheim wanted to make it impossible for any of them to be excerpted. Yet, each one is utterly remarkable, stamped with the highest possible craft and talent. What sets Sondheim's art apart from his fellow composers is the brilliance of his arrangements. He clearly has invested as much effort in arranging the music as he has in crafting the lyrics and writing the initial music. The arrangements are so hypnotic that at times I actually had to listen twice to a couple of musical numbers because I realized that I had failed to listen to the lyrics. The effect of the brilliant songs, the extraordinary performances, and the astonishing arrangements is absolutely breathtaking.

The cast is beyond reproach, with numerous stellar performances beyond those by Patinkin and Peters. Barbara Byrne, Dana Ivey, Charles Kimbrough, and many others perform their roles to perfection. Interestingly, shortly after the run of the musical was over, two of the cast members went on to major television stardom: Charles Kimbrough stood out as Jim Dial in MURPHY BROWN while Brent Spiner created one of the most beloved characters in television history as Data in STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.

In general, I have a low opinion of the stage musical. Most of them are more glitter and surface than substance, with superficially appealing music. SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, however, is one of the grand exceptions. The word ""genius"" is thrown around far too often, but it can be applied here with no impropriety.",1099094400,48,2501,4.811627906976744
1010350,4,630530260X,"Georges Seurat was totally insane by the age of 32.  Knowing that helps Stephen Sondheim's genius show through. Sunday in the Park with George is an amazing show about the life of this manic artist, and the fictional personalities of the figures in his painting ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"". The first Act is completely devoted to a set of Sundays spanning 2 years of Seurat's life and the end of his relationship with a long-time lover. The dramatic and touching songs make you feel for this hard-nosed painter yet comical points shine through. The second act takes place 100 years later in 1984 with the Great-grandson of Georges (also played by Mandy Patinkin) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his relative so much posthumous fame. Like other Sondheim shows it is at times long-winded, but altogether entirely enjoyable. Mandy and Mrs. Peters' voice have so much emotion and power that, with the correct sound system, you are carried to the brink of pure delight and insanity by their performances. With Commentary from the actors and producers this is an essential for one who collects musicals.",1097971200,4,1136,4.8860103626943
1010351,5,630530260X,"In the theatre SUNDAY baffled some, and enthralled others.  The TV version (taped the week after the show closed in the Booth theatre where it played for 604 performances) is a beautiful transfer from stage to(small)screen.

The sensitive performances, the delicate orchestrations, Tony Staiges Tony Award winning scenery, James Lapine's Pulitzer prize winning writing and Stephen Sondheim's deceptively beautiful score all combine to make this something very special.

Perhaps a little too special: SUNDAY lost the 1984 Tony award to LA CAGE AUX FOLLES - an enjoyable yet conventional musical comedy (HELLO DOLLY! in drag) - and most of the initial reviews were unfavourable.  But the show had its supporters and continued to attract audiences and even some of the critics who disliked the show at first later reversed or at least ""clarified"" their opinions.

Truth be told, SUNDAY is a rich piece and it is just not possible to penetrate all its layers in a single vieweing.

The DVD allows viewers a chance to study, to consider, and yes, even question both the show and the painting that inspired it. Is that really a baby carriage? Why a monkey? How is the flower in the hat made to have such a shimmering violet color?

The show contains sequences that do not in any way resemble standard musical theatre: The long number ""The Day off"" or even more startling, ""It's Hot Up Here!"" are in no way ""standard"" showtunes in 4/4 time. If anything, it is actually more like a chamber opera, but then labels are irrelevant.

SUNDAY tells a tale of artistic creation.  The artist makes many sacrifices in his quest to ""finish the hat."" This DVD makes the case exceptionally well, with a fascinating commentary by Sondheim, Lapine, Peters and Patinkin.  Yes, Mandy is a hyper person and he does try to dominate the proceedings but Sondheim corrects him on some facts -politely but firmly - and in spite of it all you sense that all four look back on their time creating the show as a very special time in their lives and remain enormously proud of their accomplishment.",1096934400,20,2064,4.838068181818182

Even some songs seem out of place. But buying this DVD will clear them all up. I agree with some of the reviewers that Mandy Patinkin overacts. His hand movements are a bit too drastic sometimes. In the Audio Commentary he basically dominates the conversation. But his vocals and his deliverance are great. Bernadette Peters is most likely the greatest actress alive. In the second act, when she becomes marie, she plays the role to perfection. The supporting cast is great as well. The funniest line (and a catchphrase of mine), is when the boatman is supposed to be giving directions to the Americans who think He cannot understand english. ""Why don't you just walk into the water until your lungs fill up and you die"". LOL. He should have won a Tony for that. This whole show should have won a Tony, Not ""La Cage Aux Follies"".

1010353,5,630530260X,"SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE was one of the first Sondheim collaborations with Lapine, and it remains a classic of the stage.  Here you get the original cast including Many Patinkin and Bernadette Peters captured for a PBS GREAT PERFORMANCES.  The camerawork is tight on them, and you see every nuance in their faces, and even get glimpses of what Mandy is drawing as he plays Seraut in the first act.  Some people find this one hard to relate to, and of the three available on DVD that is probably true.  PASSION and INTO THE WOODS deal with easier subject matter, and have more elaborate staging to work with.  But this is still a handsome production filled with vituoso performances of classic songs such as ""Tipping the Hat"" and ""Sunday"".  That it is a difficult musical shouldn't stop you by any means.  Like a fine wine it grows on you and warms you the more you imbibe.  The best part of the DVD is the commentary featuring both lead actors, Sondheim, and Lapine.  Mandy Pantinkin seems to dominate the discussion, but all chime in to reveal what a personal labor of love it was for all involved.  Sondheim's biggest revelation is that he originally intended George to be played by a BASS, and was skeptical of Mandy in the role!  Bernadette Peters good-heartedly remembers all the cast member names, and recalls many backstage stories centered on the performance.  Mandy seems most concerned with telling you about auditioning, and developing his ""dog"" voices.  Lapine talks of how dialogue became songs and vice versa.  It's a great track, and gives you insight into the show that will make you appreciate it that much more. And as a side note ... why all the problems with Act 2?  ""Move On"", ""Children and Art"", and ""Putting It Together"" are some of the most moving songs and moments in the show.  The idea that a love can last generations!  Sigh!

1010354,5,630530260X,"Though perhaps the later Passion was a greater Sondheim-Lapine collaboration, their first work - Sunday in the Park with George - remains a sensitive and delicate piece that merits contemplation.  It was preserved on video, and the preservation is generally solid.  The film work generally manages to capture where the audience attention would best be, and in such a visual show it does as well as film may to transcribe the essence.
Sunday... is one of Sondheim's most pleasant scores for listening; it has a grace and majesty that mark it above much of his other work.  It is fortunately combined with a witty book and excellent direction on Lapine's part.  The central character of the first act, Georges Seurat, is portrayed with a certain distance and coldness by Mandy Patinkin that many consider off-putting; I think that this is more directorial bias than actor's intent, and Patinkin's work was indeed among his best here.  His romantic counterpart Dot is played with elegance and style by Bernadette Peters, at the prime of her career and in fine acting style.  The second act's George is a much more relatable character, and I think that Patinkin's portrayal here is much more likeable and enjoyable.  His work in ""Putting it Together"" alone is a masterpiece; Patinkin truly took the task of making two roles work.  Peters is understated, but well acted, until the finale where she is marvellous.  And the actual finale will raise more questions than it answers...for the show is really all about whether we choose to create children or art...in other words, romantic love or artistic devotion?  This is the question George must face, as Seurat faced it, and learn where his answer lies.
The ensemble parts are amazing.  Fans can look for virtuoso performances by the likes of Brent Spiner and Charles Kimbrough.  Everyone takes on the challenge of two different roles, two different worlds, and does so as gracefully and well as the leads.  The result is a marvellous show that is sadly not produced all that much; the presence of the DVD record, though, makes up for it generously.  It cannot be missed by any fan of serious musicals.",1056758400,,2147,4.895027624309392

Several unobtrusive video glitches, and audio derived from the performers' body mics and close miking in the pit reveal the tape was made as a document of the show rather than as a ""movie"". A few instances of low-level audio ""pre-echo"" remind us this was made before digital production was common.
The 1999 commentary track is Sondheim, Lapine, Peters and Patinkin viewing the video sans sound and talking about the development of the show in workshop and onto Broadway.  Good enough reason to get the DVD even if you have a tape of the PBS ""American Playhouse"" presentation of years ago.
The performance reflects the passion of the production, the range and power of the emotions spoken through the music and talent of the actors clearly coming through the minor shortcomings of the recording - this *is* the production I saw in 1984.

The prop designer must have had his work cut out with those cut outs. Especially with those cutouts of Mandy Patinkin. I'll bet that in other productions of this show, they have to make cutouts of the person who is playing George. It was a bit boring, the show. The girl who plays Louise was sassy in her painting costume. She had beautiful shoulders. If only George Seurat lived today and Louise was in a bikini.

I had been warned that the movie - a fictional story about Georges Seurat and his legacy (I say this because only the first act is really about him; the second act is made possible by the first, though) - was nothing like seeing the actual show live, and was somewhat dull.  But I had to see it.
It was not dull.  I found it very enjoyable in fact.  Mandy Patinkin is his usual fanatical self - which should work, considering he's playing an artist, and it does for most of the time, but he occasionally is just too ""Mandy.""  Bernadette Peters is amazing, and her performance is much less affected than it is in Into The Woods, when she does some just-for-the-audience, out-of-character ""cutesy"" things that get on my nerves.  She plays Dot (Seurat's lover) perfectly, capturing her ""averageness"" and yet also her extraordinariness.
I also liked James Lapines' script in this, even more than I did his script for Into The Woods.
The show doesn't look like I imagined it while listening to the CD, although this is not necessarily a bad thing. The music is beautiful, performances are great, but it - well, it could have been even better - which is not to say that it is not amazing now.
If you love the CD (anybody who loves musicals - especially ones by Stephen Sondheim - MUST buy it), then I recommend this movie.",1001203200,5,1385,4.52
1010411,5,630530260X,"IMO, a superlative combination of performance, stagecraft and songwriting. The story brings into high relief the paradox of artist worship- Dot loves George most of all for his painting, to be immortalized in his medium. The obsession that makes George's art so great is the very thing that prevents him from giving her what she really needs: commitment, connection.
The music, while lacking the catchy, hummable tunes of mainstream Broadway, tellingly evokes Seurat's Divisionist painting style and limns the jarring temporal dislocations of the stage effects and scene transitions.
The video may not have the gloss and precision of the original cast recording, but brings more strongly characterized and muscular performances from the cast and orchestra, vividly highlighting the brilliant orchestration. Patinkin's Seurat is more masculine, more French; Peters serves up her dialogue more naturally. The DVD commentary gives some interesting insights into the creation of this work, and shows a revealing portrait of the principals- Patinkin intense, passionate, narcissistic; Peters charming, laid-back, but somewhat less intellectually engaging.
Highlights for me include the splendid opening number, the remarkable blending of song, dialogue and musical illustration in ""Color and Light"" and ""Finishing the Hat"", the rich didactics of ""Beautiful"" and ""Children and Art"". A real connoisseur's piece!",1000339200,6,1404,5.820388349514563
1010412,4,630530260X,"""Sunday In the Park With George"" is a fascinating and very moving study on how thrilling but hard the life of an artist can be: how exciting, frusturating but ultimately rewarding the journey toward ""getting through to something new"" is, and also how painful it is to sacrifice an emotional connection in personal relationships in order to do so.  Stephen Sondheim's score is, as usual, the heart of the show; although it is often fragmented and dissonant, much like the pointillist style of Georges Seurat (the French painter whose life and attempts to create the painting ""A Sunday Afternoon On the Island of La Grande Jette"" are the focus of the first half of the show) and like many of SOndheim's other scores, it still is highly emotional and moving and there are songs of incredible beauty such as ""Finishing the Hat,"" ""Sunday,"" and ""Children and Art.""  There are also some highly delightful moments such as the title song, ""The Day Off,"" in which Georges imitates not one but two dogs, and ""Everybody Loves Louis,"" as well as a final lovely moment of inspiration in ""Move On.""  While the actual dialogue between the chracters is rather wooden, James Lapine's book on the whole does almost as good a job as Sondheim does of exploring the good and bad facets of an author's life and also has many colorful ideas on what the many people in the ""La Grande Jette"" painting might have been like.  This taping of a performance of the original Broadway production, with almost all of the original cast, is a very valuable record of Lapine's highly effective direction, the fascinating set, and the wonderful performances which should be cherished.  While frankly Mandy Patankin (As Seurat and, in the second act, his confused lasermaker-sculptor great-grandson) and Bernadette Peters (As Seurat's beautiful but frusturated mistress Dot and, in Act 2, their elderly child and Patankin's gradnmother!) were both in better voice on the original cast album, but still they both do wonderfully in both their roles; Peters in particular shines.  The supporting cast (All of whom play two roles in each act) is also great, with particular standouts being Barbara Bryne and Dana Ivey in the first act, and Brent Spiner in the second.  All in all a wonderful record of one of Sondheim's most personal and affecting shows.  Highly recommended!",1000166400,3,2332,4.9311224489795915

When I was in High School, my Theatre teacher (who I'll leave anonymous, as I haven't asked his permission to use his name) had us study this piece in extreme depth.  He had us write our own stories for the painting, and then had us read through the first act and say how we'd write the second.  Then he had us go through in excruciating detail and start picking out the nitty-gritty of what was in the script.  GOOD LORD--there's more there than should rightfully fit in something twice as long.  I fell in love with the work before we were even half finished.

1010416,5,630530260X,"What amazes me most about this production is that it is intensely visual at the same time it is phenomenal to listen to. Both the music and the images support the story and recreate George Seurat's famous painting. Very little is known about Seurat's life, so this biographical piece takes great liberties. But it is a stunning show.
As George creates his work, the audience is introduced to the figures in the painting. Young girls, soldiers, servants, nurses, mothers and artists are developed as characters before coming together for the final tableau. At this point, a screen with the painting drops in front of the stage, showing how perfectly the scene was recreated.
The emotional theme of the show is the story between George (Mandy Patinkin, fabulous as always), who is obsessed with his work, and Dot (Bernadette Peters), his often-ignored lover. The pair truly love eachother, but George's work and his inability to express his feelings get in the way.  ""Finishing the Hat"" and ""Move On"" are two songs/scenes that beautifully show the characters emotions. The actors come back when the show flips to modern day -- as a new artist named George and his grandmother Marie (the child of Dot and the original George). And the younger George learns new lessons from the failures of Dot and the older George.
Musically and lyrically, Sondheim perfectly captures the emotions of the characters and the painting itself. ""Red, red, red, red, red, red, orange, red, red, orange..."" George sings while he works. The staccato words and music evoke the pointilistic style of the painting itself. Incredible! (But, what else would one expect of Sondheim?)
Highlights to watch for: ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."" a hilariously ignorant couple of American tourists. ""WE...ARE...LOST!"" they say to the French, while making huge gestures.

I was kind of lost in the first act...but then things  started to pick up. The set is a character in the show, in itself, it moves  the story along and makes it funner to watch. This is classic Sondheim,  though I will admit that I have seen better from Mr. Sondheim. Although  Patinkin is the main squeeze in this production, I feel like Peters carried  the show on her back. She was uterly amazing. Do we expect anything less  from her? My favorite song in the show is, of course, MOVE ON! It speaks to  you. This is just one of the best songs in the whole video. I love the last  few lines of the song, ""Anything you do, let it come from you. Then it  will be new. Give us more to see."" That is soooo profound if you think  about it.",965001600,,1049,4.053658536585366
1010481,5,630530260X,"Sondheim's reportoire spans the most ambitious projects ever attempted in the muiscal theater canon. In ""Sunday,"" he tackles art itself, and the obsession of the artist, through the semi-fictionalized accounts of  pointillist painter George Seurat and his great-grandson. The show is not  without flaws (the Act I/ Act II transition is a bit jarring), but there is  really nothing remotely as wonderful as the score and emotion which  underlies it. The score sounds better on the cast recording (Several cast  members had voice problems when the video was made, and the chorus work is  a bit muted), but the energy is still there, and the finales  (""Sunday"") are perhaps the most spine-tingling moments in musical  theater history, as ""Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte"" takes  shape before the audience. This may well be the most personal of Sondheim's  work, and if ""Children and Art"" doesn't bring a tear, then you  must have a heart of stone. A splendid editing job makes this video a  must-have for any fan of musical theater.",959904000,2,1033,4.976608187134503
1010482,5,630530260X,"When I heard the original CD of this show I felt lost and confused; the music seemed bland, the story and characters were confusing-so I gave up on it. However, watching the show on DVD had me riveted to the seat with  intense awe like a great movie.
The whole show, to me, was about choices  and chosing (two seperate things). It is about why George chose the people,  style and sacrafices in his painting ""La Grand Jatte"" and how the  choices made affected his life and if they were wrong or right. And while  George had choices to make about the painting, Dot had choices to make  about George and their life (act 1) and George (II) had choices to make  about his fledging art life (act 2).
The concept also gave an insight to  art appreciation. Since no one really knows if the people in the painting  are related to Seurat, we are shown how to believe they may be. What is the  painting about?
The DVD production is wonderful. Great picture, sound,  cast, design...!
This is a 5 star story and will no doubt be watched  again and again by me.",957916800,3,1047,4.34020618556701
1010483,5,630530260X,"The story of _Sunday in the Park with George_ is unusually inaccessible for a Sondheim work.  Unlike most of his mass-appeal pieces, such as _Phantom of the Opera_, this is a playwright's play.  To be sure it's  comprehensible by everyone, but I suspect those who would get the most out  of it would be fellow artists.  Far from being a plot driven work, this is  the exploration of an idea, a work ethic, a raison d'etre.
Inasmuch  as there is a  plot, it is the story of how art is produced.  It is a  struggle delivered against the backdrop of a single family's history.  As  we are shown each generation in the family, we discover how the struggle to  produce great work often estranges loved ones, and  how the need to be paid  often alienates the artist from his own work.
It is a fascinating ride,  but it is all about character, details, subtle observation, and the angst  of artistic creation.  Some people don't like such work, so if you're one  of these, you might want to rent before buying.
However, if you're even  slightly artistically inclined, you will come away from this story  enriched. You will also find much to laugh about here.  The work is full of  interesting characters, and surprising character actors.  Brent Spiner and  Charles Kimbrough put in amusing performances before ""Star Trek: The Next  Generation"" and ""Murphy Brown"" made them television stars.
But I think  the most fascinating thing about this work is its set design.  I'm not sure  I've ever seen a production with better use of scrim.  The stage literally  becomes an artist's canvas, with bits of scenery flying in and out as  needed by Patinkin's character.  It is a masterwork of design and anyone  studying stagecraft has to make a stop here.
Likewise, anyone  interested in the business side of Broadway production will find the audio  commentary on the DVD especially intriguing.  Hearing how the production  came together is entirely instructive.  Also, there aren't too many DVD  audio commentaries which include major actors, so the presence of Mandy  Patinkin and Bernadette Peters here is altogether welcome.  Perhaps because  there was such a time gap between the play and the audio commentary (more  than ten years), the participants have had time to think about the  experience and put it in historical perspective.  As a result,  this audio  commentaries is one of the very best I've yet encountered on DVD.
It  may be more interesting than the play itself.",954288000,2,2465,4.824096385542169
1010484,4,630530260X,"'Beautiful does not...'
This is more than a pretty play.  There is a significance, sophistication and depth in this musical that goes well beyond what you would expect.  Every time I have had the opportunity to  catch this musical on HBO or PBS I have taken it - it has been well worth  seeking out.
This story is a complete work of fiction that centres around  the life of the painter.  It's not really about the painter, or about the  painting.  It's about art.  It's about the art of making art.  It's about  the search for significance and meaning to our lives.  It's about  connecting with the world around you.  It's about living life for all it's  worth, with all you've got, and not settling for the mediocre or  second-best.  It's about standing back from the dots that make up our lives  and looking how it all fits together, allowing the perspective (or lack)  fall into its proper place.
This DVD is worth obtaining for two reasons.  First, you WILL want to watch this over and over, and review it from time  to time.  Because you have changed between viewings, the play will say  different things to you.  Second is the commentary with James Lapine who  wrote the libretto, Stephen Sondheim who scored the music, and Mandy  Patinkin and Bernadette Peters.  There are times where the commentary goes  completely quiet, which is sometimes confusing (I would have preferred if  they spoke through the whole thing, and I can't tell if the recording  equipment failed to record some parts, or if they were really silent. This  is a minor complaint, and I'm still very happy to have this DVD.)
I have  recommended this movie to many friends, of different backgrounds, and with  a few exceptions most have come away with many reasons (often different  from my own) as to why they enjoyed and were touched by the play.",947289600,30,1823,4.646687697160884
1010485,5,630530260X,"Stephen Sondheim.  James Lapine.  Put these two names together,and you know that you are in for some heavy, moving, and unforgettablemusical theatre.  Being the first of three collaborations between the two men (along with the touching/important ""ITW"" and lustful/macabre ""Passion), I must say that Sunday in the Park With George is, in fact, their masterpiece (and my favorite musical as well).
Now let me start off by saying that if you would have asked me about this musical three years ago, I would have told you that I hated it; But that was when, of course, I had little knowledge of theatre and was hung onto musicals like Rent (that is a brilliant piece in itself--but i was drawn in merely by the score--not the meaning or spectacle).  Now, I am an 18-year-old freshman at Indiana U and within those past three years, have grown to learn so much about the musical theatre and the unmatchable music and lyrics of Stephen Sondheim.  I share my thoughts on this musical with you.
Based on an the brilliant painting ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"" by the then ridiculed, now praiseworthy Georges Seurat, Sondheim has written a truly unforgettable score which contains such unique orchestrations and the finest of instruments and vocal demands.  Lapine's gorgeous creation of bringing life to each of the featured people in the painting only adds pure serendipity and brilliance to Sondheim's music and lyrics. How the first act carefully concentrates on setting up the second act, we are introduced to the two major roles of the piece: the artist, Georges Seurat, and his fictional mistress, Dot.  We are then taken into the lives of the colored ensemble as they spend their Sundays in the park.  Wondering how each individual ends up in that famous pose for the painting is brought to our attention at the first act's conclusion (which is perhaps one of the finest Act I finales ever produced in the musical theatre).  The second act takes place 100 years later and gives us hints of mystery, inspiration, determination, and elation as we all feel uplifted after the second act finale.
Although I'm not a huge Mandy Patinkin fan, he does more than suffice in the dual role of both Georges Suerat/George.  This role really does suit this actor well and it is said by many to be his most accomplished work.
Bernadette Peters on the other hand is an absolute Godsend.  This woman not only has to portray a somewhat naive, heartbreaking, and adorable young mistress in the first act, but a 98 year old grandmother in the second act.  Not only can she pull it off to the point that her acting is extraordinarily believable, but she also has to change from one to character to the other in a matter of minutes.  How she does this, and allowing the audience to buy this flawless performance is beyond me. I recently had the honor of seeing Stephen Sondheim speak at the St. Louis Jewish Center on November 7th.  He said that this is the piece of theatre which opened Bernadette Peters' acting range in the musical theatre.  Sunday in the Park with George is what really gave Bernadette that mastery craft of acting--and you know something?  I couldn't agree with the genius more.
The rest of the cast is splendid as each take on dual roles from the 1884 generation to the 1984 generation.  From the haunting ""Beautiful"" to the harshness reality of ""Putting it Together"" to the awe-inspiring ""Move On""--this piece of theatre is without a doubt, a masterpiece within a masterpiece.
Lapine's direction could not have been any more carefully thought out or more intelligent; the performers couldn't have portrayed their roles any better; and Sondheim could not have written a more gifted score than that which is given to us in the Pulitzer Prize winning Sunday in the Park With George.",945043200,6,3803,4.790519877675841
