8168072,2,B000MDZ1BI,"I just finished watching The Outer Space Connection. It's a fantastical projection of extrapolations that exceeds anything I've ever watched. The number of what ifs, ifs, could it be possibles, perhaps, it might be, we don't know, Dr. so & so believes & such statements are legion. Yet it appears to pass itself off as a scientifically based show. You'd have to extend a degree of faith exceeding religion to buy into this as a whole & parts are so factually in error it's amazing. Still if you're into sci-fi & not science then this could potentially be your bag of tricks. Just don't question the words you're hearing & everything will be fine. I'm not claiming that the producers or narrator (Rod Serling of The Twight Zone fame) are trying to purposely deceive the viewer. Just that they have assumed an extrapolative prognostication & cast it as science. I have little patience with that. The questions they raise are valid, the answers are far less so. Just in case you're wondering I do believe in life outside of our planet & that we aren't the highest intellect in the universe. That is about all I share with the creators of this show however. Given the factual errors we should ask how many others of those hundred ifs are wrong too. 2.5 out of 5 Amazon Stars.",1379548800,2,1271,4.60352422907489

8168075,3,B000MDZ1BI,"This film marks the birth of ideas such as, alien adduction, alien experimentation, and alien conspiracy. It also give rise to such films and TV show as, Close Encounter of The Third Kind, Fire in the Sky, and most important, The X-Files. It took me a while to track this film down. A not too bad transfer of film-to-VHS-to-DVD is given me all sorts of flash backs from my ""younger"" years in the mid to late seventies.

The Outer Space Connection is the hallmarks of the 1970's, with its heavy pseudo-science overtone to its otherworldly soundtrack which I find very soothing. One has to be a ""true believer"" to take stock of anything this documentary has to say, but it won't hurt to put up one's mumbo-jumbo filter in your mind as you watch this film. I love the
narration of Rod Serling, his authoritative voice lend some credence to the documentary. Also, the creepy atmosphere the film presented is not too bad either. The subject of movie wandered from outer space alien to alien outer space travel to alien human experimentation, to
communication with other specie of animals towards the end of the movie.

If you're a X-Files fan then you must have it in your library, agent Mulder sure has.",1192752000,2,1199,4.650943396226415
