6383520,3,B00JPFTPDY,The usual Robin Williams type humor.  The biggest drawback for me is the profanity used continuously throughout the entire movie.  The movie would be the same without any of it. It's just not necessary.,1401148800,3,202,4.911764705882353
6383521,4,B00JPFTPDY,"Hollywood always tries and puts out the best clips for trailers. I was excited for this movie, from the first time I seen one. Its unfortunate that this won't be in theaters, nationwide, but just as well will be well received on demand and on the internet.

This movie answers the question that we all have been asked: What would you do if you knew you were going to die.
The answer is well written, in the movie, in an epiphany type of moment.

Its a great ensemble cast, that compliment each other, and I would definitely suggest taking 90 minutes to watch this movie.

Amazon wouldn't let me but I'd give it 3 1/2 starts, not the 4 that shows.",1401062400,21,646,4.322314049586777
6383532,5,B00JPFTPDY,Found this movie to be funny and quite enlightening.  How ironic that this was the last movie Robin Williams did.  Pulls on your heart strings while being funny at the same time.  Loved Mila Kunis.,1486944000,,197,4.571428571428571
6383533,2,B00JPFTPDY,Nor very good,1485302400,,13,3.6666666666666665

6383535,5,B00JPFTPDY,"I saw this movie for the first time, it is a dark comedy for sure.  It's crazy, far fetched, but it does give one pause to evaluate their own life. His birth and death year 1951 - 2014 were the same in real life and this movie.  Still hard to believe he is gone.  All and all this is far fetched, but worth seeing, especially if you are a Robin Williams fan.",1480982400,,358,3.9444444444444446
6383536,5,B00JPFTPDY,"A very good movie, especially for people that have experienced loss thus follows anger.",1478563200,,87,5.285714285714286
6383537,5,B00JPFTPDY,I love Robin Williams movies and this one did not disappoint me.  Very funny,1478217600,,76,4.428571428571429

6383539,5,B00JPFTPDY,This is such a good movie. I couldn't help but laugh almost the whole way through because it depicts my father in law every day attitude.,1477008000,,137,4.3076923076923075
6383540,1,B00JPFTPDY,"Couldn't watch the entire movie. It wasn't very good. This was one of Robin Williams' last movies and I wanted to see it. His character was quite angry indeed. No one is that angry all of the time and rude to boot. The doctor chased him all around the place (not likely), to correct some misinformation and get him to the hospital. When she located him, she couldn't dial 911? Goofy.
I was disappointed.",1473638400,,403,4.45945945945946

6383554,3,B00JPFTPDY,"Always enjoy Robin Williams in a lead role, now that he's gone it's even harder to watch because I tend to view his movies from the perspective of his sad death. This is pretty good, although seeing him as a miserable human being is a stretch. But his acting skills shine through. I liked it.",1473120000,,292,4.327272727272727

6383582,5,B00JPFTPDY,Heart warming and interesting plot.,1471824000,,35,6.2
6383583,4,B00JPFTPDY,"The ""90 minutes before death"" misdirection from Dr. Gill under pressure from the patient pales in comparison to the Reno dentifraud who prescribed a drug known to cause ""patient death"" via excruciatingly painful colonitis for purposes of appointing a *posthumous* spouse to claim my estate after his pretended ""antibiotic"" killed me.  Also pales in comparison to the 250,000 Americans per year who are ""wrongfully killed"" by medifraud malpractice or the felony religionist polytackyun Jeb Bush's insistence that Terry Schiavo's long since brain dead cadaver be subjected to torture for years for purposes of gutting and looting the ""malpractice insurance"" paid after the medifrauds originally killed her.  In this film, however, that misdirection allowed ""The Angriest Man"" to do the life relevant things that he wanted to get done before dying later than misdirected.  The emphasis of the film was on living whatever time one has in the ways most relevant to oneself.  Well played, photographed, and produced.",1471564800,,1010,5.414012738853503

6383606,5,B00JPFTPDY,Another great role by The Late Robin Williams,1469145600,,45,4.75
6383607,5,B00JPFTPDY,"I loved this movie, in light of Robin Williams death, it touch the heart. It was emotional, riveting, and crude. but all in all it gave almost closure to the death of Robin Williams (not saying this is his story) just a bit of peace knowing that he could still be both serious and funny even in his final weeks. This is to say that the irony of the movie involving a man who dies played by a man who has died.",1468972800,,409,4.0

6383610,4,B00JPFTPDY,Considering how he died there is more truth here about Mr. Williams than anyone knew. This is not his usual comic movie. But a very good picture of his inner life. RIP,1467763200,,167,4.25

6383623,5,B00JPFTPDY,"This movie gets 5 stars for the simple fact that the story line could occur to any one of us at any time. Filled with laughter, anger, grief, regret, and normal family drama...this film is relatable and heart warming.",1466899200,,217,4.589743589743589

6383627,2,B00JPFTPDY,Weird movie...depressing...makes you wonder if this aided in the decision for Robin Williams to kill himself.,1466035200,,109,5.875

You can relate to some of it",1465948800,,34,3.375
6383629,5,B00JPFTPDY,"Great movie shows life is too short to let anger or sorrow rule/run your life.  Not only does it pushed loved ones, and people in general, away, but can reek even more havoc on your overall health and well-being.",1465948800,,212,4.435897435897436
6383630,4,B00JPFTPDY,Cute movie. One of Robin Williams last films.,1465430400,,45,4.75
6383631,5,B00JPFTPDY,"Wonderfully written, with poignant performances.",1465430400,,48,8.8
6383642,5,B00JPFTPDY,One of the best movies Robin Williams made.,1465257600,,43,4.5
6383643,3,B00JPFTPDY,"Not Robin Williams' best but was still good enough for three stars.  The script may have been all over the map as the story line had numerous twists.
Don't watch this if you are offended by foul language..",1465257600,,205,4.394736842105263
6383644,4,B00JPFTPDY,Williams is unusually angry in this yet still lovable.,1465257600,,54,5.111111111111111
6383645,4,B00JPFTPDY,"Well I'm f***in' depressed meow.  Classic Robin Williams make's you feel good about life while bumming you out (see Jack or that teacher movie).  Good flick overall, some of the relationships feel forced tho.",1465171200,,208,5.088235294117647
6383646,3,B00JPFTPDY,Could have been better,1464739200,,22,4.75
6383647,5,B00JPFTPDY,"I laughed; I cried. In sum, this movie moved me. While the premise and some of the plot developments maybe were over-the-top, the relationships felt real. I was rooting for everybody. I'll watch this again some day. Thanks to all involved in making this, especially the director, the writers, Robin Willams, Mila Kunis, Melissa Leo, and Peter Dinklage.",1464134400,,352,5.086206896551724
6383648,4,B00JPFTPDY,"I enjoyed this movie.  It is Robin Williams in a non-comedic role with comedy undertones.  Mila Kunis (who I don't normally care for) was interesting as a young doctor whose life is going downhill and she makes a stupid mistake.  Robin Williams did wonderfully as a man who is angry at life and everyone in it, after tragically losing a child.  The movie is dark, but uplifting.",1463875200,,378,4.597014925373134
6383649,5,B00JPFTPDY,sweet movie with a great cast. the subject matter is prolific given William's passing just one year later. It's not Dead Poets and maybe it's because I miss William's acting and comedic talents but still an enjoyable movie with a great message.,1463702400,,244,4.833333333333333
6383650,5,B00JPFTPDY,We really enjoyed this one.,1463529600,,27,4.6
6383651,4,B00JPFTPDY,"A deep look into the psyche of Robin Williams soon before his death. If he got as into his characters as many have said, this movie explains a lot about his suicide. Plus it was a good movie too, but depressing knowing what we now know.",1462838400,,236,4.1521739130434785
6383652,2,B00JPFTPDY,Not the best,1462752000,,12,3.3333333333333335
6383653,1,B00JPFTPDY,I like Robin Willams but he has a few movies I don't like and this is one.,1462752000,,74,3.411764705882353

6383656,4,B00JPFTPDY,"Robin Williams was excellent. Academy Award winning  performance! Some parts were amazingly well done..others not appropriate or relevant to story line. Felt like they should have kept it simple, straight forward ..they played with his character too much.
It was entertaining..overall",1462233600,,284,5.926829268292683
6383657,3,B00JPFTPDY,It was OK. I probable would not watch it again.,1462233600,,47,3.8

6383677,5,B00JPFTPDY,loved it,1461024000,,8,3.5
6383678,3,B00JPFTPDY,It's a good indie movie but not a memorable one. The female lead does a nice job. I think the really positive reviews are for sentimental reasons.,1461024000,,146,4.444444444444445
6383679,4,B00JPFTPDY,It was a little disturbing considering the way Robin left us...but he was a special talent and I watch him in almost anything!,1459382400,,126,4.521739130434782
6383680,5,B00JPFTPDY,I like every movie I have seen Robin Williams in.  This movie had a good story line and I would watch it again and recommend it to others.,1459296000,,138,3.9285714285714284

6383692,4,B00JPFTPDY,I liked the movie - found it entertaining but sad even though it was listed as comedy. It was indeed funny in parts but it had the heavy subject matter of dying and trying to make up for all the relationship rifts in a short amount of time. Robin Williams is brilliant as always. I did enjoy it the movie even though I had to wipe a few tears away.,1459209600,,348,3.9857142857142858

It may not work for everyone but it works for me to view it again and again as a way to let go of my anger.

6383726,4,B00JPFTPDY,Interesting movie.  Notable that this was Robin Williams very last movie he was involved with.  You can see the turmoil that he personally was going through even then.  Remarkable that he practically predicted his own demise with this movie.

6383728,5,B00JPFTPDY,"The movie itself isn't funny. It sends a powerful message in regards to how we waste our life instead of things we should be doing and accomplishing in case we die in 90 minutes.
But the scene where he is buying a camera recording device in a shop makes me want to laugh with tears every time I rewatch it. One of the most funniest moments of the entire movie.",1456617600,,360,4.1571428571428575

6383764,3,B00JPFTPDY,"In the wake of Williams's suicide, it's difficult not to view THE ANGRIEST MAN IN BROOKLYN as a piece where truth and fiction have unwittingly come together.

The basic scenario is one that has been well explored in past comedies: Henry Altmann (Williams) is told by his doctor Sharon Gill (Mila Kunis) that he has ninety minutes left on this earth, and resolves to pack as many things into that space of time as he can. Unfortunately his best-laid plans go wrong; his wife Bette (Melissa Leo) hates him, his son Tommy (Hamish Linklater) hasn't spoken to him for two years, and his childhood friend Bix Field (Richard Kind) has an argument with him over an incident occurring four decades previously when both were at school. Henry's main problem is that he cannot help but get angry at any and every little thing, which prevents him from understanding either himself or others.

The narrative unfolds as a chase, with the doctor desperately trying to find Henry and explain things, but Henry proves fascinatingly elusive. There are some very funny set pieces, especially one in a store where Henry tries to purchase a video camera from Ruben (James Earl Jones).

In the end the movie becomes a little overwhelmed with gushy sentiment, as the doctor and Henry meet up and things get worked out. Nonetheless there is still time for a hilarious piece of trading racist insults involving Henry, the doctor, and an Uzbek taxi driver (Daniel Raymont).

Ingeniously structured round parallel voice-overs, with Williams and Kunis telling about each other's lives, their past, present and futures. THE ANGRIEST MAN IN BROOKLYN is worth watching, despite the saccharine moral.",1450483200,,1667,4.985611510791367
6383765,4,B00JPFTPDY,"Robin Williams finds out he will die soon from a brain aneurism and spends the movie trying to do the right last things.

The Robin Williams character lets out his anger at those things that all of us at one time or another have wanted to express to the world. The movie asks the question ""If you have only 90 minutes to live, what would you do with that 90 minutes? What are the most important things to you? Are you sure?""

6383955,2,B00JPFTPDY,"It is unfortunate that Robin Williams last body of work was so weak. While his great gift was standup comedy, he was a truly fine actor, as some of his early works highlight. His later material, like this one, is weak in the comedy department, and weak in the acting department. Even with a fine costar as Mila Kunas, this movies misses the mark on many levels. The premise is weak, with Robin (who has alienated all the people around him) given 45 minutes to live. In this time he wants to make amends with all those people he has alienated. In the meantime, Mila Kunis, runs around Brooklyn trying to find him, and tell him she was wrong in her diagnosis. He goes from location to location to find the people, and she goes from location to location, just missing him each time. They do finally ""meet"" under strange circumstances, and the movie winds to a close with a few brief scenes, including his bonding with his alienated son. There are some laughs, and a few brief moments of acting, but I just could not give it more than two stars. I may have just had a bad day, so watch it, and see for yourself.

In the angriest man there were clues early on, but clues can be deceptive. Being a senior citizen, I came to understand that I believe it was not so much anger as it was frustration. That I can relate to easily. You work, good performance marks, but still there's no satisfaction. Around the house, it doesn't take much to ruin a good day. The freezer quits running and all the ice cream is melting; the repairman can't come for two weeks, so you start calling . . . Your spouse just can't be bothered. What?  You have a brain aneurysm! Because the good doctor is also frustrated, she throws out a 90 minute pending death. Thanks to the good doctor who started out with her own frustration, yet is now out to make amends and finally breaks through to help the angry man with some solutions. (Taking care of the cab driver) I think the reunion with the son was the scene that broke down the wall between the anger and the love. Excellent movie!",1443139200,3,1099,4.387254901960785

6384144,4,B00JPFTPDY,"Please, no more comments about a character's/persona's death and his ""real life.""  As a pianist, I've played quite a few shows for comics (though I'd rather do vocalists and magicians).  A stand-up comedian's job has become tougher than ever in the age of superhero movies with special effects and a jump cut every two seconds.  Wit, jokes and charisma aren't enough to prevent the ""death"" that comics fear (and all too often experience) each time they take the stage.  Added to the comedian's gift of improvisation is the necessity of going to the subjects that ""touch a nerve""--sex (premarital and marital), toilet business, race, drugs and death chief among them.  With the good comics we laugh through the pain, realizing we're getting a glimpse of the reality that the ""superhero"" movies and video games (e.g. ""Minecraft"") enable us to escape from.

Robin Williams is a brilliant talent.  His last appearance on Johnny Carson's last Tonight Show was, in itself, a masterful performance--as was his first feature film, ""Pop-Eye.""  But along the way he's had to waste his talent on scripts with some of the worst, corniest, most humiliating commercial slop served up by Hollywood.  ""Angriest Man"" gives us a chance to esperience Williams' brilliance, much of which is necessarily laced with profanity, which can be a powerful tool in the comedian's playbook if used selectively.  ""Angry Man"" fails when it resorts to the ""F-- "" word for no better reason that to alleviate, or clear the atmosphere, of the excessive, cloying sentiment that it obviously sees as essential to a box office success.

The film would be a five-star movie if it ended about ten minutes earlier.  Williams' character asks: ""Would you really want to know when you're going to die.""  For him, the answer is yes--because then he can atone for a life of loss and regrets, making the most of each precious remaining instant.  Having made this point, he demonstrates his newfound happiness and peace by laying his head upon his sympathetic nurse's shoulder and closing his eyes.  The shot fades to black.

At that moment, we're not sure whether Williams' character has died before our eyes or is taking a nap.  It doesn't matter.  It's a blessed sleep, however long or short.  But sadly, the film's most powerful moment is wasted, all but thrown away, by a narrated epilogue that's the sappiest piece of filmmaking I've seen since ""Patch Adams.""  If the filmmakera had an ounce of the courage that all great comics must possess, they would have ended the film at that poignant, provocative moment (and perhaps deleted several gratuitous ""F-"" words).

About Williams' career, it might be said that he has never failed his material. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the producers of the maudlin, lifeless, inferior emphera Williams was so often saddled with--films like ""Patch Adams,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" and ""A Night at the Museum.""  If I resent them, it's because they prevent us from experiencing the comic genius of this singular artist.  (Would you make Charlie Parker play in a pit orchestra?  Would you put John Coltrane in a circus band?) Would you make Clifford Brown exchange his trumpet for a toy ""Jew's harp"" in an Adam Sandler movie?

Perhaps Robin sensed that his greatest opportunities as a creative comic were behind him.  Above all, he had managed not only to visit but to entertain his old but immobilized friend, Christopher Reeves.  No doubt it was a performance that no one (including Robin himself) could ever hope to top.",1440115200,2,3522,4.955706984667803

A man is told by his doctor that he has 90 minutes to live, and he does everything he can to see and make things right with his family and friends. He has some missteps and certainly doesn't become a nice person in every instance, but his true character shows through. What's great is that we see the depth of the main character - he was a wonderful person until a family tragedy broke him down.

I highly recommend this movie, but if you have any family-related issues, or even if you don't, be ready to cry if you're prone to crying. I was in tears thinking about what a happy childhood the characters had, and in happy tears at the ending of the movie, which was positive despite all the negativity within,

One thing that I loved was that Peter Dinklage was given a role to truly show his acting skills that didn't center around his size - he was given a role in which it didn't matter, letting his acting stand for itself.",1436572800,,1106,4.3076923076923075

6384663,5,B00JPFTPDY,"Some movies really test your suspension of disbelief and The Angriest Man In Brooklyn does it in a huge way. The timing is all wonky (I know what a ""New York minute"" is and it still doesn't explain how so much elapses in a supposed 90), children dying before their parents can be seen as a somewhat contrived plot device, some of the dialogue is choppy though not completely off, and I really wanted to slap the crap out of Louis CK just for existing in it at all (though he did make his character even more hateable than it would read on paper, so, yay?). But through it all, I felt myriad emotions and a connection to pretty much all of the characters. Even the aforementioned scallywag who needs a good punching.

Why on Earth it was so ill received I don't know. All you movie goers are clamoring for movies like Frozen and this couldn't even get a fair shake? Something tells me that the average American, who usually does just fine in the pretend land of celluloid, doesn't want to be majorly bummed by a protagonist who, like the person playing him, had a dark sense of humor, and whose personal trauma painted the work he was associated with. I wish I could have been one of the few to write a positive review for this film when it was still more relevant and newly released, instead I watched it posthumously because it was on my damn watchlist. That's a crying shame. If you have the gonads I recommend it, if not, please stick to kid's movies.",1435276800,,1454,4.385185185185185

6384772,5,B00JPFTPDY,"I realize that most critics have given this movie about 3-1/2 stars, but this is a movie made by Robin Williams during the last year of his life, and because of plot developments that are ironic in light of his suicide and because James Earl Jones was a stutterer as a child, and even because David Dinklage was treated as a full character not just a quirky subordinate character who happened to be a dwarf, I was fascinated by the movie and the personal facts surrounding it.  The plot (loosely) is as follows:

Robin Williams character is told by his temporary doctor (very well played by Mila Kunis) that he has 90 minutes to live.  Therefore, Williams' character tries to run around and say and do all the things he can possibly do to make things right before he passes, and Kunis' character tries to catch up with him to tell him has more than 90 minutes to live.  Hamish Linklater, a brilliant actor and playwright who plays Christine's brother, Michael, on THE NEW ADVENTURES OF OLD CHRISTINE is also compelling in this movie.  The actor (I should know his name but can't think of it)  who plays a former high school classmate of Williams' character (he played Paul on MAD ABOUT YOU is also brilliant.  The writing is crisp and imaginative.  It is a sad, compelling and (believe it or not) very funny story.",1434067200,,1314,4.561702127659575

6384947,2,B00JPFTPDY,"I have to admit I'm not a huge Robin Williams fan; however, I do like some of his movies. The acting isn't great. He plays a typical role. There's just a bunch of profanity and temper tantrums. That was my take away. I agree with other reviews that the message is good I still can only give it 2 stars.",1432684800,,302,4.05
6384948,4,B00JPFTPDY,"This is a very hard movie to grade. This is primarily because Robin Williams was very ill when he made it. He already had Parkinson's, Lewy Bodies on his Brain, depression, and a host of other diseases which may or may not have been dormant then, such as alcohol and drug abuse plus hallucinations from the Lewy Bodies and heart problems. So the movie in an odd way fits him as it is about a man with a very serious medical condition which could kill him at any minute. However, his problem in the movie can be helped by surgery whereas his real life problems did not have any solution. He is a very nasty guy in the opening of this film through a great deal of the rest of it. This has all come about because he lost his eldest son two years ago in an accident. He is a walking, talking body of anger as a result. And, who knows, maybe he was angry given all the real life bad news he had been given. I can definitely tell he was unwell when he made this. He is not quite struggling but he is reaching and he never had to reach before. You can see the same phenomenon in his tv show ""The Crazy Ones"". On a historical note this makes this last work noteworthy because it shows a genius of a performer, to whom his art came fairly effortlessly, reach out to grasp the last of it in a few final efforts. These efforts are not his best but they are his last as he goes out like the trouper he was. I don't know if it is possible to ""enjoy"" this movie knowing all of this in hindsight but you are seeing a lot in it which was never really intended to be seen. Value it for what it is.",1432598400,,1580,4.035031847133758

I like seeing movies made on my own turf, and this took place entirely in Brooklyn, with the aid of City Hall. I get a thrill seeing Robin Williams at all the familiar landmarks. There is also some significance as Robin Williams did die shortly afterwards. It is also based on an Israeli movie by Assi Dayan who died recently as well. So I find my reaction different from that of a disinterested critic - whether or not the movie is really that well made,  It definitely does not seem to have high Hollywood standards, seems more like a low-budget indie effort, and as if the famous actors donated their time to the project.  I just don't see that this should disqualify it.",1431993600,,758,4.478260869565218

It falls into a category that isn't easily defined, that is, I would not call it a drama, nor a comedy.

The only real Jew in the film are Mila Kunis and Melissa Leo, the former playing a mid-western (?) doctor and the later as bitter wife, and quite well too.  The film lights up when she comes on.  The film then, at least for me, had false notes all over it. Too much weight and not enough buoyancy.  TAMIB felt awfully contrived, something thought up at an Internet cafe in LA between lattes:  Hey, what is  man really did jump off the Brooklyn Bridge?

We were unaware of this Robin Williams film -- we came across it when browsing for something to watch and being fans of the actor decided to choose the film to watch. The main character, played by Robin, is easily relate-able to anyone who has felt as though his or her life has been dealt one bad blow after another, ultimately creating an angry persona. Robin Williams brilliantly plays the character well... and the bittersweet irony is that his own life ended the same year he made the movie (I won't go into too much detail or it might give the plot away).",1428019200,,573,4.466666666666667

One day he goes to the doctor and finds out he has a brain aneurism and only a short time to live. During this time he tries to figure out what to do before his time is up, but everyone he tries to reach out to hates him, including his wife who was having an affair with multiple partners. His only son alive is avoiding him and don't take his dad seriously that is until everyone learns that his time is short. Then everyone tries to find him before its too late.

If you would like to tear up during an emotional movie about how a life can change in an instant then watch this movie. There is some black humor in it and you will get a few wry chuckles especially if you have had this type of loss in your family.

It is as if someone wrote a script asking ""What would you do if you only had 90 minutes to live?"" Then they read the script and decided it wasn't funny. So, someone else said ""Make Robin Williams the star, he's a funny guy.""  Robin has a long legacy of funny movies, but this is not one of them. It is sad. Perhaps the irony is that this is his last fully completed move (2014) about a man thinking he was going to die. The directed wasted a great cast on a not so funny comedy.",1427155200,,574,4.125

6386389,4,B00JPFTPDY,"Judging from previous reviews, not everyone liked this movie. ""Depressing"", ""disappointing"", ""a waste of talent"" were some of the words used to describe this movie. Be that as it may, I saw the movie in a different light. As always Robin Williams was superb. Supporting actors also excellent. I did not find the movie to be depressing, but rather compelling. Robin Williams was a talented and versatile actor. I'm not familiar with this director's work, but I enjoyed the story. I found this to be the type of movie that leaves you thinking about your own life. After all, isn't that what makes a good movie ""great""? I especially found it profound to think of how Williams character tries to take his own life toward the end of the movie. It left me wondering about Williams in real life. The sad and unfortunate truth that in the end of his own life that is precisely what he did. The emotional pain he must have been in. I'm happy to say that I was able to see Williams in a different light throughout his career. What a brilliant man. So much talent. I'm glad that he left us with all those memories-from Mork and Mindy to Good Morning Vietnam, to Mrs. Countries, and on and on. Overall, I found this to be a very good movie.",1426636800,,1228,4.4622222222222225

6386391,3,B00JPFTPDY,"Robin Williams stars as Henry Altmann, a man that is told he has 90 minutes to live. I like how the movie addresses our horrible health care system in which doctors are overworked, over booked and overstressed so that they often resent their professions. We finally see a caring doctor, Mila Kunis as Doctor Sharon Gill, who has to tell (her lover the elusive Dr Fielding's patient) Henry, that he has a brain aneurysm. After Dr Gill tells him he has 90 minutes to live, Henry heads over to meet with his brother Aaron (wonderfully portrayed by Peter Dinklage) at their office, and asks clients: 'What should this client do if he has 90 minutes to live?' The answers are not surprising, but Robin picks the best choice: to spend time with his family. After that, it's a race against time for poor Henry as he tries to make peace with his family. Henry never resolves things with his wife Bette (poignantly played by Melissa Leo) but the audience surely is thrilled as Henry finally reconnects with his estranged son and they enjoy Henry's final days playing cards. There are objectionable scenes in this movie they call a comedy? It is not suitable for children. It is not for the weak at heart as Henry takes a dive in the river. And there are a lot of raw sad and funny scenes --especially as the end goes up in ashes-that makes for a sad poignant movie.",1426636800,,1356,4.516260162601626

Language was horrendous.
They could have done it without all the foul language.
The scene with the Doctor in the hospital was obscene and did nothing for the film.
That's sadly, what the film industry has come to.
On the plus side however.
I laughed so hard until it hurt in the scene where he is buying the video camera.
Classic Williams there.
Seeing him play this role and what actually happens in real life is really what makes this film a must see.

If you're looking for a movie about what you would do if you were placed in a life or death situation and how that would effect your human relations, and you are interested in how your life might effect other people, then this might be the movie for you.

In light of Robin Williams' tragic end, there is something poignant and telling about it. If Robin Williams had still been with us when I first saw this film, I think I would have smiled and thought that you know, Robin Williams does have quite a range as an actor. And he did. Watching THE ANGRIEST MAN IN BROOKLYN, I just can't help wondering what was going on in Robin Williams' personal life when he made this film. A doctor tells him that he has 90 minutes to live. What will he do with those 90 minutes? What will go through his life during those 90 minutes? Essentially, that is the film in a nutshell, but Robin William being Robin Williams it at times gets frenetic. But the frenzy seems to be controlled and unsure and that makes me think of Robin Williams, the man, not the actor. This film deserves several viewings and I will come back to it from time to time.

Alas, it's a very bad movie, it probably is Robin's worst.  Too bad he ended his brilliant career with this boring, infuriating, and pointless C.R.A.P.  Ok, being fair, the movie is not completely lame. The general idea of not wasting your time on earth (especially your last few hours), doing what you love, and valuing your family is the one reason why I gave it two stars.  However, the way the director proposes to strenghten his plot is ludicrous. Not funny, rather preposterous.

6386559,3,B00JPFTPDY,"Yes, I am saying The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is just OK because it is a little dull and the plot is unlikely. However, if you are looking for life imitating art, then you have found the right movie. Robin Williams plays an attorney named Henry Altmann. He is diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and Dr. Gill, played by Mila Kunis, announces the diagnosis to Altmann. Since Altmann is a very angry, bitter, impatient, and harsh man (hmmm...that must be where they got the title), he pressures her to tell him how much time he has left. Dr. Gill is so frustrated by Altmann's attitude that she tells him 90 minutes. So now Altmann goes in search of his family and friends to tell them one last goodbye. Things do not go as planned. *****SPOILER MATERIAL AHEAD*****

Now is when some of the paralells between Williams' and Altmann's lives begin.
1) Both think they have nothing left to live for and want to committ suicide. Altmann's dive off the bridge fails because Dr. Gill rescues him. Robin could have felt he had nothing left to live for and sadly, his suicide attempt was successful.
2) Robin lived from 1951-2014. So did his character Henry Altmann. In the movie, we learn that Henry lives eight more days.
3) Robin's ashes were scattered near the San Francisco Bay. Henry's ashes were scattered just off the coast of Brooklyn so both the actor and the character were laid to rest in the water.
4) Henry asks Dr. Gill if she would want to know when she is going to die. She says no. Henry knows he is dying soon and he is OK with that because then he can make his peace with everyone. Robin chose when, where, and how he died. So both Henry and Robin wanted some control over their deaths.
The last several minutes of the movie are just hearbreaking knowing what we do now.",1412553600,,1775,4.461538461538462

This movie was so horrific I couldn't make my way throught it, mostly because I didn't want to taint my opinion of Robin Williams at the time (before his death), I can only tell you that the language at the beginning and the atrocious way he treats people at the beginning of the movie was soul numbing to watch.",1412553600,,722,4.348148148148148

6386578,4,B00JPFTPDY,"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is a drama/comedy that will have you near tears in particular scenes and laughing out loud in others. In this film William plays the role of Henry Altmann, a grumpy man who takes his anger out on the rest of the worldand everyone in it. Henrys mood declines throughout the introduction from a series of events; getting stuck in traffic, getting into a car accident, sitting cramped between a shirtless man and another large man in the waiting room, waiting on the doctor for two hours, and being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. After receiving this shocking news from his temporary doctor, an intern played by Mila Kunis, Henry asks how severe his diagnosis is. Altmann quickly becomes upset and pressures his young intern into telling him an expected time of death, which is she replies with ninety minutes.

In the introduction of the film, Henry loses his patience while waiting for a stoplight. Upon waiting he added subwoofers to his mental list of things he hates. A few examples are dog crap, car alarms, ass-crack fashion, mens cologne, and the Knicks. The narration, done by Williams in this particular scene, accomplishes establishing Altmanns attitude as he rattles off his list of many examples. You can hear the hatred towards every single item on the list. The camera shots play a big role in this scene. For every item on the list not only does the camera shot change, but so do the angry expressions Williams provides his audience. At the conclusion of the list, Henry tears through the intersection that finally turns green only to be struck by a taxi driver who has ran a red light. This scene sets the tone for this film perfectly.

I have to admit that after reading the back of this movie cover I expected the plot to be a major clich. 1) Angry man gets diagnosed with a terminal illness. 2) Mans perspective changes from the bad news. 3) Man realizes the scars hes left behind so he attempts to make things right. 4) Man dies in peace. Of course parts of the plot fit somewhat within these parameters, but strategic comic relief throughout the film makes this a must see
.
A perfect example of this is the scene in the camera shop while Altmann patiently waits as his life grows shorter and a worker with a speech impediment tries to sell him a camera. I love that the script has Altmann ask multiple questions. This really drags the scene out, ultimately creating a great comic effect. I also want to note that I do not think this is a funny scene due to the mans disability, and I can see how this scene may seem offensive to some viewers.

Narration also played a large role throughout the film. Narration introduced two important characters, as they progressed through their struggling day. The dialog in Henrys narration towards the end of the film also plays a vital part. The dialogue helps create the role of the dying Henry Altmann. Many of the final scenes of narration are quite chilling, especially after the recent death of Robin Williams.

Although I have never watched the original version The 92 Minutes of Mr. Baum, written and directed by Assi Dayan in 1997 and the modern version hasn't had the best reviews, I feel this movie is worth watching. Robin Williams and Mila Kunis were a great combination together. This film was relatively short at one hour and twenty-three minutes long making it an easy watch with a few laughs and tears along the way.",1411603200,4,3421,4.658940397350993
6386579,3,B00JPFTPDY,"Any Robin Williams movie seems precious now.  I enjoyed this -- not a life-changing film, but one that is well acted and the characters seem to grow on you.  Mila Kunis holds her own very well in this film as well.",1411430400,,214,4.195121951219512
6386580,4,B00JPFTPDY,very sad to watch this right after he died.,1411171200,,43,3.888888888888889
6386581,3,B00JPFTPDY,"THE FILM: Yes, I'm aware that Robin Williams has a few more movies in the can that have yet to be released, but this was the last one released theatrically before he passed away, and serves as sort of an epitaph to his life and career. It's not particularly inventive or great for that matter, but there are parts to his character in this movie that can be seen as drawing from his real-life experiences. While this is the job of an actor, to get inside the head of a character, the way they often do this is by drawing on their own life experiences. It's probably not an accident that Robin Williams ended up playing a lot divorced men in his career, seeing as how he was divorced twice during his lifetime. Anyway, back to the movie. The story is rather simple: Henry Altmann (Williams) is told by his doctor (Mila Kunis) that he has a brain aneurysm, and has 90 minutes to live. He then sets out to reconnect with the important people in his life. At around 84 minutes, you might think that the film is insufficiently long, and you'd be partially right. Character development is kept to a minimum, and done mostly in flashback, but the brevity of the film actually kind of works with the urgency of the Henry's situation. All of the parts are well-played, but Mila Kunis is the least of them. Robin Williams played angry rather well, but Mila Kunis came off as screechy and annoying a lot of the time. Melissa Leo also did a good job as Henry's estranged wife. Story-wise, there isn't a whole lot going on. It goes at a workman-like pace, but you could feel the mechanics of the storytelling in a way that cheapened whatever emotional payoff they were going for. There were only two moments that moved me: the first is Henry recording a video message for his son, and the other is him in a hospital bed, with voiceover narration that was uncomfortably close to reality. Speaking of voiceover, there is a bit too much of it, and it comes from both Robin Williams' and Mila Kunis' characters. Thematically, there isn't any new ground broken either. There have been many films which try to show the importance of family and making peace with others. Still, it is an admirable message and it didn't feel belabored or trite here. Overall, this was a quirky little indie film that has decent performances and a good message. Not one of Robin Williams' best, but it is a fitting end to a long career.

THE DISC: The film was made within the last year, and the audiovisual quality is obviously top-notch. What disappoints me a little bit is the lack of extra material. All you get is a 6-minute promotional featurette and a gag reel.

OVERALL: While it probably won't be listed as one of Robin Williams' greatest, it is a film worth watching, if only in his memory. He was a comic genius who brought laughter to so many people and he will be missed greatly. For most people, this won't be essential viewing, but a Robin Williams completist will want to add this to their collection.",1411084800,2,2977,4.511111111111111
6386582,4,B00JPFTPDY,"I first looked at ordering this movie before Robin Williams passed away, back then it had an average rating of less than two stars.  Looking at those earlier reviews now after having watched the film it seems the low rating was due to the misconception that because Robin Williams was in this (and perhaps Mila Kunis as well) that it was a comedy.  Of course the Angriest Man in Brooklyn isn't a comedy, it has a few funny moments to lighten the mood and push the plot along, but the film is actually a reflection on life, what did we learn today, what would I do in this situation (told you have 90 minutes to live) as well as the situations leading up to this, such as treat everyone else after the loss of a child.  Robin Williams plays an angry at the world, grumpy old man, he's not supposed to be funny on screen in this one.  He's not supposed to be likeable for most of the film either, until you realise and emphasise with him near the end on how he got to be like he is (not that you'll still think Henry blameless for his choices).  This is a role that Robin William played very well.  He evoked the feelings from the audience towards his character that we were supposed to feel about Henry. We weren't supposed to be watching waiting for Henry to make witty comments.

Now I'm not saying this is the best film ever written, it's not, but it's certainly higher than two stars if you go into it with the idea you can let Robin Williams play a part that isn't a comedic role.  There are holes in the plot but overall its still a worthwhile film.  Kunis (who is also listed as a producer in the opening credits) does a good job once her role takes her out of the hospital. I didn't quite buy her as a physician though, nor find the confrontational scene with Henry that instigates the whole plot where Henry believes he only have 90 minutes to live to believable. I also didn't buy that she would be having an affair with an old bearded overweight doctor who's almost as unlikeable demeanour wise as Henry.

I did like how Peter Dinklage plays a role where no one mentions or puts down his character for being short.  He's just a regular character (Henry's brother) and I found this refreshing.  James Earl Jones plays a shop store assistant (perhaps owner) with a severe stutter.  It was a little predictable where that was going with the fffff ffff fffff setup.  I found it a bit unrealistic that Henry believing his life is ticking away would not just interrupt him and tell him ""Look I'm about to die, I don't even need to own the camera just film me saying goodbye to my son, and charge me whatever you want for the tape, just write play this for my son on the outside"" or something like that.  There are a number of times in Henry's 90 minutes where I found it a bit of a stretch that he wouldn't interrupt people wasting his time more often, such as in his brother's office, at the restaurant etc.

Overall the film does come across as being a bit rushed script wise.  There are moments where you think, as if that would happen or as if a character would behave like that, such as with the police officer for example. There's also a scene were a character says they are going home but they don't and are still there later.  I'd rate this as a three and a half star film due to those sorts of script aspects. But it's still an enjoyable movie and one of the last films we'll get to see William's acting talent.  Especially as the rare for him non comedic role character.  Definitely worth watching, at least once.",1411084800,8,3527,4.331306990881459

I know, I have a pic with him in Iraq; sad I didn't know until then. Shame on me.

~~I ""think"", not 100% sure, that my favorite comedy movie of RW is Mrs. Doubtfire. I laughed so hard, my ribs hurt the first time I saw it, a gazillion years ago. In recent years, he has acted in some pretty awesome ""life"" (not necessarily comedy) movies as well.
~~~~~My own personal review of Robin Williams in his last few movies, and perhaps (partially in life??)... He was obviously depressed and hurting. I think a huge factor in that depression was that he no longer felt he had the love of his fans/followers, and once again, I am ashamed of myself as he brought so much joy to my life.

~I write my comments/thoughts/review based on the actor, AND the context of the two movies below(MPOV), and as a life long fan. Please remember I said MPOV.

I bought both of these movies (below) recently, and wanted to share my thoughts, as I had not seen either. If you are a Robin Williams fan, add them to your collection. PS.. these are amazon links, I do not get a penny.

WORLD'S GREATEST DAD~~~ This is NOT a comedy!

A movie about life/tragedy with a bit of comedy mixed in.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PI1NQU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 .. I know there is a way to add the link, I'm just not ""learned"" yet.. copy n paste (ctrl c, ctrl v works well for me).... hum oh well, I tried..

It was one of his FEW ""darker side"" movies, and I felt he did a pretty decent job trying to mix in a bit of humor (which we love him for most), with the context of the movie.
~ His son died from autoerotic asphyxiation. Dad (RW) was ashamed, and made it look as if the son was just depressed, and committed suicide. Meanwhile, Dad took advantage of the situation, to become the writer he had always wanted to be.
~~Pretty decent movie all in all. Glad I added it to my collection.

ANGRIEST MAN IN BROOKLYN~~ Comedy/life

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JPFTPDY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1Angriest Man in Brooklyn [Blu-ray].. Sorry, I've never have done much with the links.

Yes, another of his ""slightly"" different movies, but still a comedy, dealing with life (love, death, family). I enjoyed it, appreciated it, AND MORE IMPORTANT, I GOT IT!~~~I could feel what he was saying, and I bet many others will too, if they watch it! I know many of those feelings well.
~What would you do if you were told you were going to die in 90 minutes??? That is the beginning..

This one has much more comedy/better acting (for me) in it, than the above. However, these are two totally different ""life movies""..

Williams character was real. There ARE people out there just like that.  Angry.  I enjoyed his performance and the rest of the cast too all had their moments.
And people need to get over the word f*ck.  I personally find the word at times the most appropriate word to use in the English language.  It carries weight and no other word can suffice at times.  It is one of my favorite words.  And I consider myself an intelligent person with a relatively wide range of vocabulary.  Why people find it offensive I am not sure.  Perhaps some have religious reasons and think it's a ""sin"".
F*ck  is a word that has been around for centuries.  It isn't going anywhere and it is the way people speak.  People from all walks of life say the word f*ck.
some people need to get over it.
Anyway back to the premise of the film.
What would you do if you knew you had 92 minutes  to live?
  It certainly gives us food for thought.

Dinklage does well and movie presents nice crisp images of Downtown Brooklyn & brownstones.  The story however, is a train wreck.  Early morning sun on the Brooklyn Bridge one minute, and a few minutes later it's coming from the southwest.  Nice sunny day, but under an hour or so later it's not just darkest night, but heavy rains (makes more dramatic interior car scene is my guess).  NYPD, or any law enforcement officers and physicians will cringe by the manner in which they are portrayed in this film.

Yes, you have to suspend disbelief a little that he would believe what the doctor said but that is minor. I thought Robin Williams was brilliant and VERY three dimensional and deep in this role. He developed the character so well. Mila Kunis did a great job as well. She brought depth to her character. I actually could feel what the characters were feeling. The desperation in Williams's character was palatable. I could feel what he was feeling in many scenes. The one where he meets up with his friend from childhood was well done.

6386690,4,B00JPFTPDY,"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is sad. It's not an easy movie on the emotions, especially after Robin Williams' death. Mila Kunis, to me, showed a whole new side. In this movie, she's a pill popping resident who can't take Robin Williams' attitude and tells him he has 90 minutes before a brain aneurysm kills him. Once he leaves, she's immediately remorseful and heads out into New York City to find him and get him back into the hospital.

There is lots of swearing. If you can't take bad language, don't watch the movie. There were times I wondered how much of this felt autobiographical to Robin Williams, but only he knows. His performance is definitely emotional, especially as he sets off to find his adult son. Peter Dinklage and Melissa Leo have smaller parts as his brother and wife, respectively.

This isn't a comedy, which I think many people were expecting of Williams. It's a drama and one that definitely had me in tears and choked up. Especially at the end, but I won't go into that because it would be a spoiler.

6386694,4,B00JPFTPDY,"I had been thinking about watching this even before Robin's untimely death--the previews looked good and I love Robin, and Peter Dinklage. Wasn't sure it was my kind of movie but I'm always willing to give Robin the benefit of the doubt because you know, it's Robin Williams. Having watched it after his passing, I'm not sure how objective my review can be, but all I can do is be honest. That being said, I really liked it. It wasn't over the top funny in a Mrs. Doubtfire kind of way, but it wasn't a total drama either. There are some really good laughs in the movie, and there are also some dramatic moments, and a few that tug at your heartstrings too. All in all, I think Robin's performance was wonderful, as were those of his co-stars. Was it my favorite movie of the year? No. But it was absolutely worth watching. If you're expecting wild and zany Robin, I think you'll be slightly disappointed. But if you're expecting a good story, really good performances, and some laughs here and there along the way, then I think you'll like it as much as I did.

Robin was a gift to the world and his talent was a part of my childhood--I grew up on Mork and Mindy, and I loved so many of his movies into my adulthood. It is so sad that this man had to leave us so soon. But thankfully, we have the magic that was Robin Williams captured on film, so that we may continue to enjoy it for years to come.

Henry is an angry, bitter middle-aged man who's just been given a grim medical diagnosis by Dr. Sharon Gill (Mila Kunis).  Shocked, Henry berates a burned-out and disenchanted Dr. Gill, insisting she tell him exactly how much longer he as to live. In frustration and glancing around her office, she blurts out ""90 minutes!"" which is actually how long the cover of a magazine tells her it takes to baste a turkey breast.  Dismayed, Henry storms out and must decide how to spend what he thinks are the last 90 minutes of his life.  Meanwhile, Dr. Gill realizes her malpractice and pursues Henry, always one step behind, in an attempt to rectify her negligence and maybe even her life.  Anyone who's contemplated their own life, death and regrets will relate to the movie's insightful and touching moments.  The story is a compelling one, and Robin Williams does a lot with a less than perfect script.  The movie contains some off-color language that is emotionally appropriate in several scenes, but in others seems gratuitous.

Always unhappy, angry at the world and everyone in it, Henry sits impatiently in his doctors office until he is finally seen by Dr. Sharon Gill (Mila Kunis). Sharon, whos going through her own tough day, reveals that Henry has a brain aneurysm.

This news pushes Henry over the edge and he yells at Sharon, demanding to know how much time he has left. Retaliating against Henrys insults, she abruptly tells him he has only 90 minutes. Shocked, Henry storms out of the office. Sharon is stunned by her own lapse of professional behavior and goes on a city-wide search to find Henry. He, meanwhile, struggles with his diagnosis and determines to make amends with everyone he has hurt.

The supporting cast is strong  Peter Dinklage, Melissa Leo, James Earl Jones, Hamish Linklater, Richard Kind, Bob Dishy, and Sutton Foster  but, despite some cool Brooklyn locations, the film never catches fire, despite Mr. Williams histrionics.

Williams' character is not at all the likable, lovable, unpredictable, FUNNY guy that he was in SO MANY other films--and in real life.  I cannot help but wonder if this movie is a reflection of what was going on his mind.  Weirdly appropriate.

Writing this after the death of Williams, a comedic god among men, I can't help feeling like perhaps this movie's message somehow resonated with Williams.  It's a good one:  You don't live forever.  Make your relationships right.

I am not going to remember Robin Williams for this movie, but I will ALWAYS remember him for the HITS he made when he was happier, healthier, and a light among mankind.  From Mrs. Doubtfire to Good Morning Vietnam to Jumanji to Birdcage to Hook to Good Will Hunting to Alladin--the list goes on and on.  He made children and adults laugh and cry and FEEL life more than they did before watching his films, comedy specials, and interviews.

6386772,3,B00JPFTPDY,"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, directed by Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams), delves into what happens when one is given a terminal diagnosis and how time left might be spent.

Henry Altmann (Williams), after a short intro family flashback, is shown having a rotten day stuck in New York traffic. He gets into a crash with a taxi, unleashes vitriol on the immigrant cab driver, spewing racial epithets. Henry has a big chip and is looking to make someone else's day more miserable than his own.

After a 2 hour wait at a medical appointment, Dr. Sharon Gill (Mila Kunis), one of the films best performances, tells Henry he has a brain aneurysm. Henry berates the doctor into telling him how much time he has left. She snaps out a reply of 90 minutes. Henry explodes in anger, and butt hanging out of his hospital gown, runs out into the city street.

Henry struggles with this diagnosis. He wants to have sex with his wife, meet his business partner and brother, have a party with old friends, and, most importantly, find his son, Tommy (Hamish Linklater). Aside from the premise of the impractically of trying to get anywhere in New York City in 90 minutes in rush hour, the film is an exercise in heavy-handed direction. The action becomes a scramble as Henry rushes to live out his 90 minutes which includes suicide by jumping off the Brooklyn bridge (saved from drowning by Kunis) who is chasing after him with information on his condition).  He emerges from the river with only a limp, snags a cab with the doctor, where the driver is the one Henry insulted earlier.

This is 83 minutes of full-throttle Williams. It is at times annoying, as in the scene where he buys a video recorder to leave a note to his son. He explodes enraged at a badly stuttering store clerk played by James Earl Jones. The stuttering, funny for about four seconds, highlights the problem with the film as director Robinson and writer Dan Taplitz push the viewer into suspending belief beyond believability.

An an uneven film that strains to be credible. It does not stand up well as a dark comedy closing with an ending that is pure schmaltz. Williams is a great actor but this vehicle is a hardly roadworthy clunker that does not justify his talent.",1407196800,4,2236,4.633838383838384

It's a poor ""attempt"" at dark comedy with the structure of a family-coming-together drama, and is scripted and delivered like a bad Sitcom.  If you like any of the four people featured on the cover then in this you will find the lowest point for each of them.  Robin Williams is told that he will die... and he's so unlikeable that you don't care if he does.  Mila Kunis does the telling because she's having a bad day.  That could cause her to lose her job... and you don't care if she does.  William's wife is cheating on him... and you don't care if she stops.  William's has one dead son and is alienating his other, who's a professional ballroom dancer.  Peter Dinklage is a Jewish lawyer, brother to Williams and the only functional one.  The actors showed up and shot this in a week.  I'll bet money.  I'll bet the amount this movie makes in returns.

He goes through the grief stages of anger, confusion and desperation before reaching the stage where he can love again.

Henry leaves angry but quickly changes and tries to make everything right with his family before time runs out. Before I started this I was expecting something along the lines of Falling Down. While it was a little similar this one was different. Robin Williams did a good job in this but it isn't one of his better performances. He did however pull off the hard aspect of making a character that isn't nice to anyone but still had enough heart that you root for him.

This forces Henry to run around Brooklyn attempting to connect and make amends for the past. Meanwhile Sharon is attempting to locate him as she sees he own career going down the tubes as well.

The film opens with both Henry and Sharon talking about themselves in third person narration and then again at the end. The production attempts to combine quirky humor with a heart warming tale, but falls short. Robin Williams, who was supposed to play an angry unlikeable character, unfortunately comes across as an angry unlikeable character, who has no one to blame but himself. Both Henry and Sharon are forced to examine their lives, hence the heart warming part as the sound track attempts to make us feel good about them.

Should do as a rental after the Magnolia films options.

The problem, IMHO, with this movie is it never decided if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama - as a result it tries to incorporate both genres, but does so poorly.  Robin Williams was not as good as he usually is, and the parts played by Kunis and Dinklage (both great actors) did not play to their strengths.  As such you get the feeling that pretty much any half way decent no name actor could have stepped into those roles and done an as good if not better job.  I would curious to see if this is one of those movies that was killed by poor post-production/editing where the final film does not match what the writers/actors were working towards during shooting.

Sure, we tend to get caught up in the everyday BS that seems to engulf our lives, but when it comes down to it, what's most important? Imagine knowing that you only have 90 minutes (or hours, or days) to live, what would you do? Focus on the BS and waste what's left of it?

8652808,1,B00JPFTPDY,"Toward the end of his life, his star having significantly dimmed, Robin Williams made a lot of curious independent features that served to pay the bills and keep him in the public eye.

Some, such as the almost impossibly dark black comedy ""World's Greatest Dad,"" were bold, if nonetheless desperate choices. Others, like ""The Big White"" and the film adaptation of Armistead Maupin's novel ""The Night Listener,"" were minor, meandering curiosities.

But there's nothing even remotely positive to say about ""The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,"" which provided Williams his final starring film role.

Its Debby-Downer of a plot centers on a once happy-go-lucky man descended into seething rage and self-loathing after one of his two sons dies tragically.

Diagnosed with an inoperable brain aneurysm and lied to by a frustrated doctor that he has only 90 minutes to live, he decides to make every minute count by repairing his estranged relationships with his wife and remaining son.

You will like or sympathize with no one in this film, especially Williams, who tragically appears to be struggling just to get through it, and most especially overrated actress Mila Kunis as the terrible, terrible doctor who gives the Williams character his fake diagnosis out of sheer selfishness and conceit, and whose quest to find him and make it right is rooted in those two characteristics alone. The film wants you to root for her. You will root for the revoking of her license to practice medicine, and perhaps jail time.

This all builds to a schmaltzy climax on the Brooklyn Bridge, for no good reason, and the awfully unconvincing green-screen composite shot has to be seen to be believed.

The great Peter Dinklage, as the Williams character's brother, is brilliant as usual, but utterly wasted. Seriously, you'll wish for a sequel or TV series featuring his devout Jewish little person lawyer.

He's the only good thing about this movie, which is otherwise about as entertaining as reading the obituary of an old high school chum.",1508630400,,2019,5.042042042042042

8652812,1,B00JPFTPDY,"What a piece of crap. Robin Williams was a bit annoying when he was trying to be funny, but this is extremely annoying. The angry little bag of meat that he portrays in this film has no humor nor other value that I can see. Well on the bright side at least we won't be subjected to this specific kind of crap anymore.
