8551202,4,B00AG3U2ZY,"In MY QUEEN, the central conflict is less on the ""Queen"" of the title and more on the ""King"" who views her as such. The Queen is Shan Wu Shuang (Cheryl Yang) a thirty-three year old news reporter for a gossip tabloid who works inhuman hours to forget the humiliation of being dumped six years earlier at the altar by her then boyfriend Song Yun Hao (James Wen). At that time both Wu Shuang and Yun Hao were truly in love. She was more than ready (at 27) to finally marry the right guy and to leave spinsterhood behind. Then with neither word nor warning, Yun Hao fails to appear at the church, leaving Wu Shuang crushed. There is an early temptation for the viewer to see Yun Hao as the erring King of the implied title, but plot-wise he does not appear until half-way through the series. Enter the true King: Lucas (Ethan Juan) who is promptly robbed of his bicycle by Wu Shuang who stole it to hurriedly carry an important scoop to her editor in time for a deadline. In the celluloid universe of Taiwanese drama, such a contentious initial meeting between the two leads inevitably if not belatedly to attraction and romance.

The first half of a thirty-four episode series shows Lucas and Wu Shuang in constant bickering over the eight year gap in their ages. She rarely misses an opportunity to call him ""brat,"" ""juvenile,"" and other assorted epithets all of which represent a self-defense mechanism designed to thwart her growing attraction to Lucas. Enter Yun Hao after a six year hiatus who promptly attempts to re-ignite the lost passion that once he shared with Wu Shuang. MY QUEEN does not focus on the meaning of love; rather it attempts to present a far more tricky aspect of it: does love remain constant despite a lengthy separation? The second half of MY QUEEN presents both sides of this complex interplay of a welter of emotions that we call love. First Wu Shuang favors Lucas, then Yun Hao, then dithers back and forth. Toward the end, Wu Shuang definitely announces her preference for Yun Hao, even agreeing to marry him. She unambiguously tells Lucas that he is out of the running. Yet, in the plot-driven world of Taiwanese romantic dramas, any clear statement of intent delivered too soon before the closing credits is often seen as a red herring. The experienced viewer, of course, knows all too well the Byzantine twists of such dramas but still manages to become emotionally involved in Wu Shuang's interactions with Lucas and Yun Hao. The film makes it clear that despite the vast differences in age, temperament, and social standing between the two competing males (which even culminates in a surprisingly brutal beat down to announce the right of the winner for the hand of Wu Shuang) these two men slowly share a grudging respect for one another. Wu Shuang forces herself to look inward at what she really wants before looking outward to evaluate what either of them wants.

MY QUEEN was filmed as a romantic drama midway between the overly farcical romances that so often typify Taiwanese dramas and the serious love dramas of mainland China. Still, there are sufficient irritatingly obvious elements of farce to satisfy the needs of a Taiwanese audience that demands such antics. What emerges after the final episode of MY QUEEN is the surprisingly grim assessment that the ""My"" of an implied King or an explicit Queen is not to be seen in isolation of love as either present or absent but rather whether the love that once empowered a couple may continue to do so, despite the travails of both time and socially-imposed obstacles. MY QUEEN suggests that love requires a continuity of input that if lacking will cause it to wither even in the face of denial by both lovers.",1405987200,2,3703,4.704160246533128
