2556239,4,B000F9WEUU,"Executioners from Shaolin has all the trappings of a classic Shaw Brothers film, but I was a tad disappointed by the large breaks in the action sequences. A large chunk of the film revolves around the lightning fast courtship, wedding, and subsequent child rearing of Hung Hsi Kuan and Lily Li. Oddly edited without transitions or conventional ""5 months later"" , ""10 years later"" type cards, you have to sort of roll with the punches ( yeah, I said it ) but it's well worth the ride.

Essentially the film is building up to a series of fights with Pai Mei and these are the moments you buy the DVD for, and they are well worth it. You can easily see why Tarantino wanted to include the character in his own Kill Bill films.

As for the DVD's presentation, it's really flawless. The audio is crisp and clean, the dubs are classic, all the fight sounds are included and visually it looks as though you're looking at the first print of the film! The only thing you could as for aside from that (considering that the film is shot well before the concept of DVD extras) are trailers, and there are a few included.",1267574400,4,1108,4.426470588235294
2556240,2,B000F9WEUU,"I don't care that, for some reason, this film has acquired a status as a cult classic.  I don't care that director Liu Chia-liang is one of the greatest fight choreographers of all time and later directed the untouchable classic, Drunken Master 2.  The fact is, this is one of the more miserable Shaw Brothers kung-fu films.

It is really quite surprising that the film turned out as bad as it did.  Executioners from Shaolin has one of Shaw's strongest female characters, marvelously portrayed by the charismatic Lily Li, who has a presence that rivals the great Hollywood stars.  This film also has Cheng Cheh stalwart Chen Kuan-tai who, while never exactly a multi-layered actor, is usually solid and likeable, with undeniable physical prowess.  And this film has Lo Lieh in an appealing turn as archvillain Pai Mei.

The problem lies with the script and acting.

Yes, martial-arts films don't exactly excel in these two areas.  But when your main actor switches midway through from Chen Kuan-tai to Wang Yue (not the same as classic screen star Jimmy Wang Yu, who had starred in The One-Armed Swordsman) and the new guy dominates the last half of your film, you'd better make sure he's watchable.  Unfortunately, Wang Yue is possibly the worst actor I've ever seen in a Shaw Brothers film, stiff as a board with his acting and seemingly rushing to do everything.  And I'd thought Alexander Fu Sheng (Shaolin Temple) and Chiang Sheng (Crippled Avengers) were bad!  It doesn't help that Liu Chia-liang appears to be utterly incapable of directing anything except fights at this point, dressing Wang Yue in a costume that makes him look like a cigarette girl from a Benny Hill farce, and having him play Lily Li's son even though she looks only about two years older than he does (and in real life, she was only five years older).  Liu Chia-liang would attempt a similar casting later in Drunken Master 2 when Ti Lung played the father of Jackie Chan while being only eight years Chan's senior.  But the key was in the acting; Ti and Chan managed a chemistry that felt sufficiently like a father-son dynamic that Chan's older appearance could be forgiven.  Here, when Wang Yue bursts out with a ""Dad!"" onscreen, it looks like a six-year-old's first attempt at speaking dialogue -- and I'm going by the original Chinese language here, not English dubs or subtitles.  Shaw Brothers directors have cast actors solely for their fighting/acrobatic abilities before, but Wang Yue may just be their most miserable failure.

The scripting is also a problem.  The plotting is minimal, but acceptable, until Hong Xi-guan (Chen Kuan-tai) steps out of the picture and his son Hong Wen-ding (Wang) takes over the story.  Then the script rams full-force into a wall, as if the writers suddenly decided to dispense with all attempts at making sense.  Almost every Shaw film has a final fight where the hero discovers a way to defeat the bad guy.  Here, there is almost no explanation for how Pai Mei suddenly loses the upper hand.  And the ending to the fight and the story is simply abysmal, utilizing a laughable voice-over to tell the audience, ""The story's done!"" while the onscreen action makes no sense.  Chang Cheh's later films often had more sudden endings with no denouement, but Liu Chia-liang takes that approach to an extreme here that renders the whole film, and the central character, completely insignificant.  After two generations of heroes had fought against Pai Mei for so long, the ending is the ultimate let-down.

I'd still give the film two stars for Lily Li's graceful performance, and some nice physical work from Chen and Lo Lieh in particular.  But honestly, most of this film's strong points were done much better in other films.  Shaolin Temple had much more spectacular fights; The Five Venoms had better characters and setup; Blood Brothers had a strong female performance by Ching Li; The Boxer from Shantung and Crippled Avengers had superior Chen Kuan-tai performances; and if the Hong Xi-guan story is your thing, Heroes Two will serve nicely.  Executioners from Shaolin has some of the most glaring problems of martial-arts films in general, and blows those problems up to spectacularly bad proportions.  You really don't need to resort to this film to get adrenalin-pumping fight action; there are far more worthy films you can peruse.",1265587200,,4359,4.900544959128065
2556241,5,B000F9WEUU,"If you like classic Kung-Fu, then this movie would be considered essential viewing. The beginning is a bit slow but worth the wait. The movie also has a weird part in which the lead characters son is raised as a woman. With that out of the way, the rest of the movie is great. It's worth the price of admission just to watch the son train on the, ""Metal Budda-Esque Meridian Marble Machine?"" Wow! Also great enemy to fight at the end. The movie is sure to entertain, great choreography and great sets made by movie company. Make sure you get a remastered version so the sound is good.",1259107200,2,584,4.36697247706422
2556242,4,B000F9WEUU,"What can you say about a classic?  I've owned this movie for a long time and bought it again when I saw it was remastered.  The only flaw in this movie is that there aren't enough fights.  The story is interesting and easy to follow with Chen Kuan Tai as the legendary Hung Hsi Kuan who escapes the burning Shaolin temple, marries Lily Li, an expert at Crane style and tries to perfect his own Tiger style to take revenge on the white-eyebrow priest, Pai Mei (Lo Lieh).

This is also (one of) the legend(s) of how Hung-Gar kung fu came to be.  The style practiced by the illustrious Wong Fei Hung and the film's director, Lau Kar Leung.

The presentation is nice and clean and makes a big difference.  It's not quite as crisp as some of Shaw's other restorations but I can't possibly imagine anyone complaining about it.  This movie is also proof that refinement and beauty still existed in the popular culture of the 70's.  Recommended.

2556243,3,B000F9WEUU,"Average movie with OK acting, and many questions that needed to be answered to make this a classic!

I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that it was very good, but they did not tell the true story. At first the son was made to look like a little girl, and immediately study his mother's technique. The movie never really answered why the father made that decision,which was a key to the movie. I did like the interaction between the father and son, because that showed how the son wanted to emulate and aspire to follow in his father's footsteps as a warrior. I thought some of the interaction between the father and wife was a  little unnecessary, and had nothing to do with the movie. The romance portion was short-lived, because that was it!!

Many of these movies devalue women once they have kids. They may have been a good warrior, but once the kids come then she becomes nothing but a cook, laundry maiden, and house servant. To me that is sad, because the plot would have worked even more by showing the mother as a great fighter who helped her husband's kung fu by continually fighting him with a different technique to help him grow stronger. Instead she just stood by and kept telling the husband that ""you are not ready to fight Pai-Ma, you must study more!"" If your husband was going to fight somebody who killed your father or brother would you send him out unprepared? NO WAY !!!

Other than these problems, the movie developed very slowly, but was not a total waste, because the scenes with Pai-Ma were all pretty good. This is not a must have, but its definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Pai Ma.",1170892800,5,1639,4.453333333333333

2556299,4,B000F9WEUU,"Executioners from Shaolin seems to me to be a classic example of a standard Shaw Brothers kung fu flick. While it's not the best one out there, it does deliver a pretty good story with all the delicious clich's of vengeance. The movie centers on a man who is dedicated to his Tiger fighting style while his eventual wife is equally as dedicated to her Crane fighting style.

The man's master has been slain by the legendary priest Pai Mei (later featured in the Kill Bill movies). He vows justice and hones his skills for more than a decade, dedicated to exact revenge. Although it's a little lighter on the action, the kung fu in this movie is still pretty great, but this is a more story driven Shaw Bros movie that develops on more than you may expect.",1398556800,2,755,4.431654676258993
8119473,3,B000F9WEUU,"Don't agree at all with all the comments proclaiming this as one of the greatest Kung-Fu classics.  While Pai Mei is excellent, as we expect from most of Lo Lieh's work, the rest of the movie is just blah.  Fights are boring, slow, lack pizzazz.  The hero is lame, story boggs down all the time with needless drama and comedy.  The final fight is pointless and ends midsequence.

The sequel/remake is so much superior that watching this version is just pointless.  Skip it, and go straight to Gordon Liu's Clan of the White Lotus.",1525219200,,530,4.585106382978723
