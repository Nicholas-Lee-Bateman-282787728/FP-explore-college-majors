We really enjoyed it, and my wife found a kindred spirit when she watched the documentary.  Really well done.

3036280,5,B000YV1KVI,"Anyone who has been diagnosed with cancer or cares about someone who has it  will appreciate seeing this movie. This was recommended by a friend who's 10 years clear (never had chemo OR radiation). After going to several ""teams"" of doctors I decided to have removal of the tumor but not the rest of it. Cancer people tend to have acidic bodies (rather than alkaline), there are a TON of great things to do that actually turn cancer cells back into healthy cells, in fact. It's about their environment.  This was one of the first movies watched....in an incredible journey back to health. Mine was an exploration of Reiki, Anatomy of the Spirit, Dying To Be Me...and then a slew of other books and friends I didn't know even loved me that stepped up to the plate to tell me they, too, took the natural route. My diagnosis changed my life ~ for the better. I wish you the same.",1441670400,,875,4.4625

Coming from a family with lots of cancer, I've always had a fear/expectation that it would also be my fate - especially after I reached 30.

3036301,1,B000YV1KVI,"After seeing Kris on Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2, we thought this was going to be along the same lines as that, Forks Over Knives, etc...It wasn't. There's no real information or education or even inspiration around changing your lifestyle for the better through diet or anything. Some people may like it, but if you're expecting it to be like the movies I mentioned, look elsewhere.",1424217600,,381,4.701492537313433

3036306,5,B000YV1KVI,Kris Carr is an inspiration. My 18 yr. old niece just found out she has a rare cancer and after watching this dvd has a new out look and is excited about trying a whole new green way of life..Thanks Kris,1418860800,,203,3.975609756097561

3036308,5,B000YV1KVI,Excellent information. There is so much useful information that anyone can use. It written in a way that it explains very simple but the information is so powerful. A friend of my has cancer and I translated the book for her in Spanish. I highly recommend this book.,1415404800,,266,4.5625

3036311,4,B000YV1KVI,"Great DVD, well worth watching. Did think it was a bit weird that the seller was selling a copy that had belonged to a library - it had the library name on the actual DVD and also the box/cover (I didn't realise this when I was buying it). Did someone who borrowed the DVD not take it back and decide to sell it instead, or did the library choose to sell it? I'm curious. Never bought anything that had belonged to a library before, so kind of weird!",1414368000,,450,4.125
3036322,2,B000YV1KVI,"Not what I was expecting at all. I thought it would be about nutrition and the importance of eating healthy and more on that. Instead it was basically a wishy washy documentary about her emotional journey since her cancer hadn't been deemed a threat yet. There wasn't much to learn from this video, and it didn't come off that inspiring to me. It did drag on quite a bit and had a lot of ""filler"". Not to sound mean but it didn't surprise me to learn she was an actor and her boyfriend a filmmaker. I love other health documentaries like Food Inc,  Hungry for change, Gerson Therapy, A Beautiful Truth, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead. I'd look into those before this movie for sure.",1413936000,,676,4.408

3036328,3,B000YV1KVI,"It would have been quite enjoyable had it not been for all the language. I found the language to be over the top. Would not watch it again for this reason. I'm sure it is suitable for audiences that embrace foul language, but for me it really dampened my spirit.",1410307200,,262,4.26
3036329,4,B000YV1KVI,Great DVD - I'm currently fighting cancer and it was very informative. 4 stars because of all the profanity.,1410048000,,108,4.7368421052631575

3036350,4,B000YV1KVI,"Kris Carr has an amazing story for anyone struggling with a chronic condition, not just cancer.  The film could have gone deeper into her emotional and philosophical journey as well as into what she found that worked for her in the various treatments and remedies that she tried.",1401148800,,279,4.8125
3036351,5,B000YV1KVI,"I do not struggle with cancer, but this is truly a story of strength, courage, and love. Self love and romantic love. Kris could have completely fallen apart when she heard of her diagnosis, but she rose up and decided to heal herself and then spread her journey to others so they could do the same. She teaches prevention and the survival/thriving of cancer. Kris is truly my hero! I love me some green juice!",1399507200,,410,4.48

3036354,3,B000YV1KVI,"Good movie about the alternative treatment for cancer ,but the F word is used profusely throughout, so if that is repulsive to you i would pick another movie to watch that shows alternative healing methods.",1394841600,,206,4.914285714285715
3036355,4,B000YV1KVI,Very motivating insight. A great transformation to watch and some eye opening lessons to learn. Im a fan of Kris'.,1394755200,,114,4.75
3036356,5,B000YV1KVI,.Just goes to show you what the doctors don't know or don't want to tell you about the TOXIC MEDICINES that they prescribe and the great health-giving of natural organic non-GMO food can do for us.,1394496000,,197,4.5
3036357,5,B000YV1KVI,"This information is presented in a crude, yet funny personal experience. Sad and inspirational. It empowers you and shows you what you can do to get better and feel better. I highly recommend it.",1394409600,,195,4.764705882352941
3036358,5,B000YV1KVI,"Captures the emotions that go along with having cancer.

Also does a great job of following Kris on her health journey through the world of alternative medicine.

3036361,5,B000YV1KVI,"I bought this for a relative who was diagnosed with cancer, after having seen it on television.

Kris' journey is heartbreaking, inspiring, and really offers a juicy perspective on life and dealing with illness. I found myself filled with a new lust for life after watching it, and my relative expressed the same thing.",1388620800,,319,4.907407407407407

3036363,5,B000YV1KVI,"If You are looking for an inspiring story, to help you along the road to getting and being healthy, This is it.
I have become vegetarian in January 2013 and tried/completed a 21 day vegan challenge.  I have never felt better, but soon fell back into being vegetarian.  Eating cheese is my weakness.  But after the last few years my parents have gone through lots of health problems and I am so afraid that I will follow in their footsteps.  With cancer running crazy in my family (stomach, lung, ovarian) strokes and type 2 diabetes  I knew that I had to change my fast food, frozen pizza and cake diet.  This year 2014 I am going vegan all the way.  When I did I felt better that I did in my twenties and I am now 45.  Thanks to Kris Carr for giving me that very inspirational story that I needed to give me that extra push.  You even get a yoga routine and other extras on this one, I just watched the movie yesterday when I received it so I will be checking out the rest of this on my next day off.",1388188800,,1001,4.118556701030927

3036365,5,B000YV1KVI,"I will say this was a little anti-climatic but the story is great and gives inspiration to anyone whether looking to get healthy, stay healthy or overcoming a serious illness. Be sure to do a comparison of how she looks at the beginning as compared to the end. Amazing.",1381536000,,269,4.510204081632653
3036366,2,B000YV1KVI,Wasn't exactly what I thought it would be.  Seemed to leave a few questions unanswered and didn't go into much detail in any one area.,1381536000,,134,4.36
3036367,3,B000YV1KVI,"I watched the movie and it was good, but I never need to watch it again. Perhaps I should donate it to the library where I live so that others may enjoy it without paying for it.",1381017600,,178,3.8378378378378377

3036370,4,B000YV1KVI,I discovered Kris while viewing Hungry For Change and wanted to know more about her. I got that for sure. I laughed and cried and learned from her and her cast of characters. I'll be sharing this with my friends.,1370131200,,212,4.325
3036371,5,B000YV1KVI,"I chose a five star rating for Kris Carr's film because I believe she's expressing what the health care professionals don't:  that good whole food and a non-animal diet, plus exercise and relaxation techniques work to heal people's bodies.  I also recommend The China Study as a more technical report on whole food, plant-based eating which supports Kris Carr's film.

Please also get Kris Carr's cookbooks -- I have her Crazy Sexy Diet and it's packed with great information about health which she has become an expert in, as well as awesome recipes.

Thanks, from a person who has gone mostly vegan since Valentine's Day 2013!",1367452800,,628,4.89622641509434
3036372,5,B000YV1KVI,I had already viewed this film prior to purchasing. That's how valuable I consider the inspirational message provided. Of course not everyone has the same financial luxuries the subject of  this documentary has been afforded.,1366156800,,225,5.428571428571429
3036373,5,B000YV1KVI,I am a survivor of breast cancer. I wish I had known this DVD before hand but it was still useful and great to watch I've sat down numerous of times to re-watch. Would recommend to anyone!!... Love her also.,1366156800,,207,4.2
3036374,5,B000YV1KVI,"I learned about Kris Carr from a breast cancer survivor after I was finishing adjuvant chemo for a rare uterine sarcoma last year.  My friend insisted I needed this book and I reluctantly went ahead and bought it thinking it was ""just another"" dictionary of things that did not apply to me.  Well, was I ever glad I did buy CSCT!  Kris speaks the language of girls with sass, humor and wonderful tips to deal with the good, bad and ugly.  Like Kris, I was adrift dealing with something unknown and trying to balance friends, family and work while educating myself by attending ""cancer university"".  Though I finished treatments, I'm still processing my journey and often read Kris's books, they make me LOL.  I have shared it with other C girls and sarcoma people.  Kris's enthusiasm for life, love and good food is contagious.  She has a great website!",1364428800,,853,4.677852348993288
3036375,5,B000YV1KVI,"It made me feel that I'm not alone in my concerns that I have as a young cancer survivor (diagnosed at 31 and currently age 33) living with cancer as a chronic illness.  Like Kris, I currently am just monitored by frequent MRIs, but every day, I think about this disease and how it has and may impact my life, relationships, emotions, etc.  Although the cancer is different, Kris's emotional struggles are so similar to what I would imagine ALL young survivors must feel.  Her way of dealing with it is very encouraging!  I would also recommend showing (at least the first part) to a person with whom you might be in a serious relationship.  I'm not sure, but I would think this would help the significant other understand what you often feel but may not show as a survivor!  She shows that there is hope...even for love...as a person with chronic cancer!",1360886400,,855,4.555555555555555
3036376,2,B000YV1KVI,"In 2003 an actress, age 32, learns she has incurable cancer.  The 2007 documentary CRAZY SEXY CANCER follows four years of her life with the illness.

Directed by its subject Kris Carr, CRAZY SEXY CANCER aims to inspire and judging from most reviewers who posted here before me, it succeeds with its depiction of Carr's quest to increase her odds of living a long life. While CRAZY SEXY CANCER will hold your attention, in the hands of another director it could deliver more.  For example, in what I find the film's most compelling moment Carr wonders if drinking from a stream as a child caused the disease. If CRAZY SEXY CANCER addressed such factors more forcefully instead focusing on diet, exercise, and other ways we see Carr try to ""take that crumb and turn it into a cake,"" as if her health is that much under her control, it could be more than just a diary of a victim.  From chemical waste in the water to carcinogens in cosmetics, so much of what we should not have to worry about can lead to cancer and other diseases, and CRAZY SEXY CANCER makes it sound too much as if the responsibility is all or most of the patient's.

As I write this on the 15th of February in 2013, it is ten years and one day since Kris Carr learned of her cancer.  Here's wishing her many more years - and hoping for a more hard-hitting sequel.",1360886400,,1332,4.394308943089431
3036377,5,B000YV1KVI,"This has been another great tool to share with my community and my clients.
I have lent it out to dozens of clients and bought it as gifts for others.
The reviews have always been, as mine are - positively positive.",1360454400,,215,4.2682926829268295
3036378,5,B000YV1KVI,"I have become a bit of a Wellness freak (or Warrior is you may) and I have spent lucrative hours, days, weeks, and months researching everything and anything in regards to Wellness, Holistic health, and traditional Chinese medicine. This dvd was merely another educational tool in my library and I'm glad I picked it up. Not only is it educational, it is inspiring, motivating, touching, and it opens you up to a whole other world of medicine. It shows you that there is not just this one way, but many others. It is a great documentary to view and after you see it, you will get an itch to explore just what other alternative means of health there is,",1360281600,,652,4.487394957983193
3036379,5,B000YV1KVI,"I loved this movie.  It has literally changed my life.  I also read her book Crazy, Sexy, Diet and my family and I are enjoying our journey to a healthier life.  She reminds me not to take life too seriously but to seriously live it at the same time.",1357776000,,250,4.061224489795919
3036380,5,B000YV1KVI,"This was a great flick about all the trials and tribulations of how Kris Carr, and others, fought their battles with cancer. This movie is very funny at times and definitely not a ""downer""!",1356307200,,189,4.588235294117647

3036382,5,B000YV1KVI,"this book was so informative for me that I had a hard time putting it down.
I learned so much from reading this book.
I will say this, Kriss Carr is an inspiration to me, she is a sweetheart.
I am learning more and more about how to detox my body, change my attitude about my health and my own outlook on life.
As I said, Kriss Carr is an inspiration to me, just as she is to millions of others who follow her guideance on healthy eating.",1353974400,,438,3.9886363636363638
3036383,4,B000YV1KVI,"This movie was entertaining and inspiring but not what I expected. To be fair, I thought Kris would spend more time talking about the nutritional details of her healing strategy. She covered the basics, like the importance of eating clean & raw, but most of the time was spent discussing other options she explored before finding what worked. SHE is inspiring and so is HER story, but she also introduced us to a number of other cancer patients to talk about their journeys. That wasn't as interesting to me because they are going through standard treatments as opposed to incorporating diet and exercise. But again, this review reflects my personal interests.

Bottom line: If you're primarily interested in watching a documentary about cancer, this is great. If your focus is nutrition, buy Crazy Sexy Diet instead.",1350432000,,817,5.007352941176471

I watched this film in hopes of being inspired and I was, by a few of the women, but not by the main subject. I realize that this sounds quite INsensitive, but I didn't see how this woman's experience was documentary-worthy. She never seemed to feel crummy other than emotionally, i.e., feeling sorry for herself, never had to deal with chemotherapy....yes, she had many tumors but at no point in the film did they pose much of a threat other than psychologically. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad she's okay and I understand how scary the situation must have been, but it just struck me as a very feeble example of an experience with cancer. Another woman in the film, I believe her name is Jackie, was on 17 medications. I don't recall the subject having had to take ANY drugs.",1340409600,,899,4.487804878048781

I watched the entire film in one sitting, which is a rare thing for me to do with the many distractions of everyday life, and couldn't believe how much Carr's positive attitude hit me. I've had a crappy week, and though my trials this week have been nothing compared to Carr's battle with cancer, it's given me a positive energy to deal with my problems.

The film itself goes from Carr finding out she has cancer, and spans the next three or so years of her life and how she refuses to take no for an answer. She also follows the lives of several other women with cancer, all of who also do everything then can to, as they say in the film, **** cancer. (So warning, there is a little bad language in the movie, which doesn't bother me at all, but you may not want to have children within hearing distance while you watch it.) It also goes into Carr's dietary changes, (which is how I first got introduced to Carr's work.) It also goes through the changes of Carr's relationship with her camera man, which goes from friends to marriage, and just seems to give the film a happy ending.

I would go for treatment everyday (and still do) but when I leave the hospital and go home, nothing I did at home would be beneficial towards fighting cancer. I felt like my doctors were doing the work but that I wasn't putting in any additional effort, just going with the flow. I wanted a resource that was also geared towards young adults battling cancer. This documentary is about a young adults' cancer journey and not just sitting by as doctors performed tests on her, but by also being pro-active and taking an important role in her healing journey, through nutrition and eastern forms of healing. This documentary has helped to inspire me to make a change in my own life, outside of cancer, so that it may benefit me and change the course that my disease has taken. This documentary for me is one step to seeing my healing journey in a whole new light and to helping me become more aware of what I can do to help myself.

3036394,5,B000YV1KVI,"This is a great resource for those who are themselves or with loved ones facing cancer.  This documentary explores the choices and journey of a young woman with a cancer diagnoses. She decides to open up to answers beyond the convention offerings of the medical industry, and basically ends up doing well by following a whole foods diet incorporating living foods and regenerative juices- which are the foundation and bedrock of traditional naturopathy, and offered to anyone through numerous seminars as well as centers and therapeutic approaches such as Hippocrates Institute, Ann Wigmore training, Gerson therapies- its basically all the same- to support your immune system and general balance , while embarking on tissue cleansing through a regenerative whole foods plant based diet.

There is one scene where she visits an Expo, which lumps obviously well- trained practitioners in with people selling crystals and gimmicks -  and that sends the wrong message to the mainstream- there are thousands of serious , well trained, highly experienced and educated healing arts practitioners who offer and facilitate methods that work, so I was sad to see them portrayed with clowns and crystal hawkers- it sends the wrong message, and misinforms - although those expo's still exist, there are better ways to inform ourselves about traditional naturopathy, living foods healing diets, and the professional benefits of bodywork therapies, herbs, hydrotherapy, and natural medicine.

Yet the overall inspirational message of this story cannot be beat!  This is an important, utterly life changing topic and deserves full exploration, not the passive victimization so common in our culture.

I also highly recommend the perspectives offered in ""Healing Cancer""  (Mike Anderson), ""Dying to Have Known"", and ""The Beautiful Truth"".  Although everyone is free to make their own choices, thankfully we are learning that there is a ""cancer industry"" with an agenda to fear-monger people into making quick and radical choices which may destroy their innate healing capacities rather than support them.  While this is not the message of this particular film, one can perhaps read between the lines, as it were- Kris avoids these ""treatments"" and ends up being the one with vitality, vigor, and strength to run, power walk, do yoga, and engage in creating her life without interruption beyond the initial stages in 2003 of inquiry.  I wonder - would her doctors have said what they did had they not been on film, under those circumstances?  Or would they have pressured her into debilitating chemo, surgery, radiation, and poo-pooed juicing and live foods as the doctors in the above mentioned films did ??  I recommend seeing them all- easy enough to do with media available from amazon via digital download/pay per view.

The attitude is very uplifting for a person experiencing cancer, as long as you can accept the author's 'non-religious' way of dealing with her diagnosis.  Some readers with cancer may not be able to accept a person who didn't have to have surgery, chemo or radiation as representative of their own cancer journeys, and may not relate to this author.  Most of the author's avant garde diet and bowel cleansing routines to hold her cancer at bay were over the top for me, but if you have an open mind and are able to read around her ideas you disagree with, there are many good tips and life-affirming philosophies that make this a worthwhile read for a cancer patient/survivor.",1251936000,,818,4.476510067114094

My friend Marganne kept telling me about the Craze Sexy Cancer lady she was on TV, and wanted me to read the books.  It took me months to find the courage to start reading about cancer.  I thought the more I read, the more I researched, the more I'd see that I was in big trouble.  Well, I finally got the books six months later, and my life has been turned around.  So many things clicked with me, that I can say, WoW, Kris totally gets it.

since ready her book, a had to make some changes to Team Diane!!  I let go of my oncologist at my primary hospital, whose bedside manner didn't jive with me, and now see a second year oncology Fellow, who works under the first oncologist.  He is so patient with me, hugs me when I need it, and is not afraid to hold my hand and look me in the eye and explain what is happening to me.  As it turns out my new Main Man at Penn State Hershey Medical Center was in residency with one of my two oncologist I see at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.  My Team calls each other with ease to discuss my case.  Thank you Chris for giving me the strength to let go of a very, highly trained oncologist, for someone who is also highly trained and educated, genuinely cares about me.

This is just one of the many truly life changes experiences that have come out of the CRAZY, SEXY, CANCER series.  I've got my GalPal's, who comes to chemo with me, and turn it into a party.  I try to turn everything I do into a little party.

The film documents not only Karr's own struggles but those of several other young women who have taken a kick-a** attitude towards battling their disease and finding meaning within the harsh new reality they have been dealt.  Because Karr is so young, beautiful, and surrounded by loving family and friends, she makes an arguably atypical protagonist with advantages other cancer patients don't have.  But more power to her -- she uses her abundance of energy and charisma to document with grit and honesty some extraordinary individuals and some fascinating aspects of cancer treatment, both conventional and alternative.

3036409,4,B000YV1KVI,"She never really does reveal what makes cancer sexy, but surely part of it is her developing romance with the man behind the camera, Brian Fassett.  Brian makes himself indispensable to Kris, and is at her side no matter what  New Age diet she tries next.  Even when she's down, he stays up.  In fact Brian hardly shows any emotions in the video, he's just a steady sort of man for a bubbly and optimistic woman.

Her dilemma is a tragic one: she has an inoperable and untreatable cancer that paradoxically enough doesn't need treatment because its growth is undetectably slow.  What's the sense is subjecting oneself to nauseating chemo when, in fact, you're doing fine without it?  And yet she sometimes suffers from existential panic, for even though she's not in pain or even ""sick,"" she's a walking time bomb and one of these days that cancer might spread.

She's a lot like Chloe Sevigny and no wonder she wasn't getting many parts as an actress, she was probably losing all the good ones to Chloe.  My wife says I'm crazy and that Kris Carr is charismatic.  However, she's not charismatic enough to make me eat 80 percent raw foods and start juicing, and she becomes sort of johnny one note about how delicious juices are and how much she's in love.  Of course she's delighted to be alive, and she surrounds herself with other young women stricken with cancer and they are her posse (didn't see any of them at her wedding though, maybe they're just illness friends and not wedding guest type friends).  Sad to see the brilliant black playwright struggling with getting one final play done!  We learned that the woman, Oni Faida Lampley, a brilliant actress and so great in the Kevin Costner movie DRAGONFLY, died last month and this movie is a great tribute to her spirit, though her death of course is not covered in this tape.  Maybe there will be a sequel to talk about those young women for whom the diets and juicing do not help.

On an amusing note, Kris Carr has many Julia Roberts-style montages of herself doing funny walks across the screen, sometimes breaking into the ""funky chicken,"" in an assortment of size 4 play clothes and kooky hats.  I counted and there are 11 such montages in the film, more than any other movie I ever remember seeing.  A record?",1211673600,,2275,4.60545905707196

The cancer is so rare (not to mention hard to pronounce) that every treatment offered to her is experimental. Fortunately, the cancer does not metastasize quickly. Seizing the opportunity, she becomes her own ""health guru"" and starts to go on a journey of alternative medicine. The reason I was attracted to this is because it features briefly one of the people who I've been studying, a microbiologist by the name of Dr. Robert Young. His theories on ""the new biology"" are explained in the books that he writes. I also, as a side note, recommend that, if you are interested, to read books like ""The pH Miracle.""

Instead it was basically a wishy washy documentary about her emotional journey since her cancer hadn't been deemed a threat yet. There wasn't much to learn from this video, and it didn't come off that inspiring to me. It did drag on quite a bit and had a lot of ""filler"". Not to sound mean but it didn't surprise me to learn she was an actor and her boyfriend a filmmaker.

But after the last few years my parents have gone through lots of health problems and I am so afraid that I will follow in their footsteps.  With cancer running crazy in my family (stomach, lung, ovarian) strokes and type 2 diabetes  I knew that I had to change my fast food, frozen pizza and cake diet.

I also recommend The China Study as a more technical report on whole food, plant-based eating which supports Kris Carr's film.

Please also get Kris Carr's cookbooks -- I have her Crazy Sexy Diet and it's packed with great information about health which she has become an expert in, as well as awesome recipes.

Well, was I ever glad I did buy CSCT!  Kris speaks the language of girls with sass, humor and wonderful tips to deal with the good, bad and ugly.  Like Kris, I was adrift dealing with something unknown and trying to balance friends, family and work while educating myself by attending ""cancer university"".  Though I finished treatments, I'm still processing my journey and often read Kris's books, they make me LOL.  I have shared it with other C girls and sarcoma people.

Like Kris, I currently am just monitored by frequent MRIs, but every day, I think about this disease and how it has and may impact my life, relationships, emotions, etc.  Although the cancer is different, Kris's emotional struggles are so similar to what I would imagine ALL young survivors must feel.  Her way of dealing with it is very encouraging!  I would also recommend showing (at least the first part) to a person with whom you might be in a serious relationship.  I'm not sure, but I would think this would help the significant other understand what you often feel but may not show as a survivor!  She shows that there is hope...even for love...as a person with chronic cancer!",1360886400,,855,4.555555555555555
3270873,2,B000YV1KVI,"In 2003 an actress, age 32, learns she has incurable cancer.  The 2007 documentary CRAZY SEXY CANCER follows four years of her life with the illness.

Directed by its subject Kris Carr, CRAZY SEXY CANCER aims to inspire and judging from most reviewers who posted here before me, it succeeds with its depiction of Carr's quest to increase her odds of living a long life. While CRAZY SEXY CANCER will hold your attention, in the hands of another director it could deliver more.  For example, in what I find the film's most compelling moment Carr wonders if drinking from a stream as a child caused the disease. If CRAZY SEXY CANCER addressed such factors more forcefully instead focusing on diet, exercise, and other ways we see Carr try to ""take that crumb and turn it into a cake,"" as if her health is that much under her control, it could be more than just a diary of a victim.  From chemical waste in the water to carcinogens in cosmetics, so much of what we should not have to worry about can lead to cancer and other diseases, and CRAZY SEXY CANCER makes it sound too much as if the responsibility is all or most of the patient's.

As I write this on the 15th of February in 2013, it is ten years and one day since Kris Carr learned of her cancer.  Here's wishing her many more years - and hoping for a more hard-hitting sequel.",1360886400,,1332,4.394308943089431

Not only is it educational, it is inspiring, motivating, touching, and it opens you up to a whole other world of medicine. It shows you that there is not just this one way, but many others.

3270880,4,B000YV1KVI,"This movie was entertaining and inspiring but not what I expected. To be fair, I thought Kris would spend more time talking about the nutritional details of her healing strategy. She covered the basics, like the importance of eating clean & raw, but most of the time was spent discussing other options she explored before finding what worked. SHE is inspiring and so is HER story, but she also introduced us to a number of other cancer patients to talk about their journeys. That wasn't as interesting to me because they are going through standard treatments as opposed to incorporating diet and exercise. But again, this review reflects my personal interests.

Bottom line: If you're primarily interested in watching a documentary about cancer, this is great. If your focus is nutrition, buy Crazy Sexy Diet instead.",1350432000,,817,5.007352941176471

I watched this film in hopes of being inspired and I was, by a few of the women, but not by the main subject. I realize that this sounds quite INsensitive, but I didn't see how this woman's experience was documentary-worthy. She never seemed to feel crummy other than emotionally, i.e., feeling sorry for herself, never had to deal with chemotherapy....yes, she had many tumors but at no point in the film did they pose much of a threat other than psychologically. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad she's okay and I understand how scary the situation must have been, but it just struck me as a very feeble example of an experience with cancer. Another woman in the film, I believe her name is Jackie, was on 17 medications. I don't recall the subject having had to take ANY drugs.",1340409600,,899,4.487804878048781

The bonus section which is for an additional ninety minutes or so is extremely educational in regard to diet, meditation, yoga, exercise, nutritional value of vegetables which can offer you a different perspective of life through a completely different lens, an individual with a rare cancer whose cancer has mind of its own and lives inside Kris's body. I do not have cancer or any disease but this is a documentary well worth watching with excellent interviews with established professionals and doctors who answer questions which will be helpful for anyone with or without cancer. Good luck to Kris. Bravo.",1328227200,,822,5.007299270072993

I watched the entire film in one sitting, which is a rare thing for me to do with the many distractions of everyday life, and couldn't believe how much Carr's positive attitude hit me. I've had a crappy week, and though my trials this week have been nothing compared to Carr's battle with cancer, it's given me a positive energy to deal with my problems.

The film itself goes from Carr finding out she has cancer, and spans the next three or so years of her life and how she refuses to take no for an answer. She also follows the lives of several other women with cancer, all of who also do everything then can to, as they say in the film, **** cancer. (So warning, there is a little bad language in the movie, which doesn't bother me at all, but you may not want to have children within hearing distance while you watch it.) It also goes into Carr's dietary changes, (which is how I first got introduced to Carr's work.) It also goes through the changes of Carr's relationship with her camera man, which goes from friends to marriage, and just seems to give the film a happy ending.

I also love that the film came in a recyclable and biodegradable DVD case.",1323648000,,1558,5.101960784313725

3270890,5,B000YV1KVI,"As someone currently fighting cancer, I had been looking for almost anything in regards to fighting cancer on your own terms and being pro-active in your health care. I would go for treatment everyday (and still do) but when I leave the hospital and go home, nothing I did at home would be beneficial towards fighting cancer. I felt like my doctors were doing the work but that I wasn't putting in any additional effort, just going with the flow. I wanted a resource that was also geared towards young adults battling cancer. This documentary is about a young adults' cancer journey and not just sitting by as doctors performed tests on her, but by also being pro-active and taking an important role in her healing journey, through nutrition and eastern forms of healing. This documentary has helped to inspire me to make a change in my own life, outside of cancer, so that it may benefit me and change the course that my disease has taken. This documentary for me is one step to seeing my healing journey in a whole new light and to helping me become more aware of what I can do to help myself. I highly recommend this movie for cancer fighters, survivors, caregivers, friends and family of those with cancer and anyone who wants to be able to better  understand the opportunities that are available for us to become active participants in our health.",1304726400,,1352,4.633333333333334
3270891,5,B000YV1KVI,"This is a great resource for those who are themselves or with loved ones facing cancer.  This documentary explores the choices and journey of a young woman with a cancer diagnoses. She decides to open up to answers beyond the convention offerings of the medical industry, and basically ends up doing well by following a whole foods diet incorporating living foods and regenerative juices- which are the foundation and bedrock of traditional naturopathy, and offered to anyone through numerous seminars as well as centers and therapeutic approaches such as Hippocrates Institute, Ann Wigmore training, Gerson therapies- its basically all the same- to support your immune system and general balance , while embarking on tissue cleansing through a regenerative whole foods plant based diet.

There is one scene where she visits an Expo, which lumps obviously well- trained practitioners in with people selling crystals and gimmicks -  and that sends the wrong message to the mainstream- there are thousands of serious , well trained, highly experienced and educated healing arts practitioners who offer and facilitate methods that work, so I was sad to see them portrayed with clowns and crystal hawkers- it sends the wrong message, and misinforms - although those expo's still exist, there are better ways to inform ourselves about traditional naturopathy, living foods healing diets, and the professional benefits of bodywork therapies, herbs, hydrotherapy, and natural medicine.

Yet the overall inspirational message of this story cannot be beat!  This is an important, utterly life changing topic and deserves full exploration, not the passive victimization so common in our culture.

I also highly recommend the perspectives offered in ""Healing Cancer""  (Mike Anderson), ""Dying to Have Known"", and ""The Beautiful Truth"".  Although everyone is free to make their own choices, thankfully we are learning that there is a ""cancer industry"" with an agenda to fear-monger people into making quick and radical choices which may destroy their innate healing capacities rather than support them.  While this is not the message of this particular film, one can perhaps read between the lines, as it were- Kris avoids these ""treatments"" and ends up being the one with vitality, vigor, and strength to run, power walk, do yoga, and engage in creating her life without interruption beyond the initial stages in 2003 of inquiry.  I wonder - would her doctors have said what they did had they not been on film, under those circumstances?  Or would they have pressured her into debilitating chemo, surgery, radiation, and poo-pooed juicing and live foods as the doctors in the above mentioned films did ??  I recommend seeing them all- easy enough to do with media available from amazon via digital download/pay per view.

The attitude is very uplifting for a person experiencing cancer, as long as you can accept the author's 'non-religious' way of dealing with her diagnosis.  Some readers with cancer may not be able to accept a person who didn't have to have surgery, chemo or radiation as representative of their own cancer journeys, and may not relate to this author.  Most of the author's avant garde diet and bowel cleansing routines to hold her cancer at bay were over the top for me, but if you have an open mind and are able to read around her ideas you disagree with, there are many good tips and life-affirming philosophies that make this a worthwhile read for a cancer patient/survivor.",1251936000,,818,4.476510067114094

My friend Marganne kept telling me about the Craze Sexy Cancer lady she was on TV, and wanted me to read the books.  It took me months to find the courage to start reading about cancer.  I thought the more I read, the more I researched, the more I'd see that I was in big trouble.  Well, I finally got the books six months later, and my life has been turned around.  So many things clicked with me, that I can say, WoW, Kris totally gets it.

since ready her book, a had to make some changes to Team Diane!!  I let go of my oncologist at my primary hospital, whose bedside manner didn't jive with me, and now see a second year oncology Fellow, who works under the first oncologist.  He is so patient with me, hugs me when I need it, and is not afraid to hold my hand and look me in the eye and explain what is happening to me.  As it turns out my new Main Man at Penn State Hershey Medical Center was in residency with one of my two oncologist I see at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.  My Team calls each other with ease to discuss my case.  Thank you Chris for giving me the strength to let go of a very, highly trained oncologist, for someone who is also highly trained and educated, genuinely cares about me.

This is just one of the many truly life changes experiences that have come out of the CRAZY, SEXY, CANCER series.  I've got my GalPal's, who comes to chemo with me, and turn it into a party.  I try to turn everything I do into a little party.

The film documents not only Karr's own struggles but those of several other young women who have taken a kick-a** attitude towards battling their disease and finding meaning within the harsh new reality they have been dealt.  Because Karr is so young, beautiful, and surrounded by loving family and friends, she makes an arguably atypical protagonist with advantages other cancer patients don't have.  But more power to her -- she uses her abundance of energy and charisma to document with grit and honesty some extraordinary individuals and some fascinating aspects of cancer treatment, both conventional and alternative.

3270906,4,B000YV1KVI,"She never really does reveal what makes cancer sexy, but surely part of it is her developing romance with the man behind the camera, Brian Fassett.  Brian makes himself indispensable to Kris, and is at her side no matter what  New Age diet she tries next.  Even when she's down, he stays up.  In fact Brian hardly shows any emotions in the video, he's just a steady sort of man for a bubbly and optimistic woman.

Her dilemma is a tragic one: she has an inoperable and untreatable cancer that paradoxically enough doesn't need treatment because its growth is undetectably slow.  What's the sense is subjecting oneself to nauseating chemo when, in fact, you're doing fine without it?  And yet she sometimes suffers from existential panic, for even though she's not in pain or even ""sick,"" she's a walking time bomb and one of these days that cancer might spread.

She's a lot like Chloe Sevigny and no wonder she wasn't getting many parts as an actress, she was probably losing all the good ones to Chloe.  My wife says I'm crazy and that Kris Carr is charismatic.  However, she's not charismatic enough to make me eat 80 percent raw foods and start juicing, and she becomes sort of johnny one note about how delicious juices are and how much she's in love.  Of course she's delighted to be alive, and she surrounds herself with other young women stricken with cancer and they are her posse (didn't see any of them at her wedding though, maybe they're just illness friends and not wedding guest type friends).  Sad to see the brilliant black playwright struggling with getting one final play done!  We learned that the woman, Oni Faida Lampley, a brilliant actress and so great in the Kevin Costner movie DRAGONFLY, died last month and this movie is a great tribute to her spirit, though her death of course is not covered in this tape.  Maybe there will be a sequel to talk about those young women for whom the diets and juicing do not help.

On an amusing note, Kris Carr has many Julia Roberts-style montages of herself doing funny walks across the screen, sometimes breaking into the ""funky chicken,"" in an assortment of size 4 play clothes and kooky hats.  I counted and there are 11 such montages in the film, more than any other movie I ever remember seeing.  A record?",1211673600,,2275,4.60545905707196

3270909,4,B000YV1KVI,"In this fun little documentary, actress/director Kris Carr is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that infects her lungs and liver. The cancer is so rare (not to mention hard to pronounce) that every treatment offered to her is experimental. Fortunately, the cancer does not metastasize quickly. Seizing the opportunity, she becomes her own ""health guru"" and starts to go on a journey of alternative medicine. The reason I was attracted to this is because it features briefly one of the people who I've been studying, a microbiologist by the name of Dr. Robert Young. His theories on ""the new biology"" are explained in the books that he writes. I also, as a side note, recommend that, if you are interested, to read books like ""The pH Miracle."" Or look up Dr. Alex Guerrero or Dr. Christopher Vasey. But I'm getting off the subject. I recommend this, but because of the language and content involved, this is NOT a family-friendly movie. Also, something that I found a bit irritating was that it came in a eco-friendly box. Now, I'm all about recycling and closing down the landfills and not polluting and all, but it was something I wasn't really expecting and it kind of made it hard to get the DVD out of the case without...breaking it.

Three words: Get this DVD. Six words: Even if you don't have cancer.

Kris Carr has done the miraculous: She has turned the whole conversation of cancer and healing and empowerment, and creative control upside down to invite all of us to look at our lives and even mortality through brave, fresh, fun, authentic eyes. She's a delight to watch; informative to listen to; an inspiration to emulate. She may actually make me do the unthinkable: shove kale down the feed tube of my juicer and give it a try.
