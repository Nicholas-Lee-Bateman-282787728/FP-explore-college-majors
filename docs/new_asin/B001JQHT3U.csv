8313551,1,B001JQHT3U,"I advise you, please do not purchase this DVD.
You are wasting your money on 4 episodes, a locker poster, and some interactive game.
Season 1 of Life with Derek is out and for just about $5 more you can get ALL the episodes of season 1 vs the 4. You also get the locker poster with Season 1, PLUS more interviews and behind the scenes things.",1259452800,6,342,4.119402985074627
8313552,1,B001JQHT3U,"I just wanted to second Denwar's review.  Entirely.  This is about a third of season one (for at least half the price, only two dollars less right now) with the only extra being a poster and an interactive DVD game.  Seriously?  We all know what this really is: a lame attempt at getting more money out of us for the same stuff we've already bought (or will buy), and a way to further stall the release of the season DVD.  But we're on to you.  And if this doesn't sell well, like Denwar said, they will probably put out the season 2 DVD faster.  Besides, why waste your money?",1233446400,8,577,4.238532110091743
8313553,1,B001JQHT3U,"This looks like a repackage of only 4 episodes from Season 1, which is available at Amazon right now as a complete set of 13 episodes plus extras for a couple dollars more.  BUY THE WHOLE SET so we can see a release of Seasons 2 and 3.
This is an extremely entertaining show imported from Canada.  Well written, acted with great enthusiasm by the cast of, I assume, native Canadians.  Refreshingly fun family entertainment!",1232928000,11,423,4.613333333333333
