5856532,5,B00DUGC29S,"Fast delivery, great workout, could use a bit more active music... but it cannot have it all!  It is fun and it is effective.  I highly recommended...Get it you will love it too...",1382140800,5,180,4.424242424242424
5856533,5,B00DUGC29S,This is a great workout dvd you feel good doing and you learn great moves. Karina and Kim are great teachers,1381622400,9,108,4.190476190476191
5856534,5,B00DUGC29S,"I like all my DWTS dvds, but this one is a little different, in some cases a little more advanced because there is quicker steps.  I do love it though, and feel like I get a good workout every time.",1381622400,7,198,3.95
5856535,5,B00DUGC29S,I will really recommend this video to anyone who want to learn how to dance salsa & lose weight.,1423267200,,96,4.105263157894737
5856536,5,B00DUGC29S,Arrived quickly!  Now I need to actually use it!,1417564800,,48,4.333333333333333
5856537,1,B00DUGC29S,Not as fun as I thought it would be and is a little hard to follow,1414540800,,66,3.1875
5856538,3,B00DUGC29S,Not as good as would have hoped for.,1414281600,,36,3.625
5856539,4,B00DUGC29S,Good video but they do move fast so it was hard to keep up if you are first starting out like me.,1412553600,,97,3.4545454545454546
5856540,5,B00DUGC29S,I absolutely love my DVD. It came in record time and I didn't have to pay for fast shipping I paid for regular shipping.,1406592000,,120,4.041666666666667
5856541,1,B00DUGC29S,I thought it would do a full body workout but it is mostly legs.  After five minutes my legs felt like rubber.  It's good to learn latin dancing but that is not what I wanted.,1405641600,,175,3.9714285714285715
5856542,5,B00DUGC29S,"This video is taught by two professionally trained dancers and it shows. I really enjoy learning the moves.
Sometimes some moves are so fast that they are hard to keep up with, but the teachers challenge you in a very positive way. It is always fun and gives you a great work out. It also works on balance and posture  which is valuable too. In summary, this video is a wonderful way to get in shape and learn a few dance moves..",1403568000,3,429,4.2317073170731705
5856543,5,B00DUGC29S,"I have done this workout twice, and I love it!  I am about 30 pounds overweight and am trying to get back in shape.  I have a couple other workout dvds, but I really don't enjoy them.  They are walking aerobics or circuit training, and I dread doing them, but this workout is so fun and motivating.  I think the instructors do a great job teaching the steps, and I have so much fun trying to keep up.  I can't go quite as fast as them yet, but they are very motivating, and it gives me something to work up to.  This dvd is so great, that I have decided to try some of the other dancing with the stars workouts.  I can only hope they are as fun and motivating as this one!  I get a great workout, and as soon as I get back in shape, I am definitely going dancing!",1398124800,4,763,3.9411764705882355
5856544,4,B00DUGC29S,"I like this DVD. I am new to dancing and therefore I find it to be a little bit difficult to follow. But overall, it is excellent and fun exercise rutine.",1397779200,,154,4.0
5856545,5,B00DUGC29S,"I have not finished with this video yet but it gets easier as I learn more. It is not easy, it is fast paced and challenging. I love this because I have always loved the dancy exercise moves.",1395014400,2,191,4.052631578947368
5856546,1,B00DUGC29S,"I couldn't stand listening to her voice number one. It got on my nerves. Seems petty but when you are trying to concentrate on the steps it is easy to understand. Most importantly, there were a lot of flamboyant moves. It was nothing like Zumba! I was highly disappointed. I was too busy trying to figure out the steps and got very frustrated.",1393027200,3,343,4.4603174603174605
5856547,2,B00DUGC29S,"Very disappointed with this gimmick.  It is very cheaply produced.  Many times, you can only see the feet of the instructor (if you could call Kym or Karina an instructor on this DVD - more of showoffs.)  There are 4 segments and you can't run them back to back.  You have to stop and get your remote and click and then click and then click.  If you don't like one segment, you have to fast forward through the entire thing to play another segment.  There is NO warm up and neither Kym nor Karina explain the moves very well in advance or advise how not to do something.  I predict a lot of injuries because of the fast way they go through everything to try to make it a ""workout"".  Will be selling this one on Ebay for whatever I can get for it!",1392681600,2,746,4.131944444444445
5856548,1,B00DUGC29S,They move entirely too fast with the instructions. Absolutely no way to figure it out. They show you how to do the move once but no direction. A waste of money! Should have reviewed it first. Don't bother with this one!,1391990400,2,219,4.365853658536586
5856549,4,B00DUGC29S,They go a little bit fast for beginners but it is easy to pick up on. Overall a good tape.,1390176000,,90,3.55
5856550,1,B00DUGC29S,They move entirely too fast for beginners!  Waste of my money!  It sits on my TV shelf and collects dust!!!!  Should return it!,1389052800,2,127,4.434782608695652
5856551,5,B00DUGC29S,My husband and children enjoy dancing with the DVD just as much as I do. It is soooo much fun!,1387497600,,94,3.75
5856552,1,B00DUGC29S,"I really liked another Dancing with the Stars (Dance away the pounds) so thought I'd try this DVD for variety but was very disappointed by it. The instruction introduces the steps too slowly so that your heart rate drops right down, yet offers no repetition to practice before accelerating to full speed before you even fully understand the pattern. You can't follow so you're just floundering around trying to figure it out, and it slows right down again to a crawl (too slowly!) to introduce the next pattern, with the whole cycle repeating itself. It's not a workout, it's an exercise in frustration. For reference, I do a lot of dance workouts (i.e. ""Dance with Julianne: Cardio Ballroom"" and ""Dance with Julianne:Just Dance"" and pick up dance steps quickly and easily, but the instruction and pacing of this DVD, combined with the worse camera angles possible at the most crucial  of times makes it a poor workout and no fun at all. Pass on it, it's a waste of your money.",1387324800,14,977,4.713450292397661
5856553,1,B00DUGC29S,"DANCE instructors should teach dance and NOT exercise!  If you want to learn to dance, this is the DVD for you.  Did not get a good workout due to the fact that your trying to learn dance moves.  I would not not recommend this to anyone.",1385424000,3,237,4.108695652173913
5856554,5,B00DUGC29S,"Once you get the steps down, it's a great workout! I wasn't sure what to expect, but every session makes me sweat and I don't even realize I'm working out because it's fun!",1384992000,,172,4.242424242424242
8597886,1,B00DUGC29S,Too advanced and fast for a beginner:(,1516060800,,38,4.571428571428571
8597887,4,B00DUGC29S,"The merengue and cha cha warm up get you started.  Paso doble features authentic flamenco moves.  The salsa section was the best and gives an intense aerobic work out.  Kym shines as a knowledgeable, encouraging, and authentic instructor. Paul, the ""Bailando Por Un Sueo"" international champion, is a background dancer.",1467504000,,319,5.34
8597888,5,B00DUGC29S,Very fun,1465948800,,8,3.5
8597889,2,B00DUGC29S,"No high marks here for this.  They hardly take the time to teach you the steps before they are off and flying, which makes it very frustrating.  Just to get used to doing the combination steps for the salsa (just the first four, mind you, as I am don't have the ""muscle memory"" for these steps), I had to rewind  and rewind and rewind and rewind...insert infinity symbol here.  This makes it quite frustrating.  Then to add insult to injury, they are TOO good at what they do, with expert hip swishes that turns a normally non-hater person into a hater quickly.

Really, if you want to do this and you don't already know how to do the dances, it will take a long time with lots of frustration, especially if you are a normal person.  This is not beginners level, and I didn't get much aerobic exercise while trying to learn the steps. All I got was a very irritated hip from doing so many side-steps from incessant rewinds, and trying to blend the steps together without good cues.",1457136000,2,981,4.416666666666667
8597890,5,B00DUGC29S,lots of fun,1456617600,,11,3.0
8597891,5,B00DUGC29S,Just started it and steps are easy to follow. I broke out a sweat in the first 20 mins. Works,1456185600,,93,3.7
8597892,2,B00DUGC29S,Not for beginners.,1453248000,,18,5.333333333333333
8597893,3,B00DUGC29S,Ummmm this was disappointing,1437091200,,28,6.25
8597894,3,B00DUGC29S,"On the whole, I'm pretty happy with this one; it's basically what I had in mind. The warm-up is a good (and effective) intro to the vibe of the other workouts. For me, there was inevitably a certain amount of free-styling at various points where the steps were just too fast/complex for my skill set, but it usually didn't come until towards the end of a given workout, when the combinations were at their most difficult. Karina was certainly cheerful, and she's obviously an excellent dancer,  but I preferred Kim's teaching style.  She was better at building in small ""walk it out"" moments in between combinations so you never really felt lost while still maintaining momentum. The paso was fun, as was the salsa, though the latter was team taught by both Karina and Kim, so at times it was awkward switching back and forth between their teaching styles. The samba was, frankly, kind of a bust for me - difficult and probably better for someone with more experience and in better shape than I am at this point. I didn't love the cool down track - mostly various yoga poses, and I would've preferred some more traditional stretching rather than contortionist pretzeling. But, overall, I'd say worth the $8 I paid.",1428624000,2,1214,4.721698113207547
