4622840,5,B0059XTU3G,"Just got back from a sneak preview and I was blown away with this movie.

Continuing the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, this movie ramps up the adventure and effects, while avoiding the first movie's tendency to draaaaaaaaaagg in parts.  This time, the story picks up with action, and then follows it with more and more action.  There are welcome interjections of humor (not the extended dwarf eating jokes of the first movie) and even unexpected romance (an original creation of the director and his writing partner, involving a character not in the book).

The acting was very good as well, with Martin Freeman clearly more comfortable in the leading role this time out.  Surprising me was  Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, the elven guard.  Quite the departure from anything I've seen her do, and she is very good.

The crown jewel of this movie is the encounter with the dragon, Smaug.  Hardly a surprise, given the title, but Smaug is the first dragon who is at once majestic, sinister, and cunning.  And seemingly powerful enough that there shouldn't be much hope of standing against him.  And the fire breathing is spectacular.

Clocking in at just under 2 hours and 45 minutes, this is a nice, long, rollicking adventure that was utterly worth paying to see in a theater, and absolutely benefits from the 3D effects.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1386633600,18,1339,4.871681415929204
4622890,1,B0059XTU3G,"If you are a fan of the original book The Hobbit, you will probably find this movie disappointing. Its not at all true to the original book. There are characters, events, and entire plot lines that do not exist in the book. Also, the original book would translate well into a movie with some action. But its not meant to be an action movie. This movie is obviously another tired example of the new genre of movies whos real purpose is to sell the video games to be released under the same name. If you want to see a movie thst takes the classic book and turns it into an action film where every character is a martial arts swordmaster like in a video game, changes the plot, and adds characters, then this is your movie.",1526688000,,720,4.301470588235294

4623047,5,B0059XTU3G,"Smaug's voice sounds almost exactly like that of the cowboy actor, Richard Boone, who did the voice in the Rankin-Bass animated version of The Hobbit for TV in 1977. (Boone was dying in a hospital when his lines were recorded!) This is a nice tip-of-the-hat to the Rankin-Bass production.

It is also inescapable (pleasantly) that the production here (and also in The Lord of the Rings) pays recognition to the Harry Potter films, from the construction of settings to the amazing use of CGI. (Look at Smaug's physiology, the bat-like front limbs. for example.)

What I like about both series, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, is that here and there a familiar face or voice from Harry Potter (or even Masterpiece Theater of the BBC) will be seen or heard! One gets the impression that this is an ensemble group connected to the BBC. (See the TV series ""An Age of Kings"" from the 1960s; see how many actors who appeared in ""James Bond"" movies you can spot -- and watch for the sword fights and notice who is in them.)

There have been some liberties taken with the plot line, but most of the main points have gotten through. Some lines of dialog have been excised; if you want to hear them, see the Rankin-Bass production, notably in the death scene of Thorin Oakenshield.

Otherwise, the movies do yeoman service to the original stories. Enjoy!",1518480000,,1349,4.631799163179917

4623109,4,B0059XTU3G,"I put this on my Wish list and got it for Christmas. I held off buying it for a long time.

There are few things that enrage me more than gratuitous heterosexuality added to a movie version of a story which have nothing to do with the original plot. Its especially bad when it takes moments away from the title character of the book I was looking forward to.
I accept that this is a more grim version of The Hobbit, a prelude to Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings movie. Much of the lightheartedness in the novel was lost as a result. Im a little sad about that, but I can accept it.

I cannot accept a heterosexual relationship being thrown into the story which takes away from the story. It comes off as a bad contrivance, marring what joy I might have seen in witnessing a strong, female elf fighting alongside the other wood elves that are there. I don't mind her presence, but does she have to be paired off with one of the dwarves?

Fortunately, the acting in this movie, the sets, and the music were all first rate. It countered some of my disappointment in the changes, along with my sadness at Bilbo losing part of his journey.

Nor did I dislike all of the changes. The meeting of Thorin in Bree with Gandalf, the confrontation at Dol Guldur, and the lead up to the Arkenstone I enjoyed. The increased development of Bard, the Master, and Laketown itself were all quite interesting.

Some of the action scenes felt a bit forced and made me roll my eyes. They were spectacular, though.

Above all, this movie was beautiful, something I always appreciate in a film. The sets and settings took my breath away. The acting was every bit equal to the environments they took place in. The music matched both of these.

The extras which came with the DVD were a welcome bit of backstory which made me enjoy the whole more.

Balancing the strengths vs. the awkward contrivances, I give this film four stars. It might have gotten five, if there had been less contrivances.",1516320000,,1970,4.4527777777777775

4623126,5,B0059XTU3G,"While it may be impossible to fairly judge a single installment before experiencing the entire series, Peter Jacksons fifth installment to J.R.R. Tolkiens beloved books has the intensity and thrills of that made the initial trilogy (2001-2003) so beloved. The Desolation of Smaug poses the dilemma of responsibility  what are the motions set into actions by these dwarves? Or a nomad wizard? Or a sneaky Halfling? Manhood is buried at the center of Jacksons franchise, so while An Unexpected Adventure (2012) prompts us off our couches and away from self-assured complacent, it was able to function as more care-free and childish; as any concerns of continued mediocre quality are substantially lessen in this sequel. By way of a giant ape (King Kong), the creature Gollum (The Two Towers), or a child rapist (The Lovely Bones)  Jackson creates a world of simultaneous fear and excitement, and so the illusive dragon easily steals the show and leaves audiences begging for more.",1514419200,,978,5.144654088050315

They took serious liberties editing out great parts, as well as adding in things that were not in the story line ever. I was irritated after the first hobbit movie, but tried going in from there on thinking of them as some new random fantasy movie instead of a butcher job of a classic story I grew up loving.

The Hobbit Trilogy is the best Trilogy I have seen since the original Star Wars.

Martin Freeman is amazing as Bilb and Richard Armitage does a great job as  Thorin.  Sir Ian Kellen is really good as Gandalf.

But I have a special place in my heart for all the Dwarves and Balboa scenes.

The spiders were as creepy as can be.  And who doesn't think that Thronduil want perfect?

Legolas and Turkey were perfect additions.

But Smaug was the jewel in the crown.  The effects used to give Smaug life and personality, especially Benedict Cumberbatch's voice, give Smaug legendary proportions.

Best dragon ever.

I am not a fan, at all of fantasy fiction.  But the Hobbit movies are amazing.

The opening section with Beorn does have a real idea about it and was only so brief because Tolkien devoted little time to this character. Laketown wasn't what I expected. It was so  Dickensian. I didn't dislike it, but it was surprising and sort of odd. The main punch of the movie starts when they leave for the Mountain, and these areas were great until the furnace sequence. I wasn't quite sure what Thorin was thinking, since a dragon's hide is so tough not even hot molten gold could kill him. (Not that most people have a hundred thousand tons of random gold to experiment with.) Smaug looked surprisingly good as a blonde, pity he shook all that gold off! But this sequence was still silly and weird and then the movie ended very abruptly. Still, I watch it often.",1493424000,,857,4.529032258064516

Like ""tossing dwarves"" in LOTR, the Hobbit has jokes and childish versions of language which should have soared. A great example is the repeated use of ""smoking weed"" for comic relief. Hobbits did not get high. Too childish, too much CGI... I'm still waiting for a good version of Tolkien to be made.

The character I'm thinking of was happy and very lively in The Lord of the Rings but not so in this film.  Someone might say they were living in dark times and it would follow he should be glum, but they were living in dark times once again in the previous films, and yet there he was youthful and happy.

I have never read the books but watched because I was looking forward to a beautiful movie with an amazing actor (freeman). Instead it was like the director was saying I want a movies worth of money but i have no plot to fill it with so here's just a bunch of characters walking around for 5 hours. by the end of it i was still waiting for the story to start. what a waste of Martin Freeman. CGI at some points was video game quality. here is a synopsis so you need not feel hoodwinked either: hobbit and his dwarf friends go into forest at bidding of Dumbledore, who was called off to i assume the ministry for no reason. immediately get set upon by acromantulas. they escape with hobbits help. but are immediately set upon by elves, but they escape with hobbits help, they go on a white water rafting adventure but are immediately set upon by orcs, they escape with elves help? because one of the she elves has fallen for wee dwarf. they are then saved by Zorro and taken to a city where Stephen fry is mayor. which for me was the highlight. Dumbledore meanwhile is searching for one can only assume grindelwald in Nurmengard. he sees that everyone has broken out and is worried. he is then of all things placed in a bird cage by grindelwald who is looking shiftily like an eyeball. back to the hobbit where the dwarves have Aladdin style left him to go into a cave filled with gold alone to steal something for them. he finds the dragon. wakes the dragon. the dragons voice is sexy so they allow him to keep talking for rest of movie. the dwarves find their courage, fight the dragon, zero people die, zero dragons die, but the one lesson we learn is dragon fire cannot melt gold coins but dwarf kilns melt a whole lot of solid gold in .5 seconds. so there's that. dragon flys off to one can only assume not kill a whole lot more people in the next movie.",1487116800,,1986,4.298666666666667

The BAD: CGI is laughable, so much so that it looks like cartoon animation. The elves jump around without any Physics, the horses trot like they are not touching the ground, and so on.
The characters just go from place to place with no palpable change in atmosphere. The acting is wooden and predictable.

It is a beloved book which has quite a lot of light hearted details.  These movies are non-stop darkness and dread.  They completely change the tone and style of the characters and the story.

4623726,5,B0059XTU3G,"Just like with An Unexpected Journey, the Desolation of Smaug is a very well made adaptation of the book 'The Hobbit' that will satisfy every fantasy fan looking for a beautifully made fantastic movie.

But, also just like with An Unexpected Journey, a lot of assumptions have been made, and elements have been added to the story-line that are there purely for adding time to the movie and making sure 'The Hobbit' trilogy has enough material to span 3 long movies again.
In 'An Unexpected Journey' this has been done especially to bring back (or rather, introduce) characters from the Lord of the Rings trilogy and make sure 'The Hobbit' creates the right foundation for the storyline to come. In 'The Desaulation of Smaug' characters have been added and situations have been thought up that could, and maybe, should have been left out. I love Evangeline Lilly as an actress, and here again she does a wonderful job, but being very familiar with the story - this part felt a bit unnecessary.

But, as you might have noticed, without hesitation I give this movie 5 stars. It is still a darn good movie. And the acting is so well done again. I have to also highlight the role of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins; he acts the whole trilogy with such devotion, the awkwardness and humility that you really root for the guy.

This is the part of the trilogy that has something for every fantasy fan: Dwarves, Elves, monsters, spiders, magic, evil and a very talkative dragon. What is there not to love?",1485216000,,1497,4.662878787878788

Also, while it's cool that Benedict Cumberbatch lent his voice to the movie, they run it through so many filters that it's practically impossible to recognize him if you didn't already know it was him.

4623953,2,B0059XTU3G,"Take every plot element from the LOTR films, mix them up at random, make the storyline less comprehensible, and  voil  you have The Hobbit.

The Desolation of Smaug is the second of three Hobbit flicks, in which the brave hobbit Bilbo of the Shire and a group of dwarves attempt to steal back a priceless jewel from the sleeping dragon Smaug. While the little people are busy chasing their trinkets, the wizard Gandalf the Grey discovers the true identity of the Necromancer. It's really Sauron, who for the nth time is back to destroy the world for no better purpose than his own darker amusement. There are a lot of orchs and trolls in the story, too, so many in fact, that they become positively annoying after one hour and a half!

Not really interesting, unless you are a really hardcore LOTR fan (LOTR as in the Lord of the Rings movies, not the novels). Still, I suppose it's quite cool to do your own fan fiction, which is what Peter Jackson has been up to here. Some would say for six films in a row",1480118400,,1008,4.403225806451613

4624312,5,B0059XTU3G,"part of one of my favorite series. Is it exactly like the books? No, then again, few movies ever are. The great uproar over Tauriel (the she-elf played by Evangeline Lilly) is understandable, but I think she was added not just for a more feminine presence beyond Cate Blanchett, but partially because Liv Tyler's Arwen's and Miranda  Otto's Eowyn's fighting scenes were reduced or cut in LOTR. That's my theory at least. It does make one wonder about the Legolas aspect in both sets - he never mentions to Gimli that he knew his father?

4624452,3,B0059XTU3G,"I was a little disappointed by the first Hobbit installment in the 3-part trilogy. Too much of the beginning was used to reintroduce us to residents of The Shire. Yes, it grew on me after repeat viewings. But it could have been better. I was even afraid Peter Jackson was starting to lose his touch.

Fast forward to opening day of Desolation of Smaug, and all of my fears have been laid to rest. I caught this flick at the earliest time slot that the theater chain near my crib offered, which was in the A.M. The theater was about 1/3 full of other dorks who probably lied to their bosses and took a sick day just to catch this movie. No, there was nobody camping out in tents, TFG.

Smaug gets an incredible amount of screen time and makes this sequel awesome. The creature effects were sorta cartoony, but balanced by Benedict Cumberbatch's incredible voice work. I'm not sure how exciting the 3rd will be as it may just end up being a battle movie like Return of the King. All-in-all, I left the theater knowing that my movie ticket was a good investment.",1469577600,,1059,4.425641025641026

Stupid insane over the top battle scenes every 7 minutes or so and everything is so visceral.  yes, that's the word, visceral.  There's not enough subtlety and sublimeness like there is in the books.  Too much ""in your face"" stuff like today's modern age of degenerative society.  I rolled my eyes and quit watching when I saw Legolas and then a female elf ( Go grrrrrrl !  Grrrrrl  Power !!) basically surfing across tree limbs and the forest floor as they effortlessly shot dead every spider in sight with arrows or slashed them casually with their deft swords.  Puh - Lease.  It's just so sophomoric and juvenile.  jackson almost ruined these movies.  I say almost because I like the casting, the (non CGI ) scenery and it was mildly entertaining.  But it's just so eye-rollingly ridiculous to any adult who doesn't enjoy bumper to bumper CGI arcade game graphics and battles.  I'm not sure if I was watching Fast and Furious 8.3 redeaux or the Hobbit.  Okay, that last statement was sarcasm to the max, but I think you get the picture.

4624910,3,B0059XTU3G,"The second movie in the Hobbit series is quite a bit darker than the first one (which was very much darker than the book that Tolkien wrote).  For me, it was a rough go watching it.

The movie begins with the group running from orcs and continues to follow them through Mirkwood and ends soon after Bilbo and the dwarves reach the Lonely Mountain.  Along the way there is fairly non-stop mayhem, with a fair chunk of Azog's army being decapitated, speared through, or simply shot through in unusual ways.  As usual, Peter Jackson's vision of locations in Middle Earth is pretty amazing and in places breath taking.

Unfortunately, very little actually happens in this movie.  We are introduced to a few new characters - Beorn, Bard, Smaug, and Tauriel.  A romance is kindled between a dwarf (Fili) and an Elf (Tauriel) which seems amazingly far fetched.  As for plot otherwise, it is pretty thin -- mostly about how the company gets from here to there, while pursued by orcs.

I am disappointed in a few different things.  First of all, I am very tired of the extended, video-game like montages of dwarves/elves killing orcs.  The only reason to fear orcs, is that there are as many of them as Legolas has arrows.  Other than Azog, they seem amazingly easy to kill and are really weak as antagonists.  More than anything though, I would really like to have more plot and less action.  It is hard to get to know characters when all they are doing is running from or killing orcs.  Even the extended interaction with Smaug eventually feels silly.  Many of the action sequences are very video-game like and do nothing for me.

The second thing that disappoints, is the high level of darkness that has crept into the franchise.  I suppose that this sequel is to serve a sort ""Empire Strikes Back"" purpose before the launch of the final film, but the constant dark feeling -- basically without relenting -- is upsetting.  Understanding Peter Jackson's desire to flesh out the back story, the addition of the battle between Gandalf and Sauron only serves to deepen the black mood which seems to underpin this movie.  This movie has a darkness which is greater than anything I remember from the LOTR trilogy.

There is an amazing amount of time compression that goes on here.  While I understand that this is to give urgency to the actions of the characters, it also makes it feel as though most of their actions are completely unplanned and random.  For example, the dwarves are captured and almost immediately Bolg plans an attack on the halls of the wood elves and Bilbo rescues the dwarves.  The dwarves arrive in Esgaroth and have to be at the Mountain within two days.

A final thing is that there is little done with character development.  That is to say, most characters are fleshed out primarily with regard to their style with which they kill orcs.  It is sad, but other than size and appearance, I have a hard time telling any of the dwarves from each other (except for Thorin and Balin).

There were a few things I really liked about the movie.  Bard seemed to be an interesting character, with excellent acting by Luke Evans.  He is one of the places where you actually feel like you do get to see a real person -- probably because he doesn't have to waste his time killing orcs and can spend time interacting with his kids and the dwarves.  Smaug is the other excellent creation.  He really does come alive in a real way and he is a far more worthwhile villain than Azog.

In the end, there never was enough material in the Hobbit for three movies.  Maybe Peter Jackson just loves this world so much that he decided to make The Hobbit into three movies, but one has to think that money played a part as well.  I still think the main themes of the book The Hobbit is missing here -- that small people can do great things, if they have a little luck and a lot of courage and that the most important things in life are not found in wealth, but in things that money can't buy.

Be that as it may, two hours of action set pieces and forty minutes of acting doesn't make for an interesting movie.  I may watch it again, because I love Middle Earth, but I can't say that I was very impressed by it.",1460160000,7,4199,4.499339498018494

4625010,2,B0059XTU3G,"The Desolation of Smaug hardly qualifies as a real movie.  It has no beginning, no ending, no character arcs or significant plot twists....  it was just a bunch of stuff that happened (to invoke Homer Simpson).  Now, none of The Hobbit movies are all that good, especially compared to Lord of the Rings, but this one was a whole lot of nothing.  I guess this was to be expected since Warner Bros. got greedy and forced Peter Jackson and company to milk a trilogy out a single book.  Let's compare Desolation to The Two Towers.  Both are the middle films in trilogies, but consider that The Two Towers has its incredible opening, the expansion of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog, and it's spine tingling ending with the victory at Helm's Deep, along with the introduction and thorough development of the first truly successful CGI character in Gollum, and it just further shows how much Desolation fails to be its own distinct film.  Okay, so this is the Extended Edition, which I purchased mostly to hear the director's commentary.  I really couldn't pinpoint the extra scenes because a) there aren't that many, and b) I only saw Desolation once before, in the theaters, and it left little to no memorable impression on me.  Jackson and Phillipa Boyens spend their commentary discussing all the extraneous plot and characters they shoved in to flesh out a third movie.  There are a bunch of extras and documentaries like the other LOTR/Hobbit EE DVD/BR sets, but I don't think I ever watched any of them because I really didn't care about this film like I did with the LOTR EEs.  I actually liked An Unexpected Journey and thought The Battle of the Five Armies wasn't too bad, but Desolation just made me mad at Warner Bros. for stretching The Hobbit so unnecessarily thin for its cinematic depiction.  The only reason I'd recommend it is for the commentary, but most of the information contained in it is on the IMDB trivia page for the movie, so I just saved you $25.",1457913600,,1970,4.678260869565217

That said, the LotR  trilogy could be, and was, easily made into three movies...The Hobbit shouldn't have been. The book can be read in a very short time. I have been reading all four books since I was a child, and I still read them on a regular basis. I honestly never get tired of reading those stories. Making The Hobbit into a trilogy was not the best idea because it  should have been one movie...there was plenty  of content in the book to make it an excellent single movie.  Also, I don't understand why The Hobbit was the last to come out...it should have been the first.  After all, it was the beginning for the Trilogy. Of course, the Lord of the Rings  immediately got everyone's attention.

The characters and the atmosphere were an important part of the first movie that I just didn't get this time around. The extended edition fixes all of that. Its ""extra"" scenes are actually necessary for telling the story properly, and I wouldn't want to ever watch the movie without them. Once again, this film like the last is a fun and action packed adventure with likeable characters and beautiful visuals, (though in this one there are a few shots that look very CG, it mostly looks pretty realistic in HD). HD is the best way to view the hobbit. Not a perfect movie. The ending drags on a little bit with a rather dull action scene, but aside from that (and one rather awkward subplot) I well enjoy watching this movie. :D",1454025600,,886,4.509316770186335

This just shows that girls always need love and a man to do things, which absolutely isn't true (in my opinion). And also, why bring back Legolas?

4625380,4,B0059XTU3G,"I have seen both the theatrical version and extended.  I would advise buyers to just get the extended it fills in a lot of holes in the story and makes it a better movie.

Out of the 3 Hobbit films by Peter Jackson.  I actually enjoy this one the most.  The only thing that keeps it out of the 5 star territory is the ridiculous barrel scene.  I just thought it went on for to long and seemed silly.  None of the hero characters ever seemed to be in any real danger.  The fat Hobbit barrel attack on land was just stupid.  I suppose they kept that scene in for the kids and weak minded ADD people in need of action and no realism.

The skin changer character Beorn was interesting and pretty cool.  It would have been neat to see him attack some of the orcs as the bear.  Also the Mirkwood spider scenes are great probably my favorite part of the whole film.  As with the previous film Unexpected Journey I seemed to care more about Gandolf's search for the Necromancer at Gol Guldur, than I did about the Dwarves making it to the Lonely Mountain.  Seeing him find the empty tombs was very cool.  The love story between Tauriel and Kili is pretty good.  They do seem to have some weird kind of chemistry.  I was surprised that when the dwarves coat the Dragon with gold that he did not stay coated in the gold like I remember in the Hobbit book.  But that element aside I really enjoy watching the movie.  The dragon does come off as smart and terrifying.

It is funny how Gandolf the great and all powerful wizard is always running away from everything.  The ending is such a big teaser for the next film.  I was thinking aw man I have to now wait a year to see what happens.  I originally saw this film in the theater on opening weekend.  Overall I would give this 4 stars its not great but it is a nice popcorn movie.",1450396800,,1820,4.196531791907514

4625395,4,B0059XTU3G,"Overall, well done. The only two sticking points for me were the orcs & Legolas. Apparently, unless you're the orc leader, you're as useless as a Storm Trooper. Same thing with the goblins in the first movie; completely unable to fight & dying in droves if the main characters look at you funny. Meanwhile, Legolas (who looks older despite this being a prequel) & his female elf companion can kill a dozen bad guys in half of a second while doing a flying somersault. I know elves are supposed to have high dexterity, but at least make the fight scenes realistic :(

On the other hand, Smaug was very well done, and the storyline stayed interesting even with the additional content used to extend the movies. Don't pay more than ten bucks for this movie, but if you see it for five, definitely pick it up.",1450224000,,805,4.513698630136986

The Trilogy movies were great, and so I was looking forward to ""The Hobbit"" but all three of ""The Hobbit"" movies really suck! They are  way too predictable with totally ridiculous with overdone special effects that are not believable in any way even considering that fantasy/ science/ fiction/ action adventure movies are not meant to be all that realistic which is ok. I thoroughly enjoyed the Lord Of The Rings trilogy but the three Hobbit movies are just too ridiculous for me. There is one scene where the Hobbits are riding in the barrels and the barrels are open. They're bobbing up and down and rolling around and yet no water gets into the barrels making it just too unbelievable. They should have all sunk and drowned!",1448150400,,785,4.64748201438849

4625595,2,B0059XTU3G,"I am going to start off with what worked with this film, its not much. The little fight between the spiders and the dwarfs and the confrontation between Smaug and Bilbo. Those two scenes are the only thing worth watching in this movie. What is supposed to be a story about Bilbo and some dwarfs taking back a mountain is quickly forgotten. The film shifts to Legolas and his new friend, this deviates from really getting to know the dwarfs more. By the end of the movie the only people I cared about was Bilbo. I did not know enough about the dwarfs and how they felt to care. The love story they wrote in, did not feel believable. The barrel battle scene felt like a video game, while the scene with the dwarfs trying to kill Smaug felt like a forced ending, also felt very much like the end of Alien 3. The film is hurt by the over use of CGI, nothing seems real or alive. The film had no heart, it was all spectacle. It is clear now that taking the Hobbit and making three films hurt the flow of the series. The extended edition does add a few scenes that I found good, mostly with Gandalf, the film was still hurt by being over long. In short Peter Jackson sold out for the gold. What a waste of Ian Mckellen, Christopher lee and Martin Freeman.",1446422400,,1249,4.2301255230125525

4625649,1,B0059XTU3G,"When the Hobbit movies were released to theaters, I half-boycotted them, just because I found it offensive that Peter Jackson and the corporation he had made a billion dollars for with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy had decided to ""expand"" the Hobbit into a trilogy of its own. Seriously? ""The Hobbit""? That slender little novel? On its own, it would have made a fine single prequel film, but a trilogy was obviously an act of corporate greed. Besides, it probably meant that it wouldn't be very good, either.

But, oh, I was so unprepared for just how preposterously bad it would be in the end.

When the first film came out on DVD, I tried watching it, and it was too leaden and dull to finish... and something seemed a little bit off with the half of the film I made it through. Years later, I came across the second and third films together on a library shelf, and thought, oh what the heck? I took them home and made a go of it. The second film was disappointingly bad -- the bare skeleton of the original story lay there, somewhere under the CGI-swaddled fictions of the bloated new script. New characters appeared, old characters became distorted and unrecognizable, the film was overrun with scenes and scenarios that didn't exist in Tolkien's world, and the dialog was atrocious. It soon became clear that the corporate cash-in was far worse than even the most nervous Middle Earth fan could have ever imagined.

Did you think Legolas was a cool badass in the LOTR triology? Wanted to see more of him in action? Well, in H2, you get so much of him zapping orcs with arrows, you start to get sick of it. The big river barrel battle scene is just a video game sequence writ large, soon to be transferred directly to PlayStation, or whatever. No alterations necessary. It was already that bad and that devoid of any tangible emotional core. The scenes of Smaug the dragon are cool, but like everything else, they drag on too long and even the most devoted viewer will be bored by the spectacle onscreen.

H3 is worse. Way worse. There is nothing recognizable from the original book at all in this film. This isn't a mere distortion or padding-out of Tolkien's work, it is a pure desecration and an absolute obscenity. The simplicity of ""The Hobbit"" isn't merely lost, it is spat upon and mocked as unsalable and naive. This is a loud crude, poorly written, painfully melodramatic mess in which the dwarvish party that Bilbo joined is torn apart and decimated, not by the greed of Thorin Oakenshield (as they would have you believe) but by the avarice of Peter Jackson.

In a near-cosmic irony, all the pompous speechifying in the film -- about lost honor, broken promises and the corrosive power of greed -- is reflected back with venomous fury upon the makers of this film, those weak, heartless fools who were seduced by the hundreds of millions of dollars they could make into utterly destroying the artistic vision of J. R. R. Tolkien, sacrificing his creations on an altar of pure greed. Blinded, they made themselves believe that the ""epic"" battles they computer-generated into existence had meaning and emotional heft, and that the damage they had done by offering this travesty to the world as an ""interpretation"" of Tolkien's work was worth it because, really, they were telling the story so much better than he ever could have. Surely, if Tolkien could have made a film where Legolas shoots arrows at orcs while standing on the on the heads of two dwarves while they were stuck in barrels rushing down a river, he would have. Surely, if Tolkien had computer animation at his command, he would have envisioned Legolas running in slow motion up a pile of crumbling bricks as the bridge he stood on fell into the abyss, defying gravity ala Wiley Coyote. Surely, if Tolkien could have made all these marvels appear onscreen, he would have written dialog as badly as the writers of this film: why bother with art, when you can have more money and riches than even Smaug himself could imagine?

These movies are so bad -- indeed so warped and evil -- I would argue that Peter Jackson should promise to never make another film again. As penance, all of the good movies he made when he was still human should also be burned, destroyed, buried in hidden caves in the mountains of New Zealand, or thrown into Mount Doom itself, if only we could find one person in all the world pure enough of heart to carry the burden. But, alas, I myself was seduced into watching them, and have been befouled, like so many others. It may be many, bleak, countless years before we can find the champion who will rid the world of these dark tales. It will be a long, dark, saddened era, but one day, the stench will be lifted. But I beseech you, all of you who have not seen these blasphemous abominations: do not listen to the whispers and lies. They are evil. Peter Jackson has lost his soul, and may never regain his honor. We will weep for the man that once was. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1445817600,9,4994,4.5867861142217246

He knew one movie wasn't going to make a billion dollars, so he made three.  When I first heard The Hobbit would be made into two movies, I got a little worried.

I like how the Director/Producer decided to go with three movies each, so that the appropriate amount of detail could be kept.

This one in particular was good. They did SUCH a good job on Smaug. He was big, smart, mean, vindictive, and a little arrogant too. They should have had him toast more dwarves though.

The first movie (An Unexpected Journey) was pretty slow. Way too much character development, and dwarves spilling beer all down their beards. I doubt anyone wasted it that way. The last one (The Battle of the Five Armies) was just one big battle.",1445126400,,774,4.443661971830986

You begin to be able to tell the dwarves apart and know who is who, which is good. Keep an eye on Thorin's nephews, the dwarf brothers Fili and Kili as they emerge from the pack into far more complex and interesting characters than the book lead us to believe. King Thranduil of Mirkwood, btw is incredible. Totally Incredible.

May i remind the public that the actual Hobbit book was only a thin, one volume story.  Lord of the Rings actually WAS supposed to be three books so it makes sense that it was three movies, but making the Hobbit into this huge long saga?  In my view, this is absolutely Ridiculous.  This film was entitled ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"";  Smaug wasn't even desolated in it; the title made me think he's going to be killed in this one; and I don't take kindly to being tricked, even slightly in this way.  I don't think I'd give this strongly of a negative review if I wasn't overwhelmed and befuddled at the amount of positive reviews I just read.  It lacked substance and good material;  I'm disappointed with Peter Jackson. But I will continue to be honest, and conclude that i enjoyed the celebratory note of bringing aspects from the Lord of the Rings: similar lines in the script, same melody of music, etc...  It made these Tolkien movies flow.",1441756800,2,1085,4.467005076142132

But here is a dislaimer, for those that want to watch the movie in the hopes that it's like the original book, it's not. That doesn't mean it's bad, but like the walking dead and it's paralell universe (the one in the original comics and the one onscreen) this movie is different. This movie brings in some character's and events that further tie the Hobbit to the first trilogy, and appeals to those viewers that watched the fisrt trilogy but didn't read the books. Lover's of the Lord of the Rings trilogies will see some familiar faces and places while also meeting some very intresting new ones. I thought this movie was full of heart, story, adventure and it had more action than the first.

The movie felt like a deliberate delay to get the end of the book, creating characters and situations that weren't in the book.  The dwarves run from Smaug for the last 1/2 hour of the movie, only to have Smaug angrily leave the mountain and Bilbo utter the clique line, ""What have we done?""  The CGI scenes are incredibly fake and overdone and the acting is childish.  Overall, it's pathetic and a waste of money.",1440201600,3,466,4.447058823529412

If you're a book snob with regard to the Hobbit (I am) or loved the 1970s cartoon version (I did), this movie will underwhelm. Admittedly, it's the best of the trilogy, but not only is the film cluttered by inessential elements that bring the plot to a halt, but the final sequence is so profoundly ridiculous that any hope of immersion and/or escapism is lost. In essence, the film tries to straddle lines constantly . . . does it want to be loyal to the book or to modern audiences, does it want to be dramatic or slapstick, etc.

And a constant complain about the trilogy, by the way, is too much CGI - especially on the orcs/goblins. At times, I felt like I was watching a videogame cinematic.",1438214400,,803,4.389261744966443

 However, this is a product review. And people please listen to me when I tell you that this is not the extended version. If you read in the Title it will say Limited Edition. This is because of the two AMAZING bookends of the dwarves guarding erebor and extra behind the scene DVDS. Yes this product has blu ray version of both normal format and 3D.

It's also one that you enjoy watching over again, just for the sheer enormity of what's on the screen. Having read the series from the ""Silmarialan"" the the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and obviously enjoyed them immensely. Peter Jackson did a wonderful job bringing as much of the books to the screen as possible and in oversight, can't imagine anyone doing it ""better."" If you don't have it in your collection you should. It's that much fun.

As for the movie, it's fantastic for any fan of the LotR movies or the Hobbit or Tolkien in general. Expect it to be a bit disjointed due to being the middle of the trilogy. Some scenes are taken from the first movie, but at least it doesn't feel too slow. There is enough action and power in it to keep you entertained.

4626298,5,B0059XTU3G,Great addition to an already amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy. Though it doesn't follow the book as closely as I had hoped it does improve upon an almost perfectly written story. The addition of Tauriel (who is a very Tolkien like character) to the story was a very well thought out addition and gave a much needed perspective that no one else could give. The acting and the costumes are both amazing. The dragon was believable and perfectly cast. My only complaint about the movie is that is wasn't long enough. :),1435795200,,516,4.559139784946237

All the whizz bang features where good, considering we live in a world who wants action and not a story.  The main reason for 4 stars is just that.  I have seen them all and they could have done a much better job, since having read the books several times. I did like the fact they included some characters they left out from LOTR's movies.  They missed the mark a few times but over all it was worth watching while I prefer the books to the movie much more detailed. I liked the movies as well.

Like Harry potter by the third movie the only reason you knew it was Harry Potter was they mentioned his name.  the books where so much better, though I will mention that J.K. Rowlings did mess up on one thing a basalisk is not a snake, course this is from to many hours spent playing Dungeons and Dragons.  But that is a whole other review in itself.

Over all I give the movie four stars I can't quite justify five for this movie or any of them. the visuals where great the storyline was good, but they could have followed the book a bit better.",1435190400,,1164,4.119469026548672

4626435,4,B0059XTU3G,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
 Millions of viewers have chosen to immerse themselves in the second of the Hobbit trilogy-The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.  The two hours and 41 minute long excursion into middle earth outsold the next 20 films at the box office, combined.  The Hobbit: An Un-expected Journey took in over $1Billion in worldwide receipts.  Hobbit 2 will likely come near to that mark.  It rather renders movie reviews pointless.  Everyone will see this film.
 Peter Jackson directed this edition of his now patented movie property.  He also wrote it along with Guillermo del Toro (Hobbit 1, Pans Labyrinth).  The fabulous attention to detail and the cute side talk of the characters made the Lord of the Rings trilogy for me.  Who can forget the worried Hobbits speculating about elevenzies, a meal known only to hungry hobbits?  We have only a touch, enough to make us miss the rest, in this edition.  Too much of the screen time in Hobbit 2 is taken up by long shots of the Dwarf/Hobbit/Human band of adventurers making their way carefully along cliff faces or striding picturesquely along rugged ridges.  Too little time is spent with the travelers, talking and quipping as they make their way.
 I also found the fighting episodes repetitious rather than exciting.  We do come away with the firm appreciation of the speed and ruthless ferocity of Elves in battle.  We can learn that lesson in two minutes as well as twelve minutes and after the first couple of dozen slain Orcs, more is not better.
 Some of our old friends return.  Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf the Grey.  Olando Bloom comes back in his role as the Elf archer Legolas.  Martin Freeman once again plays the central character, the reluctant Hobbit hero Bilbo Baggins.
 New comer Evangeline Lilly studied swordsmanship to prepare her for the non-Tolkin addition to the cast of players, the Elf warrior lass Tauriel.  The beautiful Lilly shows her sword training well in slaying oodles of Orcs.  She also delivers what may be the only timeless line in the film-When did we allow evil to become stronger than us?
 Watch for Peter Jackson eating a carrot in the bar scene at the beginning of the film.  Smaug the dragon is great.  The Orcs get scarier in each film.
 Risking futility, I assess this edition of the Tolkin film library at a competent but less than magical three saw blades.  Peter Jackson cannot make a poor film but some of his work reaches the very highest levels.  Not this one.  Estimates of the budget hover around $200 million.  Hobbit hungry fans will return the investment many times over.  I watched it gladly and so will you.",1434326400,,2641,4.76158940397351

4626470,5,B0059XTU3G,"As has been the case with the other extended editions, this is really for die hard fans of the story and/or those who love bonus material.  If you do not fall into either of those categories then you probably want to stick with the theatrical edition because this will be way more than what you are looking for.

Most people who are considering this know the movie well enough that I am not going to spend a lot of time reviewing it.  The extended edition itself comes in just over 3 hrs in length if you count the credits.  It has tacked on about 25 minutes to the theatrical version of the film.  There is generally a lot more action in this movie than the first, and it really just launches into the story.  The only real setup is a flashback showing Gandalf and Thorin meeting at the Prancing Pony in a scene that was taken from the Lord of the Rings Appendices.  As most know this movie started to diverge more from the novel (because of in large part the decision to split the story into three movies), although many elements of the book are in the movie.  The highlight of course, is the full reveal of Smaug and the scene with Bilbo when he is trying to find the stone, which leads into the climax of the movie which is a battle between the dragon and the dwarfs.

The real meat of the extended edition are the two bonus discs (which are titled appendices 9 and 10).  Between the two there are 10 hours of bonus material.  The first disc is really a bunch of behind the scenes and making of features showing the process of filming and creating the movie.  The 10th disc goes more into how they came up with various plot points, the look of the movie etc.  There is a great hour and sixteen minute feature on conceptualizing the look of Smaug and the process Benedict Cumberbatch went through to give his performance.  If you are a fan of bonus material you cannot go wrong with what you get here.

Chances are if you are getting this you know what to expect because you have the other extended editions.  It is much the same as before.  You get a ton of material, and the movie looks as sounds great as you would expect.  Plus the movie is on a single disc unlike the LOTR extended editions, which is a nice plus.  The only downside is with both the movie and the bonus material, if you have to stop (and watching everything straight through is almost impossible) it will not pick up where you left off.  A relatively minor point, but it is easy enough to do that they should have done it.  Otherwise, everything is great and it is definitely worth adding to your collection.",1433894400,,2583,4.328482328482329

The story of the Hobbit as such is told more truly in the Rankin Bass animated version, but Jackson's is a whole saga after all. I loved this movie and series as much as I have the Lord of the Rings.

4626566,1,B0059XTU3G,"The story deviated too much from a truly wonderful tale by Tolkien.  I fully understand ""poetic license"" and appreciated the changes made to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Those changes were necessary to make those stories filmable and bring characters to the screen.  The ridiculous changes made to the Hobbit were an assault to the sensitivity of any Tolkien fan.  No need for a new elf character.  A love interest for the dwarf.  REALLY!!!  Why were any dwarves left behind instead of going to the mountain?  Why the prolonged, agonizing and distorted battle with the dragon.  The original story was superior the what Peter Jackson concocted.  I used to be a Jackson fan.",1432598400,3,675,4.842105263157895

4626673,5,B0059XTU3G,"I am so glad I waited to get the extended version. It had been awhile since I'd rented the movie version so with only a couple of exceptions, I really couldn't tell where the extra footage was added.

I am an avid fan of all the Tolkien books and reread them every few years. I'd read The Hobbit again before the first movie came out and I have to say I liked Peter Jackson's interpretation of the book almost better than the book. I think this is one time that artistic license was welcome.

The only downside to this DVD was that I opted to get the movie with the extra features and I wish I hadn't. I only made it through about an hour of the feature and it was basically about the creation of Smaug which is great because you get to see how they ended up with the final version but it just sort of droned on and on and on. I'll be skipping that from now on. I think it's a one shot thing, you watch it once and you're good.

Otherwise, I recommend this version and I look forward to the Five Armies coming out in an extended version.",1431388800,,1037,4.073529411764706

As a long-time lover of the Hobbit and LOTR books, and of the LOTR movies, I was surprised that I didn't enjoy the Hobbit movies as much, in the theater, as I'd expected.  I chalked it up to too much anticipation and expectation, but realized that the movies were much too action-packed.  They never let you relax and enjoy the movie before the next action scene.  (Out of the frying pan and into the fire only happens once in the book, but that could define the movies.)

4627023,3,B0059XTU3G,"And so we come to the Misty Mountains at long last. long long last. Even longer last. Did I mention long? Overall all 3 Hobbit movies are reasonably good, but suffer from too much of a good thing and would have worked better being edited to two. There are some great pieces in this movie. Plus a good number that will leave Tolkien fans scratching their heads going WTF??? Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings these movies are not. Deeply ruined by the inclusion of tons of extraneous characters that never appeared in the original story. The hot Elf on Dwarf romance was kinda odd. The Dwarbes fighting the dragon was certainly unexpected as well as being rather idiotic and long.

The best part of the Extended edition is it put back in some critical scenes that really should have been left in to begin with. I mean they actually explain why Thranduil is such a jackass. But they cut the needed story and exposition in favor of an extra 10 minutes of idiotic dwarves in barrels like some amusement park ride. Someone really needs to explain to Peter Jackson the difference between using a feather and using the whole damn chicken.

For Tolkien and LotR fans it is pretty much a must see in order to get to the end of it all. And the extended edition is the better cut. But if you haven't seen The Unexpected Journey this will make no sense to you. If you saw the prior movie but also read the book, this will make even less sense to you. Probably just best to forget that it has anything to do with JRR Tolkien and convince yourselves that this is the best Dungeons & Dragons movie ever made.

I know they say ""based on"", but really. And last, the WAY-over-the-top superhuman feats of many of the characters.

4627097,2,B0059XTU3G,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug picks up roughly from where the first Hobbit movie left off. The story continues as Bilbo Baggins and the 13 dwarves continue on their quest to the Lonely Mountain, but this movie was a real game changer for me. Its sort of a bad movie disguised as an okay movie because of the sheer amount of eye candy. However, any wit or charm from the first movie is diminished in the sequels needlessly overbearing plot.

I personally lost confidence in this film the moment I saw Legolas in the trailer, only because he wasn't even created when the book was released. The story would obviously need more plot threads to make his appearance worthwhile. This made me further upset that Peter Jackson still wanted The Hobbit to be the prologue to The Lord of the Rings, instead of a wonderful stand-alone story.

There are three major events from the book that the second Hobbit movie covers. At the start of the story the chief dwarf, Thorin, needs to lead his company through Mirkwood, where they have to face untold dangers as well as the woodland elves. They also make it to Lake Town and then eventually the Lonely Mountain where Smaug makes his big appearance. It is difficult critiquing this installment of the trilogy without spoiling it because this is the content taken from the middle of book. This is also the first movie in the Middle Earth series to end with a cliffhanger. Our connection with the characters in the end doesnt really linger with the viewer quite as much as the urgency to see the third and final installment, so this movie tells a rather insubstantial story.

And even though Ive already said it, The Hobbit movie automatically looses points because its being treated like a prologue rather than the original story. Nowhere in the trilogy is this problem more apparent than in The Desolation of Smaug. In the first movie we remember Bilbo Baggins received the One Ring from Gollum. The original book never portrayed the ring as evil, nor did it foreshadow the connect that it had to the Dark Lord. That was because it never had any relevance to the plot, plus Tolkien never imagined that the ring would be so important before he went on to write The Lord of the Rings.

The Desolation of Smaug is constantly tormenting us with the One Rings corrupting influence on Bilbo Baggins, while never once making mention of how useful the power of invisibility was to him. The One Ring is made so important in this movie that it almost threatens to overshadow Smaug as the real villain. We are given to believe that Sauron is hoping to make a bargain with the dragon, like this simple story about adventure is subtly hinting at war and political tensions. All of that stuff is supposed to be left in The Lord of the Rings where it belongs. The Hobbit is supposed to be a simple story about Bilbos quest to recover Thorins lost birthright without all this foreshadowing being forced onto us.

A lot more Lord of the Rings details that Peter Jackson tried to incorporate into the plot just come across as distracting from the real plot line but this movies greatest sin is making Sauron even less subtle than he was in the Lord of the Rings. His appearance is like an epileptic seizure. Unfortunately, despite all the material that was added to The Hobbit story, its amazing how much unnecessary fighting they needed to add so this movie could have a descent length. Every moment of peril (such as the barrel escape scene) needed to have swords and sorcery added for no good reason. The especially long climatic battle where the dwarfs try to drown the dragon Smaug in a puddle of molten gold was just way too far fetched for the emphasis Peter Jackson normally puts on believability.

It is worth mentioning that Smaugs appearance was, indeed, impressive. The big reveal was definitely worth the wait, as his design and his animation where quite stellar. Even if I thought his appearance could have been less like a frill lizard, its still hard to not appreciate the effort put into him. Benedict Cumberbatch also provides an amazing voice that isn't all growling or bloodthirsty like you normally expect from a dragon.

Unfortunately, getting back to the plot, there are still many details that leave me disgruntled. For example, the secret passage going into the Lonely Mountain was supposed to be revealed by the last light of the day, according to the book AND the Rankin/Bass cartoon AND the map in the movie itself. For no other reason than to mix things up, they decide the light of the moon will instead reveal the secret doorway immediately after all the characters have their moment of disappointment. Thorins character development since the last movie also takes a sudden twist after he has confiding his trust in Bilbo Baggins. During one scene while Smaug is chasing them, Thorin has decided to threaten Bilbo at sword point because of a tiny suspicion. This is ultimately because Thorins been developed as someone who is ambitious to the point of obsession, but no reason has been given for us to like him or for Bilbo to keep following him.

The plot as a whole starts in the middle of one conflict and then ends in the middle of another, indicating no clear reason why The Hobbit had to be divided into a three part epic like it was. I cant even pretend I like it. There is still effort to be appreciated but the story is always either dragging out each conflict the characters are facing or overcomplicating the story with more unnecessary plot. Since there is no ending theres really nothing else to add to the conclusion of this review but thats how I ultimately describe The Desolation of Smaug.",1428278400,,5659,4.674698795180723

Thorn needs to stop trying to look tough and sexy, the guy dies after betraying Bilbo and is only King for a few days.

Overall an excellent movie.

Note: People were complaining about Legolas.  How do you know where he was in the books? He wasn't in the books so it is creative license that allows him to be his father's confidante and right hand elf.  Don't criticize the best action hero of LOTR.

I loved the first Hobbit movie (An Unexpected Journey) but was dissapointed by Desolation of Smaug. In case you did not know, Smaug is a fire breathing dragon. He guards the treasure that is in the mountain cave.

Nothing is resolved in this movie. They wait until The Hobbit: Battle of The 5 Armies to wrap everything up. If you are going to watch the whole series, then go ahead an watch this one also. But by itself, this movie is nothing special. I wonder if it would have been better to shrink the 3 Hobbit movies into 2?

I thought the same would be for The Hobbit, but was sorely disappointed with An Unexpected Journey's Extended Edition. With only 15 minutes of new content, it's hard to distinguish what's new or not. And the scenes they did add didn't feel... necessary. I was worried Desolation of Smaug would be the same.

I was wrong. Desolation's Extended is worth it! Tons of new content, alternate scenes, new characters, new plot lines. It makes the whole movie feel new and more fleshed out. Get this one!",1425686400,,588,4.764705882352941

4627528,4,B0059XTU3G,"It's not nearly as good as the first of the Hobbit series.  The section in Mirkwood with the elves is unfortunate.  Almost comic-bookish.  It doesn't have nearly the depth and realism of the first one.  Bilbo, of course, pulls it off.  Martin Freeman is the perfect Bilbo - he has the maturity and experience as an actor to pull off the character of Bilbo with real depth and subtlety.  I wish that Jackson had rethought the issue of the river sequence - it really is too much in the CGI.  Not believable and detracts from the film rather than adding to it.  Also, as much as I like Tauriel, she doesn't need to be in the film to the extent that she is - her ""romance"" with Kili detracts, rather than contributes to the film.  Just my opinion - and I'm a romantic, just not a dime-novel romantic.  Anyway, the film is worth the reduced cost.

4627602,5,B0059XTU3G,"First, I must admit that I went to the theatre to see this film first.  I am a committed fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" books, including ""The Hobbit"", as well as Peter Jackson's film renditions.  Granted, the film does not exactly match the content of the books... but then, films never do!  Aside from the enormous amount of detail in each book that would be nearly impossible to include in a film, the fact is - people have come to expect ""creative license"" by film makers.  They wouldn't know how to  behave if any film maker kept true to the written word. (I suspect there would be even more complaining about how ""lousy"" the film is, if any film actually adhered to the written word of the novel it represents.)  All that aside, this was a great film!  I mean, depicting a living, breathing, big as a mountain dragon in film, and giving him a personality - that is a FEAT!  And Smaug has personality!  TONS of personality!  Gandalf is, of course, always fun to watch, and I was surprised by the presentation of Thorin Oakenshield as he fundamentally IS in the book!  Thorin Oakenshield did, indeed, become obsessed over the gold in his grandfather's vaults, and the Arkenstone had one HECK of a magical effect on his mind.  It drove him mad - but that detail is not as glaringly obvious in the book, as it is on screen. I thought that was particularly well done.  Yes, yes, I know, Jackson exercised poetic license, projecting a female high elf into the story... a love interest for Legolas Greenleaf, and a serious concern for his father.  While that was NOT in the book, I thought it made great cinema, and a believable twist to the story.  In  truth of fact, Legolas never married - he palled up with Gimli, Gloan's son, and lived his life in Middle Earth to the end as a lonely elf - I think he loved the High King more than life itself.  He sailed oversea to the Undying Lands with Gimli at the end of the age, which was deeply sad (for me) - but who can truly be sad forever is the Undying Lands!  That's Heaven - surely he would have found many friends there (and perhaps even love at last).  I thought Bilbo was fabulous... very believable, definitely wonderfully portrayed, and the entire film was fabulous.  Elrond's ""Last Homely House"" in Rivendell was so wonderful, I wanted to move right in.  Great movie!  Loved it totally.  (Another great twist was the flirtation between the Tauriel (the High Elf maiden bowman) and Ki'li the young Dwarf.  Whodathunkit on THAT one!  Several surprises and twists in the story of The Hobbit, giving it a fresh breath of air, I think - made it a most entertaining film!  I loved it!",1425081600,,2647,4.485355648535565

4627901,1,B0059XTU3G,"Mr. Jackson's rendering of the Hobbit to film completely replaces the beloved tale for one that is commercially viable for large video game profits. Jackson's public evisceration of Professor Tolkien's work is just another example of corporate short-term gain at the expense of long venerated publications. He has managed to transform high fantasy literature into a roller coaster ride to mediocrity. It is apparent that the studio executives thought of the audience as nothing more than a dull-witted goblin horde that would consume anything placed before it.

Read the book instead over a second breakfast. A walk in the woods afterward would give an unclouded appreciation of Tolkien's poetic masterpiece.

4627927,1,B0059XTU3G,"Clearly, anyone who has read the Hobbit and had any respect whatsoever for Tolkien would never have made this useless film.

It is a perfectly good story, and needs not the base additions and love stories that did not take place in the book. This movie may as well be titled, ""Hobbit - Peter Jackson's Desolation of Classic Literature.""

I have read the Hobbit to my children, they were greatly confused and kept telling me that they didn't remember that happening or that something didn't happen.

Seriously, gain some respect for one of the worlds greatest linguists and writers, J.R.R. Tolkien.

I hope the family NEVER releases the rights to the Silmarillion so Jackson can't screw that one up too. In the world of story telling it doesn't get any easier....the whole story is in a book, you just need to put it in a movie.

Mr. Jackson, has obvious talent in cinematography, but is a butcher when it comes to the art of story telling.",1423267200,5,939,4.632530120481928

4627959,4,B0059XTU3G,"The Desolation of Smaug is not a bad movie at all, and very entertaining & a lot of fun but there are some problems with this trilogy;

1.) The elf characters with their bows and arrows never miss.  I asked myself if these dudes are so awesome then why are they living in a kingdom hidden & underground?

2.) All three of these films are filled with little goblin creatures to the point of going beyond over the top that is almost pornographic just how many little goblins needlessly flood these films.  Peter Jackson must love goblins. Too many of them in these three films.

3.) Instead of fully following Tolkien's original story, Peter Jackson inserts his own invented characters into the film including this elf woman that for some reason loves this dwarf character.  She really isn't needed in the film, but since she is in here why on Earth throw a romance in this film at all when it isn' t believable nor needed? Don't get me wrong, I liked her character & the actress did well, but she seemed a bit out of place in the story.  The Orlando Bloom's Elf character on the other hand I really could not stand, simply because he is invincible so anything he does he masters with perfection, taking out hundreds of foes that get in his way with ease.  If there were to be a love interest placed in this film, then why not have the woman go with Orlando Bloom's Elf character instead of this dumb attraction to the dwarf???

4.) Smaug the dragon is awesome, ghoulishly dark, powerful, intelligent, and sinister.  But here is the problem the way Jackson depicts him, he talks WAY too much during the film engaging in full conversations when it isn't needed.  Sure throw in a few lines here and there but slithering or flying around carrying on huge conversations really is not needed at all in this film, I felt like telling Smaug, ""Hey shut up and just fly around and breath some fire for Christ's sake!""  Obviously Peter Jackson doesn't get the hint that some times less is more with some creature characters, think of ""Jaws"" where the shark doesn't make an appearance until the very last act of the film when Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw finally run into him or her.  Smaug's appearance and effects in the film are awesome and stunning CGI wise, but why have him engage in such constant diolague when all he needs to do is guard the treasure and attack the heroes???

5.) Oakenshield the leader of the dwarfs to me is not a nice guy, nor a character that is likable in anyway.  He treats the Hobbit like garbage for most of these three films and barely redeems himself from his previous lust for power and greed.  Maybe that was by design even from the original novel material, but as a fan I sort of want to like the characters who go through the magical mythological journey, but instead I found myself saying, ""This dude is a jerk off!""

6.) Way too many dwarf characters, and no matter what happens like the elf warrior who uses his bow and arrow they are pretty much invincible to the point that we do not feel the danger as the audience when there are scenes they encounter Smaug or other hostile forces.  Obviously Jackson loves these characters, but most people would like to see maybe.... 7 dwarfs instead of such a high number to accompany Oakenshield and the Hobbit on this adventure.

 The film has amazing special effects and scenery, very good acting and fun characters both good and bad, but I found many things including this never ending sequence down a log flume river to go on a bit too long. The character who changes into a giant wolf creature was interesting, but he was only there for a quick ""jee whiz"" effect and had no other impact on the story.

 The CGI scenery is beautiful through out the film, as are the natural settings from New Zealand.  We have a lot of great fantasy imagry here and for that alone I thought it makes the film watchable, and interesting.  The actor who plays the Hobbit also does a very fine job, we really believe he is Bilbo Baggens and he is very likable.",1423008000,,4014,4.474622770919067

4628007,5,B0059XTU3G,"There are two types of people:  those who think that Tolkien fantasy should be limited to a reasonable amount of your life (or none of your life) and those who cannot conceive of a universe in which there is too much Tolkien.  If you're part of the latter, then I'm preaching to the choir.  If you're of the former lot, then you wouldn't read this review and so I'll not waste time addressing you any more.

Does this film stay true to the original work?  Of course not!  Does this film give you hours of elf-y ork-y fantasy bliss?  Heavens yes!  I for one love the original Tolkien, and I love these films which are not true to the spirit or letter of the books.  Go re-read the books - they are wonderful!  Watch this endless beautiful fantasy.  It's very different and very wonderful too.  The books are full of wit.  The films lack wit, but they offer a visual masterpiece, which is a tremendous thing.  Tolkein's Gandolf and Bilbo were characters full of terrific British cleverness and luck.  Kippling, and Dahl and Milne taught us to love this thing that Tolkien gave us too and it is a thing of books...not a thing of film.  If film is our modern theater then let these movies be judged as such and in that court they are great works.  Enjoy this three hour indulgence of theater and art.  Also...go re-read the books they are great too.",1422748800,,1345,4.420408163265306

4628111,1,B0059XTU3G,"As someone who really loved the original LOTR films, and who didn't think the first Hobbit film was that bad, this one was really a huge disappointment. I'm not arguing from the point of view that most of the content wasn't at all in the Hobbit book, but rather that they crafted what feels like hours of PADDING to bridge two films worth of story into three. And oh how this film DRAGS. The sequences with the lake people is just a chore to get through, and I can only take so much of the damp, cold and boring lake people, that seemingly have nothing to do with the plot other than to drag things out. The other problem is the ridiculous, cartoon-like and overly-CGI sequences such as the river barrel escape scene, which was just cringe-worthy as Legolas is jumping from barrel to barrel. Just awful. Peter Jackson seems to have gone full George Lucas with this, working in far too much soulless computer animation and visuals balanced out with shallow character development. And he completely failed, in my opinion, with bringing in Legolas into this story.  It's not as much a book thing as it is the fact that he just doesn't seem to belong here, and for some strange reason, Orlando Bloom just seems to look OLDER and far too caked with makeup.  Compared to LOTR he looks young and vital - here, he's just a computer-augmented effect with a ton of foundation on his face. And enough with the gimmicks such as Legolas seeing Gimli's baby picture - yeah, we get it, we know who he is - just quit assuming we're all idiots and need such blatant bridges.
The final sequence (spoilers) with the giant gold drawf statue just seemed unnecessarily ridiculous and completely pointless. Smaug just shook it off, Bilbo wonders a cliche ""what have we done"" and that's it? I'll tell you what you've done: you've dragged out a great book into an unnecessary three films when two probably would have worked, and this film could have been avoided.",1422316800,25,1938,4.598265895953757

How about a movie or two devoted to Gollum's life; his transformation and trials. Or how about one based on Gandolf? Or the Elves?

I just dismiss criticism I see from others that some things are just unbelievable.  It's a make believe world with creatures and abilities that aren't plausible in the real world,  Seriously folks, a ring that makes you disappear and can't be destroyed that corrupts and extends life, Elfs who live thousands of years, Wizards with great power, dwarfs and orcs.  It's science fiction, people do extraordinary feats are the norm.  Jackson brings this world to life, he ties the stories together, which in the grand scheme The Hobbit story leads to the events and story in the  Lords of the Rings.

Plus how the movie was made; the costumes/weapons, etc; get to know the actors and Peter Jackson...on and on. The appendices themselves are about as long as the individual movies.

infer from that statement that Windows computers might be compatible

4628594,4,B0059XTU3G,"Sadly, it's easy to complain about the Hobbit movies. The term ""fan fiction"" has been thrown about repeatedly.

It's clear that Jackson and his colleagues have added plot points - quite a bit of them. However, the goal of these films for me has always been to create a visual universe to showcase Tolkien's creations, and Jackson does it beautifully. Although the first film in the series got a bit tiresome (I probably don't need to see the dwarf drunken meal scene again), there are no scenes in this film that feel extraneous. Some of the dialogue seemed a bit forced (Gandalf to Radagast with a '90's cop-show -like ""Don't try to come in after me"" seemed poorly written), but the scenes following the dwarves and Bilbo were constantly good.",1420416000,,744,4.723076923076923

The scenes with the dragon were unbelievable, nothing obeyed the laws of physics, or any laws of nature. Sure the dragon is magic, but not everything else in the world is. The movie Jaws is a good model, you shouldnt see too much of the monster if you cannot get it working right.

Turns out I really didn't miss a lot.  The only times the movie was a lot of fun was when Bilbo (Martin Freeman) or Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) were on screen.  Both carried the show.  The dwarfs were boring, elves likewise.  I was rooting for the orcs to have some dwarf for dinner but sadly never happened.  The book was HUGE fun, but it didn't translate well here.  Go ahead and watch - it's not half bad for an action flick, but for a screen rendition of The Hobbit, not so much.  One more movie to go, then it's over!

4628778,2,B0059XTU3G,"This review is primarily concerning the bookend set for The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. I would write a different review if this were only about the movie. But if you think that these bookends are going to be like the awesome ones that came with The Fellowship of the Ring, don't be fooled!

I bought this set, excited to have another cool pair of bookends. They were of crappy quality, made in China, weighed very little and the design was not overly detailed at close range. The axes were chipped, but not because they were supposed to look like real stone. One axe looked like it had been glued back on with some form of black cement that stuck out from the side. At a distance, they look very nice, but up close, they are not.

If you have the Argonath statues from The Fellowship of the Ring set, be thankful. These are nothing like them, so pass on this set and just get the DVDs. Whatever company was put in charge of this did not do their job very well. And the chips and broken quality did not appear to be caused by Amazon's packing job. It looked like they were already like that when they were put in the box, which says more for the maker than the deliverer. I immediately packaged them up (carefully) and sent them back. Thankful that Amazon has such a good return policy.

Again, the 2 stars are NOT for the DVD/Bluray movie, which I regretfully sent back with the set. I will buy it separately, after this.",1420156800,,1423,4.362264150943396

Director Peter Jackson still knows how to make an epic film and all, but the special effects in this particular movie looked downright cheesy and had an almost ""video-game"" quality to them ... In a word: CHEAP!  That's how they looked to me.  The storyline itself kept me on the edge of my seat, as to be expected from someone as talented as Jackson, but I still couldn't get over the LOOK of the special effects in this film.  Yeah, it's okay ... but it could have been done so much better!!  Looks to me like some ""time constraints"" may have been the factor?  Who knows?",1419897600,,745,4.386861313868613

I popped in Gravity and Titanic and the 3D is spectacular.  So it's not my player.  I exchanged for another one and same problem, but a tad bit less ghosting.  I paid over $40 for this piece of s*&% and for this quality?  No thanks.  If you play the non 3D bluray and use your TV to convert from 2D to 3D, the 3D in it is even better than the 3D bluray.

The group's youngest dwarf and a female elf develop a relationship in the film that make's the films intermission between action sequences viewable and somewhat interesting. The film's other saving grace is an awesome villian, Smaug the Dragon. He may surmount Gollum in being the greatest character in the LOTR film world. He's clever, cunning, and a visual wonder.

Not just boring director conv like the movies.  The second disc  (Part 10)  goes into how they created Smog and other features in the films.  Also incredible.

This is also the directors cut which is over 30min longer than the theater version.  Both are good, but i opt for the longer one as it includes extra scenes.",1419638400,,581,4.598039215686274

As far as the movie goes, I literally could not wait for the end. By that I mean that I was unable to force myself to watch the movie all the way through. Not only did I fast forward through all of the absurd video game-like action scenes, I just turned the movie off when the dwarves started fighting Smaug. I found myself yelling at the screen in utter disbelief. I don't know whose brainchild this screenplay was hatched from, but it is so bad that I would rather not see the final movie, ever. I regret buying this. I regret having witnessed any part of this movie. If I could do it all over, I would play solitaire for two hours, and I would be wiser for it.

4629190,3,B0059XTU3G,"As a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings [LOTR] movies, and especially of the Extended Edition DVD's, I find this offering a bit below par.

Obviously, those of us who were won over by Jackson initially will get these collector editions even if they suck.

And we should: there are more scenes, longer scenes, and the making-of segments continue to be generous and unparalleled in quality.  If you love the film, there's more of it.  If you hate it, there's a lot of documentary evidence about how creative decisions  came to be made and executed.

But love the film adaptations or hate them (I hate the Hobbit), Jackson has built up a store of credit that keeps one looking for jewels.  (Two jewels: Stephen Fry and Stephen Colbert in the commentaries.)

But both the scene-additions and the extras tend to magnify the strengths and weaknesses of The Hobbit compared to the Lord of the Rings.

Some object to the movies because they depart from the book: for them, the charming scene where Beorn meets the Dwarves is restored.  As usual when Peter Jackson stays close to Tolkien's spirit, he visualizes the event with affection and charm.

Some object to the movies because of the harebrained addiction to action sequences that add nothing to the story: they will be glad to learn that, in the behind-the-scenes material, Jackson admits the Dwarves' fight with the Dragon actually was as tacked-on and improvised as it feels.

My objection isn't so much that the film departs from the book (though I think it's weakest on its own terms when it does).

Rather, somewhere between the two franchises, attention to detail became self-indulgence.  Jackson's love of Tolkien and love of his audience and a desire to bring the two together got lost somewhere in The Hobbit.  All the careful attention to detail doesn't add up to much if the audience isn't made to really care about the characters a lot more than one does for the average video-game protagonist.  The Extended Edition helps with that a bit, giving us more lingering looks at the characters we need to care about.  But it more often wastes yet more of our time.

For example, the behind-the-scenes (BTS) footage lingers forever over such distasteful Jackson additions as the testicle-eating-scene (fully ten minutes of the BTS footage) and the Dwarves-up-through-the-toilet scene: I'm not squeamish, but this represents a much greater leap from the Edwardian sensibilities that guide Tolkien's book than was ever necessary to bring Tolkien and a modern audience together.  It slaps Tolkien in the face as it uses his material.  It's not that you have to be a slave to Tolkien: it's that love for Tolkien was what made LOTR movies so fantastic.

It's not that I have anything against gross-out humor.  I don't mind it more than the next average civilized being.  Nor am I a slave to The-Book-Was-Better creed (though of course it was).

Rather, it's that such stuff abandons the delicate balance Jackson struck in his LOTR films that respected Tolkien's sensibilities as well as the demands of a modern audience.  Those films gave us something unexpected and interesting, not something we could have gotten from Hollywood.  Those films honestly bought and paid for the right to deliver their messages about despair and optimism and good and evil and heroic sacrifice.

The Hobbit's new stuff is sometimes amusing, but it frequently panders.  If it's a step above fantasy self-parody, it's only because vestiges of Tolkien remain; but they remain only because Jackson didn't actively look for ways to cheapen them, not out of the deep affection that marked the LOTR films.  Tacking on orc-battles in Laketown that weren't in the book doesn't offend me; having them add nothing substantial to the story kind of wastes my time.  I've got World of Warcraft for that.  Scatological humor doesn't offend me: but it adds nothing while proving one more of Jackson's incessant jabs at Tolkien that say, ""Relax.  I'm just having fun.""  Now and then, it works.  But a few too many of those moments and the story loses a good bit of its soul.

That said, a lot of people thought The Hobbit movies were great, and they'll find more to rave about.  As always with Peter Jackson, the Extended Editions are a mixture of really compelling scenes and a few tack-ons that only fans could enjoy.  The Behind the Scenes stuff is generally excellent, amusing, and interesting, though not so lean and well-edited as in the LOTR collector's editions.

As always, the craftsmanship of WETA and the superiority of the New Zealand approach to film-making are much in evidence, even if the results are a lot more Hollywood this time around.  There's also less of a pioneer spirit and more of a business-as-usual spirit to it, which will happen with success. But I sometimes miss the almost Zen-like spirit of the LOTR's film-craft that emptied all preconceptions in favor of serving the books and fans of the books.  These Hobbit films are more apt to serve fans of Jackson than Tolkien.

I'll always get Jackson's Middle Earth Extended Editions, because I think at his best Jackson knows what he's doing.  When he loses his way, it's interesting and instructive.  And well-documented.",1419465600,2,5213,4.882821387940842

4629221,4,B0059XTU3G,"Peter Jackson has created a legacy thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien. Then he goes and takes the shortest novel and creates a trilogy. Is that good or bad? You be your own judge.

In the second installment of The Hobbit trilogy, we have already covered about two thirds of the book, now the question is how do we make a 2+ hour movie out of it and still have room for a third? Let's make some stuff up! Don't get me wrong the film is a good watch, but just knowing that a large portion of this film is nothing but Jackson fan fiction would not make you proud as a fan of these films. I will say that the highlight of the film is Smaug himself, brilliantly voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. Still, I just didn't feel so great leaving the theater after the film was over. I kinda felt a bit dirty.

Now, the extended edition won me over just like the extended version of The Two Towers. Once again a film that felt broken and filled with a few holes was given a makeover adding character development and re-created scenes that are more like what occurs in the novel. I prefered this version and did end up feeling much better towards the film as a whole. I am glad, because now I am feeling a little better about The Battle of the Five Armies. I am sure that if I feel the same was after that one ends the extended edition will more than make up for it.",1419379200,2,1340,4.1698841698841695

All the other expanded editions for LotR and the first part of the Hobbit set an expectation, which this failed to live up to. Overall, I was quite disappointed.

Spoilers:

The plot is as follows. We rejoin the quest of 13 dwarves and Bilbo Baggins, as they are traveling toward the lonely mountain. They come across a number of obstacles - the orc hunting party, a magical forest that makes the party easy prey for giant spiders within it, wood elves that imprison them, and so on. The most significant scene that is expanded from the theatrical version is where Gandalf enters the necromancer's lair. In it, Thorin's father attacks him, apparently in thrall to some dark powers. Gandalf pins him down and frees him from that influence, not unlike Rohan's king in LotR.

There are other scenes expanded, but none that seemed to really affect the story in any significant way. This is the only extended edition in this series that I felt it wasn't worth the wait.",1419206400,,1084,4.664921465968586

4629388,4,B0059XTU3G,"I don't know how one is supposed to turn a rather short book like J.R.R. Tolkien's THE HOBBIT into a trilogy, but that's exactly what Peter Jackson has done.  No stranger to Middle-Earth, having helmed the phenomenal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, the best things that can be said about his re-imagining of this classic tale is that at least the production values and acting are on par with its predecessors.  As with the aforementioned trio, THE HOBBIT was shot back-to-back in New Zealand, resulting in the release of one sequel per year.  For better or worse, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY kicked off what would be an all new adventure, albeit on a rather sluggish pace, particularly its overlong dinner party sequence and character introductions that made up most of its first half.

Luckily those problems do not extend to the second part of the trilogy, here titled THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.  Having already established the cast, the film picks up from where we left our heroes after being rescued from orcs by eagles.  The pace is certainly tighter and less slow, although there still is the occasional lag.  The film begins, oddly, with another prologue scene:  this time a conversation between the battle-hardened dwarf prince Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the ever-wise Gandalf (Ian MacKellen).  After that we cut back to where we last left the Hobbit and his dwarf companions.  As before, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG really comes alive during the moments which readers are familiar with.  Lots of new hazards await our heroes in the form of monstrous spiders, suspicious elves, more and more orcs, corrupt townsfolk, and ultimately, the titular villain himself.

Speaking of which, the crowning jewel of this second part is the fated scene where Bilbo confronts Smaug the dragon in his treasure-laden lair.  Like Gollum, the folks at Weta Workshop, through the wizardry of motion capture technology do a bang-up job of rendering this beast a truly dangerous, terrifying monster.  Benedict Cumberbatch, too, deserves credit not only for performing the motion capture movements of the dragon (similar to Andy Serkis as Gollum), but for providing the beast with a rumbling, floor-shaking baritone that sends chills up one's spine.  For audiences more familiar with Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman (Bilbo) as Watson, the scene, perhaps unintentionally, is also dryly amusing if you make the connection.  Either way, Smaug is a real triumph, emerging as one of cinema's greatest dragons.

That said, DESOLATION OF SMAUG takes quite a while to get there, and as with its predecessor, it ultimately depends on whether the viewer is prepared to accept the changes and additions Jackson made from the book, appreciate the film at face value, or are prepared to grumble with disappointment.  En route, the film zigzags back and forth between talky bits and CGI effects as well as other additions.  The fight with the spiders in the Mirkwood forest is chillingly handled and builds to its climax with true terror, the arachnids themselves being the stuff of nightmares.  There's also an extensive roller-coaster style escape in which our heroes escape downriver in barrels while dodging attacking orcs.  For the most part this sequence is viscerally exciting, but there are a FEW moments when it gets a bit silly, particularly in the sometimes implausible choreography of the elves as they fight back against the attackers.  There's an even lengthier showdown between the dwarves and the dragon in the Misty Mountain which mostly works on a crowd-pleasing level (especially for audiences who want to see Thorin face off against the beast that destroyed his home), but may infuriate Tolkien loyalists expecting an untarnished adaptation what they see as a work of art.

Then there's the inclusion of two new characters, one of who is familiar to audiences of LORD OF THE RINGS, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and a skillful she-elf named Tauriel.  While it's nice to see Legolas again, I'm not quite sure what Jackson is going for by including him in the incidents where the dwarves are taken prisoner.  There's also an implied ""love story"" subplot between the youngest of the dwarves and Tauriel which, although not fatal to the film, is a curious addition nonetheless.  We also Gandalf and Radagast (Sylvestor MacCoy) trail a mysterious evil to stone ruins, which turns out to be the ghost of the major baddie from THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  This is obviously meant to tie THE HOBBIT to the more famous trilogy, which is quite understandable given that this is, after all, a prequel to LORD OF THE RINGS.  Lake Town is also stunningly realized as a destitute but simultaneously seedy village with a corrupt mayor.  Luke Evans also makes a very pleasing Bard, and the addition of his family brings a lot of emotional weight to his character.

In short, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG's length and additions will understandably annoy anyone expecting Jackson to adapt the novel more ""accurately"", but my ""criticisms"" are mostly just shameless nit-picking, because on the whole I really did enjoy THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.  It's certainly more frantic than its predecessor and never boring.  The only major drawback of the movie is its cliffhanger ending.  This is intentional and meant to make audiences come back for the final film, but it's still done in a way that feels very abrupt.  On that level, then, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is not meant to be a standalone film, but a two-parter in the same way that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS ended up being.

Love it or hate it, Jackson's enthusiasm for the material still shines through even in places where it occasionally goes off the rails.  While it may be in the shadow of its predecessor trilogy, it's nonetheless great to go on another adventure with Jackson, Weta, and company.",1418947200,2,5830,4.992761116856257

I gave this 4 stars because of my particular interest in this genre.  Would I give this four stars when comparing it to every movie?  No, I would not.  Probably more like 3 stars.

It is better than the first, very interesting and progresses the story nicely.  IMO, there is too much CGI and Jackson did a better job with the LOTR, which was a better story in the first place.  The acting was also very good in this movie.

Overall, if you are a fan of this genre, you should watch it (I know, everyone who's a fan has already watched it).  If you are not a fan, there probably isn't much intrigue.",1418688000,2,715,4.237037037037037

The budding romance between Tauriel and whichever dwarf obviously didn't have much basis in the source material, but its irrelevance in the film neither added nor detracted from it.

At the end of the day, this movie puts you back in an amazing world full of interesting characters and goings-on which, when coupled with the brilliance of the SFX, made for a generally good time. I've been told that my desire for a more serious LotR-esque film is unrealistic given the target audience of the book, which is apparently young adults, yet I can't help but feel as if there was a lot of poetic license taken with this adaptation overall, which has thus far resulted in a watered down version of a childhood favorite.

4629641,2,B0059XTU3G,"I'll try not to duplicate what others have already stated, but all I can say is this is a clear example of biting off more than you can chew.  Peter Jackson is certainly talented, but this was way to much for him, or anyone for that matter, to handle (and probably had a lot to do with the powers that be in the production studio as well).  You can see it on the actors faces, in the video game-esque cgi and in the jumpy plot and ridiculous dialogue.  It feels rushed, disconjointed and just falls flat on it's face.  Lesson to be learned:  when faced with an increadibly complex story; break it down to the most simplistic idea of the film and build what you can off of that.  This should have been a story about Bilbo Baggins but I felt like I hardly knew who he was in all of this.  The ONE redeeming quality of this film, and I congratulate the people who worked on it, was the dragon Smaug.  In Bilbo's words, he did not disappoint.  The CGI on this part of the film was absolutely stunning, and not coincidentally, the only part of the movie I could watch.  Even still, this scene - the most important scene in the whole story - was completely botched.  We see absolutely no transition of Bilbo's character here as he quivers in his boots trying to edge off the screen.  I can only hope that the third movie makes a miraculous redemption of the first two, but I won't hold my breath.",1418256000,2,1390,4.263358778625954

No, it's not up to the level of The Lord of the Rings movies perhaps, but seriously... how many movies are?

4629845,5,B0059XTU3G,"I really love J.R.R. Tolkien's works and have read everything he has ever written, including the later compilations and commentaries by his son Christopher.  Although I am tempted to deny it at least a star for the way Peter Jackson deviated not only from the text of the works, but in many instances from the meaning Tolkien intended, I shall refrain from doing so because of the quality of the production, and the technical aspects of the reproduction for 3D, otherwise.

I mean, I really can't complain about the addition of Tauriel as a character.  That is one HECK of an easy-to-look-at and otherwise intriguing woman!  And this did not stray as far from Tolkien's intentions and meanings Jackson did in, say ""The Two Towers.""

But I recently got a high-end 65"" Samsung 3D TV, and the active 3D effect when watched on the Samsung surpasses the experience at the very high-tech iMax theater in which I watched this for the first time.  It was more realistic, more detailed, and my eyes were better able to follow the really hectic action during the escape down the stream from the dungeons in the Elvenking's Hall.

I LOVE the additional Beorn scenes, and also the restoration of the scene at the river where they shoot the hart and Bombur falls in the water, which pleased me almost as much as the inclusion of ""The Voice of Saruman"" in the extended edition of ""The Two Towers.""  Why on EARTH was that critical scene cut from the theatrical release???  Was it for more pointless fighting at Helm's Deep?

Peter Jackson did these movies with such a flair for technical elegance and cinematographic excellence.  The sets and the casting, with only a few exceptions, very nearly matched the scenery and characters as I had seen them for so many years in my mind's eye.  I just so deeply wish he had adhered a little more closely to the stories themselves, because I doubt that I will live long enough to see these remade as they should've been.",1417910400,,1946,4.657894736842105

I love the movie, but I would always encourage people to read the book first (or if that ship has sailed, read the book second).  Obviously, the movie has to condense and cut things out of the story to fit into the time frame so reading the book gives you the whole story and you get to experience Tolkien's love of languages and his humor in greater detail in the book.  Still love the movie though.",1417651200,,545,4.211538461538462

4629909,5,B0059XTU3G,"Part 2 in the hobbit movie series. I absolutely love the book and the movie did not disappoint. Was it 100% accurate to the book? Not by a long shot, however Hollywood did make things more exciting in areas of the movie that would have otherwise been dull in the book. The special effects are top notch and many small details from the book were included in the extended edition. Some areas of the movie had to be interpreted since the author of the book never delved into the details of certain events. In this aspect I feel the writers for the movie did a good job by maintaining the original theme and plot of the book.

Pros:
Stunning special effects.
Excellent cast.
Excellent music.
True to the original main theme/plot of the book.
Great character depth.
Amazing work/detail done for bringing Middle Earth to life as described in the text of ""The Hobbit"".

Cons:
Legolas was never in the original Hobbit text, yet plays an important side role in the movie.
The entire barrel riding scene with the Orcs attacking was never in the book (exciting to watch though).
The female Elf and Dwarf relationship was never in the book (interesting side story though).
The major threat/army in the book were Goblins not Orcs.
The Pale Orc was mentioned in the Lord of the Rings book trilogy, but never participated in the events of the Hobbit storyline.
Contrary to the movie, Bjorn is not the last ""Skin Changer"" to exist in Middle Earth.
According to the movie there's already a relationship between Smaug and Sauron, this was not true in the book.

I could go on with more inconsistencies and deviations from the book. But I understand why all of these changes were made. The original Hobbit text has some very dry/boring moments that would kill the interest for most viewers if a direct text to screen movie was made. I don't agree with all the changes rolled out, but as a whole I believe this 3-part movie franchise is still fantastic. A lot of character depth was added in areas where it didn't exist before(in the original book) and the adventure has become far more exciting and wondrous.",1417651200,,2089,4.640540540540541

What I want to tell you is this extended version delivers big time on additional, significant content. I can understand there may be skepticism among those who bought the extended edition of Unexpected Journey, which has negligible value over the standard release. I do not advise buying The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Extended Edition, as the additional content is very minor, to the point of insignificance. The Desolation of Smaug, however, delivers.

4629949,5,B0059XTU3G,"This is a review of the (3) disc Blu-Ray extended edition of The Hobbit part 2: The Desolation of Smaug, which finally came out a few weeks ago, and I just finished watching today.  There's also one of those ""ultraviolet"" vouchers you can use to view it on other devices.  Keep in mind, at pretty much the same time there was also released a FIVE disc version containing extended Desolation of Smaug in 3-D (2 discs), extended Desolation of Smaug ""normal"" Blu-Ray (one disc), and the same 2 discs of Appendices called 9 and 10.

I've had so many versions of Lord of the Rings, and now the Hobbit, that I kinda lost track of the numbering for these appendices.  I think the way it ends up, with the extended edition of Lord of the Rings, movie 1 had appendices 1 and 2, movie 2 had 3 and 4, movie 3 had 5 and 6, and with the extended first film of The Hobbit had 7 and 8, which gives us 9 and 10 with Hobbit film 2.

As the manufacturer's review and dust jacket and other reviews all say, the extended edition of the film itself adds 25 minutes-for a total of 3 hours 6 minutes for the movie.  There's also a very short ""filming in New Zealand"" feature, only 7 minutes long, which recaps some of the spectacularly beautiful exterior locations they used in Desolation of Smaug (clearly Paradise, where they located Beorn's house, must hands-down be the most beautiful, but the river which they used for barrel-ride scenery in my opinion would be a second.

As for the extra 25 minutes: without dwelling on them at length, I would say that while not all of it may be quite from the books, it was all very well-done and well-integrated with the rest of the film, and might help someone who never read all the books (that is, both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings) understand a little better what is going on in the story.

As for the Appendices 9 and 10, this is what is really new to the extended version.  One is 5 hours total, and the other is 5 hours 6 minutes.  Adding those, plus the movie, plus the short-short gives us a massive 13 hrs 19 minutes of viewing time.  And I must say, I enjoyed virtually every minute of it (though that's why I spent about a week getting through it all.  The Appendices to this film are a very extensive ""making-of"", but not the kind of ""making of"" that you so often see in other films, half of which consists of clips of the movie itself, and the other half consisting of the director and actors and cinematographer etc. all congratulating themselves on what a great job they did.  No, no, no, this was (in typical Peter Jackson style), a mixture of him and members of his crew showing us how they tackled filming various scenes, interspersed with snippets of casting interviews and the actors talking about how they got selected, interspersed with the actors goofing off with each other on-set in between takes, and sometimes with the actors giving Jackson a hard time (or him getting them back, often as he talks to us, the audience).  I haven't been in the film business but it seems an open secret that often actors HATE directors (and vice versa) for a variety of reasons: often it's because the director has a very strict vision of what he wants to see in the film and won't tolerate any deviation from what he's trying to get, even if the actors don't understand exactly what that is.  On the other extreme are directors (especially comedy movies with great comedians) who let them ad-lib as much as they want, and often use whatever parts they like the best.  Or (another type of director actors don't much care for) the ones who are very into the technology of the filmmaking, but lousy at giving actors explanations of what they want from them in a scene.  Jackson clearly has (almost always) clear visions of what he wants to see, but he also involves the actors in the process, particularly in how they deliver their lines.  Which leads to what I suspect would be the one universal complaint the actors would have, if they had to pick any complaint about working in these films: SO MANY TAKES.  The appendices (long as they are) only hint at how many takes are actually done for many scenes, but he'll do it over and over again until he finds one performance he feels is perfect (or synthesizes pieces from several takes into the perfect sequence).  And if there's one thing I think the actors, the crew and we audiences alike can all admire about Jackson is his absolutely incredible attention to details.  So many fine details appear in many of his sets---unfortunately stuff the audience will never even SEE (except you get to see some of it in these appendices) but which, in the ""real"" sets, are all there to make the actors feel they're in a real middle-earth world.  There are many quite memorable moments in these appendices: Steven Colbert and his family visiting and all being put into the move; Ian McKellon fooling Peter Jackson; Jackson's disastrous attempt at a cameo appearance in Laketown; the unbelievable insanity of the rush to produce the final 20 minutes of the film (which were delivered late in the end); the problems of converting a 2-film plan into a 3-film plan; some erudite discussions by scholars of the derivation of some of Tolkien's ideas which first appear in the Hobbit, and so much more.  The appendices are alternately fascinating, funny, touching, enlightening, but almost always great watching for anyone who enjoys the movie.

Yes there are always problems turning books into movies (typified by complaints I think I've heard 1,000 times ""the book was SO MUCH BETTER"").  I read the books, I imagined the scenes myself, and I've watched the movies (except the final Hobbit film).  All 3 are excellent.  Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth is superb.  Even where you find that some actor isn't quite how you pictured them, or some detail in the book was left out, or some dialog in the film was added, as far as I'm concerned it all produces the effect of bringing the books to the screen in a way which nobody else could ever do.  These will, I think, remain the definitive film versions of both Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.  When I first heard that little book, the Hobbit, was to be 3 whole films, my reaction was ""NO WAY!""  After watching just the first film, that had already changed to, ""Way!""  Now, before even seeing it, I'm already sad that the third Hobbit film is probably the last of Tolkien we'll see directed by Jackson and with this cast.  Almost everyone already knows whether they like or don't like The Hobbit.  If you do like it, do yourself a favor and get the extended editions of all 3 films.",1417478400,4,6600,4.532434709351306
4629950,5,B0059XTU3G,"For doing a action pack movie I think Peter Jackson did a great Job  on this for film. I won't debate the merits of book versus movie as for most times, their are always things that won't match the imagination one imparts when they read a book versus someone else's imagination when they try to adapt it to film. (That has been done by numerous others in other post ) To name a few films that were very good film adaptions  but still did not match the book are Jaws, Jurassic Park (though I still enjoyed the films). So it is with the Hobbit.  to make it action pack for today's audience and for keeping a 2 hour time constraints in movie time (although Jackson gets around this by making it into 3 parts) I think he does an admirable job and can think of no one else that could have pulled this off as well as he did  for the Hobbit or  the trilogy of Lord of the Rings .",1417478400,,872,4.076023391812866

4630044,1,B0059XTU3G,"I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings when I was twelve and thirteen, respectively. (It was right around the time Star Wars came out, which created a perfect storm of science fiction and fantasy.) What I loved most about The Hobbit was its essential YA-ness: it's the story of a small, seemingly insignificant person who grows up, finds his courage, and discovers his place in the larger world.

Which is why I so thoroughly despise what Peter Jackson has done to Tolkien's story in his three-part Hobbit extravaganza.

Now, look, I'm not dumb. I know movies are inherently different from the books on which they're based. I loved The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, different though it was from its source material. I thought Jackson and his crew made excellent decisions in those films.

I think they've made horrible decisions in The Hobbit.

I hated the first movie. (If you want to know why, see my review.) I didn't think I could hate the second one any more. But I did.

The reasons are many, but here's a start.

--CGI madness. Jackson used to be a director who liked to work with actual actors and physical effects. For all the lavish CGI of The Lord of the Rings, he never forgot the humanity of his story--which started with relying to a great extent on actual people and actual places. But ever since King Kong, he's decided he doesn't want to direct movies anymore; he wants to direct video games. So we get computer-generated orcs, computer-generated actors, computer-generated settings, computer-generated action, computer-generated everything, all of it looking weightless and implausible and unreal (as when the dwarfs' barrels careen upright down raging rapids without tipping over once), all of it making a hash of Tolkien's lovingly crafted fantasy world.

--Tone deaf. Jackson used to know his way around a scene. Watch the arming of Theoden in The Two Towers, or Pippin's song in The Return of the King. Both of them contain brilliant combinations of poetry, arresting visuals, cross-cutting, lighting effects, and (yes, indeed) human emotion. But lately, Jackson doesn't seem to know how to film a scene with lyricism, restraint, humanity: all he knows is loud, louder, and louder still. It's less like watching a movie than listening to your next-door neighbor scream at his wife for three straight hours.

--Everything but the kitchen sink. I could hardly keep track of all the stuff going on in this unholy mess of a movie. We've got orcs attacking Lake Town! Gandalf storming Dol Guldur! A romance between an elf and a dwarf! Political intrigue between Bard and the Master! A dwarf dying of a poisoned arrow wound! Thorin and company relighting their forges to fight Smaug with a giant golden statue! (Huh?) Orlando Bloom looking old and fat and tired and ticked-off that ten years after his career was supposed to blossom, he's back fighting cartoon ape-orcs while his CGI figure leaps from head to head of barrel-riding dwarfs (who, I hasten to remind, magically remain upright while their barrels fly over waterfalls)! The only thing we didn't see much of--in fact barely saw anything of--was Bilbo's development as unlikely hero. I guess that wasn't exciting enough for Jackson.

In short, everything in The Desecration of Smaug (did I say that?) cuts against what I love about Tolkien's story: its intimate scale, its humanity, its quirkiness, its heart. Jackson decided to tell yet another big, loud, scream-at-the-audience-for-attention amusement park ride of a movie, and in so doing he killed everything that makes his source material great.

God only knows what the final installment will be like. All I know is it won't be anything like The Hobbit.",1417305600,11,3692,4.949919224555735

Being a long time fan of the hobbit, I was excited to see the movie on the big screen.  After the first one being awful, I thought that with Smaug the series would have to get better.  I was wrong, every scene Peter Jackson chose to deviate from the plot, theme and characters as they were depicted in the book.  The changes make for a movie that is painful to watch.  Furthermore, I am unsure who the audience for this movie is, certainly not Tolkien fans.  If it's a kids movie why are their heads being lopped off? Yet I feel young children are the only people that can enjoy this silly movie.

After making such a fine trilogy of Lord of the rings, and doing a fairly decent job of the first Hobbit  (Unexpected Journey), we are insulted with this piece of video game-like trash. Action scenes are way over the top with the most phony looking moves outside of Donkey Kong. Elves bounding from shore to shore along the river shooting an endless supply of arrows into hapless, incompetent Orcs. Collapsing bridges conveniently landing dwarfs on bridges below, and when they do fall no one is even shaken up! What tripe. I won't even get into the butchery done to a wonderful, classic story. It seems to be politically correct nowadays to include a super female into the fighting scenes, but nowhere in the Hobbit do you find a ""Tauriel"". For that matter Legolas was no part of the Hobbit either.
I guess what really irks me though is how this movie was drawn out in the name of greed. Lord of the rings was done in 3 movies and it is at least 3 times as long as the Hobbit. Got to make that almighty buck and art be damned! I am most irritated by being sucked into this trash by the fair effort to the start of the trilogy (Unexpected Journey).

The entire journey from Beorn's house to the Lonely Mountain, is filled with thrills.  Bilbo Baggins proves that he is much more than just a Hobbit.  When he saves the dwarves from the spiders and the woodland elves.  This film also brings out the lure of the dwarves lost treasure, and Thorin Oakenshield's lust for the gold inside the mountain.  That lust would help to set the stage for the final battle between the five armies.  I definitely recommend this film, especially the extended version.  JRV",1417132800,,693,4.913793103448276

The DVDs were shipped to me from New Jersey. It wasn't packed the way generally amazon packs stuff. It was packed in a flimsy paper bag which was taped around. I had ordered two DVDs. 1. Unexpected Journey and 2. Desolation of Samug.
The first DVD started skipping in first 20 minutes. I thought it was my XBOX 1 Blue ray player, so I switched to my LG blu ray player and it skipped there as well. After couple of hick ups within first first 30 minutes, the movie ran fine. After that, I opened DVD.2 and found out that the plastic hing that DVD holder clamps on to is broken. So when you open the DVD box, you should see several DVDs arrange in a book fashion with a hing that supports flipping DVD pages from one to another, mine was broken ( could it be the flimsy packing, I don't know). When I ran DVD.2 it ran fine. Overall I am not happy with the DVDs, again I love the movies but the review is not about the movie.

4630125,5,B0059XTU3G,"Last year, when the second Hobbit came to theaters, I couldn't wait to see it. We saw it right after Christmas when our Dad came to see us, and ate at Olive Garden afterward. It was worth it. The second Hobbit is the best movie of 2013 (maybe one of the best of all time), with the exception of a possible tie with Thor 2: The Dark World.
 I've never been a huge Lord of the Rings fan (although I do enjoy them a little), but I really like how the Hobbit movies have a tie in with the Lord of the Rings films, and The Hobbit films have become my favorite series of all time. The actors that Peter Jackson casted really make even the smallest characters seem important (except for Bifur), and it even included new characters, not in the book, and still helped move the story along with them too.
 Gandalf's story may not have been so in depth in the book, but in the appendixes of the third Lord of the Rings book, it does mention that Gandalf fought at Dol Guldur. I may have had an idea of how it was going to end before it came out, because I estimated how many chapters in the book each movie would cover, but that didn't make it any less awesome.
 The only thing in it that could have been better would be if they had included the theme music from the first film in it, but the rest of the music is great, and I can still hope it'll be in the third.
 Overall, it is five stars, and I hope that the third will be the same.",1416960000,,1425,4.042553191489362

Well the real problem is nobody after this is going to put a good version to film and fans of the actual story are going to be stuck with this garbage for the rest of our lives.

4630152,4,B0059XTU3G,"I remember when it was first announced that the series being split into 3 movies.  Originally there were two and even then, when you know how lite of a fare the book is, you wonder where all the content is coming from. Well, it's coming from the appendixes of course.  In both the first movie and this second one, I find one set of scenes that just drag longer than is needed or expected. It slows the movie and takes you out of the experience as you start to wonder - did they just film this for time.  The spiders was that scene for me. For the most part, the pacing in the movie isn't bad, but that series of scenes dragged it down.

The extended edition is where it is at and sets a standard for any movie set where special features are concerned. I feel the original Lord of the Rings movies were a bit better than the two Hobbit releases, but that still makes them 99% better than any other release out there.

Bottom line: I could see the extended editions being much for someone with no prior interest in the source material or little love for the fantasy genre.

Scenes that seemed a little rushed (particularly the scene with Smaug) here emerge with full power and grace.  The clarity of the dialogue and the dynamic range of the soundtrack is impressive.  Shore's music seems very good about setting moods, but it doesn't work well on a recording, where the music all sort of runs together - which is fine when there is a visual image with it.

4630178,5,B0059XTU3G,"I actually have the 5 disc Extended Edition and the Extended Edition on Prime. The addition minutes add a lot to the movie if you have not read the books and the appendices to the books. I love the changes and additions that Peter Jackson added to the original story (which started out as a children's book), and how he worked in some of the information from the appendices into these movies and LOTR. I can hardly wait to see The Battle of Five Armies. I do not agree with the ""purist groups""--you cannot make a movie like this (or LOTR) without added information either from knowledge of the author/appendices/ (which Peter Jackson and his writing crew do). The Hobbit book needed characterization above and beyond the children's book--which, as a book was a bit slow and well, made for child of that era (he was friends with C.S. Lewis--remember the names of his books?).
Smaug is probably the best dragon I have ever seen on screen--he is wonderfully evil and beautifully alive. From the moment he opened his eye--I fell in love with Smaug as the evil creature. So alive and ""smarey"" and wicked and--cool.
People need to get it through their heads that you cannot add everything in a book to a movie--99% of the time--it does NOT transfer very well. There were several characters and chapters that I loved in the book, but looking back, could never really come alive on the screen. And while great additions to the book, would have slowed down the movie to unbearable--Beuron is one of them, the riddles and beautiful poems--get a freakin' grip--- You have to pick and choose and I have had NO problem with the additions and the choices made by Peter Jackson and his crew to make it more interesting. I cannot think of a single movie in history that has been done-word for word, chapter for chapter----that is just ""dull non creative I need to be spoon fed"" thinking. Peter Jackson and his crew and actors have brought the Middle Earth alive--living.
I still have the original 1977 paperbacks that my parents got for me for my birthday. They are ragged with the re-reads.",1416614400,,2075,4.641304347826087

4630183,1,B0059XTU3G,"What makes The story of the Hobbit so great is it's beauty in simplicity. The story is pretty simple, but it has deep characters with great story telling, and interesting foes along the way. I was my favorite book growing up. Desolation of Smaug convolutions all that and ruins (arguably) some of the best parts of the book.
1) The added Orc guy chasing them... is stupid. It's not in the book and is TOTALLY unnecessary.  Due to shoving this character in the movie... it ruins the other storylines.

2) One of the funnest parts of The Hobbit is seeing the wisdom and trickery of Gandalf. The way he tricks Beorn to extend hospitality to his party is so awesome... but not in the movie. They do it totally wrong and stupid. It cheapens the character of Beorn.

3) The dialogue between Bilbo and Smaug was another GREAT part of the book that this movie totally takes a huge stinky Carl's Jr dump on (like after a Western Bacon cheeseburger and fries type dump). Bilbo NEVER went fully into the room with the dragon. He hid in a chamber and had excellent banter with Smaug. Smaug tried to lure him out and tried to roast him with fire... but Bilbo in the passage escaped. The movie goes over the top with Biblo out running a freaking dragon!! It's not
believable and cheesy and stupid.

So in closing... Dear Peter Jackson... your an idiot. If you want to make a movie about a book... write your own freaking book and then ruin that. You ruined a story that is almost un-ruinable... you figured out how to do it. 0 stars.",1416528000,3,1519,4.433691756272402

I was disappointed there were not more Mirkwood elf scenes, Tauriel in particular, she is an engaging and well-acted character and a fine addition to the film, but could have used more character buildup and development. (and they could have erased that stupid love triangle with some editting but no...) And they could have hardly gone wrong with giving us more Lee Pace as Thranduil.

The extras with Thrain were pointless and ruined the Dol Guldur scenes, I really didn't see the point of adding them except to give Thorin more angst and Gandalf a little extra to do. Same with the Laketown Master extras- he was disgusting enough in the theatrical release, thank you very much. Difference was that it was funny then, these extra scenes just make him downright cringeworthy. There were cut scenes in the appendices with the Bard kids that would have been better additions.

The AUJ EE added scenes that enhanced the story and cleared up slightly murky plotlines, and I heartily enjoyed it. Unfortunately PJ and crew failed to replicate their success here, and gave us mostly forgettable extras that slowed things down and border on taking away from the story, rather than make it even better.

I'm still adding it to my LOTR movies collection of course, but other than for the extra Beorn scenes, really only because I want a complete extended edition set. I'll be watching the theatrical release for rewatches in the future.",1416355200,2,1697,4.7815699658703075

Well because I am a 3d nerd I bought the 3d blu ray for the purpose of seeing if on a large tv the 3d would be better..it was not..if you take off your 3d glasses yes the screen becomes blurred, put them back on and it is in focus, but that is it..focus..not any worthwhile 3d experience at all anywhere in the movie. A 2d conversion to 3d TV would have done the same thing. I realize there are die-hard Hobbit fans and I am glad you like this movie..but realistically is it just bad.

4630238,5,B0059XTU3G,"Another great instalment from Peter Jackson.  Not perfect but outstanding never the less.  There are quite a few people who are critical of how PJ is putting the HOBBIT to film.  Everyone has their own opinions, likes and dislikes.... that is fine, but take those criticisms with a grain of salt as I seriously doubt even one of the reviewers who is critical could do 10% as good a job as PJ has done on the LOTR or the Hobbit films.  The second film has a bit more humour in it and some like that and some don't. The barrels going down the river was a comical event that some could do without but others like the humour in it.  As far a too much CGI in the film........ get real people!  It would be impossible to do this film without loads of CGI.  Orks, Goblins, Hobbits, Elves and flying Dragons seem to demand lots and lots of CGI.  The more action the more CGI.
  We just returned from the Hobbiton Movie Set in Matamata, NZ and I will tell you that the attention to detail is amazing.  PJ has an eye for detail and everything has to be just right.  It shows in his movies.
  The extra materials in the extended versions is almost better than the movie itself.  Seeing how they make the movie is a pure joy to watch.

4630244,5,B0059XTU3G,"I love both the books and the movie. The purists keep saying how much it differed from the books. If that's the case you must have hated Return of the king. Cutting out the entire Shire battle at the end. I have read all of them including the Silmarillion the only thing I kind of disagree with is Tauriel. I like her character, however it just seems like a lot of screen time for an added character who didn't even appear in the books. I usually am more of a purist about leaving something alone but I think that Peter Jackson did a superb job of telling his take on the story. Simple differences such as Bilbo keeping the ring on while talking with Smaug had to be done. Otherwise visually you have this dragon talking to thin air. The book can give descriptions of emotion with an invisible hero . Movies need the visual!",1416182400,,824,4.32258064516129
4630245,3,B0059XTU3G,"First, let me say that I LOVED LOTR, and I have all the extended versions. And, I was careful to not listen to reviews of this, since I wanted to go in unbiased and watch it pretty much objectively. I had no idea what to expect, so when I saw this on sale at Target (sorry, Amazon, I had a weak moment!) for $13, thought I'd take the jump. I even waited a week after I bought it so I could take my time and fully enjoy it.
Let's get to the positive parts first. This story is amazing, and the casting is perfect. The effects, while great, have their bad points, but overall, I'm glad I bought it and it will be part of my library for years to come. I sincerely believe Tolkien was ahead of his time, and this entire story, LOTR included, is now a part of our history that can never be forgotten. Amazing.
As for this particular movie, though, I would love to say is now a favorite of mine, but it's not. Its a great movie, great effects, and I loved the story, but let's be serious here....there are flaws that simply can't be overlooked. And, I'd also love to say that the over-all greatness of this movie is right up there with LOTR, but that would also not be true. For several reasons.
First, the effects are wonderful, and take you into the story like nothing else. Smaug (played by Benedict Cumberbatch, and who doesn't love him?!?!!??) is the greatest dragon EVER, and has a personality that's totally unequaled in villains of any and every kind. The rest of the cast is pretty great, but I found that the flaws and catches in the cinematography would throw me at different points, when I shouldn't have even been thinking about it. Like, when Legolas and Tariel are going after the Orcs.....Legolas looks like there's something wrong with his eyes. Not sure what's up with that, but it sure did capture my attention a couple of times, when I would have rather been watching what else was going on.
Also, for some unknown reason, the story lags in the middle. I found myself picking up my phone and checking it, and then coming back a couple minutes later and picking up on the story. ????? Again, not sure if that was done purposefully on Jackson's part, but I've never had that problem watching LOTR.
(and for those people who would say I'm comparing it, I'm not. This is a totally different story and setting, and has it's own merits that LOTR does not. However, if I'm going to watch a movie, any movie, lag time shouldn't be a problem.)
Second, the name of the movie is 'Desolation of Smaug'. Ok, so.....when does that happen?? Not sure why Jackson decided to change that to the next movie in the trilogy, but....really? We see Smaug flying away, and then.....there's no 'desolation'?  I'm not following Jackson's thinking here. He had originally, with LOTR, wanted to keep it true to the book, so not sure why he decided to forego that plan for this, but overall, I'd say that was a mistake.
Last, and I know this kind of doesn't make sense, but......there's not much to the storyline, you'd think I wouldn't have had a problem following it...right? Wrong. It's like...the storyline was there, but the editing made it hard to follow?? I know, maybe someone else can phrase it better.
My hope for this movie was huge, and I'm highly disappointed this didn't live up to what it could have been. I liked it, but didn't fall in love with it, which I'm really unhappy about. Sorry, Mr. Jackson, just being honest.",1416182400,,3421,4.4736

4630277,3,B0059XTU3G,"Extended Edition is not worth the money!!!  The Prancing Pony bar scene is expanded but serves no purpose other than to introduce to Thrain, Thorin's father.  The Beorn scene is expanded- we see him meeting the dwarves and chopping wood, again to no purpose.  Since at this time they had already decided to make three films instead of the original two,  we are getting just filler.  Where's the meat?  IMHO, the extended versions should add more meat, not filler.  Something that enhances the picture.  More Mirkwood filler.  Then we see Thrain again only for him to disappear in black smoke .  I have watched half (4&1/2 hrs) of the extras and to be honest, there was only 1 piece that I would have included in the film - the scene with Thranduil, the elfin king, on his tree throne when the captured dwarves are brought in to see him before being placed in their cells.  This scene actually advances the story and combined with one scene they included but did not complete might give us a clue about the white jewels Thranduil covets.  I will skip the original release of the last film, and just purchase the extended edition.  Peter Jackson did this crap with Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and this time I'll just skip the first release.  Makes me wonder if there will be a special extended edition!?!",1416009600,,1301,4.6

4630295,3,B0059XTU3G,"I was really hoping this would fix so many problems that I found with the theatrical release of Desolation of Smaug. Which, I'll admit was mostly enjoyable for me until the very  last segment of the film. I know you, Pete and Philippa, wanted to put this into a trilogy, but damnit, I had to refrain myself from yelling out loud ""GET TO LAKE TOWN ALREADY, SMAUG!""

If you are already invested in the Hobbit trilogy this far and only have the first entry, An Unexpected Journey, then you'll want to pick this one up. Sadly, yes, the extended edition is the one you want to buy because even the scenes that were not in the theatrical are worth it for owning. In fact one actually explains why no men wanted to help the dwarves left in Laketown after Thorin and company head towards the mountain. More scenes with Beorn are always welcome and it was nice to see this version of the Queer Lodgings chapter. But (huge but) This movie is now capped at 3 hours and 6 minutes and even some of the extended scenes were just not needed for obvious reasons. Look, we know Stephen Fry's character is a corrupt bastard, but do we really need to watch him eat disgustingly or know more about him? Do we really need to watch Bard's shenanigans on the Laketown authority? I was even yawning during the Mirkwood extended segments. I get it, the forest is cursed, but we shouldn't have to drag our feet on the path already. Please, move along!

Regardless, this is a must own for fans of LOTR and the Hobbit. As I complained about the extension of scenes, I enjoyed watching every making of documentary segment. All I can say is, LOTS OF DETAIL went into these movies. And I always appreciate it when production crews and directors put that much effort into films. If nothing else, buy this for the movie making tales and as always, New Zealand scenery.
Now if only we can get a director's cut that has less slog and to the point scenes. Let's hope this is the only Slog of the trilogy. Battle of Five Armies, let's get this trilogy concluded!",1415923200,,2025,4.438172043010753

4630297,4,B0059XTU3G,"I'll be honest, when I first read the title, my mind misread Smaug as Smegma. I purchased this thinking it was a urology documentary, but to my pleasant surprise, it was the second installment of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit. So what's so great about this movie? Well, for starters, I don't have to flip through 320 pages of pedantic, tedious text to learn about the exploits of Bilbo Baggins and company. I'm not kidding, you ever try reading Tokien? It puts me to sleep faster than any horse tranquilizer can. I know a lot of people were very angry that this movie wasn't true to the book, but honestly, it's really good. Even if you're a staunch, arrogant literature snob, just watch it for Sir Ian McKellen (the guy who played Magneto in X-Men) and of course, Martin Freeman.",1415923200,,777,4.597122302158273

4630324,3,B0059XTU3G,"Edit 11/14/14: this is a next day edit after being able to go through the film and the special features. The extended film is great; there are some scene that really give the film more depth. But the features are in actual fact ONE hour long feature about the creation and development of Smaug the dragon. And that's interesting but in no way what I thought I was paying for. If you want something that's easier to watch from wherever you are, you could buy this. But if you want all the  bonus features buy the DVD.

I took a chance and bought the instant video version. It is really annoying that all the reviews for the title are grouped together because I wanted to know how the format for instant video was going to be like with the bonus features. It is one long streaming video and you have to go through the extended version of the film in order to get to the extended features. Had I known that I don't know that I would have bought it, and for that reason I give it 3 stars. But at the price I paid it is still a pretty decent enough deal. I don't know if the bonus features are as extensive as the dvds or blurays, but they are likely to be a better investment because you can pick and choose what to watch when. I really wish Amazon would consider a different output method, kind of like they do with a TV show. You can buy the film but pick what to watch as a package. I don't understand why that would have been difficult to do.
 I love Tolkien's universe and am going to keep this in my video library... But I will likely still put the DVD on my Christmas list.",1415836800,2,1576,4.143790849673203

4630332,5,B0059XTU3G,"I love everything P. Jackson has done with Tolkien's work.  Yes, he added many things to this trilogy that were not in the book, but not as much as people think.  He did get a lot of material from the appendices.  I think the book purists don't realize that if the movie were adapted strictly from the book, it wouldn't be a very good movie.

Other than that, the price was great.  Amazon even refunded 4 cents because I pre-ordered with their lowest price guarantee, lol.  The two bonus material discs are fantastic.  They explain so much about everything that was involved with making this movie.  Those who complain about the story, too much CGI, etc. would get a lot of answers on why they did what they did in making it.  Besides that though, it's just really interesting stuff.

The extended scenes made a great movie, even better for me.  The scene where the Dwarves meet Beorn is almost identical to the book.  I can't think of why P. Jackson removed that scene instead of some other ones.  It also answers a lot of questions that are crucial to the story, for example, the scene with Thrain.

Where this really shines for me is the Appendices, the making of journey of The Desolation of Smaug. Watching the evolution of Smaug really reminded me of the evolution of Gollum. Like Andy Serkis did with Gollum, Benedict Cumberbatch shaped the character Smaug would become by fully embracing the role. It's incredibly fun to watch, and the whole ""magic of film"" laid out for you is such a wild ride.

4630370,4,B0059XTU3G,"You have to buy into two premises to like all of the Hobbit movies, and this one in particular: 1) Lots of action and orc fighting, which is not really in the book as much, 2) new characters in Hobbit and parts from other Tolkien books are included.

The Hobbit Trilogy is certainly a lot more violent that the book. It is scarier and absolutely unsuitable for children under 13. If you try to make a child enter the world of Middle Earth through these movies, you give it a great disservice. Start with the book when he/she is 10 and hold on the movies. They are not for kids. The book carries a lot more of the magic of Middle Earth.

Having said that, if you are a big fan of Tolkien and his works, are over 13, and are geek enough to know the books other than Hobbit and LOTR, you will find a lot here that is exciting to see and that is well put on the screen by the Peter Jackson team. The necromancer story, the side characters like Radagast and Beorn, as well as the extended time we spend in the Lake City are all getting more weight than in the book and add great color to the Middle Earth that is depicted here. New characters like Tauriel and the re-appearance of Legolas are fun, although not in the text. But they work and it is all good. There is lots of orc fighting, run and shoot style, which is exciting. I am still not sure what to think of the scenes involving Smaug. I guess, if you get a Benedict Cumberbatch to voice a dragon, you have to use him, but I don't remember any of that stuff from the book.

It is all very long, and especially in the Extended Version (25 extra minutes) it can drag out. Again, if you love the Hobbit and Tolkien - it could easily be even longer and you (like me) won't mind, even if they are deviating from the book as much as they do. If you are on the fence, don't get the extended version, it is too much.",1415577600,,1861,4.107142857142857

4630383,5,B0059XTU3G,"Full disclosure: I am a huge fan of both Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films and Prof. Tolkien's source material. The theatrical release of the first Hobbit film was very satisfying for me as I could see what Jackson was up to: the story of the dwarves, the hobbit, and a dragon dominating a stolen hoard of riches was the frame on which the larger tale of the return of Sauron was attached. I think Jackson was as interested in the material he was pulling from the LOTR appendices as he was in the text of The Hobbit. I'll offer no disagreement to folks who found the first film pokey and the Extended Edition (EE) pokier and largely a disappointment, when compared to how the original trilogy was enhanced and improved in their EE forms.

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was a more enjoyable theatrical experience than the first film in the trilogy and I have very high hopes for the third film. 'Smaug: EE' is a return to what we came to expect from the first trilogy's extended editions. While there are,a gain, several scenes that  have small extensions on them, there are also brand new scenes that add to the narrative--Beorn gives Gandalf intelligence on the Ringwraiths; the company is introduced to the dwarf-hating Beorn in a comic scene--and there are additions to the Mirkwood journey that alter what we saw theatrically. For me, the biggest change was the addition of Thorin's father, Thrain, in two sequences. He is an important addition to a sequence late in the film where Gandalf confronts the entity that is the proto-Sauron. His presence adds depth and emotion as Thrain, anticipating his end, asks Gandalf to give a message to Thorin that transcends fantasy and very much belongs to the world of fathers and sons.

The BD package includes nearly 10 hours of extras and a full-length commentary track by Peter Jackson and co-writer, Philippa Boyens. They are regulars on all the EE commentary tracks and are among the best in the business. They provide solid background on the production, interesting and funny anecdotes. Most of all, I got the sense that they were trying to explain--with regret--the comparatively paltry EE of An Unexpected Journey. The bottom line is that The Hobbit was planned as a pair of films until very late in the game. It was only a few months prior to production when the decision was made to create a second trilogy. This meant that several sequences that would have been candidates for inclusion in both the theatrical AND EE cuts of Hobbit 1 were held back to be included in Hobbit 2. This left mere scraps for the EE of the first film. Jackson and Boyens repeatedly refer to 'Smaug' as the third film in the trilogy, at least from the point of creation. The fact that it had such limited pre-production time and is so good is a tribute to Jackson and his team.

The appendices, Parts 9 & 10 in the continuity of the EEs, are chock full of goodies. If you have been a fan of past EEs, you will not be disappointed with this package. Once again, I came away wishing I could have been invited to New Zealand to be a part of of Jackson's company. It looks like hard work and SO MUCH FUN! Most of the segments of the Appendices run 20-30 minutes and can be devoured in small chunks, but I promise you will find yourself saying, ""Just one more,"" time and again. It's compulsively interesting stuff.

Lastly, the 'Special Edition' EEs come with a collectible. 'Smaug EE' includes a maquette of Thorin, Bilbo, and Kili (I think) from the barrel-riding sequence. It's a nice piece, with a detailed, full-color, paint job. This is an Amazon exclusive. Somewhere out in the world is another special edition that includes bookends of the giant statues of the dwarf guadians at the entrance of Erebor. I wish Amazon had obtained the rights to that set, too. It would make a nice complimentary set to the bookends that came with the 'Fellowship EE.' The set with the Erebor bookends seems to be rare. I haven't found any vendor that is stocking it. That said, Amazon's offering is a great deal at about $80. Truthfully, I'd like to have both. If you find the set with the collectible to be too pricey, the 5-disc BD set is avialable on its own and isa bargain, compared to what the original EE trilogy sold for some 10 years ago. Go get it and clear a weekend. Enjoy!",1415577600,3,4309,4.60546875

In practice that means registering one account after another, and it never works right. I can register my ""ultraviolet"" because the website I'm supposed to use doesn't answer. And that isn't the first time, not to mention how is anybody supposed to keep track of all the different accounts? And don't get me started on how you are supposed to play them. Are we all expected to have a full-blown desktop PC at our TVs?

This was included in the purchase. It's gotta work. It doesn't. And even if it did it isn't nearly as convenient as advertised.

In any case, the one included with this extended edition is with ""flixter"" and the website doesn't work.

UPDATE: as a result of registering my Hobbit movie I have now started to receive spam from Warner Brothers.

To add insult to injury it starts with ""This email was sent to you because you asked to receive updates and special offers from Warner Bros.""

No, I didn't.

UPDATE2: so I unsubscribed from all Warner Brothers spam.  I am still getting spammed.  Now I get ""Complimentary Movies to Jumpstart Your Digital Collection"".  Well, so first of all this is on complimentary when you sign up for X, Y and Z, so it is deceptive.  Second, I never subscribed to any email spam. Third, I also clicked the link to unsubscribe from everything.

I can really not recommend that anybody makes use of those digital ""download"" things included with this product. They aren't downloads and quite frankly they are garbage and just an annoying marketing tool.  What should happen is that you can watch the movies you bought in your Amazon prime account (just like you can for music you bought) or in your Netflix account, or any of the other things you already use. But this ultraviolet thing is very close to a scam and it certainly is spam.

UPDATE3: and now Universal is spamming me, with really unrelated nonsense, and to tip it off the Universal mail doesn't have a single unsubscribe link. At least your could get rid of the WB spam easier.

UPDATE4 (Dec 1): even more spam. It is outrageous. I am so disappointed that Amazon allows this kind of behavior.  Buying things on Amazon should not get you signed up with 3+ sorts of junkmail subscriptions for a single item you buy on Amazon.

UPDATE5 (Dec 12): on some of those spam email they have an unsubscribe link that says it works on their website but it doesn't stop the spam.  Next email I get I will report these jokers to the FTC.

UPDATE6 (Dec 26): and more spam, now with ""tips how to use your ultaviolet library"". The fact that I unsubscribed 5 times from UV communications means nothing to them. They keep inventing new spam and apparently I am pre opted in.

P.S. the extended version is even more boring than the theatrical one. At least for the first movie the extended version was better than the original. Here? No. Lake town particularly sucks.

Understand that I am usually not drawn to this type of sci-fi period piece as much as I have been to ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise.
The resolution on BLU-ray is engulfing and simply gorgeous. The journey to Hobbit land feels like it's own world. The fight and brutal war scenes are not at all gory because of Mr. Jackson's desire to stay away from unnecessary shock and awe.
The star of this franchise sequel remains the enigmatic Spiegel (Andy Serkis) Precious, etc. There are hints of his arrival as the gold surfaces early on during one of their adventure scenes. I have long felt that Andy Serkis at minimum deserves several Supporting Actor nominations. Serkis simply brings the character to life. If a fan anxiously awaits Spiegel's arrival admist all the fantastic action scenes, it is not just the fantastic effects that makes this character indispensable to the franchise.....it is Andy Serkis that makes Gollum real for me and others.

(To young to see scary Orcs and Smaug!)  Ok, I have all of the Extended LOTR movies, and Unexpected Journey - and I think this one is is the worst of all of them.  Don't get me wrong I still love the movie, but as far as extended scenes go, it didn't really do much aside from make me wonder why it was cut out in the first place.  If you like Beorn (who doesn't?) you will like the added scenes.  You get the scene from the novel where Gandalf has the dwarves come out in pairs as to not overwhelm the shapeshifter.  You hear him tell Gandalf about the Necromancer in Dul Guldur, and how the kings turned wraiths are gone from their tomb in the mountain.  These scenes give the original more clarity at to what is going on.  Really the new and extended scenes are in the beginning and a little in the middle, but from the time they go to the Misty Mountain and wake Smaug, there is nothing but what we've already seen.
I really wanted to see more extended/additional scenes with Smaug, Saruman, and the Orcs.  My favorite new/extended scenes were with Thrain, Thorin's dad.  He was referenced in the original cut, and I knew to expect his scenes in this addition.  He is under enchantment by the Necromancer, who attacks Gandalf while he looks around Dul Guldur (It is undoubtedly a trap...).  He breaks the enchantment and we learn he doesn't want Thorin to go to the mountain - why not?  I want to know more about this, but I know since it wasn't in the original cut, we won't see this story arch in the next theatrical movie on December 17th - I guess we'll have to wait for Battle of the Five Armies Extended Addition in another long year...

When you are done with the first viewing you will just be in shock thinking the movie is the worst thing ever.  The truth is it is the worst rendition of JRR Tolkiens Hobbit ever.  If you want to see a good Hobbit watch the cartoon.  I did notice that there is nothing on the Blu-ray package about JRR Tolkien so it was obvious that Jackson was not making Tolkien's books he was just making up a new story as he went along.

As far as the movie goes if you throw out the fact that this is supposed to be the Hobbit and just watch it for fantasy movie that you know nothing about it is very entertaining.  It is just not the Hobbit.  Jackson should be ashamed.

I removed 4 stars for not being the Hobbit (or anything close) and added back 2 for being an entertaining movie once you get by ""The Desolation of Tolkien"".",1415059200,,1067,4.111111111111111

""Desolation of Smaug"" wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either.  I enjoyed the movie up until Thorin and company were giving Smaug the run around at the end.  By then it was just too much action that just seemed to drag.

There were plenty of highlights, though.  Smaug was greatly done and the banter between him and Bilbo was entertaining.  The effects on Smaug was also well done and I have to say the CGI team did a great job in bringing the great dragon to life.  Of course, Benedict Cumberbatch did excellent voice work for the role, and his chemistry with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) only made the scene better.  Another highlight for me was Mirkwood.  Loved Thranduil and the presence he gave to the film.  I just wish those scenes were longer and didn't mostly concentrate on the romance between Fili and Tauriel.

For Tolkien purists who are looking for a retelling of the book, you'll notice some significant differences in the film.  If you're not bothered by that, however, the film is still enjoyable.",1413936000,,1183,4.576190476190476

My Godfather introduced me to Tolkien when I was 10.  I read everything written many times over and own most of it.  Loved the books and the movies for different reasons.

4630723,5,B0059XTU3G,"What can I say?  Peter Jackson has clearly made the works of J.R.R. Tolkien a priority in his personal and professional life and we are all better off for this.  He has focused not only on the central story of a band of dwarves who retake their stolen home from a despotic dragon, but he has also worked in some more humanizing events such as a love story between elves and dwarves, and the follies of isolating yourself from the rest of the world.  More experienced reviewers than I have examined the story of Bilbo Baggins in microscopic detail, so I won't go into Tolkien's use of metaphors related to his experiences in WWII, but the book is brilliant and so are the movies.  I eagerly await the debut of the last movie in this series in December, and I look forward to my sons' rapt interest as well.",1413244800,,805,4.382550335570469

4630729,5,B0059XTU3G,"The extended edition for The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug will contain 25 minutes of new scenes, in contrast with An Unexpected Journey's 13 minutes. It also has over 9 hours of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews, detailing the monumental task of bringing the incredible world of Middle Earth to the screen. Here is some stuff we'll see in the Extended Edition:

1. A LOT MORE OF DOL GULDUR. Specifically, we get to meet Thrain, Thorin's mad father. Gandalf meets with him and has a pointed discussion. The makeup and prosthetic effects for Thrain are just amazing. Wait till you see it. Richard Armitage also promises glimpses of a vast, bloody battle in Moria.

2. A LOT MORE OF MIRKWOOD. I was surprised and pleased to learn that two scenes from the book were actually filmed: Bilbo, Thorin and company crossing a slimy, enchanted river in Mirkwood. Contains some humor, some amazing sets, some amazing Martin Freeman acting, and a little bit of dark magic. Another sad scene contains a beautiful stag and Dwarvish target practice.

3. ENHANCED INTERROGATION: Beorn, in bear form, and an orc, in crying-for-my-mommy form (presumably). Mikael Persbrandt promised his first scene was a ""messy"" interrogation of an orc. More Beorn is always welcome. We might also see flashbacks of Beorn himself being tortured in Dol Guldur, back when Azog the Defiler exterminated the Skinchangers.

4. MORE OF BEORN'S HOUSE. And we know what that means: more of that glorious New Zealand landscape that we all love. All we know is that we see Beorn with big muscles and a bigger axe. We also get to see a whimsical scene ripped straight from Tolkien's pages, as Gandalf introduces the 13 dwarves and 1 hobbit in his care.

5. BEORN AND GANDALF. Beorn has a conversation with Gandalf about the dangers that lie ahead of the Company.

6. MORE THRANDUIL - SPECIAL FEATURES. Peter Jackson smiles upon us and gives us more Thranduil, including a conversation between father and son, and the dwarves, paraded in front of his mighty throne. Anticipate some elvish hubris and the bitemarks from Lee Pace's scenery-chewing. Note that the Thranduil scenes aren't in the Extended Edition, but in the Special Features. For more from that regal and bitter Elvenking, wait for Battle of the Five Armies.

7. MORE OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN. The Lonely Mountain gets less lonely as Bilbo and Company explore the ruins of Smaug's desolation - Dale. Some awesome cinematography I can't believe we missed!

8. STEPHEN FRY, SCENERY CHEWER. Stephen Fry promised us last year that he would eat testicles in The Hobbit. He fulfills that promise. At the very least, he shows what a scheming conniver he is, expressing his hopes that ""Old Smaug dines on dwarf for a day or two..."" Poor Master of Laketown...

9. MORE EVIL ORC ARMIES. Honestly, who doesn't want to see more shots of an orc army marching to doom and a red dawn? Even if its just two or three shots, this filled me with sheer awe!

10. ""THE WORLD OF MEN"". Most of Laketown was a stunningly detailed set built for real, and we get to see more of the workings and tradings and the men that live there, through the eyes of a hobbit very far from home... Including a new chase scene never before seen. We also see the orcs attack the men of Laketown.

Bilbo Baggins story will conclude with The Battle of Five Armies, but until then, the roads go ever on and on. Naamarie, mellon!",1413072000,65,3403,4.760611205432937

Yes the acting was OK, the soundtrack was OK but not inspiring, just like the cinematography.  There are scenes that look like they were shot by a kid on a bicycle with a handheld camera.

Elves (Legs and Tauriel shouldn't even be there) can do such amazing, supernatural fighting moves it becomes a joke to watch. A visually and audibly grueling, one-hour long encounter w/Smaug wherein main characters jump  and duck the dragon over and over when Smaug, an ancient and wise being, could've easily smoked all of them in seconds. After the LOTR trilogy The Hobbit just seemed like an unneeded series that probably should have waited longer, had a new director and a new film location. I think Hollywood should've put The Hobbit out first, as is chronologically correct, because the series is so much like watching a football game well after one team has a huge lead over the other and there's no reason to watch anymore.",1412726400,,904,4.908496732026144

There's practically no faulting Peter Jackson and co. in their cinematic vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's prelude to ""The Lord of the Rings"" excepting how he is lengthening the book into three films.  It made sense to do so with TLOTR given the breadth and scope of that story but if ""The Hobbit"" could be spun into an hour-and-a-half cartoon 20 plus years ago why does it need three two-and-a-half hour plus movies now in live action format?  The acting's great, the special effects are whizzers, and the story is as exciting as it can get but aye yi yi the pacing begins to hurt this trilogy and their decision to cut the movie off where they did leaves you wanting more, for sure, but it also vexes you sensing that the end of the story is seemingly so close at hand.

Maybe I'll feel differently about this fun romp of a middle-earthen adventure by the conclusion of the filmic trilogy but dang it all I'm docking this movie a full star for leaving the viewer with that incomplete feeling it leaves us with.",1411862400,,1095,4.482412060301508

4630898,5,B0059XTU3G,"I don't have the extended edition yet since it's yet to be released, but seeing that the haters were out in force I thought I should show it some love.

What most of the haters don't seem to understand is that there are 3 distinct versions of Middle-Earth. There is the version that Tolkien wrote, The version that you imagined when you read it, And the version Peter Jackson imagined and put to the screen. Perhaps most tragically a lot of these haters seem to only see thier own opinion as valid and often assume people who like the new hobbit movies never read the book.

I have The Hobbit, The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The Silmarillion, The Children Of Hurin, The Shaping of Middle Earth, The Book Of Lost Tales, etc. I also have The extended versions of The Lord of The Rings films and the first Hobbit. I Love all of them. If you don't like a piece of art, be it book, music, game, show, cinema or whatever you are certainly entitled to your opinion. I just wish people would spend more time enjoying what they like instead of hating on what they don't.

In my opinion Peter Jackson brought Middle Earth to life on the big screen in a way most people thought was impossible. I couldn't have realistically asked for a better set of films portraying my favorite fantasy world, even though there were scenes that differed from what I thought they should be. I'm looking forward to seeing his definitive take on this part of the story with the extended edition, and even more so on seeing his vision for the final part in theaters this december.",1411603200,202,1549,4.447183098591549

4630903,3,B0059XTU3G,"Got to hand it to Peter Jackson.  This guy can definitely create story.  A case in point:  THE HOBBIT:  THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.  This is a 3-hour visual feast of a story basically pulled from Jackson's creative posterior.  You won't find much of this second Hobbit installment in the pages of the children's book; you certainly won't find an Elvish woman named Tauriel, and you definitely won't find any hint of a budding romance between Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the young (and much, much shorter) Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner).  In fact, I give it up to Jackson; once the third installment is released later this year, he will have created nine hours of cinema. . .out of a 275-page book.  Improvisation, anyone?

Far darker than its Hobbit predecessor, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG depicts the dwarves' journey through creepy Mirkwood, to being smuggled into the remnants of Dale by a reluctant Bard (Luke Evans), to the dwarves finding the magic door into Erebor, ultimately to confronting evil Smaug (a glorified cartoon character).  The story, in fine Jackson fashion, moves along swiftly; there's lots of action and sword yielding and arrow shooting.  And we face two cliff hangers:  the unknown fate of Gandalf (Ian McKellen just gets better and better) at the hand (eye?) of Sauron in Dol Guldur; and Smaug flying away from Erebor to wreak an unknown quantity of havoc on Dale.  As always, the visuals and effects are stunning--if not creatively ad libbed.

Once again, Martin Freeman is masterful as Bilbo; Richard Armitage kingly as Thorin; and we're even treated to an appearance by Orlando Bloom as Legolas.  (And while Bloom looks much older playing the arrow-shooting Elf, we're supposed to keep in mind the Hobbit story occurs some 60 years prior to 'Lord of the Rings'.)  It's a fun, fast-moving film, even though Tolkien himself would fail to recognize the embellishment that is THE HOBBIT:  THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.

4630906,5,B0059XTU3G,"The extended edition for The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug will contain 25 minutes of new scenes, in contrast with An Unexpected Journey's 13 minutes. It also has over 9 hours of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews, detailing the monumental task of bringing the incredible world of Middle Earth to the screen. Here is some stuff we'll see in the Extended Edition:

1. A LOT MORE OF DOL GULDUR. Specifically, we get to meet Thrain, Thorin's mad father. A sad twisted wreck of a dwarf, he reveals dark truths about the Necromancer (and hey, great performance!). The makeup and prosthetic effects for Thrain are just amazing. Wait till you see it. Richard Armitage also promises glimpses of a vast, bloody battle in Moria.

2. A LOT MORE OF MIRKWOOD. I was surprised and pleased to learn that two scenes from the book were actually filmed: Bilbo, Thorin and company crossing a slimy, enchanted river in Mirkwood. Contains some humor, some amazing sets, some amazing Martin Freeman acting, and a little bit of dark magic. Another sad scene contains a beautiful stag and Dwarvish target practice.

3. MORE OF BEORN'S HOUSE. And we know what that means: more of that glorious New Zealand landscape that we all love. All we know is that we see Beorn with big muscles and a bigger axe. We also get to see a whimsical scene ripped straight from Tolkien's pages, as Gandalf introduces the 13 dwarves and 1 hobbit in his care.

4. BEORN AND GANDALF. Beorn has a conversation with Gandalf about the dangers that lie ahead of the Company.

5. MORE THRANDUIL - SPECIAL FEATURES. Peter Jackson smiles upon us and gives us more Thranduil, including a conversation between father and son, and the dwarves, paraded in front of his mighty throne. Anticipate some elvish hubris and the bitemarks from Lee Pace's scenery-chewing. Note that the Thranduil scenes aren't in the Extended Edition, but in the Special Features. For more from that regal and bitter Elvenking, wait for Battle of the Five Armies.

6. MORE OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN. The Lonely Mountain gets less lonely as Bilbo and Company explore the ruins of Smaug's desolation - Dale. Some awesome cinematography I can't believe we missed!

7. STEPHEN FRY, SCENERY CHEWER. Stephen Fry promised us last year that he would eat testicles in The Hobbit. He fulfills that promise. At the very least, he shows what a scheming conniver he is, expressing his hopes that ""Old Smaug dines on dwarf for a day or two..."" Poor Master of Laketown...

8. MORE EVIL ORC ARMIES. Honestly, who doesn't want to see more shots of an orc army marching to doom and a red dawn? Even if its just two or three shots, this filled me with sheer awe!

9. ""THE WORLD OF MEN"". Most of Laketown was a stunningly detailed set built for real, and we get to see more of the workings and tradings and the men that live there, through the eyes of a hobbit very far from home... Including a new chase scene never before seen! We also see the orcs attack the men of Laketown.",1411516800,695,2978,4.689655172413793

I didn't think Peter Jackson could sink below the plot blunders in the previous ""The Hobbit,"" unfortunately, in the service of cranking out a film trilogy from the original slim 400-page book, Mr. Jackson has committed an act of cynical butchery. This movie is full of bombast and irrationality, and a disaster from start to finish, bearing only the tiniest semblance to the book and employing gaseous overwriting and overacting, particularly from Evangeline Lilly and Orlando Bloom, but certainly not limited to them. Jackson does none of his actors any favors in this movie, and relies on Weta Digital effects to paper over the obvious money grab he commits in the production and direction of this disastrous tripe. There's no integrity and no art in this movie. Tolkien must be spinning in his grave. I defy anyone of any intelligence not to burst into laughter watching Evangeline Lilly perform her hysterical feat of healing using the Athelas herb.

I did not mind the additions because I did not believe they detracted from the story. That is not the case for the second movie. The additions are unnecessary and do detract from the story. The forest scene, especially the part with the spiders, is a key element to Bilbo as a character. It is the first time where he, on his own, saves the company. This part of the story is cut way too short and does not develop Bilbo as it should. Instead a ridiculous fight scene on the river is added. Also, the extra action scenes at the lake, and in the mountain, drag on way too much. Cutting some of the video game-like action sequences and spending more time with the real story would have made it better, and shorter. I did think the scenes of Gandalf fighting the Necromancer, and the way they presented Smaug were very good.",1411171200,,988,4.375

4630987,4,B0059XTU3G,"***This review may contain spoilers***
 Despite Hobbit purists frenzied accusation of director Peter Jacksons Hobbit movie trilogys lack of stringent, precise loyalty to the source material, I believe such loyalty is unrealistic.  No movie can exactly duplicate a novels characteristics; if it attempts to do so, it becomes ponderous, sluggish and dull.

  Take for example the scene near the beginning of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (hereafter Hobbit:DOS) where Bilbo, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the dwarves encounter the ursine, muscular shapeshifter Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) at his pastoral home.  If  Hobbit:DOS  had copied the Beorn episode exactly from the novel, it would have become mired in redundant exposition, since Gandalf relates to Beorn the adventures he and his followers have already endured in order to enlist the surly loners aid in their quest.  Instead, Hobbit: DOS makes the Beorn sequence more economically streamlined and actually more meaningful. Although Beorn is no fan of dwarves (which is why he angrily pursues them in his bear form), he decides to help them because they oppose the orcs and their confederates.  Beorn hates orcs and their company even more, since they have decimated and enslaved Beorns bear bretheren in the past (he waves a brawny, shackled arm as proof).  Though some may complain that the admittedly fiercely charismatic and bada$$ Beorn gets truncated, limited screen time, Hobbit: DOS manages, I think, to capture the sequences intent in the novel, and even embellish and extend it to the imminent, encompassing evil of the Necromancer and his legions.

  Throughout the  novels notable set-pieces - From Beorn , through Bilbo and the dwarves enchanted, perilous wanderings through the aptly named Mirkwood, through their battle with huge, voracious spiders, through their imprisonment in the Elvish citadel, through their gymnastically stunning and suspenseful escape from the citadel in floating barrels, to their initially furtive and demeaning but ultimately triumphant arrival in Laketown, to their journey to the Lonely Mountain to try to wrest the dwarves homeland from the unforgettable dragon Smaug  through all this, Hobbit:DOS continues to preserve each sequences basic purpose and meaning in the novel despite some tweakings and deviations.  Most of the deviations originate from implacable orc Azog the Defilers (Manu Bennett) Ahab-like dogged pursuit of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) for causing his deformity, and from the elves (namely Terminator-like warriors Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) enhanced presence and intercession in the dwarves quests.  Except for what I felt was a gratuitous, inexplicable (if still affecting), growing relationship between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner),  these deviations and detours do not detract from Hobbit:DOSs deliberate but fluid, action-packed, and genuinely exciting and involving interpretation.  Indeed, I felt the deviations emphasized the Hobbit novels indirect reference  to the looming threat of the Necromancer and its understated insistence that it is the duty of ALL Middle-Earth denizens (including the isolationist elves represented by Elvenking Thranduil) to face this pervasive evil.

  Therefore, Jacksons Hobbit:DOS does have epic objectives above and beyond the dwarves quest.  But again, I strongly disagree with the purists and other naysayers who argue that Hobbit:DOS gives short shrift to Bilbo, Thorin, and his band.  Even though his transition from reluctant bourgeois homebody to committed adventurer, inspiration to the dwarves, and even defender seems more abrupt in the movie, Bilbo (Martin Freeman) nevertheless makes his conversion convincing.  As in the novel, Bilbo proves his worth and value to the group and even (horrors!) faces the beguiling, mellifluous, but monstrous and seemingly invincible dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) even without his ring of invisibility.  He even persuades the dwarves, who fearfully do not encounter Smaug in the novel, to show their true legendary courage and confront the dragon in their stolen lair  which I actually think is a logical, plausible improvement.

  The Hobbit novel touches upon themes of courage, self-reliance, greed, and the duty to resist evil in all its myriad forms.  The Hobbit:DOS reflects these themes in its somewhat divergent, wildly dynamic and entertaining but still respectful cinematic presentation of Tolkiens vision and depiction of (as Balin (Ken Stott) would agree) that most remarkably daring and observant fellow Bilbo.  4.5 stars.",1410912000,48,4604,5.6438953488372094

While that can be an issue for me, I am satisfied with how the story is told - I see it as the same story, but more from the point of view of the dwarves, the principal characters in this part of the saga anyway.  It works for me.  I'm less certain that it was necessary to break the story into here parts.  I would rather have seen LOTR be four parts and this story be in two parts; but I acknowledge that I am just back-seat driving at this point.  So all in all, this is a good effort with a great story.  I am grateful for the fine work put in at all levels (direction, acting, production values), and I eagerly await the final installment of this trilogy.",1410566400,,755,4.1020408163265305

4631081,4,B0059XTU3G,"Obviously I haven't received this item yet, as it is pre-ordered for the release.
But here are some observation I made.

There are actually two Collector's box sets. The regular one, and the Amazon exclusive.

The regular Collector's box set, contains the two book holder style statues along with the Blu-Ray. These look awesome, but there was ONE detail that had me alarmed - the Blu-Ray in the regular Collector's edition version does NOT seem to come with book-like sleeve that ""An Unexpected Journey"" came with. This would look horrible in my shelf.

The Amazon version DOES include the sleeve. The weird thing is, the Amazon Exclusive set didn't come up in my search results on Amazon. I had to go through Steelbookbluray.com, which has the link leading back to Amazon.com, in order to find it.

More over, the statues are different in the two sets. The regular Collector's set, as mentioned, contains the Erebor dwarf statue book holders. The Amazon Exclusive box contains a different statue capturing a scene from the movie on an oval base, mush like the statue in the ""An Unexpected Journey"" Collector's box set.

All in all, I decided to pre-order the Amazon Exclusive set, because of the sleeve (all the Blue-Rays in the trilogy HAS to match, come on now!), and because the statue that comes with it also matches the previous one with Gollum and Bilbo. I'm really bummed that I won't get the book holder statues, but well I'm not that zealous of a completionist.

However, I must say, I severely despise this type of underhanded marketing, because it's a slap in the face to themost devoted fans. It kinda defeats the purpose of a Collector's box set. There should be ONE ultimate version for the fans who wanna have it all. Not two!

So, 4 stars for an awesome movie and a beautiful Collector's set that I know I'm gonna cherish.
1 star for underhanded marketing scheme. FU Warner Bros, and FU Amazon!",1410048000,57,1912,4.740963855421687

It isn't true to the book.  Okay, no big deal, this is about entertainment.  Was I entertained?  ABSOLUTELY!!!  The movie was a blast.

There were a few times when too much CGI had been used.  The barrel trip down the waterway was one in particular.  There seemed to be a lot of issues there.  However, being back to the thought of entertainment, it is highly doubtful any person seeing this film for the first, second or even third time would not be entertained.

Without giving spoilers, there are parts of this movie which aren't in the book which are integral to the story itself. Essentially, they eviscerated the plot and stuffed the equivalent of straw in there. Tauriel never needed to be in this movie. The Hobbit was never meant to be a romance. It is an adventure with trolls, and dragons and gold and thievery. I was hoping for another epic journey, but I came away disappointed. I'm actually kind of rooting for Smaug now.

4631087,1,B0059XTU3G,"Just horrible, even simply as a motion picture on it's own, it shows none of the care and fine work which we saw in The Fellowship of the Ring, a movie which I love.

It looks like a cheaply thrown together movie, terrible dialouge (since they didn't remotely stick to the tone, dialouge, and story of the Hobbit)-it's just infuriating.

Looked like a video game. Maybe they had a bad editor, but it's beyond me how anyone can say this is even a well made film.

I have read and re-read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, and I like the first and third installments of the Lord of the Rings. However, THIS is a MONSTROSITY, clearly made in order to make money and bring in a 'wider' audience by way of violence, meaningless plot and diolouge.

The original Hobbit is playful, whimsical, and meant to be a 'children's' story.

I don't know WHAT they were thinking focusing on everyone and everything BUT Bilbo Baggins. Geeze, Tolkien is turning over in his grave at this moment.

Badly edited, not carefully done. Oftentimes they don't even give us closeups of people who are talking, just a wide shot as the dialouge reads over it. I thought I might be watching a foriegn film dubbed over at some points.

Too bad....I thought the Fellowship of the Ring was fantastic. This is just sloppy, messy work, designed to make money.

4631101,4,B0059XTU3G,"I have been a J RR TOLKIEN Fan for many years and enjoyed the LOTR very much even with its flaws.  Like the LOTR, here the
photography is tremendous, the effects outstanding, the cast well selected and the story pretty much follows the books.  This review
will encompass the first Hobbit movie as well because any critical remarks will apply to both.  Peter Jackson is an excellent director
and knows how to get pretty good acting results from his relatively unknown actors (for me anyhow).  That is a problem for George
Lucas who is a fine story writer and visual director but leaves a lot to getting good performances from his cast.  I am thinking only of
the Star Wars movies which I enjoyed much, but squirmed at times at the mediocre performances of the cast.  Perhaps for those
films acting wasn't crucial;  I did like the acting in other Lucas films such as  the Indiana Jones movies. etc.  Anyhow, here in the
Hobbit stories I have no complaints.  If you like J R R books then you should love these interpretations of his stories.  My only bitch
is that Jackson has a tendency to engage in overkill; he adds to much to the stories that while are interesting, distract from the
primary story line.  He did this in LOTR and well as KING KONG. a good remake but much too long.  Still, I cant get enough of good fantasy stories that also are believable and has dark parts.  These Hobbit films have some  good creepy parts and that makes me as happy as Obama fund raising (or golfing!). I wish Warner Bros would release the extended versions earlier and
stop keeping us waiting forever.  I also would like to see a version of the SILLMARILLION made (for TV, its much too long for
a theater) but that is not likely.  Still, this film has lots of good action, incredible sets (Village of Dale for one) and lots of evil
Orcs.  Gollum of course is there and Frodo makes a brief appearance if the first film (not in the book) but it works well in the movie.
""In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit..."" my favorite line opening in any fantasy tale.  I got this like all my stuff from AMAZON, and no Dr Sweets or Martha the Moocher!  Enjoy these motion pictures but have patience because they are QUITE
long.  Excellent entertainment but only 4 stars because of the lengths.  I think the HOBBIT could have been done in TWO movies.",1409961600,2,2332,4.437647058823529

But the brilliance of those first two Lords was the way Jackson, his cast and crew made Tolkien's world real, solid and utterly believable. It was the *lack* of CGI as much as anything that made them so good.

4631188,1,B0059XTU3G,Peter Jackson makes little if any attempt to keep to original story in tact.  The only thing I was happy to see was that it was a little less cartoony than the first movie.  The first movie was so silly it actually seemed more like a cartoon than the animated movie from the 70's.  The effects were so painfully CG it ripped me right out of the story and dwarves were done so cheesy they belong in an 80s morning cartoon.  I am a huge fan of the books and even though I was disappointed with LOTR it was at least still watchable.  This entire attempt at the hobbit has been so awful I could only get through it with friends around to make fun of it MST3K style.  This is by far better than the first hobbit movie but still so far off the mark it hardly registers as Tolkien at all.,1409443200,,781,4.071895424836601
4631189,5,B0059XTU3G,Awesome,1409443200,,7,7.0
4631190,1,B0059XTU3G,"I actually didn't make it through the whole movie, the first time I saw it on cable; I didn't even see Smaug.  Couldn't stand it.  Later I did catch the rest of it.  Why watch it at all?  Well, you know the effects are going to be great, and you can hope against hope that it's going to be ""The Hobbit"".  (It ain't).

I have read some other reviews, and discussions, and one theme that's pretty much ubiquitous is that if you don't like these Hobbit movies, you're a ""purist"".  I think it's kind of like, if you don't buy the CNN view of world events, you're a ""conspiracy theorist""; call someone a purist or a conspiracy theorist and you've disqualified them from the discussion, without having to deal with any good, or troublesome,  points they may have made.

Look, you can have an adaptation, remake, or ""reimagining"" that takes the original in a very different direction, and still have artistic integrity.  The reimagined ""Battlestar Galactica"" was a completely different animal than the original from the 80's, and it was infinitely better.
Some of the movies based on Philip K Dick stories such as Blade Runner and Total Recall, are pretty good, though only tangentially related to the original.  The True Blood TV series was great, but has little to do with the original novels; on the other hand, ""Game of Thrones"" is equally great, and very faithful to the original.  It's not about being a ""purist""; that totally misses the point.  It's about taste, and it's about having some respect for  a beloved, iconic original.

One thing that seems to be true is that people who like the novel ""The Hobbit"" tend not to like these films as much as those who haven't read it.  Defenders of the movies interpret that as snobbery or ""purism"".  No, look, it's only natural.  People who like dumb Hollywood action movies with lots of special effects, and people who read fantasy novels, are different groups, though of course there is some overlap.  And frankly, yes: people who read fantasy novels, and like ""The Hobbit"", tend to have discriminating tastes; people who like dumb Hollywood movies with great effects, not so much.  There's such a thing as snobbery, and there's also such a thing as just not having any taste :-|
---or any respect.

And, of course, these movies make me angry, while I don't care about, and wouldn't even watch, say, Sharknado.  If you just want to make a dumb action movie, do that; you don't need to mess up a great story like ""The Hobbit'.  Plenty of video games to steal a plot from.
(and btw, I thought the LOTR movies were OK.  Great effects, not too bad in terms of ""gutting the original"", and the heavy-handnesses was not inapporopriate there. The first Hobbit movie, ""Unexpected Journey"", was terrible, but ""Smaug"" is much, much worse).

So, OK, the Hobbit novel was for kids, and this ain't; and ""LOTR"" wasn't yet thought of.  Here, you have something that's not for kids, that's a ""prequel"" of the LOTR movies, so it's aimed at that audience and they'll have those expectations.  It's intentionally dark and scary.  I get that, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that.  But the Hobbit novel is on a relatively small scale, and it's a very well constructed, elegant story, with a leisurely pace.  I had assumed that Jackson dragged the Hobbit out for three films just to make more money out of it, but now I see that that's not true at all.  You could take your time with the Hobbit, not add any of your own stupid, extraneous Hollywood plot gimmicks, and still have three movies.  Jackson throws in all this idiotic stuff of his own, such as the romance between Tauriel and Kili (!) for an egregious example, or the dwarves gold-plating Smaug (!!), but he rushes through everything.
Even if you never heard of the novel, or don't care about it, the insane, frenetic pace of this movie doesn't work.  You're supposed to be more awed and horrified and frightened with every second, for three hours or however long this thing lasts.  (There are brief moments of comic relief, but they're just so stupid!  Dick jokes?  Really?  Why not fart jokes? Well, in fact there is an outhouse joke, but like everything else, it doesn't work because it's so rushed).

And then you have these scary monsters, and they're really pretty scary, especially the spiders-- but why do the orcs have to be in every scene????  In the original, you get past the trolls, then the goblins, then you get by the Wargs, then the spiders, then the Elves, then you confront the dragon, and finally you have the climactic  Battle of Five Armies, where the Orcs (goblins) and Wargs show up again.  Here, you have this utterly stupid, stupid, ridiculous, nonsensical running battle with Orcs and Elves and Dwarves, messing up what otherwise might have been a good adaptation of the Barrelrider scene.  The Hobbit is NOT about being pursued by Orcs through the whole story.  It's one thing after another, till you reach the grand climax at the end; not orcs, orcs, orcs again, more orcs, still more orcs, lobster croquettes, and orcs!

--I was just thinking about, for example, the spider scene and how Bilbo gets wrapped up like everyone else, totally different from the book, but he's the only one able to cut himself free.  It makes no sense at all, whereas the original makes perfect sense--Bilbo defeats the spiders using invisibility, cleverness, and a little luck; not by being Conan the Barbarian!  I think this is why people who love the book (many of us) can't stand the movie.  It's not that we worship the way it was in the book and can't tolerate any change; it's just that we know how the scene can be done in a way that works, and makes sense.  If the changes worked, if they made any sense, that would be different.  This way, we keep getting reminded of how much better it was done in the original.  Jackson has this strange concept of faithfulness to the original where he includes or refers to nearly every scene, but changes each one for no reason, invariably doing it worse than the original.

 I think the guy who plays Bilbo does a good job, and I have no complaints about Evangeline Lilly (only about her character, who exists only to fall in love, with Kili, of all people).  I love her; it was great to see her, at the same time the existence of her character is yet another outrage.  Stephen Fry is totally wasted, but certainly that was a great casting decision; there just isn't time for him to develop anything.  I don't blame the actors; it's the script, and the direction.
But my point about these scary monsters is that they really are pretty scary, but everyone, even Bilbo, can take on dozens of them, cut swaths through them, and never get hurt.  How am I supposed to stay scared for three hours of monsters that clearly pose no actual danger?

Actually, you know, there's not many good movies anymore.  There IS good television, or good HBO at least-- GOT, Sopranos, True Blood, True Crime, etc.  I actually think the Hobbit could make a good TV  miniseries.  If you're going to make it dark, and not for little kids, why not go full HBO with sex and nudity?  Well, maybe not for the Hobbit; that would be including something completely extraneous, exactly what I'm complaining about with Jackson.  Still, I'd love to see The Hobbit done by the same people who do GOT.

Well, I guess that's all I have to say.  This movie is even worse than the last one.  It's almost as if he's deliberately trying to make the worst movie he can, with the best effects.  It really makes me angry.",1409443200,5,7533,4.618510158013544

It bears virtually no relation to the book, however. It ignores, twists, or destroys the real story, eradicating all its whimsy and charm and replacing it with pure testosterone. The whole basis with Beorn is twisted all around- gone is the charming introduction of the dwarves gradually, with Gandalf telling their story to Beorn in his house, with all the amusing insights into human nature it really provides. The story with the great spiders is altered beyond comprehension, and all kinds of material which are not in any Tolkien source whatsoever are introduced to put in mindless love story material and give screen time to Orlando Bloom. The straightforward story about Bard is turned into something it isn't, the hate story between Azog (who in the Tolkien canon is already dead) and Thorin is made silly, the story with Smaug is contorted to allow a great deal of special effects time for items not at all there, and on and on. As a telling of The Hobbit, this movie is absolute trash. One can hardly wait to see what kind of butchery job is done on Thorin's final speech while dying, if it even shows up at all.

4631283,3,B0059XTU3G,"Middle Earth returns front and center in this second chapter of the Hobbit trilogy, but it is not the same world.

For this installment, and the previous, Peter Jackson chose to rely heavily on C.G.I. effects to cut production time and create a world which required less attention to cinematic detail. In the commentary for the first film Jackson goes as far as to admit that he should have spent more time in pre-production, but felt too ""old and tired"" and wanted to finish this project as soon as possible (also, he wasn't originally intended to be the director, Guillermo del Toro was supposed to), thus leaving his fans with a hastily thrown together money trap that is more animated than the 1978 Lord of the Rings cartoon movies.

Out of Tolkien's novels this is by far my favorite. I wholeheartedly understand that a direct adaptation from the pages of the book would have been terribly boring (there are some things books can do that movies cannot pull off, and vice versa), however, this movie almost completely takes away all of Bilbo's credit during the adventure. The dwarves in the book were essentially useless moochers, who only regain their lost kingdom through Bilbo's resourceful character archetype. Yet on film they are lighthearted and chivalrous, which may aid in drawing in a younger audience, but ultimately takes away from the atmosphere, since the Hobbit originally incorporated a younger tone than the LOTR books anyways, yet retained a sort of gritty backdrop.

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug sacrificed costume sets and filming on location or in a a studio for some idiots sitting behind computer screens drawing pictures. It is painfully obvious how bad it looks (compare how bad the CGI white orc looks to the amazing make-up of the Uruk Hai who kills Boromir in the first LOTR film), and Peter Jackson does not care.

One final note, Legolas' part in the story is fabricated filth, and the Splash Mountain ""ripoff"" scene was the most abhorred sequence in the Hobbit trilogy to date.",1408924800,4,2020,4.880466472303207

While the Lord of the Ring series had tense moments and true character struggles among the companions, the Hobbit is just the same group running from orcs/elves/spiders/dragons.  The group seems helpless and bumbling and yet through serendipity always defeats everything in their path, normally through helpless and bumbling methods.  Even for a fictional story, it wears thin.

I found myself pausing at one point hoping it was nearing the end only to find it had another hour left.

If you are a Tolkein purist, you will probably be unhappy but I don't mix up the book and the movie.  Jackson got the important scenes in and Bilbo is showing an increasing maturity.

The film is released, but it's not the lovely one with all the extras and bits that didn't make the theatrical cut.  Peter Jackson released all of the LOTR films like that and I basically had to dance in place until the huge wonderful slipcased ones were released.  They have a place of pride in my DVD wall and I've watched them one after another every year and still enjoy them.

I just don't know WHEN to purchase the DVD (now in BluRay) long cut of the HOBBIT.  It's a wonderful film, can't complain about anything except about this.  Not even the unauthorized additions PJ has put in because they are wonderful to behold.

Maybe they shouldn't have made three movies out of one story - I love this story, and have read them all plus the Silmarillian 28 times! The action started being like a video game. Hey, movie makers - some of us, many of us, don't play video games and still enjoy the ART with the CHARACTER aspect. Smaug's stomping around and the near misses of life and limb made me pretty mad at times. The most thrilling parts of movies leave something for the viewer's imagination to interact with: there was a definite desperate sort of desperation to entertain. Stop that. The first one was good.

So many bits of the first film that people disliked could have been elimated in favor of scenes in this film's first thirty minutes that they raced over. This would have freed them to spend just a bit more time in mirkwood and laketown. However I have always believed this should have been a trilogy. I just feel this whole enterprise would have been better served by taking thirty minutes out of the first film and making the third film be about the five armies, the first being ending with their capture by the elves, and the second being about the white council. These are just my views. But, I still enjoyed this film. It has moments were its as good as Fellowship.",1408492800,,779,4.492957746478873

It seems like you are always left hanging an it takes forever for the next one to come out so you have to watch them over to keep track. Story line is good and picks up where it left off real well. Also, dumps you the same way. It is like a super long movie they cut to a commercial and instead of coming back its another movie. Like the new characters. Kinda think I know where they are heading with what will happen to them however. Dragon is cool. Doesn't make sense how it got in the mountain? And how it manages to stay in there all this time without coming out? According to he town people it as not been out since it went in. What did it eat all this time? The castle was completely intact inside until they come back in? How is that possible? Again some flaws in the thinking. Because it sure wrecked with it walking around in this movie. Still cool design team on the castle and the villages. Action is great and fast pace like the others.

4631524,1,B0059XTU3G,"This is the epitome of greedy, profit seeking laziness when it comes to movie making. Peter Jackson firmly clamped his career trajectory onto the Lord of the Rings franchise, but the cynical attempt to turn the 320 page novel into THREE two hour and forty minute spectacles is irresponsible and plumbs heretofore unheard of depths in the adaptation genre.  Singlehandedly re-writing the book to make it span a grand total of 8+ hours of screen time and enrich himself to the point that he never has to make another film again in his life is just too much for me.

But the film on its own merits sucks too. Countless ridiculous scenes where the ""camera"" scales out to show silly overwrought panoramas of poorly rendered (by 2014 standards) CGI villains swarming on the protagonists simply gets overwhelming. We've seen it infinite times in the previous 4 Peter Jackson hijackings of J.R.R. Tolkien works. And ""Lord of the Rings"" (the trilogy) was actually pretty decent film making. This series just sucks. Can I say it enough times?

4631572,4,B0059XTU3G,"There are so many conflicting emotions regarding The Hobbit series (three movies for one little book?) that it, like the movies themselves, will be hard to stay focused.  First off, we, as Tolkien fans, are happy to be watching this.  We're also happy that Peter Jackson is doing it.  But The Hobbit is probably one of my most beloved children's books and the fact that have elongated the story to spread it out between three movies is annoying at best.  People tend to get excited by the Desolation Of Smaug because we've been waiting nearly what? 4 hours of screen time? To see him.  Yeah.  We have.  Now there will be people out there defending Peter Jackson and his creative license with The Hobbit but let's cut through the BS and ask ourselves two very important questions: Why are the filmmakers adding all this extra stuff and manipulating the fabric of book?  Does it lend to the story?  Ok.  Everyone commence fighting amongst yourselves!  GO!  In my opinion, the added storylines, pulled from some of Tolkien's less-notable works, might enrich (or in reality merely lengthen the story to stretch a 317-page book into three movies that will gross, what? A billion dollars?) but I do not care for re-writing the story completely.  For example, Bilbo sneaks into the mountain and has a conversation with Smaug, in the book, as in the movie, this is what leads to Smaug's eventual rampage and his leaving the mountain to rain fire down on the Lakemen of Long Lake.  In the movie the dwarves roll in and next thing you know they're scampering about, dousing the angry dragon with smelted gold??? Huh?  So here's the deal.  Does Peter Jackson and his crew have the right to re-write a story that has stood the test of time for 77 years? Yes, The Hobbitt was originally published on September 21, 1937. Are the filmmakers beefing it up because The Hobbitt wasn't exciting enough?  Here I have to disagree.  To honor one of the most beloved books ever, stick to the story. The movie isn't called Peter Jackson's Interpretation Of The Hobbit In Three Long Installments, is it?  It probably should be.  Overall, the first movie puts me to sleep every time I watch it.  The second move had more action, but the glaring revamps enrage me.  I give it four stars because as a movie itself, it is stunning, clever, and amazing.  I guess we all have to learn to leave our literary heroes in our personal libraries and take whatever Hollywood is offering.

4631705,3,B0059XTU3G,"Reading my review of ""An Unexpected Journey"" will provide most of how I feel about this film too. The feelings are even more mixed, however, and more intensely so.

Again, the feel of Tolkien is gone even when inspiration was drawn from it. The animation and landscape design is still overwhelmingly wonderful. The excess explanation is even more murderous of the Tolkien myth and legend mystique.

SPOILERS FOLLOW.

The plot to kill Smaug with molten gold was, frankly, stupid. This was not in the book because Tolkien would not have made a nearly ageless Dwarf lord that stupid. An excuse to show us more of the sites and wonders of the abandoned Dwaven kingdom was appreciated, but it just flat out falls over on its own insanity. The beauty of the actual setting was what made anything work at all. Pity about the tacked-on, badly grafted plot ripped from Alien 3.

But it was gorgeous. The effects. The design. It was so beautiful. It was just as beautiful as the Elvish kingdom, but in an entirely different way. Right down to the molten statue of the Draven King. This genius was wasted on the terrible mutant plot and the awful, rotten dialogue.

And there's more wrong.

The divergence from the original plot of Bilbo remaining invisible was too ""interesting"" a choice. The Dwarf/Elf love affair is not true to the characters or of the description of the peoples from the original book. Especially egregious is the idea of a dwarf being considered appealing to an Elf. This divergence is not artistic licence -- it's just excessive. And it fails. I don't see how anyone at all could buy it, whether they had read any of the books or not. It frankly seems like Evangeline Lilly doesn't either. She's good at kicking ass and being a compassionate healer. There simply is no romantic spark in her, just a seeming aloof and uncomfortable compassion. Love story? She doesn't buy it and I don't either.

Gandalf visiting Dol Guldur made sense. Him knowing for certain that the Necromancer was Sauron makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The effects and design are more genius. The plot there makes a bit more sense but for the Sauron angle. But, man, how many staves does Gandalf go through? This is getting ridiculous.

Also, we know through the use of sir Ian's superior acting and Jackson's camera direction that Gandalf knows -- or suspects -- that Bilbo has a ring. Now, it's early in the plot, so I wouldn't be too stunned if Gandalf were willing to wait and see what it was at this point. But the idea that Gandalf would KNOW there were a powerful ring in the hand of a vulnerable friend that could be used for unspeakable evil wandering over to an ancient dragon who somehow ALSO seems to know about it (and Gandalf would likely know that Smaug would know, considering that Gandal f and Smaug are both ancient and learned) AND fail to intervene at all is just ridiculous. It wouldn't take 50 years for him to decide to do something about the ring. It wouldn't take you that long either (unless you're really stupid or stubborn). So, why the delay? Sure, letting it slide now. But something -- SOMETHING -- had to hold Gandalf back and obviously so for any of the rest of the film series to make sense. In the books by Tolkien, we neither had the Ringwraiths about nor a clear identity for the Necromancer. In the books, Gandalf was watching patiently, with nothing major happening to confirm his suspicions while the ring was in a known and relatively isolated, safe location. Here? Jackson and company have just made the entire film series absurd and Gandalf seem to be an idiot. I have a bit of a problem with that.

There is so much that works here so very well that it seems nasty to show irritation at any of it. But where Jackson messes up, he does so badly.

Again, I enjoyed this. Again, comparing it to how I feel about the books is not even possible. What was done well was done very, very well. What was botched there is frankly no excuse for and is a bit perplexing considering what Jackson and company has achieved. I think Jackson has been given too much power and doesn't have anyone to tell him when he is losing focus like another cinematic legend of late. Yes, Peter Jackson now has George Lucas syndrome.

I liked this. I don't love it. Worse, I pine for the film that this could have been.",1407110400,,4321,4.576972833117723

4631751,2,B0059XTU3G,"These reviews have me confused, wondering how many viewers actually read The Hobbit. I understand wanting to have one's own adaptation of a book as a director, but this felt so far off and farfetched that it was actually painful for me to watch. Some of the best scenes in the book were totally butchered. **POSSIBLE BOOK SPOILERS AHEAD** Beorn had been my absolute favorite character in The Hobbit book, and his scene was condensed to a small little portion that totally made him seem to be someone completely different. A magical event in the book thus was turned into a very teeny side event, which was a shame and a disappointment to see on the screen. The butchering of events was only furthered with the incorporation of a cringe worthy love story, and while the dialogue between Bilbo and Smaug during the dragon scene was almost spot on, it seemed to make absolutely no sense since he was visible.

I was overall very disappointed with the film and am hoping the 3rd one will bring back some justice.",1407024000,2,1008,4.631284916201118

4631994,4,B0059XTU3G,"I do have some misgivings about The Hobbit being split into three parts, as I'm sure many others do too. If it needed to be split at all, two parts would have done just fine, as the book is also divided into two parts. Still, I can't complain with most of what I've seen. Visually and in terms of spectacle, Peter Jackson continues to outdo himself with every successive film. Still, that doesn't change the fact that these movies have been padded with extra material in an effort to tie them more strongly to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, what Peter Jackson has given us is just fine and quite enjoyable. Riveting even.

 This film begins a year before Bilbo and the company start off on their journey at a meeting between Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf. While this might have been more at home in the previous installment, it does add character depth and clarifies the motivation behind wanting to take back the mountain. The film then proceeds to continue where the last one left off. On their way to the mountain, they encounter all manner of creatures, from giant spiders and orcs, to elves and humans. At times it feels a little episodic, with the company going from one setpiece to another, but the overall narrative thrust and ultimate goal keep the story going along at a nice pace.

 If there's one major complaint I have, and not just with this installment, it's that Peter Jackson has grown very reliant on CGI to augment, and in other cases completely replace practical effects. In no case is this more apparent as in the orcs, which are largely CGI. They worked very well in the Lord of the Rings as actual people with makeup, and I don't understand why they couldn't have continued that way in this Hobbit trilogy. Still, I digress slightly. There were also moments where it was clear that they were on sets. It took a little bit out of the magic of it all, but I was still wowed by the depth, breadth and level of detail in the landscapes. Also, for a movie with a lot of walking and talking, the action, when it came, served its purpose well. I kind of wish I had seen this in theaters for the sheer spectacle of it all. Two sequences that stand out in particular were a barrel escape from the elves, while being attacked by orcs, and the moment when the company finally meets Smaug. These two sequences stand out as being among the best in the trilogy so far, full of action and tension.

 Acting-wise, everyone gives a great performance, although I still can't really distinguish between most of the dwarfs. I'll also give major props to Benedict Cumberbatch for some outstanding voice work as Smaug. However, there were also a couple of small roles, one in particular (which I won't spoil) which kind of took me out of the movie. One final positive I'll mention is the incredible (as usual) score by Howard Shore. It really helps to set and maintain the epic tone of the film. Overall, while not perfect, THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is a stellar production of a classic story (or at least part of one) and sets up the finale quite nicely. Any serious film fan should want to see this, and I highly recommend watching it.",1405900800,,3158,4.531578947368421

4632070,2,B0059XTU3G,"This bloated, hyper version of The Hobbit, drawn out to ridiculous length by Hollywood's greedy desire to make one story into THREE movies, turns Tolkien's wonderful story into a Transformers video game for adolescents.  Jackson shows his contempt for Tolkien's book, as well as for fans of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" by larding out the story into 3 movies, seemingly just to make more money, because the writing quality of the fill-in material is so bad!  (Didn't he earn enough from the ""Rings"" movies, so that he could actually make a good job of this one?)  A perfect example of how Hollywood destroys a good story.  A real hyper-frenetic mess of a movie, which is all the more infuriating because the original story was so good.  They Hollywood-ized it.

At least in ""Rings,"" Jackson stayed mostly with the book's story.  ""Rings"" was a trilogy movie, because, well, the BOOK was a trilogy.  The Hobbit is a single book of reasonable length, and at most, it could have supported 2 movies.  To make 3 out of it means that the writers had to add in a lot of modern, trashy, fluffy, stupid, uninspired schlock WRITING that is NOT TOLKIEN.  It's Spiderman 2, Transformers 5, Fast and Furious 6, Marvel Comics 7, with CGI Orcs.  Frenetic video-game action for adolescents just took the place of Tolkien's clever and well-crafted tale.

Take the Elves.  Legolas wasn't in Tolkien's Hobbit but he's in here, in spades. (Why? Because Orlando Bloom has a large adolescent fan club?)  As is his babe companion female Elf (played by Evangeline Lilly).  These 2 Elves are simply frenetic, unstoppable killing machines who defy the laws of physics.  They kill giant spiders and Orcs with chilling, impossible, invulnerable robotic efficiency, over and over again until you just get worn out and disgusted.  Then you realize that Jackson put all that ""action"" in there to fill out the movie.  But it's way, way too long -- it's a 2 1/2 hour movie that should be maybe 1 hour 45 minutes.  That's about 45 minutes of simple ""action""; ridiculous, over-the-top, orc-killing, stupendous, stupidly directed, frenetic ""action.""  You even start rooting for one of those poor Orcs to get SOME licks in there, against these impossibly invulnerable Elves.

[Warning -- Spoilers!!!]
One example of Jackson ruining the wonderful Tolkien story with his own schlock writers:  in the original Hobbit, Bilbo frees the other dwarves from the spiders by putting on the ring and tricking the spiders, taunting them, drawing them away etc.  But in this modern rehash they all fight the spiders to the death, and then in come the invulnerable Elf-Assassins to finish the job.  Especially Evangeline Lilly's Elf, a bizarre combination of effortless, ferocious killing machine and sensitive beauty.  Of course, not a Dwarf or an Elf gets a single spider scratch on them!

Another example:  in the original Hobbit, the Dwarves escape from Smaug the dragon in the Lonely Mountain by hiding, and the awakened, enraged dragon then flies out to destroy the Lake-town.  Here, we take a 20 minute detour while the Dwarves do all sorts of battling, frenetic, ridiculous video-game ""action"" fighting Smaug, even melting huge pots of gold to dump on him, of course hurting him not at all and of course, none of the Dwarves getting a scratch on them, before Smaug flies out to do in the town.  By the time all this stupid, excessive ""action"" is done, you're exhausted, saying to yourself ""get on with the story!"", and then the story ends.  You'll have to pay for a third movie.  Ripoff.

They should've stuck by the story and stopped at 2 movies for the Hobbit.  Jackson and his producers ruined a great story.  Hollywood strikes again.  A hack-job, and as someone else said, it shows the unraveling of the ""Rings"" film franchise.  I can't see why any Tolkien fans would give it more than 2 stars.",1405468800,10,3850,4.842266462480858

4632114,1,B0059XTU3G,"As a Tolkien purist, and a person who read the entire gamut of Tolkien's Middle Earth books once a year, every year, for something like twenty-five years, the movie versions don't seem right to me. The Hobbit movie has characters and scenes not in the book with dialogue that makes no sense to the overall ""book"" story.

If I'd never seen the books let alone read them, the movies might be fine. The acting is powerful, Ian McKellen is as always a superb actor and truth be told, is the only actor alive who could do Gandalf's part ever since seeing him in the Lord of the Rings trilogy films.

Maybe I'm spoiled by having read those books; and setting them in my mind as the ultimate fantasy story and the grandfather of any stories that followed. Terry Brooks, Eric Flint, Harry Turtledove, Piers Anthony and so many other authors owe their careers to J.R.R. Tolkien and the genre. So it is with a sad heart that the films are too far away from the original books for an old guy like me to enjoy the story as envisioned by Peter Jackson.

Granted, the ability to tell the story in detail as told in the books would take a mini-series or perhaps, a season or two on television - but that's not what Jackson did. Sorry Peter. I won't buy the third movie and am going to give the first two movies to someone who hasn't read the books.

For all of you out there who like the movies, that's cool. Just because I don't like them doesn't mean you have to try to blast my review as if your opinion was/is better than mine. So be nice, please.",1405296000,4,1536,4.304498269896194

Of course, the first night we watched less than half of the movie.  We went to resume the movie tonight and found out we had paid $4.99 to watch less than half the movie and that was it!

We will be resuming our Netflix DVD subscription after this experience.  I guess if you are a student/single person this business plan might work for you.  $5 for a 24 hour rental is not practical for our purposes!

4632165,1,B0059XTU3G,"This film features very poor storytelling. Compared to standard fantasy-action films, it's mediocre but not terrible. The costumes, CGI, etc. are well done and it's an entertaining ride for a while if you're looking for a non-stop string of dwarf humor, overly dramatic dialogue that emphasizes the value of petty individualism, Sauron references, and orc beheadings. However, the bar should be set much higher for these films.

The spirit and themes of the Middle Earth books (not just the Hobbit) are completely lost in this segment with plot filler and terrible interpretations of many characters. The entire point of Tolkien's story is the mythic struggle between good and evil... while the entire point of this movie seems to be pushing the audience's adrenaline buttons.

In order to make this film long enough to fill the arbitrary limit of 2.5 hours, they added several unnecessary plot lines that have zero basis in Tolkien.  Others have summarized it well here already, but there is a made-up love triangle, invented conflict between Bard and the Master of Lake-town, Legolas? wtf I love you Orlando Bloom, but why??, a made-up orc pack traipsing around Lake-town, Gandalf traipsing around... well, you can see for yourself.... and the ridiculous last scenes with the dragon. I understand some changes are essential to adapt any book to film, but seriously! These are all totally unhelpful.

Also, is the addition of a female elf supposed to be some sort of win for women? So that girls can learn that female characters only exist to fulfill male fantasies (beautiful, kind-hearted, lookin' for an average guy with a sense of humor, and she kills orcs like a pro, too, gentlemen!)?  Eowyn's character in Two Towers was much better.

In summary, I understand why non-readers like this film, but mass audiences deserve to know the spirit of Tolkien's Hobbit. There is really no justification for drawing this into three movies except for greed on the part of the filmmaker. The plot filler was hastily thought out and kills the story. Two movies would have been plenty. Shame on you, Mr. Jackson.",1405123200,5,2104,5.01432664756447

He cut out a few things I'd have liked to have seen on screen (The Scouring of the Shire), but I could understand cutting them to keep it to 3 movies and not have them be 3+ hour movies, and the stuff he cut didn't really subtract from the story.  With his Hobbit trilogy, he is adding in and changing events to drag the story out longer and give it extra action, and in the end, he's making the story worse for it.

Martin Freeman was absolutely the perfect Bilbo Baggins. Can't imagine anyone else acting the part as well. I am a huge fan of BBC's Sherlock Holmes with both actors.

4632360,5,B0059XTU3G,"I know, I know - it's really departs from the book and the mary-sue elf can be annoying with how perfect she is and how much of a bad*** fighter she is (though the biggest gripe I have is the elf-dwarf love scenario), and I told my mother after seeing it in theaters that I just could not defend it against the Tolkien canon police like I will with the original trilogy as Jackson really has taken the book, tossed it into a trash barrel, lit it on fire, then roasted marshmallows in the flames while deciding what he wanted to happen.

But I still liked it for its own merits, nonetheless!  It's not the book, no, but the audiences are different, and I personally don't have a problem seeing the movies and the books as different and separate versions - after all, the comics do it all the time with their characters!  How many versions of the x-men do we have now?  And yes, I know that comics aren't close to being in the same league as Tolkien, but still, who hasn't read a book and envisioned what ifs or alternate scenarios with their favorite characters?  Jackson just turned his into a block-buster movie......

I still prefer the first movie myself, but I think what makes both so interesting to me is the actors and their portrayals.  Though I really wish, knowing how the story ends, that Thorin wasn't done so well!

Also:  when I bought the DVD, I got a free digital copy from ultralight.  The digital copy is nice to have to watch on my Roku, but would not play well at all from ultralight - the movie stuttered and stopped.  Finally, I gave up on the ultralight copy and went to Amazon and bought it and have had no problems.  Amazon's video service really is much, much better than ultralight!

It was a little long but I thought it had a good mix of funny and serious parts with really unique imagery. The dragon is also great, with an unexpectedly snarky sense of humor.

Now I'm in the funky position of hoping for resolve in what I hope will be the finale to the looming doom throughout  ""Desolation"" and the climatic flight of the soulless dragon, Smaug toward the helpless village at the base on Lonely Mountain. I have been fortunate to have seen
all of the ""Back to the Future"" features, ""Star Wars"" to the beginning of The Dark Lord, Darth Vader. I promised myself after surviving The Lord of the Rings ""Return of the King,"" I was done.

The addition of Legolas was disappointing, his CGI (in fact all the CGI outside of Smaug) was awful. The love interest, why does there always need to be a love interest, distracts from the main story and has no place in this. Beorn was giving short shrift and the story of how the entire group ends up in his house was completely left out. Smaug desolates nothing, which is misleading if you expect him to attack Lake Town in this movie.

All in all, thought I wouldn't have thought it possible, this is worse than the first movie. If you want to watch the Hobbit on TV watch the animated version from 1977. It is far better.",1404172800,4,831,4.253164556962025

4632421,2,B0059XTU3G,"If you want to enjoy The Desolation of Smaug, you need to forget Tolkiens The Hobbit because Peter Jacksons movie strays quite a bit from the novel.  Ill explain how, but I also want to reflect on the mystifying and perhaps troubling experience of going to the theater.
 Jacksons adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy was excellent.  Its chief weaknesses were his limited additions to Tolkiens storyline.  The first segment of his cinematic version of The Hobbit increased this tendency and in addition began to rewrite parts of the story, much to its disadvantage (See my post Hobbits as Heroes [...] ).  Peter Jackson intrudes even more in The Desolation of Smaug.  The result is that you get some fast-paced elf action, a literally incredible dwarf challenge to the dragon and a very well done Smaug, but the greed of the dwarves, the mystery of Beorn and the gloomy oppression of Mirkwood Forest are lost.
 Jackson also makes a couple of errors.  Dwarves going down the rapids in open barrels would meet a watery grave, not make a thrilling escape while threatened by orcs.
Furthermore, how did the dwarves manage to have all that money after they had been imprisoned by the wood elves?
 However, the most baffling moment of the evening for me actually came at the conclusion of the film.  Immediately upon its completion little lights came on all around the theater.  People were checking their cell phones.  It was most wondrous strange.  I would attribute my perplexity to a generational difference, but patrons of all ages were doing it.  People didn't talk about the movie.  They certainly didn't remain seated and think about it or even savor the movie for a little longer.
 What does this mean?  I am sure that no one was dealing with an emergency or had an appointment they needed to verify on a Friday night.  In fact, Im not sure anyone was actually calling another person.  No.  It would appear that for most of the moviegoers the experience was over, and it was time to move on to something different.  A couple of patrons whom I observed more closely were working through the various icons on their phones to find something that interested them, something that would stimulate them visually, I suspect.
 As my colleague Trent Leach, who has an excellent blog by the way ([...]), never tires of reminding our students at Cair Paravel Latin School, amusement literally means not thinking.  I am concerned for my amusing fellow human beings because not thinking makes them less human and more like beasts, passively absorbing the stimuli of the entertainment industry like Nebuchadnezzar grazing cow-like on the grass after having lost his mind.  Ironically, by not reflecting on the entertainment, they also lose out on the pleasure that comes from discussing with others what they had just experienced.
 If anyone has some other explanation for this behavior, please enlighten me.  In the meantime, The Desolation of Smaug is a middling fun fantasy adventure movie.  Watch it, if you want, but if you do, go out with your friends afterwards, grab a bite and talk about it.  Or far better yet, read Tolkiens Hobbit and really have some fun.  If not, youll experience a desolation far worse than any dragon could bring upon you.",1403913600,,3248,4.833333333333333

It doesn't seem like it, but for anybody who doesn't know what The Hobbits about this movie has a lot of action and adventure in it. Any Hobbit/Lord of the Rings fan would love these movies. I can't wait to watch it on blue ray.

That part has so much action in it.

I knew we were in for a rough ride when the very smallest, and simplest of Tolkein's entire sage was stretched and twisted to the epic length of the entire Ring Trilogy, cinema graphically.

I remember the Hobbit being a very slow starter, but to the best of my recollection, the middle was where it became a rip roaring, read with a flashlight after lights out, heart stopping thriller.  What happened?  I only thank god I missed it in the cinema and, watching in the privacy of my own home, could take the necessary breaks to do calisthenics and take caffeine in order to keep body and soul alert enough to endure to the end.

Ultimately, I can forgive them much; but not the fabrication of an elf/dwarf love triangle upon which to hang the perilously thinly stretched fabric of this idiotically augmented plot.  The device, apparently meant to provide supportive tenter hooks of suspense, in my opinion, comes off more like a cloth mangle, twisting the beautiful design of a cherished story into an unrecognizably gaudy image.

I just wish they had stuck to Tolkein's pacing, making The Desolation of Smaug a natural middle section of a simply cohesive work, instead of a bizarre sequel to itself.  One can only hope that the director and writer(s) had either stopped, or resumed, as need presented, the taking of their prescription drugs by the time the third part went into production.",1403740800,3,1511,4.718631178707224

My only dislike was that the movie ended with a chopped off scene and we all looked at each other and wondered why such a poor ending.  It is obviously a hook to the next film to make more money.  The movie is also 161 minutes long and it looks like the editor did not know what to chop out of the film to make it shorter.  There is a lot of action and some of the scenes are funny and others are violent.  I still enjoyed the film as it was entertaining.

Also, just like the first hobbit film, there was too much obvious CGI and fight scenes that were so ridiculous they broke the suspension of disbelief. Elves were surfing on orcs? Really?

Overall, a disappointment.

4632498,4,B0059XTU3G,"My major objection to ""The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug"" is that Peter Jackson has departed too far from the original books in this film.  In the ""Lord of the Rings  trilogy""  departures from the original story were minimal and not jarring.  In ""The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey""  There were some changes (mostly additional material) but I found those acceptable.  However, in ""The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug"" there are glaring contradictions with the original text, that I found disturbing.  IF you have not read the book, ""The Hobbit""; then this will most likely not bother you; since, on its own it is a good story.  But, for a Tolkein purist such as myself, the film is inferior to the book BECAUSE of the changes in ""Desolation of Smaug"".",1403481600,3,755,4.666666666666667

4632513,1,B0059XTU3G,I was willing to accept that Peter Jackson reinterpreted the Lord of the Rings by skipping Tom Bombadil which was a big distraction from the plot and that better romantic development between Aragorn and Arwen. But all the revisions once the dwarves and Bilbo entered Thranduil's kingdom seem like inappropriate departures. It got worse when Bilbo entered Smaug's layer and setup a much different scenario than the book. I won't go and deeper than that because I don't want to spoil anything.,1403395200,8,491,5.0

Am I too old now to appreciate this new blu ray technology? If not, please agree with me there should be more color in this movie. When did they come out with blu ray in gray only? This film is the grayest film I have ever seen. People are gray, rocks, sky everything. This is blu ray? This is a very long film meaning special effects are there but I must say also boring.
I may be wrong but I rate a film as being at least a few things to make it captivating and this film didn't do that for me. I seen rock,I seen people climbing rocks, supernatural beasts which were actually gray in color also, imagine that.
I never laughed, cried, oohed or aahed or caught a glimmer what this film was trying to get across to the audience.

The first two movies are based loosely, and I do mean loosely, on Tolkien's beloved classic, but have far too many extra characters and unnecessary battle scenes shoved into places where they shouldn't be.

All in all The Hobbit movie trilogy should have been done as one movie, with better characterizations, streamlined story and plot without so many extra battle scenes shoved in for no good reason.  There would have been more than enough action in The Battle Of The Five Armies to satisfy any fan.

4632589,4,B0059XTU3G,"Let the haters hate the first film, I enjoyed it. In fact I loved the nostalgia I felt when I returned to Middle Earth last year. Well leave it to Peter Jackson to deliver the action and then some tenfold in The Desolation of Smaug. This movie was well worth the wait; the dwarves are as likable as ever, the musical score is off the charts, the set pieces are beautiful, Smaug himself is WONDERFUL (mad props to Benedict Cumberbatch for his portrayal of the dragon) Though the Lord of the Rings Trilogy will always have my heart, the new Hobbit trilogy is doing great and this is one movie you should definitely check out.

Starring Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, all the characters from the first film return as the Dwarves get closer to the Mountain, their long abandoned kingdom, and a fire breathing dragon. Along the way they must deal with all kinds of monstrosities; Giant spiders, dark forests, orcs, elves, treacherous humans, and magical enchantments. The action is so much faster paced than the first that even the most critical fan of the first film won't be able to say anything. From battles with the spiders, to orcs, to a fiery (pun intended) showdown with Smaug himself, i was sitting on the edge of my seat.

Ive always loved Peter Jackson and what he can do with movies in Middle Earth. The scenery has always been a deal maker for me, and this movie is full of beautiful, breathtaking views. I don't care if a lot of the film is CGI, just seeing huge valleys, underground caves, lush forests, and surreal looking landscapes, it brings out the adventurer in me and I want to go run up a hill or something after watching one of these films! The movie is beautiful to look at and hear, as the score is just wonderful, all the right sounds and music for the right moments.

The actors do a great job themselves, and I personally liked the inclusion of the character Tauriel, though she wasn't in the book, she adds a much needed addition of a strong female character. Plus it gives a great balance to Orlando Bloom's character Legolas, which is a welcome addition to the story as well in my opinion.

This film is fun, fast paced, exciting at many times, and the conversation between Bilbo and the Dragon is just awesome to see. The whole audience in the theater I was in held its breath when the scene finally came. It was wonderful and truly a great moment in my theater viewing history personally.

But really I found it quite disappointing. Some scenes (especially the chase through the river in barrels) seem to carry on forever, with our old friend Legalas performing with abilities you would really only expect from a Marvel Comics super hero. And the attempt at smoldering romance between a dwarf and an elf seems like a reach, not believable at all.

This film is certainly worth watching, but I was disappointed after the achievements of the previous four movies. Smaug really is the coolest dragon ever to appear in cinema.",1402876800,,688,4.922413793103448

4632667,4,B0059XTU3G,"This second installment in the Tolkien story of how Bilbo got the One Ring is markedly better than the first, and as a more-or-less mindless popcorn flick, it is certain to provide entertainment for all ages.  Returning for this film are a series of shot-to-spawn-a-theme-park-ride sequences, this time highlighted by the barrel ride down the river.  I have to admit that I disliked the interpretation (if that's what it's called) of this particular segment of the story, but even as someone who really hated the mine-cart sequence on the first Hobbit film, I've got to give this one the props it deserves.

The action choreography is top-notch in this film, and the side-stories all lend more credibility to the main story's scope and potential impact on the world of Middle Earth.  The brooding Thorin Oakenshield really does start to come into focus in this film as well, with a much more well-developed arc that sets the stage for the final film's inevitable showdown while doing a reasonable job of avoiding 'good guy, bad guy' labeling of the parties involved.

And, of course, any review of this film must include a description of Smaug.  Now, the CGI was impressive, Benedict Cumberbatch was magnificent, and Martin Freeman actually did a convincing job of a Hobbit doing his best not to quake in his boots standing in the middle of a dragon's hoard.

Which brings me to a serious peeve: the hoard.  I really, really do understand the desire to make the dragon's hoard a thing of beauty and awe-inspiring to behold...but while I was watching I did some quick back-of-the-napkin math on the AMOUNT of treasure and came up with - in rough terms and shooting for the LOW side of the scale - at least five TRILLION dollars worth of precious metals serving as Smaug's bedding.  With that much money at stake there is simply no way the rulers of Middle Earth wouldn't have collectively raised their armies, marched on the mountain en masse, and started throwing their soldiers at the dragon several years before this film's events took place.

Other than that, I - and my knee-highs - very much enjoyed the movie for what it was.  It's no Lord of the Rings, but it's a rock-solid action/adventure fantasy film.",1402790400,,2212,4.794736842105263

Since that's all I can really say on the product, I suppose I'll add a review of the movie.  If you read the Hobbit and loved it, this movie will make you very upset.  It adds in so many things (elfess/dwarf love story, Legolas, Gandalf and Radagast going to the Necromancer, PoV scenes from the Orcs, trying to melt Smaug with gold) that are not present in the books.  Peter Jackson did a wonderful job converting the LoTR story from book to screen, but in this case it seems as though he just packed it with action scenes to appeal to a larger audience and make as much money as possible.

From the perspective of someone just watching the movie and not thinking about the book, it was good.  My biggest complaint was that in the books Bilbo put on the ring and danced around taunting and slaying spiders in Mirkwood, and he did nothing of the sort here.  In the book, that was a big moment for him where he gained quite a bit of confidence in himself.",1402617600,,1056,4.3520408163265305

For all those who say that Jackson has made a new version of The Hobbit that we can now appreciate alongside the book, shut the heck up. The amount this story was changed to make a new version of The Hobbit for people to like is equivalent to fan fiction at best and horrific corruption of the story at worst. Its as if I wanted to tell a story about the Vietnam war, but Hitler is still alive and there is a foreshadowing 9/11 with not-so-subtle rumors of Bin Laden every 15 minutes. There is not a single significant event in this entire movie that didn't have a big and unnecessary change from the book to the movie.

The main orc should be dead before the journey began in the first movie; Legolas should not be there; Radagast should not be there; Tauriel should not be there (or anywhere, since her character doesnt exist); Bilbo didn't know about the Arkenstone beforehand; the dwarves were in the Elvish prison for at least a month before Biblo let them out (not just one day); Gandalf did not have any discoveries about Sauron like that in the movie, despite there being rumors of a necromancer and an encounter with him in the North (else Gandalf must have completely forgotten all about Sauron when he hung out with Bilbo later and didn't wonder about the ring very much); the barrels with the dwarves in them had lids and straw and Bilbo rode on top (hence Bilbos nickname Barrelrider, not Barrel-periphery like in this movie); no dwarf was poisoned by an orc blade; there was no need to reference kingsfoil, as if PJ was remaking FoTR; there was no stupid dwarf smuggling situation with Bard at Lake Town; Beorn was a huge, muscular jolly man who only had milk and honey for food and whom they had to approach a few dwarves at a time, not some moping mountain man with a variety of food for everyone whose home they broke into until he transformed from a bear to said moping man; the dwarves did nothing with the spiders because they were drugged up on venom while Bilbo sang and killed all the spiders; there was only one black arrow and it was Bards; there was nothing magic about black arrows per se, the black arrow was simply Bards lucky arrow and he was boss with it; the dwarves were not such jerks to Bilbo by this point; Bilbo was sent in to spy concerning Smaug, not sent to retrieve the Arkenstone, of which he knew nothing; there were no orcs invading Lake Town; Bilbo was not such an idiot about taking off the ring when it would be advantageous to have it on (around a dragon, around spiders, etc); there was no dwarf plan to cover Smaug in molten gold (as if that would work, since hes a freaking dragon and is immune to heat); the dwarves barely saw Smaug (if at all) before he was shot down at Lake Town

All these aside from the blatant overuse of CGI (sometimes really bad CGI), excess use of fight scenes (often ridiculous fight scenes) when no fighting occurred, the overwhelmingly obvious fact that Peter Jackson was making this into another LOTR movie (evidence for that is strewn throughout the movie), and the completely wrong tone of the movie for the story all these force me to give this awful adaptation of a beloved story 1 star. Id give it a 0 if it let me, but perhaps the good actors acting with a wretched script is worth 1 star. Shame on you, Peter Jackson, for ruining this story. It should not bear the name of The Hobbit due to its enormous deviations from the story in all except the ultimate summary, namely that dwarves go after treasure with a hobbit and piss off a dragon guarding the treasure.",1402358400,24,3874,4.468926553672317

4632715,5,B0059XTU3G,Good show. It entertained me. I liked how the actors had lines and spoke them as if they were different people....,1402358400,,114,4.476190476190476
4632716,5,B0059XTU3G,"I chose this movie to add to collection I have. Read all the books wanted to see how close the story line was in the movie!!
I would recommend this to all viewers who like this type of movie,",1402358400,,191,3.923076923076923
4632717,5,B0059XTU3G,I'm glad I finally pulled the trigger and watched this version. Enjoyed it tremendously and can't wait for the next story to come out. Would recommend if you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.,1402358400,,201,4.315789473684211
4632718,5,B0059XTU3G,It was cool.... I just watched it for the first time right after watching part one.... I may even go see part 3 in the theater.,1402358400,,127,3.923076923076923
4632719,4,B0059XTU3G,"I've heard many people complain about this film because of how far it departed from the book. I've also heard people complain about a children's book being made into a trilogy just to get more of our money. Maybe that's why it was done, but I myself couldn't have been more thrilled for three more Peter Jackson films taking place in Middle Earth. If you want JRR Tolkein's ""The Hobbit,"" go read the book. This trilogy is not that story, but a different version of the story. I myself enjoy the different take and many of the new plot lines.

I docked one star because I thought the love triangle was a little cheesy, as were some minor parts in some of the action sequences.",1402358400,,675,4.4
4632720,3,B0059XTU3G,"Fans of the books will be disappointed that Jackson didn't just pad the movies with some additional material for length.  He's completely changed characters, scenes and motivations.  This is somewhat understandable, as the ring was not depicted as the powerful talisman of evil in Tolkien's Hobbit as it later would become, and he feels compelled to tie The Hobbit in as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings.  He's just done a poor job of it.

Cutting about 40 minutes out of the gratuitous action sequences would also be an improvement.  There's only so many times you can watch Legolas kill an orc before you've seen every possible permutation.  They really don't seem like much of a threat when the characters churn though them like butter.  I guess Jackson felt like anything less than a two and a half hour movie would be too short.",1402358400,4,835,4.678082191780822
4632731,5,B0059XTU3G,"This is one of those films that needs 2 (maybe even 3 separate ratings). This movie is the second in the ""Hobbit Trilogy"" of movies and brings the viewers face-to-face with the grand menace of the book - Smaug. Much has been made of Jackson's decision to shoot using 48 fps and his excessive use of CGI. Quite frankly, having seen the film both in 3D HFR and standard 2D, I thought the difference was almost night and day, with the HFR version being far superior. Line details were crisper, shadows and light were more defined. Everything about the moving image quality was enhanced.

As for use of CGI, there are a few moments where I thought the movie went overboard, especially in the fast-paced action sequences. However, I have to grant that the cost of trying to achieve the same scenes through modelling would likely be cost-prohibitive if they were even remotely possible. Thirteen dwarfs and a hobbit are an awful lot of digital re-sizing to accommodate. From the standpoint of someone going to the movie solely to enjoy a swords and sorcery high fantasy adventure, this film is fun and delivers on all fronts while including enough content for kids to keep their attention and enough content for adults to keep them from losing their minds.

5 Stars: That was the purpose of the film - to create an exciting and fun fantasy epic for the big screen. So for that I give the movie its 5 stars.

3 Stars: As an adaptation of Tolkien's works, the movie falls far short of its ""Part I"" predecessor. An entirely unnecessary romantic side-plot was included and then expanded upon in ways that are downright ludicrous in terms of middle-earth mythos. As an adaptation of the book, up to the point where the movie ends, I feel I'm being somewhat generous giving the movie 3 stars. It includes nearly all the material, but the additions, some made entire from whole cloth, not taken from other works, simply detract from the story entirely.

5 stars: Love it or hate it, the movie has been presented in a visually stunning and audibly enjoyable way. Many of the techniques being used are paving the way for how future epic movies will be shot.",1402358400,,2142,4.643799472295514
4632732,3,B0059XTU3G,I have loved all the Hobbit movies and looked forward to this one.  I was very disappointed in it.  Parts of it actually bordered on the ridiculous.,1402358400,,148,4.444444444444445
4632733,5,B0059XTU3G,"I had hoped to see the movie out in theaters but never got the chance. When I saw the price of $9.99 I had to buy it and watched it that afternoon. The picture quality was great and the plot and action did not disappoint me. The almost three hour movie flew by and I enjoyed every second of it.

Tolkien purists might disapprove of any deviation from the canon, but I recognize that movies can't always be the book taken directly to film.

It takes all the good things of the 1st one like great story, acting, action and special effects and removed all the boring drudgery of the last one: Long boring dialogues, long silent scenes and thankfully NO MORE SINGING!!! The star of the movie is definitely Smaug. He's the coolest dragon ever beats the snake from Harry Potter and even the more recent Godzilla. For the collectors, it's definitely a buy.",1402358400,,437,4.7631578947368425

4632742,4,B0059XTU3G,"My ten year old son, my husband and I watched this after my husband previewed to make sure it was ok for our son to watch, given it is pg-13. My son loved it.  Especially Smaug as he loves dragons.  It prompted lots of discussions about how such movies are made (live actors and actual settings v. Computer generated, etc).  And conversation about how the movies differ from the book, which he has read and loved.  My rating is based on our enjoyment of the experience, I'm not a movie critic, but it was a nice evening and a special treat for him as he isn't allowed to watch many pg-13 movies.  It may be too scary and violent for some 10 year olds so I would say if you don't have a child that usually watches violent tv/movies you should preview.  The fact that the gore and violence  in this involves fantastical characters and settings rather than ""real"" violence (such as a movie that deals with people in everyday life scenarios encountering violent ends) allowed my son to watch it and not get too scared, just enough for a good cinematic chill.",1402358400,,1054,4.430051813471502

4632745,2,B0059XTU3G,"I have two main complaints about this one. The first is that it departs too much from the book story.  It is a common complaint, but in this case I think it is warranted, because it departs pretty radically and unnecessarily from the book story.

The second is that it has way too much CGI stuff in it.  They went the cheap and lazy way and as a result lots of the movie is like watching cartoons or someone play a video game.",1402272000,,426,4.108433734939759

This episode recapitulates the some tired feminist claptrap that showed up in the person of Arwen in the movie rendition of the trilogy.  Tiresome to say the least.  And that's just the start.

As others have pointed out, Peter Jackson's over-reliance on uninspiring computer generated graphics creates a heavy drag on a story that above all else requires a heightened imagination to be believable. Setting aside basic technical flaws such as arrows finding their mark with discernible suction cups and the total absence of blood on any of those swords whacking into orcs and wargs, the big let-downs are the treatment of such grand fictive creations as Sauron and particularly, Smaug. He who is ""fire"" and ""death"" really isn't terribly frightening although he blows a good flame and employs excellent diction.
Peter Jackson succeeded as well as he did in the ""Lord of the Rings"" because he made it character-driven. Whatever special effects enhancements, and there were many, never overshadowed the actors, script or wonderful cinematography. When left to the skills of actors such as Martin Freeman, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lilly and Luke Evans, ""Smaug"" really does take flight and catch fire. Left to devices, prosthetic, cosmetic or computer graphic, it is hard not to end with a cartoonish result when so many of the characters who occupy the screen unavoidably bring Walt Disney to mind.",1401926400,,1424,5.1645021645021645

There are a few moments when the directing is a bit off and they have a hard time being reasonable with molten gold (you can't ride on a river of molten gold with only a shield between you and the gold without getting horribly burned).

Having said all that, this one was pretty entertaining.  I liked it better than the first because there was more interesting action.

4632867,2,B0059XTU3G,"The Hobbit was a short book that, despite significant padding with CGI and awkward, Star-Wars-prequelesque insertion of characters from the previous, more successful trilogy of films, really cannot be stretched into three films.  The plot drags (ironically, the Lord of the Rings is the story of a man walking towards a mountain for three whole books and it still has more going on than this movie), the inserted romance is awkward, unbelievable, and doesn't fit well with the rest of the story, and the unfortunate situation of being ""the middle movie"" means that it lacks a satisfying beginning and end.

The CG varies from impressive (the dragon) to some mish-mash of pathetic and bizarre (Legolas ends up looking like a children's doll come to life in a horror film), but it all comes across as immersion-breaking computer work, not realism.

As expected, the acting is solid (not always a given with green screen), but it wasn't entrancing enough to draw me into the story or sell the muddled plotlines.  All in all, this movie felt more like a (very expensive) B-movie knockoff of Lord of the Rings than it did a worthy follow-up to the original films.",1401840000,,1158,4.862944162436548

From a visual perspective, the scenery is gorgeous and the backgrounds stunning with marvelous attention to fine details. The action scenes lend themselves to breathless anticipation and quite a few hearty laughs. Smaug is as awesome and fearsome as Bilbo declares in his wonderful encounter with the dragon. Overall, the characters develop with layers that lend a richness I see in very few films. I enjoy Bilbo and his rise from a somewhat shallow existence. Gandalf is secretive, humorous, and determined. I love the fresh background on Legolas, and Lee Pace is captivating as Thranduil. Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin is masterful when it comes to building his character with the finest nuances of expression.

The dvd is fairly faithful to Tolkiein's book until the escape of Bilbo and the dwarfs for the prison of the Silvan Elfs. From there on there are differences between the dvd and Tolkien's book. They involve the pursuit of Bilbo and the dwarfs from the Silvan elf kingdom to Esgaroth. Also, it introduces Legolas who appears later in the Lord of Rings but does not appear in Tolkien's The Hobbit. However, in general it follows the themes in the book.",1401580800,,552,4.585858585858586

I was surprised, on my second viewing, at how my opinion changed. Mr. Jackson has transformed the Hobbit into an adult story - really adult,  not pornographic - and the character development is really engrossing. There are still faults - the escape from Thranduil's hall still looks like a promo for an upcoming Hobbitland theme park - but the story has gained in psychological depth what it has lost in innocence.

4633022,3,B0059XTU3G,"Jacksons version of The Hobbit isn't a bad piece of work once a person looks past the divergences from Tolkien.  On its own merits, its a complex and engaging tale, but Jacksons penchant for overindulging his imagination results in a movie thats too long and drawn out, overshadowing the parts that are stellar.

There are real gems hereMartin Freemans captivating portrayal of Bilbo deserves to be front and center; Lee Pages Thranduil commands every scene he is in; Gandalfs struggle with Sauron and the creativity of the action sequences are just a few of them.  But these are interspersed with material that adds little to the overall story and instead drags it down.  Every scene involving Tauriel and Kili could have been cut.  The antipathy of the Laketown Master and his advisor against Bard was unnecessary.  The episode at the hidden door was stretched to an agonizing length and the overlong barrel escape was packed with too many stunts.  The orc attack on Laketown seemed like an excuse for another battle and to show off Legolass fighting skills.  It didn't contribute to the plot.  Finally, the interactions with Smaug were the climax of the film, but instead of letting viewers stay with Bilbo and the dwarves, feeling the increasing tension and peril of proximity to the dragon, Jackson cuts away six times to show activities elsewhere, interruptions that break the momentum.  I felt as though Bilbo had been talking to Smaug for hours rather than a heart-pounding several minutes, and that the dwarves battled endlessly with him.

There is wisdom in the saying less is more.  Jackson seems to feel that more is better.  If I watch this movie again, Ill make use of the Fast Forward button.",1401408000,,1707,4.885416666666667
4633023,3,B0059XTU3G,"Okay, let's be honest here. It is a good entertaining film. But for us who saw the Lord of the Rings series, this offered little thrill, except for dragon. Really don't like Jackson trying to tie the two books themes together. Rather he just stayed true to book rather than go off on his own. And good grief another Gandolf in the tower episode to build suspense. And talking of suspense, Jackson is a suspense junkie. He makes suspense in every shot it seems that it is almost gratuitous. I still bought here and saw it in the theaters and if I really hated it that much then I guess I wouldn't have done either. So, yes, I am a hypocrite.",1401408000,,640,4.297520661157025

No character, much less plot development, the tale has been reduced to comic book mentality with any script just leading up to another 'car chase' action sequence with stop action frames of Bloom and limpid lip Lilly posing, and scenes of Freeman looking and acting incredibly stupid

However, the bleakness, the frenetic chasing, the hideous creatures, the never-quite-getting-it-right ratio of Hobbit size to the rest of the word...all of these things have frayed my once great love of the first trilogy.  And now this trilogy just feels like an insult.  There really isn't enough plot to stretch out through three films; the character development is even shallower here than in the first trilogy, despite the unbelievable length of screen time they take.

I even have the Return of the King on VHS - probably one of the last movies on VHS... The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it threads a love story into it, one I could almost do without - it's touching and sweet, but not the reason I want to watch the movie. There's a lot of computer animation for some scenes and at some point, it's almost a little too much (some laws of physics seem to be ignored) - but I still enjoy watching this movie and have happily watched it multiple times. I recommend this movie not so much for the story as this one seems to drag on a little more than it needs to, but for the characters and the world that has been created.

4633177,2,B0059XTU3G,"These new hobbit movies just don't capture the image the book gives you. I was highly disappointed on how much was changed or made up. Probably my biggest complaint is thorin. I always pictured him grown up with a long beard, big nose and frankly dwarf in appearance. Why they gave him a baby face with little more than 5 o'clock shadow I don't know? The actor they got to play bilbo looks older and wiser than thorin in this movie. We know he dies at the end but dying a baby and not a wise mature dwarf will ruin that scene of him and bilbos last conversation. Child of the kindly west won't work when bilbo looks older than thorin. I remember being a kid watching that scene when thorin and bilbo talk the last time and it will stick with me forever. And the orcs?? Besides the fact there was no main Orc villain in the book there weren't any orcs in the book period! It was all goblins. They weren't constantly chased for one place to another by goblins and a lot had more to do with the journey than hacking and slashing. Beorn.. Too scrawny, I always pictured him to look like an actual man, like a buff lumberjack mountain man. He didn't lose control when changed into a bear and when he loaned them ponies he followed them in bear form to make sure they released them before entering mirkwood. Lake town .....bard  was the captain of the guard and not a sad boatman. There was no wormy advising the lake town king.  They left no one back at lake town. The climax in smaugs hall... They didn't send bilbo In to find the arkenstone, they just sent him in to steal something. They would have to have the common sense enough with a huge hall about 10-15 feet deep with gold how would bilbo ever find the arkenstone? Bilbo was also the only one to go in, there was no chase scene with smaug chasing the dwarves all over the hall. Bilbo also kept the ring on almost the entire time he was in smaugs hall and didn't take it off because it was evil and whispered him. The ring had so much to do with the book because bilbo wore it a lot but it didn't so dumb things like whisper or mess up his vision. It seems they spent too much time on crap they made up and not enough time on things that were in the book like beorn.  I still give it 2 stars because the special effects are great but tries too hard to be like lord of the rings. It just feels like the movie had so much potential but the director/writers ruined it by making too much of it up. I hate to any it but I doubt I'll waste $10 to see the next one right when it comes out, I'll wait til it gets to the dollar theater.",1401062400,2,2581,4.1272365805168985

Let me give you some context, however. 1) I am a huge LOTR fan - both the books and the movies.  I thought the first three movies were fantastic. I've watched them many times. 2) As my wife will attest, I have a low threshold for what I will consider a good (or at least decent) movie.  Said differently, I am not terribly discriminating. I like most movies.  And yet, I hated this movie on so many different levels.

First, far too much of the movie is so digitally done that it looks like you're watching a video game.

Second, even the parts with real people are filmed in such a way as to be horribly unnatural.  I can't even articulate it exactly. It's like everything was super crisp with high contrast, unnaturally lit and then the movement was just weird.  I think I heard they used a much different speed of camera on this.  I don't know what it was, but I hated, hated, hated it.

Third, just like with the first Hobbit movie, this film is only minimally and loosely true to the book, with loads and loads of completely made up crap thrown in.  Tolkien wrote a great book.  Peter Jackson has ruined it.

If you like watching video games, horribly weird filming styles and loads of fantasy violence, then perhaps you will like this.  If you're thinking about watching this because you liked LOTR, just don't. You will hate it.",1400889600,24,1426,4.3522727272727275

The Movie: I know that I'm going to purchase this movie again on Blu-ray  when the extended version is released but I couldn't wait and had to own it now.  There have been a lot of negative reviews about this francize but I love both the 1st movie in this trilogy, as well as, this one.  The first movie was a slower paced than this one because it was a foundation builder thus allowing this one to be filled with tons of thrills, excitement and action.  Both movies are a fantasy lovers dream.  I read the book after seeing the 1st movie in this trilogy and realized that if they had adhered any more closely to the book these movies would have been a gigantic snooze fest.  Don't get me wrong, I like the book and understand that it is a children's book but I like the movies better. I felt the same way about the Narnia francize, read the 1st book  after seeing the movie; liked it but liked the movies better.  I will never tire of spending time in middle earth but, alas, it must end.  Guess, I'll just have to go to New Zealand which, by the way, is truly ""Middle Earth.  The footage of New Zealand in the Hobbit & LOTR movies and the extras is beyond breathtaking.

The Blu-ray format:
I like the combination of the DVD & Blu-ray but I wish these companies would simply quit including the Ultra-violet as an excuse to charge more.  It's insulting and, like most consumers,I never use it besides from the reviews that I've read it isn't user friendly anyway.  The price here was better than Walmart and Best Buy's and plus there were no sales tax and my shipping was free because this item was purchased with other items.  The Blu-ray picture and sound quality is superb.  At times, the picture is so vivid and crisp that it seems like I could reach out and touch the on screen image. There are no extras on this product, which I knew, but I  am still very happy with my purchase.  I've already watched it several times.

Tauriel is not in the original story but Evangeline Lilly is stunning and fits the part. Hey if Jackson can change the story of ""The Two Towers"" and still pull it off, I guess he can do the same with The Hobbit (and he depicted Radagast with a sled instead of a horse).

Alas, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" proved that I had just cause to have been concerned several years ago.  The movie starts without so much as a hint as to what occurred in ""An Unexpected Journey"" and left me scratching my head as to where it was in the book.  The action scenes were pretty much what you would expect with today's technology.  However, much of the dialogue made no sense, and some of the city scenes looked as though they were lifted from ""The Wizard of Oz.""  The totally abrupt ending was the coup de grce.  While I recognize that individual segments of a trilogy do not necessarily have to stand alone, I feel that ""The Desolation of Smaug"" would have been better served by a more graceful conclusion.

There were times when the movie seemed to drag, but all in all, it represented the main essence of the part of the book it was depicting.

While this is not an elegant review of the movie it is right on the money.  Without the on and on battles with the arrows through the head and the heads off with the swords the running time would have been seriously reduced and frankly it just got boring and repetitive.  The animation and special effects with the dragon are very good and the story line with Lake Town, less the female elf, is more or less constant with the book, BUT the soup is getting fairly thin.  Any more movies in this franchise are suffering for actual story to tell.  The movie is alright, the photography/animation is good, the acting is about as good as you can get considering the content and characterization, the plot is scattered with no real attempt to connect the various subplots and some of the characters pop on to the screen with little development of why or how, i.e. the two wizards.

I found THE HOBBIT- both 1 & 2 - disappointing because the SGI in the movie was over-the-top and honestly, not that good. This was a well made movie but not a labor of love as the first three films - and it shows. It reminded me of George Lucas's attempt at the STAR WARS prequels in that they felt forced and unnatural. For example, in THE TWO TOWERS, Peter Jackson had a multitude of actors portray the orcs which I felt added to the richness of the film and made it real to the audience. In THE HOBBIT a majority of the monsters are animation and SGI characters. There was a fight scene when the dwarves are escaping the elves when Legolas basically becomes a video game animation figure. Seriously, how could they do that?  It was very obvious and it changes the feel of the movie. I couldn't enjoy it because I knew that it could have been so much better. The quality of the film was good but does meet the bar that Jackson set with the triology. If only they had taken the time as they did with the triolgy....

As for the story, I loved it! I loved the dwarves and watching the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and Gandolf. It was a pleasant opportunity to visit with old friends and meet a few new ones.",1400630400,,1325,4.233201581027668

Not so with this episode.

As for the purists who harp on and on about throwing in the strong woman elf as a major story line and character: get over it. Jackson has taken not just The Hobbit, but all of Tolkien's associated writings, and thrown it all into a marvelous mix of adventure and characters that just brings Middle Earth alive.

4633464,3,B0059XTU3G,"The jist of this one? A lightweight fantasy trifle with an all-world effects budget and a seriously inflated sense of self-worth. There's a classical adventure formula stuffed snugly at the core of this letterbox behemoth, but it's so thoroughly entrenched in a world of fluff and fat that it can sometimes be difficult to keep in view. A certain degree of self-indulgence for the sake of fan service and depth can be excused. In fact, The Hobbit's light moments of fancy are where it has the most fun, showing off the strange little touches and quirks that make Middle Earth the puzzling, appetizing realm it truly is. At some point it's time to cut to the chase, though, and like a drunken slacker on holiday, this picture often hasn't the willpower to heed that call. For a hundred-thirty minutes it lingers, drowning its audience with padding, and just as the getting's finally getting, er, got... we slam headfirst into a flat black wall dubbed ""to be continued."" It has its strengths: the aforementioned visuals are a true revelation, the cast is wildly varied and dazzlingly colorful, and the dragon at the center of it all is truly awe-inspiring, a sight well worth seeing. The weaknesses, however, are just as numerous: most of the action scenes are carried-away bits of unreal CGI madness, it's overloaded with cameos and redundant, over-acted characters, and the constant pacing issues are downright crippling. As daydreams go, it's magnificent. A complete story it isn't, though, and it's rife with holes and faults.

However, the greatest message in this film was that it was the hobbits purity of heart that made him a winner, and not the ring itself.

Finding the Lord of the Rings trilogy masterfully (for the most part) adapted to the screen, I was eager to see how the prequel would fare. Sure, Peter Jackson took poetic license with LotR - but with the Hobbit, he makes a 90-degree turn and plows blissfully away from Tolkien's classic. Among his most egregious flights of fantasy: the inclusion of a non-canon female elf character - Tauriel - who is constantly on screen - eye candy for the boys, role model for the girls, an intellectual sparring partner for Legolas (Legolas?) and a love interest for one of the dwarves (I know, I know). Then there's Radagast the Brown, who becomes a semi-major player from a book that merely mentioned him by name. But hey, the dude can really pack away the mushrooms and ""herbal tobacco. Or Thranduil, the Wood Elf king; while played with passion and skill by the actor, revealing some of the roots of the hatred and mistrust between elves and dwarves, it's pure filler. Those who have not read the book will enjoy this film much more than those who have - the two have very little in common. My guess would be that, with LotR, Jackson had three books' worth of ""meat"" to build his movies; with the Hobbit, he had only one. Perhaps with the Hobbit, only one film was warranted; two at the most. Tolkien's wonderful work is stretched thin to the point of transparency, and Jackson has proven that he values ticket sales above anything else. Shame.",1400371200,2,1493,4.574626865671642

4633546,3,B0059XTU3G,"The story: This particular part of of the Hobbit trilogy  is 50% filler. The book parts feel a bit rushed while the filler is stretched out. The book was also comedy, & there is a distinct lack of it.  Apparently they plan to stretch the last 5 minutes of the book into a 3ed movie, as I easily could have been wrapped up here.

The CG quality is dreadfuly inconsistent: Smaug & the landscapes look very good, the Orcs look terrible, the liquid gold looks  dreadful, the melting statue was so bad I laughed. I won't say the CG is cartoonish, but it felt like a few living beings walking through a video game world. Even the stunts felt phoned in.

Legoas: His personality is not consistent with the LoTR books or movies. Also, I quickly grew tired of watching him stab things, which is pretty much much all he does.

Dwarves: For the most part they look fantastic & do a great job of acting. Thorin barely looks like a Dwarf, Kili looks nothing like one. They're also far too tall, all of them.

Orcs: Bad CG aside, I hate the way they read their lines; a truly hammy delivery.

Tauriel: Kudos for actually giving her an Sindarin name. She's pretty cool with the action, but it's insulting that she is used for forced romantic tension. Her character did not need to be romantic, this story does not need romance.

The romantic subplot: Nonexistent in the book. The thing between Kili & Tauriel raises too many questions; namely when you consider what male Elves & female Dwarves look like, how can they possibly find eachother attractive? You could point out Beauty & the Beast or Gargoyles, but those were relationships very slowly built on bonding & personality, not love at first sight. Secondly, it's pointless to imply that Legolas ever took interest in a woman when we all know he never marries or has children & spends god knows how long traveling with his best bro Gimli, whom also never marries or has children.

Thranduil: Pure eyecandy. Should have had more screen time.

Gandalf: He's barely in this movie.

Smaug: Excellent voice, nice design. Talks way too much, mostly spewing exposition that absolutely everyone is already aware of (both characters & audience). Rather cheesy dialogue.

Music: The song at the end doesn't fit with the feel of the movie.

Beorn: In the movie so little, I almost forgot about him entirely. At first I mistook his bear form for a crappy Warg model; not very good CG there.

Bard: No complaints; Good acting, good character development.

Singing: The first movie had singing, the book had singing, the Rankin Bass version had singing. It feels rather unhobbity without it.",1400284800,5,2618,4.671023965141612

They messed this story up with too much CG action, they tried so hard to impress it was just an overly dark, hard to watch mess.. ....seriously, I had to turn it off & come back later to watch.. 3 times.....it felt shallow in overall depth & so it fell largely flat, bordering on the side of things boring.
It left the aftertaste of a fast food feast...filling, yet unsatisfying....too much hype, imagery & Hobbit hoopla.
I wager the reason for fast paced foolishness is they believe the majority of viewers suffer from abbreviated attention spans, so will gush gleefully over such frenetically paced storytelling.
At best, it is worth renting just to satisfy curiosity.

So much of this movie was to set the stage for dwarves in barrels bobbing down the river that there must be an amusement park ride tied into the deal.  I thought that perhaps this part of the franchise was farmed out to a lesser director but no.  It has a feel of someone having picked up scraps that were edited out of the other movies and just stapled all of them together for this POS movie.,1400198400,3,483,4.052631578947368

This wasn't one time but the ENTIRE movie for me. I would highly recommend saving your money and just watch the last movie if you have read the book because it will probably emphasize the battle of five armies (nations)?

4633711,5,B0059XTU3G,From the music to cinematography this second installment builds upon the first chapter in a very satisfying manner.  Sure Tolkein purists may scoff at the placement and importance of Azog and Bolg but we are talking about a film adaptation here.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and have viewed it many times since purchasing it through Amazon.  I did not purchase a physical copy as I am sure there will be a trilogy boxed set or special edition once all three films are out.  Very good use of your entertainment dollar as a rental or purchase even if you are not a die-hard fantasy buff.,1399939200,2,581,4.5576923076923075

4633724,4,B0059XTU3G,"Like most everyone I was bored out of my mind by the first installment of the Hobbit.  It moved at a seemingly glacial pace, and by the time anything did happen it was just too late for me to care.  Fortunately this movie (part 2 of 3) moves along at a much faster pace with very few slow parts to drag it down.  From giant spiders to barrel rapids to Smaug himself the running time blows by and it's genuinely enjoyable.  Parts of it get a little silly of course (some of the barrel chase is far too ridiculous, though mostly it's a delightful sequence--my younger children adored this part) but they are quick and hardly noticeable.  The 'new' female elf is actually a nice addition to the story and is played well by Evangaline Lily.  Most characters motivations are fleshed out a bit more than they were in the book as well.

Jackson is pretty clearly making a 'prequel' trilogy to Lord of the Rings, so hints about what's to follow and the origin of Sauron are in here as well.  At the end of the day it's all about the dragon, though, and this movie delivers in spades.  Smaug is an achievement--probably the coolest dragon ever put on film (at least since Dragonslayer anyway) and the (very much fleshed-out from the book) sequences are a sight to behold. They are easily the best part of the movie.  The worst thing about the movie is the (to be expected) very abrupt ending, which will lead directly into the next part.  I knew it was coming but it still hurt to know that's where it was going to end.  Bring on the Five Armies!",1399939200,,1537,4.373239436619718

4633766,5,B0059XTU3G,"I'll breakdown this in few parts: What this blu ray package has, the hullabaloo about extended editions and finally about the movie itself: Hope this helps answer any queries you might have about ""Hobbit"".

1. THE BLU RAY PACKAGE: Total 5 discs
The 3D Blu ray (movie in 3D is split across 2 discs)
Regular Blu ray (2D): 1 disc
Special features: 1 blu ray disc (Peter Jackson takes you to set (HD; 41 min), Production videos (HD), a brief overview of New-Zealand as middle earth, Trailers and Previews (about 12 min), Music video of song ""I see fire"", and other stuff.
Movie on DVD (1 disc)

2. THEATRICAL vs EXTENDED:
As with Lord of the Rings, each ""Hobbit"" will also come in extended editions (where the movie will contain additional footage, AND there will be a heap of extra features. The release dates of those are (previously released and forthcoming):
Hobbit 1 (An Unexpected Journey) Theatrical: April 2013
Hobbit 1 (An Unexpected Journey) Extended: November 2013
Hobbit 2 (Desolation of Smaug) Theatrical: April 2014 (THIS IS THE RECENT RELEASE FOR WHICH I AM WRITING THE REVIEW)
Hobbit 2 (Desolation of Smaug) Extended: November 2014
Hobbit 3: To be Announced. Most likely the theatrical blu ray will be released in April 2015! Not sure about extended release.

Should I buy this or wait till November 2014?
Well, if you love the movie and like to see more of it, and more importantly, if you love to see hours of behind the scenes, production details, etc, then wait till November 2014. If you are happy with this regular version of the movie and don't want too many behind the scenes, then go for this.

3. THE MOVIE
First thing first. The movie DOES NOT follow the book page-by-page. Jackson have made some radical changes in the story, and these differences are more prominent in Hobbit 2 (Desolation of the Smaug) than in Hobbit 1. I am sure you have got an fair idea of these, however, I read many reviews and the more it is criticized, the more confusing it can get to the reader. Here I have tried to summarize those differences. Hope this helps:
1. ORCS: This is the single biggest addition to the story, which alters from the book. Orcs don't exist in book, and hence, wherever they are in the movie, it is an addition/change. This itself will count a big change.
2. MIRKWOOD: This part has been cut short, whereas in the book it's more elaborate.
3. LEGOLAS & TAURIEL: They don't exist in book, so does everything they do in the movie.
4. DWARVES ENTRY INTO LAKE-TOWN: I won't spoil the details, but Bard doesn't play a role in this (as depicted in film).
5. DWARVES ENTRY INTO THE MOUNTAIN: Durin's day, Appearance of the door, etc is changed.
6. SMAUG'S FINAL ACTION SCENE: Doesn't exist in book.
7. NECROMANCER & RADAGAST: Have only a mention in book. (Re: Necromancer, the book DOES say in the end that Gandalf drove Necromancer away as an explanation of his absence. So, I feel this is not truly an addition. Simply an expansion)
There. That would be all of it. I am pretty sure fans of the book have much more to say (and there are many who have already assessed this well), but in my opinion, the above summary contains all those details (as sub-topics). Nevertheless, the books vs. movie disparities end here.

BOOK vs. MOVIE Summary:
Hobbit 2 takes multiple liberties from the actual story. However, all those changes do one thing in common: ADD ACTION. How this affects you? Well, If you already know the book, and you like the on-screen Hobbit to be same as book's, you might be disappointed.
However, if you watch the movie with a blank slate, then it is a THRILL RIDE. I for one watched the movie without getting into the book and I loved it. I didn't think anything was out of place. The story has a very consistent flow and it is fun to watch.
The book is a very simple, brilliantly written classic story, whereas the movie ""Hobbit"" is far grandeur. It's huge, and encompasses many things beyond what is in the book.

Prequel of LOTR?
Finally, as I assess, I feel Peter Jackson has presented ""Hobbit"" not just as a book adaptation, but it is more focused as a ""prequel of LOTR"". There are few reasons to conclude this way:
a) The RING: In the book, The Ring is merely a simple magical ring that makes folks invisible. However, the movie puts serious emphasis on it. The ring has been in focus, and there are scenes where it has a treacherous effect on Bilbo.
b) Galadriel, Saruman: There is a scene (Hobbit 1) where these sit together and discuss about Sauron being vanquished, etc. The book has no reference to Sauron (LOTR was written after Hobbit's success).
c) Orcs, Necromancer: They exist in movie as servants to the ""Necromancer"" (Depicted as Sauron, without his full strength). This probably is an attempt to show that Sauron (before LOTR happened), was trying to make a comeback. Orcs exist as Sauron's army. It all fits.
So, Hobbit, can be viewed as a trilogy on its own, but it could be best viewed as a marathon (Hobbit 1, 2, 3 followed by LOTR trilogy). However, this will hold true only after the final Hobbit movie is released.

I like to stay in the Middle earth created by Jackson, and I love the way he arranges the action scene (LOTR, King Kong, etc.). Some deem the action in ""Hobbit 2"" as video-gamish. For me, even if some sequences defy few basic rules of physics, it is thrilling to see them on-screen (The Barrel escape, Smaug's final act). Hence, I wholeheartedly recommend this. If for nothing else, at least for the magnificent ""Smaug"", one hell-of-a-kind, stupendous dragon ever made on sceen!
In short, if you like both book and film, then you have two versions of the same story to enjoy. Want simple and unadulterated fun? Read BOOK. Want spectacular visuals, thrilling action scenes and additional bonus material? Go for the MOVIE. I personally enjoy both rather than spending time in comparing them.

The first movie was interesting but not great.  The second movie is just unbearable.  It was slow, confusing, dark, boring, and felt a like a ""B"" movie.  It would have been better if Peter Jackson took the time to really develop the plot, characters, and the settings.  Also, Thorin character is really annoying, as every time he talks it sounds like he's giving someone a lecture or trying to sell you something.

As a person who has read the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit 8 times or so and Peter Jackson being the directer of HEAVENLY CREATURES, the comedic ultraviolent horrorshow that was DEAD ALIVE and the hardcore muppet porn MEET THE FEEBLES I shook my head in awe that he pulled off the awesomeness of the LORD OF THE RINGS. Unfortunately all my fears I had for the LORD OF THE RINGS came true in the first HOBBIT movie. I hated it with a capital H. I'm not sure how my arm got twisted into going to see the DESOLATION OF SMAUG, but it did. I was stunned, blown away, in awe once again. Peter Jackson made up for the garbage that the first HOBBIT movie was and made a sublime DESOLATION OF SMAUG. And really it boils down to the dragon himself, the magnificent mighty SMAUG. SMAUG is how a dragon should be, the greatest onscreen dragon, period. The banter between Smaug and Bilbo is classic. And the last two lines of dialogue in the movie, spoken by Smaug, awesome.

I can't wait to see the last movie, the BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES or whatever its going to be called. So if you hated the first HOBBIT movie, as well you should, as much as you might have hated it, you'll at least like this movie if not love it.",1399852800,,1268,4.2181069958847734

4633802,2,B0059XTU3G,"""The Hobbit"" was a short book, and a very engaging story.  It should have been translated to the screen in absolutely no more than two parts.  The somewhat interesting part of this movie ALMOST began about the time the closing credits rolled.  I will not be watching the third installment of this series.

I read The Lord of the Rings trilogy a number of times when I was young, and enjoyed the full-length (not theatrical release) versions of the movies so much I purchased the DVDs to watch over and over.  The story was three full length books that needed to be three full length movies, and only watch the long versions or you'll be confused with the story.  I read the books and couldn't follow along in the theater.  THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG could have been put in the middle of a single movie without losing much except drudgery.",1399766400,2,847,4.532894736842105

The development of the characters, the background of Erebor, the White Council, the King of the Woodland elves, etc. adds to the rich tapestry of the story rather than detracts from it (in my opinion, anyway) I have been a fan of Tolkien since 1963 when I first read the Hobbit at the age of 9; I only wish that the novel ""Lord of the Rings"" was 6 movies for the ""6 books"" :)",1399766400,,519,4.2

4633852,2,B0059XTU3G,"My wife & I have been looking forward to watching this at home for months.  We are dedicated Tolkien enthusiasts, overall quite impressed with Peter Jackson's handling of Tolkien's oeuvre.  I'm not a purist -- I don't object to creative departures from source material, as long as those departures are based on some sensible rationale and sustain a measure of tonal consistency.  ""An Unexpected Journey"" took some liberties but nothing stood out as glaringly obtuse.  ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" alas, is where Peter Jackson wanders into the proverbial Mirkwood and never returns (reminiscent of his ""King Kong"" treatment in all the wrong ways).

Clearly, they wanted to make the film as contemporary as possible.  By ""contemporary"" I mean replete with cartoonish combat and camp, awash if not drowning in computer graphics.  My eight year old son got some laughs out of the interminable barrel ride sequence, but my wife and I were rolling our eyes and trying to stifle the yawns.  Over the course of the film, we witness a dozen or so orc decapitations -- their heads being far too easily severed from their bodies, and far too cleanly.

There's just nothing here to make you CARE about the characters, despite Thorin Oakenshield's personality being transformed from grumpy old self-righteous curmudgeon to the second coming of Aragorn (complete with curly shiny long locks and breathy speeches delivered to his one-dimensional companions).

Lake-town -- for no discernible reason -- is depicted with something of a Nordic palate, and the tenor of the town is a bizarre mix of Dickens and J.K. Rowling's Muggles.  Bard's personality and loyalties are more meandering and unpredictable than the Colorado, when I always pictured him as a calm and confident bowman (not a dwarf-smuggling bargeman).  Here, they are setting him up to use some sort of Dwarven ballista-like contraption to take Smaug down.  WHY?

The more I think and write about it, the more this film doesn't even seem to deserve two stars, but I did experience some enthusiasm when they finally reached the side of Lonely Mountain and Smaug engaged Bilbo in conversation.  The madcap fight/chase sequence that ensues, however, had me thinking that Tolkien must surely be rolling over in his grave at this atrocity.

Perhaps this is because, compared to the LOTR trilogy, I have found the Hobbit movies, and The Desolation of Smaug in particular, quite wanting.  I will give several reasons which range form character to plot to effects, but by no means is the description exhaustive.  The FX were okay, though a bit hyperbolic, and often too obvious.  I enjoy fantasy, yet some of the scenes and scenarios defy physics in a way I found difficult to stretch my imagination to accept.  Bilbo is supposed to be the hero, yet he is basically a secondary character in this movie - that bothers me tremendously.  The hero's journey is the main element with which the viewer is meant to associate!  I found my self waiting for a climax in this movie, a resolution to the second plot point (whatever that was - perhaps entering the dragons lair), yet it did not occur.  (Indeed, the plot points were ill defined throughout.)  Rather, I am found waiting for the last movie in the trilogy to find a resolution to the second movie, and additionally one to an unfocused conflict that has been ill developed.

This move was simply not self contained.  Granted, the LOTR trilogy was one big story, but each of its movies stood on its own.  Thus far, the Hobbit movies have failed at this.

They should have just stuck with the book's plot.  This Hobbit series has been very disappointing.",1399593600,,1501,4.552238805970149

Some was from the Silmarillion (I have a first edition, first printing) and it gives those who haven't read the books some background on what led up to this epic.

The action and intensity is ratcheted up a notch and the appearance of the long-awaited dragon Smaug is the highlight of the show. Many new developments in the plot come about, and most of course are left to be solved with the release of the final movie. Also, many of the characters have developed since the first movie, and we are introduced to new faces (and familiar ones like Legolas!) as well.

The Hobbit is a small book, a fun read, but like the first installment of the series this movie is loaded with bloat and new characters whose only purpose is to extend the running time. Pretty much all the characters are unlikable, especially Bilbo Baggins, who is a humorless bore in this production. In fact, none of the good natured humor in the book is present.
  Beorn really got short shift. He is a lot more interesting in the book. And Gandalf's adventures here are a pointless aside, an attempt to link these movies with the Lord of the Rings series.
  I thought the movies The Lord of the Rings were a real improvement on the books. This is quite the opposite, and should have been done with two movies at the most, not three.",1399420800,,770,4.401408450704225

The statues were shipped to me directly from WB and they arrived broken, so I returned the whole set, the new set they sent me arrived broken too. The Collector edition set comes with a very poor design for shipping, the heavy statues are kept in place by two rigid plastic belts that break so easy allowing the statues to move and buckle and because the statues although heavy they are made of rigid plastic too, not polystone they may arrive broken too, especially at the dwarven axe.

4634079,5,B0059XTU3G,"Update March 2015:
Amazon won't let me rate the DOS Extended edition w. collector barrel rider figure separately, so I am editing this review to say I am so happy with the quality of the sculpt of the barrel rider figure included with the Amazon Exclusive that I ordered a second one. IMO it's that good, and I noticed that the few sets available by WETA itself are now gone. Gary Hunt of WETA sculpted this work, and WETA has just released an outstanding sculpt of Faramir by this artist - e.g., at this scale, and for this barrel rider figure, the likeness of Thorin, Bilbo, and Kili is stellar, with unbelievable detail and nice paint job - the wrinkles of wet cloth, the expressions - even the tiny little noses and clothing are screen accurate. There's even water in the barrels. Plus there is kind of a vitality and energy about this little piece - I can only completely agree with YouTube reviewer Mark Rivera on the great quality of this collector piece. At this price point it's an amazing piece of work. I wasn't expecting much as these kind of figures are often blobby and poorly painted, with horrible expressions and so on - like cheap figure toys - but I just love this - pictures don't do it justice. Hate to say it, but I think this little Thorin looks more like Thorin, in its way, than the ""real"" WETA Thorin figure (different sculptors, so that's probably why). Figure seems to be of highly detailed resin - even the water looks real.

There's enough details about the DOS EE scenes that I won't say much, but the EE is WELL WORTH THE PRICE. Just seeing the dwarves LOL scuffle at Laketown was a delight, never mind more Beorn, more Mirkwood! IMO for the DOS EE, the Amazon barrel collector set is the way to go, if you like memorabilia. 10 stars + for the Amazon exclusive barrel rider set!

ORIGINAL review:
The Hobbit movies vaulted themselves into being my favorite movies of all time - personally love what PJ did, the richness of the costumes, sets, locations, the fleshing out of the original story. Most of all the strength of the performances by a stellar cast of actors, IMO lead by the fierce haunting performance by Richard Armitage as Thorin, and Martin Freeman's stellar Bilbo. So I couldn't wait to get my hands on the DOS BluRay.

As far as the BluRay, which is the only thing I've watched in this set so far along with the Special Features, on my Samsung TV couldn't be more delighted with the image quality - IMO the crispness, the nuances of color - of course I enjoyed the film in an IMAX theater (more than once) but it's also been wonderful to see so much detail, up close and personal. My only quibble is I wish like the European disks there would be movie scenes or artwork on the disks themselves - it just adds to the pleasure even if it ""doesn't really matter since the disk is in a player"". I can only assume the 3D version is equally good, when I have a system to watch it.

So for me hands down the BR and the movie gets a 10. Where the collector set falls off, unfortunately, for me, is the *bleep* bookends. Don't get me wrong, as a dwarf/Thorin fan, I REALLY wanted these bookends. A little piece of Erebor for a book lover!.
As a collectible, they don't suck, the design of the stone dwarf guards is accurate, and they are some sort of heavy resin plastic. But I ordered 2 different sets, thanks to Amazon's wonderful return policy ended up with three of this ""limited edition"" and every single one of them had a flaw of some kind. It's not Amazon's fault, as one of the sets was from another company.

These are sloppy production flaws, everything from blobby features from someone pulling a statue from a mold too fast, to the axes - which evidently are not part of the casting - just snapping off. One of the statues had a cheek guard snapped off. And I don't think this is the shipping, as the bookends are strapped in and encased in heavy, ecologically incorrect form-fitting plastic plus the whole thing was shipped padded. I think it's Noble co. trying to get away with a ""good enough"" job (I've bought their stuff before) using an indifferent Made in China! *sigh* manufacturer/packer. The painting/color of the figures is OK, I could see someone repainting for appeal tho - kind of an army khaki or something like that.

So much for the hype over a limited edition collectible - minus one, as of course one of my 3 sets is heading back to Amazon, who I hope returns to Noble. Well, OK, when I think about it, guess it's about $25 per figure, which is kind of reasonable. I guess. But this isn't one of the Hobbit pens or keychains (which are fine) or letter openers, I was hoping they'd be really nice. And the bookend details ARE very clean and sharp - as long as more care was used, which it wasn't. Overall unless you are a Hobbit movie junkie like me, I'd say just get the BluRay and save dollars and buy a pricey collectible from the ""ultimate source"" WETA, who did the costumes and sets for the movies themselves. Or wait for a big sale on this bookend edition.

As for Noble company, well, re Hobbit collectibles they seem to do a ""good enough"" job - for instance I have an Erebor key paperweight, but they used the same mold front and back, so you get mirror reverse runes on one side. And the diamond end of the key is just glued in, e.g. the whole thing wasn't cast, just put together for a ""good enough"" job. Unless you look hard. But what goes around - I was thinking of buying Thorin's sword ""Deathless"" which at the moment only Noble makes a replica of. And my bookend experience has decided me in NOT buying any expensive collectible from Noble like a sword replica (as opposed to the wonderful job United Cutlery did with the Orcrist replica). As it is, I'm going to handle my bookends carefully, including regluing the axe that had fallen off in the box. Which it wouldn't have if the manufacturing had been better - a shame.",1399334400,2,5904,4.425942962281509

Well done and the package met my expectations. The movie appears to be the theatrical version (although I can't confirm), and there are a number of special features available.

Martin Freeman is still pleasing - to a point.  Evangeline Lily is interesting - but what is it with Kili?  Seriously???  WHAT???

The movie took such a boring turn that I fell asleep sometime after Legolas' first stint of hopping around being a tough elf and when I woke up about 20 minutes later and saw that he was still the main focus, I just lost interest and gave up on it...never finished it. I'm just not a big Orlando Bloom fan. I think he should only be allowed to play in really silly parts like Pirates of the Caribbean. I just can't take him seriously and didn't like the elf king much either. To me, the movie lost all of it's momentum when the wood elves come into it.
I realize we're talking fantasy in the first place, but at least most of the other characters help transport you to the right place...not Legolas for me. I mean, really...that skinny little guy wouldn't even be able to pull enough draw weight on a bow to shoot an arrow with enough velocity to penetrate the skin of an Orc.

4634255,5,B0059XTU3G,"The first Hobbit was a (pretty)good movie. But for those of you that where disappointed when comparing the film to the original LOTR trilogy, The Hobbit The Desolation Of Smaug is the film for you.
The Hobbit 2 is a great return to form for the middle earth franchise. It't fixes all the mistakes of it's predecessor, from more action to better pacing to including more of the heart and epicness of the original films.
One thing that made this film great is it takes us to new areas of Middle Earth that we didn't know existed. The biggest example is Lake Town, which was so unlike anything we have seen in the last four films.
Peter Jackson does a good job at keeping the material fresh, especially considering that this is his 5th film in the series. At first, the spider scene felt repetitive, after LOTR 3, but he found ways to freshen it up. I was particularly impressed with the scene when Bilbo puts on the ring and hears all the spiders talking to each other.
I don't usually see movies in 3D, including the first film. This one I did, and it was unbelievable. At first, the whole fast moving thing left me less than satisfied. It was like watching a movie on FF 1.5. But once the action started, it got much better(visually).
But you haven't seen anything until Smaug comes in. The 3D effects for the whole last hour with Smaug blew me away. It was unlike anything I've ever seen on screen before in my life. I felt the same feeling moviegoers felt when they saw Star Wars back in 1977.
Also the cliffhanger was outstanding. The best part of the movie in my opinion. It leaves you 100% satisfied, yet at the same time, it guarantees that you will buy a ticket for the series finale this December. That Battle of The Five Army's. (That title has me very interested. I only read the first half of the book, so I didn't know there was a big war at the end. It seems that things are really going to escalate. I mean, all five corners of Middle Earth about to erupt in all out war. That seems somewhat bigger than a dragon burning sown a small town. This is in no way a criticism. This is just me being curious.)
Watching the bonus features sucks because it kills your imagination, but it also shows how much hard work goes into these films. I hope everyone involved on this project feels that all this hard work was worth it and I hope they know that the fans love what they have done and love them for doing it.",1399161600,,2417,4.325991189427313

4634257,2,B0059XTU3G,"Peter Jackson has turned The Hobbit into a dumb action movie loaded with terrible CGI action sequences.

Open barrels are completely submerged in rough water, but somehow stay afloat. Thorin uses a metal wheelbarrow to ride in a flow of molten gold, but somehow doesn't get burned. Smaug's fire breath passes within inches of the characters, hot enough to light the dwarven furnaces that had been dead for ages but apparently not hot enough to scorch even one hair on anyone. In fact, Smaug breathes enough fire to set a small country ablaze, but for all his efforts he only manages to set fire to one piece of clothing. Legolas executes physically impossible moves in CGI that look so ridiculous they spoil the entire sequence, and decides to get into a man-to-man fist fight with the Orc leader instead of just shooting him down with an arrow.

The scene where he chases the Orc over the bridge from Lake Town looks like something out of a 5-year old 3D computer game (actually, so does most of the CGI). The endless swinging from chains while engaging Smaug in a pointless battle. He can smell Bilbo even when he is invisible, but passes right over the top of all the dwarves without detecting them.

Come on, this is children's action. It's loud, it's over the top, it's poorly thought through and it's already boring and numbing to the senses before we're even halfway through the movie. There's no connection with the characters, they've just vehicles for showing off CGI, with no sense of them ever being in danger or any reason for us to care about them. Thorin in fact comes across as a bit of a tosser.

And then a dwarf and an elf, two races supposed to hate each other, falls in love at first sight.

I shudder to think of the amount of bad CGI we'll have to witness in the third installment with the war scenes. Imagine 3 hours of people falling hundreds of feet without so much as a scratch, of Legolas cutting down 50 orcs in close combat with his bow without a hand being laid on him. No thanks.

I have to admit though, Smaug was well realized. But he'll be dead soon. Thankfully so will this travesty called ""Peter Jackson's The Hobbit"".",1399161600,,2155,4.541237113402062

The special effects are fantastic, particularly Smaug.  Best Evil Dragon ever... but the intercourse between Bilbo and Smaug was very, very weak compared to the book.  The major flaws in this movie are the weak characters... Bilbo just seems to be there and really has no personality at all.  Gandolf, Ian McKellen's character just seems to go through the motions.  The dwarves don't come close to the personalities or look described in the book.  You can change a lot of things, just don't mess with the characters.

Smog is supposed to be so powerful and yet gets not one dwarf or hobbit in 20 minutes of chasing them and then runs off to get the lake men rather than finishing off the dwarfs and hobbit.  Silly.

The dwarf statues are fabulously designed: each scale on the armor and braid of hair is very much present in beautiful detail. They're *not* by Sideshow Weta (like the statuary from the Lord of the Rings limited editions were) but they're heavy and well-made. The only weak point on them are the axes, but that's only because they have only one connection point, stick out, and are more likely to be hit when you have them sitting out on display.

All the discs in it work as they're supposed to- 3D, Blu-ray, regular DVD, and UltraViolet download.

Definitely worth the price; Walmart has it cheaper but the majority of reviews state that most of theirs arrive broken. Curious! This was well packaged even without the airpacks for shipping, and with the way that the statues are packed in the box (double zip ties on each which have little sleeves over them to protect the bookends, molded packing top and bottom to hold everything away from them, and nothing even near the axes which are positioned to the more protected inside) the only way for them to arrive broken is if they were broken *before* shipping.

True, this section of the story required some padding and pumping up in order to translate well into film. I mean, you really wants to watch Thorin and Company wander aimlessly through the woods or float down a river stuffed inside barrels or cower on the side of a mountain? Not me. And I have to admit, I rather enjoyed the river battle. It was done quite well and was my favorite addition. But other additions were just absurd. It made for nice action, but the scene with Bilbo and the dragon...I actually groaned out loud, along with several other movie goers. I was hoping that would be left intact, but they ruined it when they threw in Thorin and Company. Really? Why change the views of Thorin and have him rush to Bilbo's aid? Because they wanted us to think we got our monies worth our $17.00 IMAX 3D tickets. They had to show off their wonderful effects and animations. It looked glorious, but still absurd and way over the top. And the most absurd thing of all was the ridiculous ""romance"" between Kili and What'shername. I mean...come on. Did I miss some nauseating part of an appendix that spoke of love between a dwarf and and elf other that Gimli and Legolas? And Legolas and his silent pining over What'shername and his implied jealousy. Why? Oh well. I should also mention the additional Gandalf scenes. They were also nice, but a little redundant. I would have liked to see Gandalf kick a little more orc butt. It was awesome to watch him fight the necromancer and learn it was Sauron though. I liked how the flaming eye's pupil was a walking imagae of Sauron. Beautifully done. And I must mention my disappointment of Beorn. I love that character and his part in the book but the movie made it so lackluster. I would have liked to see more of the fantastical elements of Beorn's home, not just pretty dappled ponies. So, long story short...great entertaining film. Some may groan at the additions and changes, but they will probably still enjoy the movie a great deal and sit twiddling their thumbs for the next film.",1398902400,,2135,4.621052631578947

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an exciting addition to the Jackson efforts to bring Tolkien's stories to life on the screen. The five disc package offers several hours of enjoyable story telling and is topped off with an excellent ""Special Features"" on Blu-Ray. While Peter Jackson may have taken some liberties with the story, they all seem to work well and help produce an enjoyable evening's entertainment for the fan of Middle Earth.

The Special Features disc has a lot of behind the scenes footage which helps the viewer to understand the objectives Peter Jackson had in mind as he directed the film. Although I didn't do this, it might almost be worth the time to watch the Special Features first as a sort of appetizer for the movie itself. After watching the Production Videos section I felt a strong desire to watch the movie again and see how all of these elements finally came together.

I've now watched all five discs and have found them a really lot of fun and encourage any Middle Earth fan to add this to their collection if they have not already done so. I'm looking forward to Part 3.",1398902400,2,1383,4.659836065573771

4634378,5,B0059XTU3G,"It was a good movie.  I actually enjoyed the first movie more, but we will see how it ends.  I liked how the plot deviated from the norm in order to provide more drama to the film for those who have read the story.  On the other hand, I was a little disappointed with the brevity of the  encounter with the spiders and the stay at Beorn's.  Also, I thought of Beorn as more of a quiet sort that could be suddenly irritable, not as dark and looming.  I miss the way in which Gandalf gradually introduced the dwarves and the understated humor between Beorn and the dwarves as they showed up in pairs.  Something else that I miss from the book iis the naughtiness of the orcs and goblins.  In the movies the orcs are always very serious and monstrous.  In the books they are wicked, but Gandalf compares them to naughty little children - which can be seen by their singing when they surround the adventurers (first movie) when they are trapped in the trees in the book.

The Lord of the Rings was also well done, but I feel like a lot of the light heartedness and beauty of Tolkein's world got left out with the omission of Tom Bombadil.  These omissions have rather cast a kind of shadow over the more enjoyable elements from the book.  I understand that edits must be made for a set of films of this scope. but I would have liked to have seen some more of these light hearted elements.

That isn't the case for Peter Jackson's version. Jackson adds much to the story that isn't there in the Tolkein version. There are a number of characters who aren't there in the book and events that never happened in the book. So if you expected Tolkein's Hobbit you'll be disappointed but if you want Peter Jackson's Hobbit based upon Tolkein's universe you will have a fun time. There is a lot of action and events, the story moves along at a faster pace than ""An Unexpected Journey"" and it really is enjoyable in it's own right. But it ain't the book.

Jackson may have found a lot of his additions in the later writings and notes of Tolkein but, to me at least, The Hobbit is a simple story and should be told simply. Yes the Universe it is set it may have become complicated and fleshed out later in Tolkein's life but The Hobbit itself is a story meant for the young and should have been filmed that way.

4634407,3,B0059XTU3G,"As with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I love the Hobbit. Great movies. The reason why I give it 3 of 5 stars is because when I purchased the Combo Pack (Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Download) what they do not say is that when it comes to the digital download part, you can ONLY download it through Flixster (the same for both Hobbit movies). I understand that Warner Bros. owns Flixster, that's fine, but at least give customers the choice of either downloading the digital copy through Flixster OR iTunes. Amazon too, should include that in their marketing info for The Hobbit combo pack. Those looking to download this movie through iTunes by getting this combo pack are out of luck. If you have an iPad, iPhone, etc. and have an iTunes account, you will have purchase this movie separately through iTunes. With Flixster (if you don't already have it) you have to download their app and register either through Google+ or Facebook.

So fair warning: If you don't want to deal with Flixster, don't bother getting the combo pack and just purchase the digital ""Smaug"" separately through iTunes.",1398816000,,1087,4.751322751322752

Although it differs from the book, the differences Peter Jackson clearly made to help connect the movie to the Lord of the Rings Epics. The storytelling is clear and the storyline more light than the Lord of the Rings, just as the book ""The Hobbit"" is lighter (due to being written for a younger reader). It was great to see Legolas (played again by Orlando Bloom) in his home environment. Martin Freeman continues to enhance the role of Bilbo and plays a very good Hobbit. It is great to continue to get to know the characters of the dwarves and of course Sir Ian McKellen continues to shine. The only down point was that Gollum was not in the movie, which of course was due to Gollum not being part of the story (and hence unable to be).

I thought Part I was okay, but not great.  Perhaps a bit slow and plodding along.  I was pleasantly surprised with Part II which, despite its length, moved along at a good pace. There was definitely some non-novel material inserted into the screenplay that added length, but at least it was seamless.  Overall, my impression parallels my thoughts on the LOR where I thought the Fellowship of the Ring was a bit slow but the Twin Towers was terrific.

4634530,4,B0059XTU3G,"There is one often missed aspect to successful movie franchises which keeps fans coming back- that of ""likability"". Generally, we tend to watch films more frequently if the lead characters have an emotional connection- and people (dwarfs) we ""like"" and want to spend an evening with. The issue with the Hobbit is the ""unlikable""nature of the lead dwarf. I know this isn't crucial to the plot, the visuals, or the storytelling- but I hope he is portrayed as something more than a bombastic, self centered, power hungry, driven, unlikable leader. Compare him to Aragon, Legolas or Gimlee- who would you rather invite into your home for a weekend movie marathon? Most will say this is beside the point, but it is a more important factor than most realize. Think about other leading movie stars in action adventure, fantasy or sci-fi films. Peter Jackson- please give this dwarf a heart- we simply don't ""know"" him, and thus we don't yet really care about him or his quest.",1398643200,,969,4.843373493975903

4634546,1,B0059XTU3G,"Any true JRR Tolkien fan who sees the movie will be disappointed. It has almost nothing to do with the book ""The Hobbit"" and much more to do with director Peter Jackson's sophomoric imagination. Stealing from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" he and his screenwriting cohorts have managed to mangle a sweet children's book into a dark, monster-filled gory mass of bad dialogue and simplistic story elements that are more akin to a nightmare than a genuine film. No doubt, Jackson knew he had enough non-Hobbit material to put together his own pathetic movie and did so, fueled on by the greed of movie executives involved. But this film has nothing to do with the book and can only be enjoyed by an immature crowd of viewers who prefer ""epic"" (the new word for cool) to a film of any substance whatsoever. My advice is to skip this one and hope Jackson actually includes some elements from the book in his final Hobbit film.",1398556800,7,915,4.585365853658536

What can I say, I'm a sucker for a Dragon and giant scenery. 4 stars may be a bit much - but I did not regret streaming the movie through Amazon.  I was bummed when our local movie store closed and have been reluctant to spend the extra 2 dollars to stream movies.

However, while each of the three Ring films was a conversion to film of three books, I do not care for the fact that they have apparently decided here to make three films out of the one book, the Hobbit.  Still, the filmmakers have done an awesome job converting Tolkein and his stories to film.  I am eagerly, albeit impatiently, awaiting the next installment of the Hobbit.",1398556800,,503,4.629213483146067
4634582,2,B0059XTU3G,"This movie takes everything that was wrong with it's predecessor and amplifies it about a hundredfold. We have even more gratuitous gravity-defying battle scenes haphazardly thrown in. More fan fiction-esque subplots. More Family Guy crude humor tastelessly thrown in to what is supposed to be either a serious epic or a kids movie(""I could have anything in my trousers"") it can't seem to decide which. The only good thing about the movie is Smaug and they even had to ruin that by having Bilbo take off his ring and have Smaug chase him and the dwarves in a ridiculous sequence.
Here's my prediction for the third movie:
The third installment of the Hobbit movie will now be called The Battle of Five Armies instead of There and Back Again. Peter Jackson said this was fitting since he really prefers filming massive impersonal battles over character development. The Battle of Five Armies will be filmed in three separate movies, each two and a half hours long. They will be shot entirely in slow motion and will feature entirely new characters created by Peter Jackson including Baug, Smaug's younger (and hotter) brother set out to avenge his Dragon kin. Aragorn will be in the movie for some reason, and Bilbo will also fall in love with Tuariel and the love triangle between her Kili and Legolas will become an inter-species love square.",1398556800,4,1343,4.843478260869565

Included in that one star is the lack of any levels of intelligent storytelling - just a one level script and that one level was pointless overdone and empty gratuitous violence (spearing Orcs through their eyes; cutting their heads off; etc.). Average - two stars.

They seem to be going overboard in selling the NZ scenery because I thought i was watching a travelogue - does the studio have holdings in NZ touristy money making?",1398470400,3,556,4.731958762886598
4634603,1,B0059XTU3G,"I was exhausted after viewing this film. It was a continuation of the first containing nearly non-stop chase and battle scenes with little or no respite between them. Major portions of the melees look as if they were choreographed by a Hong Kong kung foo martial arts film fight coordinator. Where is the story, character development and dialog? There's very little. What little dialog there is gets cheesy with heavy cues for the next round of violent melee (in the true meaning of the word, hand-to-hand combat). Example with Gandalf speaking to Bilbo, Oakenshield and the dwarves: ""You'll be safe here for the night! [under his breath to himself] I hope."" Much of the rest is overly melodramatic or much too heavily laden with platitudes. Next to final steps in stairways breaking away, bridges slowly collapsing, nearly dashing over the edges of precipices, and other potentially fatal missteps abound to the point of becoming very predictable as to when they will occur. The effort to keep the viewer cringing in abject fear for safety and continued survival of all main characters the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes misfires, making one numb and immune to it within the first 15 minutes. Cut the bloated melees and there's at most about a half-hour left of anything meaningful to the plot and Tolkien's story about Bilbo Baggins, if that much.

The adaptation of Tolkien's rather short novel could have and should have been done in a single film of perhaps 2 hours total run time. The rest is sheer bloat, a spectacular exercise in utterly unnecessary sound effects, special effects, stunts and CGI. The non-stop sensory barrage left me exhausted and numb afterward. If that wasn't bad enough, it lacks the self-containment each part of a trilogy ***should*** have, ending with a ""cliff-hanger."" This is an exceedingly cheap trick of the studios, producers and directors. This was NOT done with the first film, the LOTR trilogy, or in other examples such as Kill Bill (two-part). What this means is this film requires the third film for a self-contained story. It's yet another blatantly exposure of Peter Jackson's, the producers' and the studios' **only** motive for making a short novel into an enormously bloated trilogy as long as LOTR: box office revenue greed. What's pitched over the side in their quest for that is Tolkien's marvelous tale told in a whimsical manner that could be enjoyed by younger children, containing characters with depth, and greater exploration of the concepts of greed, selflessness, right vs wrong, and good vs evil. What we get is a film certainly nothing less than its PG-13 with its level of violence including several on-screen beheadings (by sword).

Buy the novel and read it instead. Far more enjoyable, and a story you can share with younger children by reading it to them. Tolkien must be rolling in his grave over these Hobbit films!",1398470400,13,2882,4.952479338842975

If you feel like the movies should not vary from the story in the books at all, and expect Peter Jackson to live up to his work in the LOTR series, prepare to be annoyed and disappointed.

Tolkien originally wrote The Hobbit: There and Back Again for children, and The Lord of the Rings for adults. Surprisingly, Peter Jackson stuck mostly to the plot in The Lord of the Rings, but then maybe that was because there were three books to the story and so much detail that he actually had to leave some things out. Not so with The Hobbit. There are many scenes that have been added to the original story, making it almost unrecognizable sometimes. There are many extra characters also, especially elves and orcs. I suppose I am a purist when it comes to movies made from beloved books. But all in all it wasn't bad, and for that I've given it four stars.

Then there's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, which I was originally sad to miss seeing in the theaters, but now after watching it on Amazon Instant Video, I am so disappointed! The book is so good and really doesn't need to be changed. The exchange between Bilbo and Smaug is about how Bilbo outwits him. It's part of Bilbo's journey! How can they completely rewrite the story like this? I expected a little straying from the book, but not this extent of added characters and plots, while leaving out huge chunks from the book. And while I'm all about action movies, I was truly bored while the dwarfs were fighting Smaug and kept waiting for them to get back to the real story. Now I probably won't bother seeing the third installment in the theater either since it's no longer the movie I wanted to see. I was hoping to see The Hobbit, as written by Tolkien, not Jackson.

Aside from those, I found the CGI completely ludicrous in the barrel scene, more like something you'd see 10 years ago, with impossible movements from characters and a general softness to all aspects that were ""worked"" on. It was so bad it made me want to stop watching, despite the fact I paid money to rent this movie.

Clearly all the money went to making Smaug seem real, and that was well done. It seems as if Smaug could exist and Martin Freeman does a good job of acting against what must have been an enormous green screen.

4634769,4,B0059XTU3G,"I have been a Tolkien fan for decades. I think I read ""The Hobbit"" for the first time almost exactly 50 years ago. I've read it at least 10 times. I rather liked the first installment which came out in 2012, and I expected that like the second LOTR installment, the second Hobbit installment would be an improvement over the first. I have not made a final judgment, but I can say with certainty that it was no improvement over part 1. It compressed the scenes where there was relatively little action, such as the stay at Beorn's house and the trek through Mirkwood, and the journey by boat up to the Lonely Mountain, and expanded other scenes which had a lot of action, for example the encounter with the giant spiders, the barrel spillway scene, events in Laketown, and of course, the encounter with Smaug. That last part I can appreciate, since the appearance of Smaug I anticipated as the real highlight. Smaug is as fearsome as Tolkien made him out to be. The scene is longer, but what seems to have been missed is the repartee between Smaug and the invisible Bilbo, who takes his ring off long before it happens in the novel.

I also miss Radagast, who makes only a brief appearance, as Gandalf explores Dol Guldur, a footnote to the original story, which the screenwriters are building into a bigger connection with the rise of Sauron. It's quite good, but not ""great"" which is an adjective I would use to describe ""The Two Towers"" in the LOTR series.

We thought that this would be fine because of the aforementioned 30 day time period.  So, just to be aware that when it says 30 days it really means 24 hours.

If you don't like it when things are not exactly the same as in the book you won't like the movie.  I loved the scenery and I think that the cities that it presented were well thought out and true to the image I had of them. The Dragon Smaug was magnificent and terrifying.

Evidently Peter Jackson felt that he needed to create another trilogy for his resume.  The storyline which should have been quickly told for this part was elongated.  Beor the changling is altered and is rather less than what he was in the book.  The journey through Mirkwood is quickly gone through without a greater explaination as to what is happening, I understand that this is a hard sell and comes to a good explaination but still something is unsatisfied.  The part where the dwarves are captured first by spiders and then by elves is altered so that the tale begins like the last movie to get mangled.  A portion of the movie is given to a heroine and some to explanation of other events.  Some of this other explanation is good but it is pure make believe.  The Laketown changes are likewise small but begin to give the movie a mangled shape from the book.  The movie is turned into a darker film for an older audience but the book was written as a children's story.

Elf/Dwarf love story? Huh? They are two different species! What's next, a dog/whale/bird love triangle? And the albino orc? Did Dan Brown write this or something?

Dear Peter Jackson,

The Hobbit has been in print for decades. It has a huge following and brings joy to any who read it, young and old. Please stop treating this simple masterpiece of fantasy like toilet paper. You are making it impossible for anyone to get their children to read it because of the ham handed ""hollywood-ing"" you have infected the story with.

When translating a book to the screen, it is understandable that one might
use a little artistic license to keep the story under 10 hours. To take a book that your entire audience is completely familiar with and use it as a Cliff Note to your grand artistic vision is despicable! If you hate Tolkein that much, please stop making these movies and let someone else put these on the big screen!",1398124800,52,1242,4.560538116591928
4634780,4,B0059XTU3G,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, second part of Peter Jacksons new Tolkien trilogy, has so many characters and subplots that we almost forget how this epic story had started. I think it was about young Bilbo Baggins adventure and spiritual growth when the prequel trilogy started a few years ago. Now what we have is something different, though that does not really mean the film is totally disappointing.

In short, the second installment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is a little about Bilbo (Martin Freeman, brilliant as ever), a little bit about Gandalf (great Ian McKellen), as well as about a love triangle and other subplots plus impressive Smaug the Dragon. There are lots of action scenes involving the Dwarves and Orcs (and a few Elves), which are entertaining, to be sure, but there is little to none character development here.

To me, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug almost seems like filler than a story. This is not to say the film is boring, but I am not really sure if they needed three movies to cover the Hobbit story.",1398124800,3,1049,4.758241758241758

The idea of making this book into THREE movies is ridiculous and it's obvious that a great number of scenes were just inserted to ""run the clock.""

The visuals and special effects were on-par with the first Hobbit, although they're not the best. (The pieces of white plastic in the water that were supposed to be ice were pretty ridiculous). It's also pretty obvious when they switch between live-action and CG animations (which are only so-so compared to other movies).

This and the other movies are thoroughly enjoyable and well crafted.

The Desolation of Smaug is superior, in my opinion to the first of the 3 hobbit movies.
It is Fluid, serious well acted and flows nicely.  The movies length is not an issue, as has been sugested by some.

My only objection is one that many would NOT a agree with:

I would prefer to have ONE COMPLETE MOVIE that ran 6 or 7 hours, than having 3 over a 3 year period.

I can't say enough about the performances, including Ian McKellan and Richard Armitage - or more rightly, Gandalf and Thorin,  as you become totally immersed in their characterizations and don't think of them as actors.

I understand that there must be significant changes made to translate between media, but nearly a third of the episodes were not just from outside the Hobbit, but not nearly in keeping with the ethos of Middle Earth.

The orc hunting party, the Legolas-Kili-Whatshername love triangle, the inflation of Radagast from a single sentence in the whole original universe into the JarJar Binks of LOTR--The excessive commercially-crass tie-ins to LOTR. I could even enjoy the completely contrived love triangle if it had been modeled more along the conceits for love story in the Silmarillion rather than a superficial smear of teen drama romance.

I'm not one who looks for the movie version to exactly replicate the book, but this is the worst thing since the commercialization of the book of the Revelation of the Apocalypse in the Evangelical series Left Behind.

I do like the King of Mirkwood character. I think complexifying a view of the races of Middle Earth is a satisfying elaboration very much in keeping with Tolkien's universe. I could see the third movie coming out of this nosedive. There is always hope.",1398038400,6,1233,4.946859903381642

Though the film has its high points, the decision by Peter Jackson to expand a fantasy novel into a three-film epic has resulted in a top-heavy, padded slog that tests the viewers patience, particularly youngsters.

4634943,1,B0059XTU3G,"This has to be a phenomenon among movie goers that people are enjoying this film.  If you haven't read the book by Tolkien, it is far less violent, less involved, has way better dialogue, and has some real meaning. The thing is, I don't understand how anyone can sit through this much violence, poor dialogue, and constant video game type CGI.  It is exhausting and wearying on the eyes and brain to have a constant barrage of violence in between brief moments of plot.

So let me break down my issues with this film:
1. The dialogue.
Yet another LOTR movie with very poor dialogue.  Dialogue is not subtle in any way.  It is not meaningful.  It seems like every single line of dialogue Jackson writes is attempted to be super powerful, dark, and inspirational.  This is tiring and laughable dialogue especially when you have read the exquisite dialogue from the book.  Tolkien is a master of language.  The dialogue was already written for this movie.  Not much extra was needed.

2. Violence.
Is this what movie making has become in the past 10 years?  A little bit of plot followed by hundreds of acts of CGI video game violence?  How can any fan honestly write a review of this film and say if Tolkien saw it he would be proud?  You may be saying these are Jackson's films, but Jackson on multiple occasions has stated that ultimately these should be Tolkien's films.  I doubt that.  The violence is wearying and it is catering to our every increasing population of people who do not appreciate strong dialogue, plot, and would rather watch a video game.

3. Smaug and Bilbo.
This scene should warrant Jackson a permanent ban from touching any Tolkien book again.  This chapter in the book was so powerful with Bilbo and Smaug exchanging cunning with each other in the flicker of darkness.  The drama was caused by the sense of imminent danger or sudden movements.  The strength and power of the chapter was built on the base of words and imagery of emotion.  What did Jackson turn this scene into?  Yet another exhausting video game CGI fest of violence.  Shame, absolute shame.

4. Anything outside of Bilbo.
What makes movies work is a connection with the protagonist and I'm struggling to figure out who it is in the film.  Last I checked, the book was about Bilbo's journey from frightened sheltered hobbit to brave hero.  That is all lost in a convolution of connections to the LOTR movies, made up characters and plots, and intervals of elongated unnecessary violence.  Legolas, ditch it. The love between a dwarf and an elf, please. Bilbo is many times pushed to the back of the film.  I often times forget he is in the film.

I'm going to get many thumbs down for this review.  Not sure why.  This is the worst kind of populist film making.  There is nothing meaningful about it.  I suppose if you are one of the many who enjoy dizzying camera shots, constant video game, cartoon like violence that removes any sort of power that action scenes have, and dialogue that seems written by high school freshman comp students.......well enjoy away.",1397865600,247,3055,4.650467289719626

""Well, no.""

Is it true in spirit?

""Yes!""

What is awesome:

1.) Very artistic and convincing special effects.

2.)  Long, involved, well-plotted, exciting fight scenes that go on for twenty minutes at a time.

3.)  Rousing dialogue and thrilling moments of story.  (Lots of chances for the not-so-good guys to do the right thing, and they do.)

4.) Convincing moments of heroism.

5.)  Fantastic cast. Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman are all incredibly engaging and entertaining--and you forget that Benedict Cumberbatch is the person doing a fantastic Smaug voice. Lee Pace makes an imposing and believably aristocratic King of the Elves.

6.)  Fun cameos. Peter Jackson and Stephen Colbert appear, momentarily.

7.)  Amazing sets.  The scenery is Escheresque in the Dwarf Halls, and the Elven realm is like cathedrals set into airy caves.

8.)  Good costuming. The elves dress like Elves, and the small details are gorgeous, even down to the braids in the Dwarves' hair.

9.)  Political commentary.  (Americans are Orcs, I think.)

10.)  The story is true to the details of Tolkien's world--they mention things like the Dwarvish Wind Lance, and they have an appropriate visual to go with it.  Even the final closing song credit is so good, you'll want to look it up. (Ed Sheeran)

Hell, even the dragon Smaug was awesome because it was voiced by Sherlock Holmes actor but what's even better is that the dragon loves to toy around to the point where you just laugh.

Don't worry you will enjoy this movie since it's much better than the 1st movie cause the 1st movie I was falling asleep in and out several times if you know what I mean.

4634983,5,B0059XTU3G,"It's been many years since I've read the works of Tolkien, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading as a teenager.  I'm quite sure Jackson has probably thoroughly trod on the toes of Tolkien in this latest chapter of the Hobbit's adventures and has probably made quite a mess of things.  Quite frankly, I don't care.  When I go to a movie, I try to judge the movie as a movie rather than trying to compare it to the book from which it is derived.  I'm not always successful with that formula but I try to stick with that idea as best as I can.  So, with that bit of tripe out the way, all I can say is that I really enjoyed ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"".

I learned after watching the movie that it was 3 hours long and that a number of whiners complained (as usual) about it's length.  I didn't even notice the time go by, which is very unusual for me.  Usually, if a movie fails to grab me and keep me totally focused and interested, I might, if I manage to finish the movie at all, simply parcel out the movie in stages until I finally get through the entire thing and that's only if I feel the movie is ""worthy"" of that effort.  In the case of .....Smaug, I was completely engaged throughout.

No, there is little heavy plot line to figure out here.  It's all pretty straightforward and simple.  And that's the way I remember Tolkien's works as well, except they often dragged on with so much extraneous detail that I would lose interest during long stretches of marching from here to there, etc.  While there was a fair share of that same marching in the movie as well, it didn't seem to get nearly as bogged down in it as Tolkien's books did.  For that, I was grateful.  Actually, there was a lot more running than marching anyway.

Martin Freeman was, as always, his usual wonderful Bilbo self; perfectly cast; perfectly acted.  Likewise, Ian McKellen as Gandalf is great.  And then there is the perfectly cast voice talents of Benedict Cumberbatch as the the great Smaug hisself.

The CG work on this film was again wonderfully done.  No, it is not on the same level as Avatar or The Life of Pi, but it is outstanding work nonetheless.  What more can I say?  Lots, but I'll just say I highly recommend ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" and I can't wait to see the final film of this trilogy.",1397779200,3,2305,4.3489461358313815

I'm so thankful that I waited to rent it instead of buying the digital copy when it was first released because I seriously doubt I will ever watch this film again.

As a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings films I wanted The Hobbit to live up to Peter Jackson's earlier works but two films in and I'm struggling to find a reason (other than money of course) for why such a thin book was stretched to fill three movies. The vast majority of Smaug seemed like filler to me with big huge action scenes and lots of CGI tossed in to make me stare in wonder while ignoring the lukewarm story. Unfortunately after the umpteenth great escape by our heroes, dumb moves by a supposedly smart character (Bilbo just keep the darn ring on, please) and a running time that had me reaching for the pause button over and over again; even the unrelenting action couldn't keep me interested in this dreck.

If Jackson had cut out most of the town scenes, most of the Elven nonsense (I'm speaking primarily of the romance bits with the new character) and do away with the vast majority of the all powerful father - son orc duo this movie could have come in under 2 hours and been a fun (though still shallow) ride. As it is the Desolation of Smaug is just an overly long and dull mess which leaves me feeling completely burned out on this franchise. I reserved tickets to see An Unexpected Journey at its midnight premiere but skipped the theater for this one to wait on a rental and for the third entry (There and Back Again) I think I'll just wait until I can see it free on cable.

Two stars for the fine performances by the actors.",1397779200,16,1749,4.293939393939394

4635012,3,B0059XTU3G,"There is no question that Peter Jackson once again hit a home run in recreating Tolkien's fantasy realms.  The settings and scenes were better than my own imagination from reading the book. The one trouble with the movie is the time he spent telling things that were simply not part of the original book. Yes, I know he is trying to tell the entire rise of the Dark Lord and derivedit from Tolkien's notes. Unfortunately, for me, that marred what the original tale was - a fun adventure.  Jackson is making the Hobbit into a far darker tale than I think Tolkien intended.  That said, the parts that were in the book were wonderful.  The Mirkwood scenes through the barrel ride down the river were a definite home run. The town on the lake and the meeting of Smaug was really some fun stuff.
It is a good movie to sit down and watch (especially if you read the book along with the LoTR), but I do wish he stayed along the original Hobbit story than trying to darken it up with the portrayal of the rise of the devil.",1397779200,3,1015,4.326315789473684

It seems to diminish the central message of the book and takes it too far into the theme park.  Thank goodness for the fast forward button.",1397779200,32,465,4.395348837209302
4635017,3,B0059XTU3G,"The movie was entertaining, however I don't think the additions to the original story add anything, and in truth I feel take away from the story.  It is obvious that Peter Jackson wants to make the Hobbit and epic prequel to the Lord of the Rings, but this takes away from the story of a quest to face a dragon and reclaim the lonely mountain.  It also looks as if they are focusing more on great visuals and less on story and characters.
 There is also a problem with chronology, Gandalf's fight with Sauron, doesn't make any sense, in the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring, Sauron return is in whispers and suspicions, the 9 riders appearance brings confirmation, but there are many who are in doubt and unaware.  The Hobbit takes place decades before the fellowship begins, Bilbo is celebrating his 111 birthday.  It is a little bit hard to understand Gandalf waiting all that time if he seen Sauron with his own eyes.  Likewise, if the 9 riders are out and about, how crazy is it to leave the ring in Bilbo's possession for all that time unprotected?  And why wait to destroy the ring? it would have been a lot easier to do before Sauron raise a million orc army to surround mount doom.  Visually, I liked the scenes with Gandalf fighting the darkness, but story wise it doesn't match up with the Lord of the Rings.
I could go on about a number of other additions, and how they distract from the original story, but suffice it to say, I don't think they are necessary.  I think Peter Jackson would have been better off, to do the Hobbit as a single story, and then if he wanted to write a tale of what happen in the in between time before the Lord of the rings, it would be better.  He could give us tales of Legolas, Journeys of Gandalf investigating Sauron, and even the dwarves opening the mines of Moria, along with any other additional stuff and characters and none of it taking away from original source work of the Hobbit or Lord of the rings.",1397779200,7,1960,4.404432132963989

4635019,5,B0059XTU3G,"PETER JACKSON does it like no other filmmaker today  setting standards of excellence in picture and sound that put the audience smack in the middle of the movie whether at the theater or at home.

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug continues the mission to the Lonely Mountain, where Thorin Oakinshield (Richard Armitage), his band of stalwart dwarfs and their Hobbit burglar, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), plan to regain their homeland. As we learned in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the dwarfs kingdom, along with the human-populated city of Dale, has been destroyed by the dragon, Smaug. Gold is good dragon bait and the dwarfs, ruled by Thorins father, had a LOT of it. Now we see the ruin  the desolation  of Smaugs fury, fueled by dragon greed. By the end of the film, we get to see that big red baddie at his mean-tempered worst.

But before we get to that  and a terrific cliffhanger finale  we have over two hours of action, where Oakinshields little army take on Orcs and Sylvan elves. (We are reminded in the extras that Tolkien said the Sylvan elves were not as wise as their high kinfolk [Elrond, Galadriel], but mighty fierce. Smaug bears that out, especially when we see Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lily) wielding bow and blade in battle.) Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) is here, too, learning things that will lead to the events in Jacksons first trilogy, The Lord of the Rings.

Count on the Grey Wizard to be right in the heart of it.

The high-def picture and surround soundtrack are brilliant on Blu-ray; Jackson sets his own standard, and then tops it with every new film. This second installment of J.R.R. Tolkiens The Hobbit is clearly one of the top five live-action 3-D Blu-rays available, joining Gravity, Life of Pi, and Star Trek: Into Darkness. In the extras, we even see him wearing 3-D glasses during filming to make sure he captures the full experience, viewing scenes on a 3-D monitor on set as they're shot.

The picture-window effect  with objects darting out of the screen towards you  is extremely active, from Smaugs fiery breath and zinging arrows, to the bees buzzing around your head and gentle snowflakes falling onto your lap. The visual depth is like looking through a picture window at panoramic views. Again, we see New Zealand in all its beauty, but we also plunge the depths of Mirkwood, lair of nasty giant spiders, the snowcapped peaks of the Misty Mountains, and the gloomy maze of Lake-town. Still, the action scenes create Smaugs benchmark, especially the white water chase where the dwarfs ride the rapids in barrels while battling Orcs  with the help of Legolas and Tauriel  on either side and above.

The effect is dizzying on high-def, widescreen Blu-ray and DVD. On 3-D it is AMAZING  and so is the confrontation between dwarfs, hobbit and dragon near the end of film. What youll notice most, however, is how well the 3-D experience flows throughout as subtle effects  bees, rain, birds, snow  blend with more traditional action sequences.

The only hiccup is having to change discs midstream when viewing the 3-D. Its impossible to put a nearly three-hour movie onto one Blu-ray, especially when including uncompressed soundtracks. Disc one ends in Bards (Luke Evans) Lake-town home  where the dwarfs enter via toilet. But this is a minor grumble in an otherwise faultless presentation.

The final test of popping the 3-D glasses above your eyes to see how blurry the scenes are  the more blurry, the more 3-D active  passes with gold stars. Every spot we tested, especially the wide scenes, were obviously blurry; close-ups were less. Some of the action sequences and the long running time could cause dizziness, possibly headaches, in those who are 3-D motion sensitive. However, we rate The Desolation of Smaug among the top five 3-D action adventures.

All three versions  DVD, Blu-ray and 3-D  have the same color tones and levels. Do we even have to say it? The soundtrack is sensational, creating a totally balanced surround experience from the chirp of birds to Howard Shores score. Dialogue, effects and ambient sound put viewers center-scene throughout.

Extreme Tolkien purists will find room to complain. Woman warrior elf Tauriel is a new creation, as is her romance with fan favorite, Legolas, not to mention the chemistry between her and dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner). We also follow Gandalf as he leaves Bilbo and the dwarfs to chase down other problems. Thats right; we didn't go there in the book. Do these moments diminish the movie? No. Ill also add that the humor in Smaug was smart and fun, more what I expected in a book-to-screen adaptation of Tolkiens work, unlike the more rowdy bits in An Unexpected Journey. Thanks for listening, P.J.

We can expect an extended cut of Smaug sometime later this year  and even more extras along with a commentary. Still, the theatrical release offers plenty of bonus features and all worth your time. All three versions get New Zealand: Home of Middle-earth, Part 2, returning us to the locations where the film was shot.

A second disc available in the Blu-ray and 3-D package has Peter Jackson Invites You to the Set, a four-part video blog, where, among other things, we see a dwarf workout sequence in which the actors in partial costume show how they get in shape for the action scenes. (Definitely filmed exclusively for fans.)

The four-part Production Videos show pick-up shots and other post-production work, and has a segment with Howard Shore  and the orchestra  working on the score. If you've ever watched a P.J. extra on any of his presentations, you know how entertaining and informative they can be. These are no exception. Who knew flute players were the prima donnas of the orchestra? I mean, really!

4635071,5,B0059XTU3G,"The Desolation of Smaug lacks the pacing of its predecessor. It is, basically, one action scene after another with just a brief respite for breakfast at Beorn's place. I know, I know, there are conversation scenes in the Elvin kingdom and Lake Town, but somehow they don't slow the pace enough for me to catch my breath. My one other disappointment is with the water effects during the barrel journey. I hear that in HFR the water looks fine, but I didn't have an opportunity to see this film in HFR. In both 3D and flat, there are moments that look like they were filmed with a GoPro. They're really surprising smack dab in the middle of a Jackson special effects tour de force.

Having said all that, I gave this film five stars. Because I've loved the material since I was a kid, and the fact that Peter Jackson and his team love it too shows in every frame (except the aforementioned water scenes). Yes, they've fussed with the plot and introduced Legolas and Tauriel. I'm okay with that. Tolkien's book is sadly lacking in female characters and after all, Legolas would have been in Mirkwood at that time. At least they didn't have twenty-something Aragorn moping around Rivendell in the first movie! (Actually, I would have loved that) But this insertion allowed for Legolas's contemptuous sneer when looking at a drawing of Gloin's wee bairn Gimli.

Bilbo's growth and his realization that the trinket he picked up is something more is beautifully done. Thorin's growing enthrallment by his ancestral riches is too.

I'm looking forward tp the extended edition of this film, and in another year or so, the weekend when I can do a six movie extended edition Tolkien marathon.",1397692800,3,1681,4.73037542662116

I should have waited to see if the extended one will have a collector's/limited edition version, but do I take that chance? It really frustrates me, when companies do something like this. If the extended version will have a collector's/limited edition, will it come with the same book ends? It shouldn't because this one did, and they were LIMITED! So, if it does come out with a Collector's Edition, I guess I'm dropping more money. Yay capitalism, and thanks for changing things up, Jerks!",1397692800,,712,4.991596638655462

The special effects (especially Smaug), scenery and costumes are excellent-but don't expect to get caught up in the story.  I think there is just a lot of story to cover and this is the nuts-n-bolts aspect of story. You're setting up the everything that happened with Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring. It didn't get exciting until the last 30 minutes. I also had trouble with all the stories that accompanied the production of this film...those images ruined my enjoyment of any animals I saw used in the film.

Sorry, it's not that great a film for the casual Hobbit reader/watcher. If you love the Hobbit series I'm sure you'll love it.",1397692800,2,739,4.676923076923077
4635104,1,B0059XTU3G,"This installment proves that Jackson was simply after more money when he split this story into three parts...This chapter was far too drawn out, way too CGI heavy, and (imho) made a mockery of the book it is allegedly based on. Yes I understand that Jackson has taken a great deal of license with Tolkien's work before, but some of that was due to time constraints in developing the characters. But here Jackson simply invents things out of whole cloth, and in other areas so bastardizes the story as to make it almost unwatchable.

I saw the first one multiple times, bought the DVD, and the extended version. This second one I barely made it through in the cinema, I will not be buying the DVD, extended or not, and at this point it is highly doubtful I will bother with the third installment at all.

Peter Jackson should be ashamed of himself and what he has done to a much beloved children's tale but I doubt he, or the movie studio will care as they will be too busy suing each other for more of the profits from these dreadful adaptations of Tolkien's work.",1397692800,7,1064,4.4512820512820515

4635149,4,B0059XTU3G,"I had per-ordered this but thanks to an Amazon screw-up ended up buying it a week later from a local store.  I had read a lot of negative reviews about how it was more like a video game and not a movie, just action and no story or character development, etc, etc ,etc...  So I had somewhat lower expectation when I purchased this movie to add to my LOTR & Hobbit collection - yes I'm stuck buying the lot even if there's a few bad apples!

I have to say though that I didn't find this one that bad, perhaps because I had been expecting worse?  I have only watched the UV HD version on my 7"" Nexus so far, but was entertained through most of the movie.  Towards the end they excitement builds and of course you are left with a ""cliff-hanger"" but you know this going in as it's already been announced there will be three movies.

I had intended just to watch half of the movie initially since it was late, but I couldn't turn it off and had to see what was going to happen next.  This movie has a bit more action and quicker pace to it that the first Hobbit movie.  At times it seems ""rushed"" as they move from one section to the next to the next; always being chased by someone or something it seemed.

The movie also has some good subtle parts I think - like Bilbo perhaps starting to realize the ""magic ring"" has a bit more power than just making him invisible as he seems to be coming more attached to it, Smaug using the phrase ""my precious"" and I think at one point Bilbo mentions ""Underhill"" which I believe is the name Frodo used at the prancing pony.

I don't mind so much more being added to the story, but I do wonder how it will ""play out"" in the end.  I mean we've already seen the LOTR and this is the prequel, so what happens to these ""extra"" characters between - perhaps we'll find out in the next Hobbit movie?  Speaking of the next movie, I am curious as to how they'll approach it - seems like it's mainly going to be battles with perhaps a little story line/plot thrown in.

If you are a JRR Tolkien fanatic, then think of this as a movie ""loosely"" based on the Hobbit and JRR Tolkien works.  Kind of like movies ""based"" on real events - little reality and a lot of Hollywood.  Then you might actually enjoy it.

4635152,3,B0059XTU3G,"It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't as good as the first one. I think, like many others have said, that it missed the mark because it is the middle section of the trilogy; there was no sense of beginning, middle, end for this film. Unlike the Lord of the Ring trilogy, where each movie could have stood on it's own without any previous knowledge of the story or the film before.

Anyone who has not read this book or seen the first movie recently, will probably find themselves utterly lost and confused with the goings on in Smaug.

The film is a rolicking good adventure, and the script writers have undoubtedly done their homework into the vast history of Middle Earth (to pad the book out to three films). But the end result is a fast-paced action film in a very modern mould with none (or at least very, very little) of the atmosphere, charm or gentleness that Tolkien absolutely filled the novel with.

As an adaptation, therefore, this film is a failure. As a film, though, it's quite good. Just pretend The Hobbit was never a book and you might enjoy it.",1397606400,5,660,4.401639344262295

4635220,4,B0059XTU3G,"The second installment of Peter Jackson's 'Hobbit' trilogy improves upon the first lovely film in the sense that the action flows more convincingly and fans are treated to new vistas and never-before-visited destinations, all of which amount to a feast for the eyes and senses. I'll list the five best things about TDOS and then the two worst, in my opinion:

1. Martin Freeman's essay of the Bilbo character, full of superb idiosyncrasies and deft little comic flourishes, remains the rich, rewarding center of this epic treatment and keeps a lot of aspects of the film from possibly spinning off into superfluousness.

2. Benedict Cumberbatch's motion-capture interpretation of Smaug is nothing short of awe-inspiring. You believe this massive CGI dragon is REALLY that vain and REALLY living under that Lonely Mountain. Kudos to Cumberbatch and the effects team.

3. The action sequences featuring Legolas (a bit paunchier, but, hey), Tauriel, the barrel-run and the battles in LakeTown make for riveting cinema and are superbly paced. Speaking of pace ...

4. Lee Pace offers us a mesmerizing Thranduil, King of the Woodland Elves -- a haughty and ominous portrayal that makes me eager to see what he does with the character in the 3rd film.

5. Finally we get to imagine what it might be like for Gandalf to meet the resurgent Sauron head-on and their Light vs. Shadow duel (as well as the whole journey into Dol Goldur) was a very compelling use on the writers' parts of various non-Hobbit Tolkien canonical material to flesh this film out. Sweet. I look forward to seeing Galadriel coming to Gandalf's rescue ... which was foreshadowed in the first film. How will she (backed by the White Council) measure-up against the Necromancer? Hmmm...

The Two Most Unconvincing Things About TDOS:

1. What the first film lacked (at times) in forward momentum, it made up for with fabulously bucolic emotion. This film has little of that and, as a result, it lacks the trademark ""heart"" I've come to expect from Jackson, who has always been able to deftly blend his swashbuckling action with pathos.

2. I thought the whole LakeTown sequence and introduction of characters was tedious to the point of me getting up to fix myself a sandwich and not bothering to pause the Blu-Ray disc. Bard's family-life and the plot-point with Tauriel saving Kili with Athelas and the rest of the town, frankly, did not have a lot of spark (save for Legolas's action sequence). But I guess this was a necessary evil, the introduction of so MUCH LakeTown.

Anyhow, my quibbles are minor indeed. This is a worthy and resplendent epic by Peter Jackson and friends. It is not as ""classic"" as the LOTR films, in my opinion, then again it is difficult to compare them, given the differing demands of the source material. This is a must-own for filmgoers. You and your kids and your kids' kids will treasure it always.",1397520000,2,2892,4.873727087576375

You have seen ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.""This is for you who have not read the book.
When we last left the company after being dropped off by the Eagles, Gandalf tells them they will try to get aid from Beorn, a large and moody man who can change into a giant bear. Gandalf will go first; and start a tale-and every five minutes a Dwarve should run to join them. Gandalf keeps talking, and Beorn soon says a friend of his now nine. It goes on when then the remaining five Dwarves rush out and flop down together. But Beorn is not in a angry mood and puts them up and feeds them-but wariness and suspicion remain and he is greatly troubled about the excursions of the Orcs so far West. At night when all are going to sleep Gandalf has his pipe out, and notices Bilbo watching,""he goes hunting,"" and Bilbo falls asleep. In the morning Beorn is friendly and laughing [Gandalf's story of of Orcs was true] Thorin is anxious to continue west. Beorn loans them some of his horses packed with food-but they must send the horse back at a certain point. They want to keep them when they reach it but Gandalf says he holds his horses dearly and points out that a great bear has kept them under watch and Bilbo's sharp eyes had seen what they missed. But Gandalf does not get down, he's returning his horse by riding it back-now they do feel bad, and his parting words are, ""stay on the trail in Mirkwood."" After countless days of dark dreary travel, and running out of food, they come to a dark river and find a boat, but the boat is on the other side-they snare it with a rope and the crossing goes well until Bombur (the fattest) falls in the water and can't be revived so they take turns carrying him. The rest of the Dwarves (and Bilbo) get attacked by giant spiders. With his ring of invisibility and Sting, Bilbo manages to kill many spiders and rescue the Dwarves. Once freed, and at night they notice circles of light burning and much singing and run toward them-but once a foot touches a circle-poof! complete blackness and silence; it repeats more lights then blackness. They finally manage to find each other after a lot of trouble. This happens again and they are captured. The Dwarves are then taken prisoner by the Wood-elves (Silvan Elves). Bilbo quickly accompanies them to the Elven king's dungeon, again while wearing his ring. As the Dwarves sit in their thirteen separate cells,(Thorin won't talk) Bilbo manages to figure a way to escape. One night when all the elves are busy with a large feast, he frees the Dwarves and packs them into barrels with straw. Two Elves have the job of dumping them in the river-one says they feel full, the other says I don't care how they feel, the King said in the river. After a long bumpy ride leaving them sea sick[Bilbo hangs on and catches a cold] they arrive in in Lake-town, closest to the Lonely Mountain, Dwarven Kingdom Erebor. Bilbo and the Dwarves get assistance from the Master of Lake-town to travel to the Lonely Mountain. They settle down in front of the side door marked on Thorin's map. At last, Durin's Day comes and the door suddenly reveals a keyhole. Thorin uses his key to unlock the side door and open a tunnel into the heart of the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo uses this passage to creep down and steal a golden cup from Smaug the dragon. Bilbo also has a bit of a chat with the dragon (who can't see him, thanks to the handy ring.) Bilbo catches a glimpse of a bare patch of scales in Smaug's chest, which he realizes is the dragon's weak point. Bilbo tells the Dwarves about this bare patch of scales, which is Smaug's weak point.
Smaug, misses this one golden cup from his entire hoard of treasure, and remembering the term ""barrel rider."" Enraged, he decides to fly to Lake-town to remind them he's the real ""King under the Mountain.""
As you can see there is a wide cast of characters and events in Jackson's movie that simply did not exist in the original.
There are two different names that are mixed up in the movie: Sorcerer of Dolguldur, and the Necromancer, both are incarnations of Sauron. Gandalf got the map for Thorin from a dungeon of the Necromancer Azog and his group of Orcs and Radaghast the Brown are never mentioned in ""The Hobbit."" Sauron in no form was not mentioned-as strongly as he could have sensed the One Ring, strongest if it was being used, he would have taken it. And so forth with many more examples.

I pre-ordered the movie weeks ago and was told that it would arrive the day that the movie would be released. It came a day early! I was surprised and very impressed. The quality of the case and DVD's were absolutely perfect, there was even an extra DVD with just special features on it. That was another unexpected surprise not mentioned in the description.

The only negative thing about this purchase was the digital copy. I was unhappy with the fact that when I opened the DVD to load the digital copy it wasn't going to go through iTunes. It was going to go through a Flixster account. That is the reason why i buy digital copies. I wish that it was stated somehow on the description when buying the DVD which type of digital copy that it is going to be. When playing my DVD's on Flixster vs. iTunes the screen is smaller and blurry where on iTunes the screen is as big as my computer and has a clear and crisp picture.

4635306,3,B0059XTU3G,"I am not a stickler for the book.  I don't mind changes from the source material; a movie and a book are two different things.

I was disappointed in this movie because it was too fast. The first movie was nice and slow.  A fair amount of people complained about that but I didn't mind it at all.  We had time to enjoy Bag End, to have some fun with the trolls, and drink some of the elves fine wine.  In this movie, all of a sudden Thorin turns into a whiny teenager, they spend one night with the elves, and Beorn just sends them on there way just like that (and don't get me started on him being ok with them just running into his house unannounced).
And the elf dwarf romance thing, not good,

Now Smaug was awesome, and Lake Town was alright, but overall I was left feeling empty and underwhelmed. Perhaps I loved the first movie so much my hopes were too high going in.

However the mediocreness of  this movie gives me hope for the next one because of the Trilogy Rule.

The Trilogy Rule states that only two movies in a trilogy can be really good.  The first one has to be good, if the second one is just as good or better than the first, then the third will undoubtedly be bad (Return of the Jedi).  If the second one is bad (Temple of Doom) then the third is going to be really good, as good or better than the first.

Keeping the Trilogy Rule in mind, and the source material that will be covered (Burning of Laketown, Battle of the five armies), I have high hopes for the Third movie.  Especially because epic battles are Peter Jackson's specialty.

Details like the maps and the ponies and other misc. things they probably ran out of time doing..  This film feels more like a separate adventure than the first movie despite the continuity.  Still, well done! Good acting, new things to see, nice special effects.

However, none of the characters are as engaging, charismatic or hot like the previous trilogy-so not really caring if an Orc eats them. I kept looking at the time-not reason for it to be as Long. I also felt dj vu a lot! Felt like I have seen them going over a bunch of mountains and battle the same creatures already. The only other interesting thing was seeing bilbo become taken over by the ring. This movie was a step up from the first which was atrociously boring.",1397433600,,537,4.2745098039215685

If a movie based on my favorite book is watchable I am pretty happy.  This is nearly unwatchable.  I almost turned it off twice: the first time during the barrel scene which was silly and the second time during the Smaug scene which was just W. T. F. stupid.  Floating on a boat in a river of molten gold?  Really?  Are they trying to make a Hobbit amusement park ride?  Minor gripes - the love triangle was silly but the new elf was pretty awesome looking so it was tolerable to watch.  The movie felt contrived.  Some people are calling Peter Jackson the new George Lucas - I don't know if I would go that far but maybe i would.  There's just too much pointless fluff and stupid action and I am normally a fan of stupid action.  PJ should have only made 2 movies.",1397433600,3,878,4.1

4635348,1,B0059XTU3G,"This movie was not tolkiens hobbit, it was peter jacksons the adventures of dwarves and hobbits in disney land. The movie butchered everything about the book to create some weird hybrid fantasy comedy that just didn't work. I understand that movies aren't the same as the books and that books have more detail but to completely hack apart the story and create a new story is just wrong. Jackson decided that he was going to make 3 movies out of a 300 page book. This would be impossible if he wanted to only use material from the book, so to bridge the gap jackson adds stuff like necromancers and a white goblin. These additions just takes the movie in a bad direction making me wonder when will it end and how badly will they butcher it in the third movie.

Im not going to go into a tirade on how Jackson changed the characters or added characters like legolas and a love story just because he wanted to.

BIGGEST problem of the movie-(spoiler)- it ends like a t.v show, meaning that it just cuts away leaving me with the feeling of why did I just waste 3 hours of my life to watch it end like that. It didn't end like a movie leaving me wondering what will happen in the next movie. It left me with the 'come back next week to see__ happen'.

All this extra Hollywood action only distracts as we yawn through one camera trick after another.
Jackson should have learned from his disappointing and ponderous King Kong which was still far inferior to the original of 80 years ago.
Perhaps Jackson will treat us to an author's cut of the film, editing out all his additions and making it a Tolkien film.
He did so well with Lord of the Rings.
If only he respected the Hobbit in filming it perhaps he would have made a good movie.
This is but a watered down, Tolkien-Lite attempt. As was part 1, and likely part 3.",1397433600,,698,4.5476190476190474

4635362,3,B0059XTU3G,"This film is cinematically stunning. It depicts Middle Earth at its height (as it should). However, I found that the length of the movie is its biggest shortcoming. The plot brings in a lot of unnecessary subplots (i.e. a potential thwarted romance between a dwarf and elf) that takes away from the main thrust of the story (The dwarves and hobbit's journey to confront Smaug).

Too much effort is taken to give all the dwarves their face time on the film and the attempt to make Thorin an action hero is overdone. There are a a few excellent scenes with Martin Freeman depicting Bilbo Baggins' realization the effect the one ring is beginning to have on him - and I would have preferred to see more of that dynamic than the constant action scenes (dwarves vs. spiders, dwarves vs. elves, dwarves vs. orcs... you get the idea).

I think the title is misleading too, as Smaug doesn't appear until the last 50-40 minutes of the film. So, I got my money's worth waiting for the release on Amazon.com streaming service as I would have been disappointed had I gone to the cinema to pay money to view this movie.",1397433600,,1106,4.552763819095477

4635384,2,B0059XTU3G,"The Peter Jackson' Tolkien series ""jumps the shark"" (or dragon) in this second installment of the Hobbit.  The movie shambles along until the escape from the elf king's realm in barrels.  The action sequence looks more like a preview for a theme park ride than cinematography.  It's also ""Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon"" without the slow motion cuts or the incredible beauty.  It' when movie making become pedestrian that you notice that Orlando Bloom looks far older (and more tired) in the Hobbit than he did in LOTR.

The movie itself groans under the weight of the number of dwarves.  Two movies (and what seemed like eight hours) in, I still don't know who's who... except for Thorin Oakenshield.  What's worse.  I don't really care.  Put the excess dwarves in red tunics and allow the orcs, worgs, or whoever to thin the herd a la Star Trek.  What should be a compelling story about recovering a lost home becomes lost in the script.

Even Smaug, the villain we're supposed to love to hate, sounds too much like the demon in the Tom Cruise/Mia Sara movie ""Legend.""  At least Smaug is well done in CGI (no bouncing horns).  The Master of Laketown, the normally capable Stephen Fry, is relegated to a cartoon character.  At the end, the Desolation of Smaug wanders towards the '77 Rankin-Bass, ""Hobbit"" though stops well short of that abysmal low point.

The movie suffers from the high bar set by the LOTR series.  Fans enter expecting Jackson to catch lightning in a bottle again, and it simply does not happen.",1397433600,4,1516,4.75095785440613

I was so disappointed in the first movie.  It was just phoned in, in my opinion and I'm all for recycling but I swore they used scenes from the LOTR movies and just stuck some new actors in.  So for this reason, I wasn't about to spend $20 to see the second one.  I decided to rent this film on Friday night and I'm glad I did.  It's way too long which is utterly bizzare because the book isn't that long.  I couldn't imagine how they were going to get three movies out of it.  But I guess you could stretch anything for money.  The movie was quite good.  I have a penchant for female superheroes kicking butt so Turiel was my favorite bit of the movie.  Another is the dragon.  Way too many lines for the dragon.  I thought, wow, you really get an impression of how magnificent the dragon is, I just wish he'd stop talking.  I would have loved to meet him but I would have had to kill him to get him to shut up.

I had to watch it several times because I couldn't sit through the whole thing in one shot; another good reason for watching it on video. Overall it's a good movie, a bit of a hot mess in places, but definitely worth the $3.99 rental.",1397433600,,1288,4.137096774193548

HOWEVER... Jackson's apparent need to spice up the story got more than a little out of hand as Bilbo and company launch into the barrel-rider sequence. The battle that takes place therein was clumsily cartoonish, which only tends to exacerbate the fact that the book describes no battle at all. The troop was sealed in apple barrels and pushed into the drink - too boring I suppose. Jackson's departures from the story, tend to ruin the movie for readers of the Hobbit.

4635445,4,B0059XTU3G,"This segment of ""The Hobbit"" was far different than the original book.  The book was for children.  This movie was far far darker, and more violent than the book and definitely NOT for children.

Even including the extra violence, the story line was different than the book.  Besides the addition of Tauriel, the inclusion of Legolas was different although implied by ""The Lord of the Rings"" later story.  The escape from the Elven King and the later entrance into Lake Town was far different but fun.  The battle with the Orcs on the river with Legolas jumping from dwarf to dwarf (on their heads) was fun.

The fight with Smaug within the castle was never in the book.  Smaug never saw the dwarves, he only smelled Bilbo and Thorin never mentioned the Arkenstone that early in the story.

I do think the best part of the movie was the look of surprise on both Smaug's and Thorin's faces when Thorin is standing on Smaug's nose!  It may not have been in the book, but it was fun!

There are many other changes from the book.  This movie doesn't ruin the story in the book but it definitely changes it quite a bit.

4635447,2,B0059XTU3G,"I read the book and as a long term fan of this I can say that they butchered the movie. With adding charecters that don't exist, to totaly changing things. The Merkwod went so fast, considering that was a huge part of the book I felt that could have been done much better. They could have done the part where they meet the elves right. Adding Leggless to the moves was just stupid, that charecter didn't show up until Fellowship. Even thou the first three movies had it's fualts and Two Towers could have been better they at least did one thing right by giving the movie a feeling that it was a long Journay, in the book they were on the road for a long time and it felt that they just rushed throught the first half of the moving, with wierd action parts that not only made no since but made me felt like I was watching a low budget action movie.

I felt thou the first movie wasn't perfect it had a much better feel to it then this one did. It felt more like the first three. For the most part the Goluma sence was pretty well done, thou a little rushed. They should have taken lessons because they runined the smog sence. It was horribe. The book is a time honored story, They had a moment to impress me their. When the ring came off a Bilbo I just rolled my eye's I knew they killed it. Of all the mistakes they made that was the worst, if all the sences that they could have played with, this was not one of them. To have the drawves fight with smog just prooved that the makers of this movie cared only about selling a action movie and cared nothing about pleasing the fans of the book.

All my complaints can be sumed up into saying that their was no since of drama, or the feeling that the first trilogy gave. They cared nothing for pleasing the fans of the book, they didn't even care to right a good story. I have seen better stories that made more since from low budget action movies or old B rated movies. They took a amazing book that I couldn't put down and loved and just destroyed it. Even more so I can tell you now the third movie will be even more of a joke because at the point they left off the book had only a few chapters left.

But he just can't seem to leave a good story alone.  I'm a Tolkien fan from my youth - which is saying something - and I love the Middle Earth stories from the Hobbit to the Silmarillion.  Peter Jackson does too, i'll wager, but he seems to feel like his adaptations are as beloved as the original stories -  he has become more and more bold about changing them.  Nearly all of the adaptations in the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and this installment, Desolation of Smaug, are gratuitous and overbearing.  I really tired of the constant Orc scenes in Desolation.  It really kind of wrecked the movie for me.  I can appreciate the growing presence of Sauron and his armies of darkness in the background, and as subtle bylines in the movies, but I just really got upset that we couldn't have the story without so many Orcs!  Azog, Bolg, and Tauriel were just too much.  Smaug was magnificent, but the dwarves never battled him as was depicted in the movie, so that set up was more bothersome to me than entertaining.  Admittedly I'm a Tolkien purist.  5 stars plus for costumes, character profiles, cinematography, special effects, and settings.  1 star or less for the massive adaptations.",1397347200,,1364,4.656903765690377

Please remember this is not just the Hobbit novel, but includes loads of research from the Tolkien archives of all of the surrounding writings about this basic time and Tolkien back stories along with the maps, etc. In my opinion, it's well researched and brings family entertainment to a brilliant level.

4635472,4,B0059XTU3G,"I am a huge fan of Tolkien, and I think I cried every time the latest installment of the trilogy was released. As we all know, the Hobbit trilogy has been rather a letdown from that level of technical (the props! The sets! The drool!) and plot expertise, but I guess it can't be helped considering the first series took ten years, and this one took one or two years of pre planning. Onto the movie itself.

I really enjoyed the beginning, no complaints there. The graphics and effects and 'background stuff' moved a lot closer to the level of quality I expected this time around. Then we get into messy territory. For one, there is a character that is played completely through CG. And you can tell. Maybe it's because I'm used to 'realistic effects' that are clearly CG, but it was just kind of obvious to me this was a fake creature. I wish they had spliced a dressed up character and a CG version together so it would be more relatably realistic. Might just be a generational problem, though, as I really am kind of dulled to 'amazingly realistic graphics' that look really fake. Sort of like botox making a person look older because you assume a person bothering with botox must be ancient.

Next, Beorn. The scene with Beorn in the book took up several chapters, in the movie it took a minute or two. It's kind of a big scene in the book, so if there are three movies to portray one book, you'd think they'd have time to do the scene properly. Characterization in the book and in the movie as well as sequence of events is completely different, so that will bother you if you liked the book a lot. But, let's face it, what isn't bothersome about this 'adaption'? Let's try to suspend anger at the differences and focus on the movie as it is.

I like the addition of a girl in the movie, we were rather lacking a female character in the plot. And who doesn't like a little romance? She's not completely out of thin air, she existed in the appendices or the Silmarilion, forget which. Anyways, though it got me a little grumpy to see her here, I decided I quite liked the character. She was kick ass, especially for an elf, and there was some bittersweet- she's kind of an outcast half elf- and sweet- falling in love with a dwarf- so she's a good character in the end.

The action scenes were awesome. Swords and speed and chase scenes galore. No complaints there. There are three different bad guys in the movie, so that really amps up the danger and suspense, which I quite enjoyed.

The dragon, though also CG, was much better. It looked alive ish. And of course the voice over was great, no complaints.

The title ""Desolation of Smaug"" is referring to the fact that the mountain kingdom is empty, and the land has a lot of burnt patches, and the city of Dale is poor. This is all the 'desolution' the dragon left when first moving in, long ago. The dragon doesn't attack in this movie, basically. Much.

Anyways, it wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was still a good movie in its own right. Equal to some of the best blockbusters, not better. Decent. I would just wait until it goes on sale. Actually, I already did, and now proudly own it. It may not be Tolkien ish, but it's still a good movie.",1397347200,2,3207,4.37983193277311

4635520,4,B0059XTU3G,"I had severe doubts that Peter Jackson, having made a smash hit
trilogy of films from ""Lord of the Rings"", a novel usually sold in 3
volumes (the third one admittedly being half appendices) could
POSSIBLY make a worthwhile TRILOGY of films out of ""The Hobbit"",
a precursor to Lord of the Rings, which was written much more on
an older-child level (as opposed to Lord of the Rings which plenty of
adults find fascinating).  And it was only one volume, not 3....

Well now I've seen Hobbit parts 1 and 2 (this being part 2) and
Jackson has made me a believer.  The story has been great to
watch through these first 2 films, and never seemed dull.

True, if you want to nit-pick, the dwarves are played a little too much
like comic relief (as was true of Gimli in the Lord of the Rings films)
and not like warriors or master-craftsmen.  The closest to ""serious""
would be Thorin Oakenshield.  If anything, they seem modeled on
a stereotype of Jewish merchants in Europe for centuries after the
diaspora (which would be OK considering the circumstances of the
novel, except for the downplaying of either their combat abilities or
craftsmanship...so, so far, the film I think would resonate well slightly
further down the age-scale than the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Nevertheless Peter Jackson has managed to flesh out a novel
incredibly well for a 3-film endeavor.

The last complaint I'd have (pertaining to versions on disc) is some
disappointment in the ""special features"".  Basically all I found was
a lot of day-to-day making-the-movie stuff, which usually is less
interesting to me than listening to the director, the script writer(s),
the musician, costume director or actors describing their thoughts
about translating the story into film; what they were thinking in
the choices they made, etc.  Special features on multiple versions
of the Lord of the Rings trilogy were some of the best I've seen.
These are not nearly as interesting.  But the story, the visuals,
the imagination, the energy, the pace, are all great.  I'm waiting
for the final installment.",1397260800,3,2063,4.849002849002849

4635532,5,B0059XTU3G,"The first Hobbit movie was on the edge of medium good. It just did not hit the mark. Do NOT Judge this movie at all based on the first Hobbit film. It looked and sounded terrific in my home theater. Every bit as intense and exciting as in the movies. Plus you get it in DVD, plus you get a ultra HD digital copy,plus a special features disc. Well worth every penny.

Our pack of dwarfs are heading for the mountain. They have a sleep over with a skin changer. One minute is a bear, the next a man. He hates dwarfs, and short people in general. He plays host for the evening, and in the morning pours the milk for their cereal. He then tells them he hates them, but not as much as he hates Orcs. So he gives them ponies, and rations and sends them on there way to the happiest place in the world, The Woods.

What does a wizard, a hobbit, and six pack of Dwarfs have in common? They are about to enter the Woodland Elves territory. Gandolph decides to leave the small people to hit the trail by themselves, as he has Bigger Issues to deal with. Bilbo finds his courage and they follow the yellow brick road deep into spooky territory. They feel inebriated after a long while of just staying on the path. They find a Dwarf-en wallet, and realized one of there group has dropped it. They are helplessly lost.

Bilbo climbes a tree, and sees the mountain ahead. He kinda falls down and finds the entire group has been wrapped, and ready to serve or an Arachnid TV Dinner. Bilbo goes invisible and starts to kill, and free his friends. Then is a non stop action sequence that goes on between Dwarfs, Elves, and spiders. They call in the exterminators, and Legolis now realizes Thorin holds an Elvish blade. They are called thieves and Imprisoned.

EPIC Barrel Ride ends and they meet a bargeman. bribe bargeman to take them to the city across the lake. Dwarf's attacked by sushi, and hide in a toilet. They arise one by one and are given meager weapons to fight on with. They wait till night fall, and decide to rob the armory. Butterfingers slips down the steps, and wakes up the town. They are gathered and brought to meet the mayor. Thorin promises Hope & change, and riches. The town embraces them, arms them with weapons forged in steel, and sends them to the mountain.

They climb a mountain which gives rock climbing a whole new meaning. They get to the top, wait for day's last light. Nothing lights up. Thorin acts like a sissy gives up, leaving Bilbo to figure things out. Bilbo does indeed. He calls them back, and they enter. Read hieroglyphics, and send Bilbo into the treasure room telling him to find 1 white jewel. Beware of dragon, and good luck. Bilbo enters the treasure room and finds a country landscaped with gold. No problem one small jewel in all this mess. He digs, and sleds, and knocks some gold till he wakes up smaug. Story time, but Smaug does not feel sleepy. Accusations fly, and Bilbo runs away. and, and, and to make a long story short.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone. No Review, let alone this one does this movie Justice. It really is marvelously acted, and directed. Stunning sound & special effects..",1397260800,3,3143,4.419689119170984

So how has Jackson done? Better than I thought, I must admit. The story is unashamedly padded, but the padding is well done, with much history from the annotations and footnotes of LOTR and The Hobbit. It seems that Jackson is relying more and more on CGI, which makes the movies feel less real than the LOTR trilogy. Jackson's camera is rarely still, but sometimes the kinetic energy is false, as in the over-long barrel-rider fighting sequence.

Gotta give him credit for Mirkwood, though. That was well done, except I missed the ""Attercop!' dialogue from the book.

The best way to enjoy this movie is to think of it as being inspired by the book, not based on the book. I would have liked a one-movie adaptation better, with Ian McKellen as the narrator.",1397260800,,971,4.601156069364162

4635572,5,B0059XTU3G,"I've read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings many times since I was first introduced to them in the mid 70's.
This imagining by Peter Jackson has a unique perspective.

For one, he creates an entire sub-plot that is only casually mentioned in the book (with The Necromancer.)
From other Tolkien sources we had learned later on the identity of him. Jackson puts this in the film and it works.

He also gives us more with the encounter with Smaug. In the book, only Bilbo has any interaction. I loved how Thorin and Company actually tried taking on the Last Dragon in Middle Earth. ""We don't HAVE a jiffy.""

Bombur has a few funny moments, although he has yet to speak!

Beorn could have been represented better, but I loved his Bear form. Can't wait for part 3, his appearance was always my favorite part in the book.

I wasn't happy that they split the Company up, leaving Fili, Kili, and a few others in Laketown, and the creation of the Sylvan Elf Tauriel is new, too. (Although the actress is BEAUTIFUL!)

There is a brief funny scene with Gloin and Legolas concerning his ""wee lad, Gimli""...I thought the Wood Elves were jerks, especially Thranduil, the King. Even Legolas seemed stiff. He obviously comes around in LOTR.

The ending with the Dwarves vs. Smaug was great. Watch for Smaugs' look of awe when he beholds the giant golden Dwarven King statue.
Benedict Cumberbatch has the PERFECT voice for Smaug.

Overall, a great film. I'd like to even see a last glimpse of Gollum leaving his cave to start the search for his Precious in the end.

In short, the film is guilty of trying to become more than it is, needless suspense and tension, needless expansions of themes, trying to cram three plots into one film -- and yet expanding the 'franchise' into three films, and on and on.

4635580,3,B0059XTU3G,"For those who have read the book and are expecting Tolkiens Hobbit, please know that you are getting Jackson's Hobbit instead.

Hobbit 2 begins out of time sequence; unclarified, the first scene is BEFORE The Hobbit 1, but the value of this scene is an enigma.  Its like 'oops, we forgot this scene in Hobbit 1 so lets stick it here'

Suddenly the film jumps to after The Hobbit 1, nicely titled as '12 months later' which also happens to equal 1 year later, but thats technical.

Packed with glamorous, exaggerated combat scenes copied from The Matrix with the silliness of Jackie Chan, mixed in is also some James Bond cable climbing, it is ridiculous and immature.  One loses all fear of Orcs; these are obviously not dangerous creatures to anyone, like mosquitoes you swat them down 50:1 without breaking a sweat. After a 5 minute fight scene with Jackie Chan style stunts the actors look like they just exited the hair-dresser.  Funny, in the book I thought Orcs were dangerous, or is Jackson's fame turning him Hollywood cheesy?

The flirting of a Dwarf with a she-Elf takes far too long and again the value is unclear and not present in Tolkiens Hobbit.  Did Jackson add some Hollywood romance so Moms wouldnt get too bored?  Extra material is not needed to make this long story interesting, yet Mr. Jackson burns time creating themes not in the book at the expense of rushing what actually is in the book.

Much of the real story is rushed, if you know what the story is you will notice.  It feels very compressed yet the invented scenes are long.  Hire an editor, please!

The good:  the animation of Smaug is most impressive and absolute high-point of this film.  I won't ruin it for you, but watch the whole film just for this.  The actors are mostly superb too and carry the film along.

To a Tolkien-fan its a disappointingly goofy film, not comparable in quality to Lord of the Rings; but all good things come to an end.  Mr. Jackson is doing to Tolkien what George Lucas eventually did to Star Wars; anyone take those seriously anymore after Jar Jar Binks?

Of course you will watch the film purely out of obligation to see all Tolkien-related films.  Its not a bad film, but its not pure Tolkien either.",1397174400,,2219,4.583756345177665

Many people disagree or are too blinded by their anger of the straying from the book, but you have to look at it from a cinematography point of view as well. It does entertain and yes can be frustrating with changes from the book but it does not take away from its enjoyment. Not all books can or should be put on film excactly how they are written, it wouldn't make a good movie in some cases.",1397174400,2,444,4.174418604651163

But hooh boy did the screen writers screw up!
Dwarf-on-Elf love, annoying white orcs everywhere and running wild in Laketown, the dwarfs splitting up just like that, Bilbo forgetting he has a magic ring, slapstick action in barrels, the return of Radagast the Bird-S***ty, Angry Legolas (Legolas?!?), toilet-diving - and the list goes on and on.

If Jackson wanted to make a gory, fantasy film...have at it...but to ruin the one and only chance, most Tolkien fans will have to see the book they read as children brought to ""life"" centered on gore and warfare...I personally could cry.  Dwarves left behind in Laketown?!?!?!?!?! Orcs constantly on the Dwarves heels?!?!?!?! A love story between an Elf and a Dwarf?!?!?!?!?!?!

I called the basis of the third installment at the end of the first installment?  Three hours of the War of the Five Armies, with 5 minutes at the end of Bilbo seeing Thorin before Thorin dies, and Bilbo heads for home.

Let me guess...the white orc is the one who kills Thorin!!!!  I'm a genius!!!!!

I highly doubt I will even waste my money to buy the third installment.  I figure with how much I fast forwarded through this segment, there won't be anything but the last five minutes to watch in the third part.

4635650,3,B0059XTU3G,"While Peter Jackson did superbly with the LOTR trilogy, he is floudering a bit with The Hobbit.

Part of this stems from the fact he's stretching a single book into 3 epic films.  While this worked brilliantly with the LOTR Trilogy, here we get a lot of parts that drag on and a non-ending.  Aslo, filming at the higher framerate really did nothing for the film.  It neither added nor subtracted from the visuals as a whole.

As we continue from where the first film stopped, we get a few points that Tolkien purists will find annoying.  Legolas, although a major character in the LOTR Trilogy, was barely present in The Hobbit.  Mr Jackson however decided that he needed to give Orlando Bloom more to do so he beefed up the character's role in this 2nd film.  We have a small love story between one of the Dwarves and a new female elf character.  Personally, this didn't bother me much, though purists will say it was never in the book,  You could delete the entire scenes as it adds nothing to the story as a whole, seemingly added to ""fill out"" the movie to a longer runtime.

Gandalf has an encounter that we know he'll get out of since he's in the Trilogy later on.  Yet, Jackson plays it up like Gandalf's fate is unknown until the 3rd part is released.

There are numerous scenes that could of been shortened but Jackson kept long to keep the runtime up.  The whole ""river barrel"" part could of been greatly shortened but lasted several mintues.  This is one example where I was thinking ""yes I get it, let's pick up the pace now"".

The ending, as such, is more of an abrupt stopping point.  Since this movie is basically the latter part of the book, Jackson had to find some point to just stop the movie.  This gives the audience a jarring cliff-hanger-ish ending.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film.  Not as much as the Trilogy though.  I would *strongly* recommend not buying The Hobbit films til all 3 are available on DVD/Blu-ray, so you can watch them as a complete movie rather than the incomplete individual ones.",1397088000,,2033,4.470108695652174

As for the 3D, well most of the 3D movies I have seen and this one was no exception all looked like the pop up books I had as a child so it wasn't impressive.  This was seen with pretty high quality Samsung 3D glasses but the 3D effects are just disorienting and when I found myself focusing more on focusing than on watching the movie unfold the 3D experience was over for me.

With that... everything just either feels forced (Legolas and the whole love triangle thing with what's-her-face) or retread. There are so many shots in this movie, just like the first Hobbit movie, that feel like we've seen it all before in the previous trilogy, but not done quite as well.

Everything is much more crisp and clear this time around. I was pretty impressed by this. It really lent itself to full viewing immersion. The 3D was pretty cool as well. Even the DVD's seemed to have a better resolution that previous discs I've watched. So, the quality is definitely there. I kind of wish the DVD;s had there own separate case like they did with the first Hobbit, but that is a minor personal gripe that doesnt impact the quality at all.

I did like tauriel the female elf they added. For someone who has played the hobbit pc game countless times she reminded me a lot of the female elf in the game (sadly I have forgotten her name.) I also liked the fact that Thranduil's castle looks a lot like the one on the pc game.
It was nice seeing another side of legolas as well other then the delicate elf that his character portrayed in the lord of the rings movie series. It was nice seeing him kick butt.
I also like the fact that they are showing gandalf's conflict with the Necromancer of Dol Guldur. Since J.R.R. Tolkien never went into detail with this in the book.
So other then the fact that it wasn't much like the book I still like it a lot and it was worth the wait. Can't wait until the final hobbit movie comes out. Hopefully it won't take another years wait to see it.",1397001600,,1036,4.211055276381909

Number 2: Upon first watching this movie, I was slightly disturbed by the added characters and scenes that were not in Tolkien's book. However, the added content does fit within the world Tolkien created and the movement of his original plot. The biggest differences between the book and the movie were the added character Tauriel, captain of the wood elves' guard, a fight scene between the dwarves, elves and orcs as the dwarves floated down the river in open-topped barrels, and a scene in which the dwarves were stuck inside the Lonely Mountain trying to outsmart Smaug in order to escape. The added scenes certainly create more action, which is fun to watch considering the detail of the shots and stunts and the almost seamless integration of practical and CG effects. The only reason I didn't give The Desolation of Smaug 5 stars is because it strayed from the book enough to say the accuracy suffered.",1397001600,,1060,4.797814207650274

I did like that they briefly included Beorn in the movie.  However, I didn't want to see characters added by Jackson that were never in Tolkien's book, nor do many of the scenes take place as portrayed in the movie--not to mention wholly invented scenes to drag this 300-page book out to be a trilogy of nearly 3 hours each...

Many of the changes are thrown in to create yet more eye-candy and cgi-generated fight scenes...when they travel down the river in barrels to escape the elves in the book they are sealed up in the barrels, in this movie the barrels are open and they fight with the orcs all down the river in a drawn out fight sequence.

Even Stephen King in response to some of his books being changed when made into movies (keep in mind most changes were minor), made the comment something to the effect of we are giving you steak not hamburger, so it's really something better...well, that is not the case with this Hobbit trilogy so far.  I don't care if you are giving me filet mignon, if I want rice and beans, I don't care about filet mignon...For once couldn't he stick to the story and create that (even if it only yields a single film)!

4635749,5,B0059XTU3G,"""The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Bilbo Baggins continues his journey with the Wizard Gandalf and thirteen Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, on an epic quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor. Having survived the beginning of their unexpected journey, the Company continues East, encountering along the way the skin-changer Beorn and a swarm of giant Spiders in the treacherous forest of Mirkwood. After escaping capture by the dangerous Wood-elves, the Dwarves journey to Lake-town, and finally to the Lonely Mountain itself, where they must face the greatest danger of all-a creature more terrifying than any other; one which will test not only the depth of their courage but the limits of their friendship and the wisdom of the journey itself-the Dragon Smaug.

The cast led by Ian McKellen (still great as Gandalf), Martin Freeman (also still great as Bilbo) & Richard Armitage (still solid as Thorin) is excellent. The directing by Peter Jackson (also produced and co-wrote the screenplay) is excellent. The screenplay (based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit"") by Jackson, Fran Walsh (also produced), Philippa Boyens (also co-produced) & Guillermo Del Toro (also was a project consultant on all 3 films in ""The Hobbit"" trilogy) is excellent.

The music by Howard Shore is excellent. The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie is excellent. The film editing by Jabez Olssen is excellent. The casting by Victoria Burrows, Amy Hubbard, John Hubbard, Liz Mullane & Miranda Rivers is excellent. The production design by Dan Hennah is excellent. The art direction by Andy McLaren is excellent. The set decoration by Ra Vincent, set designs by John Lott, Mark Stephen, Gavin Urquhart & Richard Wiles is excellent. The costume design by Bob Buck, Ann Maskrey & Richard Taylor is excellent. The prosthetics make-up effects by Peter King & supervised by Tami Lane is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Glenn Boswell & fights coordinated by Steven McMichael & Paul Shapcott is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Phil McLaren & supervised by Wily Tyight is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Sophie Cherry, Siobhan Durkin, Tom Greene & La-Ra Hinckeldeyn & supervised by Matt Aitken, Jeff Capogreco, Darwin Go, Eric Saindon, Charles Tait & Joe Letteri is excellent.

This is an impressive and excellent follow-up to ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" and also keeping in line with ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, as well. This is also better than ""An Unexpected Journey"", in terms of quality and pacing, just as well-made, thematically and visually, and as well as well-acted, too. Peter Jackson has made another terrific and entertaining follow-up that is almost in line with ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers"" in terms of follow-up films to film franchises.

My only problem with this (spoiler alert for those who haven't seen this yet) movie was the fact that Smaug didn't EVEN get to destroy the town!  I was REALLY angry that they didn't include this in ""The Desolation Of Smaug""!  And left me hanging until December 2014 for that.  I have waited for a live action movie for them to show this since the original cartoon version milenia ago.
  OK enough about what I thought was bad.  The Overall movie was very good.  The acting was great.  They get into the heart of the Dwarves delema.  The action scenes were great.  Especially when the Dwarves & Bilbo get to Mirkwood.  Even though most of the Mirkwood theatrics were not actually in the original book.  And it has expaned on that item.  Also, the fact that they are tying in alot of the Hobbit in with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Which is I think an excellent idea to do.

The action and scenery are excellent in this movie. There is a nice fill in of some of the missing story omitted in the first movie before returning to the real time storyline. I'm not sure Legolas was a wood elf in the original story but so what. I liked this better than the first movie and look forward to the final film in the series.

4635764,5,B0059XTU3G,"It is important to remember that the film adaptations of The Hobbit are the work and vision of Peter Jackson and his team, based upon (though not exclusively) on the earlier vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Personally I will always consider Tolkien's own vision superior to that of Jackson and Company, but I do find many aspects of the films to be pleasing, chiefly those which adhere most closely to Tolkien's own writings.  The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug suffers the inevitable fate of any middle film in a trilogy in that it seems to have an abrupt beginning and no clear ending, but nevertheless I saw much that I as a forty year long Tolkien fan consider appealing.

This two DVD special edition contains several production videos and part 2 of a travelogue/film accompaniment of New Zealand along with the movie itself.  My chief interest lies in the movie itself.  I found the sets and settings for Mirkwood, the Wood Elves' cave, Laketown, and Erebor to be beautiful, mysterious, and majestic.  I enjoyed the range of accents, from the Eastern European sounding Beorn to the multiple voices and languages to be heard in Laketown, a port city and entrepot with a population drawn from many lands.  The characters of Beorn, Thranduil, Bard, and the oily Master of Laketown (as portrayed by Stephen Fry) are superbly acted.  Best of all was the dragon Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and wonderfully evil.

These strengths balance the weaknesses: the dependence on Indiana Jones style stunts, the neglect of some of the characters' finer points, the introduction of ideas and characters alien to the book, including most notably Tauriel (who, to do her justice, does convincingly voice the Elven love of stars and nature.) While I will always prefer the book to these films, I do believe that Peter Jackson has done a credible job of transferring his vision of Middle-earth to the screen.  While his vision differs from my own, I do find it an intriguing and often positive one.  I will watch The Desolation of Smaug, its predecessor and its successor, many times in the future.",1396915200,3,2089,4.872881355932203
4635765,2,B0059XTU3G,"It seems to me that one of the plagues on screen entertainment in the past two decades has been the substitution of special effects and hip action scenes for solid performances, character development, plot continuity and meaningful dialogue.  This is most evident in adaptations of novels to movies, premieres and remakes alike.  This movie series was not an exception.

The target audience of Tolkien's first Middle Earth novel was children, primarily his own.  In Jackson's original production scheme, the Hobbit never really figured in.  Jackson's LOTR movies, while significantly adapted for the big screen, retained enough of the novels' classicism and enchantment for even the most diehard fans to overlook this.  This adaptation, which I believe Jackson wisely resisted producing for some time, possessed none of those qualities, nor did characters develop beyond shallow stereotypes, the plot unwind sensibly and engrossingly, or dialogue convey anything of epic substance.  If you compare episodes IV-VI to I-III of the Star Wars saga, you might see some parallels.  On the other hand, if you enjoyed Star Wars episodes I-III more than IV-VI, you might appreciate the Hobbit movies more than the LOTR films.

It was a shame that Jackson chose to adapt the Hobbit for a broader audience by making it a showcase for technologies and contemporary values which didn't really add anything to the screen presentation of the story.  By attempting to immerse viewers in a hi-definition, 3D-driven presentation rather than an emotionally engaging plot, he failed miserably in his role as storyteller.  Fantasy stories are not about what the eyes see, rather what sublime otherwordliness touches mind and heart.  We relate to that different otherworld through heroic themes of courage, sacrifice, honor, compassion - evident in Tolkien's novel, not so much in this movie.  The central themes were even further obscured by the flood of superficially-treated, unfocused characterizations  which lent nothing of value to the story.  Then add filler plot points which were never in the novel, like Smaug's seeming knowledge of the One Ring, Gandalf's encounter with Sauron at Dol Guldur, a bunny-propelled wizard mentioned only in the LOTR, and a killer she-elf with a budding dwarf fetish, and you have nothing left to hold on to except the endless chase scenes, which became quite monotonous in this second of three disappointments.

While the first movie had some redeeming features and offered hope of better things to come, this second installment was awful enough to dampen any hopes that the third movie could redeem the other two.  For me, it was a waste of time and money.  I don't say this because it wasn't true to the novel - a good story is a good story, and I'm open to new and wonderful things.  The Desolation of Smaug is a disappointment because it fails on its own lack of virtue as a story.  I believe that Peter Jackson's heart was not in this endeavor, and its pointless extension to three vapid  segments pegs it as a wallet-liner.  Dime Novel Dickens would have been proud!",1396915200,5,3091,5.091269841269841
4635766,5,B0059XTU3G,"For those who claim this doesn't either follow the book or does so rarely, should go back and re-read Tolkien's works. Even for a child's tale ""The Hobbit"" is a fairly detailed work, and what few movies ever made were always a brief cliff notes version of the story. Granted, Peter Jackson did take liberties with this story and have added some elements that were not in the original story. However, I tend to view this version as the one Tolkien didn't tell to kids, while the other versions, including the book itself as something he wrote, as a tale to entertain kids, the way an old soldier might tell a particular war tale, glossing over some of the more sensitive and frightening aspects of it so as not to scare them. This movie would be one he might relate to adults if he felt so inclined. The Spiders here have none of the humorous aspects seen in the other movies, and Thorin has every right to distrust the Elves and does have disdain for Hobbits, and why should Legolas not have a love interest? This movie expands more into the characters and what we don't see in the books. As to why Smaug proves highly intelligent? He is a Dragon, one of many created by Morgoth in Ancient Days, devised to be Wise, cruel and steeped in evil as well as wielding the power of fire and with a terrible proclivity for seeking and claiming the wealth of others. Here, he and Bilbo share a wonderful scene that is quite compelling to watch. In fact, one could say that Smaug is terrifying as he questions Bilbo about his name. In the original tale, Bilbo was alone, but here, the Dwarves were struck by a brief bout of gold sickness before they try to take on the Dragon.

Just a really good adventure and I'm glad we'll get one more film out of it. While Smaug definitely gets some good screen time, I'm still waiting for a good Balrog type moment in between the big moments.

a) at first glance, there's only Flixster digital copy.  Everything I do is within iTunes, so that sucks.  Did I miss something in the material?

b) The first minute or so, the audio/video sync appears to be slightly off.

c) The 3D version is split onto 2 disks.  I understand that, however, the split is not at a good segue like a fade between scenes, it's in the middle of a conversation within a scene.  How stupid is that?",1396915200,5,971,4.150537634408602

This part is from when the group escapes the Orcs and Goblin Mountain, through the elf kingdom, to the River city and of course the halls of the dwarven kingdom and face to face with the dragon himself.  This movie is a little more fast paced as the director needed to build the momentum towards the final part of the series.  Now as a movie adaptaion there will be things that are not in the book, elaborated (like the prision of the Nazgul and the faceoff against the Necromancer), or made up (the ""interest"" of the female elf and the dwarf - but still its a better love story than Twilight).  The new characters introduced were just as i pictured them - from the elf king to Brom the Archer.  Legolas makes his appearance, but was more expanded than in the book.  But my favorite was the creation of Smaug - the animation and CGI was beautiful, from when he rose from the coins  to when he took of to attack Rivertown.

4635840,1,B0059XTU3G,"After reading so many positive reviews of this one I thought it was time that someone set the record straight.
TL;DR This movie sucks.

I wish I could say something other than that, maybe something positive but in the end I think that saying anything positive about this film would be an insult to my intelligence and yours, but who knows, maybe something will seep in. Here we go then.

The film opens on Peter Jackson still eating the carrot from Fellowship thus proving that his character is an immortal man-like person who hangs around the vicinity of the Old Forest, wait a minute, HE'S TOM BOMBADIL! Oh, we're ignoring that and having a melodramatic scene between Gandalf and Thorin showing us a useless scene that was already implied. Then were are treated to the cast is running away from CGI monsters, they are then rescued by a CGI bear-man but this bear is different! This bear is a man, a man whose appearance is so strange that your brain simply can't decide if he's CGI too or just so badly enlarged by CGI that he loses any sense of reality. After a few moments of silence in the bear-man's house we see the group slip into the forests of Mirkwood where they begin to hallucinate. Bilbo then climbs a tree only to have the rest be attacked by spiders while he's up there. He comes down and we find the scary moment of the film sure to frighten the young children in the audience. After Bilbo loses the ring he begins to mercilessly stab the ickiest spider of them all and save his comrades who are only mildly impressed.
At this point we're introduced to Orlando Elf-boy Bloom who somehow manages to be worse at subtlety than he was in the first trilogy. He takes the dwarves to Elf jail and we meet Kate from Lost. Kate from Lost is attracted to No-Beard Youngdwarf and they flirt for a few minutes before Bilbo comes up with a plan. Bilbo manages to get the dwarves out of the prison to where the barrels are stationed. He throws the dwarves into some barrels and he then proceeds to disappear for the next hour of the film.
We are then treated to the barrel chase scene with CGI elves and CGI orcs and CGI Orlando Elf-boy Bloom jumping around with CGI barrel dwarves. It all looks pretty, even when the camera inexplicably cuts to a GoPro camera for those first-person shots that everyone was a major fan of in the first trilogy. The dwarves finally escape but not before No-Beard Youngdwarf is shot with an evil arrow, which everyone seems content to ignore. We then are taken to Lake Town, a city so boring that we need Unibrow Man and his sidekick Sir Farts-a-Lot to liven things up with some commentary on Big Government.
After sticking around for thirty minutes or so the dwarves leave, forcing No-Beard to stay behind because he has a leg wound that no one treated. As they leave they get to the mountain, only to have the spell not work and they leave immediately because traveling thousands of miles ain't even a thing, but wait! Bilbo sees it in a way completely different from how Frodo alone was able to figure out the Moria Gate riddle. They get inside and Thorin suddenly drops all character development he'd received up to this point, making the first film irrelevant. He wants Bilbo to go inside alone, or else he'll kill him.
Meanwhile back at Boring Town we see Kate from Lost show up in time to deliver some elf magic to No-Beard in a way that isn't similar to Arwen saving Frodo at all. At the same time Bilbo has been talking to Sherlock and Sherlock's been pretty scary. He gives himself a prep talk and Bilbo inexplicably slips the ring on and off before running after the Tesseract-Stone of Destiny which he loses (ie it's in his pocket).
We are then treated to a 45 minute Benny Hill chase scene with the dwarves and CGI Sherlock through CGI Not-Moria. They then hatch a plan that involves Thorin riding on a shield on top of lava and a careful hope that Sherlock will stand in awe of a statue and not burn everyone to death, which he does. Then, surprise! The fire-breathing dragon wasn't burned to death in lava, who knew!?
Then we get a scene of the dragon flying off while Bilbo is sad. Roll credits and worse credits song yet.
Oh and Gandalf fought the necromancer who is, surprise! Sauron. A spinning silhouette Sauron, who is actually the eye and fights Gandalf in a way that is in no way similar to Gandalf's fight with Saruman.

So if I didn't manage to scare anyone off I now want to go over some of my biggest problems with the film.
1. Why is Bilbo being corrupted by the ring so quickly? Bilbo is going to have this thing for another 60 years and he's only really bad off in the end, during the spider scene Biblo is clearly being tempted by the ring hard core.
2. Beorn, in the book Beorn is a likable bear-man who hangs with the dwarves for a while and would have added some much needed pleasantness to an otherwise dark world.
3. The Barrel Scene, I could say so much about this but all I can say in the end was that this was completely unneeded. CGI Legolas adds no danger to the scene, we're not scared for him because we know he lives and so we're treated to bouncing and stunts that side on stupidity with Legolas and with the fat dwarf who rolls into orcs and spins around.
4. The Master of Lake Town and lover, these two might be the worst. Jackson decided he was going to have them there as a commentary on big government, they add nothing to the film and only serve to remind us this is a movie.
5. Smaug's over-uselessness, the first 5 minutes of this scene I liked, it was almost straight from the book and Martin is really selling that he's afraid. Strangely though this scene continues and we're treated to a 15 minute word-battle between Smaug and Bilbo before slipping into the stupidest chase scene in the series. If Smaug seemed scary he shouldn't after this since he apparently can't kill a single dwarf in his lair.
6. Thorin character completely loses all character development in the third act of the film. I get it, he's going to die in the next one and needs to be redeemed. But if that's the case then why did we have the first film center around Bilbo wanting him to like him? Why did we need any of that if we just threw it away.
7. Gandalf's fight, let me make this clear. Magic in Middle Earth is not normal magic. It isn't muttering spells and stuff like that it is more subtle. Apparently no one in the audience would understand that though so we are treated to a fight between Gandalf and Sauron that borders on ridiculous and ends identically to how Gandalf's fight with Saruman ended. I guess everything is supposed to rhyme, where have I heard that before?
8. The Black Arrow (not Bard's one), this may have been among the worst parts of the film. Kili is shot with an arrow in the leg. Everyone ignores it till they get to Lake Town then they realize that it was an evil arrow and that Kili will soon become a wraith. I need to clarify something. Orc arrows are poisoned on their own, they're tipped with orc blood. This would have been enough but for some reason this arrow had to be the same as the blade that stabbed Frodo. We then see Tauriel come in and do some elf magic after using the exact same line about Kingsfoil as in Fellowship. Here's where it gets geeky. Tauriel is not the same type of elf Arwen is. Arwen did the elf magic because she is in the vicinity of a high elf, the type of elf Tauriel is cannot do this form of elf magic as, once again magic is not a spell.
9. CGI-ification, There was a time when Jackson would have done as much as he possibly could with special effects and only used the CGI when it was necessary, but for some reason (money) Jackson decided that CGI looked better (it doesn't) the CGI effects in this movie range from incredible to looking worse than in LoTR. It hurts me in the end, I understand it is necessary in some places but when it's everywhere it removes from the realism of the film and ultimately damages it.
10. Tauriel, this girl was a waste of time. I understand why they needed her. With three production companies working on this film it is obvious some studio executive said they needed a female character to appeal to women, and so we are stuck with Kate from Lost. Tauriel on her own isn't a problem, what is a problem is the implied romance between her and Kili. Listen, Kili is going to die in the next film, this is a ploy to make you sad when he does. However it is essentially lore-breaking. The only dwarf that liked elves was Gimli and everyone thought he was strange for it. Kili doing it removes anything special about Gimli, which brings me to
11. Gimli, the scene with Gimli may have been funny to some but ultimately Gimli is 60 during the events of the Hobbit. Now wait you'll say, that must be young for dwarves! Well in answer I point to Fili and Kili who are both around 80. The fact that Gloin apparently refers to his son as a ""wee lad"" implies that he is a child, this scene is dumb and Orlando Bloom's bad acting doesn't make it any better.

So in the end here are my feelings. Jackson has somehow made the same mistakes as Lucas. He's surrounded himself with yes men and he's forgotten himself. He's fallen in love with CGI and the film suffers for it. He has taken source material and used it as toilet paper all for the sake of money. I hope it was worth it, we have essentially doomed any legitimate fantasy films for the next decade because now every film is going to try to be the Hobbit, much like every film for the last decade tried to be LoTR. There's nothing to be done for it and the film industry will continue to decline. I hope it was worth it. When films are all the same in 5 years...

I do not have nearly the same attatchment and draw towards the movie like its predecssors trilogy. Also there is a little too much CGI that looks even cheesy at tines and takes away from it looking like it could really exist. Although I must say Smaug was well done but some of these orces among other things just do not look asthetically pleasing than the last trilogy. It is an entertaining, watchable movie but it just is not as epic as or probably should be. I understand it is not quite as epic as Lord of the rings but Peter Jackson seems to be taken some luxuries here and not making the same mystic and awe from his original trilogy. The cast I believe is just fine but I do not think they are implemented quite as well as they should be. Also Beorn was somewhat dissapointing asthetically with a kindof lame CGI that doesn't really look like a bear so much. This movie just lacks the magic of the originals and I think could have been a little better. Some things seem a little forced with the whole Legolas Tauriel Fili love triangle which takes away from the story. I think it is ill fitted and just is kind of cheesy even.

The usual fantastic effects bring the Hobbit to life and the performances are as good expected from such a seasoned group.  However the telling of the story suffers from being stretched too thin.  PJ should have stuck to his guns and made the movie in 2 parts each at around 2 hours apiece.  Compressing the long sequences would have made for a much better movie and made it more exciting!

4635931,3,B0059XTU3G,"I'm a Tolkien fan, so the second Hobbit film is superbly rendered and presented. That said I still maintain that they really could have done this work in two movies. Three is excessive and not a lot of people really care about all the backstory (derived from other Tolkien works I might add). So I won't rate it 5 stars. There is also a little too much tangential additions. Legolas is the son of Thranduil (King of the Wood Elves) but he never appears in the Hobbit. Tauriel is a complete fabrication too, though with the limited female presences in most of Tolkien's novels I don't think it is too big a problem and Evangeline Lilly is a superb actor and eye candy to boot.

My favourite part is Smaug, brilliant CGI and Erebor is very well conceived. Martin Freeman really does a good Bilbo, especially when one recognises the Ian Holm mannerisms.

Finally this film is far better in HD so pony up the cash for the HD version if your setup can deal with it.",1396483200,,960,4.418079096045198

 My Hubby and I love to snuggle to a good movie each evening, and when TV has nothing to offer, we can always watch these movies again and again. Never tiring because you always catch something you missed the last time you saw it. We never tire of submersing ourselves in this fantasy (with a lot of truth story) when we settle down for the evening.
 It will be fun to make this into one of our movie marathon weekends in the Winter. (on snowy days we just relax and watch all the movies in the series. With Popcorn.

Honor and justice like it used to be with the pain and suffering one had to endure to make life livable. A lot of chivalry and action.  Loved the ""Skin Changer,"" or ""Shape-shifter"" .  The dwarves who try to be serious ...most of the time are quite funny at times.  I love the part where Legolas gets a hold of ""Gloin's "" locket with a pic of his family and points out ""Gimli"".  When Legolas ask about the creature in the locket he says, ""That is my wee son.""  I was laughing so hard.",1396396800,2,650,4.03125

I'll be buying the extended version when it comes out too.  The only downside to The Desolation of Smaug, was the liberties that Jackson took from the book.  A little bit is okay, but the escape down the river was a somewhat over the top.  Other than that, it was thrilling.  Can't wait for the sequel.",1396396800,,425,4.25

Probably the best on screen rendition of Smaug we will ever see, Cumberbatch could probably voice the rock dude off of never ending story and make it my favorite character .  And i can forgive the ending considering this is a trilogy. Given the source material I believe Peter Jackson and crew did a great job. The deviation from the books to pad out the time also seemed like it should have been there.

4635963,4,B0059XTU3G,"The acting is incredible in all of the Tolkien-based films. Smaug is amazing. My biggest complaint, as a Tolkien lover, is that Jackson has taken so much liberty with the book. For anyone who loved Tolkien's original work, this movie will seem somewhat unrecognizable. Even the events that Jackson got right, he still changed them significantly. Jackson continues to hint at the corrupting nature of the ring. The problem here is that in the books, Bilbo will have kept the ring for 61 years before leaving it to Frodo. If Bilbo were able to keep it that long and not turn into a Gollum-like creature, it is hard to believe that the ring could already effect him that much.

The movie got a four-star rating because if you weigh the movie by itself, it is a great film but too different from Tolkien to warrant a five-start rating. Ian McKellen is amazing as always. Martin Freeman really brings Bilbo to life. Ken Stott is wonderful as Balin. In fact, all of the actors playing dwarves are wonderful. The casting, in general, is spot on. For anyone interested in a fun romp through Middle Earth, this is a great choice. Tolkien read this to his children as he developed the story, and he wrote it for children. So, viewers of all ages can sit back and enjoy the journey.",1396396800,2,1271,4.574561403508772

4635980,4,B0059XTU3G,I have pretty much always been a fan of Peter Jackson's films and the current batch of Hobbit films are no exception. The movies themselves are stunningly beautiful and engagingly fun. That being said I have also always had a problem with the way the films have been presented for home release. They offer the vanilla theatrical version first and then roughly six months later they put out an extended edition and if I want them both I either have to spend the extra money to buy it twice or wait (possibly for years) until a combo version is released. All of this is in my opinion a ploy to make more money which they are perfectly entitled to do it just frustrates me to no end. If they were to release all three options at the same time at incrementally higher price points I would gladly purchase the combo version for the no doubt highest price. I give this four out of five simply for my displeasure of having to wait to get what I really want.,1396310400,,950,4.342696629213483

I wish the show would stick more to the book but it's kind of neat to see how they mix and match and add to make new scenes. From the spiders to the elf dungeon to the barrels and the trip down the river it doesn't follow the book very much. But it is really awesome. Laketown is a typical little burg with it's own problems. Bard isn't really what you would expect from the book. Maybe a bit better than that. The adventures in Erebor once they enter the door are quite different than the book. Bilbo's part is pretty close to the book but after that things change.

A terrible script, dark and dull from start to finish.  Nothing proves the corruption of the critics and their enslavement than any who gave this a positive review.  Its not that certain parts are changed, its that anything with any lightness was left out.  Since the Hobbit is a light children's tale, that pretty much means the whole story with the exception that there is a dragon, a ring, and 13 Dwarfs.  Mr. Jackson, why not just be honest and call this ""the Lord of Boring, the Prequel""

On a positive note, at least the butchery of this, leaves it open for someone with a sense of humor to remake it in the future, since this is by no means a definitive version.",1396224000,10,841,4.346153846153846

4636044,4,B0059XTU3G,"In the Lord of the Rings, we got to finally see J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece finally come mostly to life.  I was happy to see it.  Nevertheless, there were plenty of changes made to the story by Peter Jackson and Co..  For example, I'm pretty sure the phrase ""NOT THE BEARD!"" was nowhere in any of the books.  But, it was mostly Tolkein and we all enjoyed it.

The Hobbit is a different thing though.  For whatever reason, (A.K.A. $money$) PJ decided to turn the one book into three movies and not just one.  So, instead of seeing a nice, clear and concise retelling of perhaps the most beloved of any book in the world, we have a long drawn-out and complicated series of movies instead.

So, of course, when you're determined to tell a story in 9 hours that only needs 3 hours to tell...you have to put in a lot of extra stuff.  A lot of extra stuff.  Bunches and bunches.  What the heck, let's even toss in a few entirely new characters as well.

That's the new Hobbit.  Think of it as someone taking a really good photo of the Mona Lisa, cutting out their favorite parts of it, and then pasting it into a really big picture frame with a whole bunch of other stuff that Da Vinci never intended.

If you're hoping to see the same Hobbit you read when you were a kid, you'll be disappointed.  I was.  If you can get past PJ's audaciousness and instead just see the Hobbit for what it is, just a movie, you can enjoy it.  They did a good job incorporating the portion of the Hobbit they chose to use with all of the other stuff they felt like throwing in.  Thumbs up.

The crux of the problem with this movie, as well as the first installment, is that they're trying to make a trilogy of a single book, and it feels that way.  The CGI and costumes are not up to snuff.  There are some fine actors doing fine work in this film, but it just drags on despite their best efforts.

But for everyone else it is great fun, great story and leaves you waiting impatiently for the next one. The elf fighting scenes are incredible! Breath taking scenery as usual. There are some interesting and subtle ties to the first series; like the son of one of the dwarfs is Gimley in the Lord Of The Rings  series but in this one he is a photo of a child.

I only give it 3 stars because of the superb acting of this very talented cast.  Richard Armitage is great as Thorin, and Martin Freeman is perfect - he is simply the quintessential Bilbo.  Among the dwarves, Adam Brown slays me as Ori.  I wasn't terribly put off by An Unexpected Journey.  Despite the unneccessary subplot, it still felt like I was watching The Hobbit.  But this one is so far removed that there were only a few times when I though:  Hey, this is a scene right out of the book!

The handling of Beorn was unforgivable.  Unforgivable.  Then there's Tauriel.  While authentically elven, I can't help but think she's there to sell merchandise to little girls.  There are some things they changed that I can understand, like their encounter with the wood elves, and the expanded role of Bard and the little subplot of the town on the lake, to lift the story out of the simplicity of a children's book, but they've gone too far.

4636114,3,B0059XTU3G,"Ok, so before the so-called ""Purists' on either side start to rip me apart, just calm down.  The movie was ok for a sword & sorcery/fantasy adventure movie.  It should not have had ""The Hobbit"" anywhere in the title!  Neither should the first for that matter.  Peter Jackson takes too many liberties with the Tolkien License to mold it into his shape and vision, not what Tolkien himself created.  Hence the title of my review.  Tolkien ""Purists"" who have read the hobbit and his other works of fiction, will have also read his notes and journals on the world he created.  There is never mention of about 50% of the things that appear in Jackson's movies.  Which is why he should have just ""borrowed"" the Hobbit concept and made his own movie outside of the franchise.

And seriously, did the Hobbit, a book that is meant for children and is only about 300 pages, really need to be a trilogy? IMHO, no.  nearly 3 hours for the 2nd movie was too much.  It  dragged at times and the beginning just seemed a repeat of the end of the first one, minus the hawks.  It would probably would have been wiser, and more logical, to have made only two movies, taking out a lot of the useless ""extra"" things added for the story(Turial, Legolas, and the whole love triangle was really unnecessary).

Again, these are only my musings and opinions, but I am sure some people will feel the need to bash.  It wasn't a bad movie, I just think a more appropriate title would be ""Peter Jackson's Version Of The Hobbit ( A Fan Fiction Movie Based On J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit)"".",1395964800,4,1558,4.475177304964539

But if he hadn't, the movie would have primarily been the group walking from the Shire to the Lonely Mountain. This would have caused the movie to fail. By adding in ""unnecessary"" (as some say) scenes, it brings in more viewers who would have skipped this otherwise.

Another thing is the length of this movie; it goes on, and on, and on. I seriously don't think that 'The Hobbit' needed to be three movies! If the story had stuck closer to the book, it could have (and in my opinion, should have) been one really good movie.

4636127,4,B0059XTU3G,"The Amazon Instant Video version of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaugis a solid attempt to offer the film though, obviously, it won't have as many special features as the DVD versions. This is a far better film than Unexpected Journey and, if it doesnt capture the same magic as the Lord of the Rings films, it is still a good movie.

To be sure, J.R. R. Tolkien would not have recognized much of this film. Peter Jackson and company add a female elf, write in a member of the Fellowship, throw in a love story, shine light on Gandalfs activities, add much more focus on Laketown and flesh out the personalities of the various dwarves. This simply is not the Hobbit that readers have known for decades and viewers should go in aware of that.

There are some solid action scenes, some strange creatures and fascinating settings to be sure. But the movie does feel stretched out--a bit thin as Bilbo would have said in Fellowship of the Ring. Parts of the movie feel like fluff, not really needed to be sure, as some scenes simply go on too long.

But there are also very memorable scenes, including meeting Beorn and Biblos confrontation with Smaug. These carry the movie along. So do the fine performances by Martin Freeman as Bilbo, Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug and Richard Armitage as Thorin. Still, some of the best actors here get too little screen time including Ian McKellen continuing his iconic performance as Gandalf and Ken Stotts very solid job as Balin. Jacksons high definition filming proves much better in this film than it did the first Hobbit movie.

Despite some slow parts, this is a solid, if not great, film which picks up at the end when Smaug takes center stage. The cliff hanger ending left me wanting to see the third film as soon as possible.",1395878400,,1784,4.60062893081761

I know there is a huge diversion from the book, and I'm not even talking about how it falls short in comparison to that. I'm looking at it objectively without comparing it to the book (though it is difficult). The excessive brutality is exhausting. It's at an abusive quantity to the viewer - the brutality in LOTR at least made sense and was believable for the most part. I guess if you like action scenes this works for you, but I like some brains behind it all. The orcs constantly chasing them at every turn, the ridiculous love triangle (the jail scene and the trousers remark - give me a break), the whatever-that-was storyline in laketown, the predictability, the stupidity of the characters - even smaug the magnificent comes across as a dunce to me.

I see no beauty, no depth to the story (what is this about again? who cares), no character development. I wish smaug roasted them all, but apparently he is as inept as everyone else.

I'm glad there are people who enjoyed this film, but I wasn't one of them. I think I'll go watch the animated version from 1977.",1395792000,48,1327,4.543933054393306

This might be the best of the Tolkien movies yet.  Yeah, a bold statement--I know.  But this movie is a non-stop action adventure in which every scene is beautiful, every fight intricate and interesting, and every plot twist thrilling.  It improves upon the book so much, I could not be happier.

I wanted more blood and gore, but the fights have quite a few severed heads and brutal clashes to please even the most picky action fan.  Let me tell you this: these action sequences you WILL want to watch over and over!  Superbly done.

Of course, each character is brought to life by unique and exquisite acting talents.  Even the lowly townspeople, orcs, and beasts have personalities that just bring this world to LIFE.

The film turns what could have been corny or childish into something terrifying.  For example, the giant spiders.  The dwarven escape from the wood elves' kingdom.  The skinchanger.  All are very scary and will have you on the edge of your seat.

And the addition of Tauriel and Legolas was an excellent idea.  A stroke of genius.  It is neat to see how different a person Legolas was before the LOTR.  Not the best of guys.  Tauriel bonds with a dwarf and brings the pain in a big way.

THIS is a movie you MUST BUY.  Even if you are only a casual Tolkien fan.  The movie is an enthralling epic that sweeps you in and never lets go.  Better than the first movie by ten-fold.

Together they kick many orc behinds as only elves can. Most of the other characters are just filler really, and the movie moves along at a brisk pace, but the real payoff is the last hour when the stupendous and enormous Smaug is introduced.

4636150,5,B0059XTU3G,"I've been thrilled with Jackson's Tolkien adaptations thus far. Over the last few decades, I've gotten to enjoy Middle Earth through Rankin-Bass, Tolkien and Jackson-y glory and I, for one, am only glad for every format in its own right.

Each installment of Jackson's LoTR trilogy and of the Hobbit trilogy thus far, The Desolation of Smaug included, has been a glorious romp through one of my favorite fantasy worlds.

Jackson's versions are certainly not word for word, or scene for scene, representative of the novels, but rather than imagining Tolkien rolling over in his grave at the omission of Tom Bombadil, or of the addition of fantastically athletic elves and unorthodox flirtations between the races--- instead imagine the wonder in Tolkien's eyes at the spectacle of modern cinema! This man undoubtedly wrote his novels by hand, or on a manual typewriter at best, and didn't live to see even the cartoon adaptations of his Middle Earth stories. Imagine going from that to then seeing your world realized on the silver screen with Jackson's gorgeous movie magic, and the talents of so many great actors and artists. I am certain Tolkien would feel that Jackson has done this series justice.

My singular regret with these films is that I always have to buy the version as it is first released, and the extended version some months later, because I just *have* to see the film again now, and then just *have* to see those few minutes of extended material, too.

Disclaimer - I am not an owner of this item. I'm holding out for the Extended Edition. I did, however, watch it at the theater...so I'm not making a bunch of garbage up. :)

I enjoyed this movie. I really did. But, it was lacking something the others had. It was lacking heart. It was lacking depth. It was about as EPIC as Die Hard, enjoyable, but not a lot of substance. I left the theater thinking, ""That was a decent popcorn flick"". The problem is, The Hobbit, and subsequently The Lord of the Rings, are NOT light novels. The first four movies have an epic and at times sinister feel to them, yet it never lost the sense of wonder and achievement the book(s) had. The first Hobbit movie did an excellent job of making The Hobbit feel tied into The Lord of the Rings, something Tolkien thought of later (in his rewrite of Riddles in the Dark). Desolation of Smaug was set up to follow that lead. So where did Jackson go wrong? In trying to make a trilogy, I think, Jackson messed up with this movie. The book is just way too short for three 2.5 hour movies. He stretched Desolation of Smaug way too far for the amount of material he included. He also seemed to cut scenes short to make for bigger action ones later, minimizing the role of various characters, in particular, the titular character.

Cons - The movie feels stretched beyond its capacity. There are more action scenes than need be. The addition of a romance between Kili and Tauriel with Legolas playing the poor second male lead isn't necessary. Bilbo's role, about whom the story IS, has been diminished and downplayed. Azog...ok, I get it, we kept him alive to get a better antagonist for the movie...A dragon wasn't big enough?! The ending of the movie is abrupt and unsatisfying. It should have actually ENDED with the Desolation of Smaug...it doesn't. It inexplicably ends with him flying off to demolish Lake Town. It needed the extra 10 minutes of a battle between Smaug and Lake Town. There is plenty of material left after the demise of Smaug to continue for the third movie.

Pros - The addition of Tauriel. She was added to give the story much needed diversity, and it is a welcome addition. The love story between Tauriel and Kili...but wait, didn't I trash talk that? I did...because the triangle is stupid. But, it's bittersweet to watch Kili and Tauriel knowing the fate that awaits them. Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug. That voice needs no justification. However, the real shining star in the movie is Thorin Oakenshield...again. Peter Jackson's Thorin Oakenshield is a much more likeable character than Tolkien's. That doesn't change. He's even more brooding and powerful. Watching him succumb to gold fever is both fascinating and depressing. No mistakes there.

Summary...Stretched to breaking point, Desolation of Smaug manages to go too far, while simultaneously not going far enough. Fans of the movies will still enjoy it. Fans of the books will have mixed emotions, both liking and hating it, while feeling somewhat betrayed by Jackson's adaption.",1395619200,16,3279,4.755711775043936
4636176,3,B0059XTU3G,"...but when you take a relatively short children's book and try to stretch it into three 2+ hour feature length movies in order to garner as much $$$ as possible, things are bound to get a little off. Enter Peter Jackson, King of ""Personal Interpretation"" of one of the most beloved literary tales of all time.

My gripes with this latest installment of the ""Hobbit"" movies is about the same as it was with his blunders in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. He takes liberties where he has no business (ie, completely changing the personalities and mentalities of the characters), and in the name of producing movies that must be at least 2 hours long, he adds in filler scenes that have no business existing at all. He throws in characters who don't belong, actions sequences that make no sense, and will take one chapter of a book and stretch into an hour-long scene that never happened in the original story.

As passionately as I adore Tolkien's works, I'm not a rigid purist, expecting the films to be word-for-word from the books and never include even a goblet on screen that isn't mentioned in the text. But Jackson goes too far... way too far... to the point where my husband and I (both huge fans of the books) are looking at each other all through the ""Desolation of Smaug"" and saying ""Really? You have got to be kidding me!""

*Spoiler alert*

I mean, elves leaping on the HEADS of the dwarves as they float down the river, performing acrobatics so ridiculous, they're laughable? A horde of orcs tossed in for some action sequences that don't even exist in the book? An elf-dwarf romantic tension that is so grossly out of place, I felt dirty just watching it? Elves do not flirt with dwarves, or vice versa! These two races DESPISE each other. Yes, you have moments of reverent respect, such as Gimli complimenting Galadriel, or Legolas befriending Gimli, but this middle-school-ish eyelash-batting stuff... oh, gag me. JRR, I apologize... the somersaults you must be turning in your grave.

Yeah, there's more, like the whole family drama with Bard and his kids (what?) and then guards coming to arrest him for absolutely no reason (""the king can arrest whoever he likes!"" GREAT way to dodge the non-logic of the scene)... and oh, so much more. I was seriously disappointed that the barrel escape from the Woodland Elves - one of the most famous and loved scenes in the whole book - was totally botched! I was looking forward to seeing Bilbo clinging clumsily to his barrel while the dwarves were bounced and trounced unseen in their CLOSED (who dumps barrels without lids?) barrels, until they arrive at Laketown. Alas, 'twas not to be so. Sigh.

Granted, Peter Jackson does a beautiful job of telling the story when he actually sticks to the story, instead of wandering off into his own fanciful alternative universe of FAIL. At this point, I know it's a lost cause, I know the final installment will have more of the same; nonsensical romances, action scenes that don't belong, and moments that strive to be comic relief but come across as nothing but hokey.

4636178,5,B0059XTU3G,"Allow me begin with this preface: I loved ""The Hobbit"" as written by Tolkien and I was admittedly skeptical (and disappointed) when I discovered that this was going to be told in a trilogy. However, I was more than satisfied that Jackson was going to include pieces of missing storyline from various other Tolkien books that Tolkien himself used to fill-in missing portions of the entire saga. And let's be honest, the story needed gaps to be filled-in.

Some complained of the pacing of ""An Unexpected Journey,"" but I personally felt the dwarf culture (whose previous sole rep was Gimli) needed some development. So, I have to side with Jackson on his choice of style in retelling the mournful state of dwarf culture since it was underrepresented in LOR. He was thorough in this without over-doing it.

And now, some are complaining about the over-actioned pace of ""Desolation of Smaug."" To a degree, I will certainly agree. During the river scene, I swear, one more drawn out, impossible trick-shot-combo by Legolas would have elicited a face-palm. Enough. I get it. The elves are the ultra-pimpish jocks of Middle Earth. WE. GET. THE. POINT, Peter. This was thankfully the only painful stretch of the film for me. Generally, I'd say there was significantly more action in this film than ""An Unexpected Journey,"" but the river scene was the only one that was ridiculously stretched out.

Of note: there was quite the variance between the book and the film version of the dialogue between Smaug and Bilbo as well as the entire escape/chase sequence inside the Erebor caverns. I only mention this because some purists may not favor it, but I liked what was added in the film. It didn't hurt to have an actual, direct confrontation between dwarves and their chief tormentor, Smaug.

Without giving away too terribly much, Jackson continues on the path of filling-in missing spaces that were in Tolkien's original ""Hobbit."" Anyone who has not read the Appendixes to LOR, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Book of Lost Tales, etc, will have been left in the dark as to issues such as Gandalf's varied disappearances, the expanded role of the Wood Elves of Mirkwood, the knowledge of Saruman as to the growing strength of Sauron -- to name just a few. Personally, I'm thankful that Jackson loved Tolkien's writings enough to be this well-informed in his efforts to give a thorough telling of the build-up to the LOR.

But, that's just my take. Some hated this film, but I just felt that one important ""tweak"" (Peter, tone the infallible elf ""noise"" down just a tad) was needed.",1395446400,3,2575,4.86986301369863

Well there is one more problem. There isn't any memorable music from the soundtrack. Usually in a middle earth film the music is one of the best parts. This one didn't have it.

I happen to love that about it, as it adds to the suspense and I get absorbed into the characters.  Normally I don't like violence, I think because it tends to be gory, but the violence in these movies don't bother me at all.  I love the humorous lines they throw in every once in awhile, it really helps to keep it light and enjoyable.  There was 1 fight scene where the entire theater laughed out loud, it was so funny!  I actually love the Hobbit movies more than LOTR movies as it's a bit less ominous and bleak, but you still have all the action, adventure, and humor, maybe more so.  For me, it's kind of like how the movies Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins differ from the books significantly, but they're still really good on their own and have become classics.  I would deem these Hobbit and LOTR movies classics if it was up to me.  I think the plot is well-done on its own, and at the same time you want to read the books because the movie didn't give away the plot in the book, so both are worth your time.  After watching this in the theater I immediately watched the Hobbit part 1 when I got home and then started in on the book and finished it next day.  I really got my Hobbit fix!  I can't wait to be able to watch this again.

In my personal view, Jackson et al have done a remarkable job with all the Lord of the Rings movies thus far.  Their love for that imaginary environment comes across brilliantly, and The Desolation of Smaug is no exception.

I wish the purists weren't so negative and inflexible in their reviews.  Tolkien said himself there was no ""canon"".  If one spends any time with his writings, it can be easily discovered that the world and culture Tolkien creates is so massive, he himself could not keep track of many things.  He changed his mind and wrote and rewrote bits and pieces so often that the best one can say is that even the two (4) books he personally published are ""moving targets"".

Desolation of Smaug captures the cultures and environment Tolkien dreamed of SO well.  It integrates things going on in the wider world, providing a truly legitimate context for the journey.

4636196,1,B0059XTU3G,"I have to say I was disappointed (this has nothing to do with the book, just the film). As others have pointed out,  the plot for the film is now battling orcs, fighting orcs, beheading orcs (and if I see one more orc head chopped off, I will really scream--one is good for shock value, but five or six in one scene gets a little old), being chased by orcs, or being injured by orcs (the whole Kili wounding is absurd since a Morgul blade is evil and poisonous because of it's magical properties--no ordinary orc would have one).

Frankly, this series should have been two movies at the most. Instead it's been lengthened by using battle scenes (pretty much all of it). And those in and of themselves get tedious. All of the interesting sides of the story--as others have pointed out here--are just not there, which I see as very weak script writing.

At the end of this second installment, before I even left the theatre, I was wondering if I even want to see the third installment. Everything that was worthwhile in the original story has either been written out or replaced with as much graphic violence as possible. There is actually very little story left to make a third film. Or is another romance or series of violent scenes going to take its place?",1394928000,28,1257,4.504385964912281

4636199,3,B0059XTU3G,"Ok first let me get this off my chest.  This movie is NOT The Hobbit.  There, I feel better already.  That said, it is not a BAD film, but neither is it the timeless classic that a true movie based on the book COULD be.

The first problem is that Peter Jackson is a very literal movie director.  There is NOTHING subtle or suggestive in his directing - unlike Tolkien's writing, which is known for having rich depth, back-stories, and nuanced characters.  Heck, in the Lord of the Rings film, Jackson opens up with the first 15 minutes explaining the entire history of the rings, Sauron, and Middle Earth - a literal ""history lesson"" that Tolkien took 1000 pages to slowly reveal.  This movie is no different.  The story is both dumbed down, by removing important characters or situations, and then dumbed up, by adding over-the-top action sequences that become so gratuitous that after two plus hours of the same stuff they fail to provide any excitement or joy.  How could they make Smaug, an ancient red dragon, look pitiful and weak?  Simple - after having him chase dwarves and a hobbit around a dwarven city for over 40 minutes without causing the slightest injury to any of them.  More on this later...

Why does Jackson feel the need to change the story so much?  My biggest complaints:
(1)  The continuation of the stupid ""orc chasing Thorin"" over-story.  The orc character was stupid from the beginning, and to have him continue to chase dwarves all over Mirkwood, the Wood Elf City, the City on the Lake, etc, is beyond ridiculous.  Gee I wonder if this is going to come to a final conclusion in the last film, with a showdown between Thorin and the Orc?  Duh.
(2)  The reduction of the role of Beorn - an awesome character in the book who was minimized in the film.  In the book Beorn is seen again and plays a vital role at the end.  Will he play the same role in Jackson's film?  I doubt it.
(3)  The reduction of the time in Mirkwood - which did not begin to feel ""mirky"".  Jackson has a problem portraying darkness in his films; the entire section of the first Hobbit movie where Bilbo was lost in the goblin caves was supposed to be in almost complete darkness.  Riddles in the Dark felt shallow and artificial because the actors had to pretend that it was dark - and that they couldn't see other even though there was bright lighting.  In the book the Hobbit the character of Gollum is never even physically described because he is always in utter blackness.  Instead, in this film it was brighter in the caves than in Bilbo's Living Room.  Jackson has the same problem with Mirkwood, where in the book the lack of light caused substantial problems.  In the movie it is as bright as a Spring Day - and not at all intimidating.
(4)  Use of the ring.  Jackson takes huge liberties with when and how Bilbo uses the ring.  In the book Bilbo NEVER takes the ring off anywhere near the presence of Smaug (because it would have been instant death to do so) and yet Jackson has him chatting with Smaug in plain sight like Smaug is some domesticated pet.  There are many other instances where Jackson decides to change how the ring is used - for no apparent reason.
(5)  Stand by the Grey Stone when the Thrush Knocks.  This is a critical part of the story in the book - the entire reason why the dwarves are rushing to get to the Lonely Mountain within a certain timeframe.  Jackson changes how the dwarves find the secret back door.  Why?  The Last Light of Durin's Day - IS AND WAS the sunset.  Jackson changes it into Moonlight?  WHY?
(6)  Bard the Bowman.  This character is changed completely - and is no longer a bowman but a smuggler?  Who knows how to use a special dwarven windlass?  That is fired from the highest tower of the city hall?  That needs a special black bolt?  WHY?  Once again Jackson both dumbs down the story - then adds unnecessary complexity to it.
(7)  The battle with Smaug.  There IS no battle with Smaug in the book.  In fact, the dwarves never even SEE Smaug in the book. So to go from the dwarves never seeing Swaug to them having a running battle for over 40 minutes with Smaug in the city is ridiculous.  Supposedly Smaug, who can melt metal with his breath, entire destroy armies, and devour two complete cities cannot injure or kill a tiny band of dwarves running around.  It cheapens him as an evil, indestructible enemy.
(8)  Elf/dwarf love?  I hated this part.  I didn't mind the elvish female character, but I HATED the fact that Jackson felt the need to create a love triangle with her and Fili and Legolas.  WORSE - the fact that Fili and a number of dwarves stay behind in the City on the Lake and are not with Thorin in the City under the Mountain.  WHY?  Now Jackson will have to find some artificial way to join them BACK UP with Thorin for the 3rd movie?  Or maybe not?
(9)  The sequences with Gandalf were interesting because they touched on what Gandalf MIGHT have been doing while the dwarves were in Mirkwood.  However the stupid orc character (who has no point - and yet Jackson continues to stick him in every scene) ruined this for me.  The dangers Gandalf was dealing with at the time of the book were a LOT more insidious and threatening than the stupid orc.  Additionally there is a section in this film where Gandalf goes to ""inspect"" a special jail for the leader of the RingWraiths.  What????  Once again ""literal"" Jackson strikes - reducing an evil vengeful spirit into some dude you can keep locked up behind iron bars(?)  What?
(10)  Barrel ride.  I enjoyed the action sequence, but it was completely gratuitous, did not make ANY sense within the context of the story, and felt so artificially inserted that it reduced my overall ""suspension of disbelief"".

Bottom line - why change a story that is already a classic?  Why intentionally replace plot elements - with something that is actually WORSE than the original?  The movie felt like someone was vomiting CG money at the screen - without ever asking ""does this make the movie BETTER""?  In my opinion, 95% of what Jackson changed was changed for the worse.

Sadly, I now know that he HAS to carry some of these elements into the 3rd movie - so I already know parts of the story that will be changed and corrupted.  Once again, it will not be for the good of the overall experience.

Note to Jackson - darkness is good.  Sublety is good.  We aren't all stupid, need to be hit over the head with plot elements, and need action sequences every 5 minutes.

I would have been really upset, but then I thought about this movie as ""inspired by"" the Hobbit - like a High School Play - and it made me feel better!  So if you are looking for The Hobbit, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a bunch of CG action sequences with orcs and dragons and dwarves running around and bumping into each other... they certainly spent a lot of money on it!",1394841600,108,6865,4.451405622489959
4636200,4,B0059XTU3G,"I didn't love An Unexpected Journey and didn't have high hopes for this one. Yes, Peter Jackson has done spectacular things. Yes, LOTR was a phenomenon. I just thought that the hype was greater than the results for the first movie in the trilogy. Still, I had to give it a shot and I am really glad I did. This movie was breathtaking. From start to finish I was riveted. The music, the action, the plot, the acting and the backdrops had me absolutely spellbound. If the first one of the series was Andy Serkis' and Martin Freeman's movie, this one belonged to Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman. Superb acting by all, but particularly these two. I was transported to Middle Earth.

If there was one flaw, it was the odd choice for the interspecies romance between Tauriel and Kili. That part dragged, but thankfully it wasn't a huge part of the story.

Looking forward to the last installment.",1394841600,3,894,4.616352201257862
4636201,4,B0059XTU3G,"PJ has not made a film version of the charming and beloved children's tale that so many of us grew up with. Instead, he has chosen to create a full-blown LOTR prequel that incorporates much Tolkien canon that wouldn't have worked in the children's story. In order to enjoy these films, you have to accept that and take them on their own terms. And their own terms are not bad.

The main drawback - orcses, orcses, orcses. Some amount of chase is exciting and necessary and great fun to watch. Despite some clever stunts, the quantity of orc chase/fight in TDOS is way too much - to the point that the excitement wears off and it becomes boring. Every time the story hits a slow spot, PJ throws in a couple dozen scary-looking but incompetent orcs who are handily defeated with the assistance of a couple of elves (Legolas and newcomer Tauriel - yay!). Minus one star for those tiresome orcs.

The only other real disappointment was the toning down of Bilbo's role in the story. I was so hoping to see Martin Freeman sing Tomnoddy and Attercop, and finally earn the dwarve's respect by leading them to defeat the spiders. Alas, not to be. Still, Bilbo did a great job with the barrels and other things.

There were lots of implausible events (this is a fantasy, after all); the one that I disliked most was Thorin leaving 1/3 of the dwarves behind in Lake Town. It doesn't fit the story and it doesn't fit Thorin's character, even though one dwarf was wounded. Thorin is tough and focused, but he is all about loyalty. He risks everything for his followers, and he demands the same of them. It just felt wrong. The chase with Smaug was also somewhat implausible, though I thoroughly approve of the dwarves having a plan to slay  the dragon. I always felt that having Bard turn up deus ex machina to kill the dragon without the dwarves doing anything was a weak spot in the book.

The good: Ian McKellan is as perfect as ever as Gandalf the Grey, and the dwarves are very good and have begun to display their distinct personalities, Thranduil is superb (making up for those perfect one-dimensional high elves who dominate the franchise). Tauriel, who I thought I would dislike, is very good. I didn't mind the love triangle, and I look forward to some Romeo-and-Juliette dynamics between dwarves and elves in the next film. Steven Fry as the Master of Laketown also deserves mention. He does a great job of playing a moment when the Master's inclination to punish the dwarves fights with his greed and his dislike for his rival. You can see the calculator working in his head. Laketown itself is nicely done, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a little racial diversity there.

The best: Bilbo and Smaug. If there was one thing that PJ needed to get right it was that scene, and he nailed it. Martin Freeman plays Bilbo to delightful perfection throughout. The Middle-Earth visuals were, as always, beautiful and perfect. I love the woodland realm, and I think that creating underground worlds with open 3-dimensional structures is a great way of conveying a sense of space while avoiding a lot of tedious cave-and-tunnel shots.

My verdict: Go if you love the world PJ created for LOTR and are craving more - but don't expect the same quality. Go if you like a good fantasy/adventure movie, but be aware that this film ends with a number of cliff-hangers. If, OTOH, you want your young ones to experience little Bilbo traveling and having experiences both pleasant and uncomfortable (and sometimes not drawing-room fashion at all, at all), stay home and read them the book. I went to the movie, I'll buy it, I'll recommend it to others, and I'm definitely going to see the third installment.",1394755200,13,3693,4.654907975460123

3. The tone is darker, and we get more Lord of the Rings-y: BOYENS: ""It's quite a huge chunk of storytelling.

5. Bofur kicks some ass: BOYENS: ""Bofur (James Nesbitt) comes more into his own in the third film. And I can't say much more without going into spoilers for film three, but it's primarily because we needed him to be there when the dragon attacks.""

9. Gandalf's in trouble: IAN MCKELLEN: ""There was a mocked-up doll of Gandalf that Cate [Blanchett] was carrying -- she obviously couldn't carry me -- and we decided to call it Michael Gambon."" The actor teases some dark times in store for everyone's favourite wizard.

4636205,5,B0059XTU3G,"I have read absolutely everything that JRR Tolkien has ever written, and consider myself a Tolkien fanatic. This is my perspective on The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Please stick with me to the end, and I'll try not to lose you. Let's begin. So...if The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was Peter Jackson giving the purists their dues with a relatively straightforward and book-faithful film, then THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is Peter Jackson saying: ""You've had your fun. Now stand back and watch what I can do.""

And the ride he takes us on is absolutely exhilarating. SMAUG is darker, moodier, and more mature than any Middle Earth film we've seen thus far. Evil hangs over our heroes like a black pall (literally). Beset on all sides by revenge-seeking orcs, wargs, terrifying spiders, pale creepy-crawlies, double-crossing elves, treacherous humans, a growing Evil in a ruined Elvish citadel, and a huge, vain, fire-breathing dragon...both the heroes and the audience are plunged into a terrifyingly new world. And there's a lot of new stuff to feast your eyes on along the way.

The Terrible. Smaug just so happens to be the greatest dragon ever! He is everything I wanted him to be and more: vain, seductive, manipulative, terrifying, and of course, absolutely huge. I'd just like to congratulate Cumberbatch and the conceptual crew on his tremendous design.

Our returning cast is also fantastic.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Armitage/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Armitage</a>'s Thorin Oakenshield is electrifying, with gravitas and stage presence enough for a character twice his stature. His grave eyes and deep voice tell of a lifetime of war and sorrow, and every line he speaks could be delivered by a king. Martin Freeman continues to be perfect as Bilbo, and Ian McKellen's Gandalf is just as crusty and warm as you remember him. Oh, and Legolas? Legolas is awesome. Like, web-swinging, spider-slaying, arrow-shooting, orc-killing awesome!

Speaking of orc-killing, The Desolation of Smaug has, in THIS Tolkienian's perspective, the best action scene of the year: the barrels. The breathless, crazy, confusing, insane three-way-battle sequence (don't tease me for it) had me LITERALLY crying with sheer unadulterated glee! The rest of the action, including a hard-hitting spider attack, and a sprawling, rather one-sided battle between 10 dwarves, a hobbit, and a dragon shows that Jackson has absolutely outdone himself!

Well, now for the cons. If Desolation of Smaug has a con, it's that it really, really wants to keep moving to newer, darker territories, so whenever it slows down it feels, well...like an intermission between set-pieces. And the ending will divide the audience: you'll either love the breathless cliffhanger, or hate that you have to wait another year to find out what happens! And as a Tolkien purist, I have to address the fact of accuracy. SMAUG really isn't that accurate to the books. But you know what - I actually like that! I enjoy having absolutely NO IDEA what Peter Jackson has cooked up next. God knows what he's got cooked up for Part Three!

So in conclusion, The Desolation of Smaug is a terrific ride. Filled with amazing action, excellent performances, and the requisite gorgeous New Zealand landscape shots and Howard Shore score, SMAUG is everything I hoped for and more. My rating? Five Kings Under the Mountain - an absolute must-see! I hope you've enjoyed my (completely subjective) perspective on the film. Drop a line in the comments to tell me what you thought.

4636207,4,B0059XTU3G,"Short review: Loved it! Go watch it.

Long review: The Hobbit  The Desolation of Smaug was infinitely better than its predecessor (The Hobbit  The Unexpected Journey) and it wasn't only because Legolas was in it. In this second movie of the three-part series, the risks are more real (the dwarves are imprisoned, and its clear that Gandalf, aka deus ex machina, isn't coming to their rescue), time is running out (if they don't find the secret door on that one particular day, they will never find it again), death is much more imminent (you just try fighting a dragon instead of an orc, and youll see that death is much more likely in the former than in the latter case.)

Better yet, the characters continue to grow. Bilbo, who came across as a bit of a prick in the first movie, is much more likeable in The Desolation of Smaug as he displays his courage and ingenuity time and time again. His willingness to use his brains instead of just his muscles (which admittedly, he does not have all that much of) makes him a refreshing change from the overabundance of warriors (dwarven, elven, human, and orc.) Thorin, the dwarven prince, displays an increasingly dark edge with his ruthless focus on reclaiming his kingdom.

Best of all, Legolas is back. Visually, the elves with their apparently weightless, athletic grace are the eighth wonder of the world. Legolas, younger in this movie than in the Lord of the Rings series, has a subtly rougher edge; hes more impulsive, less serene. He has yet to attain his flawless fighting style. If you recall, in The Return of the King, Legolas takes out several warriors and brings down an oliphant with nary a silky strand of hair out of place. In The Desolation of Smaug, a younger Legolas is in the fight for his life against a host of orcs and (OMG!) suffers a nosebleed. (My husband leaned over and whispered, Oh, the poor baby! which sent me into a fit of giggles.) The look of disbelief and disgust on Legolass face as he wipes his nose is priceless.

The fight scenes were rather drawn out, but Id take a fight scene over a dwarven drinking scene any day of the week. Besides, the fight scenes were varied enoughorcs, dwarves, humans, elves, and the occasional dragon

Of course, any movie with a dragon rocks. Smaug is gorgeous with a sinuous grace that belies its massive size. The awesome cinematography itself is worth the (ever-increasing) price of entry to the movie theaters. In other words, an absolutely outstanding movie.",1394496000,9,2482,4.691954022988506
4636208,5,B0059XTU3G,"I like that we get the theatrical version first and then the Extended version at Christmas time. It gives the studio to add in the scenes that they took out while cutting the theatrical version for theatrical viewing. It also gives them more time to work on the documentaries for the extended cut. So I'm happy with both versions. Remember if you don't have time to watch the extended cut you do have the theatrical cut to see.

Hi, I've been seeing too much complaining on getting ripped off again by Tolkien's Fans or Lord of the Rings-The Hobbit Fans. I will explain to you all that in the business of making DVD's is very tough planning and getting things in order.

One, the studio must produce a DVD from the Theatrical Version and wait until most of the Box Office is run out, in business wise its good. Two people want the DVD in their hands ASAP, and mostly there's a 3 to 4 month wait for the film to come out on DVD. They are trying to please the fans with an original work or documentaries to view on your DVD player. Or do you want to wait for an whole entire year for them to come out with the Expanded Edition and Theatrical Edition all at once.

Two, the producers of the film is still at work for the last HOBBIT film for a Christmas 2014 release. So they must take their time to make that and plus work on the documentaries for the expanded or extended version for DVD release.

So please give them room to work on what they want you to see in full detail. Yes I would like the Expanded/Extended version in my hand today, but I want to wait for a mastered copy that will please me in the long run.",1394409600,8,1615,4.216828478964401
4636209,3,B0059XTU3G,"I want to make only one point that bothered me very much.  Some of the time line is really screwed up from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I was very confused about Bilbao's finding the ring in a riverside pool in the countryside as first show in the trilogy because in the Hobbit he finds the ring when golem drops said ring in a cave while he is spying on Bilbao and the dwarfs who were hiding in the cave from Orcs.

I already had a time line loss of story in the first book when Bilbao leaves his home in the shire to go to Rivendell.  His Journal was just being written and yet in the Hobbit he begins the journal in a different way than was written in the Lord of the Rings.  I know the book says the entire trip to the mount by Frodo and Sam to toss the ring into the fires of the mountain took about 13 months.to complete from the time Bilbao went to Rivendell and Frodo and Sam began their journey and back again.  Yet when Bilbao leaves the Shire to the home of the Elves and much later when Frodo and Sam arrive, Frodo is wounded from a sword stab and the Elves make him well.

Then there is another loss of time line in that part of the film.  Frodo sees Bilbao who tells him his journal is now complete.  He asks Frodo if Frodo still has his old ring.  Asking like he had not seen the ring in years.  Bilbao left the Shire just after midnight when he pulled his disappearing act using the ring to make himself invisible thus exposing his possession of a ring that Gandalf fears is not a good ring to possess.

So back to the dwarfs and Bilbao.  Why would Bilbao, a man of over 115, I forget how old exactly because his leaving the shire occurred after he disappeared at his own fireworks birthday bash, avoiding those horrible Bagginsises.

Okay,  I am a nut for time lines. I also did not care at all for the dwarf's funeral dirge song in the film and sometimes I did not like some of the so-called humor of the characters. The food party at Bilbao's by the dwarf invasion orchestrated by Gandalf.  I would not let those people in my home and of course Bilbao does not know how to keep dwarfs from his home but is good at keeping his relatives away.

And again, this film has a lot of time line inconsistencies in it.

One more point to make. I was told by a kid I met from NZ that Peter Jackson still has about 1 and 1/2 hours of footage for the Lord of the Rings that is not in the released editions of the film.  Basically that means another extended cut.

At 71, I doubt very much that I will live long enough to buy another version.

I get tired of movies that keep releasing extra footage every few years or a 5 to 10 year platinum or gold collectors or Directors cut editions of a film.  First I bought the regular VHS tape of the three films.  Then I bought the extended version of the three boxed VHS tapes (about 13 hours of the story).  Then later I bought the regular DVD wide screened version.  Then I bought the Extended DVD edition with nice maps and index of contents for each film.  A large foldout map of the Shire to the end of the film events noted and all the extras.  Then came the deluxe extended Blu--ray edition and It did not contain the nice well drawn maps of Middle Earth and all the cities and villages and places in Middle Earth that took place in the books and film.  They were in the Deluxe 3 set extended VHS Edition of the film and were to large to insert into the Blu-ray DVD set.  So I lost those three individual maps of Middle Earth that came with the boxed set of the three movies.  So I get some extra video in the Blu-ray but lose the nice larger sized fold-out maps I got in the three boxed set after already buying the individual three movies without all the extras.

Was the same for the Avatar movie. So many versions.  First the VHS edition and then the DVD came out.  I did not see the Theatrical version of the film at the theater. but about 5 months after the film was released, I heard it was a good movie so I bought the theatrical version of the DVD from Amazon.  I was not aware that the film had been rereleased with 8 more minutes in it.  Then James Cameron released a new version in 3D at the Imax in Seattle that had an extra 8 minutes or so in it.  A friend then invited me to see the film and I was blown away not only by the story, but also by the fantastic cgi and the actors who all did a great job in the film. Kudos to Cameron.  So then I bought the extended version with the extra 8 minutes in it.  Then Cameron releases yet another version of the film so I buy the Collector's Extended Cut now with 16 additional minutes in it.  Like Disney, these studios and directors keep re-releasing films, other after the other after the other.  And they definitely milk the customers for all the money they can get.  Thus I am concerned about the Hobbit now.  While I do not like the Hobbit as much as I liked the first Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I doubt very much that I will watch it more than three times yet I did watch the Lord of the Rings Trilogy more than 20 times..

Sorry for the confusion in this review. I had to bark about this messed-up story time line. It makes it really hard to follow the story.

Sequels tend to get irritating like in the Marvel World.  They ,make a good film but constantly change the actors from movie to movie to movie.

I also think the dwarves in general, but especially Thorin, have been given so much more depth and humanity as characters that was greatly missing from the book.

The only annoyance was the ending with a nasty cliffhanger without even a battle won, but everything suspended and waiting to be concluded in the third film.

4636228,4,B0059XTU3G,"They have fought past goblins, trolls and a corrupted forest, but now Bilbo and the dwarves will face their worst enemy: the dragon Smaug.

And despite some big deviations from the Tolkien source material (did we really need a romantic subplot for Kili?), ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a riveting, passionate ride. Lots of action, lots of strong acting all around, and a dragon who is genuinely scary -- not to mention more groundwork for the original ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.

Thorin's company sets out on a perilous quest through Mirkwood, where they encounter the spooky skin-changer Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), Azog's orcs and an infestation of spiders. But the most dangerous is the wood-elves led by the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace), whom Bilbo (Martin Freeman) must free the imprisoned dwarves from.

Even worse, Gandalf isn't with them -- he must investigate the threat coming from Dol Guldur. First he ventures into death-trap graves in the fells, and then into the heart of the old fortress itself.

Meanwhile, the dwarves smuggline themselves into Laketown, with the help of the bowman Bard (Luke Evans). But Bard soon discovers their true mission, and believes that Thorin's (Richard Armitage) quest will rouse the dragon to kill them all. And when Bilbo is sent alone into the mountain, he will find that that may just happen...

If there is one word to describe the second ""Hobbit"" movie, it's ""passionate."" There are many scenes that brim over with powerful emotion -- moments of crushing despair, triumph, and a grinding sense of fear as Bilbo must grapple with a building-sized dragon who clearly is scaring him out of his little hobbit pants.

Jackson also seems happiest when exploring the grander parts of Middle-Earth -- he lingers lovingly on the gold-filled halls of Erebor, the sweeping parts of Mirkwood, and the autumnal beauty of the Elf-king's hall. One of the most spectacular scenes is when Gandalf discovers the true horror in Dol Guldur, a nightmare of fire and shadow that even a wizard cannot hold out against for long.

But there are also some small nice moments, such as Thorin commanding a sick Kili to stay behind, Balin's little talk with the increasingly gutsy Bilbo, or Tauriel talking about the Elves' love of starlight. Little quiet moments in a very loud, action-packed story.

Flaws? It feels top-heavy with wildly over-the-top action (including a very long sequence of orc-killing in Laketown), and the whole subplot about Tauriel and Kili is filler. And corny.

Armitage truly gives a tour-de-force performance in this movie. His smoldering stare and deep voice give a sense of depth and weight to Thorin's quest, and he runs Thorin through despair, anger, sorrow and eventually the commanding strength of a king. Freeman gives a subtler but no less good performance, as Bilbo grows further in courage and strength, which makes his fear before Smaug even more striking.

All the other actors do excellent jobs, and some of them (James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Ken Stott, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner) get some nice development. Orlando Bloom also makes a grand reappearance as a pre-tolerance Legolas, who kicks much butt in typically hyperacrobatic elven style (and shows us why Legolas doesn't usually use a sword).

We also have some new faces: Luke Evans is broodingly noble as the humble bowman Bard, Stephen Fry is grotesque as the Master of Laketown, and Lee Pace plays the regal Elf King with a fierce temper and a core of desperation, elegant and sinuous at all times. Benedict Cumberbatch also does magnificent double-duty -- he briefly voices the Necromancer (which is pretty terrifying itself) and also the rich, seductively vicious voice of Smaug, who slyly messes with Bilbo as he slinks through the golden halls.

Despite being too long and a bit too actiony, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a much more powerful, intense affair than the first ""Hobbit"" movie... but with a multi-cliffhanger. Definitely a must-see.",1393977600,7,4000,5.053110773899848

The only thing I liked about this movie was that Smaug looked and sounded awesome.  He was pretty much the only CGI that I thought was worthwhile in the movie.  I won't go into in-depth detail as to what was wrong with the movie, as other raters who gave it 1 star have captured my feelings already.  While LOTRs had a few silly moments, they were nicely timed to bring a little comic relief to situations and emotions that captured the audience.  But for this movie, I was so detached from the characters that I couldn't have cared less if Smaug burnt them to ashes.  In fact, since Jackson doesn't seem to be following the storyline of the book very closely, he might as well have Smaug turn everyone to ashes and get the ring for himself.

I myself have read the books (several times) and I admit, the films never seem to satisfy or live up to the standards set by the author.  However, people need to realize that will ALWAYS be the case no matter who the director is.  These movies are made for the MASSES, and as such, you have to expect a fair amount of mainstream humor, action scenes, and director's perogative/

I am finding the movies very enjoyable.  The special effects are great, the characters are well developed in their own right (even with the deviation from Tolkien's storyline), and the running times are good (I'm looking forward to the director's cut of TDOS).

I own the Lord of the Rings trilogy set on Blu-ray and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, all the Extended Versions which also come with ten times the more features. Don't be tricked by feeling you NEED to buy this as soon as it comes out. Time goes by fast enough and the Extended Cut to The Desolation of Smaug will be out by Nov just in time for the third installment of The Hobbit.
It's the same trick they did with all three Lord of the Rings films, I was fooled the very first time but never ever again!
Don't rue the day you spent too much money on this series, if there is one director and one film series that is worth waiting for it's the Extended Editions of these films that is Peter Jackson's Middle Earth anthology.
I rented An Unexpected Journey from my local library FOR FREE and I was satisfied to watch it until the Blu-ray Extended Cut came out and THEN I bought it and only then. The basic Theatrical Editions of ANY Peter Jackson movie is just that: BASIC with basic features and NO audio commentary which to me is half the reason to buy these in the first place. I wanted and bought An Unexpected Journey right before Smaug came out and I was fully satisfied... there are plenty of other movies that come out on video during the year don't waste your money on something you know you will be buying again anyway...",1393891200,14,1536,4.355400696864112

4636246,2,B0059XTU3G,"The word that kept coming to mind was ponderous. Everything takes too long. The action, the talking, even the walking. Then there are the diversions from the main story. These are the bits that were alluded to in the book but Jackson has really fleshed them out. Frankly, they didn't add anything to the story  indeed, they detracted from it. When youve got too long to think, you just keep finding problems. Are those Elves or Ninjas? Those Orcs look pretty tough to me, yet somehow everyone kills them like they're ants! Then theres the dwarves  is there anybody who doesnt capture them? After LOTR I thought dwarves were supposed to be awesome? Maybe Gimli was adopted? They talk a good fight but theres a problem there too. In LOTR, the end of the world was truly nigh, so serious speeches were very much the order of the day. The plot here though is closer to an Oceans Eleven caper, so much of the worthy talk just doesnt fit, nor does the unceasing majestic musical score. The dialogue that shouldve been interesting, between Bilbo and Smaug, just went on forever. Indeed, is that how Smaug captured the mountain in the first place  by talking everyone to death? I could go on but then Id just get to the inter-species love story

I wrote for the first film that I thought Jackson wouldve been better doing this in two films only. Seeing this, confirms that thought. Its quite the stuff up. I know Jackson and crew are Tolkien fan-boys but theyve indulged themselves to the point of swamping the central story. Theres no point giving us a heap of bonus material if the audience has stopped paying attention. While it may all have been motivated by the chance to make (another) fortune, will that be the case if no ones watching the third half? (that is a joke by the way) Its my opinion that a lot of people who watched LOTR again and again and purchased the films, won't bother this time round.

I had reservations about this actress, I couldn't take to her in Lost - however, as an Elf, she fits the bill, and she RP'd it brilliantly.

The first one was very enjoyable. He got the songs right and the overall tone perfect. I could accept the slight changes in story and the somewhat poor direction of An Unexpected Journey because it still felt like the trilogy. It was still beautiful in scenery and life impacting in lessons as all of us have come to expect form any Tolkien inspired work.

4636256,2,B0059XTU3G,"Peter Jackson's obsessive fetish for cartoon violence has, if anything, gotten worse since the first movie. Prepare yourself, for the first hour and a half of this film is a tedious and seemingly endless parade of orcs getting stabbed, barely threaded together by the most blandly generic and witlessly executed fantasy dialogue imaginable. The film is weightless, contextless, without tension, without creativity, without narrative flow, paced like a cheap date, tastes like a pixie stick and leaves just as bad a headache. You'll see orcs, elves, orcs, elves, orcs, elves, orcs, elves, orcs, DRAGON, and none but the last leave any kind of impression.

Okay, the dragon. He at least, is magnificent: the most intimidating and beautifully animated and voiced dragon I have ever seen and am likely to see for some time. Better yet, his introductory scene - the entire scene with Bilbo in the treasure room, in fact, even before he meets Smaug - is everything the rest of the film is not. There is tension. There is pacing. There is showing without telling. There is a sense of weight and menace. There is wordplay. There is character development.

Then, Peter Jackson the drooling child shows up again. ""Yay, now I have a dragon to play with too!"" And the rest of the film is the same cartoon violence, only with Smaug taking his sad turn at impotently flailing around and failing to injure, much less kill, any of the 14 heroes over a period of something like half an hour of toothless brawling. How tragic that millions of dollars in talent and technology to give Smaug such a grand entrance is wasted because Jackson insists on constant ""near miss"" action scenes and would not sacrifice one or 2 lousy dwarves out of 13 to give the villain - or any of the other supposed ""dangers"", for that matter - a little presence.",1393545600,13,1821,4.777777777777778

4636259,4,B0059XTU3G,"Before I start, I want you to know that I am a huge lotr fan and love the books and movies, and I love the hobbit book as much or more. Now most of these negative reviews are hollow rants that have no real reason to hate other than it not following the book. THEY ARE DIFFERENT THNGS, AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED SO. All those haters say they loved lotr movies, hey guess what, they followed the books almost as loosely as the hobbit. Now the reason it seems like it doesn't follow as well is because of all the extra stories that pj threw in. Let me explain why he did that. There is a ton of material and stories and histories of middle earth that he wanted to bring to life, but without a big name like the hobbit, no one except hard core tolkienites would be interested. So to bring some necessary and great stories and things from other places in middle earth, he found a way to twist it into one. So really it's not the hobbit, it's ""the hobbit plus silmarillion, plus ties to the Lord of the rings and other cool expansions non tolkienites would never hear about"" but that is a little to long. What are these extras? Well let me list a few: necromancer being sauron, bolg being Azog son, the white jems thanduril wanted, legolas being thanduril son, the morgul arrow in kilis leg(referencing when Frodo got stabbed by morgul blade) and the list goes on and on, many of which will be in the next movie so I won't say. Some other things that wouldn't work from book to movie: closed barrels, really? You would rather see dwarves crammed into barrels and see them float silently and uneventful down the river? ; bard having background and some tension with government,(movie goers love rebels) the master of the town being nasty and... I can't say evil. But right in the book, though brief, it says after all was done and thorin gave gold to laketown, the master and some cronies made off with the loot. He was a bad dude. Ok. So now that I have defended the movie, time to attack. The biggest things I hated: the love triangle, now, I understood why pj brought in a female lead, and if it was just between legolas and her, but thanduril saying no, it would have worked. But no, throw in a gross, unnecessary thing that would never happen.dwarf +elf= dwelf.... just no. Another thing I hated, Bilbo. He is the hero, a clever brave, courageous hobbit who at one point in the drafting of the book, delivered the final blow to smaug. In this movie, and the last he is a foolish, scared dimwit who does some totally random and out of place acts of valour, but still looks like a fool doing them. Why?!?!? Oh well... the last and most horrible things about this movie is freakin beorn. The bear was awesome. Intelligent looking, battle scarred, huge and plain beast and I cannot wait to see him in action in the battle. With that aside, beorn the man...... where do I start. Ok looks. Hideous! The book says he is a BLACK HAIRED AND BEARDED MAN, not some tall skinny greying eyebrow salon. His flat face, nearly beardless face, gross long groomed eyebrows, mane on his back, just blech... next, voice. (Throw up noise) his coarse, whispery Celtic voice is completely wrong. Like another reviewer pointed out, he let the dwarves stay there because of the story Gandalf told him. Not because they beat him in a race to his house. I like how he is uncontrollable as a bear, it makes it more realistic, less like Aslan, well no bad comparison lions are majestic brooders bears aren't. Anyway I liked that but the scene at beorns, while not very important, lasted about two minutes out of like 130. As a key stop and regrouping and rest, you think it would be a little longer. The house is awesome and beautiful ponies, although it didn't mention how all the animals were intelligent and big and awesome. The company spent three days there, not an overnighter. And then the trip from his place to the forest (about 50 miles) took less than 15 seconds. So I enjoyed this movie once I looked over the flaws. It was made for an ""uneducated about hobbit lore"" crowd and looking at it that way, it was an awesome movie. I know that book backwards and I still loved it because I saw it for what it was, a movie.",1393372800,10,4197,4.402831402831403
4636260,5,B0059XTU3G,"I have read absolutely everything that JRR Tolkien has ever written, and consider myself a Tolkien fanatic. This is my perspective on The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Please stick with me to the end, and I'll try not to lose you. Let's begin. So...if The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was Peter Jackson giving the purists their dues with a relatively straightforward and book-faithful film, then THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is Peter Jackson saying: ""You've had your fun. Now stand back and watch what I can do.""

And the ride he takes us on is absolutely exhilarating. SMAUG is darker, moodier, and more mature than any Middle Earth film we've seen thus far. Evil hangs over our heroes like a black pall (literally). Beset on all sides by revenge-seeking orcs, wargs, terrifying spiders, pale creepy-crawlies, double-crossing elves, treacherous humans, a growing Evil in a ruined Elvish citadel, and a huge, vain, fire-breathing dragon...both the heroes and the audience are plunged into a terrifyingly new world. And there's a lot of new stuff to feast your eyes on along the way.

Castwise, Tauriel is a welcome female addition to the gang, played with charisma and spunk by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evangeline-Lilly/dp/B006VZS1EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evangeline Lilly</a>.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lee-Pace/dp/B0094LV94W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lee Pace</a>'s regal and scheming elf-king Thranduil is absolutely astounding, delivering a tour-de-force in a few minutes of screentime.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Luke-Evans/dp/B007H7XRLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Luke Evans</a>&nbsp;could not be better as Bard, simultaneously grim and noble. But of course, the real draw here is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benedict-Cumberbatch/dp/B00499LTLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>, wearing two very villainous hats. The first is as the Necromancer, who, in addition to manifesting himself as an inkblot, is really quite scary. And the second...is the reason that you came here in the first place: Smaug. The Terrible. Smaug just so happens to be the greatest dragon ever! He is everything I wanted him to be and more: vain, seductive, manipulative, terrifying, and of course, absolutely huge. I'd just like to congratulate Cumberbatch and the conceptual crew on his tremendous design.

Our returning cast is also fantastic.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Armitage/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Armitage</a>'s Thorin Oakenshield is electrifying, with gravitas and stage presence enough for a character twice his stature. His grave eyes and deep voice tell of a lifetime of war and sorrow, and every line he speaks could be delivered by a king. Martin Freeman continues to be perfect as Bilbo, and Ian McKellen's Gandalf is just as crusty and warm as you remember him. Oh, and Legolas? Legolas is awesome. Like, web-swinging, spider-slaying, arrow-shooting, orc-killing awesome!

Speaking of orc-killing, The Desolation of Smaug has, in THIS Tolkienian's perspective, the best action scene of the year: the barrels. The breathless, crazy, confusing, insane three-way-battle sequence (don't tease me for it) had me LITERALLY crying with sheer unadulterated glee! The rest of the action, including a hard-hitting spider attack, and a sprawling, rather one-sided battle between 10 dwarves, a hobbit, and a dragon shows that Jackson has absolutely outdone himself!

Well, now for the cons. If Desolation of Smaug has a con, it's that it really, really wants to keep moving to newer, darker territories, so whenever it slows down it feels, well...like an intermission between set-pieces. And the ending will divide the audience: you'll either love the breathless cliffhanger, or hate that you have to wait another year to find out what happens! And as a Tolkien purist, I have to address the fact of accuracy. SMAUG really isn't that accurate to the books. But you know what - I actually like that! I enjoy having absolutely NO IDEA what Peter Jackson has cooked up next. God knows what he's got cooked up for Part Three!

So in conclusion, The Desolation of Smaug is a terrific ride. Filled with amazing action, excellent performances, and the requisite gorgeous New Zealand landscape shots and Howard Shore score, SMAUG is everything I hoped for and more. My rating? Five Kings Under the Mountain - an absolute must-see! I hope you've enjoyed my (completely subjective) perspective on the film. Drop a line in the comments to tell me what you thought.

So about the actual movie, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  There are a couple things I didn't like, the Orcs running around Dale unnoticed, that just seemed wrong imo.  And a couple parts with the Dragon seemed a little Disney-like.  Kind of like in the first movie when their in the Orc cave.  Other than that was pretty good.  I think they portrayed the Elves more as they should, Thranduil doesn't like outsiders.  I still think there is something missing in the Hobbit movies compared to the LOTR movies.  Maybe the characters are being rushed and not developed enough, not sure.  But overall pretty good movies.",1393286400,6,749,4.556390977443609
4636272,4,B0059XTU3G,"They have fought past goblins, trolls and a corrupted forest, but now Bilbo and the dwarves will face their worst enemy: the dragon Smaug.

And despite some big deviations from the Tolkien source material (did we really need a romantic subplot for Kili?), ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a riveting, passionate ride. Lots of action, lots of strong acting all around, and a dragon who is genuinely scary -- not to mention more groundwork for the original ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.

Thorin's company sets out on a perilous quest through Mirkwood, where they encounter the spooky skin-changer Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), Azog's orcs and an infestation of spiders. But the most dangerous is the wood-elves led by the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace), whom Bilbo (Martin Freeman) must free the imprisoned dwarves from.

Even worse, Gandalf isn't with them -- he must investigate the threat coming from Dol Guldur. First he ventures into death-trap graves in the fells, and then into the heart of the old fortress itself.

Meanwhile, the dwarves smuggline themselves into Laketown, with the help of the bowman Bard (Luke Evans). But Bard soon discovers their true mission, and believes that Thorin's (Richard Armitage) quest will rouse the dragon to kill them all. And when Bilbo is sent alone into the mountain, he will find that that may just happen...

If there is one word to describe the second ""Hobbit"" movie, it's ""passionate."" There are many scenes that brim over with powerful emotion -- moments of crushing despair, triumph, and a grinding sense of fear as Bilbo must grapple with a building-sized dragon who clearly is scaring him out of his little hobbit pants.

Jackson also seems happiest when exploring the grander parts of Middle-Earth -- he lingers lovingly on the gold-filled halls of Erebor, the sweeping parts of Mirkwood, and the autumnal beauty of the Elf-king's hall. One of the most spectacular scenes is when Gandalf discovers the true horror in Dol Guldur, a nightmare of fire and shadow that even a wizard cannot hold out against for long.

But there are also some small nice moments, such as Thorin commanding a sick Kili to stay behind, Balin's little talk with the increasingly gutsy Bilbo, or Tauriel talking about the Elves' love of starlight. Little quiet moments in a very loud, action-packed story.

Flaws? It feels top-heavy with wildly over-the-top action (including a very long sequence of orc-killing in Laketown), and the whole subplot about Tauriel and Kili is filler. And corny.

Armitage truly gives a tour-de-force performance in this movie. His smoldering stare and deep voice give a sense of depth and weight to Thorin's quest, and he runs Thorin through despair, anger, sorrow and eventually the commanding strength of a king. Freeman gives a subtler but no less good performance, as Bilbo grows further in courage and strength, which makes his fear before Smaug even more striking.

All the other actors do excellent jobs, and some of them (James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Ken Stott, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner) get some nice development. Orlando Bloom also makes a grand reappearance as a pre-tolerance Legolas, who kicks much butt in typically hyperacrobatic elven style (and shows us why Legolas doesn't usually use a sword).

We also have some new faces: Luke Evans is broodingly noble as the humble bowman Bard, Stephen Fry is grotesque as the Master of Laketown, and Lee Pace plays the regal Elf King with a fierce temper and a core of desperation, elegant and sinuous at all times. Benedict Cumberbatch also does magnificent double-duty -- he briefly voices the Necromancer (which is pretty terrifying itself) and also the rich, seductively vicious voice of Smaug, who slyly messes with Bilbo as he slinks through the golden halls.

Despite being too long and a bit too actiony, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a much more powerful, intense affair than the first ""Hobbit"" movie... but with a multi-cliffhanger. Definitely a must-see.",1393200000,15,4000,5.053110773899848

4636276,5,B0059XTU3G,"First off, I have no trouble admitting this movie is not perfect: I think the editing could have been tighter; I would have preferred a bit more focus on Bilbo's part of the story; and the filmmakers' determination to ignore all laws of physics, (especially in the 'molten gold' sequence), is truly impressive.

So, now that that's out of the way: I ADORED this film!  Flaws and all, I loved it, and after watching three times in theater, found I only loved it more.

Yes, it strays from the book, and embellishes the story left and right; the thing is, those embellishments come from Jackson and co.'s deep love of the material, and their desire to spend just as long in Middle-earth as they possibly can.  They LOVE this world, and it shows.  They want to show us everything, and bring to life details the books only hinted at.  Even when they make choices I wouldn't have made, I'm grateful to them for bringing this world to life so richly.

The cast is uniformly stellar.  Martin Freeman, in particular, IS Bilbo Baggins, and every moment he's onscreen is a joy.  I was one of those who initially doubted Richard Armitage could pull off Thorin, (so much older in the books), but he has won me over completely.  I've really come to love all the dwarves, in fact, and to appreciate them as individual characters, which is frankly something the book never actually managed.  (Special shout-out here for James Nesbitt, who's charm as Bofur never fails to make me grin!)

And then there's Tauriel, played be Evangeline Lilly.  Her character was controversial, but why?  No, Tauriel was not in the book.  But as Tolkien never once said, ""and all of the elves were men,"" and as there wasn't a single named female character in the book at all, Tauriel's presence is both justified and necessary.  [For the record, I saw the similarly controversial ""romance"" between Tauriel and Kili as no romance at all: just a very clearly one-sided puppy love from Kili, and a warm fondness and protective instinct from Tauriel.  Very sweet, and really not over-the-top.]

Much as I loved The Hobbit: AUJ, this one's better.  The pacing is improved, the story-telling is tighter, and the action feels more plot-relevant.  I could easily write on and on about my favorite scenes, and how many great moments have lodged permanently in my memory, but better to let folks watch this for themselves.

I do just want to add, regarding those reviews that gave one star expressly because this is not the extended edition:  Getting two cuts to chose from is a good thing, folks.  No one is forcing anyone to buy the movie twice.  Me, I actually WILL buy both, because I know from experience that when I re-watch these films, I'm sometimes in the mood for the longest possible visit to Middle-earth, (extended edition), and sometimes I just want to cut to the chase (theatrical).  But no one's making me do that, and it's awesome that we do have a choice!",1393113600,515,2928,4.682974559686889
4636277,4,B0059XTU3G,"I gave this item a 4* rating because to me the movie is better than the 1st part and we actually get to see Smaug properly for the first time.  Also the 4* rating is for this particular edition of the movie.  Yes I know that later on there will be the extended edition but this version does not deserve to be down voted just because it is not the extended edition.  The simple thing is if you want the extended edition then rent the movie and then buy it when the extended version is released.
To actually come on the item page and leave a low rating just because the item is not the version that you want is just plain ignorant.
I am buying the stand alone 3D version to watch and the limited edition one to keep sealed.
When the extended edition comes out I hope there will be a limited edition with a statue of Smaug and I will buy the stand alone 3D version and limited edition (if there is one) of the extended edition.
Plain and simple... It's up to the individual what they spend their hard earned money on and maybe there are a few people who feel hard done by that this isn't the extended edition and that they have to wait until around October for the extended version but people knew this would happen and will happen next year for the Blu-ray release of the final part of The Hobbit.

4636278,3,B0059XTU3G,"Haha, wow. A lot of Peter Jackson fans here. Just wanted to add a couple new observations at the bottom of these main comments.

This film was definitely better than An Unexpected Journey. The pacing is much more accomplished and Jackson doesn't linger on and on with certain sequences. I could have imagined him spending a half an hour on the scene with the spiders, but thankfully he restrains himself. Unfortunately, he doesn't show the same restraint in his use of bad comic gags and.his representation of the Dwarves as hapless goofballs for whom luck is as equally responsible for their survival as is skill. The scene I most enjoyed was Gandalf in Dol Guldur. Finally Jackson gives us a peak at what Gandalf is capable of (after diminishing his power throughout the LotR trilogy [the Witch King breaks his staff?? A magic flashlight to drive off the nazgul instead of the fire described in the book??] However, the pristine white magic of Gandalf contending with the evil black of Sauron is entirely too reminiscent of the way magic is represented in Harry Potter, particularly the Prisoner of Azkaban.
All in all, it was a relief to see that the quality had improved and that Jackson had found some restraint.

New: I find it interesting that Jackson chose to include Beorn after so conspicuously cutting Tom Bombadil in LotR. Jackson struggled the cut material from LotR and here he's struggling to add material. I also find it interesting, after listening to the commentary on Unexpected Journey, that Phillipa Boyens and crew tried to talk Peter out of some of the more idiotic comic gags (eg. The stick bug in Radagast's mouth) without success. I get the feeling that Peter gets what Peter wants, and I mean that as an ominous comment on Jackson's directorial style. There's a four-year-old lurking around in Peter's mind (and heart?) as well as a gifted, experienced filmmaker. However, it's not always a felicitous combination. For my money, Jackson has made two great films. Heavenly Creatures, and Fellowship of the Ring, a landmark in cinema history. Unfortunately, when he branches out, the results are ho-hum. I join most reviewers in the general consensus that King Kong and The Lovely Bones are pretty mediocre offerings.",1393027200,3,2242,4.928571428571429

As for the quality of the movie:

1) This is a perfectly enjoyable movie for anyone who hasn't read the book.

It  seems to have caused (from my watching the LOTR series again recently) that I enjoy LOTR more now probubly for that reason.  I can't wait for part 3 where we should hopefully get a great battle between Sauron and the combined forces of Galadriel, Saroman, and Radagast.  Maybe Peter Jackson will even bring in the two blue wizards.....  To sum it up, I can't get enough. Give me 3 + hour extended versions!! I'll take it all.",1392940800,15,776,4.391608391608392
4636294,2,B0059XTU3G,"I liked Beorn (not enough screen time), Smaug looked awesome on screen, and I can live with the barrel scene despite it having some really ridiculous moments - But I had so many issues with this particular middle earth film unlike all before it - Mind you the first Hobbit movie had its own red flags to dampen expectations.  I understand why Tauriel was added with the number of men in the story but her addition felt forced and her 'take no prisoners' aggressiveness made me really dislike her.  The love story in LOTR with Arwen & Aragorn seemed genuine and added to the story but the one with Tauriel and Kili was ridiculous to the point of making one cringe - Seriously, why the instant attraction except 'looks' ?!? - It's stupid and the worst decision made in any Jackson movie so far ie: King Kong, LOTR... you name it.  Great to see Orlando Bloom but his face has visibly aged since LOTR which I can live with.  The Hobbit may be fantasy and less serious in tone to LOTR but there's way too much over the top stuff going on... Even fantasy should obey the laws of physics to some degree.  Without sounding too old fashioned my last and most important beef is the crude references in these Hobbit movies so far such as Bofur's ' have the balls for it' reference to croquet in AUJ and Tauriel's finding 'nothing' comment to Kili about searching down his trousers.  I never find these references funny - In this case I also find it disrespectful to Tolkien who led a clean and respectful life and especially since he wrote the Hobbit as a children's book.  Success might be going to the head of some people unfortunately... At the end of the day these stories are still Tolkien's and I hope that isn't forgotten on anyone especially Jackson and his crew.  I love the book and still feel LOTR are some of the best films made but there's a strong chance I might just skip the Hobbit - Even Howard Shore's score does not meet his usual high standards for this film.

4636299,5,B0059XTU3G,"Coming a year after the underrated and underappreciated The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson strikes again with the years best movie- The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug. After a brief prologue featuring an excellent flashback conversation between Thorin Oakenshield and the wizard Gandalf, the movie hits the ground running and pretty much never looks back. This is a much more action packed movie than its predecessor, featuring an intense giant spider attack sequence in Mirkwood Forest, a thrilling river barrel chase sequence as the dwarves attempt to escape from Elvish captors, an intense battle between Gandalf and Sauron, and a non-stop battle with the Dragon Smaug at the end. As is to be expected, all technical credits are first rate, from the often brilliant special effects, to the stirring Howard Shore musical score, to the excellent use of High Frame Rate 3D. In addition, the film delivers some outstanding acting, with particularly good performances from Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Luke Evans as a well-developed and sympathetic Bard the Bowman. It is also great to see Orlando Blooms Legolas back in action, and despite the initial controversy, the addition of Evangilne Lilly as the female elf warrior Tauriel is a welcome addition, even if she does not appear in the book. The crowning achievement of the movie, however, is the Dragon Smaug (the best dragon ever portrayed on the silver screen) and his initial reveal in the ancient kingdom of Erebor is absolutely perfect. This is followed by an Indiana Jones style climax that ends in a real cliffhanger that might irritate some. For me it just means that the final movie, The Hobbit: There And Back Again will launch with an absolutely incredible action sequence. Like The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers, Desolation does not really have a beginning or an end, but like that brilliant movie, it is definitely one hell of a middle.",1392768000,6,1968,5.058461538461539

4636324,3,B0059XTU3G,"As in the first installment of the Hobbit trilogy, there is plenty to criticize here. It's not the fact that the story has been embellished so much as the fact that Peter Jackson is not much of a story teller. Whenever he can rely on Tolkien for plot and dialogue the film is golden. When he has to make it up on his own things get stupid in a hurry. This is the main reason why by the end of the second film I still didn't feel like I knew the dwarves on this quest, nor did I much care to. Thorin especially comes off as annoying and downright unlikeable--hardly the effect that Jackson was aiming for.

What saves this sequel from following the first film into the abyss of failure are two factors--the scenes involving Smaug turn out to be both interesting and impressively rendered, but more importantly--we finally get to see Gandalf strutting his stuff and against Sauron no less.

The Gandalf of Jackson's LOTR trilogy was rather pedestrian compared to the ancient and powerful being that Tolkien described in the original books. Pick up a copy of The Two Towers and read Tolkien's account of the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog (pp. 490-1). The Gandalf described here was a far more powerful wizard than that portrayed by Jackson in his movies. Tolkien has Gandalf quipping that if any had witnessed this battle, songs would have been sung about it in the ages to follow. And this was a display of his power as Gandalf the GREY! Yet in the Return of the King, Jackson's version of Gandalf the White was less than awe-inspiring.

In The Desolation of Smaug Jackson appears to be making up for past mistakes by unveiling a Gandalf capable of impressive displays of power. The table appears set for Jackson to do something akin to what George Lucas did with his last three Star Wars sequels--start weak, get better, finish strong. If Jackson follows through in the final installment and gives his audience a Gandalf that is analogous to the impressive Yoda of the final Star Wars sequel, he may just be able to salvage this trilogy after all.",1392076800,,2054,4.60655737704918
4636325,4,B0059XTU3G,"I've been reading the series (Hobbit thru ROTC) once every year and a half or so for 25 years and every now and then throwing in the Silmarillion.  I love, repeat LOVE! the books!  Tolkein is an undisputed master of tone in his writing.  But I also understand that print and film are two entirely different mediums and by definition cannot tell a story the same way.  For instance, books let you live inside the head of a character.  It's kind of hard to do that effectively on film.  Film relies on motion and sound as well as the attention span of an audience.  So with those differences in mind, I LOVE the way Peter Jackson is retelling the story.  It has all the elements that drive us to go spend our dollars on a movie already and I believe is true to the SPIRIT of what Tolkein wrote.

The Hobbit is a children's book and therefore has a very different tone than LOTR.  The beginning of the Hobbit is pretty slow and Jackson set the tone of his first movie accordingly but knew that a movie of this type needs a certain type or amount of energy to keep it going.  That's why I was delighted to see the Necromancer concept more fully developed as well as bringing in Galadriel and Saruman. Even though Tolkein really didn't use them in the Hobbit, you gotta know that they are still very important and central characters that are influencing events during the time of the Hobbit and are figuring out that Sauron is alive and well.

TDoS takes the movie-ness of the story to the next level while remaining true to how Tolkein's storyline progresses.  Again, it develops the Necromancer elements which are awesome to see on the big screen as well as giving a great introduction to how cool the elves can be when they are in full fighting form.  Yes, again there are differences in the details of the material but it still goes back to what is a more effective story telling method on the big screen than what is printed on a page yet retaining the important elements that develops the original story as well as the world in which the story takes place.

Jackson is developing a full story arc that encompasses The Hobbit and LOTR and is deliberately crafting the Hobbit trilogy to become the first several hours in one long epic movie that maintains a consistent tone and feel from start to finish despite the first half being a children's book and the the second half being an adult fantasy series.

I think a lot of people forget that most of the ""extra stuff"" was written by Tolkein himself in the many appendices and notes that he had written.  Since those elements are not contained within the normal chapters of the books, they tend to be forgotten about.  I really wish Jackson would delve into how Gandalf recruited Aragorn to protect the Shire while Sauron starts to exert his influence over Middle Earth during the time between The Hobbit and FOTR.  That's in the appendices and establishes Aragorn's interest in the hobbits.  Not to mention it would give Viggo some face time in the first series to tie him in with the rest of the retuning cast.

Also think about the culture of the intended audience.  Tolkein writes in the vein of high literature.  The art of his work is in his written prose.  Jackson's art is in the experience of the movie theater.  I'm not sure it is possible to convey the art of literature in a Regal Cinema though I think Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens have done a remarkable job of bring as much as possible that prose (or kind of prose in their original writing) to the screen.  If the focus was ultimately to be on the art of Tolkein's words brought to a screen then it almost seems like this story would be better served a mini-series on Masterpiece Theater or the BBC.  But that is a very different audience than what Jackson is trying to reach.

Jackson should be judged on his ability as film maker, to bring not just the story but the world that Tolkein created, to life in a medium that is embraced by the movie-going audience.

I think he nailed it.",1391731200,68,4001,4.464924346629986

I have to point out that Howard Shores wonderful soundtrack is a huge driving force for all these movies but with DOS it's almost hypnotic. And Peter Jackson who was born to direct these films hit it out of the ball park again. Not as funny, or innocent or talkie as AUJ, DOS puts the company into many serious situations as they are hunted not only by Azog but by time itself. The emotion that they cast gives when they enter Erobor is one that will bring an tear too your eye. And then there is Martin Freeman who was born top play the young Bilbo; damn how his character has evolved over these two installments. And the fact that he had not received an Oscar nod for his work in this film is a complete injustice!

I saw this at the theater and thought this a sequel that was actually better than the first.

I am not so familiar with the books and from what I understand Jackson adds quite a bit to the trilogy than what was written in the books. I am not going to be as critical of that as what book to movie adaptation follows the book very closely. I can understand the criticisms of the fans of the book as it always seems that movies change things from the books but for recreating a truly fascinating fantasy world, this movie does a great job. So from that perspective of being movie entertainment, I am less critical.

The sequel feels more in line with the LOTR's as some familiar characters from that series make their return.. An Unexpected Journey was to me a bit too slow at times to develop the story and almost felt as though it was being stretched out to fill a trilogy. DOS is anything but slow. The sequel has a great story, lots of action and adventure and brings back some of the great characters from the LOTR's. What else could you ask for?? The special effects are great as with all the movies, the scenery is beautiful and well done and the movie is worth watching especially if you are a fan of the series. Peter Jackson has taken this great story from the book and expanded and made it a great series and this sequel is definitely entertaining and worth watching.

4636330,4,B0059XTU3G,"Given the crap that is most of the movies released these days, a sure-fire good movie is the ""Desolation of Smaug"". Purists will of course note deviations from the original text, but in terms of enjoyment, this is a definite winner. Before viewing I was a little skeptical of the inclusion of the ""warrior princess"" new character, but she was quite enjoyable, not some sort of ""I am woman"" overload.
The only minor criticism relates to the borderline silly scene where Legolas and others perform improbable acrobatic feats as they slay orcs along the river. Can we ever cure these directors (or more likely, the tasteless financial backers) of pandering to the eleven year old audience members? A movie this good will sell to all audiences, and it debases the product to include such contrived ""kiddie scenes"".

**One last thing: I didn't like the 3D version at the theater (I had no choice due to schedule). For me it added nothing, and the slight disorientation it gave me was a detraction. Maybe it works for younger people, but my $0.02 worth is that 3D is more fad than value added. By the way, be sure to buy the Blu-Ray version when available. I think Jackson shot all the film directly in digital, so it really looks sharp in HD.",1390262400,3,1237,4.648401826484018

4636356,5,B0059XTU3G,"Let's get this out of the way first.  This movie, and overall trilogy, is not a carbon copy of the book.  If you are hoping for, wanting or expecting a film which gives a spot on treatment of Tolkien's masterpiece...or anything close to a spot on treatment...look elsewhere because this is not it and you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a really awesome and spectacular movie trilogy ""BASED"" on Tolkien's masterpiece, then you are in for a treat!!

So the first installment of this trilogy was very good.  But, although it pains me to admit it, I was less than impressed with parts of it.  And certain parts just seemed ruined for me (Goblintown being the main one) and I really wanted Jackson to have done better with his treatment of them.  Nonetheless, I give the first movie 5 stars because it is epic.

But this movie...The Desolation of Smaug....was Spectacular!!!  Definitely better than the first one and would give 10 stars if possible!  The action was great and the movie never seemed to drag on like the first one did.  I very much enjoyed the barrel scene and the action sequences in Erebor during the Smaug fight.  Also, I really liked the introduction of Tauriel and her interaction with both Legolas and Kili.  Very interesting twist in my opinion.  The cheeseball-ness that was Goblintown in the first movie was mostly absent from this movie other than maybe Radagast's sled...that was a bit over the top yet excusable for sure.  And some could argue that acrobatics of Legolas and Tauriel during the barrel scene was over the top.  But I kinda liked that part and thought it fitting since Tolkien elves are supposed to be so graceful and light of foot.

Overall, this movie is superb and well worth the cost of a movie ticket.  In fact, I would call it the best movie of the year although I am biased for sure as an extreme Tolkien fan.  I will definitely be purchasing the HD digital version of this on Amazon the first day it comes out and will consider that one of my best purchases of the year.

4636358,3,B0059XTU3G,"This was probably a pretty good fantasy action movie, but the problem is it's supposed to be a movie of Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit"".  If you're going to make a movie based on one of the most popular novels of our century, maybe you should try to make it like the book, eh?  I mean, I don't mind some of the additions - particularly the development of stuff hinted at and referred to in the book (e.g. Gandalf's mission to check out the Necromancer, Radagast - heck, I don't even mind the non-book female elf character).  But, if you're going to make a 9-hr. movie about a 250-page classic book, why not throw the fans a bone every now and then and include the scenes Tolkien wrote?  Pretty much every scene has been reimagined by Jackson & co., so don't expect to see any of your favorite book scenes come to life.  Also, Jackson is a little too infatuated with bad action movie clich&eacute;s (e.g. - character in a very urgent situation stops and stares at something or looks taken aback for several minutes, army of enemies or giant monster seems completely incapable of harming unprotected protagonist in plain view, etc.) which kind of detract from the movie whether you're a fan of the book or not.  Also, while the actual scenes from the book are rushed through, the new scenes are drawn out a little much, and there seems to be so many convoluted side plots and unnecessary plot complications it kind of messes up the forward motion.  It seems Jackson has fallen exactly into the kind of trap one would expect by trying to make a short book into a long movie series.
  On the bright side, the movie is pretty visually well done - the scenery and creatures are all pretty good, as we've seen in the Lord of the Rings movies.  (Although, again, I must complain - what's up with the dwarves?  They're supposed to be pretty bulky and full-bearded like Gimli in the LOTR, these actors are much to thin and some of them barely have any facial hair - Jackson dropped the ball on this).
  While I largely enjoyed Jackson's LOTR movies, I get the impression he really didn't like the book The Hobbit and probably shouldn't've done this film.  (Maybe if they'd gotten Chris Columbus?  The feel of the first two Harry Potter films would've been more in line with the Hobbit book).
  In short, this is probably an enjoyable enough action film for those who like the kind of thing Hollywood pumps out, but maybe Jackson should've just written his own story and not based it upon a very popular book if he didn't want to make a movie like the book!",1389744000,8,2543,4.493478260869566
4636359,5,B0059XTU3G,"Great movie; of course they could not fit everything in from the book... there is just too much information.  Jackson and his writers did a fabulous job in keeping this film family friendly, and extremely entertaining while keeping the essence of the story in tact.  I am sure there will be the first release, then an extended release with appendices (I hope) as was the case with Lord of the Rings.  However, seeing as Jackson choose to shoot this film in HFR and in 3D, that is the only way to go when you purchase the Blu Ray.  I will wait until that 3D HFR option becomes available before purchasing.  Jackson and his team of hundreds did a great job.  I have high hopes this series will be the greatest film collection up to this point.  It's going to be hard to beat.",1389657600,3,773,4.363636363636363
4636360,1,B0059XTU3G,"What happens when a director who turned the 1008 pages of the Lord of the Rings into a trilogy of Middle Earth motion picture epics attempts to give the same treatment to the 330 pages of the Hobbit?

The answer is the Desolation of Smaug: a 3 hour long action commercial for the coming wave of Hobbit toy merchandise and video games, apparently aimed squarely at tweens and ADHD sufferers.

What we have here is approximately 2 hours of the padding that was required to transform the Hobbit into a trilogy of movies. In the process of generating the padding, the director introduces new story arcs and characters that contribute absolutely no tension or momentum to the story whatsoever.

This is probably because they proceed to spend most of their time engaged in nonsensical, long-running action fight/chase sequences which string together arrays of physically impossible feats and events in a manner that would make Michael Bay blush.

So it's not just about the departures from the original story, the surplus of orcs, or Jackson's failure to capture the whimsical charm and ambience of Tolkien's work - it's about this movie being an extended CGI chase scene interspersed with plodding dialogue between irrelevant characters. It literally feels, and plays like, a Playstation game.

It's hard picking out the dumbest moment, but we definitely have a contender in the shape of Radagast on his bunny powered sled, as he strives to become the Jar Jar Binks of this franchise.

Apparently this needs spelling out: sleds are used on ice, snow, and other smooth surfaces that offer minimal resistance and few obstacles. Sleds are eminently unsuited for travelling around summer forests with their vines, boulders, bushes, and, you know, trees. Radagast and his bunny sleigh are not cute, they're not rustic, they're not creative. They're stupid.

The best thing I could say about this ordeal is that I somehow managed to stay awake until the end, and that was thanks largely to the appearance of Smaug towards the end of the movie, which managed to instill some dignity back into the narrative. But I won't say that because Smaug's behaviour in his scenes suggested that he was infected by the same brand of nonsensical silliness that permeates the rest of the movie.

No, the only reason I stayed awake through to the end of the movie was because I had a supply of chocolate covered raisins to keep me awake.",1389657600,51,2410,4.9041769041769046
4636361,3,B0059XTU3G,"The Desolation of Smaug was one of the few movies I was excited to see last year, so much that I even went to see it opening day; something I haven't done since Return of the King if memory serves. Unfortunately, it's clear this movie would've been largely absent had The Hobbit remained two films, and this left me wondering if the originally proposed duology will some day be released as well. I was actually fine with many of the adaptations in An Unexpected Journey, and of course understand that those changes had to continue to the next installment. However, when watching this movie two things happened that didn't in the four prior Peter Jackson directed movies based on Tolkien stories; I felt the need to check my watch, multiple times, and I had little desire to pay to see it in the theater a second time. SPOILERS to follow!!

My main criticism for DoS is that most of it is filler, and largely unnecessary filler at that. The pacing, tone, and score of this movie also seemed off to me. The entire movie felt rushed, except for the fight scenes ironically. Large-scale battle scenes are hard to do well, but PJ has done some excellent ones in the past, so to say that many of those scenes in here were downright boring and implausible, even for Middle Earth, still surprises me. In regards to the tone, there was practically no humorous moments, and even if you haven't read the book, the characters' invulnerability from the first movie is more than enough to surmise who is in any real danger out of all the pseudo-suspense. I also don't recall hearing any of the title music from the first movie. There were several times Frodo's theme from the LotR was played, as well as a great deal of 'suspenseful' music, but nothing from AUJ.

I think it's great that Gandalf's side-plot to Dol Goldur was included in these movies, but much of it strains logic and contradicts the LotR movies, despite the heavy-handed way they are being tied together. For one thing Middle Earth is a big place, whether you're on horseback or a fast-moving bunny sleigh. There's simply no way Gandalf would have the time to go to the catacombs, then to Dol Goldur, get captured while inexplicably entering the fortress alone instead of waiting for the White Council to help, and be to Erebor in time for the battle of the five armies. Secondly, Galdalf getting captured by Sauron and surving with one of the elven rings of power is a bit too contrived. Finally, although a cool scene, ""the nine"" are called wraiths for a reason; they never really died and have no humanly remains to bury.

I had no problem with the addition of Legolas into this story. His father is the king of the Woodland realm. He lives there so his presence is understandable. Tauriel is a different story altogether. PJ creating an entirely new female character in a story that is both male dominant and already has too many characters we know very little about isn't the issue, at least not for me. I'm willing to bet that the concept of her character was much more palatable when The Hobbit was a duology, and Evangeline Lilly is definitely easy on the eyes, but making a new character work requires giving her something to do that a) adds to the overall story/plot and b) separates her from the other characters. To these ends, Tauriel as a character misses the mark because her addition actually diverts from the overall story/plot, with that whole love triangle nonsense, and she's basically a lady-Legolas with healing powers similar to those of Elrond's.

The infamous chase scene at the end of the movie deserves a mention, because it was downright laughable. Running around inside Erebor trying to kill Smaug using ancient equipment without sustaining any casualties is just not feasible, though seeing dwarf technology in action was pretty neat. Thorin's ride on a wheel barrow top along a river of molten gold and thinking a giant gold statue would even hurt Smaug were also improbable. At the end Smaug decides to leave the dwarves and Bilbo to go after Lake Town, but there was no real connection to the people there in this movie, at least from Smaug's perspective. In the book Smaug couldn't get to the dwarves because they were hiding in that secret passage, but it was quite evident they were helped by the people in Esgaroth. Bilbo is starting to use the ring quite a bit more, and at appropriate situations no less, but for some reason he takes it off at times that make absolutely no sense.

There are a great deal of questionable deviations from the source material to mention, but in trying to rate the movie on its own merits I'll leave those for my fellow reviewers. Despite all this, the Desolation of Smaug is certainly not a total loss, as it did succeed on the entertainment side, which is of course the whole point of movies. The visuals continue to be stunning throughout most of the film, aside from some of the fight/chase scenes, but Smaug was so well done, both visually and the voicing by Benedict Cumberbatch, that it makes up for some of the less than admirable points. Due to these, and many more reasons, I would still recommend watching DoS, especially if you enjoyed the first. I would recommend; however, to wait to purchase this movie until the extended edition is released during the holiday season this year.",1389398400,,5316,4.669156883671292
4636362,4,B0059XTU3G,"Director Peter Jackson (King King, Lord of the Rings) did a little better the second time around with J.R.R. Tolkiens book, however there are scenes in this production that just absolutely drag on forever it seems like. There are other scenes that are quite action packed and filled with adventure and style. I definitely felt it was better than the first film, but it still lacked the consistent flow that a good film should have. The Hobbit - The Desolation of Smaug does follow the book fairly well, however with extremely exaggerated scenes in most cases. Let me highlight some of the things worth noting.

Martin Freeman (Sherlock, Hot Fuzz) does an amazing job at giving Bilbo Baggins a realism about himself. His performance is honest and quite passionate but his hesitance and personal amazement at his accomplishments as a character in this film, shows there is a lot of growth happening here. Martin is an amazing actor and I believe quite under rated for his work here.

It was wonderful to see Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Three Musketeers) back as Legolos the elf with attitude and gymnastic like bow and arrow skills. He is sharper and innocent than compared to the original Lord of the Rings trilogy and as such plays his character with conviction of truth and righteousness.

Another nice surprise was Evangeline Lilly (Real Steel, The Hurt Locker) as the elf Tauriel who, like Orlando is skilled, sharp and witty both with words and actions. It was fun watching the character develop as the Hobbits trenched through their lands and she set the tone with her actions and convictions.

Always an honor and with tounge-n-cheek flair, Sir Ian McKellen (X-Men, Lord of the Rings) as Gandalf the Grey is simply a charmer to watch. Leading the Hobbits and ferociously teaching Bilbo, his subtly as a performer is a pure delightto watch. This role suits Ian like a warm comfortable glove.

A special note to Richard Armitage (Captain America, Strike Back) for playing Thorin the dwarf with a heavy history and weight on his shoulders destined to take back his land from a very evil and overpowering dragon. Richard is very interesting to watch as his character basically leads the company, however everything he does is so well thought out and extremely filled with conviction that you cant help but feeling his grief.

Radagast is back and Sylvester McCoy (Doctor Who, The Academy) has his same wit and humor about himself but this time with a passion for life and the love of the forest and animals and great concern for Gandalf. I just loved watching Sylvester and his antics and innocence.

There are a couple of action and fight scenes both with Spiders, Orks and the Elves all involved several sequences that are fast and exciting and often humorous in their execution.  Now kudos to Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into Darkness, Sherlock) has an amazing resonance and as the voice of the impending Dragon, Smaug, he is quite scary and threatening to everyone who sees him. Martin and Benedict, as Bilbo and Smaug,  have some great banter toward the end of the film and its done so well in terms of the cadence and tempo of their dialogue, I just wonder how they pulled it off.

Overall The Hobbit - The Desolation of Smaug is a fun and interesting film but this one is not so much worthy of the Imax or 3D, but as Jackson has pulled it off before, the third one may be the best yet. Lets hope. Good for the family, but not as fulfilling  as  other current films like Disneys Frozen or Gravity for me.",1389312000,2,3534,4.7191558441558445
4636363,5,B0059XTU3G,"If you enjoy the combat of those who fight against dragons, this is a good movie to watch. The dragon, Smaug, looks like a cross between a bat and a carnivorous dinosaur. It has giant spike-like claws, and breathes fire. It speaks, and taunts his prospective victims. It takes the wealth of the people, and fully intends to keep it. It is destructive of lives and property.

The Hobbit comes face-to-face with the dragon, and the action really starts....",1389225600,3,454,4.746835443037975
4636364,4,B0059XTU3G,"I have never been a member of the church of J.R.R. Tolkien; having read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I would gladly place Tolkien in the company of Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Robert Louis Stevenson as a master storyteller, even if his style has not always aged well over the decades.  When it comes to fantasy, George R. R. Martin and his GAME OF THRONES is much more to my liking.

But I am a true movie buff and I would place Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS movie trilogy in the ranks of cinema's true epic works of the imagination, right up there with 2001 and STAR WARS.  And when it comes to Jackson's adaptation of The Hobbit, a rather slender children's book, I think the Tolkein fanatics just need to give it a rest. The movie version of any literary work should be seen as an alternate version of the original; in other words, the same characters doing somewhat different things.  That was the way Stephen King described the CBS television version of UNDER THE DOME, and I think it is a good description of THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.

Because in the end, SMAUG makes for a pretty good fantasy movie with more than a few great set piece action scenes as Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin and the rest of the dwarfs journey to The Lonely Mountain and a confrontation with the great dragon Smaug.  Along the way they meet up with a familiar face (a least to viewers of LOTR), Legolas the elf archer, still played by Orlando Bloom, and run afoul of Lee Pace's Thandril, an elf king.  And that is after a very nasty run in with the spiders in Mirkwood forest.  The Orcs are still on the dwarf's trail and there is an exciting battle as they escape in barrels down a raging river with the monstrous Orcs giving chase on the banks.  There is a stopover in Lake-town, where we meet Luke Evans's Bard, and the town's scheming master, played by Stehpen Fry under a lot of makeup.  The finale, if it can be called that, concerns Bilbo's attempt to sneak into the chamber under the mountain and steal the Arkinstone out from under Smaug's nose.  This is the high point of the movie, thanks in no small part to some great CGI and Benedict Cumberbatch's vocal contribution as Smaug himself.

There are plenty of faults with with THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG: it can be really talky at times, even after AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY got the introductions and exposition out of the way; the pacing is uneven due to the demands of stretching a children's book into a three part epic; Evangeline Lilly's elf ears are too large; it is impossible to keep track of all the dwarfs except for Thorin the leader; even for those who don't have a problem with a lot of CGI, there is a lot of it; at one point, Thorin turns on Bilbo, negating the moving final scene of AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY; and a really abrupt ending that left people in the theater wondering for a moment what had happened.

Still, Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job of creating a fantasy world that lives and breathes, filled with characters whose back story would make an epic movie all on their own.  It's great to see McKellen back in one of his iconic roles (the other is Magneto), even if he's not on the screen enough.  Martin Freeman is more than up to the job as Bilbo, one of film's central characters, the other being Richard Armitage's Thorin.  I do miss Christopher Lee's Sauroman and Cate Blanchett is onscreen for only a moment as Galadriel.

And if I'm partial to Martin and GAME OF THRONES, I'll be more than willing to admit that none of it would have been possible without Tolkien, the Hobbit and the Rings, along with all those rabid fans who have fallen in love his work down through the years.  Just take it down a notch when it comes to the movie.",1389225600,6,3718,4.434654919236417
4636365,3,B0059XTU3G,"First, I just want to say that I hate to give this three stars. I love the whole LOTR/Hobbit movie franchise, and would like to say that all installments were very carefully and well done as would make Tolkien himself proud. But, unfortunately, this movie doesn't seem like it had as much passion put into making it as the previous Hobbit installment did. Though, that doesn't mean that its an entirely bad movie.
For me, there were several problems with the characters: Bilbo seemed to have only a few lines thorought the whole movie, and he's, like, one of the main characters. Most of the time he's just moving along with the general flow of the story and says hardly anything at all. This is a pretty bad problem which really took my notice. Another problem was the way Legolas was portrayed. I was really exited to see him and what his role would be in this movie after I first saw the trailer. But I must say, that I'm a little disappointed; the character himself is really great, but his look isn't. he looks older and more heavyweight than he did in LOTR. And that shouldn't be so, since he should be 60 years younger in this one than he was in the LOTR series. Sure, Orlando Bloom (the actor of Legolas) has gotten older since he played in LOTR, but I'm sure they could have hid his aging body looks with computers. Also, his eyes look really weird; and, unless the directors have a really genius idea to explain this in the next part, looks like a very weak computer point in the movie. There isn't as much ""fun"" watching the dwarfs as they go on through there journey; things just feel a little bit rushed with them. An always-on-the-move sort of feel. This is a problem that wasn't in the last part; it was easy to connect to them and feel along with them in the previous part. Not as much here, though.
And let's not forget Tauriel. She isn't bad as a character; I think that she is very well developed in her personality and so on. But I don't think that she belongs in a Tolkien story. She doesn't feel very Middle Earth-y, if you know what I mean. She acts like a tomboy, slicing and dicing, killing any orc, goblin, or any other grotesque creature of evil that manages to cross her path. Not even Azog was so bloodthirsty. Somehow, she just seemed a little out of place in the cast for this movie.
I also wish Beorn length of appearance could have been prolonged. When I read the original book, I really enjoyed reading about the dwarf's stay at his house, and several of the memorable moments that happened there, like when Gandalf tells their story to Beorn by introducing more and more dwarfs (that part is one of my personal favorites). But Beorn's appearance is limited to one rather short scene. There isn't allot of time given to develop and use his character in the movie. He just appears and then leaves, just like that. I really wish that they could have made more time to give this character more of a role in the movie.
Also, I don't like the whole ""love"" thing between Kili and Tauriel. Seriously. It really is obvious that the producers of this movie just wanted their to be a love angle. I though the whole love line in LOTR as excellent and actually added to its flow. But not here. It's rather awkward, and just plain weird. If they wanted a good romance in The Hobbit, have it between and elf and an elf, not an elf and a dwarf. It looks like Legolas likes Tauriel. Why couldn't the ""romantic"" scenes be between them?
Also, there is one remark made by Kili which just needs attention. He makes perhaps a rather inappropriate remark as they [the dwarfs] are being taken to the Woof Elf's prison. This had me, like ""Were the darn heck did that come from!?"". There wasn't any bad language in the books; the books being pure is one of their characteristics that make them such masterpieces. But they've just spoiled that here. It was totally unrequired and totally stupid.
Well, despite all this, the movie wasn't completely disappointing: the filmography perhaps outdoes that of the previous part, and the Dwarf Mountain were Smaug lives is just spectacular. I found the exchange between Bilbo and Smaug to probably be the best sequence in the whole movie. I really like how they enlarged the role of Bard; he does a very important thing in the next movie (which I'm sure will happen, as it was one of the key characteristics in the original book), and that means that his character needs good development. In the book, he only appears, like, two pages before he...well, I don't want to give away a spoiler as to what he's going to do in the next part. I think that it was a good choice by the directors in enlarge his role in this part. All of the humorous parts are funny and well done, but don't take away anything from the main plot. I found the ""gags"" to be sometimes hilarious and very enjoyable. Not too much like something that you'd expect from the book.
So, overall, the filming and battle sequences are as good as ever, living up to the filming standards of LOTR. The characters (except for Tauriel) are as memorable and connectable as ever.  But some of the content and dialogue really don't live up to the standards of a die-hard Tolkien fantasy movie, like what we saw in LOTR. Even though, as a movie, its perhaps a masterpiece, it's a disappointment as a movie on a Tolkien fantasy. They could have done better. I just know it.",1389225600,9,5375,4.467955239064089
4636366,4,B0059XTU3G,"You might have heard of a little book titled The Hobbit.  I've been reading it to my kids lately, so the book is fresh in my mind, and the second installment of Peter Jackson's trilogy is a good reminder that 1) The Hobbit is actually about a hobbit, and 2) the ""Desolation of Smaug"" is not about hobbits.

So what is the ""Desolation of Smaug"" about? Legolas.

Now that's not being entirely fair.  It's about dwarves fighting giant spiders, an elf/dwarf romance, and a egotistical maniac who just happens to be a dragon.

There's a lengthy scene in first installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" in which we see Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) as his jocular, pipe-smoking self.  This was back when Jackson wanted to film ""The Hobbit"" series but got ""The Lord of the Rings"" instead, and it's clear that he slipped in much of the charm of the early chapters of ""The Hobbit"" into the other movie. So now the parent has become the child, and ""The Hobbit"" is fully in service to ""The Lord of the Rings."" At every turn we're reminded that this is not about Bilbo (Martin Freeman), but about the coming of Sauron.  In essence, this is the Middle-Earth equivalent of George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels, with one critical difference: they're rollicking fun.

While ""An  Unexpected Journey"" was off to a slow start, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" starts off running and then breaks into a sprint. Moments that were leisurely in the book are cranked up to 11 in the film; dwarves don't just show up in pairs at werebear Beorn's (Mikael Persbrandt) house, they run there when the skinchanger rampages around in his massive bear form; Gandalf doesn't just investigate the Necromancer, he has a battle royale with the dark lord himself; and the dwarves don't just bump along in sealed barrels down the river to escape, it's a wild water ride filled with elves, orcs, and dwarves in the middle. And Legolas (Orlando Bloom) kicking ass.

Remember that scene when Legolas did that crazy move atop the Mumak in ""Lord of the Rings?"" A good half of ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is that over and over -- Legolas at his most awesome, potentially to impress his love interest and hot elf chick Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly, who is part elf anyway) who easily keeps up with him. And  yet she's torn by her growing affection for the relatively tall (for a dwarf) Kili (Aidan Turner).  None of this is in the books of course -- not Legolas, not Tauriel, and not the relationship -- but it provides some interesting dynamics in the interplay between dwarves and elves.

Eventually some of the dwarves and Bilbo make it to Smaug's lair, and he's every bit impressive as we imagined, embodied by Benedict Cumberbatch's silky snarl. The conflict between he and Bilbo is greatly expanded and goes beyond a mere cup; indeed, Smaug is both more vicious and calculating than his book version, constructing an escalating series of grudges against his real and imagined enemies.

But you know what?  It works. Reading The Hobbit reveals Tolkien's genius in how it delights children -- my kids are still laughing at the talking troll purse -- and watching the film reveals Jackson's genius in keeping adults entertained for two hours.  No one will confuse the two and that's okay.",1389052800,6,3231,4.712255772646537
4636367,3,B0059XTU3G,The Desolation of Smaug is the 2nd film in a trilogy and the follow up to the first HOBBIT movie.,1388880000,3,97,3.9
4636368,5,B0059XTU3G,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an excellent, fast paced, action packed film that was absolutely fabulous eye candy in IMAX 3D; and yet Peter Jackson still takes time to deliver excellent character development and back story, which was well appreciated by this viewer even if some of the story line is original to Jackson's movie.  This installment is also more reminiscent of Jackson's LOTR trilogy with the welcome return of the elves as a major part of the story line.  I can highly recommend the second film to anyone who appreciates Jackson's deferential approach to Tolkien.  However after reading perhaps the hundredth review from fellow readers who still appear not to have noticed, I feel compelled also to point out that all movies based on books are highly abridged versions of the original literary work.  The old adage ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" should be instantly apparent as the reason for this difference before the opening credits are finished rolling.  As vastly different art forms books and movies are by necessity presented in a way that will best connect with their particular audience; so why incessantly complain that there are differences between them?  In the Desolation of Smaug the art of effective movie making is once again aptly illustrated by Jackson and underscored by Philipa's skillful transformation of the book into a screen play that can still do J.R.R. Tolkien's vision justice.  And when a few frames of a movie can chew through twenty or more pages of a book, deviations from the original source material are to be expected in order to maintain pacing and give certain characters enough dialogue to cast leading actors of the caliber required for such an epic film.  Not to mention that some readers protests seem oddly out of place in reference to the Desolation of Smaug when the first installment, An Unexpected Journey, was as widely criticized for being too slow paced.  The second part of the trilogy is anything but plodding.  The extended versions are often the best compromise the movies can offer to the book.  I for one can hardly wait for the Bluray, 3D extended version of The Desolation of Smaug to be delivered to my door (while equally glad that I am not required to sit for six hours to watch the complete movie version of The Hobbit--unless I want to at home!)",1388880000,308,2338,4.849246231155779
4636369,5,B0059XTU3G,"I LOVED it!  Just came from the theater and saw it in 3D.  In some movies, the 3D doesn't seem to make much of a difference.  Here, it was blended very well, and felt very natural and effective.  Notice even the opening scene where the rain was coming down heavily.  You felt like you were standing in it.

As you probably remember, the first Hobbit was a gathering of the characters along with background info.  It ended with a shot of all the gold inside the mountain and the sleeping dragon within the piles of gold.  The second Hobbit picks up with the dwarves continuing on their quest to the mountain and the perils they face in their travels.

I found the approximate 2 1/2 hour film to be intense, edge-of-your-seat entertainment.  Of course, it was full of action/fighting, magic, elves, dwarves, orcs, and the dragon.  I thought it was much better than the first Hobbit, but again, the first Hobbit had to set the stage.

It ain't finished yet, and there will obviously be a third part.  I can't wait to see it and I will certainly be buying this DVD when it becomes available.

Note that I did not read the book, so I am basing my review on the merits of the movie alone.  I believe a movie should stand on it's own anyway.",1388880000,10,1234,4.3744493392070485

Can't please everybody, so why try? I found the second installment a wild romp. And the Jackson-invented Tauriel was quite different from what I had initially envisioned. Now I find myself looking forward to the final installment mainly for the inevitable epic battle scene. The ones in the LOTR trilogy were nothing short of SPECTACULAR, so I'm certain that the upcoming film is no different.

4636383,2,B0059XTU3G,"Slow, yet with manic action scenes that do nothing to move the story forward and with enough padding to fill a cubic football field of matresses, The Hobbit is one of the most boring movies I've ever had to sit through. Endless action and cliffhangers within cliffhangers, both Peter Jackson cliches, do not make a good movie, especially if the action is only present for its own sake.  And because the action is so cartoony, it becomes goofy. Any sense of menace or tension it might otherwise have had is destroyed by its sheer implausibility and over the top maniacal quality. In fact there is so much action that it becomes tiresome because very little of it has anything to do with the story and it all looks so fake being mostly CGI.

Unfortunately the story is changed, and not to the better. Things that were important or interesting in the book are glossed over. Beorn for example is barely present, and Mirkwood seems an afterthought. Even Smaug was a letdown because he displayed little of the unearthly menace of the character in the book. A few interesting back stories from LOTRs appendices are included such as Dol Guldor and the necromancer. But they are rewritten and not faithful to the source material. Things are changed unnecessarily in other words. Peter Jackson also sees fit to add some ridiclous subplot with female action elf Tauriel (PJ's invention) and her flirtation with the dwarf Kili. WTF?!? Not to mention the orcs-chasing- the-characters action subplot in which Legolas gets to kill a bunch of badies. Problem is that Legolas wasn't in the Hobbit book.

Bilbo however was, and the movie is called The Hobbit because Bilbo is ostensibly the main character.  Yet Bilbo is barely involved in this chapter. Very little of his courage, pluck or growth of his character are at all evident. He's reduced to a comparitively minor role in the movie that bears his name! Yet Jackson makes Bard and the Master of Laketown into major characters, padding the movie with fairly unimportant Laketown sequences, complete with Orc battle (?!) into ridiculous lengths.

So much is changed that Tolkien's original story is nearly unrecognizable in this mess. The only similarities between the Hobbit and this movie are some plot points (there is a dragon, some dwarves, a hobbit and elves) and some character names. None of Tolkien's intent remains. Which could be forgivable if the movie were at all interesting, its just not. Run from the Orcs, run from the Elves, run from the Dragon, rinse, repeat. All of the plot editions Jackson and company added are unsubtle and cliche hackwork as though they were written while consulting a scriptwriting for dummies book. Why in hell was a 300 page book padded out into three, two hour long movies? Oh right, money.

I give it two stars for art direction but this movie just sucks.",1388534400,32,2839,4.8312757201646095
4636384,5,B0059XTU3G,"When a novel is written and has a vision that will blow you away the one thing many artists want to do is make a movie about it. Nine times out of 10 movies that were firstly books suck. What people have to understand is that Jackson has devoted nearly 15 years of his life to this universe we know as Middle Earth. What people also have to understand is that every reader can see something different. Having said that Jackson has stayed true to this world Tolkien created. Sure he has added a lot, but he really hasn't taken out anything major, if he did these films would not span six films because viewers would simple give up. Critics whether they are ""professionals"" or ""fans"" have to understand their vision probably won't entirely make the cut of the film, if it did it wouldn't be Jackson's vision. Having said all this The Desolation of Smaug is a grand adventure that is well acted, directed, and told without confusion. And thus far is the best Middle Earth picture to hit the big screen!

Some notes and opinions as well as some tips for those who haven't read the book or saw the previous film. *Minor Spoilers*

The spider sequence is very realistic but shouldn't be frightening to children, many in my audience seemed to enjoy the action and seemed amazed by the realism.

Scenes where Bilbo uses the ring were not over used or seemed boring, in fact Jackson created a nice look for the way we see his view of things, it also is a major plot point.

Martin Freeman continues to outshine Elijah Wood as the star of this second trilogy of the awesome world of Tolkien.

Gollum is not in the film, for a reason. I would suggest reading the novel.

The scene involving Smaug and Bilbo is pretty intense but again younger audiences shouldn't get scared as Jackson keeps it family friendly enough considering Smaug is a Dragon. It is also probably the best sequence in a LOTR/Hobbit film thus far.

Ian McKellen continues to bring better screen presents with age, and shows no sign of slowing down.

The acting by everyone is top notch, the humor is great for families and adults alone.

The action is plentiful and the visuals are stunning.

This one has a better pace then its predecessor (even though I love Unexpected Journey as well)

Every scene has a purpose, there is no eye candy only shots.

While it clocks in at nearly 3 hours counting previews, I never once wanted to leave.

I saw this film in 2D so I cannot yet comment on its the 3D effects, should I view it in 3D I will add that to my review.

Last but not least, the film is an epic adventure that maintains the adventure of the novel yet adds to the excitement.",1388534400,7,2640,4.438923395445134
4636385,5,B0059XTU3G,"The people who are saying that Jackson is destroying the story of The Hobbit with his new trilogy are the purists who think it should have been 1 movie based on a small children's book. It was the studio that wanted a trilogy instead of the duology that Jackson planned. I found the movie to be much better paced than An Unexpected Journey. The only downside I would say is that you are left with a big cliffhanger at the end. I found that the addition of the movie-only character Tauriel to be good in diversifying the cast as the book was literally all male characters except for one female who was referenced only. Jackson did a great job of expanding the story, history, and characters to make a more enticing film. These films also make a better continuity from the Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings than the actual books do, in my opinion.",1388534400,8,843,4.410256410256411

I do not see why Jackson has to stray so far from the story and add so much that is never in the original story. In my opinion he doesn't need to do any of it to make it a good, enjoyable movie. It appears that he does all this to enhance and give background to his Lord Of The Rings movies, to which he added things not relevant or in the book. In this movie he is trying to build up the necromancer( Sauron), which is only mentioned in one obscure sentence in the Hobbit. He has added a female elf, which I get the impression is meant to add a ""love"" element to her and Legolas. The female elf also seems to be ""taken"" with the dwarf - absurd. There are whole segments of Radagast The Brown, amusing and entertaining but completely invented. The whole segment of looking for the tombs of the Nazgul - invented. One great chapter of the book is about the stay at Beorns home but is briefly shown in the movie. There are so many other things in the movie that are either misrepresented, misleading or entirely invented that I am tempted to give it only a one star rating. If you love the book and go to see the movie, forget the book because the movie pretty much puts it in shambles. Like the LOTR's and Unexpected Journey, The Desolation Of Smaug, is filled with invented stories and plots and completely overdone with too lengthy scenes.",1388448000,10,1511,4.3052631578947365

4636389,3,B0059XTU3G,"I was prepared to expect various contrivances in the action scenes, since Peter Jackson has repeatedly demonstrated that he doesn't care about plausibility in this way, and I also knew that he was going to stray from the source material, and so I was pretty well enjoying the first two hours of the film.  I liked the dark and moody settings, the portrayal of Gandalf, etc.  I started daring to think that the film would be a good one, for persons who are willing to overlook unrealistic combat, questionable physics, and similar contrivances.

But darn it, the silly guy finally did it.  Two minutes after meeting Smaug, the accumulation of ridiculous, inconsistent, and nonsensical events had become so extreme that it was just impossible to swallow.  The filmmakers couldn't make up their minds whether to portray Smaug as intelligent, or a doofus.  They tried playing it both ways, going back and forth between the two until the result was akin to a 3 Stooges chase scene that the filmmakers wanted to claim to be a serious adventure.  The problem is shared by so much contemporary cinema - they want the special effects to be perfect, but they don't bother to make the writing very good at all.

Even going through most of the film with a willing suspension of disbelief, the final 20 minutes or so was so outrageous, so inconsistent, so nonsensical... that it was simply impossible for me to accept.  Someone really needs to edit these films - not for length but to remove all the NONSENSE that Peter Jackson keeps putting in.  I can handle the fact that the story is changed, but darn it, the changes need to at least make some sense!  All reason just got thrown away in the end.  I was willing to trust him and buy a ticket even though he'd messed up previous films with these plausibility-defying excesses.  I have no choice but to try to just pick and choose things that I liked about this film and focus on those, while trying to forget the absurdities that Jackson offered as a ""climax.""

News flash for Peter Jackson: Mere spectacle is not enough to keep an intelligent audience interested.  When ""action"" loses its meaning through horrible contrivances, inconsistencies, nonsense physics, and detachment from meaningful characterization, then those scenes are simply not engaging.

4636402,4,B0059XTU3G,"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.  His cinematic adventure began last year and continues this year.  Peter Jackson's rationale for stretching out Tolkien's book into a trilogy of nearly three-hour movies has been well-documented by this point.  An Unexpected Journey received mostly weak or middling reviews.  However, Jason, Mother, Father, and I all liked it well enough to look forward to the next movie.  That glimpse of Smaug's eye while he wakes up and peeks out of the pile of coins certainly teased something intense.  A couple of weeks ago, my friend Jason and I went to see it in a theater that is a fair distance away; I only now got around to reposting my impression here.

Let me get this out of the way first.  Yes, we did attend an HFR-3D screening, which is why we traveled to that theater.  How did it look?  Yes, it did look like a sports broadcast or an old BBC drama.  Yes, the smoother motions did sometimes look exaggerated.  Yes, I did need some time to grow accustomed to it.  When I did, however, I found it to look very nice.  The computer-generated creatures, sets, and effects actually look more natural and better-integrated with the live actors and sets.  The overall picture had a brilliant clarity.  If you get used to the higher framerate, you too might find it beneficial to the overall experience, though its understandable if you dont.

And now for the movie itself.  In terms of plot, the movie cant stand on its own, as it is built to be the middle section of a longer storyand it ends on a blatant cliffhanger to boot!  The overall story has a lot going for it, though.  I must disagree with critics who say that the pacing is lethargic; it never felt that way to me and every scene felt like it was directed appropriately. It gives us some intense interactions among characters along with wild action scenes, even if Legolas sometimes looks like an over-the-top super-ninja and some other small elements are also silly.  The cinematography is lush and creative, which seems to have been a trademark of Jacksons from the beginning of his career.  The actors play their parts well, from Martin Freeman as Bilbo to Ian McKellen as Gandalf to Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug.

I was disappointed that the theater I went to last year on Christmas day did not show the 3D version on that day.  I planned it on it all year. I went to the movies anyhow and watched what they had. This was great! Even without 3D it was great! I read the book a year ago and will probably read it again. I have last year's Hobbit movie on my Kindle HD and the book too. This does not always seem like what I read in the book, but better actually. I really enjoyed the big screen pictures. I could actually see the fabric of their clothes and get an idea about how clothes might have been made in the Renaissance period.  I noticed that Bilbo had doilies and they were crocheted. I kind of laughed at that one, because I know that crochet was invented sometime about the 1850's. The costumes were great! The characters are great! The scenery is fantastic throughout! The only thing I hate is waiting till next year to get the rest!",1388102400,4,1000,4.225130890052356
4636405,3,B0059XTU3G,"Peter Jackson did an extraordinarily good job of adapting Lord of the Rings to the big screen, considering the difficulties involved.  For some reason he simply throws out what he learned when he made The Hobbit movies, so far.  Only the barest frame of the Hobbit book makes it into these movies.  Apparently stretching it out into three long movies required huge amounts of padding.

And yet somehow Jackson still misses the mark.  We have a made-from-scratch character, Tauriel, a she-elf who falls in love with, yes, one of the dwarves.  Of course, she also kicks orc butt effortlessly, thus pleasing the feminists and fantasy fanboys.  At the same time Jackson completely botches the Beorn episode and Beorn himself.  Everything is wrong with his approach here, and there's no reason to see why he did them like he did instead of being more faithful to Tolkien's much better story.  Beorn is either a lunatic bear or an absurd looking human in the movie.  Treasure your concept of this figure in the book, because the movie version is idiotic.

As filler, the movie also includes the start-up of a vast foundry in just a few minutes by the dwarves that's been idle for decades, even as they're under attack by Smaug.  Not even the vast leap of faith magic requires would have made any sense here.  Smaug shows himself to be a little dense and incompetent in the film, whereas in Tolkien's book he was quite astute and only by luck did the dwarves escape incineration.  Bard of Dale is badly misrepresented (again, why?) but the town mayor, played by Stephen Fry, is a hoot.

The battle to clear the Necromancer from Dol Guldur, referred to only in passing in the Hobbit, is fleshed out in the movie but still mishandled by Jackson.  It was great fun to watch, and (minor spoiler here) its resolution will presumably be taken up in the last movie, but it's quite different from what Tolkien wrote.

The movie was great eye candy with lots of action, and certainly more entertaining than the first of this trilogy.  But this is an instance where the divergence between book and movie makes having read the book a distraction.  There's often nothing wrong with a movie differing from its book source, but in this case the book version is always more entertaining and, for a make-believe world, more believable.  Given the luxury that Jackson took in making a one-movie book into three, it's puzzling that he could be so wide of the mark and pump the movies with so much fluff while fumbling basic outlines of the Hobbit.

Maybe there was just too much Smaug in his eyes.  Two and a half stars, rounded up since this film was better than the first.  And shame on those in the audience who had little (and I mean toddlers) kids with them, who squealed with delight at the frequent orc beheadings.",1388102400,28,2796,4.661224489795918
4636406,5,B0059XTU3G,"This movie has caused quite an uproar amongst movie critics, Tolkien fans, Tolkien purists, and regular movie goers alike. There are those who LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and those who just want to see it die, by their own hands. I can't recall the last time I've seen such a polarizing response to a movie before. ""Blade Runner"" comes first to mind.  Although even I admit there are allot of silly and thud hitting moments in this movie, they were all but contradicted, and made up for, by the amazing visuals this movie had.  Not necessarily the visual FX's though. But the ambiance and the cinematography is a sight to behold.  Yet the negative reviewers who have an unbelieveable grudge against this movie, seem to be coming from a hatred for the decision to make The Hobbit into 3 movies..... Which even I was furious at.
  The long winded exposition of ""An Unexpected Journey"" served as a (FALSE) catalyst for them to confirm and proclaim their disdain. But now that PJ has heard these critiques, and took them into consideration, and the pace has been dramatically raised to 11, they can't complain.... So now they are stumbling over themselves as they refuse to not see a movie, but a decision. And as a result are digging out the most minute irrelevant nit picky details to rob this solitary movie of it's deserved fame. The Lord of the Rings is guilty of almost the exact same flaws as this film is.
  The only thing I see as unforgivable about ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is how Bilbo, the main character, is really a supporting role. Which is horrible considering how Martin Freeman is a Grade A actor, giving a Grade a performance, something I felt none of the Hobbits in ""The Lord of The Rings"" quite ever pulled off.
  But if I keep going on the subject of reviews. I might start sounding like a hypocrite, hopefully I haven't already..... It's time to talk about the main thing about this movie ""SMAUG!!!!!!""
  Smaug is the where all the high quality CGI went. He is as photorealistically believeable as Gollum, and the size of Godzilla..... Maybe King Ghidorah would be a better comparison (Especially for the last part.)  It is a shame that all the CGI quality went to him, because there are moments where the rest of the movies CGI is..... BLAH!
  This movie is so thick with atmosphere and for the first time, for me at least, in the Middle Earth film saga, we have a movie that actually looks and feels like a fantasy Epic. And it is now one of the most unique ones ever, with the Greatest Cinematic Dragon ever, after years of The Dragon from ""Dragonslayer"" reigning supreme.
  In short I think everyone needs to see this movie as, Yes indeed part of a trilogy, but a solitary movie in and of itself. That's what trilogies are. A continuing story taking place over 3 ""Separate"" films. Did we need this to be a trilogy NO! But we have it and now need to find the glass half full approach. For me it's the fact we get to see more middle earth now. And I personally thought the book was one of the most random things I've ever read, so the ""FILLER people are bashing, helps relieve the spontaneous esotericism of the original sources episodic plot structure. Plus to be fair, at least the DOL GULDUR sequence was right from the horse's mouth (I.E. Tolkien)  I'm not saying that allot of the negative reviews were not genuine though, but allot of them were very much in the same ""BA HUMBUG"" Vein.  See this movie for yourself if anything see it for Smaug. But the response to this movie has made critics for any artform fully revealing as invalid, because anything that people say about something is subjective.......

And that's my point.  It's eminently forgettable!

With long, tortuous action scenes and disconnected characters (with the rare exception of our heroin, Tauriel), this movie is a jumble of incoherent plot and storyline.  The screenplay is terrible.  The cinematography is marginal.  The action scenes are overly long.  The dragon is ridiculous (you'll know what I mean if you see this film) - and there's barely a character I care about.

My question is simple:  how could the makers of such a great film series (I consider The Lord of The Rings to be the best ever) turn out such a terrible prequel?

The pace breathes a little slower, so we are not desensitized, overwhelmed. The special effects, more realistic, not like a video game, which helped bring down the first film in its suspension of disbelief. The action breathes, not thrown at us one senseless round after another. Most of all the story line breathes, much more adult, much more complex, enabling new & old characters for us to become more acquainted with & involved.

4636409,3,B0059XTU3G,"Spoilers. I'm not one of those blatantly biased people that went into this film with my mind already made up, I enjoyed the first one (7.5/10) and after reading so many positive reviews, I was highly anticipating Desolation. To my surprise I didn't find myself particularly enjoying it too much. The CGI was the biggest flaw in that it was so obviously fake that I wasn't once truly immersed. LOTR a decade ago mixed special and practical effects to the point where you struggled to tell them apart but in DOS, everything pretty much is CGI and I just couldn't get into it. It didn't feel real. I don't know how over the course of a decade special effects seem to have got worse but Desolation of Smaug makes a case for it. The colour palettes were weird too and were reminiscent of a pirate copy on the internet. It almost looked bland.

With 3 films being announced, I wasn't sceptical, I was overjoyed at what I assumed would be a trilogy with a rich story with a range of characters having plenty of time taken to being made 3 dimensional, but DoS was simply a string of set pieces. It replaced story with action. Where action should supplement a story and characters, DoS focused on it almost solely. Look at Fellowship of the Ring; not including the Last Alliance (which did have the story set up by Galadriel prior to it so you cared), we received an abundance of story and character development before the first sword was swung. Fighting is meaningless if you are given little reason to care and so was the case with this film. Sequences such as the barrel ride conflict didn't really elicit any reaction from me at all due to the fact that I had no real reason to care. The CGI was chief among those reasons as it was practically a cartoon. I thought WETA were the pre-eminent effects studio? The choreography was too outlandish to take seriously and there was no threat or danger. No-one dies so there are no stakes. FOTR was a veritable bloodbath by comparison, with Frodo almost dying twice, Gandalf 'dying', Boromir dying, it wasn't a movie where our heroes went unscathed by any means. Every conflict posed a threat as they should.

Five and a half hours in and the majority of the dwarves have not been differentiated, let alone become actual characters. Some still haven't said a word (Bombur) and for this reason it's very hard to like them or care for them. All we need is less than a minute each to say who they are and what they're about, that's it. That's all we need to notice them but they continue to be glorified extras. I recall reading an interview in which the dwarves' actors spoke in depth regarding their characteristics but the films don't show any of that. It's embarrassing how poorly they've been handled.

It's astounding how remarkable the difference is between Jackson's previous Middle-earth films; I know it's wrong to compare them as LOTR is the greatest trilogy ever made and near masterpieces but I'm simply talking in terms of the basics. Like story, characters, moderation in all things, effects, Jackson does seem to have gone the Lucas way and focused on style over substance.

The first hour was naff. Second rate. It looked cheap somehow in terms of the sets. It lacked sense in that the company broke into Beorn's house, he was furious as he should be, returned hours later, saw them sleeping and thought 'aww, I'll talk to them when they get up'. And everything turned out to be fine. Very poorly written. The second hour was better yet still just okay. Smaug however saved the film. True, it did get a little dumb in that the dwarves were doing the cliched 'over here!' and Smaug followed each dwarf that said that but then he is a near invincible dragon that probably enjoys the hunt. I liked those last 30 minutes more and more as they went on as the visuals improved (excluding the atrocious molten gold) and I felt actual tension for the first time. Contrary to the book, I think at least a few dwarves should've fallen victim to Smaug but overall I highly enjoyed it. I also liked Legolas' duel with Bolg, another tense bout with a present sense of danger as Legolas bled and was thrown around all over the place. He smashed Bolg's face into a pillar multiple times too, it was visceral. Gandalf's duel with Sauron was another highlight despite being evocative of Harry Potter. Sauron becoming the slit of the Eye of Sauron was the niftiest thing in the movie. Thranduil was perhaps my favourite character in it, with Lee Pace giving an excellent performance as the lofty immortal King. Seeing him visibly hurt by Thorin's powerfully expressed feelings of abandonment by the elves as the dwarves of Erebor were left homeless and desperate, as well as his reveal that he knew full well about the devastation dragons can bring spruced up the movie. His kingdom was not explored in the slightest, which was a massive disappointment. It's strange to say but it's true that the book delved more into it than the film. Even the spiders scene was very brief. Tauriel wasn't bad by any means, in fact she was one of the better characters but I wasn't exactly blown away by any of her scenes. The love triangle was both good and bad, though it did serve well to emphasise both her and Kili. Apart from the CGI, the worst factor about the movie was Bard's children using the word 'Da' so many times. Literally in every sentence, there was absolutely no subtlety at all. I got that they were supposed to be Welsh the first time but what felt like twenty times later, it irritated me to no end hearing it said so often in such a short space of time. I want Cinema Sins to do a video of DoS just so that they can count how many times 'da' is said. The Grima Wormtongue-esque character was a shameless duplicate and the result of weak writing. I know that Jackson and his team feel compelled to tie this trilogy in with LOTR but with all of the references, similar lines and characters, all but a small few were feebly executed.

It definitely sounds presumptuous but I think I could've done a better job at making a greater film, as what we've got feels like a draft. A template that needs to be worked on. It needed much more story and character development than constant barrages of action. It needed structure, stakes and moderation. What I will say in its favour is that the pace was brilliant; I was somehow never bored and kept wondering to myself how long had gone, because at one point I knew I was well over halfway through the film and it felt like just 20 minutes had passed.

4636410,5,B0059XTU3G,"I have struggled to accurately articulate my feelings about films being split into multiple parts.  Im not talking about sequels, trilogies, or franchises, but rather the recent trend of taking one story and splitting it into different films with different release dates.  Mixed reactions have surrounded the decision to split films like Kill Bill, Breaking Dawn, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, and the upcoming Hunger Games installment, Mockingjay into two films.  Some appreciate the expanded devotion to detail these films receive while others feel they result in bloated, watered down films designed to get doubled the box office.  Director Peter Jackson is mostly known for his Lord of the Rings films.  While, the third film in that series, Return of the King, clocks in at nearly four hours, Jackson never considered dividing it in half.  The film went on to be nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won every single one of them.  Jackson took a different route with J. R. R. Tolkiens The Hobbit, dividing the book into three films.  If anyone can make a film that convinces me of the merits of this decision, its Jackson, and The Hobbits second installment, The Desolation of Smaug just might be that film.

In classic middle-film-in-a-series fashion, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug opens with a brief flashback scene between Gandolf (Ian McKellen) and Thorin (Richard Armitage) to remind the audience about whats happening.  Bilbo (Martin Freeman) continues his quest to assist thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their lost kingdom.  A pivotal step in the process involves recovering the arkenstone from a terrifying dragon named Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) who dwells in the caverns of the Lonely Mountain guarding his riches.  Those who complain about how Jacksons Tolkien films spend too much time walking will be happy to hear that Bilbo and company do arrive at the Lonely Mountain with plenty of time to spare.  Like in the previous Lord of the Rings films, the characters do not all stay united in one plot for long.  Smaug finds Gandolf abandoning the band of dwarves to investigate the rise of a being known as the Necromancer whose threat on Middle Earth was introduced in the previous film.  Furthermore, the Mirkwood Elven Guard led by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) are introduced.  Tauriel represents the first major evidence of Jacksons and co-writer Guillermo del Toros decision to expand The Hobbit into three films.  Her character is not in the book and is created for the film.  Her role appears to be to add some romance into the mix as she catches the eye of both Legolas as well as one of the dwarves.  While introducing a female character for  strictly romantic purposes would be a bit shallow, Tauriel fits in well and holds her own as both a lover and a fighter.

The Desolation of Smaug, like The Two Towers, improves on the previous film.  There is more action, more humor, higher stakes, and purposeful character development.  Bilbo is in the throngs of ring delusion and Freeman plays this ambiguous stage in Bilbos life with deliberate hesitation and false bravado.  While the film catches a small snag when Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) enters the scene, it in no way minimizes the excellent final act where Bilbo and the dwarves square off against Smaug.  If you enjoyed the classic game of wits between Bilbo and Gollum in the first film, you will love the battle of egos between Smaug and Bilbo as he attempts to fulfill his role as Burglar.

The Desolation of Smaug is an exciting, beautiful, and thrilling film with plenty of excitement for any moviegoer.  The debate on whether the decision to split this film into three parts takes a substantial hit as the second installment is quite good.  Tolkien aficionados may resent some of the additional material added like Tauriel or Gandolfs scenes, but these additions are in keeping with the look, feel, and tradition of The Hobbit and the Tolkien universe.

Okay, I can get showing some of the stuff that was alluded to but ""off stage"" in the original, or alluded to as backstory from the LOTR might be interesting.  I can get that the walking and walking and walking through Mirkwood might not play well on the screen and the reasons for compressing it.  I can even see compressing Bilbo's three trips down the whole to the Dragon's lair into one as making a certain cinematic sense.  But _where_ did that romantic subplot come from?

Still and all, I liked this one better than the first.  The two big battles--on the river and under the mountain--weren't as outrageous as ""falling with style"" in the first one (if you saw it, you know what I mean), but they were still pretty over the top.

What all of them AND the director of this mess did was bore me to tears, have one of my friends foaming at the mouth because the movie so bastardized the book, and it put my other friend to sleep.  The viewer is asked to spend over two hours of the movie listening to trite ""love"" conversations, watching many CGI battles, watching many CGI spiders, and NEVER seeing Gandolf in ""clean"" mode.  When the dragon FINALLY appears (and let me tell you there were people who had left the theatre LONG before this happens), it was like meh; who cares?

Peter Jackson and the rest of these knuckle-dragging troglodytes should be beaten with huge clubs for this 3-hour plus debacle.  And if that isn't bad enough, there is no payoff at the end!!!

In this episode we are introduced to a passionate elf named Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) one of the bright spots of the film. I thought the spiders were more realistic. Tauriel reiterates a basic theme ""Are we not part of this world?"" When good people stand by, evil wins.

It was interesting to see Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in this film as it establishes his relationship with the dwarfs to create better story continuity. At the same time the continuity is lost as we never have that scene in LOTR when Legolas says to Gimli, ""Hey, I met your father."" Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) once again appears in the Hobbit, a wizard cut out of LOTR for ""brevity."" If only we could go back and film it all over.

The film ends at an awkward point. Most people I have talked to claimed this was better than the first installment with more action. I will admit I enjoyed the first feature better, and of all the 5 films released to date, I would rate this as the weakest.

4636415,5,B0059XTU3G,"The danger of telling people what you think about a ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Hobbit"" movie is how insanely critical they are about its similarity and faithfulness to the book. I am one of those at all times, with any movie that is based on a book, that I don't mind a little deviation and even some embellishment. Movies and books are two different entities.

Books are better because they allow you to imagine on your own how things look and feel or you get inside the head of your characters to see what they are thinking. Two people will never imagine the same thing. Movies are better because they do everything visually for you, but they are also saddled with time constraints and the necessity to keeps things moving and interesting.

""The Desolation of Smaug"" has received much criticism prior to being viewed because they elected to stretch one book, ""The Hobbit"", into three movies. Many wondered if it could be rationalized or if it were even possible to 'stretch' the book. Well, with now five movies and a sixth on the way, the lore of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth seems to be momentous. Peter Jackson did stretch ""The Hobbit"" into three movies and he did it because the material is so full of possibilities. In fact, instead of making us realize that it were possible, he also proved that doing anything less would have been insufficient. Sure, he spruced it up with some things and characters that weren't in the book, but they only added to the movie.

""The Desolation of Smaug"" is another middle movie in a 3-movie set and not unlike ""Hunger Games"", you should know this going in because the conclusion ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" comes out next Christmas. You're paying for an adventure and it is a great one, but the journey, while long, is made even longer by 12 months of separation. Being a middle movie though, it potentially holds all the best parts. The middle after all holds the build up and realization of the great dangers our characters face. Bilbo Baggins' purpose on the journey becomes more realized and the insurmountable danger that is the dragon Smaug is introduced.

""The Hobbit"" is a product of my childhood that holds a special place. As a child and a teenager, the richness of adventure and escapism dripped from the books pages. The characters were so vivid in my mind that I spent many days outside of reading the books, thinking I was still there in Middle Earth. The director, Peter Jackson, is taking what all of us could only imagine and making it real and tangible. While he may have some critics for introducing characters like Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) to begin with, by doing so he brought the Wood Elves to the for-front of the story; something the books didn't do, and we should be thanking him for that.

Peter Jackson's take on ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" is epic movie-making, and if anything is worth the price of admission, popcorn and refreshment, it is. Is it flawless? Absolutely not. Do I wish it were more ""Game of Thrones"" sometimes instead of ""Looney Tunes""? Absolutely! Some of the sequences are extremely silly; in ""Unexpected Journey"" the escape from Goblin Town and in ""Desolation"" the barrels smashing Orcs sequence. As a whole though, it's an amazing realization and it's all we got. I'm not gonna waste an ounce of energy complaining.

4636417,4,B0059XTU3G,"Nine Things About ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug""

1. This is the second part of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, and it is epic fantasy adventure at its height.

2. While the first movie was pretty good, it was kind of slow and had too much singing in it. But all that has been fixed for this one.

3. It picks up right where the first one ended, so if you don't remember the first one (or never saw it), you will be pretty lost. Subplots keep spinning off the main plot, and there's a lot to keep track of.

4. Gandalf keeps wandering off by himself and muttering to other characters about a growing danger (knowledge of ""The Lord of the Rings"" helps out here). The part where he confronts the necromancer is trippy and chilling. It's one of the best single cinematic scenes of the year.

5. The official story is scattered around in here, but considering how short the book is (not to mention how poorly written), director Peter Jackson had to add (or change) a lot of stuff to make it last for another movie. A lot of stuff.

6. Most of the stuff Jackson added is great. I'm not a fan of the little love triangle that forms (elf-dwarf love doesn't seem like it would work out very well), but the movie really fleshes out characters and scenes that are flat and flavorless in the book.

7. Jackson's depiction of Middle-Earth is gorgeous and inspired. The various kingdoms and towns and towers all have their own distinct appearance and character, and they are all epic in their own way.

8. Director Peter Jackson has a cameo in the first 30 seconds of the movie. There's a rumor that Stephen Colbert has a cameo in the river town, but I never saw him.

9. The movie is worth seeing just for the dragon. He doesn't show up until the last half of the movie, but once he appears, you won't be leaving your seat to go to the bathroom.",1387324800,,1830,4.3274853801169595

I myself grew up with these books and have read them countless times and have very very few gripes with either the first or second film even with Peter Jackson's additions. Books and film are different formats and that's all there is to it and with very few exceptions (Fear and Loathing in Las Vergas) most are going to have significant changes and not always for the worst.  Take these films for what they are, fun and entertainment because if you try and pick them apart because they didn't do this exactly right or that was different then you are missing the point.  I took my 8yr old son to see it this past weekend and he was blown away with the way the film envelopes you and the magic that Peter Jackson has brought to life once again.

Honestly, I was rather disappointed myself in the reduced pace of The Hobbit, but what do you expect after experiencing one grand battle after another over the course of the entire Rings trilogy? After going back to watch the extended version of An Unexpected Journey, it's really unfair to compare The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings. After all, The Hobbit simply serves as the build-up to everything that happens in The Rings films. This is a natural progression of a lengthy story, and like the brutal critics of the Star Wars prequels, you should try to look at this films as one more chapter of continuity.

The story picks up where An Unexpected Journey leaves off in the aftermath of the battle with the orcs. After a brief flashback where Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) approaches Thorin (Richard Armitage) about reclaiming the Arkenstone, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the rest of the dwarfs continue their journey towards the Lonely Mountain  currently inhabited by the sleeping dragon, Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch).

As the story progresses, the dwarfs make contact with several new allies, including Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), the last of the skin-changers, who openly detests dwarfs  but hates orcs even more. Following their interaction with Beorn, the dwarfs encounter a group of oversized spiders (shudder), and then a familiar pack of elves, including Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and his love interest, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). Also aiding in the assistance of the dwarfs along the way is Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans), an archer and heir of Girion, the last King of Old Dale. Bard possesses the Black Arrow, a specially forged spear that was supposedly used by his ancestors to dislodge a portion of Smaug's iron skin. Bard believes the small vulnerability is the only way to defeat and kill the dragon.

Like the last film, Bilbo and the dwarfs are constantly being hounded by a group of orcs, led by Thorin's arch-nemesis, Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett). Driven mostly by revenge after having his hand chopped off, Azog (a character completely absent from the novel minus a brief reference) is about as relentless of a villain as they come. He serves as the most substantial bad guy, not only in this sequel, but also thus far in the entire Hobbit trilogy. However, roughly half-way through the film, Azog is pulled off his quest for revenge when he is put in charge of the ever-growing dark army of the Necromancer (I wonder who that turns out to be...). Naturally, Gandalf will discover the Necromancer's identity in the closing minutes of the film  leading prominently to the major events of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Truth be told, if you weren't a fan of The Rings trilogy, the odds that you'll enjoy The Hobbit trilogy is next to zilch  and that's coming from someone that's gradually allowing these films to grow on him. This all goes back to the endless argument that The Hobbit should have been made first, followed by The Lord of the Rings films. Obviously, that would have made the most sense  but a smart idea isn't always the best, meaning everyone should be happy The Hobbit films were even made at all. Even so, it's still mind-boggling how each Rings novel got its own film, but The Hobbit (one novel itself) somehow manages a trilogy of its own. For those complaining The Hobbit films drag a bit, you can thank whoever made that call for it being so slow, repetitive, and borderline uneventful. Now matter what anyone says, The Hobbit could have easily been dipicted in a single three hour film, yet here we are  starring a nine hour trilogy in the face (after it's fully complete, or course).

Earlier, I mentioned that I watched the extended version of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey prior to viewing the sequel, and it makes a world of difference. So, for anyone that hasn't watched the sequel yet, a re-visiting of the first film might be in order (naturally this is for the causal fan and not the diehard observes that watch it every other day). With that being said, The Desolation of Smaug features a relatively quicker pace than its predecessor. Bilbo and the dwarfs are almost constantly battling either orcs, elves, spiders, or a rather elaborate dragon. The nearly endless conflict and battles sequences will fully encapsulate your attention  even if some of the scenes are ridiculous and preposterous (an elf jumping across barrels in a rapid-filled river? Seriously?) Regardless, the CGI is still eye-popping and the mountainous scenery is undeniably gorgeous.

Martin Short, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage once again brilliantly dominate the majority of the screen time, providing plenty of significant moments. To causal viewers, it will feel like anywhere and everywhere these characters go, they are either being chased, abducted, or plotted against  and you're not wrong. As no surprise, McKellen is a screen-stealer through and through, while Short is far less of an annoyance this time around and fully embraces his role on this journey. His interaction with Smaug, voiced pleasantly by Benedict Cumberbatch, is unspeakably brilliant and well worth the price of admission. The special effects gurus spared no expense on Smaug's enormity. And, if you're familiar with the novel, you should look forward to the prominence of Armitage's portrayal in the final chapter, There and Back Again.

Overall, The Desolation of Smaug is a step up from An Unexpected Journey, full of new and familiar faces. Obviously, this is a lengthy feature, but thankfully it doesn't feel nearly as long as An Unexpected Journey. At the same time, this sequel can easily be recognized as the continuation of the first film since these films are literally shot together or very closely following one another. The action sequences and stunning visuals are just as impressive now as they were on The Rings films. They are especially impressive when featuring Smaug, and there's absolutely no chance you won't at least enjoy the third act of this film, which heavily features the dragon. True, The Hobbit films can feel repetitive and uneventful at times, but with the final chapter of this trilogy coming in December 2014, it's safe to say this lengthy trilogy will constantly be reexamined and remembered as a classic by the time all is said and done. It won't be remembered as prominently as say Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings, but it is impressive none-the-less.

I would not be surprised if he created a checklist of all the changes, twists and additions he would make prior to creating the film.

All of the original material in the story of Bilbo Baggins has been changed, save the names of the characters.

4636421,2,B0059XTU3G,"Warning. Heavy spoilers

This film doesn't really have much to do with The Hobbit. Its more about Peter Jackson's interpretations of Tolkien taking on a life of their own and now replacing the source material entirely. While Peter Jackson's style of the doing Lord of the Riings held together nicely for three films, with the fifth film, its starting to drown in its own cliches (visual, dramatic and otherwise). For people who liked Peter Jackson's earlier films, this will be ""ok"". It gives you more of the same but nothing really special.

The title character is mostly pushed to the back of his own story. Its as if he has to be there, but the script really doesn't want him there. Azog wasn't exactly a great villian but they double down and now give us two Azogs for the price of one. Anytime the orcs are on screen doing anything but fighting they suck the wind out of the story.

They use Beorn in the story, but again it seems like they didn't want to. He is quickly introduced as a big monster with a chase scene and then they get out of the scene as fast they possibly can while giving minimal information about the character for later.

To me, one of the core elements of the Hobbit story is the idea of this collection of people on a sucide mission meeting all of these different people who are all dealing with problems individually and getting them through the story to all come together to solve their problem in the end. The script never quite gets that right. Its always focused on the wrong things. In the book, Gandalf carefully wins over Beorn. But in this film, he is just kind of a speed bump between Orc chases.

The elf scenes are boring. They add a new character which is basically Legolas in drag and do the whole forbidden romance angle with one of the dwarves.

Then we get to the lake. Bard is elevated to a major character with the same cliche tragic past as nearly every other character. In the book, Bard and the leader of the town are both minor characters. But for some reason, the film pours time and energy into them. All that needed to be established about the leader of the town was that he was a lazy, greedy coward. But instead the town on the lake has to be set up as some sort of proto-fascist kingdom of the dark ages. This highlights one of the major problems of the film. They ignore what matters in story terms while at the same time increasing the role of story elements that just don't matter.

Smaug looks good, but he lacks the necessary sense of menace. For the story to work, Smaug has to be the ""nuclear bomb"" of monsters. Something so dangerous that messing around with it risks total disaster. Maybe its monster fatigue, but he doesn't seem like anything special. The talk with Bilbo wasn't all that great even though all they had to do was basically lift whats in the book to make it work.

Then the film blows itself up. Its slapstick comedy time with our lovable dragon and our wacky dwarfs. They kill any sense of menace associated with Smaug. Then there is a whole wacky plan to annoy Smaug which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Smaug becomes so enraged at their stupid plan that he goes off to do the humans a favor and burn down their horrible rotting town.

For unclear reasons, Peter Jackson rewrites the character history of the Nazgul and large parts of Tolkien. They now have tombs and Sauron raises them from the dead which is kind of strange given that they are undead to begin with. Then he makes the fatal mistake that Tolkien never did. He sends Gandalf out to fight Sauron one-on-one. Nothing good can come of that fight and nothing does. But I guess the idea of him sneaking into the fortress among Sauron's followers, discovering who he was and then escaping to get everyone to launch the war was just too boring for a film like this. We would have also lost another redundant Azog scene or Orc chase #21. Or bad elf/dwarf romance scene #5.

The problem with everything is that this just isn't the Hobbit. This is literally the Lord of the Rings prequel Trilogy and this is Peter Jackson's attack of the Clones. For all the cost, its lazy, poorly thought out in terms of story and almost completely derivative. Tolkien gave them more than enough ""untold"" story around the main story of the Hobbit to expand things out as much as they wanted in an easy way. But they refused to use it.

Its not that they did a terrible job. Its that they could have done better than this. Large budgets and almost assured success should lead to taking small chances. I mean they could have at the very least done something original in terms of design rather than simply recycling design elements from Lord of the Rings.

--------------------------------

While I didn't include it in the original review, I'll add some additional information and a theory about what went wrong with this film.

The Hobbit was originally intended to be two films. After a large part of the second (and final) film was shot, it was decided to make the Hobbit a trilogy. It was made into a trilogy but cutting the original second film in half (more or less) and then padding it out with additional new material. Its a bad script because there was no script written for a second film - its half a script with padding. Its a bad ending because whats on screen was written as second act comedy rather than an ending. The pieces of the the film that are short were short because they were probably going to be DVD extras. The pieces of the film that seem like padding (all those orc chases) *were* padding. Certain bad or redundant scenes would have ended up on the cutting room floor during editing if this had been the final film.

When they decided to make it a trilogy, they had a choice. They could have either made an artistic decision to write a new script for a second (and third film) and junk many already completed scenes. Or they could make an economic decision to re-use as much of the film they had already shot as possible and to make it work as a film as best they could. To me, it seems clear that they made the economic decision.",1387152000,35,6085,4.449730700179534

But having him stumble and trip over his own tail , chasing a dozen dwarves or so , is a travesty .
Is this smaug the great ? Is this the same dragon that destroyed Dale and drove the dwarves out of
Erebor ?
maybe dragons get senile when they get old . Or maybe Peter Jackson got senile in his old age .
This is the weakest of the 5 movies about middle earth .

One of my favorite parts of the hobbit ( the book ) was the journey through mirkwood .
In the movie it seemed more like a walk in the park , instead of a long journey through a dangerous
And forbidding forest . One minute they enter the forest , and the next they are on the other side
Being captured by spiders . Where is the enchanted stream ? Where is the elvish feast ?
 It's still a good movie , but it could have been a lot better if Peter followed the book more closely .

4636433,4,B0059XTU3G,"Peter Jacksons middle chapter to The Hobbit trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug (TDOS) is good, but not great.

We pick up right where An Unexpected Journey (AUJ) left our band of adventurers. Immediately, the film jumps into a quickly paced series of events. We meet Beorn (although his intro and time spent here is far to short), and quickly the troop finds themselves in Mirkwood. Racing along at record pace, the dwarves and Mr. Baggins find themselves in one perilous circumstances after another. Spiders, Mirkwood elves, orcs, etc.

Given the overly long moments from AUJ, this films initial quick pace is as much a boon as it is a burden. The environments of Beorns home, Mirkwood and the elvish kingdom are so short that its hard to really get a solid grasp. Theyre beautiful sets, but less time is given to them than they deserve.

In terms of the characters, film-created Tauriel (Evangeline Lily) fits right into the story. She feels right at home and welcomed to a male-centric story. Fan favorite Legolas is back and is less wise and more teen-like in his approach which fits with his character progression from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bard (Luke Evans) is well done as is the Master of Laketown (Stephen Fry). Theyre brief roles ultimately in this film, but the pieces are set for their stories in the final chapter of The Hobbit trilogy. Yet, despite all this, the one incredible performance that deserves a ton of credit is Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). Cumberbatch breathes fire (pardon the pun) into Smaug and you can feel the repressed hate of dwarves in his performance.

Visually, Smaug is stunning, as is the scene between Bilbo and Smaug. Their back and forth conversation is ripped right off the page and is a joy to watch unfold. This all leads to the most disappointing part of the film, which is sadly the climax. I won't say more other than its far too long and someone suffers from a complete characteristic reversal.

TDOS isn't a bad movie. It has breathtaking visuals, amazing set pieces and is fun but its missing a few things to really make it great. In retrospect, it ends in a logical place, but sitting in the theater, I was surprised when it ended. I had expected the story to get farther along. Middle chapters in trilogies sometimes suffer because the film doesnt really end and doesnt tie anything up, thats for the conclusion obviously, so maybe after we see the final chapter, my reaction will change. Until then, its absolutely worth seeing, but odds are you won't be blown away other than by a few choice moments and scenes.",1387152000,5,2583,4.731111111111111

Rossini is supposed to have said of Wagner that he had some wonderful moments, but dreadful quarter-hours. You might say the same thing of Peter Jackson: there is something Bayreuthian about the excess of everything in his Hobbit saga. Still, he seems to have retained the confidence of the reviewing community: I wonder whether it will last another instalment.

In the months before Ray Harryhausens recent passing, giants of cinema from James Cameron to Nick Park, notably including Peter Jackson, queued to salute the stop-motion king. It was Harryhausen who fired the imaginations of these young auteurs as they watched raging plasticene dinosaurs and rickety skeleton warriors duke it out with Sinbad, Jason, Raquel Welch and others across countless other corny heroic fantasies a now bygone era.

Harryhausen was undoubtedly a matinee genius but the films he worked on were, in their day, technological more than cinematic achievements. (Sample quote, from Seventh Voyage of Sinbad: Classic Harryhausen. May not be heavy on plot, but who cares?)

George Lucas, a fellow Harryhausen devotee, never pretended his Star Wars franchise was anything other than straight-up homage to the comic book serials and B-grade melodramas of his youth. But Peter Jackson, for all his due deference, is supposed to have aspired to greater things. With the second instalment of his interminable Hobbit saga we now know this not to be the case: it is pure, cornball Harryhausen for the 21st century, Pentium processors replacing plastic stegosauruses but otherwise every bit as cheesy and, in the leaden sequences between cave-girl-fancying monster tortoises, just as tedious anything from One Million Years BC.

No doubt bored of reverend Tolkien scholarship, Jackson has started making stuff up and has oriented all drama around what his inner Harryhausen likes best: scowling orcs, growling wargs, rutting beasts, fruity elves and improbable hand-to-hand combat between the lot of them.

As far as Tolkien was concerned there were hardly any orcs, no Sauron, few Elves and no Legolas in the Hobbit. However pleasing Evangeline Lillys elven features may be, Tauriel doesnt even feature in the appendices, and she certainly didn't flirt with any dwarves. Why Jackson felt the need to insert dreadful quarter-hours of these creatures hacking each other to bits is difficult to fathom. There are some inventive kills, but none of the action bears at all on the plot. But at least the orcs and fairies do dispose of one other: no-one can lay a finger on the dwarves, and good old Dildo lives a charmed life throughout.

Countless other secondary characters buzz the screenplay like so many horseflies. They too could also have used a morgul blade to the chops: Stephen Frys walk-on is surplus to requirements, as is Legolas, and a shape-shifting bear man, some well-rendered but time-wasting spiders, a new orc 2. I.C. and the rabbit-wizard from the first instalment (this time minus his bunny sled) do nothing but slow the progress of our dogged little dwarves.

Finally they do reach their Lonely Mountain (sorry if this gives the game away) only to find a monologuing dragon who won't shut up for 45 minutes and who, while anticipating their every move, somehow cannot so much as singe a ginger beard. He lies on a treasure of coins and valuables so large that he could, were he properly advised, defeat the dwarves, Shire People, Lake People, Orcs, Elves, Rohirrin and probably even Sauron himself simply by dumping his hoard of currency outside the mountain. Theres not a dark force on Earth to rival the awesome power of hyperinflation.

Meantime we wonder whether we haven't been sold the most outrageous pup. The result of our three hours toil is a series of scoreless draws: Dragon versus Dwarves; Orcs versus Elves; Elves versus Dwarves; Lake People versus Dwarves; Dwarves versus Dragon; Dragon versus Hobbit; Boatman versus Lake People; Dragon versus Boatman; Necromancer versus Wizard; and Bear-shape-shifter against himself. Jackson apologists will say it is all yet to kick off but, by gum, we shouldnt have had to wait this long for some resolution. Nine hours is not three but SIX standard-length feature films.

One ruthlessly edited feature film ought to have done the job, even if it meant Orlando Bloom and Stephen Fry missing a trip to the Land of the Long White Cloud.

Tchaikovsky said of Gotterdammerung that, after its last notes rang, he felt as though he had been let out of prison. As the feeling seeps back into your buttocks and you join the snaking queue for the loo at your local theatre, you may well know how he felt.

4636436,4,B0059XTU3G,"Peter Jackson's second installment of the Hobbit trilogy is a nice step up from the somewhat disappointing ""An Unexpected Journey."" The film is still a bit long and would have been helped with crisper editing, but it is still full of exciting action sequences. After a brief prequel which shows how and why Gandalf (Ian McKellen) comes to meet with Thorin (Richard Armitage), the story picks up where ""Journey"" ends.

The dozen Dwarves led by Thorin, Gandalf and the Hobbit recruit, Bilbo (Martin Freeman) continue their journey toward reclaiming their Lonely Mountain home. The hollowed mountain is now occupied by Smaug, a fierce dragon who sleeps under mountains of gold. With the ever present Orcs always on their tale, the Dwarves must pass through a barren forest that is also the home of the Elves. The Dwarves and the Elves consider themselves enemies as the Elves retreated years earlier rather that help the Dwarves fight Smaug. The Dwarves encounter a nest of giant spiders before being captured by the Elves. Their capture is short lived however thanks to Bilbo's ingenuity and of course ""Precious"" the gold ring that he possesses.

Evangeline Lilly enters the story as Tauriel, an Elven warrior and potential love interest for Legolas (returning Orlando Bloom). Tauriel, however becomes smitten with Kili (Aidan Turner), one of the Dwarves. As she says, ""he seems tall for a Dwarf."" There is an intense, if overly long, action sequence during this section where Legolas and Tauriel fight with the Dwarves against the marauding Orcs. I've come to the conclusion that as ominous and fierce as the Orcs appear they are only at their best against children and old men and women. They couldn't kill a Dwarf or an Elf unless they were unarmed.

Eventually, our heroes make their way to Lake-town which sits near the Lonely Mountain. This is a village that Smaug desolated after driving out the Dwarves. With help from newcomer Girion (Luke Evans), the Dwarves obtain weapons and make their way to the mountain and their confrontation with the sleeping Smaug. I've always liked dragons and Jackson and his crew have concocted a good one. Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch (he also does the Necromancer), Smaug and Bilbo have some great scenes. Freeman shows his acting chops here. Watch his facial expressions as he interacts with the dragon. The film is beautifully shot and the fantasy world of Tolkien looks magnificent. At times, I thought the first installment was just a little too CGI. Lilly and Evans are nice additions and give the story a bit of emotional drama. I'm looking forward to the concluding episode.

(BLU RAY 3-D UPDATE)

This is another look at the second chapter of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy which will conclude in December, 2014.  I was anxious to see it again, this time on Blu ray 3-D.  I was impressed enough with the 3-D ness of the picture to raise the rating half a star.  And as is often the case, I liked the film better the second time around.  For someone not immersed in the books and intricate details, a second viewing makes things a little clearer.  The overall picture is impressive even in 2-D.

The 3-D version is spread out over 2 discs.  The video resolution is 1080p and the film maintains the original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  This version runs 161 minutes.  The film as a whole runs darker, both in theme and visuals, from the original ""Unexpected Journey.""  Still the black levels are excellent, the colors are beautiful and the detail is crisp and nicely focused.  I was very impressed with the 3-D version.  Rare are those shots I hate.  The ones seemingly shot over the shoulder of one of the out of focus characters in the foreground.  Instead with get luxurious longs shots of the forest, the river and the castles provide depth to the scenes.  I'm not usually a big fan of 3D, but this is one of the best I've seen.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  It is excellent throughout although I did think the deep bass (LFE .1) was lacking without adjusting by subs.  Otherwise, the surrounds were active constantly.  The whole experience was very convincing.  Well done.  Here are the extras:

4636437,5,B0059XTU3G,"I liked this second part of ""Hobbit"" film trilogy, even if the changes made to the original story become here as large and sometimes as vicious and destructive as Smaug the Magnificent. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS, which I tried to keep to strict minimum.

First, the good stuff:

1) Visually this film is breath-taking! Mirkwood, Dol Guldur, Erebor, and of course Smaug - pure perfection. Creatures were also very well made, with the attercops (ettercaps) from Mirkwood and Bolg, son of Azog being the most impressive.

2) The excellent casting. Not one mistake, and that includes Evangeline Lilly, who did a great job even if her controversial character Tauriel shouldn't be here at all... (see below). Special acclamation for Stephen Fry as Master of Lake-town of Esgaroth

3) Acoustics and music. Flawless.

4) Certain (but not all - see below) changes and additions to the story were well done and are very welcome, even if they take really big liberties with Tolkien's lore. Amongst them my favourites are the dark tombs in high mountains of Rhudaur and the long sequence in which Gandalf finally discovers who EXACTLY is the master of the ""abandoned"" fortress of Dol Guldur. I also rather liked the glimpse into the background of Elvish king Thranduil, as it explains why is he such an a-hole...

5) Some of most humorous action scenes. I liked the deliberately over the top character of some of the stunts during supposedly very dramatic fights - it very pleasantly reminds of the lighter tone of ""Hobbit"" as compared with the much more serious, darker and violent ""Lord of the Rings"".

6) Some insight into Orcs minds, especially when one of them, made prisoner by Elves, is interrogated... I found this scene very good and I wouldn't mind to hear more from the Orcs to know more of their point of view about all this Middle Earth business...

There were also things which I liked less, even if they can be defended:

1. Tauriel. Peter Jackson shouldn't create her and honestly, Evangeline Lilly shouldn't have accepted this role, because adding such an important character is no more ""licentia poetica"", this is RAPING Tolkien's books by conceding to political correctness... Nowhere in Tolkien's books are there elvish female warriors - extremely powerful and influent elvish females of course existed, but they were spell-casters and charm-weavers like Galadriel or Luthien, not shield-maidens.

BUT, that being said, considering that what is done is done, I must concede that Tauriel is definitely not half-bad looking and also that the strange game she plays with Legolas and Kili is interesting to watch. She certainly is one kinky, flirtatious wench and maybe even more than that - me I wouldn't be surprised if she was in fact a cynical manipulative vixen, playing poor Kili to try to inflame Legolas feelings and therefore bed her way into royalty...

2. Master of the Lake-town. In the book he was greedy and cowardly but he was an elected leader respected for his ability. Why destroying completely this character and make him a kind of little tyrant? BUT, on another hand, that gives Stephen Fry an occasion to fully deploy his great talent...

But then there were also some things and changes which simply went too far and can NOT be forgiven:

1. Portrayal of humans and their dwellings. Both Bree and Esgaroth are really kind of disgusting, with mud, waste and dirt everywhere, as opposed to perfectly neat cities of Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits. Sapristi, even the supposedly evil fortress of Dol Guldur, infested by orcs, wargs and attercops, is not as piggishly disgusting as those two human cities! And most of people living there are ugly and wear horrible, colourless, dirty rags! This was already a little bit annoying in ""Lord of the Rings"", in which we saw people from Rohan and even from mighty Minas Tirith dressed as beggars in deep mourning - here that is really too much!

2. Beorn. Even if he looks impressive in both of his shapes, his character was comprehensively jarjarbinksed and for some reason Peter Jackson deprived us of one of the merriest scenes in the book (the one in which Gandalf tells Beorn the story by introducing more and more dwarves...). Let's not lose all hope however - maybe at least this scene can be somehow re-introduced in the extended version...

3. Too many useless, repetitive fights between Elves and Orcs. All those scenes could be assets rather than issues, if the Orcs were able to score at least one point from time to time - but in this film they are completely hapless sword and arrow fodder. Many dozens of Orcs appear in fights in this film and even if they always come loaded for bear and have the numbers for them all they achieve is to bring down one elf and inflict a wound on one dwarf... Then, if they are so pathetically clueless warriors, why even run away from them!? That one sided character of fights makes them finally boring...

4. SPOILER HERE! Considerable change in the whole conversation of Bilbo with Smaug and especially the stupendously idiotic Bilbo's decision to reveal himself to the dragon by taking off his ring -followed by Smaug NOT eating him... That was one SUPER BIG BLUNDER which absolutely cannot be forgiven...

CONCLUSION: that part is of a lesser quality than the first one, but still, it is a great show which I enjoyed mightily and all the good things ultimately overweighed the bad ones. I am going to buy the Extended Version DVD as soon as it is available and I will now wait impatiently to see the last part of the trilogy next year.",1387152000,,5573,4.806687565308255
4636438,3,B0059XTU3G,"Taking the movie on its own terms, it's generally fun.  As a representation of Tolkien's vision, it's absurd.  I am not a big Tolkien fan, finding his descriptions of journeys tedious, so it didn't bother me much.  The flavor of his work is not at all like the superhero genre that Peter Jackson has turned The Hobbit into.  But I still enjoyed it because the landscapes, believability of the computerized images, and thrills are very amazing.  I think The Hobbit should have been one 3-hour movie instead of three 3-hour movies.  There is far less similarity to Tolkien's books in The Hobbit movies than in The Lord of the Rings.

As far as specifics go in this movie, there are some exciting thrills involving Legolas vs. orcs and a journey of barrels down rapids and waterfalls, and a while later, the first meeting that Bilbo has with Smaug the dragon.  The voice of Smaug, I must add, is very good.  The movie eventually felt bloated to me when the unrealistic escapes of the dwarves from Smaug's fire went on and on, getting less realistic all the time.  But I loved the sets, especially Laketown and Erebor, the kingdom under the mountain where Smaug lies.  I much prefer the animated Rankin-Bass version, but there are some amazing thrills and sights in Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies that you won't experience otherwise.  And there are some really interesting characterizations, too.

Like every other Peter Jackson Tolkien film, this has those stilted, ultra-serious lines that are either spoken with defiance or in a hushed tone, with archaic, poetic sentence construction.  I always get a kick out of the scripts to Jackson's Tolkien movies because of those lines.  I'm sure they're meant to be taken really seriously, but I just find myself laughing inside.  And Legolas's invincibility is the same way!  He gets a really minor injury and is shocked on the movie, which is funny, because you'd think that when he gets that scared look, he got really badly injured.  It's probably the first time he's been injured!  Another really big laugh for me came from the ending, which of course wouldn't be funny anymore if I shared what it is!

So I found it surprisingly funny, though in a ""campy"" sort of way.  (Wikipedia defines ""camp"" as ""an aesthetic sensibility that regards something as appealing or humorous because of its ridiculousness to the viewer"", and Dictionary.com defines it as ""consciously artificial"" and ""self-parodying"".)  It also had very amazing sets and landscape shots and some very exciting thrills, though I think it overplayed those thrills toward the end and lessened some of the excitement as a result.  Mainly for those reasons, I enjoyed it.  If I were really into Tolkien, I'd have been really annoyed, because it takes a ton of liberties, including having an interracial romance between an elf and dwarf, orcs/goblins and wargs (goblin wolves) constantly chasing after the dwarves and Bilbo, making Sauron directly interested in the dwarves' journey, and a completely different way the Smaug interactions happen.  I don't get why Smaug keeps prolonging the confrontation with the characters (he actually just meets Bilbo, not the other dwarves, in the book, but in this movie, he meets all of 'em and it gets turned into a major, and rather extreme, action scene at the end).  There are lots of times when Smaug could eliminate them with fire when Bilbo and the others are right in front of his eyes, when Bilbo's not even using the Ring.  But like I said, it's kind of a ""campy"" movie for me and enjoyable in enough ways that I gave it 3 stars.",1387065600,,3582,4.839080459770115
4636439,4,B0059XTU3G,"They have fought past goblins, trolls and a corrupted forest, but now Bilbo and the dwarves will face their worst enemy: the dragon Smaug.

And despite some big deviations from the Tolkien source material (did we really need a romantic subplot for Kili?), ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a riveting, passionate ride. Lots of action, lots of strong acting all around, and a dragon who is genuinely scary -- not to mention more groundwork for the original ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.

Thorin's company sets out on a perilous quest through Mirkwood, where they encounter the spooky skin-changer Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), Azog's orcs and an infestation of spiders. But the most dangerous is the wood-elves led by the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace), whom Bilbo (Martin Freeman) must free the imprisoned dwarves from.

Even worse, Gandalf isn't with them -- he must investigate the threat coming from Dol Guldur. First he ventures into death-trap graves in the fells, and then into the heart of the old fortress itself.

Meanwhile, the dwarves smuggline themselves into Laketown, with the help of the bowman Bard (Luke Evans). But Bard soon discovers their true mission, and believes that Thorin's (Richard Armitage) quest will rouse the dragon to kill them all. And when Bilbo is sent alone into the mountain, he will find that that may just happen...

If there is one word to describe the second ""Hobbit"" movie, it's ""passionate."" There are many scenes that brim over with powerful emotion -- moments of crushing despair, triumph, and a grinding sense of fear as Bilbo must grapple with a building-sized dragon who clearly is scaring him out of his little hobbit pants.

Jackson also seems happiest when exploring the grander parts of Middle-Earth -- he lingers lovingly on the gold-filled halls of Erebor, the sweeping parts of Mirkwood, and the autumnal beauty of the Elf-king's hall. One of the most spectacular scenes is when Gandalf discovers the true horror in Dol Guldur, a nightmare of fire and shadow that even a wizard cannot hold out against for long.

But there are also some small nice moments, such as Thorin commanding a sick Kili to stay behind, Balin's little talk with the increasingly gutsy Bilbo, or Tauriel talking about the Elves' love of starlight. Little quiet moments in a very loud, action-packed story.

Flaws? It feels top-heavy with wildly over-the-top action (including a very long sequence of orc-killing in Laketown), and the whole subplot about Tauriel and Kili is filler. And corny.

Armitage truly gives a tour-de-force performance in this movie. His smoldering stare and deep voice give a sense of depth and weight to Thorin's quest, and he runs Thorin through despair, anger, sorrow and eventually the commanding strength of a king. Freeman gives a subtler but no less good performance, as Bilbo grows further in courage and strength, which makes his fear before Smaug even more striking.

All the other actors do excellent jobs, and some of them (James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Ken Stott, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner) get some nice development. Orlando Bloom also makes a grand reappearance as a pre-tolerance Legolas, who kicks much butt in typically hyperacrobatic elven style (and shows us why Legolas doesn't usually use a sword).

We also have some new faces: Luke Evans is broodingly noble as the humble bowman Bard, Stephen Fry is grotesque as the Master of Laketown, and Lee Pace plays the regal Elf King with a fierce temper and a core of desperation, elegant and sinuous at all times. Benedict Cumberbatch also does magnificent double-duty -- he briefly voices the Necromancer (which is pretty terrifying itself) and also the rich, seductively vicious voice of Smaug, who slyly messes with Bilbo as he slinks through the golden halls.

Despite being too long and a bit too actiony, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a much more powerful, intense affair than the first ""Hobbit"" movie... but with a multi-cliffhanger. Definitely a must-see.",1387065600,2,4000,5.053110773899848

My review of The Hobbit in no particular order, with LOTS OF SPOILERS.
It's perhaps the same old story: you go into a theater with low expectations, and it's worse than you knew it would be. Far worse. This is 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' in a nutshell. But I'm not here to give you a nutshell. This was a terrible, horrible, awful, travesty of a  thing.

This wasn't The Hobbit; it wasn't about the Hobbit. Bilbo was literally in only a handful of scenes. He was a prop. He was an idiot. He was a numbskull. Bilbo, the hero of the story, reduced to a hanger-on, small rag-tag that dangles at Thorin's heel. Bilbo, the one with the brains and the luck, is reduced to just having dumb luck because everyone else is so abysmally stupid.

Balin says, Hobbits never fail to surprise me. Yeah, same here. Bilbo doesn't fail to surprise me with his stupid actions. Chief among these is his refusal to put the Ring on when it's necessary; this is, plain and simple, outrageous manipulation by PJ. Then. THEN. He takes the Ring off when he's talking to Smaug, and Smaug sees him. And doesn't kill him. Read that over again, slowly, and tell me exactly what the deal is with that. Please.

So, what is this movie about? Honestly, to tell you the truth, I have no idea. There are a big jumble of half-baked plot elements mixed together to make a tangled mess. There are orcs in every other scene; and I'll tell you that I get sick and tired of seeing these hideous morons all the time. So first we had Azog as the Big Bad Boss Monster, and now we ALSO have Bolg his son as another boss monster that no one can kill.
Can this get any more tiresome? The orcs are there so much that they aren't even exciting; they're just sort of  there, predictably, every time that PJ decides that there's too much of a lull in the movie. They are in Mirkwood. They are in Laketown. They are in Dol Guldur. They are right outside of Beorn's place. They spout clich villain lines in stilted orc language that sounds like they're reading off of their script when they speak it.

Then there's Beorn. I just knew that, whatever they got wrong, they would do the Beorn scenes right. I was sure of it, right up until Beorn-in-bear-shape chased them to his own house.  There are so many things wrong with this part of the movie. In the book, it was one of those really memorable, humorous places. We could relax as they wander through enormous fields buzzing with bees, and laugh as Gandalf concocts a plan to procure Beorn's help. The whole fun of that scene is Gandalf sitting down and telling Beorn the story, adding dwarves as he goes along.
Here, they race through the enormous fields without stopping for breath, are chased into Beorn's house by Beorn, and somehow keep this humongous bear out with his own door. He gets a grand total of one scene in human form; and somehow they just get him All. Wrong. Something very modern-Hollywood-angsty about him and his dead kindred.

Can we please, please, please just have ONE character who doesn't have a tragic past, who does something for a motive other than revenge and hatred? JUST ONE? Beorn is supposed to give them shelter because Gandalf told him a good story. Here, he makes it clear that he dislikes dwarves, and he's just helping them because he dislikes orcs more. All nuance of character and plot are gone, replaced by a quick scene so that we can get on to the important stuff. Namely, elves and (surprise, surprise!) orcs.

So let's talk about the elves. It's quite well known that even some of Tolkien's friends hated his elves. Well, I don't mind them in the books. In TLotR movies, it was pretty tiresome after a while how they were obviously PJ's favorite characters, and he was determined to show how hot and awesome and perfect the elves are. Well, all that pales in comparison to how horrible the elves are in this movie.

Thranduil is a deathly pale  kook. I guess that's the word to describe him. I don't think there's really any way that Legolas could have grown up at all decent with a father like that (also, what's up with Thranduil's cheek going all orc on us? I literally thought for a minute that he was Azog in disguise.). Then there's Tauriel. You've got to be joking. Not only do we get Legolas, as 'hot' and 'amazing' and video-gamish as ever, we also get his female counterpart. Or should I say his female copy. Because she's literally a She-Legolas. Neither of them can overtop the other.
She's just there to visually appeal to the fanboys in the crowd and to create an idiotic love triangle. Ahhh, the love triangle. She falls in love with Kili instantaneously, and there is a horrible five minute scene where she stands outside of Kili's prison door and he blabs to her and she blabs in purple prose to him.

Now let's go on to some specific parts. I was looking forward to the spiders in Mirkwood. Even though I was pretty sure it would be like a Shelob's Lair rip-off, I at least hoped for the best. Mirkwood itself, with it's gloom and creepiness and claustrophobia, was something I wanted to see visualized. I wanted to see despair when the forest seems to go on forever, even if the journey through the forest is mostly montaged.
Instead, they get captured by the spiders on the first or second day. Bilbo somehow is able to use his sword while his arms are bound at his sides by spider-web. Then he puts his ring on for a grand total of one minute, in which he does absolutely nothing. Then he takes it off again and obviously forgets about it.
Now, if I were Bilbo and I had a ring that could make me invisible at convenient times, I would definitely be using it quite often (as does Book! Bilbo). Not Movie! Bilbo. He's a dunce who backs up constantly in the face of danger instead of using his ring and his brains to get things done.

Then the elves come sliding down the spider's webs like firemen going to a fire, and they capture the dwarves. Bilbo frees the dwarves and puts them in barrels. WITHOUT LIDS ON THE BARRELS. He then just dumps them in the river, and of course the elves find out in about one minute and start chasing them along the side of the river. They close a gate and the dwarves are trapped, and the only thing that saves them is orcs.
Yep, you read that right. The orcs end up being the ones to free the dwarves, not Bilbo! Then there is a gratuitous, ridiculous, drawn-out battle IN THE WATER between the dwarves in barrels and the orcs.
Can you imagine how difficult it would be to be in huge barrels where the rim is about at arm-pit height, wielding those huge weapons while the water churns and swirls you around? It would be well-nigh impossible, but here they do it with relative ease. Somewhere in the middle of this, Kili (of course!) gets shot by an orc in the leg.

They escape the orcs for a while and meet up with Bard who smuggles them into Laketown. Where is Thorin's bedraggled but kingly entrance into Laketown? Nowhere to be seen. Instead we have random stupid 'backstory' for Bard, who ends up being like a hero to the people. Elections! Facepalm. This isn't about Bard. This isn't about the Master. It's supposed to be about a Hobbit, who in this movie just sort of goes along for the ride and doesn't do too much. Now Bard has three children and a dead wife. Yeah, nice way to round him out as a character. NOT. He's just supposed to be a guardsman. Not someone who the Master's secret police are watching all the time.
I guess now would be the time to mention the sets. First of all, the Elvenking's fortress is basically just Lothlorien 2, without the music. What's the deal with making the elves (both in The Hobbit and TLotR) creepy and dark? They're supposed to be beautiful and wise (for the most part) but here they're just nasty, scheming people who apparently spend the bulk of their time in beauty salons. And, as another reviewer noted, obviously no one in Middle Earth has invented handrails yet.
Then there's Laketown, which is supposed to be a bustling, prosperous city. Instead, we get a dark, crowded town where everyone is dirty and unattractive (talk about going from one extreme to another!) and downtrodden and oppressed and annoying. I despised Laketown. I despised the Master, and not because he was a mean-spirited guy but just because he and his disgusting little sneak were Too. Annoying. For words.
Oh, and lovely. We get to see the dwarves climbing out of a toilet. That just adds to the whole depressing atmosphere. That atmosphere that isn't supposed to be there.
I wanted to see them welcomed by the people; I wanted to see the Master pretending to believe them just to make the people happy; I wanted to see the people singing songs about the Mountain King's Return. Instead, the dwarves are in a huge rush because Durin's Day is about two days away, even though in the book they don't even know when Durin's Day is and they are able to get there in plenty of time. Also, all this fuss about Durin's Day and they don't even get it right. Because Durin's Day is when the sun and the last moon of autumn are in the sky TOGETHER. But Thorin and Co. are too stupid to realize this. It takes the hobbit to figure it out, and makes him look brainy in comparison to his fools-for-companions.
So, let's go on to Smaug the Dragon. I've gotta hand it to whoever animated him: he looks amazing, and the way he moves is really very good. He's lithe and snake-like and awe-inspiring. Awe-inspiring, that is, until we realize that he's nothing more than an overgrown lizard who only spouts flame when it doesn't do any good.
I love how Bilbo takes about fifteen minutes before he actually puts on the Ring, and then he takes it off after a minute and lets Smaug see him. Smaug sees him and carries on a lengthy conversation with him that lacks all the charm and wit of the book scene. Instead, we get Bilbo sliding around trying to get the Arkenstone, saying things (a few lines from the book) to distract Smaug and buy time.
And then. THEN. Comes one of the greatest travesties of the movie. Thorin and Co. come down to find out if Bilbo is OK, and end up in one of the most ridiculous chase scenes ever filmed. Here's this massive (when I say massive, I MEAN massive) dragon that can fly and spout flames at will. And yet he spouts flame that, even when they hit the dwarves, don't do any damage, and he crawls around threateningly and chases them through the halls. Then he conveniently lights the forgefires for the dwarves. Then, after being covered in molten gold, he roars off to take revenge on Laketown. Bilbo is an idiot yet again and tries to confront Smaug and dissuade him from doing that, and Smaug is an idiot yet again and doesn't kill Bilbo.
On another note, after I saw 'An Unexpected Journey', I said that Gandalf would be a total idiot to send the dwarves and hobbit through Mirkwood alone, knowing what he knows about it now. Yet he allows Galadriel to boss him around (What? She's just an elf, he's one of the Maiar!) and he goes off to Dol Guldur where he does some magic and fights (surprise, surprise!) orcs and even gets into a tussle with Sauron. He also meets birdy-doo-doo-haired Radagast again and tells him to take Galadriel a message even though he and Galadriel can communicate telepathically. The result? He's locked up in a cage by Sauron. Good going Galadriel!

Oh yes. Back to Tauriel, our intrepid heroine. She defies Thranduil, and Legolas goes with her, to 'Save Kili!' They get into Laketown right about the time that Bard is imprisoned and Bard's children are about to be massacred by the orcs. How convenient. They do a lot of fighting, Tauriel heals Kili, and Kili deliriously tells her that he loves her. Wow. How touching. How moving. How utterly BORING.

Legolas rides off after Boss Monster the Second because Boss Monster the Second made Legolas' nose bleed. For the first time ever, Legolas actually gets hurt. After being in a huge fight, in which he was nearly crushed to death, all that happens is that his pretty little nose bleeds? While not a hair is out of place? Not a smear to be seen in his makeup? Right. On we go then. I'm trying (trying!) to be comprehensive here. Bear with me.
The dialogue in this movie (as in 'An Unexpected Journey') was abysmal. Not one of the characters can speak without being either portentous and epic, or syrupy and 'poetic'. They use all the same old tired things that we've heard a hundred thousand fantasy characters say a hundred thousand times.
The costumes. For the dwarves, we get massive and bulky. How in the world do they travel all those miles clad in those ridiculous furs and armor and boots? The elves are just  elves, I guess. Elvish clothing and all that. Everyone in Laketown wears dirty, ragged clothing (even the Master), yet somehow Bard's daughter is completely fresh-faced and blemish-free, as if she has the time and money to do her makeup every morning. Radagast: disgusting as usual.
The music was overwhelming in its epicness. Tired in its repeats of LotR themes.
The dwarves don't work at all in this movie. In the book, they work because we don't have to get to know each of them individually. We see them through Bilbo's eyes. Though he is hired by them, they are secondary characters while Bilbo is the main character. Here, we are overwhelmed by thirteen ugly, crude, stupid characters. There are way too many of them to get to know each of them, and I don't care to really know them anyways. Bilbo is the secondary character here, mostly used as accidental deus-ex-machina.
And in conclusion, I know that this is just a movie. That it's not the end of the world. That it doesn't really have any significance, positive or negative, to anyone's existence. But yet, perhaps it does. Because The Hobbit is one of those few childrens' books that is a true classic: well written, engaging, with a lot of subtle humor, smart dialogue, and a solid plot. It's one of those books that's actually worth something. Taking a book like that, and turning it into a movie like this, is evidence of pure greed and stupidity. A childrens' book that an adult can enjoy, made into a movie that only those who like quantity over quality will like and that probably no one will ever watch a second time, is highly insulting. Perhaps it shows how pathetic most of the viewing public is, that this movie has an average of 4 stars instead of 1 star.
Also, please don't insult me by saying that the added stuff in this movie is taken from the appendices, and that if I was familiar with the appendices I would know that THIS STUFF REALLY HAPPENED. Uh, no. No it's not. Tauriel isn't in there. Azog might be in there, but not chasing the dwarves around. Why? Because he's DEAD. That's why. Killed by Dain of the Iron Hills. Everything is mixed up and twisted and changed until it's completely unrecognizable.

4636441,4,B0059XTU3G,"I know that many people are split on the first Hobbit film, but I for one really enjoyed it. The Desolation of Smaug suffers from being the middle child and thus having no beginning or end, but it moves at a pretty good pace for being a little on the bloated side. All the acting, sets, music and action are top notch. Some of the FX are hit and miss, but the dragon Smaug is an absolute wonder in both look and sound (voiced by a deep and menacing Benedict Cumberbatch). Martin Freeman remains likeable as Bilbo and the addition of Orlando Bloom (back as Legolas) and Evangeline Lilly as a beautiful Elvish warrior makes for some entertaining fight scenes. It does end on a major cliffhanger as expected, but it felt like it was done to make sure people turn up this time next year for the third and final chapter. I could have easily ended a few minutes later after concluding this part of the story and using the next film to lead into The Lord of the Rings.",1387065600,2,961,4.314917127071824
4636452,3,B0059XTU3G,"I loved the Lord of the Rings movies, but I really don't know what's happening with these Hobbit prequels. There's a lot of action for the teenage boys crowd, but the story is getting even more convoluted. Here are my initial thoughts:

GOOD

Some of the action scenes are entertaining. They tend to go on too long, but there are some gems. I particularly liked the ending battle. Even though it wasn't based on the book, there was some interesting symbolism and plot points in that fight.

The set designs, landscapes, etc. are all gorgeous, as expected with Weta. Oh, and Peter Jackson did right by Smaug. I never thought I'd see a dragon emote so effectively on screen.

Martin Freeman is brilliant as Bilbo. His ability to convey ambiguous emotions non-verbally, through a single look or subtle body language, is incredible. Despite my disappointment with the Hobbit films generally, Freeman's has really become favorite depiction of Bilbo.

BAD

The action scenes go on way too long, again repeating a problem from the first Hobbit movie. At the theater, people were just laughing at some of the ridiculousness of the scenes (sometimes there were genuinely funny moments, but too often people were ""laughing at"" the film).

I thought the rest of the dwarves got lost in this movie. Bombur has a ridiculous action scene. Kili gets some moments that are, well, interesting. The rest of the dwarves, even Thorin and Bofur, fall to the background. Gandalf is in the movie, but most of his scenes are action scenes. We very rarely actually see him interact with other characters, which is really a shame because Ian McKellan is so good at setting emotional moods for scenes.

Ironically, the material from the book is shortchanged in favor of more non-book material. Beorn's house is a short sequence and we only see Beorn briefly. The dwarves are imprisoned in Wood Elves' realm for about 5 minutes, and most of that time is spent with Tauriel. The dwarves wait outside the secret door on Erebor for about a minute before almost giving up. There's little sense of time actually passing.

By contrast, we get lengthy action scenes with Legolas and Tauriel. I don't mind Tauriel as a character, but her scenes felt totally unnecessary and contrived. In fact, much of the additional material felt unnecessary to the central story and I kept wanting to return to the dwarves and their quest. Likewise, the Gandalf scenes in Dol Guldur seem like they contradict parts of the Lord of the Rings films.

OVERALL

Overall, this movie is worth seeing if only for the visual imagery. Peter Jackson actually does the scenes that have roots the book quite well, though the problem is that those scenes are a minority of this film. I could see this actually being a great film if only Jackson had edited it more rigorously and cut a lot of the extraneous material.",1387065600,14,2851,4.797959183673469
4636453,3,B0059XTU3G,"I saw the second Hobbit movie on opening night and enjoyed it just about as much as I enjoyed the first installment.  It's a good movie, unquestionably well directed and well performed.  But to me, it suffers the same problem the first installment did and the same problem that I had with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  That is the movie is too long for its own good, and unnecessarily so.

Now, I have no issue with long movies.  Some of my favorite movies have reached three hours or more (e.g. ""Casino,"" ""The Godfather Part II""), but in those cases, the length was necessary to fully tell the story that needed to be told.

With ""The Hobbit,"" this is not the case.  One scene I will point to specifically is the barrel-riding sequence.  This sequence lasted somewhere around twenty minutes, most of which is spent fighting.  The sequence could have easily accomplished the same goal in half of its time.  The additional time provided no additional exposition, it didn't add to the story or advance the plot.  It simply extended the runtime. And no doubt the now requisite extended addition will make this scene even longer.

There's an old rule in writing: don't use a ten-dollar word when a five-dollar word will do.  The same goes for film.  Don't take twenty minutes to show us what can be shown in ten.

While the time spent with Smaug was also quite long, at least most of these scenes served to advance the plot and move the story forward.  But there were instances even here where things dragged on just too long.  After Smaug survived everything that the Dwarves fought him with, it was pretty obvious they were not going to kill him this time around.  Adding more and more attempts again just unnecessarily extended the runtime of the film.

Is ""The Hobbit"" worth seeing?  Sure, absolutely.  There are even parts where you can get up to refill your popcorn and pop and return to the theater without missing anything in the movie at all.",1387065600,8,1951,4.613372093023256

I am not even one who (and I am almost embarrassed to say this...) read the books. Sorry!!! ha ha!! One day I will, I promise! About 20 years ago, I DID read the The Silmarillion...and did't like it!! I don't think I should have started with that one!! ha ha!!  When The Fellowship of the Ring came out, I didn't go see it...but fell in love with the film on DVD. (You better believe I went to see the next 2!) Then was happy to hear the Hobbit was being made into films.

Anyway, I thought The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was very different. Songs!? And lots of slower-moving parts. I liked it, but worried that they were almost going to ""pad"" this trilogy to turn one movie into three. Then I saw this!! It seems to have the opposite problem (which I don't really see as a ""problem."") It packs lots and lots into the film. Lots of characters (who we are finally getting to know...I like that.) Lots of subplots and lots of visuals. It is ALL movie in that 2 hours and 41 minutes!! I didn't even finish my popcorn because I was so busy watching! That is always a good sign for me...if the popcorn goes fast, I know I am bored. Not this time! It was so packed full of stuff that I almost am wishing for the extended version so I have more time to digest it all.

And the dragon Smaug...I admit I was worried after the teaser in the first movie. I thought, ""it is going to be stupid"" or ""it is going to be like Shrek-y or Godzilla-y or too dark/evil or something."" I was wrong. I was.... awed. I really was. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Martin Freeman (who I really like) is a wonderful Bilbo. He seemed to really capture the nuance of the character. Scared, brave, tentative but tenacious, understanding and conveying the whole greed theme...just a sublime performance. I liked him much more in this film than the last one (which I didn't DISlike.) I wish I could thank him...it could so easily been under- or over- played. Same with Ian McKellen. But we all know he was and always will be the perfect Gandalf.

I am not going to give any spoilers away, but this DOES end in a cliffhanger. When I heard the theme music before the credits even appeared, I thought ""NOOOOOO!!!!!!! Don't pull an Empire Strikes Back-ending on me!!!!"" ha ha!! But they did. I would have totally sat there another hour.  I would have!! And I know it is sort of a no-no in the film industry to have such a non-resolution...even when we know a sequel is coming. But somehow it works. They KNOW we are in this for the whole ride...we aren't getting off the roller coaster at the top of the hill after 5 films and many many invested hours.

And what wonderful hours they have been!! Peter Jackson, Tolkien, and the actors and crew have shown me a world I did not know. Characters I care for brought to life right in front of me. The time in my life that I have given the series has rewarded me with something that I will never forget. I go on vacations that don't leave me with as many memories!

This film proves Jackson could have easily made this story into two films and it been excellent. Instead, we see where he desperately tried to cash in on his Middle Earth cred for the money he's not pulling in anywhere else.

When you have a movie about a dragon that takes you almost two hours to finally get to the dragon, you know you're wasting people's time. Many of the scenes in this film would have easily been deleted scenes you see as extras in a DVD. They are scenes that are fun to view if you're a fan, but you can easily see where they could have been skipped and not stopped the story at all.

And lurking in the background throughout the whole thing, you see Bilbo, and remember briefly that he's supposed to be the star of this thing. Fortunately for us, Jackson is forced to finish the film in the next installment so we won't be subjected to more desperate scrambling for footage to pad out another film. And I hope this time out Jackson releases a ""Director's Cut Condensed Edition"" where we just see the film on one DVD rather than this plodding mess so far.",1387065600,19,1404,4.3143939393939394

Superb acting, amazing effects, hot dwarves,(Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin, is one of the best actors of all time, and the hottest guy of our time, in my humble opinion) and a terrific storyline, what more do you want?

4636458,5,B0059XTU3G,"I LOVED the movie! I also loved last year's ""An Unexpected Journey"", but ""Smaug"" is past introducing all the characters and gets right into the action. It also feels more what I think a lot of people expected the first time -- darker, more mature. There's no cute kid stuff this time around. Yes, I know ""The Hobbit"" is a kids book, and I liked the singing and humor in the first movie. Peter Jackson said in an interview a couple years back that the tone would start out happy/golden and then gradually get darker as the films went along. This second chapter feels like we're beginning to get a bridge to ""The Lord of the Rings"".

""Smaug"" does stray from the book more than any other movie in the series so far, and that's going to divide some people. But for me, it was the good kind of change. With three movies and nine hours to work with, characters are able to get a bit more development. The world is fleshed out more. Some short passages from the book are made into epic action sequences. And the dragon Smaug gets a ton more screentime.

Was it absolutely necessary to make some of these diversions? No. Could the movie have been done in half the time if all this stuff was left out? Sure. None of it is NEEDED to tell the story, but here's the thing: it kicks butt. It makes for a richer, fuller movie. I was really worried about the new female character, Tauriel (played by Evangeline Lilly), they were adding and the invented love story. I thought it would be cheesy. But Tauriel ended up being a totally kick butt character whose action scenes rival Legolas. Neither her nor Legolas needed to be in the movie, but it's awesome that they are. And the love subplot between Tauriel (an elf) and Kili the dwarf is so-far platonic and more reminiscent of Gimli's love for Galadriel in ""Fellowship of the Ring"". It adds a bit of heart to the story, and it's another step in bringing the two races together again. And *book spoilers* considering what happens to Kili later in the book, why not give him some character development? This is exactly what Jackson was talking about when he said he split the story into three films so he could give each of the dwarves their own arcs instead of Kili just being ""the one who starts the campfires"" like in the book.

Another change from the book is we actually get to see where Gandalf went off to for half the story. This was all in Tolkien's ""Unfinished Tales"", posthumously published by his son Christopher Tolkien, which included unpublished drafts and deleted chapters from Tolkien's writings. One of the deleted chapters from ""Lord of the Rings"" had Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo, and everyone sitting down one day before Aragorn's coronation while Gandalf explains what he was up to in ""The Hobbit"" when he went away and connects the dots between ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"". None of this invented by Peter Jackson. So it's great to actually see it. Furthermore, in the third ""Hobbit"" movie we will get to see all the wizards kicking butt as they try to drive the Necromancer out of Dol Guldur. Christopher Lee himself confirmed that we will get to see Saruman (probably played by a stunt double) fight! ""[..] it is called 'There and back again' and in that film which will come out December next year and I hope I'm around to see that. There's a lot of me in it. A lot! Trememdous amout of fighting, swordplay, understanding, sympathy, kindness towards Galadriel, towards Gandalf and I'm not saying anymore because that would... give the story away. But it's the third film in which I have the most to do and I've done it. I just hope I'll see it. I know you will. You'll see this one [..]""

Smaug is incredible! Benedict Cumberpatch (who stars alongside Martin Freeman in PBS' excellent ""Sherlock"") not only voices the dragon but actually slithered around in a motion capture suit! It will be amazing to (hopefully) see the behind-the-scenes footage of this on the eventual extended edition blu ray. Smaug is the GREATEST film dragon I've ever seen! I've waited all my life to see him fully realized in a live-action movie and he did not disappoint. He's on par with Gollum and the Balrog in terms of design and CGI, but really it's Cumberpatch's performance that makes it something you have to see.

Like I said in my review last year of ""An Unexpected Journey"", the cinematography just keeps getting better with each movie. I think the ""Hobbit"" trilogy so far looks even better than ""Lord of the Rings"", and that's saying A LOT!

There is so much to rave about... The barrel sequence is the best action sequence of the year... The spiders scene is another favorite scene. As someone who is afraid of spiders, Shelob in ""Return of the King"" didn't really creep me out, though I loved the design. The spiders in ""Smaug"" really creeped me out the way they looked and moved! And it was just a great sequence altogether.

Every year these movies feel like a Christmas present. I got the same feeling I got last year that I was watching one of the best movies I've ever seen. Could it have all been done in one three-hour movie? Yes. But I'm so glad that we're getting more.",1386979200,7,5129,4.544372294372295
4636459,1,B0059XTU3G,"Sorry! But I've lost my patience! Watching The Hobbit was quite demoralizing! Unfortunately, The Hobbit has been turned into a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! There is ZERO justification for turning the Hobbit into a trilogy, if you are going to drag out the story and do such a poor job. The Tolkien family - who I assume controls the rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's works - should be ashamed of themselves. They could have insisted in putting the story first instead of letting director Jackson create such a vapid and mediocre second Hobbit film. It's really quite sad! How can a director who made 3 masterpieces out of Lord of the Rings stoop so low and turn The Hobbit into something so trite and empty that, at times, it's like watching a Saturday morning breakfast cereal commercial on T.V.?

I badly wanted to like this movie. At least the first movie of The Hobbit trilogy had some interesting moments despite its many flaws. But now the Hobbit has been turned into a cartoon with mostly boring two-dimensional, cardboard characters. The acting was so poor at times it ruined the illusion. But worst of all, there's very little heart, unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is the epitome of passion and adventure and good storytelling.

I also think part of the problem is that director Jackson is trying to turn The Hobbit into another The Lord of the Rings, which is quite stupid. They are very different stories. From what I have read, Tolkien wrote The Hobbit  essentially for fun and wasn't even going to have it published until his friend, the great writer, C. S. Lewis convinced him otherwise. The Tolkien family should have went with a different director. Since when does one man own a storytelling giant like Tolkien?

Then I was forced to watch this awful movie in 3D or drive elsewhere. I noticed about 30 seconds of special 3D affects. How can that be called a 3D movie? I call it a rip-off and I wish the Federal government would call such a claim fraud, so filmmakers would think twice about ripping off the public!

Hollywood pulled the same stretching-out-the-story-stunt  with Harry Potter, but at least I was smart enough to never have watched the last film. I eventually became so disgusted, I could care less what happened to Harry Potter. The same storytelling destruction non-sense has now captured the Hobbit. When I started hoping that Smaug would snap Bilbo Baggins and the King of the Dwarfs in a half, I realized I'm now done with all things Hobbit movie related!!",1386979200,45,2519,4.752860411899314
4636460,1,B0059XTU3G,"I think Peter Jackson must've read the book when he was a little boy and then made this movie based on his memory of the book. Then he found out that the movie was going to be too short with the current script that he wrote from his memory, so he added a whole bunch of things to fill in the gaps. This is butchery, nothing like the books. I really don't even want to waste my time writing a long review. It's nothing like the books. Hardly any dialogue from the book. This is not the hobbit. This is Peter Jackson silly little idea of what it should be like. this will never be classic movie. It will be virtually forgotten after a year or two. The dimwitted goblins are not supposed to chase them throughout the entire story. They just have the goblin so there will be some action and keep people interested. If it weren't for the goblins chasing them every two minutes, everyone would have fallen asleep in the theaters. So to end my rant, and to recap the movie, goblins chased the dwarfs throughout the entire movie. There is a stupid she elf that the Tolkien never even dreamed of. There is a pathetic romance between the elf and one of the dwarfs. Smaug is a retard who refuses to kill the dwarves and Bilbo when they are right in front of him (and the dwarves are not even supposed to talk to smaug, which they continuously do in this movie). Bilbo is a retard who refuses to use his ring when he is supposed to.
Now I think I'm going to go sit in a corner and weep and howl about what they have done to this book, this glorious book that Tolkien wrote. And the really sad thing is that I loved the Lord of the rings movies, and now PJ has done this.",1386979200,36,1658,4.168224299065421
4636461,1,B0059XTU3G,"I never really understood how Star Wars fans felt after Gorge Lucas butchered the prequels and left fans all over the world writhing in agony. Its not that I liked the prequels, I don't, they really are garbage. But to me, as much as I liked Star Wars, they were always just movies. Fantastic movies, yes, but just movies. They held no significance to me, I felt no emotional attachment to them, and they most certainly didn't change my life and help turn me into the person I am today. So when Gorge Lucas made three terrible movies and took a giant steaming dump all over a franchise millions of people love, I didn't feel the same sense of betrayal and hopelessness they all felt because, well, Star Wars was never anything special to me.

The Lord of the Rings now, well, thats different. I still remember the sense of joy, wonder, and awe I felt sitting in the very front row of a sold out theater watching The Fellowship of the Ring, and hoping beyond hope that it would never end. Id never read a book in my life before then, but upon stepping out of that theater I devoured JRR Tolkiens masterpiece in a matter of weeks. To say that The Lord of the Rings has affected my life more than any other work of fiction, both the movies and the books, would be a gross understatement. Those films caused my love of reading, which in turn caused my love of writing. All the reviews Ive posted on Amazon over the years, are because of The Lord of the Rings. The hundreds of books Ive read, are because of The Lord of the Rings. All the stories Ive written, the worlds Ive begun to imagine, everything Ive ever created is all thanks to Peter Jackson, JRR Tolkien, and The Lord of the Rings. I don't just love those films and books as great works of fiction; I love them as works of art which have inspired me to try to emulate them. So believe me when I say that The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure to see in my entire life, that it is not something I say lightly. This isn't just me bashing on a bad movie, its me venting my frustration as a franchise I hold so near and dear to me is tarnished before my eyes. There wasn't a single part of this three hour bore fest which I enjoyed. Not one. Youd think in a three hour movie thered be at least one part I found to be interesting, one part I thought was fun or enjoyable, or at the very least not completely and utterly terrible. But you would be wrong. Oh lord, you would be SO wrong. From the 45 minute barrel fight, to the ninja Orcs sneaking up on Elves (of all things), to the hour and a half of Dwarves bumbling around in a cave while the most incompetent dragon ever created chases after them, there was nothing in this film that even comes close to reliving the greatness of the original trilogy.

The problems with this movie would be too many to list here, but I will try to go over what I saw as the most damning of them. First of all, and I think we all kind of suspected this going in, the pacing in this film is just awful. The movie is three hours long, three hours to cover maybe a hundred pages worth of source material, if that. But heres the really confounding thing about it, there are parts where this movie almost felt rushed. Can you imagine that? Youd think, with three hours to fill in with worthless filler and almost no source material to draw from, they would take their time with all parts of the story. Nope. Mirkwood, one of my favorite moments in the books, is rushed through like its an afterthought with hardly any time devoted to it at all. Weve hardly even entered the forests before were rushed through it so fan girls can all swoon over a noticeably older looking Legolas and his new kinda but not really love interest, a she elf named ahh, who cares. It really is a shame the spiders of Mirkwood aren't given more special treatment. I had envisioned in my mind a grand opening sequence where wed dive into the lore of The Lord of the Rings and be introduced to Ungoliant, the mother of all spiders, and Morgoth the original Dark Lord, so we could be shown how the great spiders and Smaug himself came into being. How grand would that have been? But no, we get a silly conversation between Thorin and Gandalf, and the spiders are an afterthought. Because giant spiders attacking our Fellowship isn't what Lord of the Rings fans want to see, noooo, what we want to see is Legolas running around for 45 minutes chasing barrels and she elf flirting with a dwarf. Yeah, that was totally worth making the spiders an afterthought.

But the biggest gripe I have is all the worthless nonsense Peter Jackson shoe horned into this movie for NO OTHER REASON than to pad out a movie that really should have been no more than an hour, maybe an hour and a half long. The She Elf, the 45 minutes of barrel riding, all that extra nonsense at Lake Town that has no business being there, the hour and a half of Dwarves stumbling around in caves, the ninja Orcs, all the this and the that, and the that and the this is stupid, pointless, goofy. Its a mine Its filler people, plain and simple. None of this HAD to be in the movie, and none of it justifies splitting a 300 page book into three, three hour movies. If you take out all the filler, all the fluff, all the stupid nonsense and spam Jackson forces into these films, you MIGHT have enough for two feature length films. Not two three hour films, but two normal length films. Maybe one three hour film if thats the road you want to take, but not three.

And no, I didn't think the action was fun or exiting. I thought it was goofy. Really, really, REALLY goofy. The original trilogy had its share of WTF moments, esp with Legolas towards the end, but even so they always had a sense of dignity, and respect for the source material. The action was fun and exciting, as opposed to drawn out and goofy. There was normally one or two crazy action moments in the original trilogy per movie, such as Legolas shield surfing down a set of stairs at Helms Deep, but nothing nearly as nutty as this. It has to be seen to believed. Fun? No. Riveting? No. Exciting? No. Goofy beyond all reason? Why yes, yes it is. This isn't a Lord of the Rings movie, is a parody of a Lord of the Rings movie.

But this review wouldnt be complete without talking about Smaug himself, the title character and main antagonist to this story. Is he at least cool? Well, yes and no. Smaug certainly looks cool, one of the best dragons Ive seen in film. Personally I prefer the look of the dragons in Game of Thrones but Smaug is an awesome looking dragon. Hes also really cool sounding with an amazing voice actor doing his vocals. So whats the problem? Well, hes kind of an idiot. Near the end of this movie Thorin and company end up leading Smaug on an hour and a half wild goose chase through Smaugs own home, a home most of these Dwarves have never even seen before, and he just cant get them. He even has one dangling on the tip of his nose at one point and he still cant kill the stupid guy. Smaug is a dragon that laid low one of the greatest dwarf kingdoms to ever exist in a single day. Hes a dragon that burned down the greatest city of man in the entire north as an afterthought. Sure hes been slumbering and getting fat for the last thirty or so years, but you mean to tell me that he couldn't kill a single Dwarf. Now I know what you're thinking, that he doesnt kill any of them in the book (as if a movie that strays from the source material so much could possibly use that argument), but you forget that entire chase scene wasn't in the book either. Bilbo just stole something and Smaug got pissed and went to burn something to settle his nerves. Thats it. That whole stumbling and bumbling around in the dark Three Stooges style, that was all Jackson. So while I will admit that Smaug both looked and sounded awesome, he is entirely incompetent and, therefore, isn't scary.

I could go on and on about this movie, but I think Ill just leave it at this. Peter Jackson was handed a golden opportunity to bring JRR Tolkiens The Hobbit to life on the big screen, and instead decided to take a big fat steaming dump on it. Shame on you Mr. Gorge I mean Peter Jackson!!!",1386979200,73,8230,4.28598971722365
4636462,3,B0059XTU3G,"Just got back from the theater. Before I begin pontificating, let me preface with this: yes, I am a Tolkien purist. I love the books better than the movies and I can actually explain exactly how Frodo, Bilbo, Pippin and Merry are related, without looking it up. So this review is from a student of Middle-Earth, and definitely not mainstream.

CINEMATOGRAPHY: (no spoilers)

The pacing between action and dialogue is well done. The build up to the dragon is very tense and exciting, and as we see two new cultures in this movie (Silvan Elves and Lake Men), a lot of credit needs to go to the extras and ""small actors"" who make these places feel real. The fight sequences are unreal, especially between Orcs and Elves, but very cool. I didn't get to see it in 3D, but I can tell that it would be so worth it, because a lot of the shots are meant to have the viewer shying away from an arrow or an ax, or a shower of dirt. And then, of course, the dragon himself is spectacular. Every moment Smaug is onscreen, you can't help but tense up, waiting for the next inferno breath. He's massive, he's jewel-encrusted and he has a style of movement something between a cat and a snake. Just perfect.

CHARACTERS: (small spoilers)

Thorin's character grows darker and we see a bit of the ""gold sickness"" that infected Thror, to which Richard Armitage gives just the right amount of unbalance. Bilbo has, as the trailer shows, found his courage, but also struggles with desire for the Ring, like an echo (or rather precursor) to Frodo. Kudos to Martin Freeman for this delicate portrayal of the hobbit thrust into a world of dragons and gold, trying to be the only voice of sanity. We also are treated to a lot of charcter expos from the dwarves (dwarrow, to those of us in the know), which is a lot of fun. Bofur, Fili, Kili, Dwalin, Nori and Bombur in particular get to show us who they are. Legolas is back, and although I liked seeing him in his home, I felt that incontrast to his father, he came off as not quite so regal. Nevertheless, he is still the Elf who hates Dwarves and strives for honor. His dad, on the other hand, is elegant and kingly, but with a hinted passion for jewels. His selfish, ""less wise and more dangerous"" personality contrasts rightly with Galadriel and Elrond. Gandalf is still scruffy, still brave, and just a tad other-worldly. Perfect performance by Ian McKellen; this is the Grey Wizard just as he was in LotR. Radagast... Is still eating mushrooms and rooming with birds - honestly, an embarrasment to the Tolkien original. And Azog the Terrifying introduces his son, Bolg, who is just as gut-wrenchingly ugly and cruel. Spot on with the book; although Bolg does not get any personal description in Tolkien's works, if I pictured the most warped, twisted evil Orc to lead an army from the Grey Mountains, this is what he would be. Bard, however, stole the spotlight for me. As a dad, and as a ""freedom fighter"" in the heavily regulated town of Esgaroth, he is more than what I pictured. His pessimism and realism are balanced by a hinted belief in the old stories. Bard is pulled right from the pages of the book.

TAURIEL: (some spoilers)

I had to give this character her own space. Okay, yes, she's cool. She probably sets new records for speed killing Orcs every week. She balances that with an almost High Elven interest in the world around her and a care for others. No, she's not a Tolkien creation, but that's not my issue; I think she's a very good portrayal of what the Elves in the background feel like from the books. But yes, she's just in there for sex appeal. Sorry; that's the truth! Take it from a girl - you do not need a girl in every story, just because they are girls. That actually trivializes us more than an all-male cast. Evangeline Lily acts well, and her lines are good. I just really did not need her to add tension between Legolas and Thranduil, or the super awkward Legolas-Tauriel-Kili love triangle. I think if they had simply made her someone who inspires Legolas to fight, or even made her his love interest free of tension, then I really would not have minded. But the drama just killed this character for me.

POSITIVES: (no spoilers)

It has a great cast, awesome CGI, stunning sets and backgrounds and that unnamable quality in the air that is Middle Earth. The costumes, the lines, the hold-your-breath action and most centrally, Smaug, are incredibly enjoyable.

NEGATIVES: (some spoilers)

This is NOT the Hobbit. It just isn't. The beloved child's book has been transformed into an improbable action with a side of romance tension movie. So much has been changed in the plot that I can't make a short list of what I don't like. But you know it's bad when this section is where Beorn belongs. He literally gets five minutes of screen time, and I'm relieved when it's over because he's just a werebear. Move along, people; nothing majestic or curious to see here! But my main complaint is this: the dark feel of LotR somehow made it's way into this light-hearted tale and took over.

CONCLUSION:

I like this movie. A lot. But before you go to see it, erase the book from your mind. Then you can enjoy it. Do not try to compare it with the book, because it will just break your hobbit heart.",1386979200,15,5259,4.530031612223393
4636463,4,B0059XTU3G,"I was a little disappointed by the first Hobbit installment in the 3-part trilogy. Too much of the beginning was used to reintroduce us to residents of The Shire. Yes, it grew on me after repeat viewings. But it could have been better. I was even afraid Peter Jackson was starting to lose his touch.

Fast forward to opening day of Desolation of Smaug, and all of my fears have been laid to rest. I caught this flick at the earliest time slot that the theater chain near my crib offered, which was in the A.M. The theater was about 1/3 full of other dorks who probably lied to their bosses and took a sick day just to catch this movie. No, there was nobody camping out in tents, TFG.

The opening scene: Peter Jackson steps out of a doorway into the pouring rain and takes a big chomp out of a carrot. This has to be one of my favorite cameos I've seen by a director in quite some time. It reminds me of some of the surprise appearances by Stephen King in his lesser known book-to-film adaptations. Either way, Peter Jackson assures his audience that this trilogy is a work of art that he is proud to put his personal stamp on.

The entire movie is very action-packed and leaves minimal chance for the gross innuendo that tainted some of the other Jackson-directed Tolkien films. Again, I could do without the Metrosexual make-up wearing Elves. The fact that these sissies could do any damage whatsoever is a mystery to me. Legolas and crew look more at home plucking their eyebrows and waxing their butts than fighting any real battles. Lucky for us, many do get picked off by the ugliest Orcs Jackson has unveiled onscreen thus far.

Smaug gets an incredible amount of screen time and makes this sequel awesome. The creature effects were sorta cartoony, but balanced by Benedict Cumberbatch's incredible voice work. I'm not sure how exciting the 3rd will be as it may just end up being a battle movie like Return of the King. All-in-all, I left the theater knowing that my movie ticket was a good investment.",1386979200,3,2010,4.513736263736264
4636464,5,B0059XTU3G,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug follows the return of Gandalf the Grey as he encourages Thorin Oakenshield to go on a certain mission that reconnects him to Bilbo and a strong group of dwarves. There is a certain artifact that Thorin must obtain (with assistance from others) in order to solidify the actuality of him becoming king. The main challenge is that this special item is also located in the abode of a magical and dangerous dragon.  I would have to admit that my favorite actor portrayals from this film are Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, and Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. This is because Lilly plays a powerful and skilled warrior who shows compassion for others and uses her gift in battle both fairly and to help others. Armitage does the tough challenge of making the best decisions while carefully considering the lives of those in his charge while Freeman crafts a superb depiction of someone taking certain actions for the greater good of others while refining his own journey.  However, there is also talented acting from other actors in this film that are going to appeal to many men and women who enjoy fantasy type films such as this. I must avoid saying too much more out of consideration for those who have yet to see this movie. However,  I feel guided to at least say that further information on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug can be found on thehobbitdotcom website and features the return of Ian Mckellen and the inclusion of actors such as Orlando Bloom, Stephen Fry,  Benedict Cumberbatch, and  Lee Pace.",1386979200,3,1583,4.805147058823529
4636465,5,B0059XTU3G,"This is the best film of 2013.

The story moves along at a much faster pace than An Unexpected Journey, the action scenes are more interesting, the visuals are spectacular as always, all in all: FANTASTIC.

I was a little disappointed with last year's An Unexpected Journey because of it's length and the way it drags out.  Yes, The Desolation of Smaug is just as long but because of the quicker paced story line, the movie flies by.

I would not recommend this movie for people under 10 years of age because it is quite violent.

All in all, The Desolation of Smaug is a huge improvement on An Unexpected Journey.  In my opinion, it is on par with The Lord of The Rings and it is absolutely the best movie of 2013.",1386979200,4,715,4.338345864661654
4636466,4,B0059XTU3G,"The Hobbit is a tough film to review, mainly because it hasn't finished yet. It's not actually 3 movies, it's 1 movie split up into 3 parts, 3 LONG! parts as many fans/critics continue to complain about. Personally i have to agree, The Hobbit would likely have been better as a shorter 2 part movie rather than an overstretched 3 part, however, the length of this and the first part of the movie do not really bother me, i have enjoyed almost every moment of this adventure so far, but the cliffhanger this second chapter ends on is a bit aggravating, reminding us that we have to wait another year for the end of the movie. What once started as a simple children's book has now been re-imagined on a somewhat grander scale, for better or worst. What might bother some people or the die hard fans of the book besides the expanded narrative are how some characters were handled, specifically Beorn who honestly felt underdeveloped and also didn't get that much screen time, it puzzles me why Jackson didn't just stick to how Beorn was introduced in the book. Despite these issues Peter Jackson has still managed to craft an exciting action adventure full of wild special effects, humor, and one hell of a cool dragon. If you can look past the changes/additions to the Hobbit's story you are sure to find that The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a great 1/3 of a movie.",1386892800,13,1370,4.550607287449393
4636467,5,B0059XTU3G,"WOW! The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug is a fire breathing earth shattering awesome movie viewing experience. In spite of being a fairly long movie when the end came I was like ""that's it"". This movie is action packed it just flies by. The whole is fantastic but the highlight is of course the Smaug stuff. Smaug was a thrill a second when his part came. Even Smaug's talking is awesomely terrifying. In addition being action packed The Hobbit The Desolation had Smaug had GREAT special effects and visuals. The acting was also superb,espically in the role of Bilbo and the voicing of Smaug. My only complaint is that this movie didn't seem to have an ending. But it was so awesome that it can only be a 5 star movie.",1386892800,,718,4.488549618320611
4636468,4,B0059XTU3G,"THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG opens this weekend, and it is fantastic! Having been underwhelmed by the childishly whimsical, seemingly never-ending THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, I wasn't sure Peter Jackson's latest Middle-Earth adventure would be much better. Guess what? It was immensely entertaining, feeling closer to the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. For obvious financial reasons, Jackson has stretched one book into three movies. This film, however, is much less tedious in pacing. Bilbo and the dwarfs continue their quest, destined to lead to a confrontation with the dragon Smaug, voiced by golden-piped Benedict Cumberbatch. Smaug is the best-looking dragon ever to grace the big screen, so kudos to the effects team. Speaking of effects, Bilbo & company also encounter a forest full of giant spiders, which makes for an intense action/horror sequence. Hot in pursuit, are scarier, less cartoonish (thankfully!) orcs, more closely resembling the beasts we see in LOTR. Jackson knows how beloved his LOTR trilogy and characters are, so he inserts a completely new story arc, featuring Orlando Bloom's Legolas (who wasn't even in this book), and his potential elfin love interest, Tauriel, played sexy/tough by LOST's Evangeline Lilly. She's a total bad-ass, and a bit of a troublemaker. Jackson is trying to build a bridge between THE HOBBIT and LORD OF THE RINGS, adding more hints that darkness is brewing, with war on the horizon. I've never read any of Tolkien's books, so I can only speak from the perspective of being a huge fan of the LOTR motion picture trilogy. While I think there's still too much reliance on cgi, Jackson is taking his version of THE HOBBIT in the right direction. I truly loved this movie! PG-13 for lots of decapitations! Yay!",1386892800,3,1773,5.117241379310345
4636469,3,B0059XTU3G,"Well, another one under the belt, I suppose. Things I liked: the use of the landscape, the sets, most of the visuals. Things I disliked: the characterisations, the story-line, most of the dialogue (if not out of the book). Interesting: the dragon. Boring: the constant fighting. So, pretty much what I expected from a PJ movie. What's starting to annoy me is his predictableness: always go for the obvious, never resist a bad joke.

The 3D high frame rate, which I experienced for the first time, is a stunner. I actually swatted at one of the bees in Beorn's house (it came directly at me!).

All in all these are beautiful, but shallow movies and I really, really yearn for someone to do Tolkien right.",1386892800,14,704,4.624
4636470,1,B0059XTU3G,"Wow, how does this have good reviews?  Non-stop irritating action, absurd story lines, unending slash and crash fights, very little continuity, strange character deveolopment, and, did not follow Tolkien's work.  I will admit a few of the visuals were good, and a few of the actors, you know who.... were wonderful, but even they can't carry the whole movie.  I liked the first Hobbit, and loved the Rings Movies, but this has no substance to back up its length (nearly 3 hours of selling 3d tickets and large sodas I guess).  If you are 'read' fan of Tolkien you'll hate this movie.  Especially what they did to Beorn's character...just an angry out of control wolverine basically, no joy, no intelligence or depth.  In short, if you love all action badly written at a ridiculous speed then enjoy.",1386892800,50,798,4.788321167883212
4636471,3,B0059XTU3G,"First thing you should know is that the movie is somewhat different than the book. We have Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) as a fresh face heading the Elven guards. Legolas (Orlando Bloom) makes a comeback (I just love this guy); and we have a stand-off between Gandalf and the Necromancer.

WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE PLOT:
None of these folks & events were present in the Tolkien's version of The Hobbit that he had written primarily for children. However, from a movie standpoint, where visual elements are more relevant; these factors add very well to the story.

WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR:
The action pieces are smoothly coordinated and extremely well executed. As an action buff, I found the fight between the Elves and the Orcs an absolute pleasure with Tauriel & Legolas using their bows with lightning quick efficiency to decimate the Orcs. This action that takes place midway through the film is one of best orchestrated in all five Tolkein movies so far.

THE NOT SO GOOD:
Having said that the story is slow at times, and the budding romance between Tauriel and Kili seems stiff and construed. At 2 and half hours, its a long story. And the closing fight with Smaug was a bit stretched.

The ending is a cliffhanger. I was like, 'Wait a minute. The movie ended?'... and then realized that of course this is a trilogy the story doesn't end here. The foreboding words ""I am Death!"" will echo in your ears as you leave the movie hall.

WHO SHOULD WATCH IT?
Ideal for those who like to immerse them in the Tolkein world either as a fan of LOTR movies or the book. You will have trouble following the story if you haven't seen the first part of The Hobbit.

BOTTOMLINE:
As with all middle movies in a trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug joins the first and third movie, and at times suffers from being the in-between between two installments. The good thing is that the action is better choreographed than the first one, and the return of Legolas brings a welcome mix. Go for the breath-taking action & the magnificence of its fantasy; and be patient during its lean moments. You will enjoy it.",1386806400,11,2082,4.598382749326146
