1410365,5,B00005A1SV,"When I watch BlackAdder I, I say this is the Best of the BA series.  Then I watch BlackAdder II, and I say this is the Best of the BA series!
So I once again say, this is the best of the BA series!  And I REALLY mean that!  I think III is just a cut above the rest, because not only is Rowan Atkinson at his best, Hugh Laurie as the Prince Regent is an equal match so you have the two of them pushing each other.
In Dish and Dishonesty - Edmund see his chance to make the move from Prince's Butler to a MP by staging the elections.  The episode is sidesplitting.
Ink and Incapability - Edmund wants to become a writer, but runs afoul of the first English dictionary
Nob and Nobility - The French are revolting - no they ARE really revolting and it sets the Stage for of lot of master of disguises
Sense and Senility - The Prince regent becomes enthralled of acting and pulls the whole household into it, having Edmund to recruit two actors to be the Prince's coach.
Aim and Amiability - the Prince Regent has over spent again, so Edmund must play matchmaker to find the prince a rich bride, only both sides are hiding things
Duel and Duality - The Price makes a mistake of romancing the Duke of Wellington's daughter and now it's 20 paces at dawn...unless Edmund can think of something to stop it.
Baldrick is back and Edmund's dogsbody and manage to steal the scenes!  Look out for the Turnip!",1073260800,20,1394,4.245283018867925
1410366,5,B00005A1SV,"As very much not a fan of Rowan Atkinson, I am always surprised how incredibly hilarious this series is. Black Adder III, however, is the cream of the crop for only one reason: Hugh Laurie. The man is a genius; I can say no more, watch an episode and see. From squirrel-hating transvestites to a puerile adolescent Prime Minister, there's something strangely believable about the absurdities in this Black Adder. And for anyone who knows English history and literature, there are tons of little jokes that you can will enjoy understanding when no one else does.",1063324800,,561,4.854166666666667
1410367,5,B00005A1SV,"One of the funniest things I have ever seen on the screen.  Taking place in a more recent historical context and having been a history major helped me ""get"" some of the jokes that only those in the UK might have appreciated in the earlier series'.  Much better than Blackadder 1 and the equal of Blackadder II in that Rowan Atkinson's wit is honed to a razor sharp edge throughout all the episodes.  I leant this to a friend of mine and she literally threw up laughing.  It's too bad most American still think British humor ended with Monty Python and quote it ad nauseum when Blackadder lurks in the corridors.
""Look behind you, Mr. Caesar!!!""",1033948800,6,644,4.525862068965517
1410368,4,B00005A1SV,"I have only seen episodes from this and the first Black Adder series.  I must say that I think this is much funnier and more light-hearted than the first series.  The first series (1983) does have it's moments but suffers from unfunny serious moments and an ultimately unlikeable and annoyingly voiced Black Adder (Rowan Atkinson).  It does grow on you though, especially if you love British humor.  You may want to own the entire series; if not for the consistent laughs, then for the originality.  Anyway, this, the third series (1987), set in England (1768-1815) finds Edmund Black Adder as the butler of George, the Prince Regent.  Baldrick again plays servant to Black Adder.  This series, like the other three, consists of 6 episodes.  The episodes you get here are ""Dish & Dishonesty"", ""Ink and Incapability"", ""Nob & Nobility"", ""Sense & Senility"", ""Amy & Amiability"", and ""Duel & Duality"".  DVD is the best way to own this collection (but you already knew that, right?).  The set of 4 DVDs can be bought individually or as part of a 5 DVD set including a special, ""Black Adder: Back & Forth"" (aired in 2000), interviews, and other goodies.  I am not sure if ""Black Adder's Christmas Carol"" (1987) is included on this DVD, but it is in the boxed set.  One of my favorite episodes in this volume is ""Ink & Incapability"" where the Prince decides to ""partonize"" Dr. Johnson's dictionary, which took him 10 years to complete.  Baldrick accidentally uses it as kindling and Black Adder feels he must try to rewrite it all in one night.  One of the best aspects of this series is the witty dialogue.  This is from the aforementioned episode:
Black Adder: ""Baldrick, believe me, eternity in the company of Beezlebub and all his instruments of death will be a picnic compared to five minutes with me - and this pencil...""",996019200,8,1819,4.73015873015873
1410369,5,B00005A1SV,"Black Adder stars Rowan Atkinson, an absolute comic genius who is also the star of Mr. Bean.  The screenplays were written by Richard Curtis (Mr. Bean, Not the nine o'clock news) and Ben Elton - possibly one of the funniest modern writers.
In the third series, Rowan Atkinson plays a bitter, frustrated butler to the stupidest man in England - which is saying a lot since Baldrick is still around.
The six episodes in the series are:
1. Dish and Dishonesty - Edmund proves that politicians don't have to rely on issues when the lone voter can tragically cut his head off while shaving
2. Ink and Incapability - Black Adder is forced to re author the first English dictionary over the week end to avoid being skewered by a man whose sword is as mighty as his pen
3. Nob and Nobility - the French revolution is on and Mrs Miggins is busy serving suspiciously shaped sausages
4. Sense and Senility - the Prince Regent decides to be an actor, but Edmund pulls the curtain on his plans
5. Aim and Amiability - in order to keep his master, and thereby himself, in the lifestyle to which they have been born, Black Adder tries to secure his boorish boss a new, wealthy bride.
6. Duel and Duality - after a brief tryst with the Duke of Wellington's daughters, the prince regent may have finally gone too far
Series II and III are definitely the best of Black Adder.  The others are funny, but these truly shine",988070400,31,1402,4.45136186770428
1410370,5,B00005A1SV,"Black Adder the Third was probably the series peak. The last series was good but this is so perfect that it is a hard act to follow. Edmund Blackadder is the butler of George, the thick Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie). Balrick is back as Blackadder's dogsbody and has hit the depths of filth but not stupidity (though he's pretty darn stupid). All six episodes are great with my personal favourite being the first episode about the by-election. Stephen Fry guests as the Duke of Wellington, Miranda Richardson in a dual role, Nigel Planer and Tim Mcinnerny as the Scarlet Pimpernel, Chris Barrie as a Revolutionary. Mrs Miggins, previously only mentioned finally appears as a regular played by KYTV's Helen Atkinson Wood.  This really is worth it!!! This gets my lowest rating, 10 thumbs up",984182400,5,786,4.865671641791045

1410438,4,B00005A1SV,"This DVD contains the third installment of the Blackadder comedy series, ""Blackadder the Third."" The six episodes were originally broadcast on the BBC in the fall of 1987.  Rowan Atkinson again stars as Edmund Blackadder--this iteration of the series is set in the late eighteenth century, and sees Blackadder as the butler for the Prince of Wales.

As in the second season of the show, Blackadder is competent but frequently sarcastic, and this comedy again finds him in several difficult situations.  Subjects of the period that are touched on include Samuel Johnson, the French Revolution, parliamentary politics, rotten boroughs, the theater, highway robbery, and duels.  Modern-day BBC election coverage is even spoofed in one episode.

Season Three also contains many laugh-out-loud moments, and provides many painless moments of instruction in history for younger viewers.  Those who enjoyed the first two installments of ""Blackadder"" will like this one as well.",1404172800,,969,5.469798657718121

It's sharp wit comes quick and the jokes are hard hitting. I absolutely love this and can't go an episode without laughing obnoxiously at least once, if not several times.

The plots are devilishly clever and liberally sprinkled with double entendres, yet well this side of silly, making wonderful use of such co-stars as Miranda Richardson in II, with a guest in III, and Hugh Laurie in III.  And the ensemble cast are among the finest ever assembled by a BBC series (which says an awful lot).

I can't say enough good things about this series. It certainly rates with Fawlty Towers and the Yes Minister shows for sheer entertainment. One characteristic it shares with Towers is that they made far, far too few of them.",1364515200,,722,4.677165354330708

to the feeble-minded Prince of Wales (a terrifically funny Hugh
Laurie), the son of the mad King George III.

This is the funniest of all the series, with Laurie's contribution
pushing the show up to a higher level.

There are still a few dull spots, and not every episode is brilliant,
but this does somehow combine almost Monty Python/Fawlty Towers type
genius into a period sit-com.

Atkinson as Blackadder continues to evolve, less dashing and handsome
here than in series 2, but more enjoyably (and understandably) angry
and frustrated at his situation in life, serving a man with a tiny

1410479,5,B00005A1SV,"Blackadder is a British comedy that follows the lives of the royal ""Blackadder"" line, a lineage that seems to produce nothing but sniveling cowards who are always trying to shirk duty and avoid all sense of obligation. Produced in four seasons, with each season taking place at a specific time in history, the series commences in season one with the life of Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), a son of the English King (Brian Blessed) in the 15th century. As the seasons progress, we move forward in time until ultimately arriving in season four with a certain ""Captain Blackadder"" in the trenches in World War I. The premise of the show, then, is to watch the machinations of the current Blackadder as he squirms his way through each threatening situation while continuing his quest to wiggle ever higher up in life, whether that be to become King (as in season one) or to escape the trenches of World War I (as in season four). The show is one of the most successful comedies to ever come out of the BBC.

The character of Edmund Blackadder begins in season one as the Duke of Edinburgh (his accidental killing of Richard III over the misappropriation of a horse seems to cause him some serious difficulties about this time, with a little help from Shakespeare), and episodes revolve around Blackadder either attempting to seize control of the throne or, in the other cases, trying to keep from being executed due to his shenanigans. Without giving any of the story lines away, we can say that each season sees Blackadder incarnated in the form of one of the descendants of the Blackadder line, and so Edmund's character shows up, first in the Middle Ages, then in the Renaissance, and finally, in World War I. Over this span of some 600 years (specifically, 1485 - 1917), we see that for one to be a ""Blackadder"" carries a whole series of connotations with it, this being the underlying theme of the show in all its contorted situations and events.

Edmund Blackadder is not the only recurring character throughout the seasons. His dogsbody is Baldrick (Tony Robinson), who is also present in every episode in the entire series. Other actors (including Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, and Tim McInnerny) who appear as key characters in one season will frequently appear as different characters other seasons. Each of the supporting actors is outstanding, and although Blackadder is clearly Atkinson's show, all the actors work together to pull the effort off seamlessly. Many of the special characters are famous British actors and/or comedians, but it is not necessary to know that as you watch the episodes.

To a certain extent, ""Blackadder"" defies categorization as a TV show. It certainly is a comedy, and a sardonic, cynical one at that. However, the series is so vested in British history that one almost feels you are receiving a series of lessons on British history rather than just watching a comedy show. And while it is not necessary to be fully aware of the major events of British history in order to enjoy the show, it certainly helps to bring a richer enjoyment to the experience, and you also won't miss the numerous history-oriented ""asides,"" ""caricatures,"" and allusions that fill the show. The other side of the coin, so to speak, is that by watching the entire series, you can get a ""mini"" British history lesson on an almost subconscious level.

The show is indeed extremely funny, but this is a distinctively ""British"" show. If you are an American viewer and are not familiar with this type of humor, there may be a short period of adjustment, but after one or two episodes, understanding the humor becomes second-nature. True, there is much similarity in Rowan Atkinson's style of humor and the type of humor commonly seen in America, but there is certainly also that little added ""twist"" that may take typical American viewers a little time to absorb. Once you do, it is straight laughs all the way. And it is not all high-brow: there are sight gags, physical humor, and yes, even occasional crassness. This is history for people who don't take history all too seriously, and Blackadder in a way epitomizes all that we average people feel as we go through life, regardless of the historical backdrop operating during our lives.

Some viewers may be aware of Atkinson's other very famous and popular series, ""Mr. Bean."" Let's be clear and explain that there is virtually no relationship between these two shows, which have different premises, a different comedic approach, and are generally aimed at different audiences. To think that Rowan Atkinson successfully completed an engineering degree at Oxford and ended up playing Edmund Blackadder is a stretch, at best. And yet, once you see him in action, you can easily see how this came about. He is like a little kid in class, always wishing to pull the string on the person's clothes sitting next to him, or perhaps placing the proverbial whoopee cushion under the teacher's chair. In a very real way, it all seems a natural, un-acted role for him.

Blackadder season four was voted in 2000 by the British Film Institute as the 16th best British TV series in all the BBC's history. The previous three seasons are every bit as good, and it is likely that the strong political themes underpinning season four played into the rating. Let's just say that, in spite of its occasional crudity and offensiveness (yes, we may be offended at a few things here and there - the show is an equal opportunity lancet), Blackadder must be easily rated as one of the BBC's master productions. It's fun to watch, helps us learn, and perhaps even more, makes us think. But it is simply sheer comedic entertainment that begs for another season. Purchase all the seasons together in this single, remastered set. It will save you a few pounds from buying them one season at a time!",1325808000,,5834,4.805776892430279
1410480,5,B00005A1SV,"This is the third Black Adder series. I liked it better than the second series and about the same as the first series - although the first and third are very different in several ways.

In this third series, Black Adder is the butler for the Prince Regent circa 1800 Britain. The Prince is kind of an idiot and gets on Black Adder's nerves. Baldrick is back in this series as some sort of servant. Percy does not return, but the guy who played him did appear in one episode in this series.

There are some wild episodes. The getup and parts of the two actors in one episode for example, being well, almost creepy, but still funny. I guess this third series is more sedate than the two previous, but still funny.

I look forward to series 4.",1293753600,,740,4.309352517985611

1410482,5,B00005A1SV,"Atkinson before Bean and Laurie before House.  All of the BlackAdder seasons are great, but III is the best because it shows the hapless butler at his most frantic and most irritated.

Atkinson is brilliant in his portrayal of Edmund Blackadder, the frustrated and snippy butler to Hugh's moronic Prince Regent.  In each episode Atkinson's frustration reaches new heights as he tries to deal with the infuriating situation of being supremely more intelligent than his superior (Laurie as the prince).

Dish and Dishonesty is probably my favorite as Blackadder takes political corruption to hilarious extremes.  But there is not a weak link in the bunch - the entire disk is fantastic.

Even if you've never seen a Blackadder feel free to start with III.  It won't take too long to figure out the premise, and it will take even less time to burst into laughter - especially if the site of man with a huge turnip shoved in his mouth is funny to you.",1241568000,,947,4.737804878048781

If you are going to watch Black Adder, I would suggest starting with the first one but it's not necessary. Each season is complete and you don't need to know what happened previously to enjoy any of them. I have the whole set and am ecstatic!",1232928000,,489,4.50561797752809
1410484,5,B00005A1SV,"Black Adder has now moved into one of the eras I love the most - the early 1800s, the days of Jane Austen and Pride & Prejudice. Edmund Blackadder is now a helper of the Prince Regent, played hilariously by Hugh Laurie of House fame. Watching Rowan Atkinson interact with Hugh Laurie is just priceless, never mind having Baldrick in the mix too adding his own commentary.

Sense & Senility is probably my favorite of this mix, with the overly self-loving pair of actors who come into the world. Rowan torments them incessantly by saying ""MacBeth"" which is a superstitious jinx to actors. The others are great as well, from the Scarlet Pimpernel style activities to the dueling at dawn.

There are just so many tiny moments in these show that make them special. The way Rowan rolls his eyes at Hugh, the way Baldrick is blissfully unaware of how he has just destroyed Rowan's life (yet again).

Highly recommended!",1230336000,,913,4.69375
1410485,5,B00005A1SV,"In the late '80s I happened upon a copy of 3 episodes of Blackadder III in a public library and took a chance.  Fate was smiling on me that day as I was introduced to a new world of comedy.  While many of these actors seemed familiar to me, I had not known their genius until that day.

Now Hugh Laurie and Rowan Atkinson are household names, but then, they were a British sensation that hadn't quite yet hit our shores.  The supporting cast was no less amazing.

Edmund Blackadder of the 18th century is the best realized incarnation of our antihero.  He schemes for power not just for the usual banal selfishness, but because fate has reversed roles in a most cruel way: from son of Richard the Lionheart, his dynasty has been reduced to manservant for the foppish, idiotic, ineffective prince regent George (while his father is off to marry a rose bush).  He is the only intelligent being surrounded by a maddening bevy of squirrel-brained turnip fetishists.  While he is characteristically self-serving, he is positively humble compared to Lord Wellington, Dr. Johnson, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley and other delightful caricatures from British history.  Viewers end up rooting for him despite themselves.

If you want to introduce yourself to the world of Blackadder, this is my recommendation for where to start.",1220918400,,1315,4.856502242152466

Black Adder turns history upside down on its head. Forget whatever you learnt of the Tudors because you will have to re-learn it when you watch the ""real history"" of Black Adder.

For those who are unfamiliar with this series, it may take you a while to understand the nuances and ""read between the lines"". But this ability to understand the humor will increase as you watch the series. A general underlying truth is that each episode gets funnier as you move forward in this series.

Blackadder is more cunning and sarcastic than ever and Hugh Laurie is brilliant as the idiotic Prince Regent. So many great lines throughout. It's just hysterical. I can't say much more. Added bonus on this dvd is the inclusion of Blackadder's Christmas Carol, another hilarious episode. Whereas some of the recent Blackadder specials have been dismal, this one was filmed just after series 3 when the writers were at the peak of their powers. Set in Victorian times, the twist here is that Blackadder's descendant has become kind and caring but after being visited by the Christmas ghosts, he becomes the Blackadder we know and love. My favourite line is the put down of his screeching niece ""I don't expect you to understand blessed as you are with a head that is emptier than a hermit's address book"" and telling Baldrick the only way he's going to get a wet kiss at Christmas is to make a pass at a water closet.

1410499,5,B00005A1SV,"Is EASILY the funniest run of the BA series! Atkinson's handling of the role as a resentful, scheming butler serving an idiotic Prince regent and dealing with all the vain, odd characters of 18th century England is a wonder to behold! The episodes come off like well done period comedy plays, perhaps written by the likes of Jonathan Swift or Washington Irving. There is definitely a very theatrical look and ""feel"" to the episodes, and I am put in mind of the field trips to Princeton's McCarter Theatre back in the 60s, where we saw ""Faust"", ""Uncle Vanya"" and ""Candida"". B-II had some of this feel as well, but in B-III, for some reason, it is more pronounced.

""Sense & Senility"" is probably the funniest ep. here, with Edmund hiring two actors that have caught the fancy of the dim Prince, played by Hugh Laurie. The actors are the very soul and image of foolish, rococo vanity and pomposity, with over-rouged cheeks and reddened lips, ridiculous powdered wigs and the manners of rich old dowagers. Edmund teases them by endelssly repeating the name of the play ""Macbeth"", which is anathema to the superstitious, foppish men. A series of events seals their doom as they lead Baldrick to believe that they are plotting to kill him and the Prince. Edmund, who hates them, has them wrapped up as traitors.

Another great ep. is ""Amy & Amiability"", in  which a financially overextended Prince has to marry wealth to be solvent again. Miranda Richardson joins the cast again for this episode as the apparently sweet and innocent intended young lady, who holds an incredible secret. A few scenes involving squirrels and the girl's overprotective father will have you on the floor laughing.

""Nob & Nobility"" is probably the weakest ep. here as Edmund and Baldrick get involved with the French Revolution and the Scarlet Pimpernel. ""Red Dwarf's"" Chris Barrie and B-II and IV's Tim McInnerny make guest appearances in this one, but it doesn't help a fairly gagless story that has a lot of people faking VERY bad French accents.

The rest of the episodes are excellent and make this arc stand out as the high watermark for the series, edging out B-II only by a HAIR...
