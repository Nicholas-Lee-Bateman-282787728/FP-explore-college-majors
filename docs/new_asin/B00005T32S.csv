1658714,5,B00005T32S,"Yuyu Hakusho is the best anime in the world this review is for the entire series not just for this volume, the series starts weird, but it gets really good, if you like a lot of action and fighting and super powers you should get all the volumes that come out (about 26 Volumes), I've seen all the series in japonese with english legend, I've liked it so much i am going to buy the english dubbed dvds.",1018656000,,402,4.166666666666667
7953262,5,B00005T32S,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

Yusuke has his first case. He has to hunt down 3 demons that have stolen supernatural treasures that could cause trouble for the living, and spirit worlds. He surprisingly gains some unexpected, and unwilling allies after this case.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1460,4.301818181818182
7953263,4,B00005T32S,"To quote Monty Python: ""Yusuke's not quite dead! He's getting better!""

And ""Yu Yu Hakusho Volume 2: Artifacts of Darkness"" has a lot going on in a mere four episodes -- it has to bring our punky anti-hero back to life, reset everything for more action and supernatural thrills, and introduce the rest of the main cast. It's actually done fairly gracefully, although the character of Hiei is pretty unrecognizable compared to his later appearances.

Yusuke has won back the right to live once more. But the only way is for someone he knows to kiss him at a certain time, with permanent death as the alternative... meaning he might have to resort to getting smooched by Kuwabara. And his return is conditional -- now he's working for Koenma as Spirit Detective, a sort of supernatural cop with a ""spirit gun"" in his fingertip.

And his first case is a nasty one: three powerful artifacts have been stolen from Koenma by a demon trio, including the mysterious red-haired youth Kurama and the ruthless three-eyed demon Hiei. Yusuke has a rough enough time defeating the ultrastrong demon Goki, but the case turns out to be more complex than he expected when he learns Kurama's complicated motives for stealing his artifact -- and that Hiei has a nasty fate in store for Keiko.

After a rather bland string of opening episodes, ""Yu Yu Hakusho Volume 2: Artifacts of Darkness"" is where the series really blasts off. Once Yusuke's back in his body and a newly appointed Spirit Detective, suddenly the storyline gains a lot more potential -- there are apparently little nasty demons crawling around the town (taking Kuwabara's cat hostage) and big strong ones plundering Spirit World.

Most importantly, this volume also introduces two vital characters who later become regulars: the elegant fox-demon-turned-demi-human Kurama, whose love for his mother leads him to desperate actions, and the brutal three-eyed Hiei. Hiei comes across as rather 2-D and inexplicably spends a lot of time taunting Yusuke for no reason, but Kurama is a very striking guy, especially since he establishes early on that he used to be very different both in body and mind.

And though the first episode is a bit slow, these stories are peppered with some fun comic relief (""DON'T YOU THINK YUSUKE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THAT!?"") and some clever action scenes, such as Yusuke finally figuring out a way to defeat the thuggish Goki and elusive Hiei. But there are also some sweet moments (Kurama's reunion with his mother) and a bit of romance between Yusuke and his semi-almost-girlfriend Keiko.

""Yu Yu Hakusho, Volume 2: Artifacts of Darkness"" is when the series really takes off, and it provides some intriguing new characters as well. A bit slow at first, but it starts improving once the hero stops being dead.",1241568000,,2781,4.904255319148936

7953265,5,B00005T32S,"I really liked this DVD but I sort of prefered the uncut version over this one.  Yusuke first meets Hieh and Kurama.  Apparantly there are three theives in this DvD. Hieh, kurama, and Gouki. Kurama leaves the three for a very sad cause.  It almost made me weep.  (sniff sniff. crying for five hours) just kidding.  It is very sad though, about Kurama trying to use one of the three artifacts he and the other two theives stole from Koenma just so he couldsave his mom.  Hieh and Gouki on the other hand are just down right peices of crap who don't care for anyone but themselves.  This DvD is excting and fun to watch.  No cliffhangers in the end of the dvd.",1106438400,,658,4.2926829268292686
7953266,5,B00005T32S,"I love Yu Yu Hakusho, and these are some of my favorite episodes  They are where Yusuke finally wakes up after a lot of preparation, and meets Kurama (dreamy sigh) and Hiei.  This is a MAJOR episode if you want to learn more about Kurama, and if you miss it, you'll probably regret it throughout the whole series.

  This series is originally REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD (NOTE: Reviewer is a Yu Yu Hakusho fanatic), and the DVD is good quality :D.  You'll especially like it if you are a Kurama fangirl (that's me) or Hiei fangirl :D.",1098748800,,546,4.4646464646464645
7953267,5,B00005T32S,"Alive and well, Yusuke now has some new tricks and adventures waiting for him in this next installment of the series. Also, two more characters are introduced. The soft-spoken Kurama and swift swordsman Hiei.",1052784000,,208,5.147058823529412
7953268,5,B00005T32S,"^_^  Yup I love it! Totally worth the money. I love Kurama and Hiei but I love them even more as a couple. If your a yaoi fangirl like me you will really see the love between these two. Quotes:
Hiei: 0_0  You really have gone insane!
Kurama: A strategist is someone who uses their brain. (talk to Yusuke)
Really good one ^_^",1045353600,,324,4.126984126984127
7953269,5,B00005T32S,"Ok You have to admit this is very good anime. It's so well planned out on all the fighting plots. So it has some romance stuff. But it's for us girls or guys that like that kind of thing. Well these next episodes show alot more action and a little back ground on some characters. Mostly Kurama my favorite character. I love his hair and his eyes.
 This is about three artifacts that was stolen by three demons that wish to use them for for their own reasons. For good or bad you will have to watch to see who use's these artifacts for there own selfish reasons. Yusuke has retrieve these artifacts back with in a week before the king returns home from his vacation, or Koenma will be punish as well as the world if those artifacts are not returned to there rightful place. Yusuke must find and defeat these demons all in one week and try not to die doing so.
 Well I can tell you this, these next episodes are very surprising. You may feel sorry for some of the characters. Yusuke will be a joker till the end. This is something I think everyone will like. It's for all people girls, guys, and all anime lovers. It's funny, exiting, action pack, great story lines, great plots, emotions of romance, this just has it all. I love this anime very much. I hope you get it. I promise you, that you will not be disappointed.
 YU YU HAKUSHO IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN AWHILE. AS EVERYONE THOUGHT DRAGONBALL Z IS GREAT. BUT YU YU HAKUSHO IS WAY BETTER, CAUSE IT IS SO PLANNED OUT AND EVERYTHING HAS A TWIST. A+++++++++++++++ FOR YU YU HAKUSHO.

7953270,4,B00005T32S,"The first episode on this tape is the best, followed by the last episode. I just love it. Then Kurama and Hiei are finally introduced, much to the delight of the many fans. (I'm personally a Kuwabara fan, so I didn't find the rest of the tape as entertaining as others may have, but I know I'm biased ^_^). Go Yusuke and Kurama! I see my first hint at Kurama's cunning here.",1032393600,,374,4.208333333333333
