2054168,5,B00021LGPK,"The Dark is one of those sci-fi/action/thriller movies that is big on talent(William Devane, Richard Jaeckel) and not much else. There is a murderer on the loose in L.A., is it an alien? We don't know! Is it a supernatural monster? We don't know!

  What we do know is somebody or some THING is killing people at night in L.A. and the only one who can stop him is a down and out, alcoholic writer,(Devane, who is also the father of the killer's first victim), who finds out who the killer is from a clairvoyant old woman. The only saving grace about this celluloid turkey,(other than Cathy Lee Crosby as eye candy), is Richard Jaeckel's typical, but nonetheless letter perfect portrayal of the tough cop,(with a great big .357 Magnum) who's gonna get the killer no matter what! This movie is a must have for all Richard Jaeckel fans! Oh, there's also a blind guy who is seen walking at night throughout the movie who doesn't even get so much as a scratch.",1126569600,8,955,4.508670520231214
2054169,5,B00021LGPK,"Here's a film that borrows elements from not one, but two distinct decades of horror: 1950s bug-eyed monster movies, and 1970s supernatural TV horror.

I know no term for that 1970s style of supernatural TV horror, but you know it if you've seen it.  Shows like Ghost Story/Circle of Fear, Kolchak: The Night Stalker,  Night Gallery, The Darkroom.  TV movies like Horror at 37,000 Feet (1972), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973), and The Initiation of Sarah (1978).  Theatrical films like The Evil (1978, aka Cry Demon, House of Evil), Burnt Offerings (1976), and The Sentinel (1977) share some of that sensibility.  Many 1970s supernatural horror productions feature that same canned music; an eerie harpsichord piece and/or a trilling flute noise.

The Dark opens with a long informational scroll across the screen, read by an ominous narrator, informing us of the various deadly ways in which species adapt to life on Earth, speculating that the same likely occurs elsewhere in the universe, and suggesting that not all first encounters with such life forms are likely to be friendly...

This somber silliness evokes those 1950s BEM movies in which some narrator or scientist delivers an overly-long bit of pseudo-science, spoken with the stern seriousness of a high-school biology film strip.  Although, it may also have been inspired by Star Wars's screen scroll, that film released only two years earlier.

The Dark's informational scroll culminates with a red ball of light hurtling toward Earth.  We cut to a young woman exiting a movie theater.  Oddly, it's night and the streets are deserted.  Was she the only patron?  Anyway, she's properly frightened, and scurries up the street.  She hears footsteps.  Spooky voices whisper...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

She quickens, runs, ducks, thinks she's safe...  An alien monster rips off her head!  (No, you don't see it.  Despite the alien's MO, you only see one decapitation in the entire film.  This film isn't too gory.)  Anyway, thus begins...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

I say ""Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!"" because whenever it's dark and lonely, and some character is wandering about, that eerie (and eerily familiar) canned 1970s music is mixed with non-diagetic spooky voices whispering...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

Such non-diagetic whispering makes no sense.  This is not a supernatural film.  No spirits or ghosts.  Just a gypsy fortune teller with some clairvoyance.  It seems the whisperings were added solely to create atmosphere, and frighten us with...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

And to assure we're scared, characters oblige us by wandering about dark deserted hallways, parking lots, streets, nervously glancing about, sometimes killed, sometimes not.  Yet despite the title, this is not a film about the dark, but about a killer alien.

While the atmospheric style is 1970s, the monster story is 1950s, with a shamelessly cheesy alien.  Its hands resemble Lon Chaney's werewolf, hairy with long dark fingernails.  It hurriedly stumbles after our heroes in what appears to be (in silhouette) Frankenstein monster boots.  Its red cat-like eyes shoot raygun beams that toss people across a room before causing them to explode without a trace.

That's the atmosphere and monster.  Here are the characters and story:

The dead woman was the daughter of horror novelist Roy Warner (William Devane).  Devane has made a career out of playing clean-cut authority figures, but here he is scruffy and long-haired, as befits a horror novelist.  Naturally, Roy Warner has also done prison for manslaughter, his novels are ""nothing but blood and gore,"" and he lives in a pricey Hollywood Hills house.

Hey, aren't ALL horror novelists fabulously rich felons who only write blood and gore?  (As The Dark was released in 1979, I assume the ""rich"" part was modeled on someone's idea of Stephen King.)

Roy Warner is one of The Dark's more original characters, as the film is a parade of stereotypes.  We have two cops assigned to catch the killer.  One's a clean-cut straight-arrow (Richard Jaeckel), the other's a pudgy slob (Biff Elliot) forever dripping donut filling.  This allows for the usual comic relief, as when Jaeckel tells Elliot to ""buy a bib.""

Hey, that's funny stuff.

(Okay, let's not judge too harshly.  The critically acclaimed Hill Street Blues was still recycling cop/donut jokes years after The Dark.)

The Dark has the usual Police Captain (Warren J. Kemmerling) who gets heat from the mayor, hates the press, and wants to ""keep a tight lid"" on events.  You've met him in many a Kolchak episode.  When one cop suggests the killer is a ""zombie,"" the Captain explodes: ""Zombie!  Mangler!  I don't want to here any of that!""

The Dark also has a bizarre gypsy fortune teller, a midget newspaper vendor (more comic relief), and jive-talking blacks (one of them wearing a puffy denim pimp cap).  Philip Michael Thomas (Miami Vice) has a bit part as an angry young black man.  In fact, the Internet Movie Database credits Thomas as ""Angry Young Black Man.""  This is noteworthy, because the film credits refer to Thomas's character as: ""Corn Rows.""

Well, his hair IS in corn rows.

Cathy Lee Crosby (That's Incredible) plays Zoe, a crusading TV reporter.  And yes, although hired for her looks, she's tired of covering fluff, and wants to do hard news in ""the big league.""

Zoe's supposed to be bright, but she's not very.  At least not as written.  Zoe pontificates that it's ""ironic"" that the daughter of a horror novelist (who trades in gore) was killed in gory fashion.  Warner accuses Zoe of implying that it was ""poetic justice.""  Zoe insists she meant ironic, but that's because she's illiterate.  Irony requires incongruity, so it would have been ironic if Warner's books had promoted peace.

I don't think the screenwriter intended Zoe to be illiterate, but she is.

Zoe's illiteracy also causes her to be self-contradictory.  She accuses detective Jaeckel of not doing enough to find the killer.  Moments later, she switches and accuses him of going too far (""Thirty-two caliber justice?"" she accuses).

One senses the screenwriter was writing cool clichs, unaware when his lines were contradictory.  Zoe is supposed to be smart and idealistic, yet if one listens, she sounds illiterate and ego-driven.  But since Crosby looks good, we're not really listening to her Zoe.

  I've discussed atmosphere, monster, characters.  I haven't gotten to the story yet?  Well, the ""story"" is simple.  What you'd expect.  Characters wander about...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

Occasionally, their heads are ripped off, or shot into nothingness by the alien's red raygun eye beams (I call them eye beams, but sometimes they look more like mini-photon torpedoes).  Curiously, when one jive-talking black guy goes in search of his prostitute, he gets shot with those eye beams and explodes into nothingness.  But later, it's reported that he was decapitated.  Then, when another character burns and disappears into nothingness, the remaining characters marvel that there appears to be nothing left.

As Warner and Zoe repeat to each other: ""Weird.""

Eventually, clues are found and the alien is cornered.  At which point, the heroes run away.  The cops arrive, and there's much shooting of guns and eye beams.  The alien snatches Zoe and, maintaining proper 1950s BEM standards, for the first time in the film he does not instantly kill his victim.  Seems he just wants to hold Zoe, maybe carry her off somewhere.  This gives her time to scream and be rescued.

The Dark was produced by Film Ventures International, a prolific horror film company during the rise of video.  It eventually went bankrupt, the fate of many indie startups.  Much later, The Dark was re-released on video as The Mutilator, making all that whispering of ""Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-ark"" all the more nonsensical.  (Not to be confused with the 1985 slasher film, The Mutilator, aka Fall Break).

The Dark is hardly original or great.  And despite its comic relief or cheesy clichs, it's not intended as parody.  Nor is it unintentionally funny.  But it is fun.

If you like 1950s BEM movies, if you like 1970s TV supernatural thrillers, then you'll enjoy this walk through...

2054171,3,B00021LGPK,"The vast majority of this one is spent listening to detectives talk and not focusing on anything scary. The monster/alien that is attacking people is formidable looking, but doesn't have enough exposure. I understand that the director was going for an elusive creature, one that stayed in the shadows.

2054176,4,B00021LGPK,"This is proof that you shouldn't change horses in mid stream. The movie started life as a slasher movie under the hand of Tobe Hooper as director and American Bandstand host Dick Clark as a producer.  Hooper and Clark clashed and Clark fired him before filming began. 1979 (the year this was made) was the year of Alien and Clark decided to change the plot from slasher to alien flick. Big mistake!  He didn't have the whole script redone and left some huge holes in the plot.
 That said, Clark got some real on screen talent and did manage to turn this mess into fun, but for all the wrong reasons.  I love bad movies and this is one of the worst. I made sure  I bought a copy because I love it if you don't like 70's bad cheese don't buy.",1420243200,,740,4.183098591549296

2054184,3,B00021LGPK,"The movie was simply bad and not even ""best in bad"" type of campy. The movie has a needless 1950's prologue and epilogue. But let's not stop there, how about some 50's soundtrack music. Break out Peter Gunn. William Devane plays a Steven King type of author whose daughter has been brutally murdered by the alien. He tore her head off, although we really don't get to see any blood or gore. The police are baffled in what turns out to be a serial killer known as the Mangler Zombie. Cathy Lee Crosby plays the late night blond TV newscaster, long before FOX required them all to get implants and wear shiny lip gloss. She ends up with William Devane in a lame seduction scene. Oh BTW there is no sex or nudity to go with the no blood and guts. How it got an ""R"" rating, I couldn't tell from the movie.

There is also an elderly woman who plays a Jean Dixon type of person who sees the alien killing in the future of a young wanna-be movie star whose name she doesn't know. She is upset that the inept secular police don't take her seriously.

The alien, we are told, kills to get stronger, although there was no way of telling. We really didn't know why there was one lone alien predator in California. When the alien attacked two things happened first: 1) The lights went out. 2) The alien had his own theme kill whisper music like Jason...daaaark...nessss. Oh and one more thing, the alien had frickin' laser beams shooting out of his eyes.

The movie is borderline camp, which is not where you want to be.",1313107200,,1508,4.359430604982206
2054185,4,B00021LGPK,"I first saw The Dark on late-night television during the 1990s and thought it was an interesting movie, even though it had no great science-fiction effects.  The movie is concerned with an alien stalking and killing one person each night in a southern California city, but the majority of the story is about the characters' interactions as they struggle in trying to stop the killings.  William Devane and Richard Jaeckel are excellent in their respective roles as the father of a murdered girl who is quietly determined to find the killer and the equally-determined but confounded police detective who cannot find a pattern in the murders.  Casey Kasem is surprisingly good as the medical examiner providing analysis of the killings and the killer.  There is a steady mental pulse in the movie that gradually and vigorously builds to the high-energy climax.  The end scene of Jaeckel's character kneeling over his fallen police partner and then looking up to see Devane's character looking with concern at him is emotionally powerful in sadness and the realization that the man whom he had viewed as hounding him about the murders understood and cared about his own loss.  A more defined alien and some science-fiction technology would make this a perfect movie.",1259539200,,1263,5.048076923076923

Mostly the monster at the end looks like some green fat creature from the black lagoon. And as far as the picture on the front of a guy shooting, ""Superman"", like lazer beams goes, its more like a bad light show than the latter. Still a good movie all in all.

2054191,3,B00021LGPK,"I seem to be going through a second childhood again. This movie is another in a line of movies I have bought lately that I remember watching late nights on Fridays in the 70's when C.B.S. ran movies on late night T.V.(before all of these awful talk shows took over the airwaves and the networks were all you had to watch).

  This one started as a slasher/zombie movie(If you can find it read the novelization of the script by Max Franklin I believe) and you can see what they were trying to do with the screenplay.

  The whole movie reeks of pre and post production tampering and I think that's why this is such a mess. Anyway, they changed their minds mid production from slasher/zombie to alien/zombie or slasher/alien/zombie or was it zombie/slasher/alien with laser beam eyes, or was it...............

  See what I mean, anyway this (fill in the blank here) lands and starts blowing people up, only the police say that it's mutilating them(change of the idea but they didn't change the whole script). The first one killed is William Devane's daughter and he wants answers. Cathy Lee Crosby and Richard Jaeckel round out the cast and all look lost and each one seems to have a different draft of the script.

  Yet with all this there is a strange watchability to the madness and when I was 11 this was good. Now it's like the old sneakers you keep even though they look and smell bad and you still wear them from time to time. Most will hate it but if you grew up in the 70's a saw this on late night T.V. you may find a corner of your shelf for this raggedy old sneaker of a movie and watch it now and again.",1175558400,3,1616,4.385906040268456

2054195,4,B00021LGPK,"The concept of the dark or the darkness has played a seriously important role in horror since the first horror story was ever told.  In fact, it's practically almost a character itself.  Numerous horrible things can hide and attack in the dark.  Even the immortal Dio tells us, ""And monsters always know it's better in The Dark!""  Along comes this flick from the 70s called The Dark.  This is the film that attempts to answer what is it in the dark that scares us so much.  What's waiting there in the dark to attack?  Is it a vampire? a madman? an evil spirit or demon?  a slimy Lovecraftian monster?  No, that evil force in the dark is a hairy alien with laserbeam eyes that wants to pull your head off.  He's randomly taking heads on the street at night(long before the Predator did, mind you).  Sometimes he decides to blast them with his laser eyes instead.  Laser victims explode.  I'm not talking about an enormous splat of blood and body parts, but an actual explosion of sparks and a loud bang.  The alien's motives are never explained, making him a real pain in the ass for the police to catch.  Personally I like this lack of an explaination, coz it's more realistic to assume the alien wouldn't tell everyone his plans so that the audience can experience the ""closure"" they always seem to need.  The Dark is pretty much what you would expect of this kind of film, and if you're on this page reading about this film, I'm sure you're a fan of silly horror flicks and  already know something about it.  The alien isn't seen much-either from a distance or in a few short closeups.  He does look kinda creepy, too bad we don't see more of his face.  The film was directed by John ""Bud"" Cardos(his name itself an indicator of the quality of this film) who also brought us the William Shatner classic, Kingdom Of The Spiders.  There's a short interview with ol' ""Bud"" on the disc, and the guy actually seems really cool.

2054197,3,B00021LGPK,"Stumbling upon this obscure little film on the sale shelves was nothing short of surprising. Having only previously possessed the vaguest of memories from my youth regarding this movie's premise, I was immediately compelled to snatch a copy for my collection. Believe me when I say it was money well spent.

Please take into account that I harbor an affectionate place in my heart for stuff like this, and always have. ""The Dark"" will certainly not cater to everybody's tastes, nor should it be approached by those expecting a heart-wrenching character study. This is nothing more than cheesy good old fashioned fun that should, if nothing else, provide the undemanding viewer a swift ninety minutes of harmless diversion. Any film that features a creature from outer space, masquerading as a maurading cadaver, that fires laser-beams from its eyes and decapitates people with its bare hands, is definitely worth something! Catching Cathy Lee Crosby in something so totally outside of ""That's Incredible"" was particularly noteworthy for me, in and of itself.

Media Blasters, in conjunction with the folks at Shriek Show, have managed to package ""The Dark"" quite presentably on DVD. The picture quality, while not entirely perfect, is suitable for the film's overall age. I actually find it rather doubtful that you would ever see a more reasonable transfer anywhere.

From a technological standpoint, I think we can all agree that filmmakers have matured a great deal since ""The Dark"" initially debuted in theaters. I personally feel I've become somewhat jaded in that respect. We have all become spoiled, at least to some degree, with all the new advances in computer wizardry and animation. Every now and then, however, I enjoy harkening back to the fondly remembered days when low-budgeters like ""The Dark"" were commonplace staples of our pop culture. While I can't say this film would win any awards, it honestly doesn't have to. It is what it is. ""Bud"" Cardos made the material his own and left us, his viewers, with a right fine piece of entertainment.

2054198,4,B00021LGPK,"According to director John 'Bud' Cardos, who took over the after the previous director Tobe Hooper was let go shortly after production started, The Dark (1979) was originally supposed to be a story about a psychotic killer, one who, as a small boy, was locked in a dark attic by his parents for nearly his entire life (apparently there was something seriously wrong with the boy), and then was set free after a fire killed his mother and father.  Something happened (what I don't know), and the story was changed as to make the killer an alien (science fiction horror films were in vogue at the time) for better or worse.  Directed by John 'Bud' Cardos (Kingdom of the Spiders, The Day Time Ended), and written by Stanford Whitmore (""The Fugitive"", ""The Wild Wild West"", ""McCloud""), The Dark stars William Devane (Family Plot, Marathon Man), Cathy Lee Crosby (""That's Incredible!""), and veteran actor Richard Jaeckel (The Dirty Dozen, Chisum, Starman).  Also appearing is Keenan Wynn (Piranha, The Clonus Horror), Biff Elliot (The Navy vs. the Night Monsters), Jacquelyn Hyde (House of Terror, Going Ape!), and radio personality Casey Kasem, who's done voice work in a ton of cartoons, but is probably most famous as the voice of Shaggy in the Scooby Doo series.

The movie starts off with a shot of outer space, and some narration about how we're not alone in the universe.  After this, we see an animated fireball heading towards Earth, and shortly after that the fun begins.  Seems some 7 foot tall, messed up alien (looking a lot like a zombie) full of attitude and bad vibes, with the ability to shoot laser beams from his eyeballs, has taken offense to us humans, and has decided to mutilate and decapitate us one by one.  The first victim is the comely daughter of horror writer Steve Dupree (Devane), who used to go by the name Roy Warner, that is until he got arrested for manslaughter some years past and went to jail (he killed the man sleeping with his wife), caught by Detective Dave Mooney (Jaeckel), who just happens to be the lead investigator on Dupree/Warner's daughter's recent death...sound confusing?  It gets better... Cathy Lee Crosby plays Zoe Owens, and up and coming television news reporter who sees the recent spate of killings as a prime opportunity to break into the big time, and ends up eventually becoming involved with Dupree/Warner as his daughter was one of the first victims.  All right, now throw in a slightly creepy, very kooky psychic named DeRenzy (Hyde), who looks a bit like Bette Davis, a goofy comic relief sidekick detective named Bresler (Elliot), who's eating something in every, stinking scene he's in, exploding bodies, a mnage a trois car chase sequence, and dilly of a final sequence and you've got yourself a whole lot of slop that actually works, despite the fact it shouldn't...

In his interview director Cardos, who used to be a stuntman, among other things, states he liked the original story more than the one that ended up being presented, but given he came in after production had already began, I doubt he had much say over the content he was hired to film, and given my past experiences with his films, I have to figure he probably wasn't much interested in making waves, but rather just doing what he was paid to do...the film, which credits Dick Clark as one of the producers, is an odd, often ill-fitting, mixture of genres, but I did enjoy it.  If you don't know any of the back story about this film prior to seeing it, you will develop a sense that something is hinky about it as the forced mating of the two genres results in something of a minor abomination, one that's actually fun to watch.  The pacing does tend to drag in the middle as there's a decent amount of character development featuring essentially three main threads that eventually come together, the first being Devane as father of one of the victims harassing the cops to do their job, the second Crosby as a news reporter trying to catch the story, and the third featuring Jaeckel as the beleaguered detective trying to investigate a killer whose got no real pattern or motive.  Perhaps the saving grace of the film is its strong and capable cast including those I've mentioned, along with some other seasoned players like Keenan Wynn, as Crosby's hard nosed, yet soft hearted boss, who was just a really wonderful character actor and always fun to watch, and Casey Kasem, credited as the `pathologist'.  Both men had minor parts, but they made a good showing.  As far as the killer goes, we don't get to see a whole lot of him, other than some brief glimpse throughout, at least not until the end, during the final confrontation, which was actually fairly anti-climatic.  The killer, who had inhuman strength, also has some sort of supernatural abilities, but this was never fully explored, nor were the reasons why it came to Earth, or why it felt the need to murderlate.  This really didn't bother me as I don't expect everything to explained in simple terms.  One really weird aspect was some of his victims died from being blown apart from his laser beam eye blasts, but this is never really talked about by the police, only that all his victims were mutilated and decapitated...I suppose if someone is blown apart that is a form of decapitation, but whatever...there is one scene where we do get to see one dude beheaded (featured in a bloodless long shot), and it was kinda funny seeing his headless body take a few steps before falling over.  Another humorous aspect was after each crime, we see the bagged bodies being loaded into the coroner's station wagon, along with someone carrying a little blue bag which presumably contained the head of the victim, being placed along the body (some accuse me of having a sick sense of humor).  Overall the direction is adequate, and there are even a few suspenseful, albeit murky scenes (check out the one with Wynn in the parking garage), but the one aspect I found really annoying was whenever we got to a point in the movie where the killer was going to strike, there'd be some suitable music, along with a whispering voice, saying something like ""The daaaark...""  Why this was done I have no idea, but it was unnecessary and only served to draw me out of the film trying to figure out what the hell it was, and where it was coming from...

Shriek Show provides a strong, anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture on this DVD release (there are signs of age present, but nothing too distracting), and a decent Dolby Digital mono audio track.  As far as extras go, there's a wonderful interview with the director John 'Bud' Cardos where he talks about the film, and also his experiences movies in general, along with a commentary track with Cardos and fan Scott Spiegel, writer of Evil Dead 2, and a couple of trailers for the film, one an original, rough looking theatrical trailer, the second a double billing featuring The Dark along with the film Beyond the Door II.  Also included are trailers for other releases like Just Before Dawn (1981), The Being (1983), Love Bites (2001), Devil Dog (1978), Plaga Zombie Zona Mutante (2001), Rojo Sangre (2004), Hiruko (1990), and Choking Hazard (2004).

By the way, that is Philip Michael Thomas aka Tubbs, from ""Miami Vice"", as the mouthy punk, credited as `Corn Rows', giving Richard Jaeckel's character some lip during the scene where the public is getting uppity with the police...and if you ever wanted to hear wholesome, cute as a button Cathy Lee Crosby say the word `sh*t', here's your chance...so very naughty...",1135987200,7,7570,4.755148741418764
2054199,5,B00021LGPK,"Here's a film that borrows elements from not one, but two distinct decades of horror: 1950s bug-eyed monster movies, and 1970s supernatural TV horror.

I know no term for that 1970s style of supernatural TV horror, but you know it if you've seen it. Shows like Ghost Story/Circle of Fear, Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Night Gallery, The Darkroom. TV movies like Horror at 37,000 Feet (1972), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973), and The Initiation of Sarah (1978). Theatrical films like The Evil (1978, aka Cry Demon, House of Evil), Burnt Offerings (1976), and The Sentinel (1977) share some of that sensibility. Many 1970s supernatural horror productions feature that same canned music; an eerie harpsichord piece and/or a trilling flute noise.

The Dark opens with a long informational scroll across the screen, read by an ominous narrator, informing us of the various deadly ways in which species adapt to life on Earth, speculating that the same likely occurs elsewhere in the universe, and suggesting that not all first encounters with such life forms are likely to be friendly...

This somber silliness evokes those 1950s BEM movies in which some narrator or scientist delivers an overly-long bit of pseudo-science, spoken with the stern seriousness of a high-school biology film strip. Although, it may also have been inspired by Star Wars's screen scroll, that film released only two years earlier.

The Dark's informational scroll culminates with a red ball of light hurtling toward Earth. We cut to a young woman exiting a movie theater. Oddly, it's night and the streets are deserted. Was she the only patron? Anyway, she's properly frightened, and scurries up the street. She hears footsteps. Spooky voices whisper...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

She quickens, runs, ducks, thinks she's safe... An alien monster rips off her head! (No, you don't see it. Despite the alien's MO, you only see one decapitation in the entire film. This film isn't too gory.) Anyway, thus begins...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

I say ""Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!"" because whenever it's dark and lonely, and some character is wandering about, that eerie (and eerily familiar) canned 1970s music is mixed with non-diagetic spooky voices whispering...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

Such non-diagetic whispering makes no sense. This is not a supernatural film. No spirits or ghosts. Just a gypsy fortune teller with some clairvoyance. It seems the whisperings were added solely to create atmosphere, and frighten us with...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

And to assure we're scared, characters oblige us by wandering about dark deserted hallways, parking lots, streets, nervously glancing about, sometimes killed, sometimes not. Yet despite the title, this is not a film about the dark, but about a killer alien.

While the atmospheric style is 1970s, the monster story is 1950s, with a shamelessly cheesy alien. Its hands resemble Lon Chaney's werewolf, hairy with long dark fingernails. It hurriedly stumbles after our heroes in what appears to be (in silhouette) Frankenstein monster boots. Its red cat-like eyes shoot raygun beams that toss people across a room before causing them to explode without a trace.

That's the atmosphere and monster. Here are the characters and story:

The dead woman was the daughter of horror novelist Roy Warner (William Devane). Devane has made a career out of playing clean-cut authority figures, but here he is scruffy and long-haired, as befits a horror novelist. Naturally, Roy Warner has also done prison for manslaughter, his novels are ""nothing but blood and gore,"" and he lives in a pricey Hollywood Hills house.

Hey, aren't ALL horror novelists fabulously rich felons who only write blood and gore? (As The Dark was released in 1979, I assume the ""rich"" part was modeled on someone's idea of Stephen King.)

Roy Warner is one of The Dark's more original characters, as the film is a parade of stereotypes. We have two cops assigned to catch the killer. One's a clean-cut straight-arrow (Richard Jaeckel), the other's a pudgy slob (Biff Elliot) forever dripping donut filling. This allows for the usual comic relief, as when Jaeckel tells Elliot to ""buy a bib.""

Hey, that's funny stuff.

(Okay, let's not judge too harshly. The critically acclaimed Hill Street Blues was still recycling cop/donut jokes years after The Dark.)

The Dark has the usual Police Captain (Warren J. Kemmerling) who gets heat from the mayor, hates the press, and wants to ""keep a tight lid"" on events. You've met him in many a Kolchak episode. When one cop suggests the killer is a ""zombie,"" the Captain explodes: ""Zombie! Mangler! I don't want to here any of that!""

The Dark also has a bizarre gypsy fortune teller, a midget newspaper vendor (more comic relief), and jive-talking blacks (one of them wearing a puffy denim pimp cap). Philip Michael Thomas (Miami Vice) has a bit part as an angry young black man. In fact, the Internet Movie Database credits Thomas as ""Angry Young Black Man."" This is noteworthy, because the film credits refer to Thomas's character as: ""Corn Rows.""

Well, his hair IS in corn rows.

Cathy Lee Crosby (That's Incredible) plays Zoe, a crusading TV reporter. And yes, although hired for her looks, she's tired of covering fluff, and wants to do hard news in ""the big league.""

Zoe's supposed to be bright, but she's not very. At least not as written. Zoe pontificates that it's ""ironic"" that the daughter of a horror novelist (who trades in gore) was killed in gory fashion. Warner accuses Zoe of implying that it was ""poetic justice."" Zoe insists she meant ironic, but that's because she's illiterate. Irony requires incongruity, so it would have been ironic if Warner's books had promoted peace.

I don't think the screenwriter intended Zoe to be illiterate, but she is.

Zoe's illiteracy also causes her to be self-contradictory. She accuses detective Jaeckel of not doing enough to find the killer. Moments later, she switches and accuses him of going too far (""Thirty-two caliber justice?"" she accuses).

One senses the screenwriter was writing cool clich&eacute;s, unaware when his lines were contradictory. Zoe is supposed to be smart and idealistic, yet if one listens, she sounds illiterate and ego-driven. But since Crosby looks good, we're not really listening to her Zoe.

I've discussed atmosphere, monster, characters. I haven't gotten to the story yet? Well, the ""story"" is simple. What you'd expect. Characters wander about...

Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!

Occasionally, their heads are ripped off, or shot into nothingness by the alien's red raygun eye beams (I call them eye beams, but sometimes they look more like mini-photon torpedoes). Curiously, when one jive-talking black guy goes in search of his prostitute, he gets shot with those eye beams and explodes into nothingness. But later, it's reported that he was decapitated. Then, when another character burns and disappears into nothingness, the remaining characters marvel that there appears to be nothing left.

As Warner and Zoe repeat to each other: ""Weird.""

Eventually, clues are found and the alien is cornered. At which point, the heroes run away. The cops arrive, and there's much shooting of guns and eye beams. The alien snatches Zoe and, maintaining proper 1950s BEM standards, for the first time in the film he does not instantly kill his victim. Seems he just wants to hold Zoe, maybe carry her off somewhere. This gives her time to scream and be rescued.

The Dark was produced by Film Ventures International, a prolific horror film company during the rise of video. It eventually went bankrupt, the fate of many indie startups. Much later, The Dark was re-released on video as The Mutilator, making all that whispering of ""Theeeee da-a-a-a-a-a-ark"" all the more nonsensical. (Not to be confused with the 1985 slasher film, The Mutilator, aka Fall Break).

The Dark is hardly original or great. And despite its comic relief or cheesy clich&eacute;s, it's not intended as parody. Nor is it unintentionally funny. But it is fun.

If you like 1950s BEM movies, if you like 1970s TV supernatural thrillers, then you'll enjoy this walk through...
