8182178,5,B000NW8U20,"Unlike the suggestive title, this is a mixed-up trilogy of tales about a woman dying of cancer and the kidnapping of a petroleum magnate, the woman's memories about the tycoon, and the woman's imaginary vision of herself as someone living in the 1930s married to an arms dealer. All three stories intertwine to such a degree that the viewers, along with the dying woman, may start to confuse present reality from past indiscretions from wishful thinking.
