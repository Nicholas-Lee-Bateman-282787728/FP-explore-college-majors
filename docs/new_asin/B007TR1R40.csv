Too bad  it only ran  5 episodes. It may have done better as a 5  part  ( 2 hour ) mini series,  instead of a regular  show.  Another one was he was in was "" Un -Sub""  ( pre CSI and X -files)  which I think ran for eight or nine  episodes.  Glad I bought it. And I did purchase it off Amazon.com",1412899200,,462,3.702127659574468
8521808,4,B007TR1R40,"Being a fan of the original Cassablanca I was sceptical about this short lived series.  I was pleasenly suprised, good cast, however I could not get pass David Soul in a roll other than Hutch of Starsky and Hutch.  Glad I got it.",1405296000,2,229,4.3023255813953485

I'm glad to see this has been released on DVD.

Having appeared in the Premiere episode, ""Who Am I Killing"" (note the young soldier machine-gunning poor Trisha Noble in the final scene), I will add my support for K. Harris's compliment on the production. The set was magnificent. As for ""why, why, why"", remember this was not the only time Casablanca was turned into a TV series. The Premiere Episode of the 1955 series is included in the Casablanca 3-DVD box set Ultimate Collector's Edition from Warner Home Video&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca-Ultimate-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B001EL6EHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca (Ultimate Collector's Edition)</a>. And certainly the network's motivation for this series was to catch the wave of popularity from Raiders of the Lost Ark. I also appeared in Bring 'em Back Alive, which was produced for the same reason.

Producer, David Wolper, is a master. He spared nothing in production values. In addition to the Art Direction and Set Design mentioned in K. Harris's review, here are just some of the other masters on this shoot: Layne ""Shotgun"" Britton (Make-up Artist, first credited on ""Citizen Cane"" + about 50 additional credits), Joe Biroc (Cinematography - first DP credit was It's A Wonderful Life. Over 150 subsequent DP credits! Oscar winning DP for Towering Inferno), Ralph Senensky (Director - nearly 100 shows from Twilight Zone to Hart to Hart). It was an honor, indeed, for this to be my first SAG gig.",1341273600,12,1586,5.46530612244898
8521810,5,B007TR1R40,"I thought this was great. David Soul portrayed the role of Rick very well, granted nobody will ever top Bogey but David comes as close as anyone I've seen. It's too bad the series only lasted for such a short time. The scenery was great, the supporting actors were well played. You felt like you were transported back in time to that era. I really enjoyed watching, wish there would have been more. If your a David Soul fan, which I am, you willing really like this one.",1341100800,9,470,4.3522727272727275
