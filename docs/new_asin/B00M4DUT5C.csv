6557090,5,B00M4DUT5C,"BEST SEASON, EVEN BETTER THAN SEASON ONE: I watched it four times!!! Love it. But, Amazon you really need to order more I want to buy it!!!",1421971200,3,139,4.185185185185185
6557091,5,B00M4DUT5C,"Fans of Gillian Anderson will be rewarded with the second series of 'The Fall'. In the first series we were treated to the murders of women by a serial killer. The killings were brutal and terrifying, and we were privy to the murderer, Paul Spector. This is a who dunnit backwards. We know the murderer, we know how he acts, but we do not know too much about him.

Anderson plays DCI Stella Gibson, on loan to Belfast from London. She is an ice queen, beautiful and beds any man she wants. Much like the men she works with, she decides who her partner will be and when. In Series 2, the murders continue, and Stella has a plan. Her team is smart, but she is the leader, and Stella goes inside the mind of the serial killer. Paul Spector is played by Jamie Dornan. He is a charmer, good looking, married with two children. The love of his life is his daughter, and she is a daddy's girl.

As the series proceeds we get to know Stella on a more emotional, personal level. We also get inside the mind of Paul, or he allows us in. This is a fascinating experience, this is a man whose intelligence is matched by his good looks and his killing ways. We also meet one other woman and her family. She survived Paul's attack, and after the trauma trying to remember the incident. This is a tension filled series that gets better each episode. DCI Stella Gibson is a woman not to be deterred by anything, sure of herself, but with issues as we all have. A strong woman in a man's world and she can beat them all.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-21-15",1421798400,19,1541,4.3068965517241375
6557092,5,B00M4DUT5C,"Gillian Anderson is amazing in Part 2 of this dark and addictive crime series.
I was thinking about giving it four stars as there is one plot twist that I thought was a bit of a leap (no spoiler here), but the acting, character development,  and overall intelligence of the script is so good, I gave it a five. A do not miss for lovers of dark crime drama.
I hope it doesn't take as long for Season 3 to be produced!",1421539200,29,416,4.073170731707317

Possible Spoilers

This series as with the first exhibits disturbing voyeurism, where the audience is placed in the uncomfortable position of watching the killer, as he carries out his perverse crimes. Unlike other shows in the genre, the audience is precluded from a synopsis of dangling different suspects to maintain suspense - as we already know the psychopath from the onset. The figure we are given is a humanised psychopath because the homicidal sadist was not some socially pathetic loser, but a softly spoken man called Paul Spector, with a wife and a loving daughter, and a career as a bereavement counsellor. The Fall, has been called the most popular drama in the last two decades (the in UK media) and has returned for series two very much as a slow burn thriller as opposed to a bang.

This is a series that stands accused of misogyny, and of portraying the glamorisation violence against women. The first episode is set some 10 days after series one's unresolved, if not vexing, finale. The episode follows a prolonged hunt for a murder weapon in a Belfast river, and a hospital bed testimonial from Spector's half-strangled victim Annie Brawley, there is Spector's return from self-imposed exile. There are a total of six episodes in series two, for me a cleverly crafted series that on one level or another makes the viewer pretty uncomfortable - and poses some very disturbing questions about for example relationships, the effects of 'grooming' on children, as well as adults, and at times seems to come close to crossing the line - my humble opinion.

The BBC(UK) have announced that there is to be a season 3

Just flip the switch that will give the audience, across the pond, the next season.

6557129,3,B00M4DUT5C,"Well, it was okay but I would not recommend it to anyone.  Gillian Anderson's ""accent"" and her monotone voice and one facial expression, that of a constipated person, were pretty boring.  The relationship between her and the commanding officer in Belfast was clich.  Some of the characters were just downright unbelievable and almost laughable - like that crazy Jimmy and his friends.  The first season was actually pretty good, but S2 was just an effort to watch.  The killer gets a hold of the dream diary of the cop investigating him, - yawn!!!  The long walk in the woods to find the final victim and then the  killer getting gut shot at the end with Gibson all concerned about him and not even glancing at her fellow LEO who was shot.  Gibson is as sick as Peter Paul Baldwin Spector.  I won't be watching S3 if they throw one out.",1487980800,,836,4.52

6557150,4,B00M4DUT5C,"As we know, Gillian Anderson is good actress in X-files and she's done well in this series. We really moving with the plot and see Gillian as Stella Gibson, the role just suits her well.

Jamie Dornan also gives the best out of him in this series. If you only know Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey, when you see this series, you will see different side of Dornan. He's done really well too. They are pretty good pair in this series. They played like cat and mouse. running and chasing.
I think they attract to each other in a weird way.

I believe in yin and yang symbol, which means the very bad person has a good side too. I see Spector is a good daddy. Even Stella confirmed this at his daughter interview, saying his daughter is protecting her daddy at all cost and teardrop appeared on her cheek. I was crying when I saw Spector hug his daughter saying he won't be home for a while, he means farewell.

I just finish watched Season 2, going to watch season 3 soon. I can say this series is pretty good. It gives curiosity at end of every episode. the plot is smooth and easy to follow. Somehow I can see it is a bit slower. Like if I skip one episode and jump to next episode, I will not missed that much, because the story is about running and chasing. The excellent acts of both Gibson and Spector keeps us going and watching.

6557159,3,B00M4DUT5C,"I found this series interesting enough to watch all the way through, but only because there weren't that many episodes in either season. Im glad I did, because I learned that Dr. Reed is the only person of color in England, Ireland, and Scotland.  Whodathunkit? It was nice to hear that  Reggie got to use her real accent in this show, because her American accent in The Good Wife was so inconsistent. I was also glad she played a character that could keep her pants on. Although it was lame that she didn't sleep with Gillian, because of where she grew up, and the character is in her 30s! Really? Not because her religion forbids homosexuality. Oh no, her childhood zip code set her moral compass.
There are actual  spoilers ahead.  They obviously opted to wrap this up in a messy bow, once the show was cancelled. In a way, thats better than ending with a cliffhanger. This is another show where all of the bad guys are psychic, while the good guys remain constantly behind.  For instance, how did Paul know what hotel Gillian (can't remember her character's name) was staying in? How did Jimmy, and the photographer, know exactly where in the forest they were taking Paul? How did Paul know that something was going on between Gillian and Thomas?  How was the babysitter smart enough to know that Paul would need alibis for every night that a murder happened, but she was too stupid to figure out that he was really a killer?  Note, I don't think it was unreasonable that Sally didn't know about Paul. Wives of real life serial killers haven't picked up on it (i.e. Gary Ridgeway's wife had not a clue, and he was killing hookers for years). I understood that Gillian's character was being portrayed as a woman, who like men, had sex for sex sake, and who wasn't afraid to initiate it. But, the character came off as desperate, rather than liberated. She also had terrible judgment.  She first assumed that a man shed  only seen out of a car window would have a lax attitude about sex similar to hers.  Then she jumped into bed with him,  without any prior discussion to confirm whether or not that was the case. Later, she left the precinct at a crucial time, with the man she hadl put in charge of interrogating the killer, just so they could have sex.  Okey-dokey. I also did not understand why an abused woman in a safe house, would go walking along the side of the road, when she was supposed to be hiding from a husband who apparently had spies from one end of town to the other.  Or why a guard in a jail was privy to all of the insider task force details surrounding the handling of this serial killer. In the final act, the cops are told to not let anybody enter the forest (which in and of itself seems like a daunting task), but they didn't even try. Seriously, how is a photographer going to both keep up with moving vehicles on foot, in order to take pictures of them finding Rose, and avoid being seen? The cops eventually see him, but they don't see or hear Jimmy in a car when there are no other vehicles on the road?  The people in the helicopter don't see the car  either, but they did see the man on foot (huh?). In fact, Jimmy somehow manages to not only drive right up to where they are holding Paul. He is also then able to get out of his car with a gun, and shoot at Paul multiple times. No matter, that Paul is surrounded by cops at the time, and is even handcuffed to one.",1477785600,,3401,4.367670364500793

6557200,1,B00M4DUT5C,"Ah were to begin. Well first there is Gillain Anderson mumbling  with what I think is an Irish maybe, no an English accent?, who the heck knows but she does it thought the whole series. Her character Stella Gibson is a very unlikeable. She has total contempt for men and shows it by sleeping with everyone of them she can, but only once. We are suppose to believe she is so desirable  that men half her age will just jump right in to bed with her married or not. In fact  the only person in the show strong enough not to fall for her womanly charms is another women. The show is also filled and I mean filled with scenes that could easily be half as long and not only be just as impactful but even more so.  Jamie Dornan did a good job in the first year as the psycho killer but was weighted down with bad writing that was stretched out to for no other reason then to milk this thing for all it was worth. And now I find out they made a  third season?! good lord. And plotholes especially when it come to investigating part are to many to list.  The shows heavy handed approach to man hating is probably its worst  aspect. The only two strong men in the show are the killer and a wife beater. The rest of the men are weak feckless individuals easily manipulated by Gillain Anderson's characters' vagina. I would be really fine with a strong female lead like Milla Jovovich in Resedent Evil but Gillain Andersons character has no redeeming qualities i would like any of my daughters to have.",1465430400,,1490,4.2811387900355875

6557233,5,B00M4DUT5C,"This is a terrific follow-up to Series 1. Gillian Anderson portrays her character, Stella Gibson, with smoldering intensity and Jamie Dornan plays the serial killer Spector with such superficial restraint that it is hard to believe that he truly is a sadistic killer. His portrayal is chilling because he appears to be the man next door: loving father and kind, caring grief counselor. There is nothing about him that would set off alarms in anyone meeting him and that is truly frightening. The introduction of the strange relationship between Spector and the 16-year old girl brings a new level of creepiness to the series. All in all this is an excellent thriller, with stellar acting and a plot that is unexpected and full of twists. It is a complicated, harrowing story populated with three-dimensional characters. Even the heroes have flaws. You will not be disappointed but you must watch Series 1 first.",1458864000,6,911,5.0

6557253,5,B00M4DUT5C,"The Fall, Series 2.  This award-winning psychological thriller contains all six episodes from the international hit second television series of the BBC crime drama. It stars Gillian Anderson as a London Metropolitan Police detective seconded to Belfast , Northern Ireland, to help on a puzzling murder case. She hadnt totally convinced her superiors of it, but Stella Gibson believed a serial killer is in action, begins to investigate.  Meanwhile, in this examination of two hunters, the killer, Paul Spector, stalks his victims in and around the city.

Belfast is on display in all its threatening glory in this dark British production, as well it should be, considering its blood-soaked recent past, when Catholic and Protestant fought to a draw.

The citys menacing weather  make that Northern Irelands threatening weather, I guess-- is also well on display: constant dark days, never ending rain, snow. Its now been 10 days since serial killer Spector, (Jamie Dornan, FIFTY SHADES OF GREY) fled Belfast; Gibson (Golden Globe winner Anderson, BLEAK HOUSE, THE X-FILES) feels she is running out of time to catch him. Then Spector commits a brazen crime to silence someone from his past; Gibson finds crucial evidence that puts her on his trail once more.  The police procedural, created, written and directed by Allan Cubitt, boasts top-drawer acting from the battling principals on down. Anderson mesmerizes as the strong, self-possessed detective who takes no prisoners, while Dornan proves disturbingly charismatic as Spector, who is both sadistic killer and loving father. They are more than ably backed by John Lynch as John Burns, Gibsons local police supervisor; Bronagh Waugh as Sally Ann Spector, the killers unsuspecting wife; Archie Panjabi as Dr. Reed Smith, forensics expert and friend of Gibsons and Aisling Franciosi, batting way above her pay grade as Katie Benedetto, dangerously deluded teenager who babysits for the Spectors.  The episodes are:

1. These Troublesome Disguises. Paul has left behind surviving victims that could ruin his perfect double life. However, if his last intended victim, who survived, ultimately cant remember him, Stella's investigation might go cold.
2. Night Darkens the Street. Spector kidnaps most damaging witness Rose, escalates the manhunt.
3. Beauty Hath Strange Power. Spector becomes  prime suspect;  cops  still focused on  Rose.
4. The Mind Is Its Own Place.  Cops have Spector under surveillance, lose him temporarily.  Stella still uneasy about his having gotten into her room.
5. The Perilous Edge of Battle. Spector attempts escape as the cop shop closes in on him.
6. What Is in Me Dark Illumine. Spector, his wife, and Katie all in custody. Spector will talk only to Stella, violation of procedures. Powerful, unexpected conclusion leaves room for third series to come.

This boxed set, which I received for review purposes, consists of two discs, totaling six episodes, at approximately 403 minutes. It has a behind the scenes featurette, (12 mins.); deleted scenes, (9 mins.); photo gallery.  And subtitles, thank goodness, unless you're accustomed to the Belfast brogue, which even my first generation Irish American husband sadly isnt.  But be warned, strong language, violence, nudity, sexual situations, disturbing images.  The production is compelling, disturbing, taut and tense: the interview scenes, which some critics smarter than I call the heart of police procedurals, are extraordinarily tense, especially the last one, of Gibson and Spector. There's even the odd comic scene tossed in for change of pace: one in which we learn that Dr. Smith ""grew up in Croydon."" Have to say, I loved series two every bit as well as the first, (and thats unusual for me). On its web site here, also reviewed the first, which won the 2014 Irish Film and TV Awards for Best TV Drama, Best Lead Actor (Dornan), Best Original Score.  Anyway, in this house, we came as near binge-watching this superb release as we physically could, finishing a disc a night.",1456272000,7,4018,5.240249609984399
6557254,5,B00M4DUT5C,"Evidently lots of people don't realize that British series almost always come out first in Region 2 format, then only later in Region 1.

It seems to me kind of counterproductive to grade the product down because it hasn't yet come out in the format one's looking for -- or to buy a Region-2-format disc without noticing or knowing the difference, and then to grade the product down because of the customer's own mistake.

Just me $.02.",1455926400,3,436,4.64935064935065
6557255,5,B00M4DUT5C,"Not my 1st choice of series, yet it grabbed fast and consumed my mind. A psychological dramathose minds at work on both sides of murder. Dark, no fully-acceptable characters to connect to, all tainted to some degree. Belfasts version of Rizzoli & Isles but not as refined as that 6-star series. One primary case (serial killer) carries over from The Fall series one and the killer is a series lead character. If you missed season one, no problem, they reflect to give newcomers any necessary history. THE FALL is already scheduled for season 3. This psycho-thriller has a deep dark edge, much suspense is depicted by characters in thought (no dialogue) and eerie music. It never claimed to be action; instead it is a deep psychological study, a multi-dimensional mind game in a cat-&-mouse search for a killer. Not for everyone, its intellectual intrigue, and a 9-multi-award winner. Yet, it keeps your interest. Compelling.
Come to think, you may want to watch Series 1 again first, then this new release picks up the story just ten days later.

I won't go into specifics, so I don't ruin the plot for anyone, but I found the second season to be very slow. I had to watch until the end, but several times along the way I thought, ""when is it finally going to be over?!"" From what I understand, filming of Season 3 will begin at the end of the year. However, after seeing season 2 drag on, and the way that it ended, my question is why even do a third season?",1435536000,,586,3.9327731092436973

6557287,2,B00M4DUT5C,"I love this series, but I am quite upset about what appears to me to be a major failure of the writers to research trauma and sex crime procedures in the UK. A rape victim is simply NEVER put in with a male therapist so soon after an attack (she is still in the hospital!). It is also highly improbable a woman who experienced such an attack would even be able to speak to a therapist in an intimate context without the risk of triggering. Further, women whom have been raped or otherwise attacked aren't given grief counselors, they're given trauma counselors. This series takes place now, not in the 80's and 90's when this was unfortunately not the case. Shame! Research FAIL.",1429315200,2,679,4.528455284552845

6557291,1,B00M4DUT5C,"This program, consisting of two series on four discs turns what should have been a forty-five minute to one-hour program into ten very slow hours stretched over twelve episodes. To accept this unrealistic drama one must accept as fact a criminal is far smarter than everyone else in this world. All the witnesses and victims are fully compliant and willing cover for the killer and all of the police personnel are dimwitted, all the crime scenes are free of any forensic evidence or CCTV and it takes the investigators ten plus years to ultimately stumble across a suspect. In the end, neither the serial killer nor the viewer receive any justice.",1423440000,2,647,4.837837837837838
6557292,2,B00M4DUT5C,"Warning: possible spoilers.

Season 2 of The Fall suggests strongly that DCI Stella Gibson should have got her man at the end of season one.  The problems with season two are many.  First of all, I don't think there is an equivalent word to misogynist for hatred of men but if there were it would definitely apply here.  At one point Gillian Anderson's Gibson says that men are a genetic aberration and at another suggests that all men are capable of rape and violence against women.  If you are a man who isn't a rapist and has never hit a woman it's hard not to be offended by this sexist garbage.  Then there's the fact that Jamie Dornan's serial killer doesn't actually kill anyone in series two.  He kidnaps a woman but that's hardly the same thing, is it?  Then there are the subplots that don't work.  When babysitter Katie runs into the serial killer's wife she is aghast to find out he claimed they had an affair and tells her he attempted to sexually assault her.  Then Paul Spector sneaks into her house and threatens her and she accuses him of being the serial killer.  Then she decides she's madly in love with him.  I know we are dealing with raging teen hormones here but even so that progression of events makes no logical sense.  Then there's the wife-beating thug.  At one point he and an associate fire on two cops and he steals a police officer's gun and the female officer who got shot in her flap-jacket lets him get away rather than take a clear shot through the windshield of his van.  Then later he removes a tracking device from his ankle--so he not only shot at cops but they can't find him even with a tracking device strapped to his ankle.  Then he steals the car and phone of a reporter who knows the police are after him and who doesn't report the theft even though he could be charged as an accessory if the hot headed thug commits a crime in the borrowed car.  It's just flat out stupid.  Season one was good but season two is little more than spinning wheels for 6 episodes until DCI Gibson finally gets her man.",1423353600,2,2046,4.381962864721485
6557293,4,B00M4DUT5C,"I liked the set-up from the first five chapters. The story, characters etc. were all of a high order. This is a good continuation of that.

Here's the scoop. Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) is still working the Paul Spector serial killer case. Little by little the clues are adding up and pointing her and her team in his direction. But there are a couple of unexpected turns that put the team on a clock that is counting down quickly. Add to that the emergence of an avid Paul Spector fan and things get really dicey.

For the most part I liked this a lot. As in the first five episodes most or the writing and all of the acting is top shelf. Great attention is paid to procedures. Their CSI teams seem to be of extremely high discipline. Their booking and interrogational procedures are also very disciplined. As things point to the culprit there were still a couple of episodes to go so I wondered how they would keep things going. They managed that very well. This is as much character driven as it is plot driven. The two are balanced very well.

There were a couple of not so good decisions made though. One is the introduction of a second investigator who is to work alongside Gibson and at her same level. They set this up as a rubbing point but it's anything but. The new guy is a decent, by the book dude. There are no head-butts and he ends up being little more than wall paper. Also is another investigator brought in to help. He showed no real expertise not already present on the team so he becomes little more than Gibson's sex toy. Then there is the ending. I suppose there is something to be said about the irony of it but it disappointed me. To have that happen to the team after all they'd been through to nab this miserable puke put me off.

That being said, this is still a heck of a series. For those who liked ""The Killing"" or ""The Bridge"" this is a great entry to the genre.",1422403200,10,1899,4.310924369747899
6557294,5,B00M4DUT5C,"Season 2 of The Fall lives up to the production-quality standards of the first season.  We begin 10 days after the end of season one; Paul has escaped to Scotland but then promptly returns to Belfast.  The Stella/Paul cat/mouse pursuit covers six episodes.  The first five are one hour in length, the final episode approximately ninety minutes.

The ending comes very slowly.  This is not a problem of narrative rhythm.  The point is (spoilers coming) that we do not watch Stella and her team finally identify Paul in the last fifteen minutes of the show and then rush through a car chase until he is cornered.  He is identified as the prime suspect far earlier and a good part of the final episodes is spent narrowing the search, following him in an attempt to find an abductee who may still be alive and, in an extended climax, interviewing/interrogating him in one very long, riveting scene.

As in the first season, we learn a great deal about Stella's private life as well and she is up to her old pursuits in the second season, hitting on/bedding inappropriate individuals.  In her interview with Paul he is at pains to understand her personality, just as she is at pains to understand his.

What appears to be a tangential subplot actually becomes a significant plot element as the story reaches its crescendo.  All of the strengths of the first season are here in evidence: a fascinating creepiness, sexual tension, strong direction, interesting characters, engaging psychological analysis.  The pace is a bit slower in the second season, by design, and the procedural elements of the investigation are highlighted.  There are some unexpected plot shifts that surprise us without disappointing us.

Very strong television drama.  Not to be missed.",1422230400,3,1755,4.9419795221843

8670248,5,B00M4DUT5C,"This is more than I expected.  It took me a while to get in to the series, don't watch much BBC, but I watched it only because of Jamie Dornan.  I wanted to see what else he can do besides love Anastasia Steele.  He was really good.

It is not a mystery in that you now who is committing the murders right away, but a very interesting cat and mouse game.  It leaves you guessing many things about the murderer right up to the end of the third season.  The end took me by surprise, but still leaves you guessing why and almost makes you feel compassion for the killer, but wait, should you.
definitely worth the watch.  Good character complexities.  Not a fan of Gillian Anderson, but liked her in this complex roll.",1529539200,,715,4.2835820895522385
