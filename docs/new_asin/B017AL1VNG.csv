7498408,1,B017AL1VNG,One of the worst blu ray ever. Looks even worse than dvd. I regret purchasing it. While Lee is great and loved him as dracula the blu ray is not worth even 5 $. Stay away from it,1453420800,4,178,3.710526315789474
7498409,2,B017AL1VNG,"Just to be clear, this is a review of the movie, not the blu-ray or DVD. I bought this sight unseen on DVD many years ago because I imagined, ""Christopher Lee, Klaus Kinski, authentic version of Dracula story, how could I go wrong?"" But I overlooked the biggest factor in my purchase and that was Jess Franco. To be fair, I was not expecting a ""masterpiece"" but just something a little entertaining.

The movie starts out well enough, but is immediately plagued with mismatched lighting and ""odd"" zooming effects. When we get to Christopher Lee, it was very interesting to watch him portray this Count as a different character than in the Hammer films, so I was intrigued. Even so, the movie was struggling through strange creative decisions. Eventually, everything moves on to London and at that point it's as though the entire crew just gave up. Every single scene involving a bat is, frankly, laughable. But those scenes are ""bone-chilling"" compared to the scene where Harker and Quincy get ""attacked"" by various stuffed animals including an ""out of focus"" owl. How did that even make the final cut??? Bewildering... I found myself rewinding that one scene over and over and laughing till I cried.

Then there is the abysmal waste of Klaus Kinski. He does not speak one line in the entire film. There seems to be this shoehorned in subplot involving Kinski and Dracula that we never see but are only told about. Somehow after Dracula has killed the man's daughter, Kinski is sort of telepathically linked to Dracula. But in the context of this film, that makes no sense since none of Dracula's other victims are so afflicted. It almost seems like they filmed the movie, cut it together, saw how lacking it was and thought, ""maybe if we added scenes with another known actor we can capture the international market.""
Unfortunately, their budget probably could not cover the cost of paying him to actually speak in this ""role"".

So much in the film seems to make no sense. Van Helsing is an expert in matters of the occult, in fact, he mentions in the film that this is why they bring Harker to his hospital. However, given this fact and the fact that he knows about Dracula, he only decides to go into action after Lucy has been attacked several times and turned into a vampire. Harker is no better either since he only remembers he sold Dracula the property directly opposite the hospital after they dispatch the vampire Lucy.

There are some very interesting bits such as Dracula becoming younger as he drinks blood, but those bits inevitably get lost by the inability of the film makers to make what should have been gold, truly shine. Some of those bits have made their way into other, better vampire films since the release of this one.

Now, I know there may be some who thoroughly enjoy this film. There may be others that will say, ""What did you expect, Wuthering Heights?"" and I guess that's a fair statement. I guess I do tend to expect a little more when I buy a movie and I remember when I bought this I felt I had been robbed. I bought it at a local video store (remember those?) and there was no other recourse since I had opened it but to try to sell it to someone else to try to regain some of my monetary loss. So, bottom line... if you feel you might have my sensibilities about movies, I won't say, ""Don't buy this movie!"" I realize everybody has their own personal opinions and tastes. But I will say, with very little effort you can see this movie for free online, please do that before you plunk down your cash on this one.",1451088000,20,3547,4.562009419152276

7498415,3,B017AL1VNG,"This is Jess Franco's production of Bram stoker's novel Dracula
which happens to have Christopher Lee playing Dracula
i bought this blu-ray out of curiosity, cause i was big fan of Chris Lee and the Hammer horror films
i have regrets buying it now, let me explain
spanish Director Jess Franco decided to make his version of Dracula with Christopher Lee playing the part
way back in 1969, the screenplay was written by Augusto Finocchi who actually did a very close faithful adaption
of the novel by Bram stoker, you can see the screenplay being worked on in every scene
so that was the Idea to make the most faithful adaption possible
problem was is that the production was extreme lowbudget
the Camera work is very Good and of course well Directed by Jess Franco
but some of the Acting was very average, and the story did become boring in some scenes
Christopher Lee's portrayal of Dracula is the only Highlight in this film
the staking scenes and the Biting sucking scenes where Dracula bites into Lucy's neck
very below average acted, there's hardly no blood or Gore, just very tiny bit to the point where i found the scenes boring
the one big stake scene is of Lucy where not much is shown on screen it's a G rated scene really
there's no blood after effect when the wood stake goes into Lucy chest, no scream from her
there's just a very quick cut to her face where she's staring into space with make up blood around here lips
that's it that's all you get, i thought how pathetic crap acting really
the other staking scenes of Dracula's women is no different from the staking of Lucy
very quick cuts, no screams from the women, no actually scenes of the stake penetrating the chest to see bit of blood
it's bulls***, G rated scenes
and then you got the last scene before the credits roll where Dracula is finally Destroyed by John Harker & Quincy morris
chris lee is just laying in the wood box & John & Quincy just set him on fire and the you just see very quick cuts of his face melting
this film can almost be played a silent film for 1970, not much Dialogue, acting is below average, Hardly no blood or Gore
Hammer films were low budget aswell, but at least the acting and some of the blood and Gore was much better
waste of time watching it i think. i prefer Francis coppola's version to Jess franco's version
this new blu-ray by Severin films does have an excellent HD transfer in 1:33:1 fullscreen only cause that's what Jess franco wanted for
the screen ratio, he didn't even want to widen it to 1:66:1 at least
severin films did a great job cleaning the films Grain and Dirt so pit's very sharp & clear
the sound quality is only Mono sound
lots of special features some new & some from the special edition dvd
BELOVED COUNT interview with Jess franco on making the film
AUDIO COMMENTARY by Horror historian Davild del valle & Actress Maria rohm who played Mina harker in the film
Maria rohm gives lots of indepth info about Jess franco and some of the actors in the film
worth listening to for sure
there's some new interviews for this blu-ray, interview with Actor Jack Taylor and Actor Fred williams who played John Harker
there's also 75min behind the scenes footage of the film aswell
if you love Jess franco's films you'll love Count Dracula,
but if you love the Hammer films don't expect much from this low budget film version it's rated G or PG if that.
probably best to skip it
1-2 stars for the film, 3 stars for this new blu-ray version based on excellent transfer & lots of extras",1455494400,5,3505,4.452566096423017
7498416,4,B017AL1VNG,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

The Dracula legend has been around for over a century and has been told and retold many, many times.  As such, every filmmaker who puts the story onscreen puts his or her own spin on it.  Because of this, the actual story has become distorted and therefore, unless youve read the book, you don't know how true to the source material a film actually is.

From what Ive read, Jess Francos take on Dracula is fairly accurate, although he took liberties here and there.  But one thing is for certain:  his decision to cast Christopher Lee as the titular character was an excellent choice.  While COUNT DRACULA as a film itself is good, Lees portrayal of the vampire is uncanny and unsettling, a good enough reason alone to see what this movie has to offer.

Now remember:  this film was shot in 1970, therefore it is obviously dated.  But Severins HD restoration looks amazing, and it gives the film a new look and feel.

As mentioned, the acting in COUNT DRACULA is excellent, with Lee solidifying his status as a horror icon with his portrayal of the Count.  But following him up is Klaus Kinski as Renfield.  Kinski appears truly mad in this role, and I had no trouble believing his character to be real.  Also in the supporting cast is the incomparable Soledad Miranda, who Franco collaborated with several times prior to her death, and Herbert Lom as Van Helsing.

The story itself is nothing really new (as in, we have seen it before), but Franco does a great job of building a menacing atmosphere around the Count.  Theres plenty of tension involved, and the ultimate climax of the story is satisfying and fitting.

COUNT DRACULA is a big win from yesteryear, and fans of classic horror will want to grab this one soon.  I enjoyed this take on the legend, and I suggest you give it a shot.",1455494400,2,1865,4.532934131736527
7498417,3,B017AL1VNG,"Buyer beware.  This Blu Ray is advertised as having a bonus DVD

BONUS DISC: Cuadecuc Vampir- Pere Portabella's Expressionistic Behind-The-Scenes Feature

I was sorely dissappointed to find no such bonus DVD disc had been sent with the blu ray, and as this was one of the reasons I purchased this item it really soured my enjoyment of the disc.  In fact so disappointed was I that I did request to return the item, but from the UK its not easy to do so by following Amazons demands to arrange a carrier with the commercial invoice they request to use.  So I've decided to keep it, and not be so hasty to order any disc touting bonuses until satisfied that they actually have them in future!

As to the actual blu ray, I am happy with the picture quality - although the framing is not widescreen which lessens the impact.  Its a clean nice image and about the best I've seen it.  I think that any fan of Christopher Lee would want to own this movie, he finally gets to say all the lines from the novel - even the immortal line ""Children of the night - what music they make!""  The extra's (apart from the missing DVD!) are informative and amusing.

As I said my only gripe is that the item was not sold as advertised - and this has left me wary of buying from amazon usa in future.

Nice clutch of extra's and informative audio commentary.  As a fan of Chris Lee, this is the main selling point for me, and its great to hear Dracula actually speak of his heritage rather than just silently glide about his castle.",1454716800,9,1511,4.338078291814947

8738523,5,B017AL1VNG,"Those giving this film a poor review simply have no understanding of the genre.  This is a beautiful rendition of the Bram Stoker novel. But if you are the type of movie person that believes the quality of a movie is based on it's budget, stick to the schmaltzy Hollywood garbage like Coppola's ""Dracula.""  Jess Franco obviously shot this on a miniscule budget, but still manages to create a beautiful and atmospheric period piece. He also gets Christopher Lee's best performance of his illustrious career, as The Count.  He is brilliant in this, as is Klaus Kinski in the role of Renfield.  No actor can do ""crazy"" like this man, and Kinski's scenes inside the rubber room are outrageous. Franco regular, Soledad Miranda is delicately beautiful as the ill-fated Lucy, and the scene where she drifts off into the darkness with her child victim, is the stuff nightmares are made of.  Yes, the film can be choppy at times, but again, this is due to budget constraints. I also believe the lack of funds prevented Jess Franco from using a widescreen composition, which is odd because he usually shot his films in scope format.  The BluRay is great, as it restores a scene that is not present on the earlier dvd release.

8738527,5,B017AL1VNG,"Despite it's budgetary flaws and gritty cinematic approach, Jeff Franco's COUNT DRACULA is a welcome departure from the Hammer Dracula series and certainly one of the most atmospheric. This film works against the Hammer formula in ways that I've always found more memorable and interesting than Lee's other Dracula pictures. Franco's use of a zoom lens can be rather jarring upon first viewing, but overall the piece really works because of this unconventional visual approach. Bruno Nicolai's eerie, bare-bones score also adds to the impact. I've always appreciated this film and consider it my favorite Christopher Lee Dracula picture.",1481932800,5,637,5.444444444444445
8738528,5,B017AL1VNG,"I must disclose that I tend to like Jess Franco's work overall, as well as many of the other Euro-sleaze directors such as Bava and Argento.  I went through a phase a half-dozen years ago where I tried to buy most of thier films, at least the classics.  This film must not have been available, because I don't recall having seen it.

And, I'm sure I would have remembered it had I seen it.  This is, in my view, the best film Jess Franco ever did.  The heavy, Gothic vibe just saturates this work.  The sound track, the warmly muted colors, the haunting atmosphere of this will completely transport you to Europe and London on the 1800s.  Very powerful vintage ambience, with great performances by all, and you obviously have some greatest actors of the horror genre in here. Just look at the legendary names!!  And, the rest of the production is commensurate in quality.

Perhaps even more important, this is the most loyal rendition ever of the Dracula franchise.  This film is astonishingly faithful to Bram Stoker's book, where it all started.  This is unexpected and amusing, because I think of Jess Franco as a director who is far from faithful to any convention.  But this film immediately reminded me of the original Dracula novel, and the way Franco presents it here is exactly the way I envisioned the story in my mind as I read it many years ago.

Conclusion:  This is an absolute must-have for any horror film collection or any connisseur of Dracula or vampire lore. Disregard the other mediocre reviews: This film is a certified masterpiece.",1480723200,3,1554,4.686346863468635
