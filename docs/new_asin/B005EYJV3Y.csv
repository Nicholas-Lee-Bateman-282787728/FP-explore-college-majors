4670037,4,B005EYJV3Y,"Longhorns is a sexy gay comedy that is unlike most, in that it actually has far more heterosexual characters than homosexual characters. But it still can be categorized as a gay movie, since the two main characters are gay, even though one of them doesn't realize it until late in the movie. There is a sweet romance among all of the comedic moments, and there are a couple of scenes that tug at the heartstrings. Oh, and the nudity. Good God, the nudity. There are five full frontal scenes. All the male actors in the cast show their ""longhorns"". And Dylan Vox is hilarious in the role of Steve. Everytime he's on screen, be prepared to laugh. Longhorns isn't the best of its type to be released this year (I liked Eating Out: Drama Camp more), but it's still well worth watching if you're gay or just ""curious"".",1321488000,93,813,4.5
4670038,4,B005EYJV3Y,"longhorns was a nice movie. Was it groundbreaking cinema? No. Was it ever intended to be in the Oscar race? No. It's a cute gay love story about life in the closet in the 80's. It is short (clocking in at only 75 minutes), but that just means you don't have to worry about any slow points. in actuality i think they could have used about fifteen more minutes in the middle before Jacob Newton's character went running off to the cabin in the woods with his high school buddies, but that's just me.  The acting was above average for low-budget indie. The chemistry between the characters was (mostly) believable. Derek Efrain Villanueva is wonderful, and i fell for him almost as quickly as Jacob Newton did in the movie. WELL worth the rental, and i will be buy a copy for myself as well.",1321401600,46,788,4.43448275862069

The actor playing main character Kevin, a young Billy Bob Thornton look-alike, does a great job of playing a good ol' boy coming to terms with his sexual orientation in 1980s Texas.

4670072,5,B005EYJV3Y,"""Longhorns"" is one of the most endearingly charming and entertaining independent films featuring gay production and talent that ever I have seen. (It also is known by the alternative title, ""Sexy Buffalo Boys"".) The budget for the project, obviously, was limited, but no large-scale effects or artificial settings were required, so a lot of money was not needed (or probably even desirable).

Jacob Newton, as Kevin, is a real cutie, coltishly exuberant and sensuously irresistible, perfectly cast in the central role of one truly oversexed young dude, good at bedding the college women, but also, it turns out, even better in bed with the lads (as his gay instincts especially draw him into arousing them at groin level so skillfully by mouth or hand), as he repeatedly finds out to his confused chagrin. Newton's talents as well as his looks, dressed or full-frontally buck-naked, are utterly perfect for the role. As such an erotically mega-charged undergrad college boy, surprised by where his feelings and inclinations, in situations of delicious hilarity, take him, no better casting could be desired! It is very pleasing, as well, that Newton is a native Southerner (in real life hailing from Louisville, Ky.), which helps to make his spoken dialogue to sound so natural in this 2011 film's 1982 Texas setting. And Derek Efrain Villanueva, as Csar, is the perfect foil for Newton, a very different kind of young gay dude, one who is very confident in his homosexuality but is alike of more sleekly delicate physique, and of more innately refined sensibilities, than the taller and varyingly more robust young men in the cast who surround him.

The two protagonists, though so different, were destined for each other! And that is how things turn out, too. This little film is destined for a gay man's utter enjoyment! Although I acquired the DVD only rather recently, I have watched it several times, with ever greater delight.",1396224000,7,1933,5.0375

4670079,4,B005EYJV3Y,"I saw this movie and I figured that it would be a corny movie about bisexual and gay men as most movies in this genre are not that good.  It was not as bad as I thought it was going to be and it had bisexual and gay male characters in it, and it accurately portrays what it was like to be a bisexual or gay man in the very early 80s before AIDS was known about.

What more can you ask for?",1384560000,,356,4.53125
4670082,3,B005EYJV3Y,"This film has the production values of a documentary, not a budgeted film.  I am wondering if it might have been a college project or something.

4670114,3,B005EYJV3Y,"This could have been a really good movie, but it wore out its one-joke theme - straight guys who love nothing better than masturbating together while watching porn - about the third time it played out. That may be a powerful and persistent fantasy and an infallible source of amusement for lots of gay men, but it's not for me, and watching it in a movie gets old very fast. It wasn't even remotely believable the first time it happened, and it got less believable every time.

The second recurring theme has one man stripping completely naked and standing still for another, fully clothed man to ogle. Each of the five main characters did it once each, with another of the five (two, in one instance) as the clothed ogler. Was that supposed to be funny too, or was it just an extremely clumsy way to get as much full frontal (but as sterile as a nun) nudity as possible into the movie?

So the movie is almost unbearably contrived, stupid and unfunny. It has two redeeming strengths, though.

Three of the main cast members are genuine Southerners who talk with real Southern accents, not the Hollywood fake-Southern accents non-Southern actors always affect (even Meryl Streep can't get it right) in movies. Non-Southerners must not be able to tell the difference, but I can, and as a long-time transplant to the North, hearing people who talk like me on screen warms my heart and points out how very, very rarely it happens. Even Southern actors almost never use their native accents in movies, which is sad.

The movie's other strength is the cast, particularly Derek Villanueva and Dylan Vox, who shine (Jacob Newton, though sort of cute, is a little weak as the lead). I wish someone would remake Longhorns with the same cast but as a serious movie, not a very lame, very unfunny comedy.",1341619200,5,1793,4.6645569620253164
4670115,4,B005EYJV3Y,"I first encountered Longhorns at the Chicago Reeling Festival in the fall of 2011 but waited until I finally bought the film before presenting my review. As my review title says, Wonderful, and Funny, Heartening, Romantic, and a ton more adjectives. Having myself survived the era in which this film is intended to portray, I can vouch for the accurate confusion of the main character. In that era it often took a young man quite some time to come to grips with being a homosexual; upon ""coming out"" their self-respect would be devoured as society did not want to deal with ""queers"", thus only the brave (or stupid) allowed their sexual preference to become known (if they themselves even knew). But writer/director David Lewis has appropriately interlaced drama with humor to give us an accurate vision of that time. The two main characters, Kevin (Jacob Newton) & Cesar (Derek Efrain Villanueva) give us a wonderful indication of the difficulties of the time, with Cesar being ""out"" and Kevin being ""closeted"". I must admit that I was quite surprised to see Dylan Vox cast in a heterosexual role, albeit a rather disquieting heterosexual; but true to form, Dylan brings the humor necessary to endear the audience to the character. The remaining supporting cast gives realism to the drama, vision to the romance, and laughs to the humor. To sum up; Longhorns is a well written, superbly directed and exceptionally acted portrayal in the early 1980's of a young man coming to terms with his sexuality through friends , romance and love; although some of it is rather surrogate from his friends. If you're looking to be entertained, this production will not fall short of that goal.",1341619200,,1681,4.901754385964912
4670116,4,B005EYJV3Y,"I was surprised that the movie turned out as good as it did.  I was very pleased.  Back in 1982 it was difficult to come out and people got married despite being gay, but this movie breaks that mold and tells a good story, with good casting and acting.

4670118,3,B005EYJV3Y,"It's a cute - albeit unrealistic - movie, the acting is mostly acceptable though of course there's better. The production and story leave a little bit to be desired, but anyone who takes this too seriously is missing the point in my opinion.  I have to give them some credit for not using anyone who is gorgeous - no one is bad looking of course, but more like typical everyday people. All the characters end up being at least somewhat likeable and for what it is, I think it's worth viewing. And there's nudity!  and loud gloriously fake sex scenes!

His eventual boy friend is also expertly played, with the remaining cast equaly well done.

I found myself laughing out loud several times during the video; and I also made use of the pause button pretty often.
Dylan Vox (or whatever name he's using this time) is not one of my favorites; there is something unfortunate about his voice and his smile that sounds (to me) like he's sneering all the time.  And the young Latino who unwittingly causes the confusion is probably one of the weaker actors.  But no one stunk up the joint.  I felt like it was Eating Out: Barbeque and Beer.  Naked boys making me laugh (and not because they're naked...) sounds like a waste of time that you can forgive yourself for.",1331683200,,782,4.47887323943662

4670126,1,B005EYJV3Y,"A cast of unexciting, not especially good-looking actors, most of whom would not make the cut in an audition for a high school play, certainly complement the mediocre, sophomoric story.

All the indoor scenes appear to have been shot in various rooms of a $5 a night motel and one suspects their rental expense probably consumed most of the production budget.

The standard over-worked components of a gay-themed movie, homophobia, state of denial and self-revelation, are played out awkwardly, are totally unbelievable and generate no emotion other than acute embarrassment for all concerned, especially the viewer.

This might have been cutting-edge 40 years ago, but these days there is no shortage of well written, superbly acted and beautifully produced movies dealing with all aspects of gay life. This oeuvre is to 21st century gay-themed movies what Amos & Andy would be to modern Black cinematic entertainment.

Even worse, it appears to have been mistakenly labeled a comedy. The comedic highlights include: (a)One of the characters has given names to his three house plants and (b) The same character unintentionally wears blue jeans on Wear Blue Jeans if You're Gay Day. I hope revealing that didn't spoil the hilarity for anyone.

Don't bother.",1329264000,,1257,5.202970297029703
4670127,4,B005EYJV3Y,"Another gay comedy, I know there have been so many but as May West once said `too much of a good thing can be wonderful'. This is based in the dark days of 1982 when it was still cool to be homophobic and absolutely de rigueur in some places - like school work or out in public. We are introduced to jock boy Jacob Newton who plays Kevin. He is busily proving his macho credentials by sleeping with all the cheerleaders, so we have bedroom squelch pretty early on. The thing is he is fantasising that she .... wait for it, is a he! He also has pet names for his house plants - another hugely masculine and heterosexual trait (so I am told!)

Then along comes Cesar (pronounced Sayzar - pretentious I know) played by Derek Efrain Villanueva (a bit of a mouthful that - actually that might be a simile for the film). Along with studying Willa Cather, he also agrees to do some nude posing for art class good boy Kevin. Well things get out of hand (that happened to me once actually) and Kevin decides to run off for a weekend of frat male bonding and video porn with the likes of `Cindy does SINcinatti' (for those who haven't seen it, the production values are woeful).

This film has some laugh out loud moments and does not rely on the gross out humour that often besmirches, what could have been a funny film. There is some nudity, but not when it comes to the boudoir. There are fashion faux pas a plenty lots of great jock one liners and more than a couple of oninism episodes (do it yourself hand action). Dylan Vox as Steve is pretty hunky and seems to have never visited wardrobe which I did not mind about at all and all the stereo types get challenged.

Though made on a small budget it wears its heart on its sleeve and was a really enjoyable movie. It is not a laugh fest, high cinema or particularly challenging, but it put me in a good mood hence the rating. Director David Lewis has done an excellent job, I thought the soundtrack could have been better, but then I am a music snob, and copyright laws are a real pain in America. If you like gay cinema and your sense of humour juices are easy to get flowing, then give it a go.",1327104000,6,2142,4.245098039215686
4670128,1,B005EYJV3Y,"After reading the reviews that are posted most prominently here I thought this would be an enjoyable couple of hours spent - nothing too great, but fun, and sexy, and nice.
Well, noon of those apply. It is not fun - it is painful (acting writing, production quality).
Not sexy - these guys are just not that interesting to look at (full frontal on all of them only goes so far, and with a couple of them, not at all far enough), nor do we want to hear what they have to say - back to bad dialog and weak acting.
Not nice - the story is lame, and characters cardboard - and let's face it, in 1982, NONE of that would have happened. The out guy would have been chased off campus, or worse, and the others would have stayed firmly in their closets. A couple of hours I won't get back. Good idea to read all the reviews posted - not just the positive ones they put up for first view",1326844800,5,878,4.08092485549133

4670130,4,B005EYJV3Y,"Most coming-out movies are either unrealistically cheery or overwhelming depressing. This is well-nuanced middle ground set in 1982. If you can look past the soft-core porn aspects, the misleading cover image  and some of the heavy handed see-this-is-Texas touches, the story is compelling and deft, for the most part. The real story is not in the sex, but three young men coming to terms with their sexual identities in the early 80s. There's awkwardness and fear here, and to the credit of the film makers, they are not obscured by cheesy, cheap cliches.  The atmospherics of life in the early 80s are well placed, aside from a few spurious ""awesomes"" dropped (only valley girls were using the term then), and it is a bittersweet snapshot just before the plague. This movie is very good for what it is, and it explores, albeit without much depth, some of the shadowland between ""straight"" and ""gay"" men that we see handled with mastery in ""Gods and Monsters"".",1325980800,,961,4.853658536585366

Like any ""straight"" boy, Kevin freaks out, and quickly heads out to join a couple of his best friends at a country cabin ... where we learn how some of his fantasies got originated.

It's a rather unambitious but entertaining and funny film, by the same writer/director who brought you ""Rock Haven"" and ""Redwoods,"" which had similar vibes. I thought the acting was capable enough, and the gay character, Caesar (Deek Villanueva), was written as non-stereotypical and intelligent.  Unfortunately, the ""straight boy"" characters (which make up most of the cast) didn't fare as well, and were largely portrayed as cartoonish, macho wannabes.

Not rated, but would be rated a heavy R for full frontal nudity and simulated sex.  Extras on the DVD were a bit confusing.  Many of the ""deleted scenes"" were actually in the film, and there is an ""interview"" that is completely unintelligible due to very poor sound.

It takes me back to my college days in the early 80's, and some of what happens in the movie, I KNOW was going on at school, and probably more so today.  All the actors do a really good job, especially Dylan Vox who is hilarious.  And I also like that 'everything' is shown and not edited.  You can tell that it was shot on a small budget and  on a tight schedule, but it's also not meant to be the next 'Brokeback Mountain'.  I've certainly seen much worse filmed indie movies before.
