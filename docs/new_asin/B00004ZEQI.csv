7928556,5,B00004ZEQI,"Great clips from the 1950s and 60s, right from the big CBS theatre just off Times Square. I enjoy listening *and* watching, as the performers arrive on stage in their Opera attire, in many cases: Jan Peerce as Pagliacci, in costume...is almost overwhelming. (Roberta Peters in her early 30s isn't bad, either. Or Eileen Farrell...in Rome)!

I don't care for the cutesy dissolves and the lack of composer's credits. But I won't take away a half-star. Not even for the conspicuous absence of ""Un a furtive lagrima""! (It *had* to have been done at Sullivan's  place!).

We have all the classics by the classics. But...where's Ed? He had fans, too!",1387497600,,644,4.836363636363636
7928557,5,B00004ZEQI,"This is an easy review:
  1) They don't make them like this anymore!
  2) Price, Sills, Sutherland, Moffo, Farrell, Callas, Nilsson...Oh My!'
  3) Corelli, Merrill, Tucker, Peerce ...Wow!
  4) Lest I forget Tebaldi, Pons, Kirsten, Peters, Horne ALL IN THEIR PRIME singing some of their greatest arias, most in color a few in B&W.  Good to very good sound.  All seen on our TV sets on Sunday Evening ... FREE!!!
  5)  TWO GLORIOUS HOURS!!!
  6)  Don't miss this oportunity to hear and see some of the greatest opera artists we ever had.  Also, there is more in  the vaults and other  great DVDs from this iconoclastic showman: Ed Sullivan.  I wish I could dub in BYE BYE BIRDIE's ""Hymn For A Sunday Evening.""  ""Ed Sullivan... we're going to be on Ed Sullivan... I love you Ed.""
  7)  One really must hear Robert Merrill's ""Largo al fatotum.""  Rossini must be rolling on the golden streets of heaven in Hysterical Laughter over the new broadway show biz orchestration.  A REAL HOOT!!!  Where did they find this?  AND IS THIS A NEW HISTORICALLY INFORMED JUST DISCOVERED EDITION!!!
  8) I got it used on Amazon and it was worth every penny!",1351382400,3,1136,4.619289340101523
7928558,4,B00004ZEQI,"This video is just what it says it is - a bit of history. A chance to hear some really wonderful singers under some very unusual circumstances. I fine it interesting that many of you have taken to opportunity to act like you are on YouTube and have overlooked an important error while you argue about F or F#. Just listen and enjoy or don't. BTW - The titles on the DVD and your reviews miss an important error: Dame Joan does sing an aria from Lucia but it is not ""Quando rapito in estasi"" but rather ""Ardon gl'incensi!"" the mad scene",1266105600,,535,4.254901960784314
7928559,4,B00004ZEQI,"In most cases, yes, great moments, not all 'should'  be considered great Opera.  WELL worth the purchase however IF you can find it.  As to the Roberta Peters debate, F# or high F ... who cares, the tone and musicality was way off base, she may be a soprano, but a coloratura she is not!  She was all over the place in ""Una voce pocco fa"".. it was painful to listen to (but then you have got to remember that Rudolf Bing ran the Met during her time .. need I remind you he was a floorwalker in a British department store before running the Met, his taste was suspect to say the LEAST! he proved a tin ear more than once!) ... I'm with you, too on Eillen Farrell.. there was a reason she was the ""Crossover Queen"", that is the area her voice was more suited to perform.  Rewind, forward or next track to Beverly Sills' ""O luce di quest' anima"" to hear true coloratura ~ Worth your purchase price alone!",1186185600,2,901,4.184971098265896
7928560,5,B00004ZEQI,"The two reviewers who commented in reponse to the reviewer from Baltimore do not really demonstrate much knowledge about opera.  That's great that Eileen Farrell has such a notable career outside of opera, but that says nothing for her actual operatic ability.  I, too, find her singing lackluster and her appearance and acting ability unsatisfying.  It makes me wonder what made the reviewer from Indiana think that he knew so much about opera when the only thing he can write about is POP MUSIC!  Please learn more about Maria Callas's contribution to opera before you make naive comments such as that she only mastered one area.  You are doing yourself a disservice by not even attempting to appreciate how she single-handedly revived Bel Canto in the 50's and completely changed the way we listen to opera until today.  You would, on the other hand, be pressed to find a single recording of any opera with Eileen Farrell on the shelves today, even at larger specialty classical music stores.  It is also worth noting that the orchestra is tuned sharp on this recording of Rossini with Roberta Peters.  I don't know which piano this review was plucking on, but it must be flat.  Peters's high note is closer to an F# than an F.",1139443200,3,1230,4.737089201877934
7928561,4,B00004ZEQI,"The extremely verbose reviewer previously attempted to show a great deal of knowledge, but really didn't know much - It has already been noted that Peters' high note is truly F natural - while the aria is historically written in E Major (which would have an F# on the 2nd tone of the scale, which still wouldn't be the tonic of the piece), almost all coloratura sopranos who attempt the role transpose it to F major - and the high F natural is then standard in that case.

As for his comments on Eileen Farrell - he's truly completely off track.  Not only was Farrell's one of the finest American soprano instruments ever, people still DO listen to her - her career spanned from the early 1940s until the middle 1990s (when she released several pop/jazz recordings).  She's known as the Queen of Crossover, having had her own radio show on CBS in the 1940s and a HUGE concert career.  She came to opera late (in her 40s) and still was a huge success.  While Callas' name may be more ""well-known"" in the opera world, Farrell had, and continues to have her beat in concert, symphonic, popular, television, showtunes, etc.  Farrell did it all - Callas did one thing, and certainly made the best of a mediocre instrument, and was probably a better actress than Farrell, but she was a joke comparatively in terms of natural ability.  This recording of Pace Pace in this video is VERY odd, indeed, but only because it was recorded in Italy for the Spoleto Festival, in the 1950s - on the same trip, she took over for an ill Louis Armstrong, singing swing standards with his band!  It was played on the Sullivan show, but wasn't filmed in the studio - hence the odd background.  Farrell wasn't a supermodel, and truly didn't care what others thought of her - but it's best for those who don't know what they're talking about to not talk.  I purchased this video years ago ONLY BECAUSE it DID have excerpts featuring Farrell.  Many of the other excerpts are quite enjoyable - but must be taken for what they are and the time in which they were filmed.",1133481600,7,2043,4.509485094850948
7928562,5,B00004ZEQI,"I urge anyone who has an opinion to go ahead and DO pay attention to some of the other reviews written about this compilation of operatic excerpts.  They can be helpful!  The enjoyment of music, and hence the determination of good and entertaining music, is HIGHLY subjective.  The previous reviewer thus really got a lot of nerves to tout himself as an all-knowing opera expert, dismissing other people's reviews just because they are not as knowledgeable. In fact this reviewer himself spouts some ""blatantly false"" information.  For one, Roberta Peter's high note ending ""Una Voce Poco Fa"" IS INDEED a high F, NOT F#.  You need to be quite tone-deaf to designate that note as an F#.  Pluck out the note on a piano, my friend.  He also says that Joan Sutherland's high E-flat in ""Sempre Libera"" is squeezed out!  It's the biggest sounding high note (above high C) tossed off in the whole of this DVD compilation (however there's a younger Joan in the Lucia piece, with freer high notes)!  He praises Roberta Peters through the roof (and justly so, because she IS good), yet Roberta's high notes are positively puny compared to Dame Joan's.  Joan's got a naturally bigger voice and hence bigger high notes than Roberta.  And you CAN hear the difference.

What got to me was NOT that the previous reviewer had strong opinions; he's completely entitled to them.  What got to me was him saying everyone else's reviews are worthless because they are not the self-proclaimed opera expert as he is!  So I urge all you folks to form your own opinions, even post them, only respect others as well!",1127347200,6,1590,4.734545454545454
7928563,4,B00004ZEQI,"I left off a star because of the shoddy (hasty?, indifferent?) production of this DVD.  It delivers the goods, but.  No subtitles, though the performers are gesturing and acting their arias.  No dates given for the performances (worse than not having subtitles).  In the 2nd half, about 2/3 of the annoucements of who was about to sing what left the name of the opera off.  For the price ($40) for a single 2 hour DVD (the movie Amadeus runs over 3 hours and costs about $15), this was inexcusable.  Clearly someone just slapped together a lot of old TV clips the quickest way they could, put the thing in a box and stuck an outrageous price on it.  That's the bad part.  The good part speaks for itself.  Look who's singing (what they're singing is warhorses, but you can see why they became warhorses), and they all sang perfectly.  It was glorious and beautiful, I loved it, watched the last half yesterday, and will watch it many times.  A few personal observations.  It's a cruel twist that Pons was born so soon, what splendor to have that voice today when it could be preserved.  The reviewer who crucified Callas (frankly, honestly) took the words right out of my mouth.  This DVD put the last nail in the coffin of my love for her.  She was a viciously cruel person (enough right there), I know, I have a recording of her talking, her looks are beside the point (too silly to discuss), her voice is very unpleasant to hear and she simply cannot act, though the way some people still go on, you'd think she was the only soprano who could!  I discovered opera though an LP set of hers in 1967, I have almost all her recordings, and my love is now dead.  Sutherland (phooey on the same reviewer who gave Callas the axe) was glorious, particularly in the fragment from Lucia.  Where were the microphones in that boring outdoor scene with Farrell (and was the applause canned)?  The disc overflows with coloratura (which I love), though there's some Verdi, Puccini and verismo (opera's death knell) too.  I had a gift card so it didn't cost me any $, but having seen it and heard it, I would have paid it, I think.  All these other reviewers (except the one) certainly loved it.",1095379200,8,2182,4.5012722646310435
7928564,5,B00004ZEQI,"The DVD, Great Moments in Opera, features famous opera singers singing arias that made them famous. It is broken up into two volumes, and some singers are featured more than once. All in all, there are selections from many different operas, although they are all Italian. Because of this, the Italian singer Franco Corelli was the most natural with singing this kind of opera, and even sung a traditional Italian song called ""Tu Lo Sai.""

  The aria ""Un bel di"" from Madame Butterfly by Puccini was performed twice. The first performance, by Dorothy Kirsten, was taken from an older film, but it featured an appropriate stage set, a Japanese bridge over a pond.  The second, by Eileen Farrell, although being filmed more recently, had a background that was composed of butterflies on sticks in order that the viewer be aware that Madame Butterfly was singing. Both singers were very good.

  The singer Birgit Nilsson was shown twice. She was definitely an accomplished bel canto singer as was Franco Corelli. She was able to achieve clear tonality even in the high registers.

  Robert Merrill was shown a few times, and at the end of the DVD, he sung three duets from Verdi operas. In one aria he sang incredibly quickly, a very difficult task.

  An interesting selection previewed Eileen Farrell singing a Verdi aria. It was interesting because she was positioned out in the middle of some ancient Roman or Grecian ruins with a pianist to accompany her instead of on a stage with an orchestra background.

  The duet `Mira, O Norma"" from Norma was performed by Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne. Although both singers were sopranos, they were able to achieve clarity and variety in their singing. They definitely matched each other's voices perfectly.

  The aria `Vesti le guiba"" from I Pagliacci was sung by Richard Tucker. In accordance with the opera, he dressed as a clown and even had to deal with a couple props. He was able to sing well and act at the same time.

  Roberta Peters was a singer who was especially talented with singing in the high register. This was evidenced by the fact that in each of the arias that she sang the ending displayed a brilliantly high cadenza.

  A rather amusing part of the DVD was when Lily Pons sung ""Gavotte"" from Mignon. She was seated in a type of fairy tale garden in which there were lily ponds( a sort of derivation off of her name). Once she even looked into a lily pond in accordance with the action that went with what she was singing.

  All in all Great Moments in Opera is a good summery of highlights of Italian opera and of famous singers. The name of each singer and the piece that they sing is given so that everything is featured in a good order. This is a well put together, informative, and entertaining DVD to watch.",1093046400,4,2785,4.651639344262295
7928565,4,B00004ZEQI,"Memories of Ed's ""really big shooooe"" may summon up images of Topo Giggio and Senor Wences, but Sullivan was primarily known for presenting the best talent from the New York stage, including night club, Broadway, and opera.  This DVD gives us 2 hours of headliners primarily from the Met performing arias and duets from roles that they performed in New York.  Most of these selections seem to be from the 60's (no dates are identified), and a few seem to be from the 50's.  Almost all are performed concert-style (without sets and costumes).
Some of the most compelling segments are Callas' Vissi d'arte (Tosca) and Lily Pons' Gavotte (Mignon), two of the few selections filmed with costumes and sets.  Callas' dramatic gifts are legendary, and Pons proves to be dramatically effective in her own way, singing and moving with ease and charm.  Even at this late point in her career, she generates a lot of excitement.  Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne trill together in Mira o Norma, and Sutherland solos in Sempre libera (Traviata) and Quando rapita (Lucia).  A young Beverly Sills brings her considerable coloratura skills to O luce di quest' anima (Linda di Chamounix).  Richard Tucker gives a moving rendition of Vesti la giubba (Pagliacci), and Anna Moffo is captivating in Il regimento (Daugher of the Regiment) and La Ballatella (Pagliacci).
Roberta Peters and Robert Merrill seem to have been frequent guests, and they certainly know how to connect with Sullivan's audience.  Peters sings arias from The Barber of Seville, Traviata, Lakme, and Gounod's Romeo and Juilet, and Merrill sings arias and duets from The Barber of Seville, Forza, Traviata, and a medley of arias from Aida, Traviata, and Carmen.  I was somewhat disappointed with Dorothy Kirsten, a long-time favorite of mine.  Famed for her Puccini heroines, she sings Un bel di (Butterfly) and partners with Franco Corelli for Soave fanciulla (Boheme), but neither piece shows her at her best.
There are several repeats.  We get three renditions of Vissi d'arte (Callas, Leontyne Price, and Birgit Nilsson), two of Un bel di (Dorothy Kirsten and Eileen Farrell), and two of Pace pace mio dio (Nilsson and Farrell).  Farrell sings Pace pace mio dio (Forza) with commitment and passion, but an overly arty visual concept proves rather distracting.
Many of these selections are excellent, and it is exciting to see some of the Met's best singers of the 50's and 60's.",981331200,66,2433,5.022388059701493
