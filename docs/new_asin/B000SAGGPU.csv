2884065,5,B000SAGGPU,This DVD is easy to watch--each chapter of Lucado's book is summarized in a five minute or less movie clip.  You can watch one or all of the chapters and feel the flicker of hope that John 3:16 offers.  There is also a short story on this DVD about a prodigal daughter and her coming back to her daddy.  A great gift to give anyone.,1199577600,7,332,4.076923076923077

Generally everyone loved the film and especially the short story included on the DVD. Some had tears. Max Lucado is a goos word-smith and is interesting to listen to",1196899200,8,604,10.0
8204988,4,B000SAGGPU,The condition of the DVD was as advertised and there were no problems in using it with the hardback and small-group study books.  Worth the price...,1506902400,,148,4.6923076923076925

8204994,5,B000SAGGPU,You can't go wrong with Max Lucado books or DVD's. He just has a way with words that makes it so simple to understand.,1363564800,,118,3.9583333333333335
8204995,5,B000SAGGPU,"The only potential negative thing about this production was that it got a little repetitive (but not to the point of being distracting).
I have had a Christian upbringing,though. The repetitiveness of the verse would be very, very meaningful if a nonbeliever was first considering the impact of Jesus' sacrifice for us.
Really, if you need a little ""soul pick me up"" or are feeling disillusioned, grab a work by Max Lucado. You can't put it down and still feel hopeless.",1356998400,2,470,4.814814814814815
8204996,5,B000SAGGPU,"I have watched this video at least a dozen times and each time I take something different away with me. Any time I am feeling worn out, sad, depressed, or even when feeling good. I highly recommend owning this dvd.",1316304000,2,214,4.375
8204997,5,B000SAGGPU,"If you are new to Max Lucado, this is an excellent introduction to him.  If you are familiar with him, this is an excellent way to hear him give an abridged version of his book of the same title. Though this DVD may seem to be more directed to those who do not know Christ as their personal Lord & Savior, it also is a way for those who do to see John 3:16 in a whole new light. I have watched at least three times, already.

  How many times have we read this verse and really not see what all the implications of that verse means? Max takes the verse, word by word, and shows how much GOD really loves us, EVERYONE of us.  There is not one individual, in this world, that this verse does not apply.  Max calls this verse ""The Hope Diamond"" of the Bible. Read the verse and substitute your name in place of ""whosoever"" and it still is 100% scriptural.  Whosoever means every single one of us and GOD loved us so much that HE sent HIS only begotten SON to keep each and everyone of us from perishing, if only we would accept such an invaluable GIFT.  If you have a hard time sitting down reading a book, take about an hour and watch this DVD.  I think in that short time you will find that it was an hour worth while and it may bring you hope and see who GOD and Jesus really are, and that they truley love and care for you.",1263600000,3,1324,4.022900763358779
