1624573,5,B00005M2E2,"Riders of Destiny, 1933 film

This early movie features ""Singing Sandy"", the original character for John Wayne (it didn't last). George Hayes and Al St. John are also in the cast. Lafe McKee usually played villains. A man on a white horse sees a man afoot. The Sheriff was shot in the back. The driver on a stagecoach shoots the rider of a horse. ""Are you hurt, Miss?"" He will help by letting her use his horse to get back to town. Two men provide some comedy. We learn what that woman did. The stagecoach continues on its way. Two riders talk to the men driving the stagecoach. A hidden passenger hears their conversation. Miss Denton reports her stolen horse. Will the Sheriff come back? Sandy brings Miss Denton back to her ranch. Mr. Saunders is thanked for helping Miss Denton. Three men ride up to return Miss Denton's saddle. They see the white horse in the barn.

Sheriff Phil Baxter disappeared, like his predecessor. ""He was a fine man."" Kincaid wants to buy up all the land for $1 an acre. He owns the water rights to Lost Creek, the main water supply for Antelope Valley. The ranchers object to Kincaid's policies, they will appeal to the government. Kincaid tells them he will charge four times more when the present contract expires. Two men plan a trap for Saunders; it backfires. They are taken for a ride back to town; this sends a message to Kincaid. Saunders delivers a letter found on the road. It is illegal to divert a stream. Saunders rides to town. Kincaid orders his water turned off to other people. What can the people do? The people hope for a man from Washington to fix the problem. Saunders sings after supper. [A double? Who really played that guitar?]

A water tank is filled at Denton's well. They will stick with their neighbors. Kincaid will make an offer Denton can't refuse. Two men attack the driver of that water wagon, he is shot. Saunders rides to the rescue. [Another man performs an incredible trick, one that is repeated in other movies.] People cheer when the water wagon arrives in town. [This should make you appreciate piped-in water.] Kincaid has a plan to get rid of Saunders: he orders him out of town! Kincaid's man Morgan loses. Is ""Singing Sandy"" a notorious gunman? Kincaid wants to hire him as a gunman to protect him; the law is on his side. Sandy offers a suggestion. Miss Denton overhears the talk! Kincaid gives an order to his men. The ranchers ask for a new clause in their contract; Kincaid agrees. [Is there a trick here?]

Saunders arrives at the Denton's ranch. Blowing up the well recreates a water supply for the creek! Saunders explains he was sent by Washington to help the people. [Some things never change?] The rancher signed the contract, Kincaid's water flows to the ranchers. Cattle get their water. Geese and ducks swim in the water. Sheriff Baxter returns in good health. Kincaid has lost is water and his land to the community. He takes his revenge. [A poor manager blames his subordinates.] Denton reveals Saunders' identity: the Man from Washington. Saunders pursues Kincai until he falls. Saunders will return to see Miss Denton.

Note how these people wanted help from Washington for their economic problems. That tells you something about the politics of that era. John Wayne seems to be quite comfortable as an operative from big government against a local big landowner

1624576,4,B00005M2E2,funny because of it's age...but a wonderful movie.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants a chuckle and a clean movie,1369872000,,121,4.5
1624577,3,B00005M2E2,"Early John Wayne  B movies vary in quality. The Synergy print is one of the better prints, since everything I have reviewed is of less quality(sound / picture).",1276473600,,160,4.714285714285714
1624578,3,B00005M2E2,"This movie is remarkable in several ways:
1) dubbed sound track for the singing
2) the California Water rights theme
John Wayne never again let them fake his voice after this.
This movie was before he became an international star.
The L.A. Antelope valley/ Kern county water wars are part of California history and were heating up again when I was a boy in the late 50's with the construction of a dam.
We are again in a water shortage period with the desert communities on the short end of the list.
So the several movies about the California water problem in the early 1900's are important historically as well as fun as westerns.
All the LA county/ Orange county citrus ranches had a price to other communities in water.",1247184000,,723,4.569230769230769
1624579,4,B00005M2E2,"This DVD offers a pair of the Lone Star/Monogram westerns that a young John Wayne made in 1933-35. ""Riders of Destiny"" was the first of those poverty row westerns and is of additional historical value because this is John Wayne as a singing cowboy. Granted, the singing is dubbed by Bill Bradbury, one of the twin sons of writer-director Robert North Bradbury (although since there is no official credit the matter remains a disputed issue), but still, you have to admit it is a rather mind boggling notion, like how the title really has anything to do with the plot.

 In this 1933 film Wayne stars as Singin' Sandy Saunders, who also happens to be a government agent. James Kincaid (Forrest Taylor) has taken control of the water in the area and is willing to grant water rights to other ranchers at exorbitant rates. One of those being exploited is the lovely Fay Denton (Cecilia Parker), so Sandy takes a special shine to her. Meanwhile he plans on sinking Kincaid's operation by opening up a lost river and sending the bad guy to a rather ironic but richly deserved fate. Our hero also does some pretty fancy shooting in the requisite gunfight near the end.

 In ""Lucky Texan"" (1934), Wayne plays Jerry Mason, who partners up with the old friend of his father, Jake ""Grandy"" Benson (Hayes) on a gold strike. But as they work their claim in secret the local accessor, Harris (Lloyd Whitlock) and his henchman Joe Cole (Yakima Canutt), are trying to find out where the strike is so they can kill the old man. This one also has a rather funny chase scene that involves an early automobile and a railroad handcar, while the Duke is on a horse, that will have you thinking more of the Keystone Cops than John Ford, but it actually sort of works because these are really the sort of films you would want to see at a Saturday matinee.

 Written & directed by Robert N. Bradbury, the prime attraction of ""The Lucky Texan"" is both the young John Wayne before he fully develops his heroic cowboy persona and the stunt work of the legendary Yakima Canutt (the best one is where Mason leaps for a bad guy, misses, falls into a ravine, and ends up catching the guy at the other end). The print copy is less than stellar, but then it was not like they were working with first rate production values to begin with at Lone Star. I keep expecting these to be really bad, but they are more than halfway decent (so far).",1091232000,,2406,4.506880733944954

Wayne certainly looks uncomfortable during the singing parts of ""Riders of Destiny,"" but there is something compelling about watching him try. One thing to remember with these Lone Star Westerns is that the one person who is also well worth watching, when you can spot him, is the famous stuntman Yakima Canutt, who plays one of Kincaid's henchmen. In this one his big stunt would be as Kincaid during the bad guy's death scene. You will also spot George Hayes, who plays Charlie Denton in the early part of his career before he was known as ""Gabby.""",1087948800,3,1665,4.686006825938566

7945243,5,B00005M2E2,"Riding through some mighty bleak country, Singin Sandy Saunders (John Wayne) strums his guitar and howls a mournful tune about the streets soon running with blood.  This gloomy Gus abruptly comes upon a staggering man who drops.  The poor old geezer was back shot!  Sandy quickly ministers to his needs then heads for town.  Bad things are happening in this burg.  An EVIL bad guy (Forrest Taylor as James Kincaid) has the townsfolk pleading for water.  Kincaid owes the water rights and expects everyone to pay up, just as the price is going up.  Dissenters will be shot.  Hes also hoping to buy everyones land on the cheap.  Only one thing could get in his way........Singin Sandy.  He orders him killed.  Sadly, the only henchmen Kincaid could hire are totally inept.  Sandy keeps coming up alive no matter what is thrown at him.  This town is only big enough for one black hat and it isn't going to be Kincaids.

This is funnier than most westerns thanks to comedian Al St. John as henchman Bert.  The inclusion of slapstick was unexpected but greatly appreciated.  As for John Wayne pretending to sing, the film company soon put a stop to that, hiring Gene Autry to replace Wayne as the next singing cowboy.",1487116800,,1212,4.672985781990521

7945247,3,B00005M2E2,This early John Wayne film from 1933 has Wayne staring as a singing lawman called Singin' Sandy. Unfortunately the singing is dubbed in and Wayne does not move his mouth in sync with the words. He arrives in town to help landowners but doesn't reveal his identity. Gabby Hayes has a serious role as one of the landowners who is being persecuted by the villain who won't allow the landowners to use his water unless they pay a huge price.
