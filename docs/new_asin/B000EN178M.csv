8111514,5,B000EN178M,Didn't remember how great Gorgo was and especially the special effects for that time period. If you loved Godzilla and never saw Gorgo---give this classic film a try!,1402531200,,166,4.964285714285714
8111515,3,B000EN178M,"""Gorgo"" was another wonderful ""giant monster"" movie to me when I used to watch it on TV as a kid. Everytime they showed it, I watched it. The last time I saw it was either on TV in the early 80's or on videocassette in the early 90's, as an adult. I was surprised then, to realize how mediocre it really was. But, some old movies that don't hold up to my adult tastes, still have enough nostalgic value for me to enjoy watching them, once in a while.  So, when I found this double feature, plus other nostalgic extras for under a dollar, I couldn't pass it up. I wasn't expecting pristine picture or sound, but I don't care about that. I remember how these old movies looked and sounded on TV back in the 60's, 70's and 80's and am perfectly happy if my dvd copies are no better. I prefer perfection, but don't require it.

The story of ""Gorgo,"" for those not familiar with it: a dinosaur, apparently held in suspended animation for HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of YEARS, is awoken by volcanic heat and is captured, to become the newest attraction in an amusement park. But, oops! Gorgo is a baby dino and it's mother, 100 times larger, or so, strolls across England to retrieve her precious angel. A very large dose of woulda, shoulda, coulda, for the entrepreneurs in this story! Meanwhile, an orphaned boy, who somehow realizes that Gorgo is a just a poor little dino-boy, sympathizes with him and tags along, for the young'ens in the audience.

The reason Gorgo doesn't hold up well, is mostly because the script, or what parts of it made it to the final film, don't tell the story very well. There seem to be big chunks of missing story, plus the boy's connection with ""little"" Gorgo, isn't prominent enough to evoke any emotional connection with the audience. The special effects are hit and miss, but if you expect more than that from an early 60's giant monster movie, you're expecting way too much.

It's in color and the picture and sound are not great, but are OK. Surprisingly the frame ratio looks like it might be original, rather than one cropped for old TV screens.

The second feature is ""The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues,"" a radiation monster movie that's bad enough to make Gorgo"" seem miraculous by comparison.

Story: two guys, for different reasons, bump heads while looking for the cause of mysteriously burned bodies washing up on a beach, and trace them to a large uranium deposit right off the coast and a kindly oceanic science professor and his weird experiments with sea creatures.

While there's the germ of a good story here with plenty of human conflict, the movie never gets close to interesting and wouldn't recognize scary if it jumped out of a closet with a roaring chainsaw. Except for the monster costume, it's not even laughably bad.

Picture and sound are OK.

This collection also includes a very early cartoon, about a weird monster and some commercials that I suspect were shown at children's matinees at the movie theater in the late 50's and early 60's. Anybody remember Remco Toy commercials? This commercial reminds me how crappy some of the toys were that I enjoyed so much.

The perfect second feature might have been ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms.""  ""Gorgo"" is often compared to the English language, Raymond Burr edit of ""Godzilla,"" but I think it's more like ""The Beast...""  However, this collection exists because it's all public domain content, or was when it was released (apparently, someone won and now owns the rights to ""Gorgo""). But if it could be, I'd put those 2 movies together, with ""The Beast..."" first, ""Gorgo"" last and the extras in the middle.

Overall, a bargain priced stroll thru an unimportant block of memory lane.",1325289600,,3679,4.667697063369397
