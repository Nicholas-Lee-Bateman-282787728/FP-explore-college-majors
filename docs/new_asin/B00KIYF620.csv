8659421,4,B00KIYF620,"Lucy is out for revenge. Somewhere out there is a civil servant that did her a great wrong and she has joined the ranks of civil servants in an effort to find him. But being a civil servant isn't an easy job, as she encounters angry citizens, wacky co-workers, and a boss that is a stuffed rabbit.
But she will not lose faith! Lucy Kimiko Akie Airi Shiori Rinne Yoshiho Ayano Tomika Chitose Sanae Mikiko Ichika Yamagami will have revenge on the civil servant that approved her ridiculous name!

Despite the main premise being revenge, this is actually a slice of life romantic comedy. The revenge does tie in, but Lucy spends more time bemoaning her name than actually looking for revenge.

I enjoyed the characters in this show. Despite her clumsiness, Lucy is quite capable and quickly makes herself valuable at work. Saya is the sweet girl whom everyone loves, but isn't too happy with that. Yutaka is the lazy slacker guy, who is amazingly good at doing his job and hits on girls simply to collect their numbers/emails. Together, the three of them and their other whacky co-workers make watching a show about civil servants an entertaining experience.

Most of the show is episodic, but there is the overarching romance plot that I actually really liked and thought was well done and sweet.

Servent x Service is based on a manga of the same name by the author of Wagnaria!!, another working comedy. They are both very similar, mostly through their working style environment and the style of humor, but they are by no means clones of each other.

Servent x Service is 13 episodes long and has a decent ending (so no ""read the light novels/manga to find out what the ending is!""). The manga is still ongoing though.

Buying tip: if you buy this set from RightStuf it is only $59.98, instead of the Amazon price of $88.98. Or you can just watch it on Crunchyroll.",1402963200,10,1865,4.636363636363637
