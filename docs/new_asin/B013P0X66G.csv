7368598,5,B013P0X66G,"This film is great for all ages!! It has something for everyone. I personally helped in making this film, my family and I were extras in the drone race scene. This film is a first of it's kind, it was created by ordinary people who came together to make something extraordinary. Community collabration is an awesome new way to make films. I have made friends around the world because of Rotor Dr1. Sharing ideas and thoughts with the Rotor DR1 community has been a great expierence. Love seeing all the ideas and thoughts that were once words on the forum or fb page become this great film has been priceless.",1445817600,6,609,4.545454545454546

7368791,1,B013P0X66G,"I noted the Trivia info that this was some type of collaborative community process film.  Everybody had their feedback and ideas.  Kind of like a Berne Sanders free for all socialist experiment.  Well. This film is boring and dull and low energy.  There is no discernible vision or plot.  In contrast, take a tyrannical sharp vision director/producer like James Cameron who (1) has a strong well defined vision of his movies and (2) works his and everybody else's butts off to make that vision come alive on screen.  The results show the professional difference.  Is this too harsh a comment to make to an amateur group of young film makers?  No.  If you desire to entertain people and/or share a vision with an audience using film as the messenger, somebody must be in charge to get that done effectively.  This was not a movie but a stringy patchwork of ""so what will we shoot today"" segments. I say this not as thundering criticism but as a way for the true talents in such projects to feel responsible for their work and grab control of theIr dream and fight like hell to make that dream a sharp reality.  Otherwise you've reduced the film making process to an incoherent jumble of disjointed and poorly presented half thoughts.  The best entertainers in any area of the entertainment process are self driven to do their best and would never succumb to a group think process that dilutes vision, energy, and focus.",1511049600,,1418,4.696356275303644

7368841,5,B013P0X66G,"I really enjoyed this film. I was immediately interested to hear about Rotor DR1 when it was released, which was the year I became interested in drones: 2015. A lot of thought and effort went into Rotor DR1's production and it has something rare in movies these days: character development.  Despite its high quality, I read that DR1's  budget was a tiny, tiny fraction of most Hollywood movies. I also read that hundreds of people gave their inputs to steer the storyline.  The drone itself has some subtle human traits, and I relished its little sounds as well as the FPV world we see according to the drone. I also appreciated what Morse code was used for in the movie, as I've used the code to communicate as a ham radio operator since I was 17 (I'm now 44 :-) )  There's even a horse in the beginning of the movie, and I was the steward of one for 4 years. I will watch DR1 again!",1510012800,2,885,4.313253012048193

7368969,1,B013P0X66G,"WOW was I silly to pay to watch this!

Only had a few reviews on Amazon, but then I saw the IMDb rating, and thought, it must not be that bad.

This movie is terrible. If I were watching it for free, or at an extreme reduced rate I might not be so irritated that I  rented this for the same price as real block buster films released from Hollywood .

It is so bad, that after paying for it, I am not interested in continuing to watch this. Even though I wasted a considerable amount of money on it.

They are in a post apocalyptic world, and the main charcter has been living in this world for years, yet has no street smarts at all. There is this scene were to thugs are picking on this kid, and he just stands out in the open, stupidly gawking at the scene.

He walks around like he is totally unaware of his surroundings. In a world like that, the kid wouldn't last a second.

Second scene that is irritating. The kids are walking through the city. They see a house, and just leave their stuff at the open doorway. Surprise surprise some other desperate people steal it. Even in today's world if your kid left the door open, or just left their stuff unsecured in your suburbs, you would have a stern word for them.

Pay attention at the end of the movie, you may will catch what I did, it doesn't seem the danger was though out fully when writing this movie. The video description is a little false, ""survivors struggle to rebuild""  there was no rebuilding of anything, mostly theft and greed and ""Autonomous drones, originally meant to deliver vaccinations for the deadly disease, now wander aimlessly through the sky and are hunted for their parts and power sources. "". The only thing happen to the drones is that they get hunted and knocked down immediately if discovered. However, it still a good move to watch!",1533686400,,760,4.649253731343284
8728301,4,B013P0X66G,"This was an interesting movie.  I enjoyed it.  The idea that drones would be autonomously running after a plague and would serve as a resource to the survivors, like another form of wildlife was a fascinating concept.  The scenery and the wrecked buildings looked great.  I also thought the drone's name was kind of a clever little joke.

There were a few things that didn't make much sense.  For instance, why didn't someone just figure out where the drones were based and harvest them all?  With so few survivors and, one assumes, so much leftover stuff, why would trade flourish at all?  How could the local strong man who knew everyone not know who the doc's son was?  They were obviously in contact via radio and the doc could see his son with the drone, soooo why not just call the strong man to pick him up?  Why didn't the doc just put a note on the drone and send it to the kid to explain what was going on and what to do?  That would have saved a whole lot of time in this story.  Why did these kids, who had survived the collapse of civilization, not have any idea of security or street smarts?  That would seem kind of important.  And why did everyone stay at the lab all those years?

Overall, I liked it.  There were aspects of it, like the gauss gun, that reminded me of Fallout.  The story was interesting and it was a different take on a post-A story.  I would recommend this one and I would watch it again.  Also- interestingly, this was a relatively non-violent movie, for the end of the world.",1531353600,2,1513,4.339285714285714

I think this movie had a unique concept in using viewer input to help shape the movie, and help with the dialogue.  I like that a lot of the Flite Test folks make appearances in the movie as well.
