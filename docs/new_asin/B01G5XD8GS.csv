7756099,5,B01G5XD8GS,"This is a great ""family"" oriented series full of fun and great character depiction.  I love it!

As I said before Amazon not only cares about the merchandise they sell, they care about the person who tells them about a problem
I had my boxing gloves on because I expected a fight to get my money back when the package was taken from my mail box. There are a number of frustrating ways you could have handled this but what? Amazon chose to do the right thing. They believed the customer and they refunded the money in spite of the crazy circumstances that led up to it.  I'm hooked, sold, pleased, entertained, smiling and confident that when I place my next order everything will be handled in a quick and professional way.

Thank you Amazon

7756100,5,B01G5XD8GS,We have spent every weekend watching a couple more episodes- we absolutely love it!  Seller was great; condition was new; arrived in record time.  Just wish we had more time to actually watch them.  But at least we have something to keep us busy when we are home and relaxing!  Well worth the investment!,1372550400,,304,4.574074074074074
7756101,5,B01G5XD8GS,"The 1-star review---about the price of the complete series only---may be right so before you buy the complete series, check out the prices of each season individually.  I bought the seasons one at a time.  That said, I want to post one review and not five so I came here.  I watched all five seasons and enjoyed everyone of them.  Too bad this story had to end, but at least they ended with a real conclusion.

But I have a strange thought that the last scene in season five may be a hint that there is more to come. I hope so.

In the BBC's Merlin, we discover a Merlin that starts somewhat innocent and naive and he makes mistakes learning how to use his power and hide it as the same time, but it is those mistakes he makes and Prince/King Arthur makes that I think makes this series worth watching.

And I really learned to loathe the character of Morgana. The actress in that roll did a great job creating an evil, twisted character.",1369353600,27,938,4.295454545454546

7756105,5,B01G5XD8GS,"I really just love this show. The actors are fun and perfectly cast for their roles, the writing is witty and clever, and the story is told in an exciting and fresh way while still staying fairly true to the Arthurian roots. Katy McGrath's evolution as Morgana is amazing throughout the series, building a sense of empathy and understanding in the viewer for a traditionally maligned character.",1412208000,,394,4.895522388059701
7756106,5,B01G5XD8GS,"This is a captivating series and I love it. It is great reminder for me of some school years and the memories it evoked.  The only problem with these discs is disc number four.  Disc four of my set displays a lot of colored squares at the beginning before the actual start of the content.  It was obviously copied improperly.  Disc four of the of the first (BOOK) is the offender. Most of the content after this bad start is okay.  Again,  I am very satisfied with this series and I'll treasure it for many years.

I truely loved how they did the tv series. It had an excellent story line. Actors and actress did did very well in this. I was glad to see a tv based series that was not based on sexural needs and desires. It's a good series for all ages.

7756122,4,B01G5XD8GS,"By the end of the first season, I had high hopes for this revision of the Arthurian Legend.  Like Star Trek, Merlin's tale had been moved to a different reality, bringing all the characters into one ""Now,"" with a young warlock bumbling his way through his destiny to enable a young prince to fulfill his own destiny.  The five seasons seem to have covered a ""real time"" of about five years.  Morgana appears in Arthur's life many years before she did in the Legend.  Lancelot and Mordred, likewise, appear long before their chronology in the Legend.  Camelot is a grand castle totally anachronistic for 5th Century Britain.  Nobody in Europe could have built such a place at a time when Rome was receding from its empire.  No matter.  The clothes, the knights' armor, the horses, stirrups, etc., all way out of synch with the times.  But, no matter.  Merlin is charmingly naive but clever, Arthur is everyone's idea of a beautiful prince without a clue.  And this new imagining of the Arthurian Legend is run into the ground, with a dark ending, unsatisfying indeed.  He even gets a Viking funeral, the burning boat, when everyone knows he lies asleep in a cave, The Once And Future King.....",1403740800,2,1192,4.705314009661835

7756132,5,B01G5XD8GS,"This series is definitely worth the ownership of these DVDs; the only thing better than this purchase would be to have them all in one complete set box, rather than separated into seasons. That does not, however, detract from the quality of the series.  If you like fantasy, comedy, drama, and complete emotional involvement, all rolled into one, this series is for you!  Don't buy just one!  You'll want for more!",1397001600,3,414,4.802816901408451
7756133,5,B01G5XD8GS,"For decades Star Trek originals, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager have been my favorite series....until I watched Merlin on Netflix.  I will be buying it very soon, I can't wait.  The stories are wonderful and well-conceived and written.  Gorgeous scenery and music, wonderful acting, the characters grow and change, and the friendship that builds between Merlin and Arthur is funny and heart-warming.  And who wouldn't enjoy watching lovely women, and men in chain maille and capes, riding beautiful horses through really wonderful places.  Then there are the interesting magical creatures, and especially The Great Dragon, voice of the great John Hurt, who is fun, fascinating and sometimes even kind of a drama queen (king in his case).

The best part has got to be Colin Morgan.  He won the British actors award in a series for season 5 even beating out Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock on Masterpiece Mysteries, and that's saying a lot because he's great.  They were thinking of doing a movie since the series was such a big hit, but Colin said ""no"" because good acting depends on diversity.  As much as I would have loved more Merlin, I think his decision says a lot about his acting abilities and future.  I could easily see him having as big a career as Daniel Day-Lewis is he choses.

This is a family oriented series.  There is jousting, and lots of sword play, but NO gore.

Anyway, don't miss this series no matter the cost.  You will watch it more than once if you love this kind of story.",1396569600,2,1498,4.7335907335907335

7756136,5,B01G5XD8GS,"I bought it as it seemed like a classic from the first episode. Each episode seems self contained so you might begin anywhere and it wouldn't  make too much of a difference. The chemistry between Arthur and Merlin is magical and fun and the episodes become more epic in presentation after the second year. I loan it out to young families who are in my practice and it became a tradition for the family to get together every Sunday night as a family and watch one or two episodes.
Yes there is fighting but you don't see much of it just the sounds and really no blood.  I find it difficult not to ""gush"" with the joy I experienced watching this series.  I am so happy having it in my collection.",1394668800,,694,4.282442748091603

The series seemed to end when it shouldn't We would love to see it where about 19 years has passed and the rest of the story could be told.

7756158,5,B01G5XD8GS,"We came to the round table party a bit late, but my hubby, daughters and I got quickly hooked. We plowed through all five seasons swiftly, multiple episodes night after night. We thoroughly enjoyed this series and have begun recommending it to our sons, friends and other family who haven't seen it yet. No, it's not absolutely perfect in every detail, but those little imperfections aren't even worth recalling, not for us anyway. As a quick side note, there's a good deal of lovely music throughout this as well.

All in all this series was a fun ride, though quite sad at times too. This really does have heart and soul. There is genuinely some great acting/actors, an absolutely gorgeous (French) castle and (Welsh) country-side, wonderful horses and many interesting life `morals/lessons'. You could say that there are metaphors for a number of key things. Beyond many details, I quite enjoyed the old fellow who mentors Merlin. The character, the actor, was heart-warming and interesting as he fathers the boy and then advises the young man. The father/king of Arthur is a sympathetic complex character. I can't help but like Uther despite his `bad king' moments (like when innocents die). Uther definitely makes some major mistakes. Which characters don't make mistakes? Merlin, Arthur and other key characters also make mistakes and learn from some. Many of the characters grow in various ways through the series. Some of the evil characters are entirely `hate-worthy'. And sometimes, you just want to give the `good' characters a consoling hug.

If you like Arthurian myths/legends, you will probably like this series, though some people might find it somewhat of a re-imagination in places. Legend purists might be peeved now and then, but we are fine to suspend our disbelief when necessary, especially since we are talking myths and legends here. If you really don't like fantasy or magic, you probably won't like this series. There is plenty of magic, a unicorn, and dragons. One of my daughters is quite a myths, languages and history buff of many years (maybe perhaps British Isles history etcetera most of all) and she enjoyed many details, particularly the old English that was spoken for the supposed magical spells and the other language influence (the dragon speak).

My grandsons are coming to visit again soon, and I can't wait to share this series with them. I know they will enjoy the fabulous jousting and lively swordplay, and beyond that, the relationship interactions between the two main characters. This is a `buddy movie' series, it definitely has a deal of romance, there are many tender-hearted moments as well as jolly gags, and there's plenty of frights to make your pulse quicken, and nasty baddies to hate. You see, this is why it is fun for the entire family - something for everyone. Well, maybe not for little kids. Many fight scenes were very well done, and I couldn't get enough of the horses, but then, I'm a horse nut. There are serious moments, scary stuff and fun `comic relief' bits here and there. This is overall a family friendly `night in' at the movies. Get the popcorn ready: a perfect fit to this highly enjoyable series.

Update: Our grandsons have been here for an extended visit and have been zipping through this series with us, a couple or few episodes each night. They are very invested in certain characters, loving some, hating others, as the story continues and characters change or come and go. It has been entertaining to see my grandsons' reactions to events and to see how passionate they've been getting at many points in the story. Beyond their laughing at the earlier lighter episodes that are laced with humor, they become quite serious as the series goes on and gets a bit darker. Still, throughout, we've been discussing good/bad kings/queens, political systems, freedom versus tyranny, equality, fairness, justice and other subjects that have been coming up because of the show. I thought my grandsons would like the shows, but they have been more intrigued than I had imagined that they would be. I don't know that this would be age appropriate for younger than maybe eight years old, but it's not too complex for my grandsons that age and older.",1379980800,12,4221,4.915848527349229

8762349,5,B01G5XD8GS,"I loved this series. I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. Westworld and Outlander are a couple of my current favorites.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1444,5.645161290322581

8762357,5,B01G5XD8GS,"This is one of my favorite series. People complain about the liberties the writers took but...the fact of the matter is, the legend of Arthur and his knights is just that, a legend. And, sorry folks, legends grow and expand. The point is to keep the core of the original story, and as a lifelong student of the legend, I think this is successful. And yes, the ending is sad, but not so, Arthur is The Once and Future King and he will return from Avalon... Not a cave as someone suggested, it's Merlin that goes into the cave also to return. Plus it's family friendly, giving kids an opportunity to love something that would otherwise require heavy editing.",1468972800,,656,4.5210084033613445
