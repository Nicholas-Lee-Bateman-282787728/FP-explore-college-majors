2934513,5,B000VAPZM2,I've seen the First High School Musical Movie on the Disney Channel & I have it on DVD.I haven't seen High School Musical2 yet since I don't have cable at home anymore. I have to want for the DVD to come out. In High School Musical2 I hope that Troy & Gabriella will finally kiss in the movie. And I defintley like to see of the new songs & new danees they will have in High School Musical2. I can't wait for the DVD of High School Musical2 to come out soon!!!!,1188000000,4,461,4.021739130434782
2934514,4,B000VAPZM2,"This sequel to High School Musical features the same stars as the first film and nearly the same plot. Once again, high school hunk Troy (Zac Efron) ponders whether he should stick to the stuff he knows (in this case, the sweet Gabriella), the conniving Sharpay wants him there beside her, and eventually everyone learns that they're all in this together. OK, that wasn't fair. That's also the plot of ""Grease,"" and for that matter, nearly every other teen musical.

In this case, though, I couldn't help feeling let down. Unlike the original (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-Encore-Edition/dp/B000F2BNW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical (Encore Edition)</a>), this film breathes not a breath of fresh air. It is, in essence, just a clone of its mama. If you loved the first film you'd like this one -- it has the same feel-good bounce -- but I bet you won't be watching it as often.

So why four stars? The music. It's better! ""You Are The Music In Me"" is a sincere, catchy duet by Gabriella and Troy (Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron) that uses a gospel chorus to rise above nearly everything ever cranked out by today's dime-a-dozen pop tarts. ""Everyday"" (also Gabriella and Troy) is in the same vein, a Britney-esque bouncer with a finale that seems literally straight out of a black church. ""I Don't Dance"" boogies along like an old big-band number, while the staccato boy-band rocker ""Bet On It"" (Troy) recalls the best of Michael Jackson. Finally, ""All for One"" is a hand-clapping shout-out that hints, a little, at Sheryl Crow's ""Soak in the Sun."" The soundtrack is available here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-2/dp/B000QCTGIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical 2</a>.

Why ""Extended Edition'? Because an additional music scene has been integrated into the film: the musical number Troy and Sharpay rehearse. The scene features Sharpay playing a pineapple princess looking for her ""fresh fish prince"" in the Polynesian fantasy  ""Humuhumunukunukua'pua'a.""  Bonus features include a sing-along feature, rehearsal footage and music videos.

One final note: Though this DVD is in fullscreen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Blu-ray-version/dp/B000VASG3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Blu-ray version</a>&nbsp;is widescreen.",1187827200,23,2422,6.108823529411764
2934515,5,B000VAPZM2,I absolutely love this movie as much as I love the first one! I am 21 years old and just hooked on the characters and the music! I am a big fan and would recommend this to everybody!,1187827200,,182,3.8157894736842106
2934516,5,B000VAPZM2,"I watched High School Musical 1 and I watched High School Musical 2 and all I have to say is bravo! High School Musical 2 is as good as the first if not better. The music is alot better in the second movie than the first. I like the fact that the High School Musical 2 was set in the real world instead of a high school. I liked all the characters. They all were great. I am 35 and and I absolutely loved watching these movies because after all I am still a big kid at heart. This movie is for everyone of all ages. I don't care if your past 20, if your a big kid at heart then you are going to love this movie it was awesome and really fun. The comedy, drama,romance,and music was just fantastic! I waited along time for this movie to come on tv like the rest of you, all I have to say is I definately was not disapponted with this movie. I am going to buy this along with the first one when this is available on dvd. I recommend you buy this dvd you won't be disappointed. Like I said I am 35 I Loved this movie!, and if you're like a big kid no matter what age you are, and if you liked the first one then you are definately going to love this movie as well if not better than the first, because not only does it take place other than a high school not that there is anything wrong with that but the scenery was alot better This movie also had every element that a family movie should have.",1187827200,,1393,3.9257950530035335
2934517,3,B000VAPZM2,"I  watched the premiere on the Disney Channel. It was OK, but I prefer the first one. The biggest problem I had is with the music numbers. For the most part, they seemed overproduced. When I watch a musical, I don't like to hear a soloist with their own voice as a backup vocal. It felt more like a vehicle for a pop album (a big music video)than it did a musical.

The only exception would be the ""I Don't Dance"" number. I loved that one, and it felt more in the style of a musical.",1187740800,7,483,4.020833333333333
2934518,5,B000VAPZM2,"Having been a Disney fan all my life, I always look forward to new releases.  With the Success of High School Musical I wondered how they could top this production.  They did though.  HSM2 is thoroughly enjoyable with great acting by all the cast and the musical numbers are out of this world.  The energy exibited along with the fun they seemed to have during the production made it even more enjoyable.  It is a fantastic production and I recommend it for anybody who enjoys Disney.  This is sure to become a classic.",1187740800,12,519,4.526881720430108
2934519,5,B000VAPZM2,"I have read some reviews which said that some of the movie doesn't make sense (ex-Troy being a team player in the first movie but not in the second) but in all reality it does because high school doesn't always make sense. You try to fit in when and where you can. It's a part of trying to find yourself which is what I think Troy was trying to do.

As far as the movie goes it was a really good movie. The gang is out for summer and they are all looking for a summer job. Troy gets a call from a Golf club and resort and he accepts the offer and gets the rest of the gang in too. However he is unaware that Sharpay & Ryans parents own the club and Sharpay is only trying to get with Troy. Troy goes through a lot of mishaps trying to find himself and he only gets himself into a lot of trouble. As usual Sharpay is only looking out for herself and is only interested in Troy. Sharpay and Troy hang out a lot during the movie because it is all in Sharpays plan to win over Troy. Just know in the end it doesn't work. Troy hurts and makes a lot of people mad in this movie. You defintely see a different side of everyone in this movie. Expect the unexpected because I think you will be very surprised at some parts of this movie. Welcome to high school where everything gets complicated.

The songs in the movie however, are amazing. I like that there a lot of ballads and duets between Troy and Gabriella. The songs between those two are so powerful and meaningful in this movie. Again they were amazing. There are also quite a bit of songs with the entire group minus the Evans. There are quite a bit of upbeat songs and some slow songs which give a great variety once again.

The only thing I did not like about this movie is how Troy treated Gabriella. I wanted to see their relationship progress more than what it did.",1187568000,3,1822,4.126760563380282
2934520,5,B000VAPZM2,"I could not wait to see High School Musical 2 since the beginning of June! And now that it finally came and went, I was a little disappointed. I mean, the songs & sounds are unbelieveably catchy, but the story just didn't work out.

Zac/Troy was the only one in the first movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-Two-Disc-Remix-Edition/dp/B000I2J6SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical (Two-Disc Remix Edition)</a>&nbsp;who was a ""team player,"" convincing everybody that you can do whatever you want, as long as you do it together. But he was the one who fell apart and lost everything when he wasn't a team player in this one. It just didn't make sense.

The songs were good, but the story didn't match up. However, this series is still one of my favorite movies! Must watch!",1187395200,,848,5.6171875

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

2934597,2,B000VAPZM2,"While the story is - shockingly - a rewrite of the first HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, what I find noteworthy about the 2007 television movie HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, PART TWO is Zac Efron's performance. Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel upstage him in the first HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL but the talented Mr. Efron finds his mojo in this sequel. Not that he's the only appealing actor among these young performers, but as I write this in 2015 far Zac Efron's been the most visible of the bunch outside of the three H.S.M. features, appearing in well-received films such as ORSON WELLES AND ME and the HAIRSPRAY remake, as well as the popular, albeit mediocre, SEVENTEEN AGAIN.",1422230400,2,657,4.771929824561403

Their romance is very touching.  The music and dancing is fantastic.  All the actors and actresses played great roles.,1254960000,,276,4.6875
2934671,3,B000VAPZM2,"Strip away the excess padding of the film's hefty 111 minute running-time and some of the more overblown musical numbers and you just might enjoy this as much as the first ""High School Musical"", but then you've missed the whole point.  Director/choreographer Kenny Ortega really goes to town with HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2, the sequel to the surprise smash-hit Disney Channel movie, set during the gang's summer vacation.

When Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and their friends all land summer jobs at the ritzy Lava Springs resort owned by Sharpay and Ryan's parents, they simply can't believe their luck - and there's even going to be an end-of-summer talent competition!  But when Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) starts manipulating Troy for her own amusement, will he choose a college scholarship over Gabriella and his friends?

The plot is as predictable as the first movie, but these ""High School Musical"" films need to be enjoyed on another level entirely.  Kenny Ortega has furnished the movie with tonnes of electric dance routines and the cast gives their absolute all.  Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens make sweet music in the leads but the spotlight always ends up roaming to Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel as the duplicitous twins Sharpay and Ryan--they really get to shine in this film.

Supposed time lapse occurs by seeing all 3. No. 1 and No. 2 are about a B value whereas No. 3 is A in my opinion.  I enjoyed all 3 and have a very young granddaughter that will watch any of them.

2934674,1,B000VAPZM2,"WHAT! AGAIN! YOU MEAN THERE'S A SEQUEL! Well of course there is. Everyone knows that Disney's gonna milk this for all its worth as long as uncultured kids and their parents (cause they're the ones with the money) will buy into it. So what can I say that I haven't already said about the first? Well this superfluous sequel is obviously a rehash of the first only set at the end of the school year and at a country club. There's just too much similarity between the basketball song and dance of the first and the baseball song and dance of this one. And like someone else said, when were dance and baseball the same? I don't care if Gene Kelly incorporated sports moves in his choreography, in the big scheme of things, they don't mix (and for not being able to dance, the ""ethnic"" jock sure can dance [if that's what you want to call it]). And now that I've moved on to the songs; well, what can I say but UTTER RUBISH! Again they are uncatchy and really make no sense in the sequence of things other than to shoehorn in another (badly performed) song and (poorly choreographed) dance. The big brassy opener is a poor attempt to ""get back in"" to the picture. The one performed by the rich girl and her brother could've been explained in actual dialogue. And the spontaneity of when they actually do sing seems robotic. Did any of these ""actors"" have the balls (dance numbers aside) to perform live? The overacting (and the horrible choreography) on Efron's part during his, I guess you would call it a lament (when he dances idoitically around the golf course), makes it seem like he's a raving lunatic (and people said Meryl Streep overacted and looked ridiculous when she was singing The Winner Takes It All). And while I'm on the Mamma Mia! note; Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing? Are you joking? Has anybody heard these tone deaf peons? The only reason they sound good is through the magic of editing. If you watch the making of features of Mamma Mia and see some of Brosnan's recordings, he actually does sound as he does on the film/soundtrack. People may not think I'm being fair because I like Brosnan, Streep and Mamma Mia altogether but I know good acting and singing when I see it and HSM (1, 2 or3) definately, not in a million years or til the end of days, is it. At least when he sang, he did it with emotion. And I'm gonna stop there for the songs because they're the sung the same and over acted. Again, character development would be welcome but the two main leads stay the same (they break up about mid-way but get back together anyway), the white jock's sidekick remains the same and the mean girl remains, well, mean, rude and obnoxious (except at the end to sing the big finale number but only to return to her nasty ways in the third film). And the acting! This just has Oscar worthy written all over it! Every time Efron looks he's mad or is supposed to emote any feeling for that matter, he looks like he's about to break down and cry (even after ""yelling"" at his best friend). And let's not forget the un-memorable cameo by Miley ""gonna ruin three time Grammy award-winning group Radiohead because they didn't wanna meet me"" Cyrus by the pool. It's a shame that this is the same company that gave us ""Dumbo"" (Walt's favorite, might I add), ""Sleeping Beauty"" and so many other countless classics. Disney would be ashamed of what his dream has become! I know he definately would've kicked the one girl out after those pictures ""leaked"" onto the Internet (same thing goes for Cyrus). He wouldn't have them ruining the image that he worked so hard to achieve (I know there was that business with Annette Funicello being in a bikini but she had moved on from the corporation by then).",1236902400,5,3700,4.49925705794948

2934687,3,B000VAPZM2,"Before I review this movie, I would like to give a little background as to my history with High School Musical.  I had no interest, whatsoever, to see High School Musical.  The Disney channel and its movies used to be filled with magic and beauty.  Over the years, Disney has really lost its flair for the magic that once was.  My youger brother told me about High School Musical and I told him to piss off!  But then just before I had to go off to work, he pops in the dvd and makes me watch the first 15 minutes.  I was hooked!  Seeing these two kids singing for the first time, falling in love right before my eyes left me smiling all day.  I wanted to see what would happen next.  I eventually saw the entire movie and loved every minute of it.  Its message of acceptance in High School and the pressures of fitting in I thought were very relevant.  The remembrance of first loves, school spirit, friends were all a part of the High School Musical experience.  Yes, the cheesiness of the dialouge gave little chance for most of the actors to turn in mind blowing performances.  But given the material, the cast succeeded with flying colors.  The magic of Disney was back.  And the world was also aware of this because, what would follow would be one of the most inticipated sequels in Disney history, High School Musical 2.  I am not ashamed to say that I rushed to the television to watch the sequel, in all its majesty.  I am not suprised to say that the sequel was made on a grander scale but lost alot of that magic that made the first so special. Yes, it had more songs, more dancing, and more cheesiness.  The truth of the matter is that the creators of High School Musical 2 made the same mistake that most sequels make.  They thought that more is better when that is obviously not the case.  The magic of Troy and Gabriella was replaced with, ""When are they gonna kiss?""  But that is not to say that High School Musical 2 doesnt have its moments. There is the idea that there is alot of pressure on teens about what to do after high school, finding the money for college.

  While there are fewer songs in this movie that are good, the ones that are, rival the quality of the first High School Musical film.  Two of my personal favorites were ""Gotta Go My Own Way"" and ""Bet On It"".  Its not a great movie and its nowhere near as good as the first, but i did enjoy it for what it effort and I would reccomend it to HSM fans.  But then again, HSM fans don't need me to convince them!  Looking forward to the theatrical release of High School Musical 3!  yay!  See you in the theater!",1222732800,,2593,4.2648870636550305
2934688,5,B000VAPZM2,"I was amazed by the amount of extras on this 2-Disc DVD set. What a fantastic set--with over 5 hours of bonus material. The story is typically light-hearted fun as you would expect from this franchise. It's the last day of school, and all your favorite East High Wildcats are counting down the seconds for the final bell that tells them it's finally summer! The rousing opening song is ""What Time Is It?"" and gets the movie off to a high energy start. Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens), and the gang must get summer jobs; meanwhile, Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) wants to get Troy a job at her country club, Lava Springs, so that he can sing with her at the talent show and become her new boyfriend. Unbeknownst to her, the club's manager, Mr. Fulton (Mark L. Taylor), has to hire the entire gang to get Troy...including Troy's girlfriend Gabriella. Sharpay does everything she can to break the two up, including setting Zac up with a sweet college scholarship. Can Zac resist?

Visually, this movie is a technicolor feast that harks back to the Esther Williams/Busby Berkeley musicals of MGM. One of the most spectacular numbers if ""Fabulous,"" sung by Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) as she lets everyone at the pool know that she has impossibly high standards. Her brother, played by Lucas Grabeel, is dolled up like Elton John and plays a pink piano in the shallow end of the pool while wearing a white tux with hot pink lapels. Definitely classic!

Spec-wise, the DVD audio is a speaker blowing Dolby Digital 5.1 mix and the video is full-frame. Sure, for those with 16x9 or widescreen TVs it's a disappointment. However, this movie was originally shown on the Disney Channel, and as you can clearly see in the behind-the-scenes documentaries (as you look over the shoulder of the camera and see the framing), this movie was COMPOSED for full-screen, even though there was spillover frame to fill out a widescreen. Minor quibbling point...still a great piece of entertainment suitable for ALL ages.

Now onto the extras...there's a ton! You get a great sneak-peak at High School Musical 3 (which will actually debut in theaters), which shows that the whole gang is back, along with three newcomers (looks like Sharpay may have some competition in the conniving department from the new girl). There are also some deleted scenes; although they were trimmed for the right reasons, one does explain a little bit of how Gabriela got to the Country Club for the talent show. Backstage Disney also gives you High School Confidential, an assortment of LOTS of featurettes such as:
*Manly the Dog: director Kenny Ortega's dog who has a featured spot in the movie as Sharpay's pampered pet.
*Sharpettes: Sharpay's sidekicks, featured in the ""Fabulous"" number
*Hilarious one about Ashley Tisdale; all her costars say she is like Sharpay, even though she protests. Very cute.
*Zac Factor: All about Zac Efron
*Special photo gallery where you can guess what baby photos match your fave HSM star.
*The Making Of ""HUMUHUMUNUKUNUKUAPUA'A.""
*Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus is actually in HSM2; never knew that until I saw the featurette about her cameo!
*Cast Favorites: The stars dish (except for Zac who is not in this one) about their favorite singers, movie actors, desserts, and more.
*On Location - Visit the resort area of St. George, Utah
*In The Kitchen - Lucas Grabeel takes fans behind the scenes of the clubhouse kitchen set.

In the Music & More section you get:
*Dance Along: follow along to the moves of ""What Time is it?"" and ""All For One."" You'll be doing these dances in no time by following multiple camera angles.
*Music Video ""All For One"" - A special performance of the song is intercut with the cast recording session and behind-the-scenes footage.

And lots more! All HSM fans should add this one to their collections!",1221091200,20,3825,4.869431643625192

Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), the club owners' daughter, has her eye on Troy, too, and is wooing him with a possible college scholarship.

This is one fun musical.  All the high school stereotypes are here - the jocks, the brainiacs, the snobs, singing and dancing their way into our hearts.  There's a big musical number about every five minutes and the productions are energetic and fun.  Clearly aimed at the pre-teen audience, this movie is full of young, good-looking actors who make being seventeen look like the Most.  Fun.  Ever.  Efron and Hudgens are an adorable and wholesome couple while Tisdale is the teen witch you love to hate.

Kudos to Disney for remembering that kids need good, wholesome entertainment in this day and time and the music is great, too!

If you are looking to buy a teen/kid  friendly movie this is the one to buy.  It fun to watch and great for the whole family.",1209427200,,509,4.538461538461538
2934698,1,B000VAPZM2,"Parents: on the surface, HSM 2 impersonates a virtuous, family-friendly vehicle which spares your children from unhealthy influences and suggestions (promiscuous/premarital/swinging sex, drugs, gangs, alcohol, violence), but after fair and balanced analysis, it ONLY LOOKS that way. Beneath its surface of bubble-gum ""innocence"" and triviality lies a hotbed of SIN (both mortal, venial) that the malevolent liberals who monopolize the entertainment world are hiding from you in plain sight, but still selling to your kids. No fear, however!!!! I've done all the grueling, analytical work, in place of lazy and careless parents who don't give a damn, to outline precisely all the SINS in HSM 2 so you parents can shield your kids from this hostile influence.

Under the fiendish guise of  promoting to teens activities that are healthy and the opposite of the destructive influences usually peddled on teens from our liberal media and pop culture, HSM 2 endorses dancing!!!! It's not just dancing...it's the even more effeminate mischief of Broadway-style musical numbers and the uncontrollable urge to break out in show tunes at horridly timed places all over the movie. Because of this severely emasculating element, HSM 2 runs the risk of potentially turning some formerly male, teen viewers into you-know-whats.

Mark my words: HSM 2 and movies like it are really a clandestine, feminist plan to emasculate what little ""maleness"" our modern society still has left!!!! For goodness sake, if you don't know, Zac Efron (Troy) even unabashedly wears makeup in real life--just look at his bizarre, coifed appearance at premieres. Intellectually honest people will readily admit that America in the 21st century is already on its way to being turned into a limp-wristed society due to all the women who ""whip"" their men. Well, HSM 2 takes that feminist ideology and targets it to impressionable, male teens. Where male teens ought to have their masculinity encouraged by developing their leadership, athleticism and self-reliance, HSM 2 schemes to take this away from them, especially with all the Zac Efron singing and dancing.

A misdirected fantasy among some parents is HSM 2 encourages kids to develop their talents and ""be themselves"" (even if that ""self"" is rather effeminate!). However, look more analytically and you'll find HSM 2 actually promotes nothing but materialism and superficial attractiveness which are bane for a society, because one should ideally judge people by their character, not how they look or how great their clothes are.

As such, HSM 2 is a catastrophic, ethical abuser in that its young ""stars"" are marketed in the roles of their characters as perfectly groomed; into the latest, trendy fashions; and more attractive than you'll find in run-of-the-mill high schools all over the US (trust me, I check out teens in high schools always). The Corbin Blue and Efron characters dress like little, perfect models straight out of the Abercrombie and Finch catalogues (oops, my bad: Corbin Blue would be excluded since he's not white!)!!!! The worst offending characters as it concerns proselytizing kids with messages about materialism are Sharpay and Ryan. They snidely prance around in their Juicy Couture and Ralph Loren Polo, respectively, which makes kids of lesser socio-economic backgrounds feel worthless. Hasn't Disney yet learned that they should shield teens from the harsh reality of unequal income backgrounds and instead feed them unrealistic propaganda to make sure their feelings are spared??!!

Perhaps, just perhaps...the most affronting contravention is the shocking amount of F-L-E-S-H that HSM 2's nubile and supple, teen actors expose and brandish as they skimpily bound around the screen in mock perkiness, which sees their corresponding body parts bouncing along. For an allegedly wholesome movie, HSM 2 showcases many young, coming-of-age girls who wear bathing suits and sleeveless/strapless outfits!!!! Parents, it gets much worse as some of these same, nubile girls who are hopefully still virgins in real life show cleavage--and this movie's targeted to tweens!!!! WTF?!?!

Yet another area of discomfort relates to Troy and Gabriella's rebelliousness throughout the film! Is Disney plotting to glorify teen disobedience of rules and authority, or what? I'm talking about Troy and Gabriella breaking country club rules by going skinny dipping in the pool at night, though they well know staff members are prohibited from such mischief! I'm also talking about the same, two characters picnicking on the golf course when they know trouble awaits them if discovered!!!!

In closing, I just must express my distaste at the real-life, personal turmoil that one of the most horrid examples to young kids and people in general exhibits. I'm, clearly, pointing my righteous finger at Vanessa Hudgens who earlier this year was divulged as a sexual miscreant for salaciously posing nude in pictures which got leaked onto the internet!!!! Parents, this is the vulgar fetishist whom you are allowing to ""entertain"" your kids!!!! For my part, I'm boycotting Disney until they fire Hudgens for being a fallen ""role model"" to kids everywhere; in fact, I'm not letting ANY KIDS (even other people's) see HSM 2 out of protest.",1208649600,6,5262,5.331325301204819

2934717,1,B000VAPZM2,"For the most part, I would say HSM2 was better than HSM1 (although HSM1 didn't exactly pose good competition).  I thought the characters were (to some extent) more realistic.  They worried about things teens would actually worry about, such as paying for college.  In the first one all they cared about was, and I quote ""People doing things that aren't their thing"".  I also felt like I got a complete story in this one.  You at least got to see the talent show in HSM2 while they barely gave you any information much less let you see the all-important musical in HSM1, which left me with a feeling of  ""that's it?"".  I'm afraid those are the only good things I can say however.

 The plot could've been better, a lot better.  A bunch of teenagers, including the movie's lead couple, Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez, get summer jobs at a country club.  The country club holds an annual talent show, and awards the Star Dazzle trophy to the best act.  The teenagers decide to participate.  The antagonist, Sharpay Evans (who also happens to be the country club's owner's daughter) has won the Star Dazzle trophy every year for a long time and is afraid the teenagers mentioned above will win it instead.  In an effort to stop them, she tries to break up Troy and Gabriella, who she holds a grudge against because they won the lead roles in the high school musical that the first movie was named for.  She succeeds temporarily, but of course they get back together and everyone is happy in the end.  It's Disney, what do you expect?  Sharpay decides to be nice for no reason at all, not seeming to mind that Troy ditched singing with her to sing with Gabriella instead.  They all sing ""All for One"", by the pool, a song about how they're all going to be friends after this.  Funny, the last movie had a similar ending but Sharpay was mean again in this one.  The same thing will probably happen in HSM3.  Yes, they're going to curse us with another one, and it's even going to come out in theaters so they can make more money.  The only thing that wasn't predictable about HSM2 was how the Star Dazzle trophy went to Sharpay's brother, Ryan, instead of Troy and Gabriella as everyone expected.  There were a few parts that were actually supposed to made me laugh that succeeded, such as when Troy was giving golf lessons, but for the most part the humor had too much of the ""Oh puh-leeze"" factor.  The romance was as pathetic as ever.  I found it stupid how there were so many times when Troy and Gabriella came inches away from kissing but were always interrupted.  This got really old really quickly, and after the first time you could see it coming from miles away.  You could also see it coming when they finally do kiss at the end, when everybody is playing in the sprinklers.  I don't see why that scene was necessary.  The kiss I understand, but what is so entertaining about a bunch of teenagers playing in some sprinklers?  The music, I don't even want to go there...but I will.

  The songs were just as bad as those in the first one.  If you expect to enjoy any of the musical numbers, you'll have to throw all logic out the window.  If not, you'll be asking questions like ""What's a Pepto-Bismol pink piano doing in the middle of the pool?""  ""Since when are baseball and dancing the `same game'"" ""How come their boss doesn't hear them bursting out in song in the kitchen"" ""How'd Gabriella get back into the country club if she quit and why would she even if she could?""  ""How can Troy and Gabriella still know the words to a song that they've supposedly never heard before when they're no longer reading over Kelsi's shoulder and how can we hear instruments besides a piano when it's obvious that the piano is the only instrument in the room?"" ""Wouldn't they get in trouble for bouncing basketballs in the hallway?"" ""Why is her so-called iced tea blue?"" and ""What is Zac Efron doing dancing around on the golf course like an idiot?"" I will admit this is somewhat true with any musical, but not nearly as much as with ""High School Musical 2"".  Songs like ""Gotta Go My Own Way"" are supposed to make you cry, but instead are just flat out corny.  You know they're going to get back together in the end, so why get upset now?  The only good thing about the songs is that the filmmakers were at least smart enough to delete ""Humahumanukanukapua'a"" or whatever it is. That has to be the dumbest song I've ever heard.

  The acting was pretty bad too.  Ashley Tisdale tries waaaaaaayyyy too hard as Sharpay that the character is no longer believable.  Perhaps it's the writers' fault because none of the characters are that great.  The problem is just that...they're characters.  Good writers/actors can turn their characters into living, breathing people that you actually care about.  The characters of HSM are obviously fake, because I don't think anyone is as superficial as Sharpay and I don't think anyone is as gay as Ryan or as sugary sweet as Gabriella or as look-at-me-I'm-so-cool as Troy.  The Troy character is not supposed to be this way, he's supposed to be a popular jock who's not that full of himself and is still approachable. Efron turns it into the same popular jock character we see in every other movie.  The only difference is that this jock actually has a lead role in the movie, as opposed to just being the guy all the girls throw themselves at, having no significant role besides this.  Perhaps people like the HSM characters really do exist but I still think they make bad characters.  Disney also seems to put these same, clichd characters in every tv show and movie they make.  Are writers too lazy to come up with unique, original characters anymore?  Whether it's the writers' or the actors' fault, you get the point: none of the characters became real to me.

  It didn't seem like any of the actors/actresses were good singers either.  Ashley Tisdale has to have the worst voice ever to get a record deal, and it sounds even worst when they computerize it to sound like a robot, such as in ""Fabulous"".  While better than Tisdale, Vanessa Hudgens still left much to be desired in her vocal performance.  Corbin Bleu was probably the worst of the male singers, and didn't show much range, probably because he doesn't have much of a range.  I can give props to Zac Efron because unlike the first movie, he didn't lip-sync to someone else's voice.  He actually wasn't that bad and is probably a better singer than he is an actor.  The part that made me mad was how those that actually could sing, (Lucas Grabeel and Monique Coleman) got the fewest solos.  This is probably because they don't have record deals with Disney like Vanessa and Corbin do or Ashley, who has one with Warner Bros.  Disney probably self promotes themselves more than any other movie company, so naturally they favor the recording ""artists"" who make them money despite the fact that there are more talented singers in the cast.

 I can see how this would be a cute movie for young children, but when I meet teenagers who are crazy about it, I wonder what our society is coming too.  Both ""High School Musical"" movies are completely over-rated, and do not deserve to be as successful and popular as they are.  Disney Channel makes lots of ""original"" movies that adults have never heard even heard of but are still entertaining for kids.  ""High School Musical"" and ""High School Musical 2"" should be like all of those, and not considered the best things that ever happened to the movie industry.",1202256000,5,7500,4.562125748502994

This one features the kids from East High taking a break from school, getting summer jobs, and preparing for their future.  The music is original and inspired just like last time, and Kenny Ortega never fails to impress the audience with his 1st class dance choreography.  We see new sides of the characters in the story as well as a lot of the old sides that we learned from the original.  Zac Effron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and Lucas Grabeel never cease to amaze with their singing and dancing.  The movie is filled with great musical numbers, romance, comedy and much much more!  At the risk of going too far, I would dare to say that this is one of the rare sequels that outshine the predecessor.",1201737600,,782,4.51063829787234

2934721,4,B000VAPZM2,"The second of the high school musical shows is a good view.  High School Musical 2 puts a fresh spin on the old after school special clich plot line of be true to yourself and your friends, not to mention putting it to music.  When it comes down to it Disney did just that.  Some parts of the premise are a bit out there, such as the number of people hired without interview to a country club.  The music and performances are the primary redeeming elements of the show.  The addition of ""Huma huma"" to the extended edition gives the audience better understanding of the characters attitudes following the scene, in fact the plot did not make sence without it.  Most of the characters did grow and better themselves through the story.  To sum up the movie has good points: the moral, growth, music, and performances. There were some not so good points: premise, old hat story, and a plot that requires a high school mentality.  I do have one more warning.  H.S.M.2 does not follow the classic musical format very well.  Classic musicals use music to tell the story.  H.S.M.2 only uses about half of the singing scenes to tell the story the other half are random performances.  Albeit good performances they do nothing to further the story themselves.

2934762,5,B000VAPZM2,"I've always been a fan of musicals, but the first HSM movie was one I was determined to avoid. It looked overzealous and juvenile. But then they made a sequel: HSM2. It still looked silly, but I figured it couldn't hurt to have it on in the background as I studied. Forget that idea: I was hooked within a minute of the first musical number right at the beginning. I rewound the DVR and called my roomate in frantically. We spent the rest of the night in rapt attention of one of the most catchy, well-choreographed musicals I've ever seen. Now the plot isn't exactly epic, but the acting, dancing, and singing is just superb.

In the sequel, Ryan, Troy, and Gabriella's characters are expanded greatly. We don't see much more of Sharpay, Chad, Taylor, Kelsi, Martha or Jason than we saw in the first movie, other than various music numbers and brief appearances. Gabriella breaks out of her shy persona and boldly addresses some deep issues in her relationships with Troy and Sharpay - she also befriends Ryan, who in turn is developed as his own person away from Sharpay's image. He briefly assumes Troy's role in various aspects, and befriends the Wildcats. Meanwhile, Troy tosses various ideas around in his head about what his goals and ambitions are, and what he finds important in life. He adopts a few different personality changes throughout the movie, which leads to his alienating his friends. But in the end, with some help, Troy gets back on track with his life with a new outlook on himself, his friends, and his future.

The DVD extras are enertaining, though they could have used more backstage footage (which they're likely saving for a rerelease). You can find HSM2 in a Wal-Mart special 2-pack that comes with bonus features unavailable in other stores. This Wal-Mart exlusive bonus disc includes: The Making of a Music Scene ('Gotta Go My Own Way'); Crazy Cast Questions (excl.

The story line in HSM2 is very lacking and is pretty much a remake of the late years of ""Saved by the Bell.""  The songs are not catchy and are not memorable. The story line writers and song writers must be different than HSM1. And as others mention, it is all about the relationship between Troy and Gabriella. And Sharpay is too over the top mean spirited.

2934766,4,B000VAPZM2,"What a great angle for the DVD release: film a song sequence that edits cleanly out of the broadcast premiere, then put it back to create an ""extended edition."" It certainly did not hurt the success of the Disney Channel premiere of High School Musical 2 did not include the song ""Humuhumunukunukua'pua'a,"" and it made the DVD premiere all the more exciting for the millions of fans who have made this one of the biggest  pop culture  icons of our era.

The song, by the way, is surely an affectionate nod in a way to Annette Funicello, whose top 10 hit, ""Pineapple Princess"" is referenced in the lyrics. The whole infectious silliness is very much in the fun style of the early Disney pop tunes.

And the movie is very much in the spirit of the bubbly 60's Beach Party movies that starred Annette and Frankie Avalon, though High School Musical has more budget and less innuendo. One could even draw a direct parallel between the poolside finale and Annette's poolside number in the film, Pajama Party.

To its credit, the High School Musical sequel is true to its original style and does not give into what was surely a temptation to cash in on the success with endless cross promotion (""Hey everybody! Look who's just dropped in! It's TV's Regis Philbin!"") There are very subtle cameos by Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers strictly for eagle-eyed fans and that's about it.

The bloopers are especially ingratiating, showing the cast off to its most endearing advantage. It looks like everyone's having a ball making the movie, though it's also very hard work as other special features prove (i.e. Zac Efron taken through take after take on his ""Bet on It"" number.

No tween home will likely be without one of these DVDs. Say what you want about this franchise, it's perhaps the clearest parallel from the Mickey Mouse Club days to today, utilizing a talented stock company of young talent and giving them fun, frothy entertainment to shine in.",1198108800,2,1946,4.722713864306785

2934769,4,B000VAPZM2,"Its summer vacation and the Wildcats (otherwise known as East High students) are counting down the seconds until they are free.  Of course, most of them are hoping to find summer jobs and so far having no luck.

All that changes when Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) gets offered a job at Lava Springs, the local country club.  He quickly gets jobs for all his friends, including his girlfriend Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens).

There's one thing they hadn't counted on, however.  Lava Springs is owned by the parents of Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) and Ryan (Lucas Grabeel).  Sharpay had arranged for Troy to get a job so she could steel him away from Gabriella.  So, naturally, she is furious to see the whole gang show up.

Even more important to her is the talent show.  After losing out in the winter musical at school, she wants to retain her crown in the talent show.  And the presence of her rivals just might upset that.

So Sharpay sets out to destroy her classmates by separating Troy from everyone else.  And as more great things happen to him, he begins to grow distant.  Will he remember what is truly important?  Who will win the talent show?  And will Troy ever kiss Gabriella?

I'll admit, as much as I loved the first, I didn't like this one right away.  But I watched it a second time and enjoyed it more.

This movie falls into the same trap many sequels do, the retread.  Many of the plot points feel like they were lifted from the first movie.  Now I know that movie wasn't original, but I would have preferred to see the characters make different mistakes this go around.  Additionally, the climax felt rushed, like something was cut to make everything make sense.  I liked it, but it just wasn't logical enough for me.

I loved so many of the background characters.  While they are all back, they get pushed even more into the background.  Frankly, I would have liked to see more of them.

The soundtrack this time gets a heavy pop push, with most of the songs sounding like polished pop tracks.  That makes it even more obvious that the actors are lip synching by the time they filmed the musical numbers.  In fact, some of the songs come across more as music videos then songs in a musical.  I'm sure the tween intended audience won't mind, but it did bug me.

Okay, if the movie has all these flaws, why am I giving it 4 stars?  Because, once again, the movie is fun.

While the songs are overproduced for a musical, they are still good songs.  They're fun to sing along with, and the dance numbers are great.  I especially enjoyed ""I Don't Dance.""

Set during the summer before the character's senior year, some of the characters are struggling with their future.  In fact, it's this struggle that almost separates Troy from his friends.  I felt this was a believable issue for the students to be facing, and it helped ground the story.

This movies doesn't capture the fun of the original, but it comes very close.  Watch it expecting a sequel, and you'll enjoy it just fine.",1197331200,3,2999,4.524253731343284

This sequel to the outrageously popular first movie isn't necessarily a bad sequel, but I don't think it's anything spectacular. It's got its strengths, and its weaknesses.

That little snob Sharpay is one of the major reasons I don't like this movie too great. I don't mind the actress Ashley Tisdale as a regular human being (in fact, I'm positive she's a very nice girl), but I do NOT like her character. It's like all her character cares about is her pretty little self. The whole world revolves around her, it's all about her, it doesn't matter if everyone else gets hurt or humiliated just so long as she gets what she wants, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. (Geez-Louise, Sharpay; get a life.)

There were some parts of the movie that I did like (such as the pool scene between Troy and Gabriella, and the scene where Troy makes up with his friends, and the scenes where Sharpay gets stood up), but overall, I'd give this movie a C, maybe a B-minus.",1196467200,4,1187,4.386363636363637

In this 2nd installment of the High School Musical franchise, Troy & Gabriella return in colors that pop off the screen (reminiscent of Technicolor), songs that stick in your head, and plot complications where nobody actually gets hurt. The chemistry between the leads is definitely there; you really believe that Troy & Gabriella are made to be together. The story is pretty predictable; the gang gets jobs together at a country club where self-centered Sharpay (played to excellence by Ashley Tisdale) reigns supreme as a member. You can guess it...this time around, she sets her sights on Zac and attempts to bring him into her world (think Caddyshack snobs) and break up his relationship with Gabriella so that she (Sharpay) can sing with Troy at the Country Club's annual talent show. The choreography is fantastic; the way that sports are integrated into the dancing (this time it's baseball) is something that Gene Kelly would have been proud of. From the opening number (What Time is It?""), it is hard not to get caught up in the innocent fun of this movie. Many tributes abound to MGM musicals...even Esther Williams gets a nod in some of the pool numbers. The movie is slightly over the top at times, but never to the point where it's not enjoyable and fun. The DVD has a few extras: some fun bloopers, sneak previews, music videos, and karaoke. The best part for those who love dance are the rehearsal to final number views, which allow you to see how the number grows and becomes the rip-roaring sequence that we see in the final film. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it's disappointing that the film isn't in widescreen for the DVD release, but a small point; neither were Mickey & Judy's films!

Chucky Kaplow is a very talented choreographer and he is young so we can tell he has obviously achieved alot to be working with such a prestigious director such as Kenny Ortega his work on Dirty Dancing,The writters of these two films is also very talented,the storlines are simple yet fun although im 19 i love and enjoy watching both films,i have lots of merchandise on both films.

once i watched both of them i was instantly hooked not just because of Zac or Corbin although they are a nice bonus every one on the film is great.i wish them all the best for there future careers.

However I know its Disney and who it was targeted for so I didn't really expect anything else.  I just didn't like it.

The sequel though, was much better of a movie, and the songs were much better.  I wouldn't run out an tell everyone it was a must see, but I was a fun time.

I don't understand a earlier comment/review talking about Zac's solo song and how it had backing vocals with him being the only one on screen.
If you are going to go with that train of thought then there should also be NO music accompanying ever.  That is unless you start singing at random moments in your life and there is also music too.
If that be the case you probably need a bit more help than most..",1195948800,,862,4.131736526946108

Zac and Vanessa are one of the hottest couples I've ever seen in my entire life but that still doesn't mean that they don't participate in the creation of fodder-filled products!

I hate how these celebrities make money from these brainless adults and the no-talent-loving children who support this corporately-kiddy pappy pap. I don't understand how these teens (besides Zac (20?) and Ashley, who's she's freaking 22 already!) just perform other people's crappy tunes. Ugh.

I am SO tired of them all. Corbin writes about Homework (*LOL*) and Vanessa coos her way through R&B-wannabe Pop tart music. And did you HEAR her sing that terrible song when she broke up with Zac and was on a bridge or something?? It made my ears wince in pain. She's a crappy singer, and I don't know who she had to make out with to get a record deal but she really, REALLY needs to step up her game and at least co-write 2 or 3 songs to get an ounce of my respect.

I HATE all of you (minus Zac) and wish you would go away.

I think it is a great movie for kids in high school they can see how they can deal with people that get in there way and they can see how to deal with realtionsihps. I think it shows how to deal with problems in real life in any school but, really for like kids in middle school to high school that is what type of people are in the audience. I say it is for all ages babies, kids, tweens, teens, and adults. It is about Troy Bolton (Zac Effron) and Gaabreilla (Vansesa Hudgens) get split apart by Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) again and Ryan (Luvas Crabel) becomes more independent about himself.

It is great and I say just as good as the original High School Musical.

Basically Troy (Zac Efron) and the gang are back but this time it is Summer vacation and they all get jobs at a sports club over the summer.

The songs are outstanding just like High School Musical soundtrack. Best songs are What Time Is It, You Are The Music In Me and All For One.

The DVD is released in December just in time for Christmas.

I am sure it will be on many children's and adults Christmas lists. It will certainly be in my DVD collection and I am 42 years old. It reminds me of my favourite film when I was only 12 years old, Grease.

I actually liked it better than my 17 yr old daughter.  She said it was corny and untrue to life.  However, I really liked the resort they filmed this at, and the storyline.  It is true to life on Troy's struggle for his identity, as with all teens.  I really like Lucas, who played Sharpay's brother.  He is sooooooo talented.  I really liked him in the baseball musical number. He is an excellent singer and a wonderful dancer.  I wish him a lot more success.  I would have liked to have seen the heavy-set girl do more.  She is a very talented dancer and singer.  She was always in the background.  It is also good to have non-skinny actors in these movies, because everyone is not 104lbs.  I, also, thought that the pool song number with sharpay was very clever.  It shows a lot of work was put into it.

I ,also, like these characters and these movies because the characters of Troy and Gabriella are very much like the Beach Blanket Bingo set of the 50's & 60's with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello.  As a matter of fact, Vannessa, who plays Gabriella, is just like Annette! America needs simpler and sweeter shows like these!",1189296000,4,1278,4.467532467532467

What I didn't really like was how much Troy/Gabriella (Troyella) scenes there were.  We all know that the're a couple.  That was made clear at the end of the first movie.  I thought that Sharpay was over the top at times...I liked the way she was in the first one a bit more.

All right...now for what I liked about this movie.  I loved the fact that Lucas Grabeel (Ryan) had a storyline in this one.  He did not have enough screen time in the last one; he was basically just following Sharpay around the whole time so seeing him 'break free' (pardon the pun) from Sharpay was great.  I really liked seeing Corbin Bleu (Chad) and Monique Coleman (Taylor) more in this movie.  They actually had solos in this one!  I also liked the fact that they both danced a lot more.  The rest of the supporting cast had much bigger roles as well which I really enjoyed.

This movie was also more dramatic than the first.  While some of it was definitely silly, it was also fun.  The dance numbers were the best in my opinion...especially What Time Is It, I Don't Dance and All For One.

All in all, this is a good movie for kids, tweens, teens, or anyone that likes Disney...and HSM of course. :)  I recommend it to anyone who saw the first one and loved it.  Who cares how old you are...if you ask me, you're never too old for Disney.",1189209600,14,1486,4.246428571428571

The story was good in the second one. It seemed to hold together, but I was very disappointed in the music. The songs were okay, but my problem was all the extra stuff they added to them.

In the first one if there was a solo, it was actually a solo, like when Vanessa was singing in the hallway, but in this one when Zac was singing on the golf course there was backup singers. There should not be backup singing when you are obviously standing by yourself in the middle of a golf course. Also there seeming to be a lot of computerized stuff added into all the songs which I hated. the first one was the cast using there voices to make the songs. this one you couldn't even hear them most of the time over all the other stuff.

But I gotta tell you: this film was a stinkfest. Very cliched, very cheesy, very ""obviously"" falling into scenes which then had the obligatory songs. Etc. Etc.

I also watched this on television first, unlike the first one, and was quite taken aback by the number of commercials and ""extras"" they threw in. How long was this movie? 1 hour and 10 minutes, 1 hour and 20 minutes? It seemed like there was around 40 minutes of breaks, etc. Was it just me?

I'm not sure what people expect, but it is a made for T.V. movie that had a very short production deadline.  With that in consideration, I think they did an amazing job.  I give it five stars because there is so much positive about this and the first movie.  My daughters are 5 and 7 and they are beginning to get into some of the ""tween scene"" things.  HSM and HSM2 are movies portraying teenagers that are squeaky clean and pure.  The focus is on friendship, not the horny dating scene.  I don't have to explain anything inappropriate or too adult to them.  The music is catchy and I'm not embarassed to hear them sing adult lyrics that they don't understand.  I know my perspective doesn't match everyone else's, but as a parent, I can't say enough good about these two movies.  Speaking of the two movies, I think the second looks more professionally done and the songs are even more catchy.  The dance numbers are explosive.  I'm sure this version will be under our Christmas Tree and my husband and I will tire of hearing it over and over again, but they could choose much worse!

This movie was made to appeal to pre-teen and teen viewers and it's been a hit with them this summer.  I'm not a teen, but I've always loved teen movies and I found it terrific.  I've had lots of kids say positive things to me about this movie and so I know it was well received.  I'm just so glad that musicals are popular again as I've always liked that genre.  Music has a way of touching people in ways that a regular film just can't.  Yes, this film has been marketed, but I have to say that to market successfully you have to have a good product (which this is).

Ok, we all knew that the movie producers would have a really hard time matching the success of the first movie which was a real classic.  This movie came so close to being even better than the first.  I think what did this was the outstanding music, vocal performances of Zac & Vanessa, and choreography.  Also, the ""romantic quotient"" is quite high and there are plenty of romantic scenes for those of us who like those kind of movies. Zac and Vanessa have a lot of onscreen chemistry & their real love for each other really shines through on film. I can see that there are a few scenes that are going to get 'stuck' in my dvd player! :) Also, the message is very good about staying true to yourself and making the most of opportunities while you are young.  If you go off the track, it means nothing and you can lose sight of what's really important and become someone you don't want to be.  There are more positive messages as well, and I think that's one of the things that is so great about these movies.

Extended version?  This makes me happy because it seems to mean extra features and perhaps deleted scenes.  Yipee!  It should be great.  December 11th can't come soon enough.

I got really tired of Gabriella (she's a whiner) and Sharpay (too over the top).  The only main character I enjoyed was Sharpay's brother (I forget his name).  That character was very well-written and the only one I felt that wasn't canned.  I wasn't thrilled with the acting with this one either.

True to the first movie, the dance and music sequences were spectacular.  The kids do have talent in the singing and dancing departments.  However, the soundtrack sounded like it was in a box or something.  I felt the soundtrack on the first movie was better.  This time around, there were echoes from time to time, and also some sequences sounded muffled.  This is why I dropped my rating from 4 to 3 stars.

I really don't understand the success of HSM series (they're working on a third.  Why?!?!).  I think the series is cheesy and cornball.  I guess substandard entertainment is par for the course nowadays.  It's supposed to be geared to preteens and young teens, but most of the ones I know felt both movies were lame.  Oh well.  I generally enjoy DCOM movies, but this series bombed.  I guess slick marketing is the reason why it's been so successful.

The music would have been great if it did not sound like it was coming out of a distant box...I hope the SoundTrack sounds clearer than it did on TV. Our volume had to be turned up with every song just to hear the words, Except for ""I don't dance"" which sounded great.

The sound for me really let the show down. At least it affected my enjoyment of it. Considering it being a musical, you would think that would have been one of the main priorities.

Of course...this is my opinion. Give it a watch...and see what you think.

The scene features Sharpay playing a pineapple princess looking for her ""fresh fish prince"" in the Polynesian fantasy  ""Humuhumunukunukua'pua'a."" The bonus features will be identical to the standard DVD: a sing-along feature, rehearsal footage and music videos.

As for the film itself, this sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical/dp/B000F2BNW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""High School Musical""</a>&nbsp;features the same stars and nearly the same plot. Once again, high school hunk Troy (Zac Efron) ponders whether he should stick to the stuff he knows (in this case, the sweet Gabriella), the conniving Sharpay wants him there beside her, and eventually everyone learns that they're all in this together. If you loved the first movie you'd like this one -- it has the same feel-good bounce -- but I bet you won't be watching it as often.

So why four stars? The music. It's better, and sounds fantastic in this Blu-ray release. ""You Are The Music In Me"" is a catchy duet by Gabriella and Troy (Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron) that uses a gospel chorus to rise above nearly everything cranked out by today's dime-a-dozen pop tarts. ""Everyday"" (also Gabriella and Troy) is in the same vein, an early-Britney bouncer with a finale straight out of a black church. ""I Don't Dance"" boogies along like an old big-band number with choreography inspired from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/West-Side-Story/dp/B00008972S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">West Side Story</a>, while the staccato boy-band rocker ""Bet On It"" (Troy) recalls the best of Michael Jackson. Finally, ""All for One"" is a hand-clapping, surf-guitar shout-out that hints, a little, at Sheryl Crow's ""Soak in the Sun.""",1188000000,12,2211,6.332225913621262
