3925941,5,B002GU65M4,"All of these posts have NOTHING to do with this DVD, The product on this page is the ULTIMATE 100 GREATEST FIGHTS... Not UFC 100 which all of you are ranting and raving about... UFC 100 would never sell for $90... you are all tools.... this is a recap of the top 100 fights in the UFC, Fans voted for their favorite fights of all time, they had a series on Spike that lasted about 5 episodes briefly covering all 100 bouts, this DVD *probably* has the entire length of the 100 fights on it, instead of just the Highlights like the show. Ha, even the front of this DVD has Chuck Liddell and Wanderlei Silva on it, which was one of the most exciting fights of all time at UFC 79:Nemesis... Far from UFC 100, Next time you write a review and start telling everyone how great it is, make sure your writing a review on the correct product, in this case, the correct DVD. I do not own this DVD, and Im not saying what this DVD is or is not, but it is obviously not what the other posts are referring to.

Only bad thing about a video like this is I spent money for him to watch the fights once and not watch again it's Suspense to see who wins but once you see who wins the fights that's it he prob won't watch again, not like a regular suspense movie and if you liked that you would watch over and over again!!",1426636800,,539,3.864864864864865

3925964,2,B002GU65M4,"I have watched UFC from the beginning and own many DVDs. The ""Ultimate 100"" does not include so many classic and amazing fights that should not be left out of a greatest fights collection. To me, it seemed more like UFC propoganda with specfic older fighters not being included and focused more on newer fighters.

Save you money and buy the Ultimate Knockouts, Submissions, etc DVDs. Far more entertaining and really captures how the UFC used to be; no weight clases, winner stays tournament, a really vicious fighting tournament.",1398988800,,531,4.966292134831461
3925965,5,B002GU65M4,"There isn't much I feel I need to say about this.  It's the top 100 UFC fights from UFC #1-150 I think.  The fights are played and it is six BluRays with some much fight material I just couldn't believe it.
The BluRay was like $4 more than the DVD so thats what I bought.  Great buy.",1391731200,,283,3.9298245614035086
3925966,5,B002GU65M4,Lots of great fights to watch over and over again. I also suggest you try to watch the fights against the same two people in order. Especially the Anderson Silva vs Rich Franklyn fights.,1382918400,,186,4.5
3925967,3,B002GU65M4,Seems company producing this on blu-ray didn't pay attention to what data was going on which disc.  I bought this for one fight that is on disc 5 on the blu-ray set.

3925969,5,B002GU65M4,This is a great collection of fights. Every fight on here is awesome. A must have for every UFC fan. Hopefully the UFC will do another version of this in a few years with the best fights of those years.,1379030400,,202,4.075

3925971,5,B002GU65M4,"Ok... so here we go. A review of UFC 100 greatest fights. If you like randy couture, chuck lidell, and matt hughes then this is the dvd/Blu-ray for you. It is a good collection of fights for a true fan of UFC or a person just getting into watching UFC. Personally, I love this set but I disagree with a lot of the fights on here like as in I think they left out a lot of the best fights just because the fighters are on bad terms with Dana White. The fighters I am talking about are guys like Frank Shamrock, Tito Ortiz, Tim Sylvia, Andrei Arlovski, Etc.. I understand that this dvd is based off of a poll UFC did on their website but it truly is not the 100 greatest fights in UFC history. But with all that said, there are a ton of really awesome fights in this set such as Clay Guida vs Diego Sanchez. If you are looking for a good bargain for twenty-thirty bucks then this a good one. Like I said, there are some negatives to this set but overall this set is AWESOME!!!!",1375315200,,974,4.078125
3925972,2,B002GU65M4,"There is something wrong with disc 1, half way through the disc it starts freezing and I couldn't watch three of the main fights.  Very disappointing.",1372636800,,150,4.769230769230769
3925973,5,B002GU65M4,"What you get: 100 FULL LENGTH FIGHTS from many of the best fighters out there for only $20!?!  WHAT!?!?!?  To quote Joe Rogan, ""That's crazy!""

When a PPV costs around $50 and you only see 5-8 fights and buying an event DVD costs anywhere from $15-30 and there you see 10-12 with some bonus this set comes as the UFC's best value bar none.  100 fights, some absolutely fantastic (Sanchez v. Guida) and some just so-so (Mir v. Nogueira; come on, in the moment it was momentous but in hindsight?).  Even when this aired originally on Spike TV all you got were hour synopses of 20 fights mostly broken down by Joe Rogan and you only saw a few of the standout moments of the fight.

If these were the crummy fights this wouldn't be that much of a bargain.  But it has some absolutely great fights on here (for the time that it came out many people questioned just who judged these to be the 100 greatest and that's a fair question; many of these fights wouldn't have been on my list and some of them that I hadn't seen before left me scratching my head as to who decided a particular fight or another should be on the list at all, much less placing where it did).  Want to be able to watch Liddel v. Silva with the boys at your leisure?  You got it.  Want to review a number of fights where Penn bloodies his opponent and then licks his gloves (and thus secure your wife leaving you alone for the rest of the night)?  It's here for you.  How about sampling some title bouts before you watch the latest PPV to whet your appetite?  This set has more than a few.

Any way you cut it you can't go wrong with this value-wise.  Sure people can criticize how this mostly favors bouts between UFC 40 through 90, neglecting many of the earlier UFC moments that created the bedrock for the sport.  So what?  Yeah there's large black bars on either side of your TV for the majority of time that this runs.  It's not distracting so deal.  YOU'RE ONLY PAYING $20 FOR THIS.

***Buyer beware***  Amazon sells the same thing for a significantly higher sum.  Stick to your guns and wait until you find this for the twenty dollar bill.",1370217600,,2113,4.309644670050761
3925974,4,B002GU65M4,"It is awesome to have a bunch of great fights to throw on and watch. They are the complete fights too, not just highlights. My only complaint is that I would disagree with what they call the 100 greatest fights. But that is expected. I also miss hearing the interview right after a big fight with Joe. Those are cut out.",1367366400,,320,4.262295081967213
3925975,2,B002GU65M4,"For 100 greatest fights I was expecting to be wowed, all the time, instead of being hugely disappointed because most of the fights were less interesting than the average fight on the last ultimate fighter series (which typically aren't very good).

The disc's themselves are great, you get around 25 hours of UFC action. With that said however the actual fights included are a travesty. As other have mentioned a number of fighters never made this list (Even fights considered to be some of the best in history) just because they are on bad terms with the UFC.

IT get's worse however, as the actual fights included in this set are some of the worst i have seen and in no way shape or form even belong in a top 100 greatest fights list. There are fights where all they do for 5 rounds is wrestle and not even in a way that's entertaining and I pride myself on enjoying all aspects of the sport. I'm talking pure 100% wrestling fights with no jujitsu, no passing of the guard, a total of 5-10 elbows or punches a round, almost no action what so ever. These fights seem to be included just because of who is fighting and not on the actual entertainment factor of the fights, which is what a greatest 100 fights of all time list should be about.

This would be okay if it was the occasional match, however at least 30% of the first 60 odd matches are like this and then another amount is stand up fights with nothing happening yet again. One fight in particular involves 1 minute of being pressed against the cage and then a singular grazing punch that knocks out a fighter. As a fan of the sport this disc is mostly filled with below to average fights and only a select few great ones. Which is why i give this such a low rating.

Still decent to watch but should be renamed to 100 fights of UFC's popular fighters, because there is nothing ""Great"" about the vast majority of the fights being shown here, and that is a shame.",1366502400,3,1923,4.363128491620111
3925976,5,B002GU65M4,"This is an awesome history of UFC.  It's a rundown of the best fights of all time, from the early days with almost no rules all the way to UFC 100.

If you're a MMA fan, all your favorite fighters and fights make appearances in this.  This a great history with some really entertaining moments.  You get the upsets, the grudge matches, the title shots, and the big superfights.  It's MMA at its best from 1993-2009.  Check this out for sure.",1365897600,,441,4.382716049382716

3925978,5,B002GU65M4,"This is a great dvd set if you like:

1. watching Wanderlei Silva, Mirko Cro Cop, and Keith Jardine getting knocked out a hundred times
2. 10-second knockouts being regarded as the greatest fights ever
3. every really long Randy Couture fight

This was made at the end of 2009 or something like that, I think the most recent fight on the list is Sanchez vs Guida, which rules. Since that fight there are tons of other really good fights, so you'll probably want to supplement this set with the UFC best of 2010,2011, etc. This is a hundred full fights at a good price. It's a debatable best-of list, but a good history lesson for people just getting into UFC.",1362355200,3,659,4.43801652892562

3925992,3,B002GU65M4,"Strangely, the discs inside were mislabeled.  Disc 6 had the Disc 5 label on it and vice-versa.  Also, Disc 2 wouldn't play on my PS3 (which is my only current means of watching Blu-Ray discs).  I informed Amazon of the situation and they were more than helpful so I commend them yet again on their excellent customer service.  Therefore I have actually only seen roughly 15 fights so far.
As for what I have seen, the more recent fights were in excellent quality, while some of the older ones were understandably not.  I was a bit disappointed to see the range of fighters on the disc.  It says The Ultimate 100 greatest fights, from the first 100 UFC events I assume, but I think the ranking is a bit biased and shows a lot of their favorite fighters repeating.  I would say its more of a collection of some of the fighters careers.  I would've liked to have seen more of some of the early fights with Mark Coleman and the Gracies as those are harder to come-by, as well as some other fighters - more Mir, etc...
All in all, for the price, its a good way to catch up on some really good fights.  I think from UFC-101 to 200 will be much better.",1356480000,,1146,4.268518518518518

A good mix of big names, great fights, and historic moments. The menu's are very easy to navigate, the original announcing and footage remains unedited, and the fights are just as good as you would expect them to be. Just remember this is NOT an Ultimate KO set, there will be decisions and ground fighting, so if all you want is to jump around and scream while you watch a guy get punched in the head, go buy the latest Wrestlemania instead.",1354838400,,560,4.394230769230769

You could argue all day about where Fight X should be rated and Fight Z was too high/low, but it doesn't matter in the end.  Most fights are in HD @16:9 while the classics are in their original 4:3 format.

It's fun to see the (de)evolution of fighters (see early GSP vs. post-Serra GSP) and some of the grueling battles Randy Couture has been involved with.  A decent amount of the fights have a few minutes of intro (like on the PPVs) then skip the introductions and get to fighting.  Once the winner is announced, you're off to the next one.  It would have been nice to see Rogan (or whomever) interview the participants after the bouts, but it's not a deal killer.

3926002,1,B002GU65M4,"Can you imagine if all sports treated their history this way?  If the early years of the NFL, or NBA, or MLB, where simply ignored?  If the people who ran those sports were willing to pretend the formative years of their respective organizations simply didn't happen?  Well... HERE YOU GO!  As mentioned by numerous other reviewers, this package is simply a bald faced lie.  When slapping this crap together the producers lopped off some of the most amazing battles MMA has ever scene in favor of the more recent crew of fighters - fighters who were under contract with the current owners of the UFC rather than the former.  This is disgraceful, and represents a gesture of profound disrespect to some Hall Of Fame caliber fighters who were the pioneers of this sport, now run by people with shockingly short memories.

Don't buy it.  Get the full DVD sets instead and watch those early Martial Artists work, and pick your OWN top 100 fights.  Trust me, plenty of your choices will include contests from those early days.  If all you saw was this, you wouldn't know anything at all...",1309564800,7,1084,4.6878306878306875
3926003,5,B002GU65M4,"Admittedly, I really enjoy MMA, and in particular, I think the UFC has done an excellent job over the years of making MMA a legitimate endeavor.  This disc set contains some classic fights that have happened during the UFC's storied history, and the value is why I give this product five stars.  (I picked my set up for $26 bucks.)

They keep the hype to a minimum for the most part and just give you the full fights.  Some post-fight interviews are included every now and again, and the editors did a good job selecting which made the cut and which did not.  The overall video quality is quite good, although I'm not a real stickler on that issue, so your opinion may differ.  The older fights are pretty much how you'd expect, and how I remember them when I first saw them on PPV back in the day (I've watched since UFC I, thinking to myself, ""How the HELL is this Gracie dude able to pull this off?!""  I thank the UFC for ultimately sparking my interest and participation in BJJ.)

In short, for $26 dollars, this set is a steal for even a casual fan of the UFC and MMA.  You can fill your DVD player carousel up with the discs, fill your refrigerator up with beer, load the grill up with tri-tip, and then invite your friends over to watch top-notch combat for the evening.  You will have fulfilled your hosting duties admirably.",1307577600,2,1333,4.382113821138211
3926004,5,B002GU65M4,"If you're wondering which of the many, many UFC titles are going to be right for you then this has to be, hands down the ultimate winning dvd/blu-ray set - if you're wondering about the value (this costs more than most UFC offerings) just look at the run time! 1600 minutes (Over 26 hours)! Over 3 hours on each of 8 dvds counting down to the best fight of all.

There doesn't seem to have been any favouritism in the selections, fighters shown at their best turn up in other places in the countdown being soundly defeated, the first dvd even had a Royce Gracie fight - and he was not the winner... Its certainly true that MMA has changed since the UFC started up, largely DUE to the existence of the UFC and popularity of mixed martial art competitions in the first place.

There isn't a lot of UFC on television where I live, so having this collection is going to be great for me - as the dvd's count down the quality of the fights just goes up and up and I'm only on the 3rd dvd so far. I know whenever I need inspiration in stand-up or applied jiu-jitsu I'll only need to reach for this one collection and I'll be able to see as many awesome match-ups as I could want.

The only people who might not appreciate it are those who have dutifully purchased the competitions as they've been going, in which case you might have seen a lot of the matches already. The only downside in watching the set is there isn't much background or aftermatch interviews/summaries, its straight on to the next match but when you've got 100 to get through you shouldn't begrudge them this so I can't take off a star just for that. Overall its a great buy, and for many people - it will be the only MMA set you ever need.",1304640000,3,1703,4.266253869969041

C Its as though they forgot something on this one...THE OUTER SLIPCASE, just 8 dvds set in jewel cases flopping around with a pamphlet (including several spelling errors and mislabeled fights) glued to the opening flap of the ""BIBLE like"" case. On the plus side it has nice matte and uv print job.

DVD quality...A Good quality mostly widescreen. - a few of the older fights don't look any better than my original ufc ppvs taped off satellite onto vhs upconverted to dvd.

The Fights...B TO C+ These to make it clear are not the 100 greatest ufc fights.

While the subjective nature of judging what is a great fight excludes the possibility of an accurate 100 greatest list, it would seem that ALL of the greatest ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONs of the ufc should be included.

However the THE ULTIMATE 100 GREATEST FIGHTS features the more recognizable fighters that the ufc is interested in promoting currently.
This is why there are none of the actual champions of the past like Taktarov, Severn, Ruas, Shamrock, Miletech, Bustamante, Mo Smith, Rutten, Jennum etc...
Also Dana white makes it a personal issue to screw fighters he doesn't like.

Get this... Taktarov vs Tank and Sakuraba(arguably the finest mw fighter ever)  vs Conan 1,2 are not even on this set!?!? that's blowing it.

It could almost be called the Chuck, Matt, Diego and GSP featuring the tuf dancers show.
The #1 fight is griffin vs Bonner? c'mon thats bs right there.
The following 7 fighters make up over %60 of the fights in this set... 13 fights for Liddell, 12 fights GSp, 11 fights hughes, 10 fights penn, 5 fights griffin, 6 fights Sanchez, 9 fights Randy. Several are decisions that you'd rather not watch again, like sherk vs hughes.

For what it is its a decent collection of more ""stand up oriented fights"" that would normally give it a B+ however, THE ULTIMATE 100 GREATEST FIGHTS fails to live up to its title, so it gets a C overall. I'd give it a B If it were called the 100 greatest fights of the new century, mainly because there is not much ground technique in these fights as selected by the biased dana white.",1289779200,6,2111,4.655913978494624
3926011,3,B002GU65M4,"The first and oft addressed issue with this set is that the list lacks some credibility.  Certain fights weren't eligible to make the list because the winning fighters were on the outs with Dana White at the time.  While Dana has done great things for the sport, this kind of manipulation is eventually going to be the thing that keeps this sport from becoming truly mainstream, the NFL wouldn't get away with that.

That said, the fights that are included are for the most part great fights, the audio and video are the best available for each fight.  Keep in mind a number of the early fights were shot in 4:3 format and in a quality only slightly better than VHS.

My biggest complaints about the set are in the actual quality of the DVD production.  The menus are incredibly basic with a painful lack of useful information in them.  Just seems lazy.

Even worse, though kind of funny, the discs themselves are mislabeled ""Disc 6"" is in fact Disc 5! Zuffa really aught to be able to hire a production team that can avoid silly mistakes like that!

Overall, it's a satisfactory product with a lot of great fights for the price!  But it is a little lacking in polish.",1289520000,11,1168,4.492890995260663
3926012,3,B002GU65M4,"This set features many classic fights and is a worthy addition to any fight fans library, but is mainly targeted for the casual fan.

With that said, the set is missing many important, or otherwise, some of their greatest fights. When the concept of this set was created, SpikeTV listed X number of fights on their website and the fans voted the order. The top 100 from the poll were included in this set, in the order which they were voted. This created much controversy within the MMA community, when some of their biggest stars from the past and several key fights were nowhere found on the list of fights that the UFC allowed the fans to vote for.

Zuffa/UFC/Dana White decided to re-write history, by not including fights from fighters who were on bad terms with them or left to compete in rival promotions. Instead they only included bouts which shows their former draws lose to their current fighters (Tito Ortiz, Tim Sylvia, Nick Diaz, Josh Barnett, Ken Shamrock, and Vitor Belfort) or just pretend that others don't exist (Frank Shamrock & Andrei Arlovski). By them doing that, they ruined the credibility of a release that truly could have been something special.

Most notably are the lack of any Frank Shamrock fights (the UFC's first ever 5X MW/LHW Champ and their poster boy of the late 90's). Where's his stunning debut against the undefeated 2X Pan Ams champ Kevin Jackson? Where's his first title defense that ended with an absolutely brutal career ending KO? Where's the exciting grudge match against John Lober? Most importantly, where is his title defense against Tito Ortiz? It's a travesty that his title defense against Tito Ortiz is not included. The fight alone is widely regarded as the greatest fight of the UFC's pre-Zuffa era and is still regarded as not only one of the UFC's greatest fights, but as one of the greatest title fights in the short history of this sport we call MMA.

Shame on you Zuffa, UFC, and Dana White for trying to bury the past and re-write history to satisfy self-promotion, while giving the fighters, who made the UFC what it is today, a slap on the face.

1. There is NOT any fights by the following fighters

Maurice Smith
Frank Shamrock
Marco Ruas
Bas Ruten

2. this set has 1 fight by Kevin Randelman where he loses to Chuck Lidell, and two fights (if memory serves) of Tito Ortiz where he loses to Randy Coutoure, and Chuck Liddell

I cannot believe the great fight between Nick Diaz and Robbie Lawler where the grappler Diaz knocks out the striker Lawler. I would have put that fight in the top 10 myself.

3926025,4,B002GU65M4,"I already have it. I won't say how, but most of you probably already know how. None the less, here are my thoughts...for what they're worth. Since Ama*on doesn't delineate I will, I have the Blu-ray set and apparently, there are some differences in the extra content between the two so I can't comment about the standard DVD set. The HD video quality is all you can expect it to be. Older fights are kept in 4:3 and look like you'd expect, old....at times ancient, and the newer (obviously 16:9) look great. People who say this isn't great quality must not understand the process. These are live events. They're not going to look like film or high def DV cameras using 'film' lenses. So disregard the complaints about the video quality.

The reason I give it 4 vs 5 stars is some of the fights included, and some of the fights omitted. As far as missing fights, first, and foremost Lesnar vs. Mir II. Which is clearly left off because the 'UFC 100 Making History' disc has just been released. To me, this is BS. How can this be omitted but Lesnar vs. Mir I be included? (and towards the top of the list no less.) That fight was a lot of things, but one of the greatest? No, not even close. I would have accepted it's inclusion as a pre-text for II. But, without it, it seems pointless. I should point out that I'm not a fan of Lesnar or Mir, they both talk way too much trash and lack one of the main qualities that sets MMA apart. Respect. But I digress.  A few of the fights included, just don't measure up. For instance one fight, which is essentially a wrestling match and ends in a decision. Perhaps a great match, but not very 'MIXED'. And there are a couple of boxing matches which would be hard to even pass off as kick-boxing. Maybe I'm being too particular, but I like seeing well rounded fights, with well rounded fighters. The bottom line is, if you love MMA you will love this set.

8370029,3,B002GU65M4,"This could have been great, but the UFC seems set on controlling the narrative rather than producing an actual Top 100.

However, this is still a good set. If you get it for a decent price, you can get 80+ great fights for not much money. Some of the fights do not belong in the set, and some of the UFC's greatest/most historic fights are ignored.

I bought it years ago at full price and was disappointed. I bought it a couple of months ago for $20 and was pleased. It just could/should have been so much better.",1486771200,3,514,4.23469387755102
