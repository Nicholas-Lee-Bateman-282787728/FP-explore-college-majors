5229927,4,B00911L7VA,This was a much different story than I was expecting but we really enjoyed it.  My sister is a film student and had many criticisms of the movie but the story was one of encouragement and courage during a very difficult situation.  God Bless America.,1354752000,,250,4.533333333333333
5229928,4,B00911L7VA,"Although hard not to compare with the first episode of Saints and Soldiers, I also liked this one as well. The story is told differently, more flash-backs and plenty of action but it didn't feel like it compared to the first movie. The character development is slow, but worth it. The end of this film is the highlight of the film and very similar to Ryan's student film back in college. It really ties up the loose ends of the film. Really about the humanity of the soldiers that fight and not just about negative stereotypes about Nazis and Germans  like in other WWII films.",1353715200,13,577,4.495238095238095
5229929,3,B00911L7VA,"I truly enjoyed Saints and Soldiers released in 2003. This episode does not compare to that one. My first problem was seeing Corbin Allred in this movie. ""Deacon"" was a powerful character in the 1st episode and I could not get passed the fact Corbin was a different character in this episode. Also, the story here does not have the same impact as the 1st episode. This was an OK movie but does not compare to Saints and Soldiers, or maybe I just can't get past ""Deacon"" being someone else.",1353283200,7,489,4.444444444444445
5229930,5,B00911L7VA,"What a powerful story of redemption!

I just saw the movie in the theaters and could not wait to get home to pre-order the DVD.

This is a story to be thoughtfully considered many times, on many levels.  Some will see only the action, others will marvel at the authentic war machine, the planes and tanks and soldiers.  Some will say that the virtue of this story is that it is ""real"", a portrayal of ordinary souls trying to maintain their decency amidst the ugliness of war.

But there is a much more powerful theme.  It's been said that every good story is a story of personal redemption, the transformation of an individual from flawed humanity to someone with a spark of the Divine.  And we see that, in Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed.  There were scenes in this movie where you could feel the transformation taking place.  It gripped your heart and wrenched emotions that you don't often feel in movies.  I'm not sure I've ever seen finer acting as in those moments when these soldiers had to confront who they had been, and choose who they wanted to become.

The film is rated PG-13 for war violence and would be appropriate for mature teens.  Unlike many films with war violence, there was no swearing, no ugliness towards women. Some of the worst brutality is implied, which is much more effective story-telling. There were explosions and combat and blood... without gore... Plenty of action and tension but plenty of the human dimension, too.  It is far more than a ""war"" or ""action"" movie.  The redemption theme should provide ample fodder for family and classroom and post-movie discussions.",1348876800,96,1608,4.737410071942446

5229946,5,B00911L7VA,"I liked this movie.  It made sense.  The action and suspense were sustained.  War is not a game and not a bit like a game
played on a video setup.  People are scared, hurting, confused, and they can get shot and/or killed.  There are good and there are
beyond ugly.  This movie addressed that with skill and restraint.  All the mechanics of making a good movie were present: acting,

5230056,2,B00911L7VA,"The film is not realistic as military facts, strategies and weapons are often incorrect.  Obviously didn't have a historian on the staff who made the movie.

There is no way a military consultant was used in the making of this film,  at best maybe an Air Force supply sergeant. The dialogue, banter and tactics are just piss poor and utterly unbelievable.

5230088,2,B00911L7VA,"Low budget movies like this one can be worth watching if the characters and plot meet a decent standard.  That didn't happen in ""Sinners and Saints: Airborne Creed.""  The acting and cinematography for the most part were not bad.  The script was the main weakness.  No compelling premise or story arc.  No clear-cut protagonist.  Miscellaneous weird points:  If you have to shoot in California, keep the dead giveaways out of the camera angles (e.g. lines of hills with green trees and brown grass adjacent to broad valleys).  Also the picture was dedicated to Harland ""Bud"" Curtis, a character in the movie who is KIA.  Somewhat moving true story element?  No.  Googling reveals that Curtis lived to old age.  The movie is loosely based on the book compiled by his son, *Letters from a Paratrooper.*  Almost creepy to imply to an audience that your film honors a real person gave his life for his country when he didn't.  This movie had its moments, so doesn't deserve a one star rating, but it could have been much better with the same cast and budget but a different script.",1424908800,,1076,4.71505376344086

Very well crafted for such a low budget - only ""mistake"" I found was the sound effect that accompanied the ""Bird Dog"" observation plane that flew by as it was being pursued by the BF-109 - sounded like a P-51 Mustang as it flew by, not a 2-cylinder ""putt-putt"".  Also - none of the usual (and accurate) raw GI language (but not all soldiers are profane). OK, nit-picking over.  Beautifully shot - you really felt like you were there.  Real, well-developed characters.  VERY well acted by folks you've never heard of.  ""Hats off"" to the re-enactors who devoted their time to contribute at their own expense.

I do not know where production got such a poor screenplay. Terrible. An offense to serious film making.",1401840000,7,533,4.621052631578947
5230179,3,B00911L7VA,"It is definitely not as good as Saints and Soldiers.  It used the same format of story line, didn't get as much tension at the critical points; it never developed the tension so I knew when the dangerous part was.

Also, using the same actor threw me off.  I thought it was a pre-quel of Saints and Soldier.  But, it isn't.

I'm actually disappointed that I bought it and that I sent it to someone else as a present.

The seller was fine, but movie was not.",1401753600,2,457,4.195402298850575
5230180,2,B00911L7VA,"It's by the same basic team who did the 2005 Saints and Soldiers.  An action story involving 3 US paratroopers who team up with French resistance while trying to meet their unit so they can complete their original objective.  The action is inter cut with flashbacks of each of the 3 soldiers lives.  The action is okay, the character development is lacking, and the over all story is not as compelling as other movies.

I am a huge WWII amateur historian.  I prefer stories that are more historically accurate. I do appreciate how The Band Of Brothers Series has allowed the re-enactor movement to participate in these projects and help the over all look, feel and realism of these modern historical films such as this one.  I do not agree with the entertainment industry, that it can tell a better story than real life.

If you have an affinity for WWII movies, this one may certainly appeal to you.  If you prefer movies based more on history, then this movie maybe considered as a pass for you.",1401753600,2,997,4.593220338983051

5230188,2,B00911L7VA,"If the original ""Saints and Soldiers"" can be considered a hit, then this ""prequel"" is a solid miss. The acting is acceptable. The observation about the telephone notwithstanding, the uniforms and firearms shown in the film were amazingly authentic. The special effects are reasonable given the budget the filmmakers had to work with. A number of other reviewers have pointed out that this film was ""obviously"" made on a low budget, but that of itself is not a valid criticism. Anyone could do better, or more at any rate, if an extra couple hundred million dollars fell on their head, but the art of the ""art"" is to produce something good with whatever resources available. The problem is in the script and the choreographing of the battle scenes - which were obviously not vetted by the military advisers - or, their advice was ignored. Part of the film has a ""moral"", that the Biblical Golden Rule ""Do unto others as..."" works even on the battlefield among men who are trying to kill each other. The concomitant to this is that ""enemies"" are also human; very much like us. The other part of the film is the conventional ""Hollywood"" war movie were a small bunch of ""our heroes"" gun down an endless supply of one-dimensional ""nasty Natzees"" who, when they shoot, never seem to be able hit an Allied soldier or miss an unarmed victim. Needless to say, these two parts don't mesh very well and the story just comes across as kind of dumb.",1385510400,14,1436,4.65748031496063

5230190,5,B00911L7VA,"I rented this movie primarily because I like the original Saints & Soldiers so much, and I read a few good reviews of this sequel.  And I was not disappointed!  This is a powerful story of combat in Southern France (August,1944) right after the Allied invasion of that area (Operation Dragoon).  It follows several paratroopers as they gradually find each other in enemy territory.  There are many plot twists and various scenes that are intense and riveting!  But most of all, it was told in a very human perspective from BOTH SIDES, and really illustrates the depravity and nobleness of men in ways that I will not soon forget!",1380499200,8,629,4.73394495412844

Yet this second movie, although good, made you believe they were directing it more towards the Catholic Religion.... BY ALL MEANS, this is not a bad thing.. yet after the first movie, I was expecting a similar religious pointing.  I suppose they are wanting to reach out to all Christian faiths, which if true, would raise this to 5 stars.",1379376000,3,436,4.493670886075949

5230193,4,B00911L7VA,"Once again, these guys do a phenomenal job of making a great movie with a very small budget, but, in my opinion, their first movie was much better.  This is based on a true story, but it gets a little too preachy at times and is a good bit slower than the first movie.  I had a few problems with some of the equipment they were using, namely that only one of the three paratroopers was actually wearing a paratrooper helmet, but hey, I'm picky about that kind of stuff.

Over all, this isn't a bad little movie and if you're a WWII buff you will enjoy it.  If you're not, then you'll probably get bored with this one pretty quickly.  The camera work is fantastic, the sets are great, and one of these days, this crew is going to get some major money behind them and make the greatest war epic ever filmed - they know what they're doing behind the cameras and it really shows in their films.",1377734400,,890,4.211764705882353
5230194,4,B00911L7VA,"This is a good war flick about American paratroopers in southern france. That invasion came later than d day and it was a sporadic campaign just as it's pictured here.  The axis just didn't have enough troops to put up big large scale battles in most of the push north. So this is a pretty accurate and it's not a horrible movie as some have claimed! In fact , it's not inaccurate or false in any way. It's just doesn't have a lot of money , but then the tank looks pretty much like a mark v in this film. Which shows they did try to go for realism. It is not boring. As it rings true and that's good enough for me.  AIRBORNE! .  This looks far better in HD. So that's the way to watch it.",1377216000,,689,3.9782608695652173

For what is basically a low budget film I was very impressed with the production values, acting, and historic authenticity shown in this film. Eonough character development so you cared about the 3 soldiers presented, yet not so much that it sowed the film down at all. Just enough action too.
