2126748,5,B0002VEZ30,If you have American Pimp this is a good addition to the collection,1120694400,,67,4.230769230769231
2126749,1,B0002VEZ30,"Well, If you saw the original then there is no point getting this pointless add-on, just a gimic by the Hughes Brothers to pump more money out of the same product by scraping discarded film-clips from the floor and throwing them together and giving them a new title.

The original was slickly edited to create a rather seemless documentary - in this unfortunate follow-up we see the Pimps as they truly are - unable to create a single coherant sentence.  What you'll hear is one full hour of sentences like,  ""And then I met this Ho U-know-what-I'm-Sayin, and we were vibing  U-know-what-I'm-Sayin and she was trying to play U-know-what-I'm-Sayin so I put my Pimp moves on her U-know-what-I'm-Sayin and soon she was inline with my pimpin U-know-what-I'm-Sayin and it was tight U-know-what-I'm-Sayin"", or you get Rosebudd spending 5 full minutes trying to figure out which hotel one of his hoes was murdered in - extrememly boring stuff.

Ironically, pimps talk about the need to have good verbal skills and all, but after listenting to this it was obvious that most 3 year olds have better verbal skills than they do.  Also there was nothing ""raw"" about this really except that you hear the word that rhymes with witch about 3,000 times, but they already did that in the original.  There is a long interview with Snoop Dogg but it's not very interesting at all, and certainly not enlightening.

As for the soundtrack, I havn't listened to it yet but you could download those songs from the internet for free so why spend money buying this CD?

All in all this is a very sad effort U-know-what-I'm-Sayin ?",1111190400,50,1604,4.76173285198556

8033175,5,B0002VEZ30,"Great Soundtrack, So many classic joints on one playlist with snippets of the movie in between each song. Also the Raw Outtakes were real informative and really interesting to listen too, with a special interview with Snoop Dogg.",1454889600,,229,5.052631578947368

8033178,2,B0002VEZ30,This was not a very good movie.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.,1409961600,,76,4.066666666666666
8033179,5,B0002VEZ30,This is additional outtakes and for a collector you would want to have it. It's not as organized as the original film which when you think about it ....it shouldn't be. The Hughes Brothers do it again.,1401494400,,201,4.45945945945946

8033181,5,B0002VEZ30,It was so startling because I've never seen anything so real. And the music was just fascinating and soulful. I liked this very much.,1360368000,,133,4.583333333333333
8033182,5,B0002VEZ30,Funny movie. The product was exactly as described. Im really happy with my purchase. I will highly consider this vendor for my next purchase.,1351814400,,141,4.916666666666667
8033183,2,B0002VEZ30,I love American Pimp and was hoping for some amazing bonus footage with this DVD but aside from a few moments it is very obvious why this material didn't make the cut the first time around. Probably worth a rental if you're a huge AP fan but not to own. If you have DVD money burning a whole in your pocket just buy another copy of American Pimp and give it to a friend or loved-one. (The soundtrack is pretty good though.),1287014400,6,423,4.170731707317073
