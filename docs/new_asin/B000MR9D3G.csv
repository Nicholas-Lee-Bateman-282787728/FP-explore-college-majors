This volume is the most tragic in the series and contains a plot twist you may not see coming.  Roy finally learns the identity of his long lost daughter, and discovers she is not as far away as he believed.  In fact she's living under his roof as a freeloader.  The evidence seems circumstantial, but they all line up and point to the truth.  Rose finds an old LP album in Roy's collection with a song she has known all her life, a song her adoptive family never taught her, a song that was much loved by her real mother.  Rose bursts into tears.  Rose's brothers present Roy the childhood clothing she was wearing when their father brought her home, and Roy instantly recognizes the outfit as Rita's.  The truth is hard for Rose to bear, but she eventually learns acceptance.  She doesn't want Roy to call her Rita, a name she can't remember and has never used, but she does accept Roy, finally, as her father.  Sadly, the violent, unpredictable world they both live in makes this reunion of father and daughter painfully short.  A mad scientist accidentally unleashes another Blast Fall and devastates the lives of all the major characters.  Unlike other ""Robot Girl"" animes, this series has a lot of heart and well developed characters, story arcs, etc, and is not just mindless battle action.  There is action aplenty, but it doesn't detract from or replace the actual plot.  Even the ""slow"" episodes that focus on character relationships are engaging and fun to watch.  The cast are delightful and full of veteran FUNimation and ADV Films voice talents, including Chris Sabat, Coleen Clinkenbeard, Carrie Savage, and Chris Patton.",1240185600,,1655,4.8021201413427566
