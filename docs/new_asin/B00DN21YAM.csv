8594628,5,B00DN21YAM,"Full disclosure, I wrote the other Tigers movie review on here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-Movie-The-Tigers-Hi-London-Limited-Low-Priced-Edition-Japan-DVD-TDV-24004D/dp/B00DN1WZ1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese Movie - The Tigers Hi! London (Limited Low-Priced Edition) [Japan DVD] TDV-24004D</a>

This movie suffers from the same extremely minor aspect ratio issue (I believe they squashed the movie just a little horizontally to make it fit 16:9); the image in that review illustrates it better than any screenshot from this movie could; it also has the vivid colors (which is good).

The plot is an entirely fake account of how the Tigers became a band, with them accidentally running away from home (by hiding in a moving train from their parents, who are trying to cut their hair by force), ending up in Tokyo, sneaking into a disco that just happens to have a full set of instruments set up, and playing music that's so good the manager just has to hire them...

Not quite as wacky as the Tigers selling their souls to a demon, but with less Tigers personality politics, more accessible to the casual GS or 60s movie fan. I didn't enjoy it as much as Hi London, but I'm biased towards Shiro.
