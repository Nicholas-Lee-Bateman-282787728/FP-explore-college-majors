8429703,4,B00005NZ5J,"My 18mos old son has this video on his list of top three best videos (it's not Elmo, so it can't be his absolute favorite). He watches from beginning to end and screams ""Weeeee!"" whenever any vehicle takes air. It's got motorcycles, and snow plows, tractors, and all kinds of moving machinery. The production value is just fine for this audience and the building of a truck from scratch is still interesting even after 100 showings. There is no violence in the video (as in cars crashing into each other) which I'm glad of.
It has a couple of cute songs that we sing along with, and most importantly, the men in the family will sit and watch with my son without feeling that they are being de-masculated. Sometimes they will even talk about what is going on in this Trucks with the tot, which is what it's all about. Grownup men don't ""do"" Elmo, I've found. This Trucks video is good for daddies and toddlers to bond over.",1016668800,3,922,4.461538461538462
