7800074,2,1599876183,"It is just a doctor conversations with patients about sex, nothing else. So there is nothing except boring, boring, and boring. and if you like to fall to sleep fast, you can put this movie in your dvd, and after five minutes you will be in deep sleep.",1398902400,,252,4.270833333333333
7800075,1,1599876183,"My girlfriend and I got this video thinking it would give us a few new ideas. I don't think the word 'sex' was used once, let alone anything suggestive. The cover of the DVD shows couples kissing etc but none of that was in the actual footage. THE most descriptive part was when a drawing of the outer vagina was shown. Not even an actual picture, just a drawing much like the instructions you get with a put together yourself TV stand. There was really nothing intimate about this video, but it might be a good way to not actually have 'the talk' with your kids, just show them this. Then again, they might still come and ask you questions.",1365033600,,641,4.35
7800076,2,1599876183,"I was highly disappointed in the video. I was expecting some good advice and descriptive imagery that was more of a ""how-to"" on improving sexual intimacy. There were boring, uninformative interviews and generalities only.....I found it to be not worth the money.",1363651200,,262,5.261904761904762
