8281086,5,B001B1877K,I recommend UFC vol1 to 20 for all martial artists. They displayed fighters with different styles and disiplines. They can be used as a case study to see what styles consistently dominate fights. Volume 10 does just that. Mark Coleman was amazing. He showed incredible grappling skills. This is definitely a collectors item!,1454198400,,324,5.132075471698113
8281087,5,B001B1877K,"It was very important that the Gracies broadcast to a broad audience the importance of ground fighting in UFC 1 . But it was even more important for wrestlers like Dan Severn and Don Frye to come in and slam, mangle, and destroy people. UFC 10 solidifies this with the debut of the great Mark Coleman.
  The 6'1 240 pound brick outhouse blasts his way through all opposition with nothing but wrestling and a street fighter attitude. His first fight is a statement, his opponent is one of those ""street style"" and military ""survival"" super super deadly karate masters that (really did) teach the Marines and Israeli commandos in unarmed combat. The Karate guy is skilled and has grappling skills, but the guy who knows nothing but wrestling and how to throw a punch takes him down and gets him in saddle ride and beats his face in.

All that wrestling mojo aside you will see a real treat on this DVD. The fight between Don Frye and Mark Coleman is one of the greatest displays of heart in any combat sport EVER. Buy it my friends, and crack some beers and invite friends.",1402272000,2,1071,4.510309278350515
8281088,5,B001B1877K,This one is great! If you like the early UFC's you gotta get 1-30 at the least! It is worth it!,1390780800,,95,3.5714285714285716
8281089,3,B001B1877K,"Long on history, short on some of the better fights, what UFC 10 is probably mostly known for is the introduction of renowned fighter Mark ""the Hammer"" Coleman and his subsequent win of the tourney over an exhausted but still dangerous Don ""the Predator"" Frye.  Frye's loss was honestly probably precipitated by the bloody and brutal but time-consuming and draining beating he administered to Mark Hall in the first round.  I mean, ouch!

The other thing that I remember was wondering if a certain fight was thrown (between Frye and contender Brian Johnston) when an obviously tired Frye got a takedown and Johnston tapped out when it looked like Frye was going for some type of armbar/ lock.  The tap looked like it occurred just a bit early, before the pressure was applied.  But what do I know?  I'm not a fighter.  But that fight ended in a way that most fights don't and it made me wonder...

Also, ""Big"" John McCarthy also talked about being disappointed to learn that a couple fights were being thrown in favor of big business.  That blight should never happen, but it may have here.  After all, throughout the event, the anticipation was for the final fight to be between Frye and Coleman so...?",1376438400,,1203,4.685714285714286
8281090,5,B001B1877K,Good event that is starting to change from the previous events. More and more fighters are gaining experience in the cage and it is getting quite interesting.,1321056000,,158,4.888888888888889
8281091,5,B001B1877K,"All the 6 fights are raw, exciting, bloody, realistic and rivetingly entertaining. There is a  couple of surprises. For example, the fight between Gary Goodrich and Don Frye proves that being 20 pounds heavier than your opponent does not always guarantee a victory.

I get more satisfaction watching these fights than Bruce Lee's movies. Those movies were good in the old days. However, today, they look slow, and over-acting.

I own this DVD. It deservers 5 stars.",1260489600,,465,5.012987012987013
