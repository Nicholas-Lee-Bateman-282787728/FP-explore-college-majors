1654757,5,B00005R86U,"As with all of the Standard Deviants educational series, the presentation is zany, and what you need to know is simply explained.  It holds your interest so you don't get bored with the dry subject matter.
To compare DVD format to regular video, the DVD has much more versatility because of its interactive testing capabilities. The viewer has an option to test and review the subject matter by using the remote keypad.  These little tests are helpful for making sure you understand the points covered.
The Pre-Algebra DVD covers math terminology, explaining each term so that it's easy-to-understand. Then they show you how it works.  It takes the mystery out of math terms that intimidate all of us who didn't learn the ""new math"" during our school years.  By viewing this DVD, I experienced a personal breakthrough in my struggle to learn the ""new math"".  It was a tremendous help to me. I highly recommend it to others who struggle with this subject, especially parents and grandparents who found themselves unable to understand their kid's math homework.  This subject brings it together for us so we can understand what our kids are learning.",992995200,53,1148,4.922279792746114

7952093,5,B00005R86U,I wish I had The Standard Deviants around when I was in high school. They are fun and entertaining and packed with great tips to help your studant achieve higher scores in math. I homeschool my children and I have used the Standard Deviants for years as a supplement to their curriculem. In my opinion my children learned more from these dvd's than from other sources. My children did well in college and on their SAT tests. They said that the format presented in the Standard Deviants helped them remember the order of operations. I have recently purchased a new set for my fifteen year old along with SAT prep dvd's. She enjoys them all.,1366675200,3,639,4.565217391304348
