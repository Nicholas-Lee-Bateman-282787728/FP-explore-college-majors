2883044,5,B000S6LS6Q,"I've been fascinated with ""Dirty Jobs"" since the show came out on the Discovery Channel. Host, Mike Rowe's willingness to go spend a day doing the jobs of people we take for granted (charcoal makers, sewer inspectors, hot tar roofers and just all kinds of unheard of and thoughtless jobs that keep American's enjoying life) has absolutely both intrigued me and astonished me that there are so, so many -- well -- dirty jobs out there! Add in Mike's sense of humor, and you have a show you just have to watch.

I was and am thrilled to have this collection, and I do hope that it's just the first of many.

Thanks Mike. And, thanks to all of you who make our lives a little bit easier.",1193788800,8,684,4.3359375
2883045,5,B000S6LS6Q,"This is a great collection of some of the Dirty Jobs programs as viewed on Discovery Channel. Gives an insight into some of the worst jobs that some of us do for a living. Expertly hosted by Mike Rowe who is not afraid to get stuck in, and trys his hand at a wide range of dirty jobs which most of us would avoid at all costs. Mike throws in a bit of humour which makes the programs even more interesting. At times we are thankful there is not 'smell-a-vision'!.
Can't wait for collection 2 to come out on DVD.",1193529600,5,510,4.11
2883046,5,B000S6LS6Q,"Thank goodness there are people willing to do (and even enjoy) these jobs. Our society would descend into chaos without them. The host is outstanding. Mike Rowe clearly respects these workers, but he also is great at deadpan humor. Thoroughly entertaining and informative. This collection is certainly a better value than buying individual episodse on DVD, though I wish Dirty Jobs was available on iTunes like Mythbusters. I certainly hope that these Discovery Channel collections will eventually include all episodes. It's hard to be sure because they do not follow the standard seasonal organization of most other TV DVDs.",1192752000,11,625,5.3232323232323235

2883056,4,B000S6LS6Q,I love this dvd! I absolutely adore Mike Rowe and the Dirty Jobs show. My only negative about this dvd is it doesn't have subtitles. I frequently watch the show late at night when my daughter is asleep and I don't want to wake her up so I use subtitles. It sucks these don't offer subtitles! Otherwise I'm very happy with this purchase!,1397865600,,336,4.349206349206349
2883057,4,B000S6LS6Q,"Like everyone else, I love Mike Rowe and his Dirty Jobs series and was very bummed the series ended. Now I don't have access to Dirty Jobs on TV or streaming, so I wanted to try to pick up the complete series on DVD. This task is harder than it sounds for the following reasons:

(1) A ""collection"" is different from a ""season"". There were presumably about 160 episodes made (according to IMDb and Wikipedia), but each ""collection"" is only about 10 episodes. So buying all 8 collections will get you only about half the total episodes made.

(2) There is lots of confusion amongst amazon, discovery, Wikipedia, and IMDb about which episodes actually constitute a season. And again, a collection is not the same thing as a season. However, the collections available for purchase on discovery are indeed identical to those on amazon (but they're cheaper on amazon by about one-third).

(3) For some reason, seven out of eight collections on amazon are titled by number (1,2,3, etc.) except for collection 5, which is titled by its spelled-out number instead (""five""). I have no idea what that's all about. Additionally, collection five is the only collection not currently available for purchase on discovery.

So, folks like me who just want to purchase all the episodes on DVD seem to be SOL. I could watch some episodes for free on Amazon Prime and buy more episodes, but neither of my internet-enabled video devices is supported by Amazon Prime. And who knows how long free episodes will be free, whether they might be removed, or whether they'd disappear altogether once our beloved ""cloud"" concept finally collapses under its own weight.

However, there's one bit of good news: if you're just looking for as much Dirty Jobs content as possible per dollar spent, as of 1/24/2014 discovery has a collection of 25 episodes on 7 discs with 18 hours of content for 80% off: just $10 instead of $50.  It's mostly ""season"" 2, MINUS the four special episodes: ""Really Dirty Animals"", ""Dirtiest Machines on the Planet"", ""Crew's Cruise"", and ""Creepy Slimy and Just Plain Weird"", but INCLUDING the last four episodes of season 1. Are you as confused as I am, yet?

I'll add to this review later if I can make any more sense of episodes/seasons/jobs/specials.

2883058,5,B000S6LS6Q,"I love this show and Mike Rowe.  It is very entertaining and it has alot of laughs.  He is very willing to do anything and sometimes he just can't do the job.  It makes you appreciate people who do these jobs every day.  The dvd was over way too fast, it was that enjoyable. HIs mistakes and outtakes really make the show.  This is the second Dirty Jobs I purchased from Amazon.  You really can't find them anywhere else, especially at these prices.  I will be ordering more soon.",1388102400,,480,4.325842696629214

I would not call us fuel tank 'cleaners' (I guess they got that from the resealing job), we actually replace the parts inside the tank among other things.  Nice to know they are recognizing people with filthy jobs.

I do think sewer inspector is one of the dirtiest jobs.  Glad I don't do that!",1231718400,,420,4.2

Best way to learn......through humor...& Mike Rowe, his crew & Discovery Channel do an excellent job in this!  Yes, some students gagged at the ""Sewer Inspector"" piece but they also admitted they never even thought about the necessity of someone doing this.

2883084,5,B000S6LS6Q,"""Dirty Jobs"" is perhaps the most entertaining show currently on television. Every week affable host Mike Rowe does a couple of utterly revolting jobs that make civilization possible, yet are mortifyingly unpleasant. ""Collection 1"" features some of the very best episodes from the series, and will make almost everyone grateful that they do what they do for a living.

While all the episodes are great, there are a few that are absolutely extraordinary.

""Monkey Caretaker"" is one of the most famous episodes. It turns out that monkeys can be extremely difficult to deal with, and so can the caretaker. In the end several injuries ensue, including an especially nasty bite to the sound man's leg.

""Ostrich Rancher"" is extraordinary, if for no other reason than seeing Mike trying to put a sock over an angry ostrich's head.

""Alpaca Shearer"" is one of my favorite episodes. It is actually one of the cleaner jobs (if you can deal with the high-velocity alpaca spit), but the conclusion is one of the most priceless pieces of television genius I have ever seen. (I'm not going to spoil it for you!)

""Shark Patroller"" is from the special ""Jobs That Bite."" While that episode is actually one of my least favorites overall, the concept of jumping in the ocean with a bunch of freshly-chummed sharks to test a new shark repellant is amazing. I wasn't wild about the shark autopsy: I had to dissect a shark in an upper level biology lab in college, and this brought back several unpleasant memories for me. It's also really the only thing I would say was not suitable for small children on the disc.

""Fuel Tank Cleaner"" gives any viewer a new-found respect both for aircraft mechanics and the real meaning of claustrophobia.

""Disaster Cleaner Upper"" is my second favorite episode, and features the efforts of a valiant team to recover a basement from the effects of a demonically possessed toilet which dumped the contents of the entire neighborhood's sewer lines into an unsuspecting house. This one grossed me out, especially the use of the garden trowel.

""Casino Food Recycler"" is, hands down, my favorite episode of the series so far. A kindly and funny old farmer in Las Vegas recycles food scraps to raise pigs on. The totally novel operation is at once amazing and disgusting, but undeniably ecologically sensible.

Throughout each of these Mike is good-natured, intelligent, and helpful. Well, at least as helpful as he can be. I will give him one thing: there is absolutely nothing he won't do, and I admire that greatly, as some of them I know I would not be up for (changing light bulbs atop a suspension bridge comes to mind). Mike seems like a genuinely nice guy, and is the ideal host of this show: I appreciate his geniality and wit, but even more I appreciate his genuine respect for these people who do some really, really dirty jobs.

When I first heard the concept for this show I thought I would find it boring and formulaic: nothing could be further from the truth. I find it absorbing, entertaining, and educational. I highly recommend this set to anyone and everyone.",1199145600,28,3088,4.787593984962406
