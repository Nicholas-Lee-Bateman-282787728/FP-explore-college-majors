8476941,5,B005KMBXKY,"I was amazed at how useful just about every minute of the videos were.  I went back through them several times.  Then, a few months later, watched them again and they were still great.  I've read or watched dozens of books or videos on basketball skills, drills, and coaching.  After reading the first few books on the subject, it seems that throughout each subsequent book, I find a few new nuggets--often subtle details or a different way to look at something a previous resource covered.  I expected the same (a few bits of new useful info across the entire DVD) when I got Coach Sokaitis' Youth League DVDs.  After a few minutes of frantically trying to take notes and keep up with the DVD, I became a master of the pause and rewind to try to absorb all the usefull info in there.  These are great and definitely worth watching.",1396656000,,832,4.506666666666667
