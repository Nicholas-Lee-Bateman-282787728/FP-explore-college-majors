6649459,4,B00NGAJHF0,"Hated Miami Vice and not a big Don Johnson fan, but I loved him and Nash Bridges.  Doesn't make sense to me be I really enjoyed this series.  But it sucks big time that seasons 4-6 were not released individually.  I have already purchased those and do not want to purchase again to get the whole series and $233 is way too much money for six seasons of any series.",1412899200,5,364,4.171428571428572
6649460,4,B00NGAJHF0,I ALREADY HAVE SEASONS 1 THRU 3 SO WHY WOULD I  BUY THE COMPLETE SERIES???,1412553600,6,74,3.933333333333333
6649461,3,B00NGAJHF0,"Good that this series is finally (?) going to be released in it's entireity, and now the disc count (27) would seem to be correct (originally the description said it was on four discs (!), which would be impossible. Just a shame that the price has been hiked yet again - starting to look expensive for UK buyers who have to pay import duty AND Royal Mail's rip-off ""handling charge"" - especially if you already own the first three series.",1412121600,6,438,4.4875
6649462,5,B00NGAJHF0,"Watched and loved this series. Will seasons 4.5 and six be released? It would not be fair to those who have purchased 1-3 and have waited for the release of the other three.
Series was great with a blend of drama and humor.
Remember Joe directing traffic and the episode where Nash believes his daughter was killed?
The chemistry of the characters is why Nash Bridges was popular.
The NCIS series is very much like Nash and still going strong.",1411862400,7,443,4.55
6649463,5,B00NGAJHF0,"This series is a wonderful work of art and is one of my all time favorites. I've seen each episode multiple times and can watch them over and over. The frustration of the last 3 seasons not being released seems to be finally coming to fruition, and hopefully we will finally have this great show to watch  whenever we choose. The tvshowsondvd website is a seller of pirated dvd's which are recorded from USA Networks and then transferred to DVD. I know because before realizing that I ordered the entire series from them and they are truly  of horrible quality and the shows are cut so much to allow for commercials that some scenes are completely missing. So I would take what rumors you hear from them with a grain of salt. I am thrilled that this show is finally being finished on DVD.",1411689600,2,788,4.465277777777778
6649464,5,B00NGAJHF0,"I'm excited to see this coming out but sadly there is no offical report on this release, other then a listing on Amazon. Hopefully they have got the rights to put the original music back into the series, not counting on that however. Just be excited to see it again. Right in time for my birthday (which is around the corner from this release)",1411516800,3,343,4.375
6649465,5,B00NGAJHF0,"It is finally happening, the complete series to be released on DVD. After so long a wait, we finally can (pre) order this complete set.
Nash Bridges is one of my all time favorite tv series, really love the dynamic between Don Johnson & Cheech and the rest of the cast.
My personal favorite season is probably the third season but every season is a joy to watch. I can't wait till release date but according to TvshowsOndvd.com the release date probably will be pushed back to early 2015. I was lucky enough to pre-order it at only $69.99, so for this price I am willing to wait a few months.",1411257600,10,592,4.342342342342342

6649467,1,B00NGAJHF0,First disc skipped and pixelated within minutes of putting it into the player.

It is so nice to watch without the gore, the language, etc.  It is fantastic!  How come they don't make shows like this anymore??",1527811200,,299,4.267857142857143

6649496,4,B00NGAJHF0,This is a great series but the last three seasons the chapter skip is not right after the credits a little aggravating when you chapter skip. I wish they would bring this one back. The series they're bringing back are ten times worse than this one .This show is hilarious with Cheech and Don has cool charisma. Its a great show,1519603200,,327,4.377049180327869

6649499,5,B00NGAJHF0,"I love curling up at night to a few episodes.  I really liked the one that had Phillip Michael Thomas team up with Don Johnson again.  The episodes that Paul Michael Glaser directed were really good. (You remember him, Dave Starsky from Starsky and Hutch).
There really wasn't anything I disliked.",1519171200,,297,4.803921568627451

6649502,5,B00NGAJHF0,Nash and his family values,1517270400,,26,4.4
6649503,2,B00NGAJHF0,"Decent series.  However, item arrived with two of the six DVD cases badly damaged (very poor packaging).  Worse, every third episode of almost every disk hung up /stalled with no way to avoid/skip the bad sector (the track positioning feature was unavailable on these disks). Result, episode was unwatchable.  The same hangup problem occurred on two other DVD players, so the fault lies with the manufacturer, VEI.",1517097600,,414,5.149253731343284
6649504,5,B00NGAJHF0,"Finally a remastered version of this series. I have refrained from ordering this VEI product in the past because of dismal reviews that VEI has had over the years, in producing faulty dvd's like this. Based on the positive reviews of most recent, it appeared that VEI finally got the message and released a dvd set that was generally free of defects/flaws in the transfer process from the master.

So far, my wife and I have watched 6 discs involving the first two seasons, without a glitch. Obviously not as high a quality of image as a BluRay, but absolutely as good as you saw on in quality of image on televisions in the late 90's when this series started its 6 seasons. It is not grainy or faded at all. I would give the image quality an 8 in relation to new movie releases on standard dvd's. The only anomaly that we noticed is that the DVD's have been mastered to fit wider screen formats than were most prevalent back then , so they stretched the picture slightly, horizontally to fill today's flat screens. It is not overly done, but the characters exhibit a slight shortening and Nash's '71 Cuda is a bit wider on screen. Although noticed it does not detract from why we wanted a decent copy of the series...the fantastic entertainment in the story lines. And we are watching this with my 144"" high def, 3D Epson projector, which is a mind blower, quality-wise. So on smaller screens the resolution will be even better than what we are witnessing is being about as good as being in the movie theater with our projection system. Don't hesitate to buy this series based on image quality. It is very good and consistent.

The reason we love watching this captivating series is because Don and Cheech interact with a great cast of characters. We especially love the sidebar stories to crime fighting, which included many family interactions. This is some of Don's best work and far superior to the cold stereotype which he played in Miami Vice. His character, Nash, allows him to show an incredibly full range of personality behaviours all the way from tough cop to sensitive family man. He will suck you in with abandon, putting a smile on your face frequently. And the stories do not grow old or stale from one to the other. Each crime is cleverly different in its characteristics and each crime is generally solved within the episode. However, what endears one to the series is the on-going family story line, which ties it all together. Another great attribute of this series is superior script writing, with a LOT of humor thrown in and often delivered by Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong fame). Once we started watching this dvd set, it is hard to break away to even watch new movie offerings, etc, because this is so damned entertaining, We look at each other every night asking ""Do you wanna watch so and so?"" And instant mutual answer is ""Nah, lets watch Nash"". I am sure you will too, once you get started.

Oh, and one last thing. No cursing necessary or needed to deliver all the punch it needs, which is hard to find in visual entertainment today. We are not prudes by any stretch of the imagination, but writers today seem incapable of making a point about anything without the ""F"" word and various others which prove that they have a poor command of the english language.",1516752000,4,3293,4.587436332767402

6649506,5,B00NGAJHF0,"Great show,  If you are a fan of Don Johnson, this is a great post-Miami Vice series.  It ran five season, just like Miami Vice did, however shows are not related, at all.  This series also stars Cheech Marin (Cheech & Chong), who play a great part.",1516147200,5,249,4.25531914893617
6649507,2,B00NGAJHF0,"I love having all the episodes, and being able to watch all the seasons for the first time since syndication. Like the separate DVD seasons, the added expense was not spent to secure the licensing for the original music which can definitely be noticed. Other than being playable by a blue ray player these episodes do not appear to have ANY video enhancing. A series release on blue ray like Knight Rider (filmed in 82-86) looks substantially better. The clarity is just not there. Im surprised it was presented in 4:3 instead of 16:9 although I don't know what cameras were originally used for filming.",1516060800,,603,4.752380952380952

6649510,3,B00NGAJHF0,"Purchased the entire series as a holiday gift for my parents. So far, weve had one disc locking up every couple of minutes. The case didn't show the Blue sticker mentioned in earlier reviews, so I suppose a call to VEI is in order. Will be updating the review once we hear back from VEI.",1514332800,2,287,4.236363636363636

This issue has no subtitle or captions at all.  It should be mandatory that any discs should contain either subtitles or closed captions.  If not, it should be prominently stated in the product description that they do not.

6649553,5,B00NGAJHF0,classic and good to watch. I like being able to watch a program without having to watch every one before like you do now. Now if you miss one or two on tv you get lost because each program relies on a previous one to tell the story. Nash bridges can be watched out of sequence and they make sense although there are some underlying personal stuff that isn't important to the story line in most cases.,1490659200,5,400,4.207792207792208

I've enjoyed seeing Miami Vice and Nash Bridges after so so long and they still hold up today. There is just one thing I don't like about Nash Bridges... They stored the discs all in one storage unit. Like a book. Disc on top of discs. And I have really struggled to get the discs out. I'll have to use other cases,1487721600,10,441,4.080459770114943

6649573,4,B00NGAJHF0,"Review for the Blu-ray edition:

I received the Blu-rays and have been watching them.  I've watched to Season Three now.

I'm not sure if the problem is isolated just to this one disc and episode, but the last episode of Season Two on the third disc of Season Two, I think the episode was called Deliverance, cuts off at about 36 minutes into the movie and it defaults to the menu.  Hence, it never played to the end and when I scrolled through the episode it ends at 36 minutes, as there is nothing else past that point.

Has anyone experienced the same problem?  Also, has anyone owning the Blu-ray versions noticed  a bleeding of ghosting of the edges during scenes with action or when the camera goes from a still shot to a pan of the scene?

Otherwise, at least the early seasons have great sound, and color other than the above mentioned issues.  A well written action series with humor and interesting plots!

Best & thanks!",1486339200,,931,4.488095238095238

6649599,3,B00NGAJHF0,"If you ever saw the last years of this series on widescreen HDTV, you are going to be very disappointed at the picture quality of the release. It is terrible. Not only is it in 4:3, but the resolution is horrible. I've seen DVD's with better picture resolution taen this blu-ray set.
If you own it on DVD, don't bother to upgrade to blu-ray. If you don't own it, you will find the DVD cheaper without any loss of picture quality. It's too bad they did nothing to make the viewing experience better. The series is nice...the blu-ray's look isn't.",1481846400,4,545,4.46
6649600,1,B00NGAJHF0,"This Blu-ray release is NOT true HD, it is an upscaled SD transfer with lossy Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. While the video is a slight upgrade over the recent VEI DVD release, it is absolutely not Blu-ray worthy. It still suffers from fuzziness, rainbow artifacts, and pixelization. Black levels and compression are slightly better than they are on the DVDs, despite the Blu-rays having an average of EIGHT episodes per disc. VEI tries to get around this by putting a disclaimer at the beginning of each disc that due to the age of the program the video quality may or may not be what you expect.  This series has been airing in HD reruns on TV for years in a great-looking HD master.  VEI was just too cheap to pay for the upgraded HD master from CBS and literally just slapped their SD transfers from the DVDs onto Blu-ray discs.  All of the original broadcast songs that were replaced with generic music on the DVDs are still the generic replacement songs on the Blu-ray set. Overall, it is worth an upgrade over the DVD set for the slight picture quality increase if you can manage to pay the equivalent price of the DVD set for the Blu-ray. Here's hoping CBS releases a REAL Blu-ray set eventually.",1480464000,5,1199,4.541666666666667

6649664,5,B00NGAJHF0,September 2015...I purposely waited two months before I wrote this review.  I had been patient when the set first came out hoping the DVD gods would realize their issues and correct them.  THEY DID!!!!  I have enjoyed going through all 6 seasons and not a single glitch anywhere.  Have to mention the video quality was also flawless!  So this is a win-win situation and I could be happier.  It is a big investment and I crossed my fingers it would bite me in the back side.  SCORE!!!  I guess waiting the year to purchase also gave me a much lower price tag as the issue price has come down over $30 as well.  Could not be happier.,1442448000,24,631,4.3247863247863245

6649671,5,B00NGAJHF0,I was hesitant to buy it because of the reviews I read of bad DVD's. I've been waiting for the complete series for a long time so finally bought it. I watched seasons 4-6 with no issues. They were fine.,1437868800,3,202,4.075
6649672,3,B00NGAJHF0,"I love this series because it is a great show.  It has action and adventure as well as a great deal of humor.  Don Johnson is not hard on the eyes either!  However, I do have a problem with the manufacturing of the DVDS and the seller I bought from called deep discounts because one DVD had a defect.  The DVD said it contained four or five episodes but in the middle of the second episode it cut off in the middle as if the original recording was cut.  I asked deep discounts if they would replace the one defective DVD because I did not want to box up the entire set and send it back but they would not because they said it is against their policy.  They said I had to send the entire set back for a refund not a replacement.  I hate that because it inconveniences me but what really ticks me off is that this has happened more than once with them.  This was the second bad experience with this particular company where I received a defective DVD.  I intended to avoid buying from them after this experience but I mistakenly purchased from them again and the same thing happened with a different DVD set.  I have told deep discounts about my experiences with them but they did not really respond except to apologize.  I realize that getting a defective DVD is inevitable because we do not live in a perfect world.  However, when the same type of thing keeps happening from the same company over and over and over again I feel there is something seriously wrong with that company and their merchandise.  I purchase quite a few DVD sets each month because I am a TV junkie and there is not much on TV these days that I enjoy watching. So, I have a lot of experience with purchasing DVDS from various sellers but this is the one seller where I repeatedly have the same type of problem. Now, I am waiting for the manufacturer to release Season 6 so I can replace the one defective DVD because I did not return the set. It would have been too much of a hassle!  I think deep discounts knew that and was counting on it.  Don't let this deter you from buying the set because it is a great show but beware of who you are buying from and what their policies are!",1437696000,9,2155,4.234718826405868

I watched this show when it was originally on CBS and then when it went into sindication on WGN and Universal HD I was even more happy I have watched these so much that when I watched Jackpot the Season 5 finale Part 2 was supposed to open with Cowboy and id did not do so and a couple of episodes on season 6 did not have the original either.

6649709,1,B00NGAJHF0,"Nash Bridges was a great TV show.  During the series 6 seasons it featured music of local, and many unsigned bands that offered a wonderful backdrop to the show's wonderful San Francisco flavor.  Often, these bands would be featured playing at a party or given some nice face time on the show.  It's what made the show special.  On these six disks, billed as ""The Complete Series""  non of that music appears, instead replaced by generic background music.  If a band actually played live on the original show they have been chopped and the episode edited as to not show them.  In one episode from the sixth and last year, Phil Lesh & Friends who played live at the Great American Music Hall to start the episode tilted ""Cat Fight"" were completely cut out.  The show featured a Deadhead cop who was there enjoying the music.  After that performance was chopped, Lesh is left speaking with Nash and it's totally out of context as to why he's even there. The reason for this ?  Because Rysher who produced the original series didn't want to clear the music for DVD so the viewer is left with choppy episodes some of which are entirely changed or shortened.  Lots of great music by Harvey Mandel, Merl Saunders, Vince Welnick, Neal Schoen,  Phil Lesh & Friends, and many others have been deleted from ""The Complete Series.""

It doesn't make sense to only do half of the series with closed captioning and the other half of it without closed captioning. I feel discriminated against, not only for myself but for every person who is deaf or hard of hearing. Deaf and hard of hearing people have the same rights to enjoy watching  television shows and movies like every normal hearing people do. CBS/VEI decided to go the cheaper way to finish the series to make  money. I don't understand why all dvd and bluray dics are not closed captioned or subtitled.  Maybe the government should make it illegal for companies who make dvd and bluray disc of movies and tv shows to discriminate against the deaf and hard of hearing. On one hand I'm happy to have the complete series of Nash Bridges on dvd, but on the other hand I feel cheated because only half of the series contains closed captioning.

I was in Germany when it came out and I only got to watch a show here and there.  I have enjoyed this series very much but I did have to skip the last two episodes on season five disc four because they paused every couple of seconds and were totally unplayable.

I received the set today eager to start reliving this great show and popped in the first disc of the final season to just catch a glimpse of a scene that I remember really thinking was cool. I was shocked that it doesn't start with Louchie Lou and Mitchie One's Dangerous. The final episode of this season uses Julie Miller's I Still Cry when two characters are at a grave of a loved one and it was also replaced with generic crap that takes away from the scene. I am so displeased. Wasted money right here because I would've rather not had the show at all than have to watch it this way. Booooo!

 Two stars because the show is one of my all time favorites and it deserves all five stars, but VEI has royally screwed over the fans and are laughing all the way to the bank.",1415491200,14,937,4.2

(VEI), the studio's online store has added a listing (see button link below) showing that Nash Bridges - The Complete Collection is coming to a 27-DVD set on November 18th.

low side of the middle of the road. I purchased the first 3 seasons like many of you and have waited patiently for the remaining seasons. I even tried to contact Don Johnson, but as expected, no answer. Whenever I see a collection advertised as this one WITHOUT a studio listed, I shy away from them.  I will not pay the ridiculous amount wanted when I purchased mine for about $26 each locally, when they first came out,  with  PARAMOUNT labels on the DVD's. With a little research, I found the studio as VEI located in Canada. Was it an oversite by Amazon not to show it?
  It makes me wonder why Paramount would produce the first 3 seasons, then sublet the next 3 out to an independent. Like The Equalizer. I have the first season by Paramount. The rest as a whole is from  VEI. WHY?
U.S. studios find it cheaper to sublet? Downsizing?
I have contacted Paramount and will see if they answer concerning NB coming from an independent studio.",1414195200,4,1030,4.338541666666667

8677980,2,B00NGAJHF0,"There are still sets out there with defective discs.  From what I have read, the replacement discs are on backorder.  This appears to be SD sources scaled up to 1080.  It does not look like the original 35mm or master print was used.  Stick with the DVD version.",1532217600,,262,4.395833333333333
