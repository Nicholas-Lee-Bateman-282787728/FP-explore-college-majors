6152613,4,B00H9TPKV4,"The fight between Fabricio Camoes and Jim Miller had a surprise ending. The guy lying on the ground won. He beat the guy who was standing with a fantastic jiu-jitsu arm-lock technique. Its too bad that it ended too quickly in bout 1.

The heavyweight fight between Josh Barnett and Travish Browne had a bloody and quick ending. The winner won after landing 3 ferocious elbow strikes onto the face of the other fighter. That guy ended up with a bloody face. Again, Its too bad that it ended too quickly in bout 1.

The fight between Chris Weidman and Anderson Silva had a shocking ending indeed. Chris was a little bit stronger and his techniques were better. However, nobody expected Anderson broke his leg after Chris checked his low kick. It was terrifying to see Andersons left feet wrap around Chriss leg and then it jerked backward.

Again, Its too bad that it ended too quickly. It ended approximately at 1 minutes 30 seconds in bout 2.

In short, this DVD is definitely worth watching.",1396828800,,992,4.619318181818182
6152614,5,B00H9TPKV4,"This was such a bizarre pay-per-view. What happened to anderson silva was funny, but really gross. I read an article on mmajunkie and they said imagine a sock flapping in the wind. I like a bloody fight, but that description was graphic. Overall was awesome event, and a must buy.",1389225600,,280,4.62
6152615,4,B00H9TPKV4,"Let me say right off the bat that the score of this event would be an easy 5 star rating if it weren't for the way the main event ended, so if you see the rating change between 4 and 5 don't be surprised.  Officially the main card is the easy sell here as many of the prelims aren't that spectacular.  Some of the finishes are rather good (although one doctor stoppage came as a real surprise) but most of the fights would fall into the category of 3/5, possibly viewing but little replay value.  In terms of the main card, think of this as the equivalent of last year's UFC 146 event.  By that, I mean a lot of quick and brutal finishes in the main card with the co-main event and the main event as the only one's without first round finishes.

Dustin Poireir fights in the opening main card bout against Diego Brandao.  Dustin Poireir may be best known for his ""fight of the year"" candidate against Chan Sung Jung last year but is largely recognized by the fight community as a very good ground fighter with a strong record in the UFC given his young age.  Diego Brandao won The Ultimate Fighter during the Bisping/Miller season and has since enjoyed a rather successful run at featherweight in the UFC.  This fight initially had some bad energy going in as Brandao missed weight (considerably) which had angered Poireir.  The fight itself is largely a striking affair between two differing styles.  With one fight being the more technical striker the other relied heavily on his powerful hands but it meshed pretty well with the finish not coming until very late in the first round.

Jim Miller has been in the top ranks of the lightweight division for years and has a large fanbase due to his exciting bouts and large number of spectacular submission victories.  His opponent, Fabrcio Cames, is less well known with a more even record in his UFC career.  Largely known for his ground game Cames vs. Miller was an exciting bout on paper for me because I've always been a fan of a good ground fight but that is not a common fight in the UFC.  Now the fight is rather twofold actually as there's quite a bit that happens on the feet and ground.  The finish is amazing but one thing that bugs me is that the camera angle that happened during the live airing causes you to miss what is actually happening.  This is one of those cases where I hope the UFC brass opts to change the camera angle in post production for the DVD.

Personally, I had a bet that this would be the main card bout to end the quickest and as it turns out I was correct.  Josh Barnett is a former UFC heavyweight champion during his earlier run with the company and has always been considered one of the best heavyweights in the world since fighting in other corporations.  He returned to the UFC earlier in the year blitzing Frank Mir with a knee and was looking to get another victory notched under his belt on his way to a title shot.  Travis Browne, Barnett's opponent, has been with the UFC for 3 years now and has amassed an amazing portfolio of finishes along his strong track record.  In fact, after soundly beating Alistair Overeem in his last bout he's looking more and more like a strong future contender.  Now the fight ends pretty quickly with most of the action happening right before the finish.  Funny thing was that the replay for the end caught almost the entire second half of the fight, so that should give you a clue as to how quick this fight goes.  The finish itself is absolutely brutal and sends a real message to the rest of the division.

The co-main event to me is fight of the night, along with a ""fight of the year"" candidate.  It serves as a truly great mixture of elements.  First, Ronda Rousey and Miesha Tate are rematching one another from the Strikeforce bout that originally earned Rousey her current title run as the face of women's MMA.  Rematches can be good and bad but think of this as more likened to Matt Hughes/Frank Trigg II where it wasn't the fight people were keeping their eye on but it was the fight that left the biggest impression as the night ended.  Secondly, this was personal.  After completing a stint on The Ultimate Fighter as opposing coaches the rivalry only grew.  The bad blood between these two fighters has been well documented and while it has added fuel to the fire in the recent year the talk has been less than entertaining.  Personally, I don't think Tate came across all that well during her TUF stint and while Rousey let her feelings get the best of her I am shocked at the sheer amount of bad press she gets.  Again, just my personal thoughts though.  The fight itself is what I would bill as epic.  Not only was it gritty and high paced but the crowd was more than into it.  Simply put, the energy of this fight is amazing.  I definitely see this fight pushing women's MMA to another level.

Chris Weidman's rematch with Anderson Silva is going to leave a lot of questions.  Funny thing was the first fight left a lot of questions too but this bout will be talked about for different reasons.  As far as headlining bouts go the energy for this match was pretty incredible which really makes the ending seem that much more tragic.  Most people reading this will know how the fight ended but I'd recommend that if you're squeamish on any level to approach the finish of this fight very cautiously.  It's pretty brutal and it was a smart move to limit the number of replays to 2 during the actual event.  As far as I can guess they may keep it that way for the DVD or remove it entirely.  One comment about the winner though is the amazing first round performance he displayed and it leaves a large warning for future challengers.

Overall, a fantastic main card highlighted by quick finishes and an amazing women's fight.  Unfortunately, going forward many fans will only remember the tragic ending of the main event.  To me, I would say the event is worth buying but the one fight I urge fans to see is one of the few good fights on the whole card so if you're into good fights rather than quick finishes you may be disappointed.",1388188800,6,6075,4.436429215509468

8631283,5,B00H9TPKV4,"My principle interest was the Rousey-Tate contest, but all the fights presented on the UFC168 dvd were entertaining.

As usual, Rousey put on a spectacular show against her No. 1 nemesis Meisha Tate.  In my opinion, Tate paid for her divisive and derogatory comments and behavior prior to this meeting.  Tate should have realized that while she was successful in embarrassing and belittling Rousey, that embarrassment would simmer in Rousey and then really anger her.  When they met for the 2nd time here in UFC168, Rousey administered a real whipping.

After the decision,Tate tried to recover face by playing to the crowd  but Rousey just walked away.  Good for her.",1446249600,,668,5.0181818181818185
