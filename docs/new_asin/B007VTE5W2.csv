5111657,5,B007VTE5W2,"Has the usual breakdowns for burlesque but still a lot of fun. The teasing section is broken down and the toning is surprisingly tough. A lot of fun. I figure it could really help get the basics, help develop some grace for the stage as well as pin up photography.",1373673600,10,264,4.3
5111658,5,B007VTE5W2,"So, I confess. I am middle-aged (by which I mean old as dirt) and I am fat (by which I mean Seriously Fat)but I love love love this DVD! This DVD is divided in 4 parts: The steps, tease, tone and stretch. The tease portion is the one I do regularly because it is fun and sexy (at least when Ms. L'Amour does it) and it is about 25 to 30 minutes long. It is dancing burlesque style (grinds, shimmies etc). The toning part is tough (remember I am old and fat) lots of tricep work and lower abdomen work and it is groan inducing but you are rewarded with stretching.  Ms. L'Amour is very pretty and has the nicest voice. ( i know that sounds odd but she really has a lovely voice that is so pleasant to listen to...) She has a beautiful figure, naturally, and so is inspirational and aspirational! It is my sincere hope she does another DVD!!! [Just a note about the reviewer who gave this video 1 star because the wrong video arrived. Why oh Why do people do that? That should go on the sellers page not on a product review. It brings down the rating of the product but your review had nothing to do with the product. It is not fair to Ms. L'Amour or for that matter, any other author, dancer, poet, actor etc who is not to blame because you didn't get the right video or book or movie or whatever.  Ok, rant over. sorry.] 2 thumbs up for this DVD.",1368835200,43,1346,4.133587786259542

8522304,5,B007VTE5W2,"I love this DVD!  It's fun, and you can be sexy, silly, playful....whatever you want.  There are quite a few moves to learn, and the first few times through the tease part were frustrating to me because there is a choreography to learn.  My advice to those of you who are less than graceful (like me!) is to concentrate on getting the footwork and bump/grind work down before trying to incorporate the upper body very much.

I am so glad to finally have found a burlesque DVD with an instructor who can actually instruct.  Michelle knows how to mirror the viewer which makes it 100 times easier for most people to learn because you are moving the same direction as she is.  I only caught her slipping up once saying to go left instead of right, but by then I was already in the groove so it didn't mess me up.  As someone who has to see the same thing they are hearing in order to reproduce the step, I wish I had ordered this DVD first because I wasted a lot of time and money on instructors who say ""walk left"" and they walk to THEIR left (my right) and I get totally tripped up and frustrated.  This DVD was a totally refreshing change and one that won't end up in the giveaway pile!

Michelle's cues are pretty good, most of the time she reminds you of where you need to go before you need to make the move, and she is good at giving reminders from time to time.  She also appears to actually enjoy what she's doing.  The more I use this DVD the more I enjoy her personality and the time just flies by.  For some reason she makes even me feel sexy, and I try to mimic some of her mannerisms for fun.

This DVD is best, I think, for the beginner/intermediate exerciser/dancer.  I think for someone who is advanced it might be too repetitive, and probably not enough of a workout unless you're looking for something to do on an ""easy"" day.",1446076800,2,1841,4.252873563218391

8522309,5,B007VTE5W2,"I can't wait to try this! I am watching it through to see her instruction, and it's quite good. She's very fun and relaxed and you can't help but enjoy it compared to so many work out dvds where instructors are stuffy or inauthentic. The tutorial section explains and breaks down every move and then she has you practice it before moving on to the next. You don't feel rushed at all, and everything looks challenging but a lot of fun and isn't that the whole point? I am eager to get started and combine this with belly dancing to get into great shape with the fabulous Michelle L'Amour!",1406937600,,587,4.394495412844036
