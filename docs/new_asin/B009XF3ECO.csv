8544948,4,B009XF3ECO,"This is pretty much exactly what I wanted; a long leisurely ride through a scenic area.  The pace feels about right on my bicycle.  I like the fact that traffic is sparse to non-existent.  It's just you and your bike out there.

I can't comment on the music, except to say that I immediately put on my own tunes.

A minor complaint:  I wish the camera was mounted on a swivel, so there could be a more natural side to side sweep of the view, instead of breaking the flow with side views suddenly edited in.  The camera is obviously mounted inside a car (occasionally there is a line of glare from a windshield) so I understand why they can't sweep the camera.  Still, maybe the camera could be mounted on the roof, or the hood?",1453334400,,727,4.294117647058823
8544949,5,B009XF3ECO,"Spectacular scenery, very interesting and exciting around every curve!  I use this dvd when I want to climb and use tension on my indoor cycle!  Makes for a good workout.  I recommend this BOV dvd!  :-)",1405900800,,202,4.527777777777778
8544950,5,B009XF3ECO,Many of the videos are of flat roads that are not very challenging and less interesting. This is a hill climb which works you hard for most of the ride. The scenery is great too.,1367798400,,178,4.114285714285714
