6243360,5,B00HYJRKDA,Great movie!,1434499200,,12,5.5
6243361,4,B00HYJRKDA,"""Yves Saint Laurent"" (2014 release from France; 105 min.) brings the story of one of the biggest names ever in the fashion design industry, YSL. As the movie opens, we are in 1957, where we see young Yves with his family in Oran, Algeria (not long before the revolutionary war breaks out). During the opening titles, we jump to today, where YSL's partner explains why he is selling all of the art they had collected over the last 4+ decades. We then jump back to the late 50s, and it's not long before the crazily-talented YSL is off to Paris, where he works under that other monument of the French fashion industry, Christian Dior. When Dior unexpectedly passes away, YSL becomes the head designer (he was barely 22!). Meanwhile. we also get to know the personal life of YSL. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, there are dueling biopics on YSL currently out there. Besides this movie, there is also the similarly titled ""Saint Laurent"", also from France, so be careful to be sure that you don't mistakenly confuse one with the other. Second, this movie tries to give us both a look at YSL's professional life and his personal life, but in the end really doesn't do either one justice. It all seems very hurried (the movie covers 1957 through 1976), and as a result the movie lacks depth and drama. That is really a shame as there are some good moments in it. One of those is when YSL is under observation at a military hospital, and YSL's partner tells him: ""Do you want to live or do you want to die?"" Another good moment comes much later when the same partner observes ""You are happy only twice a year: in Spring and in Fall, when the collections come out"". I wish there were more such key observations. The two lead actors, Pierre Niney as YSL and Guillaume Gallienne as his partner, give their all in performances covering 2 decades, and it's certainly not their fault that the movie, while promising at times, ultimately falls short. Last but not least, tip o' the old hat to the production design of the movie, with the immaculate reproductions of Paris in the 60s and 70s (check out the old cars!).

""Yves Saint Laurent"" opened without any pre-release hype or advertising last summer (July, 2014) at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I figure it wouldn't be playing long so I went to see it right away (I was right, as it disappeared after only 1 week). The early evening screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended, The other YSL biopic I mentioned earlier is finally opening this weekend, and I'm looking forward to check that out, just to see how different it is from this one. Meanwhile, well-intended as it is but flawed, I still might suggest you check out ""Yves Saint Laurent"" when it is released on DVD/Blu-ray. If on the other hand you are a fashion aficionado, then this movie is a must-see!",1434067200,4,2943,4.571969696969697
6243362,4,B00HYJRKDA,Bertrand Bonello's SAINT LAURENT is much better overall. However in this one the actor portraying YSL does a good job,1433980800,,117,4.9
6243363,4,B00HYJRKDA,Very good movie. Detailed YSL's life in an accurate and informative light.,1433721600,,74,5.25
6243364,5,B00HYJRKDA,Love this film with all its drama and excitement!,1432166400,,49,4.555555555555555
6243365,3,B00HYJRKDA,"YVES SAINT-LAURENT traces the career of the eponymous fashion designer (Pierre Niney) from his early days in the late Fifties to the zenith of his fame two decades later.  The film concentrates on his professional as well as his personal struggles with long-time lover (and manager) Pierre Berg (Guillaume Gallienne).

Director Jalil Lespert makes a lot out of Saint-Laurent's background as an outsider; born in Algeria during the colonial period, he never really felt at home in mainstream Parisian society.  He began his career by following existing fashion patterns; but after being dismissed as ""boring,"" immediately after leaving the house of Dior (Patrice Thibaud) he branched out on his own.  This proved a wise move, as the film shows how he shot to stardom with a series of daring and often innovatory designs.  There are several shots of Saint-Laurent working on his new creations day and night, to the despair of Pierre.

YVES SAINT-LAURENT offers a sumptuous recreation of Fifties and Sixties Parisian society.  Deliberately shot in washed-out colors, the film conjures up a lost world of large saloon cars, packed streets and never-ending parties where Saint-Laurent spent most of his leisure-time.  The models' hairstyles are deliberately ostentatious, especially that of principal mannequin Victoire (Charlotte Le Bon) who at first attracts and then repels Saint-Laurent.

Lespert's film doesn't tell us much about Saint-Laurent's life, other than the fact that he was something of a tortured genius, always on the lookout for personal as well as professional satisfaction but never seeming to find it.  He enjoys a close relationship with his mother (Marianne Basler), and later on in life he always runs back to Pierre for emotional as well as professional support.  With his black horn-rimmed lenses and increasingly disheveled hair-styles, Niney gives a convincing portrayal of the designed.  On the other hand, perhaps the script should have offered more insight into how Saint-Laurent became such an iconic figure of the fashion world; what was it about him that made him so popular with both high society and the ordinary consumer.

As Pierre, Galienne has to make the best of a supporting role, and succeeds brilliantly.  He comes across as a patient person, ever ready to forgive Saint-Laurent's excesses; but nonetheless dedicated to the fledgling fashion-house's future success.  In several backstage sequences he is shown managing the models, designers and other assorted hangers-on with quiet efficiency, clipboard in hand.  It was mostly down to his efforts that the house of Saint-Laurent enjoyed its global success; without him, the designer might have only had limited appeal.

YVES SAINT-LAURENT is definitely watchable - some of the party-scenes where the hero enters a drug-filled world of fantasy and hallucination - are particularly memorably shot.  But I still think the film represents something of a missed opportunity to dramatize the life of an icon.",1412726400,2,2992,5.343283582089552
6243366,5,B00HYJRKDA,"Perfect! If you love Yves Saint Laurent, you will love this movie. This movie is perfect. I bought the French version DVD without/ with no English subtitles. I do not speak French, but I did not want to wait for this film to come out in America/ USA. I loved every moment of this film. This film is so beautiful. Yves Saint Laurent (2014) is just the right length, not to long, not to short. The cinematography/ lighting is amazing. The acting is perfection. The casting is terrific. This film made me cry. Yves Saint Laurent was the greatest/ best fashion designer/ dressmaker/ couturier of all time. Shows some of the most important moments in his extraordinary life and his beautiful homes. Yves Saint Laurent (2014) shows the importance of finding your true love/ soul mate in your life, no matter what. One of the most beautiful heart felt love stories I have ever see. Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge have a love that is to be envied and admired and aspired to.",1410220800,10,971,4.586206896551724
6243367,5,B00HYJRKDA,"Wonderful movie! The performances are amazing... the lead actor IS Yves Saint Laurent! The cinematography is gorgeous, costumes (the YSL dresses are authentic) are amazing, art direction beautiful. It is VERY FRENCH, so don't expect a victorian morality tale. Still, the movie says a lot by implying and leaving things up to the imagination... something I wish more American films would do. If you like YSL, you MUST get this film. A lot of the details on YSL's life were left out, but I think it was smart to make a movie about the story of his life more than a ""biography.""",1410048000,,575,4.647058823529412

There were few scenes that I had to turn my head since after all not my gig at all but the whole acting was excellent. I did not get the fashion world as I have seen in other designer DVDs but I certainly got to see great acting. By the way, YSL himself was not in this DVD so this is only a movie, and somehow heavy movie in French.",1457568000,2,474,4.0

6243381,4,B00HYJRKDA,"I've seen both versions of the YSL story and I liked this one much better.  The clothes are the real thing, there was less sensationalism regarding his love life and the actor who portrayed Saint Laurent made you fall in love with him.  He captured the shyness and insecurity of Saint Laurent in a way the actor in the other film did not.  If anything, I wish the movie were longer as there was much more of the story to tell, but I'll settle for what was given.  Worth seeing!",1448064000,3,477,4.266666666666667

I recently watched the other Bio-Pic from 2014 entitled Saint Laurent, thinking it would give more insight, however, I much preferred Yves Saint Laurent with Pierre Niney as YSL. In addition, the relationships with the actors Pierre Niney, Guillaume Gallienne and Charlotte Le Bon were better portrayed in this film.",1443830400,,384,5.015625
6243387,3,B00HYJRKDA,I was hoping for more fashion and fewer sexual acts among homosexuals.  I guess it was an honest biography of a prodigious talent.  His suffering beatings in a Catholic school at the hands of his peers is very sad.  His later suffering manic-depression is also sad.  His partner is really the person who saved his life and cleared the way for him to be his most creative.  It is astonishing that Yves lived to be 71 given his years of hedonism.,1443225600,,444,4.432098765432099

The structure of the film builds to a powerful climax and the glamorous fashion show towards the end, with the gorgeous Maria Callas aria playing in the background is truly overwhelming.  One of the ignorant people on this site complained about Pierre Niney's nose.  I can assure you he was not wearing a ""fake nose"".  If the reviewer took the time to look at other photo's of the actor he would see his nose is the same as in the film.  This movie is beautifully photographed and produced.

It is a French film about an iconic and iconoclastic French designer in the decades of the 50's - 70's.
