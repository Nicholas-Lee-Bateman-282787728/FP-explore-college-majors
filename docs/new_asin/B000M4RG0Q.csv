2724025,5,B000M4RG0Q,"As you can see from the other reviews, there is little in the way of plot, like most video games.  Every couple of floors, there is a boss.  The fighting and bosses become more difficult as the player, ahem police officers, move up the building.
The difference here is the quality of action.  No video game can come close to the magnificent choreography in the fight scenes.  This is a pure adrenelin rush for the ""twitch crowd"".  Get jacked up on Dew, eat a bag of gummy-bears and hang on.  Not to be missed.",1339113600,,509,4.361702127659575
2724026,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I tend to be long-winded in my reviews, so I'll try to keep this one simple: this movie is great.

It's best to judge movies on what they aspire to. Some might watch this film and wish there were more complex characters, snappier dialogue, a more intriguing plot line. The rest of you will be spending most of your time with your mouth open in awe.

This film wants to be only one thing: an example of high-octane, perfectly choreographed mayhem and violence. In the first five minutes, the audience is treated to a tongue-in-cheek dose of highly concentrated exposition as one of the main characters explains the plot to his brothers-in-arms. A van full of heavily armed police officers have been tasked with invading an apartment building that is wired, protected, and run by a notorious gang leader. The building is filled with criminals, deviants, and various other lowlifes who, with machine guns and machetes in hand, will stop at nothing to bring down the invading presence of the law. Will the cops make it to the top and bag the End Boss? Or will they find themselves painting the walls by the day's end?

There are a few requisite twists in the story, but they are nothing compared to the number of spins and moves made by both the camera work and the martial artists that flip and flurry through each scene. The technical prowess of the movie is astonishing, especially considering its relatively small budget, and I more than once found myself wondering how many people were actually harmed during the making of the film. I know that special effects these days can do incredible things, but a movie like this makes you wonder if the effects are less special than the talented men they have doing their deadly dances up and down the halls and stairwells of this grim crime den.

It's always sad when a movie with high goals doesn't have the steam to reach them. It's also disappointing when a movie sets low goals and meanders toward them apathetically. This film sets the bar for action films, and then it spirals and pirouettes all over the bar like an expert gymnast. If you like action movies at all, if you don't mind dialogue and plotting taking a backseat to visuals, and if you are a fan of the artistry of the human body in motion, bring a bag of popcorn and a lust for blood, and this movie will not let you down.",1339113600,,2334,4.563245823389021
2724027,5,B000M4RG0Q,"If you are an action movie fan, then this is a movie you must see.  The story is very simple and to the point, wasting very little screen time covering what you need to know.  There is a SWAT team that has volunteered to raid a slum that is housing one of the city's most ruthless crime lords, along with all of the thugs he allows to reside in the building.  That's really all you need to know, and the movie moves along from there.

The fighting is brutal and well-shot, opting out of the standard shaky-cam style used in more modern action movies, instead giving you a clear picture of exactly what is happening on the screen at all times.  As things escalate further in to the movie, things get move visceral and intense.  When I left the theater I was actually sore from how tense my body was during the majority of it's runtime.

I've never written a review here before, but this movie has absolutely encouraged me to do so.  If you're looking for a complex story with a lot of twists and turns, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  If you're looking for a movie with a solid, straight forward story that has more action and hand-to-hand combat than you would believe, then this is definitely a movie you need to watch.

Highly recommended.",1338854400,3,1246,4.4493392070484585

2724106,3,B000M4RG0Q,"Let me start off by saying that the action scenes in this movie are great!  T.

However, the sound on this movie--or at least the Amazon Prime stream--is horrendous to the point that it made watching this movie unenjoyable.  I have built a pretty high end 7.1 system with reputable equipment from brands like Marantz, SVS, etc. - I have also taken a significant amount of time to tune the system to bring out its potential.  I'm not one of those audiophiles that can hear the difference between a generic cable and a Monster-brand cable - but I also know what sounds good and what does not.

The surround mix on this movie was horrible - perhaps one of the worst I have ever heard.  The levels in this movie are all over the place - One moment, you could barely hear Iko Uwais speaking out of the center channel and suddenly a surround channel would erupt with the sound of a fist hitting a chest at maximum volume.  The bass was boomy and out of control.  It almost sounds like someone took various ""sound clips"" and crudely pasted them together without actually mixing the end results - it was bizarre and extremely distracting as I constantly adjusted the volume from 50% to 90%.  I stopped and restarted the stream several times to confirm that it was not my FireTV - the results were the same.

I have never had this sort of level imbalance happen on any other Prime stream.  Have any other users noticed this?",1508716800,,1415,4.466926070038911

The plot, the twists, the characters, the setting, the choreography, the cinematography, the gore, the amazing quotes, the original language conveying so much emotion beyond English... this movie is flawless to me. All the big American studios need to take note. An absolute masterpiece on all levels. And just as good as what it contained was what it didn't. No sappy love story or romantic scenes (just the raw emotion of the main character knowing he has a child on the way), no b.s. predictable garbage ending, no cheesy lines, no cliche moral nugget, etc, etc....

Incredible acting from the main characters, down to every last extra. Mad Dog lived up to his nickname in such a bone-chilling manner! This movie is EPIC. I have nothing else to say...",1500940800,,861,4.6644736842105265

So, that part royally sucked, but other than that mess up it was a decent story line with multiple pretty good action sequences.

They combined some eastern elements, but definitely fused those in with the western ones to create an extremely unique franchise and one of the best, if not the best, pure martial arts film out right now.

2724292,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Wow. What a film! As a fan of martial arts movies, I've had this on my radar for a while. It exceeded my expectations, but there's honestly not much to say. The set up is simple and classic, it's literally cops versus robbers. A SWAT Team is sent on the titular raid inside a high rise run by a notorious gangster. It doesn't take long before hell breaks loose and both sides are locked into one brutal scene of  literally escalating action after another.

Be warned: this is quite possibly the most violent movie that I have ever seen. It certainly fits the story and the action is some of the best edited and choreographed, but man, be prepared for pure unadulterated VIOLENCE.

It's also worth noting that this movie is Indonesian, and it was interesting to see a less represented East Asian culture in a big budget martial arts movie. However, it clearly has a lot of Western influences as well, more than most East Asian martial arts movies that I'm familiar with.

All in all, I'd recommend this to any fan of martial arts movies, just beware, as it is not for the faint of heart.",1474848000,4,1086,4.46969696969697

2724407,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I'm an action movie junkie, easily one of the best action movies to come out in the last 20 years. The fact they did this on a 1 million dollar budget makes this movie even more impressive. Some of the death scenes are just imaginative and amazing, do yourself a favor and watch this and then the sequel Raid 2 if you haven't already, these 2 movies will literally blow your mind with how well done they are. Just showed this to my roommate who isn't a fan of movies with subtitles or Kung fu movies, and he absolutely loved it.

If you're at home because you called in sick to work, or you run into bad weather on a weekend, just stay in and watch this and Raid 2 back to back, you won't be disappointed.

Also would recommend Dredd (not your Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd) if you enjoy this movie, similar premise and they came out around the same time, I prefer Raid, but both are pretty awesome.",1460419200,7,902,4.3

2724515,5,B000M4RG0Q,"First there was Merantau.  And apparently it was good  [I didn't see it].  Good enough that it inspired several sequels, like ""The Raid: Redemption"", and ""The Raid 2"" [which I haven't yet seen].

Or should I say first there was Bruce Lee, and ever since the rest of the world has been trying to catch up with him?  For a martial arts film that transcends its genre, it is very hard to beat Bruce Lees Enter The Dragon.  However--this film is a powerful combination.  Who would expect a Welsh director to become a major name in martial arts movies?  [Gareth Evans].  Who ever heard of silat before?  [Well, I hadnt, but it is the main style used in the fights, although not the only one.]  Who ever heard of Iko Uwais [thats the good guy in these films]?  Or Yayan Ruhian?  [Hes one of the bad guys here, but hes also the real master of silat, and the fight choreographer].

Since Gareth has sort of settled in Indonesia, Im kinda guessing silat is an Indonesian martial art and most of the actors and actresses are Indonesian.
Yes, there is a plot.  No, its not very complicated.  Yes, there is a helluva lot of fighting.  No, its not non-stop fighting for 90 minutes.  There are pauses, and there are conversations.  But- a lot of fighting.  Some of the fight scenes are 5 or 6 minutes of continuous action, involving as many as 18 combatants before they're through.

No, theres no artificial convention, like in Enter the Dragon that no guns are allowed on the island.  There are plenty of guns here.  However sometimes guns run out of ammunition.  Or sometimes, if you're bum-rushed from the side, you may never have time to use it.  There are also plenty of knives, machetes, and everything else used as a weapon.  Just like in real life.  To paraphrase one of Bruce Lees students: Real life fights are not like martial arts tournaments.  There are no rules.  There are no referees.  Theres blood and sweat, and rolling around on the floor, and just trying to survive by beating the other guy, any way you can.  This movie makes you feel like that is exactly what you are watching.  And the action is very impressive.  Probably the most impressive Ive seen since Enter The Dragon.  I guess I should add there is very little swearing, no nudity, and no gratuitous blood and gore--just awesome fight sequences.",1437177600,,2312,4.558536585365854

2724572,5,B000M4RG0Q,"One of the greatest fight choreography I have ever seen.  If you have a problem with violence or strong language, then do not watch this movie. The ""Great Shopper"" review on March 25th is the worst review ever. All you can say is it was to violent and they cursed to much. I do agree the plot is a little tough to put together if your attention span is less than two minutes, as it takes some thought to put it all together. So instead of claiming the movie is bad, maybe talk about how you are incapable of watching violent films. You purchased the sequel after watching the original just to sell it? That statement alone shows that you are not that bright. It only takes a second to read a description or watch a trailer to see if the movie fits your likes and that would not only save me from reading your review, but also keep you from watching a movie you don't like. It is one thing to say it's a bad movie with valid points, and another to say it's bad because You don't like excessive violence. All I learned is what kind of movies you don't like. That is like me saying brokeback mountain is a horrible movie because I don't like men kissing each other, or how Barney is stupid because I hate the color purple. That is more about me than the quality of the film.

2724586,1,B000M4RG0Q,"To say this movie is terrible, rotten, bad, distasteful, nasty, sickening would be a compliment.  This is the absolute sickest movie I have seen in years. First of all the movie is dubbed and it doesn't even come close to lining up. Second, it stinks.  Third, the F word has to be used at least a couple of hundred times. Fourth, it stinks big ones. Fifth if I ever hear from someone that american movies are violent, they have not seen this piece of trash. There is no plot. It starts bad and goes downhill from there. Oh, have I said...IT STINKS!!!!  Amazon we need something lower than one star...how about skunks with tails up and big noxious gas cloud?  Then I can say, I would give it 5 skunks.

I also bought Raid 2...after watching this piece of trash, I sent the second one in for a trade in. I never watched it but sadly had taken the wrapping off so instead of getting a refund, I may get 5-10% of the cost.

Iko Uwais in only his second film I feel did a wonderful job & I will be on the lookout for anything else he may be in.

2724924,5,B000M4RG0Q,"The premise for the raid is quite simple. A task force of swat team officers are performing a raid (hence the name) on a narcotics base run by a evil boss gangster. The base is actually an apartment complex housing some of the baddest baddies in town. Initially the police officers go in stealth and seem to face little resistance but one mistake blows their cover and the entire gangster facility is made aware of their unwanted house guests. Outnumbered, outgunned and trapped with no way out, our heroes find themselves in a desperate fight for their lives. Rama our protagonist is a likeable character and there is enough of a plot here to make you feel invested in the fights but not enough for the story to anything more than a basic framework. We're never really explained how Rama became a martial arts master. The only backstory we're given are through some brief dialogue and a few flashes of his pregnant wife.

Where The Raid shines is the Martial Arts. Typically this genre is dominated by Chinese Kung Fu. Think Jet Li, Jackie Chan. Bruce Lee, Donnie Yen. The Raid is unique in this regard because the actors and martial artists featured in this film are Indonesian. The setting is Jarkarta and while the official style of Martial Arts in Indonesia is Pencak Silat, we see much more than just one style here. Elements of Krav Maga, Eskrima, and Muay Thai are all present and it is brutal. Rama's enemies are out to kill hm. They come at him with machetes knives and guns. He doesn't just knock out his opponents. He disarms and then he stabs, bashes heads, and breaks bones. Sure some of it feels it bit cartoony but there are many moments that you get a real sense of combat and that is exactly what I love about this film. It's no holds barr combat fighting. You never feel like the characters are dancing. It's just a fresh take on a genre that has had a hard time breaking out of it's mold. If you love martial arts or martial arts films, this is a must see. If your not really into either of those, this may not be for you however I can't wait to watch the sequel next!!",1409097600,,2089,4.440104166666667

Not perfect, mind you, but close enough that I didn't spend half the movie groaning!
WARNING TO PROSPECTVE BUYERS/RENTERS:....This i NOT a movie for children or the weak of heart!  It contains VERY graphic scenes of extreme  violence, including  execution-style murders, bloody fight scenes, and other disturbiing events.  No spoilers here, but be forewarned.
The movie IS, however, one I would seriously recommend to anyone with the stomach to watch it, especially those interested in  non-PC or unsanitized  look at police problems on a global scale.  For this audience, a trule worthwhile experience!
A superb movie, with some warnings!",1406073600,2,942,5.472222222222222

The story is not as barebones as others say... and the movie is not NON STOP...  there are many non-action scenes that build up the characters and the story.  In other words.. you get to breathe between the awesome action scenes.

I will get the sequel and watch it.  Good direction that fits the storytelling.  Noticed lots of storytelling effects that enhanced the storytelling, in fact.  Very creative work.",1405814400,,556,4.860215053763441

The plot line is not elaborate, in fact, short of the protaganist joining a kung fu tournament, you couldn't ask for a simpler narrative.

This might imply that the movie is generic and unremarkable.  That couldn't be farther from the truth, otherwise I wouldn't say I loved it.  This is an action movie, yes, but it is an action movie that performed perfectly.  Excellent camera work, extremely creative choreographed fight scenes, and a boss fight that has been sufficiently set up to leave the end result in doubt.

I love this movie and I was willing to shell out the (considerable) cash to get a pre-order of the sequel on this film's merit alone.  Trust me, it's amazing.",1403481600,,836,4.601351351351352

2725020,5,B000M4RG0Q,"My husband and I just watched 'The Raid: Redemption' last night, and all I can say is......OoooWee!!

First off, please know that I am usually not a fan of sitting through action movies. They usually fall flat with me even when being completely over the top. And I certainly would never have thought myself to love, or even like, a martial arts-style fight movie. (Kick, kick, punch, punch, fly through the air.... boring!)

However, this movie blew me away.
It was so much fun and super entertaining!

Nearly every fight had both of our jaws hanging open. And I can't even remember how many times we each shouted ""How did they DO that?!?!""
The action is nearly non-stop, so the fights are plentiful.
One actually left me out of breath, it was so intense and action packed. (I have a feeling you will know the one, when/if you watch this film.)

My husband would kill me if he knew I put this in here, because it sounds so nerdy, but we actually high-fived each other after the movie.
I know.....but we really did!

The choreography is stunning. I felt it was much realer and ""grittier"", if I may say, than anything I have ever seen before.

This movie has a very simple plot, and is very bloody and very violent. Which we  just love!

""The Raid: Redemption"" is brutal. It's intense. It's exhausting. And it is so much fun!
I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is up to it.

We CANNOT wait until the sequel comes out next month!",1402444800,,1441,4.469465648854962
2725021,5,B000M4RG0Q,"In a martial arts based action movie, there are a few key aspects to look out for: fight choreography, camerawork, and editing. In all three of these areas, The Raid is a total success. The choreography of the action sequences is truly incredible. The actors themselves are obviously well-trained and their sparring has a stylized yet brutally organic quality to it that makes the fighting all the more engaging. Gareth Evans and his DP's capture the mayhem in a very active sort of way. The camera is always moving and never loses track of where it needs to be. Evans also did a superb job of cutting the film. If the viewer would try to count the number of shots in a single three-minute sparring scene, they would most likely lost track after a hundred. That's not to say the editing is overdone though, just well done. If one looks at The Raid from a narrative/structural standpoint, there's not much to be found. The family angle is a bit contrived, as is the crooked cop angle, but for a film like The Raid that is clearly not trying to break any new ground on the drama front, that's perfectly alright. It does, however, try to be an exceptional martial arts action movie and triumphs gloriously. Bring on the sequel!",1402358400,,1224,4.593607305936073

It is the single most high-energy and intense action flick I've ever seen. Everything looks like it hurts. It has hand-to-hand fighting on a the same level as a Tony Jaa flick (Ong Bak, The Protector), and weapon violence on the same level as the newest Rambo.

There's no way anyone could call The Raid boring. But what you might not expect from this movie is something that justifies all of it's action with the offset of the well paced dramatic scenes. And the fighting and action in this movie is so wonderfully coherant and fun to watch with reliably steady camerawork, that made me want to throw the book at the Jason Bourne School of Shaky Cam Intensity.
(although for the Jason Bourne series, the shaky cam mostly all works for me, not as much for the copycats that have tried to follow it).
The blu ray, the actual product now, is great too, with both dubbed and subtitled options for you viewing pleasure, with some good extras and commentaries from the director.",1400025600,3,754,4.551470588235294

I would have to agree that this movie is probably the most action-packed picture ever committed to film. From the moment the police force gets to the apartment building, about 6-8 minutes into the film, until the last man falls, it's 90 minutes of the most intense, pulse-pounding hand-to-hand combat and gun fights that you will ever see.

Things go well at first for the cops but their luck doesn't last. Their stealthy entrance is quickly discovered and the population is turned against them. Soon enough only a handful of cops are left in the building. The crime lord has two lieutenants (one smart and one thuggish) who are sent to clear out the remaining cops. The initial gun action quickly switches to brutal martial arts combat sequences with lots of knives and machetes.

And that's really the center of the movie--non-stop action designed to impress viewers. The switch from gun violence to hand-to-hand combat is a welcome change but the violence is fairly extreme and not particularly unique. Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee or Tony Jaa or Chuck Norris have their own styles and charisma that make their films enjoyable to watch. The main character here doesn't have their charisma, even though he's given a pregnant wife to come back to. Sure, he's a good fighter and someone to root for, but he isn't as compelling as other martial artists on screen. The fights become more impressive towards the end of the film.

For me, that's not enough to make the movie recommendable. It's technically impressive but emotionally cold. If you just want to see a lot of martial arts and violence, the movie delivers in spades. But I just didn't enjoy it like other similar films.",1399334400,,1698,4.7687074829931975

It also takes a while for the action to get going, but when it does...look out! Its easily got the best final action sequence of virtually any martial arts film of the last ten years as well.

The action scenes, while good, were infrequent and the setups were contrived.  The dialog, assuming the dubbing was even vaguely accurate, was awful.  Even the reason for being in the building seemed forced.

2725070,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I have always loved martial arts and other action packed movies that also have a good story behind it.  I had never heard of this movie (The Raid Redemption) when it first came out; however, after reading about the second one (The Raid-2) which just came out at the theaters, I decided to purchase this one.  Many times movies are over  hyped and wind up being not very good movies, but everything I had read about this DVD movie is true.  This is a foreign (made in Jakarta) film with subtitles but don't let that discourage you from seeing this DVD.  Those who love action movies are in for a real treat with this movie.

The theme is about an elite Police SWAT team who have been assigned to raid a protected safe house filled with criminals, including the big crime boss.  As they enter this high rise broken down looking building the raid seems to be going well, but in a very short time all hell breaks lose.  The  SWAT team members are quickly confronted by the criminals who are shooting, hacking and chopping to stop the SWAT team from getting to the crime boss as the SWAT team climbs to each floor.  The fight scenes includes incredible martial art battles using fists, feet, head, knives, machetes and of course a wide variety of guns and rifles.  After viewing this fantastic action movie I will definitely see the sequel which just came out.

If you love well made action movies that keep you riveted to your seat, this movie is for you.  I loved it and will no doubt view it again and again.

I loved the effects of Crouching Tiger and The Matrix when they came out, but now everyone uses them, and no fights look real anymore (which was the point in those two movies and has been forgotten by most martial arts movies today).

It has maybe the best martial arts fight choreography that I have ever seen.

The action sequence are very well done. The ones in the beginning are essentially gun fights while the later ones are all hand to hand combat after everyone runs out of ammunition.

Rama is part of a SWAT team in charge of getting down a drug lord. He doesn't know more and, at first, all looks like the usual good vs bad bad plot, until interesting and shocking revelations come out throughout the movie.

Gareth Evans directed the movie in Indonesia. Actors rehearsed the actions many times until the perfect shot was reached - often for 16 hours a day... The result is breathtaking. Do we have only action/fights in this movie? Quite a lot of action, yes. But the director was able to add his personal and subtle touch that make the difference with many other (poor) movies: characters are shown via an atmosphere, some remarkable directing approaches that keep us focus for the whole 1 hour and 41 minutes.
Keep an eye on Gareth Evans. He is a very promising director.

Indonesians actors are the perfect cast (most of them were not actors before the movie). Besides the charismatic Rama, they've all figured out a way to be unforgettable! The dark machete guy (who is an architect in real life), ""Mr Miyagi"" Mad Dog, the intriguing yet scary drug lord....

2725166,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I bought this Blu Ray on a whim after reading so many good reviews, and many people claiming it was similar to ""Dredd"", which I thoroughly enjoyed.  And those people are spot on.  The movie is great, and it does share more than a few similarities with Dredd (though I need to clarify that it's just a coincidence, as the movies were being made more or less at the same time and in different countries, neither is ripping off the other).

Now, I see a couple of naysayers here saying the movie doesn't have too much in the way of a plot, and it really looks like those people are expecting some Oscar-bait drama from an action movie, or maybe they think a movie needs a romance subplot in order to qualify as having a story.  While I won't say the story of the movie will move you or anything, is a really normal storyline for an action movie.  You'll find classic action movies like Rambo or Commando having no better stories than this one.  Plus, it's an indonesian film, you can't just expect them to have the same storytelling style than american movies.  It's not that it's a bad style, it's just different.

The plot of the movie involves a police team being summoned to stealth-raid a building, looking for a drug lord.  One of the members of the team is also using the raid as an excuse to bring back his brother, who lives there.  Unfortunately, the mission goes bad since almost the beginning, when the team is discovered, the building is put into lockdown by the drug lord and the raid turns into a fight for survival.

Now, here's one major difference between american and indonesian cinema: the latter prefer to show and not tell.  For instance, we're never explicitly told that the guy who the protagonist wants to rescue is his brother and one of the drug lord's henchmen, but there are several clues to it, some more obvious than others.  The use of visual instead of spoken language to reveal plot points is what leads some people to say this film has no story.  That's because those people are spoiled by Hollywoods oftentimes excessive exposition.  But I think what this film does is a good thing.  It spices things up, and film is a visual medium, it's more important to show than to tell.

The most appealing part of the movie, though, are the fights.  Main star Iko Uwais is rapidly ascending the ranks of martial arts movie stardom.  He's not the only character to get in a physical fight, but his ones are the best ones, particularly the knife fight in the middle of the film.  The stunts in this movie are very well done, to the point of being terrifyingly realistic (and if there's any CGI in it, it sure as hell fooled me, because I couldn't find it).

Oh, yes, this movie is quite violent.  If you tend to flinch at the sight of gore, this movie is not for you.  That being said, the gore is neither over-the-top nor gratuitious, it's realistic, chilling, and not the entire point of the film (a film by Eli Roth this is not).

So yes, this a very fun and exciting action film.  The Blu Ray has great quality, and it's packed with extras.  The one thing that I found interesting is that you can choose the soundtrack for the film.  Either the original one or a new one by Linkin Park.  This is a pretty cool feature, and I've never seen it on a movie before.  Each soundtrack might make the movie feel different, so it's nice to give it a try.

For spanish speakers, there's another interesting thing I've never seen on another movie before.  It includes both latin and castilian spanish audio tracks and subtitles.  Usually, there are two separate editions for it, it's nice to have them both in one.

But I need to say, the movie feels better with the original indonesian audio track and subtitles.  In any case, steer clear of the english audio track, you can tell by the very first few lines that it's terrible.",1389398400,,3842,4.457020057306591

They market this movie as being relentless and full of action and one of a kind when, in reality, it's just another s***ty movie that's hoping because they show a little more gore than american movies it will be regarded as ""brutal"" or ""intense"" or ""gritty"". This movie focuses entirely too much on a plot or story of whatever you want to call it, that just isn't there. The action, while sometimes entertaining, is broken up by extremely long periods of literally nothing. Then when there is action, it starts out great but is over way too soon. On multiple occasions I found myself wanting more action but there just wasn't any. For some reason, they thought an action movie required more focus on a overly derivative plot full of cliches and expectable ""twists"" than the freaking action.

This movie blew me away. I've seen it at least ten times and it still hasn't worn out its welcome. Iko Uwais is the real deal. The next Bruce Lee (how many times have you heard THAT before?). But it's true. I've never seen fighting like this. The Raid is low-down, dirty fighting. The choreography is just unreal. This is the anti-Crouching Tiger/Matrix.

2725189,5,B000M4RG0Q,"First things first, don't watch the ""Redemption"" aspect of this film. Just watch ""The Raid"". It's better without the inexplicably terrible new Linkin Park soundtrack and astonishingly comical dub.

The remix is in no way an improvement over the original soundtrack. I've nothing against LP, believe me, but the original soundtrack is simply more exciting and a lot more dramatic--I have no clue why they thought this poorly-done new soundtrack was warranted, because it makes the movie less exciting.

OK, we have that out of the way? Cool. Now, if you've done this properly, you'll be listening to the original audio with subtitles (I know they can be annoying and I don't like to have to read subtitles either if I can help it, but anything's better than this laughably bad dub that couldn't possibly have taken more than a single afternoon).

So, it goes like this:
The Raid: Redemption: One star. Seriously, with the dub and new soundtrack, you can't even take it as a dumb action flick. It's there, but with the new audio, it's just...No, just no.
The Raid (original): Five stars. Yes, it's that much better than the default settings on the disc.

Now let's review ""The Raid"" briefly, in a few pros and cons to keep it nice and brief.

Pros:
- Some of the best martial arts sequences you'll ever see, especially given the cool context (no one's flying through China here on trees like in Crouching Tiger, it's just guns and fists and a lot of violent punching and kicking, not to mention some exciting takedowns involving windows, machetes, and exploding refrigerators.)
- Best. Villain. Ever. Not the drug-lord guy, he doesn't really do anything, but Mad Dog, his protector, who is portrayed as a maniac...And he really is. The title of ""Mad Dog"" fits him perfectly, as he just detonates into a fury of complex martial arts when he gets into his fights, all of which are very exciting. He clearly and openly seeks out challengers for hand-to-hand combat among everyone there, since he often gives the good guys tremendous advantages on purpose just so he can have some sort of fun. He never uses a gun because, as he says, ""I never liked these things. Pulling a trigger to kill someone is just way too simple. It's like ordering take-out."" He literally positions two characters between him at one point before a fight just for the hell of it, like fighting one at a time isn't any fun at all and no challenge whatsoever. And who can blame him? You just can't stop this guy from beating the life out of everyone he comes across. He lives to fight hand-to-hand, and that's it. Screw guns, they're just a nuisance. He has this fanaticism of killing people with his bare hands, purely for the rush, to the point that he literally gets bored with fighting normally and intentionally ups the difficulty for himself (such as the aforementioned two-on-one he sets up for no real reason except his own pleasure). Yeah, he's one scary bastard.
- The Dragon of the film, Mad Dog, has his own finishing move, and it's not what you think. It's freaking frightening.  When he first uses it, it's just insane and unbelievably violent, yet signature for him. He's one scary bastard, even with a gun pointed at him.
- Crazy-cool protagonist who does a great job being a protagonist who can beat the crap out of anyone without mercy, you know, for justice.
- The police sergeant is also really cool and authoritative in his own way, and he definitely isn't all talk and no action. He also comes off as pretty intelligent along with being fierce. Nicely done character.

Cons:
- The plot is virtually identical to Dredd. Seriously, if you haven't seen Dredd, this is the film, just in a different context and with a higher budget. Even some of the scenes seem strikingly similar. Menacing drug lord on a high floor? Check. Sealed inside? Check. The practice of buying police to protect the drug lord from police? Check. Residents told to fight protagonists? Check. Drug lord on top floor watching everything through monitors? Check. Some similar spoilers? Check. Drug lab fight scene? Um...Yeah, check. I could go on, but yeah, pretty much the same movie, except Dredd was, well, Judge Dredd.
- For better or worse, and maybe not really a con, every single person in this film--all of which are oriental--seem to know advanced martial arts, even the freaking guys making meth who are minding their own business. Yes, it has that thing where every single Asian character knows martial arts, like they're somehow born with it. The meth lab guys are a real piece of work. There's no reason for them to know any type of self-defense, but they're still skilled enough to give the protagonists a good fight.
- The story initially appears to be the dumbest thing you've ever seen in your life and makes zero sense. This isn't a spoiler: The police can't handle when the power is cut. Yeah, apparently no one thought of that and brought so much as flashlights with them.
- The box says ""30 Floors of Hell"". There aren't 30 floors, there are clearly 15. The drug lord's on the 15th floor. What's with the extra 15 floors we never see?
- The box also says, iirc, ""15 Elite Cops"". But they aren't, they're rookies. That's not because they do stupid things, but because they're pointed out to almost all be rookies early in the film. So, uh, that's a lie. Not a big one, since the main characters can still kick enough ass for all of them combined, but these definitely aren't ""elite cops"". See: Flashlight problem, mentioned above.
- Gunplay is a bit over-the-top, since *everyone* uses fully-automatic assault rifles that apparently don't need reloading (do they ever replace their magazines?) throughout the film. Some might not mind that, but one Commando is enough. There is no unit on the planet that uses fully automatic weapons for the simple reason that it's a dumb idea, and when they're all *missing* with that wasted ammunition, it kind of destroys the effect. They might as well be semi-autoing, you know, like every police or military unit does in close-quarters combat.
- That thing regarding Andi...Well, not so well done. For his significance, he felt horribly underdeveloped, considering his key role in the film. They say a few sentences about him and that's it, despite that he turns out to be really, really significant. Well, whatever, no spoilers.

SUMMARY:
Okay, so that sounds like a lot of negatives, sure, but they're not that bad. The pros make up for it. It's not too long, it's stylish, and it gets its job done. Sure, the plot's about as deep as a generic PlayStation 2 shooter, but that's not necessarily an awful thing. It's a dumb popcorn flick, after all, and isn't supposed to be anything else, so no points off.

Just remember: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE STUPID REMIX. And while you *may* be able to stomach the dub, it *does* suck. You'll probably choose subtitles, and you'll definitely want the original audio, which is paradoxically a lot more intense and heavy-metalish (as opposed to the downright strange and even boring electronic/nu-metal Linkin Park thing they threw on there) than the remix.

Go for it if you want nothing but the dumbest of action and you like violent martial arts. Just remove the ""Redemption"" piece of it in favor of the much-better basic ""The Raid"" and you'll be good.",1381968000,7,7306,4.736635220125786

2725193,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Most everyone who has seen this movie agrees the action and martial arts in The Raid is great. There's a lot of shooting (over the top, really) but that goes away very soon into the movie, and we are left with some inspiring fighting scenes. Granted, you had better like these kinds of movies or you'll be grossed out. Very realistic -- except (like the endless magazine of bullets) for the tireless energy of our fighters. These guys have really been eating their Wheaties or, more likely, their nasi lemak because they never tire out! From a more analytical point of view, The Raid is a joy to watch for the fighting techniques and choreography: the punches, kicks, sweeps and trips -- all part of the Southeast Asian martial arts of silat (somewhat related to Filipino eskrima).

Some reviewers criticize The Raid for being long on action and short on story. Yes, but, there's enough story to drive the movie and stir the emotions. By the way, the guy you even end up rooting for may be the bad (""maniac"") guy. Small guy who believes in the purity of the fight.",1380585600,,1064,4.570680628272251

2725199,5,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid stands in defiance of the American action film

While most of our action films either feature superheros in front of a green screen, actors who don't know how to fight hidden by ""Shakey cam"" or muscle heads who mow down endless waves of bad guys with machine guns, The Raid is something else entirely

The entire plot is summed up in the heading above the title and is explained in the first 15 minutes. A group of cops are sent to an apartment complex that houses a drug kingpin and who's occupants are the criminal scum of the city. When he see's that he's being invaded, he announces over the intercom that whoever takes out the cops get's a months free rent.

While other movies start out with an opening action sequences, a middle one to keep you interested and a grand finale, The raid inverses that. It opens with the setup, goes to action, a little plot in the middle to keep the movie together, then some more action, and then a grand finale (because more action)

What is this ""action"" I keep mentioning? The star of this film is Iko Uwais, a martial artist the films creators discovered while making a documentary on the style he uses. He's a fighter first and an actor second. The rest of the cast is made of practitioners of the same martial art and BOY does it show. The fight choreography is incredible and rather than hide their moves with jump cuts and editing, the filmmakers utilize wide angle shots and show you the fights in all their glory. The music from Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda just adds to the pulse pounding excitement of the film.

In case you haven't gotten my point yet, this movie is an action junkies dream, provided you dig martial arts. I highly recommend this film to anybody who wants to see some good old fashioned Kung Fu",1376352000,,1770,4.46749226006192

You've got your classics like Enter the Dragon and 36 Chambers to Bloodsport, Above the Law, The Matrix, Iron Monkey, Ip Man, District B13, and my personal favourite of all time, Brotherhood of the Wolf. I thought I'd seen the best and worst of martial arts and then, a friend of mine told me to catch this flick. He said it was good, but little did I know what I was in for.

YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!! That's all I have to say. If you love marital arts, non-stop action, minimal story, and to be blown away, this is for you. Not going to even give you a brief synopsis.

2725219,4,B000M4RG0Q,"First off: this film was intense. The story itself was cleverly designed to take full advantage of its location, and its talented performers. It was filmed and edited for maximum impact, without a wasted word or shot.

A SWAT team is sent to take out a crime boss, in a building full of criminals.

About ten minutes into this film I thought: I've seen this, or something very like it, before.

The basic scenario is a lot like the recent reboot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dredd/dp/B00ARF92HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dredd</a>&nbsp;with Karl Urban: hopelessly outnumbered law enforcers get trapped in an apartment complex run by a ruthless criminal overlord, who then offers a reward to the residents for their assassination. Of course Dredd is science fiction, and this one focuses more on martial arts than gunplay, but they are otherwise quite similar.

It turns out I'm not the only one who thought this; but it seems that the overlapping plots are mere coincidence, as both projects were being developed at the same time by different people.

Both films are worth watching for lovers of intense, action-packed thrillers. I tend to prefer science fiction to action - but I actually liked this film better than Dredd because the martial arts on display was nothing short of astonishing. The plot was thin - but here the editing for intensity, and the talented performers was more than enough to keep me watching and on the edge of my seat.",1371254400,,1496,5.216666666666667

2725240,4,B000M4RG0Q,"The only reason to watch this movie is to immerse yourself in glorified violence.  If that's your goal, then you won't be disappointed.  The action scenes are fast, intense and well choreographed, and it's a pleasure to watch rising star Iko Uwais in action (he reminds me of Tony Jaa).  The story (such as it is - it's an action flick after all) revolves around a rookie cop who's a member of a SWAT-type unit tasked with taking down a notorious crime lord who lives on the top floor of a tenement building.  The building is full of every kind of low-life imaginable, and soon the assault team is fighting for their lives as the crime lord turns everyone in the building against them.

The problem I have with this movie is that it doesn't keep up its momentum.  The first half of the film is hard-hitting and relentless as the assault team is surrounded and has to fight room-to-room, floor-to-floor.  The gunplay is for the most part well done.  Then, the movie transitions into martial arts mode, and despite some spectacular fights, the tension isn't sustained.  Another problem I have with this movie is how the transition from gunplay to martial arts is made.  After the assault team is reduced to a mere handful of officers, they start discarding weapons left and right.  I know, it's a martial arts film, but it still has to make sense.  If I were surrounded by crazed killers, I sure as hell wouldn't be deliberately dropping my weapons.  Furthermore, it's just too convenient that once the police lose their weapons, the bad guys start attacking with edged/blunt weapons and bare hands.

It's not a perfect action film, but don't let that stop you from watching this.  The fight scenes are a delight to watch, and bad guys are dispatched in some interesting ways.  Get your testosterone fix here.",1366502400,,1807,4.688888888888889

2725244,5,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid: REDEMPTION is an Indonesia Martial Arts film which captures the spirit of 80s/90s martial arts films but enhances them with the cinematography, camera styles, and musical tastes we've become accustom to. A bit of a slow starter, the film sets up a simple premise: a SWAT team are given orders to capture a ruthless drug lord and attempt a surprise attack on the building he resides in. The situation quickly escalates into a fight for their very survival. JAKA, the team captain, just wants to get everyone out - while RAMA has an agenda he seeks to keep from the rest of the team. Very simple premise, ample characterization and some awesome fight sequences.

That said, this movie isn't for the faint of heart: it's graphic - lots of violence, lots of blood with the ability to make you cringe at certain scenes (one involving a door, the other involving a ledge). The Bluray comes with the movie - no DVD copy.

My biggest complaint about the product: The UV copy of the film is NOT in English - it is in subtitled English. It's a pain in the ass to claim through VUDU but as of last week, signing up through VUDU also allowed you to get ten free movies in addition to the Raid. Not bad. The Bluray itself is in dubbed english (which means English voice actors spoke translated dialogue - it fits quite nicely) and you can choose whether you want the original soundtrack or the retooled one created by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park.",1366243200,2,1443,4.524904214559387

All you need to know about this movie to know what's going on, is that the main character has something to fight for, and the villain is as sick, and rutheless as they come. Leave all that other stuff to imagination. Cause I tell ya, what they did with this one is absolutly astounding. I had heard that this was a good one but truly didn't know what I was in for. What I got was one of the most gritty, brutaly violent, awesomly choreographed martial arts movies I seen in a long time. And I just had given this same credit to Universal Soldier:Day of Reckoning. But that movie has got nothing on this one. When they
fell through the floor and one of the
henchmen gets three to the face at close
range,I knew I was in for some ish. Iko is one of the best I've seen since Jaa, with an extra notch because the boy has got screen presence.

Another thing I loved about this movie is everybody was sick with the Silat! It wasn't just ""oh he's better than everybody"", he actually had a hard time! But any way ' nuff said.

2725259,5,B000M4RG0Q,"THE RAID: REDEMPTION is one of the most successful movies I've seen in YEARS.  It's not the greatest movie, by a long-shot...but the gap between its ambition (which is pretty high) and its actual accomplishment is almost non-existent.  I've long believed that movies need to be judge, in part, on how well they accomplish what they attempt, and not just how ""good"" they are by some high-brow, artsy standard.  Thus, a low-brow comedy like KNOCKED UP can get 5 stars from me because while it isn't great art, it meets or exceeds all its own goals.  And by the same token, a gorgeous, ambitious, ""serious"" film like, oh, let's say ANNA KARININA only gets 3 or 4 stars, because its reach so far exceeds its grasp.

THE RAID: REDEMPTION is darn near perfect.  It wants to be a nearly non-stop, adrenalin-fueled, ultra-violent, martial-arts heavy action movie.  It tries to strike a balance between incredible tension and the visceral release of that pent-up tension.  It wants to shock and awe.  And it does.

Set in Indonesia, we meet a group of heavily armed and armored cops who are planning a raid on a very tall apartment building.  At the top of this building sits the city's most vicious crime lord, along with his two cruelly effective henchmen.  Beneath them, for floor after floor, is a seemingly endless string of bad guys, the scum and villains of the town.  The cops must fight their way from bottom to top...and once their presence is exposed the viciousness and intensity of the fight is nearly ceaseless.

The movie, while not based on a videogame, is the best example of a videogame movie I've seen.  Granted, that's a low bar...but THE RAID clears that bar so effortlessly.  The action sequences, which start with gunplay and then devolve first to knife play and then hand-to-hand combat, are among the best I've seen.  I've never been a huge fan of the MMA/martial-arts type of combat, where the hero and his foe kick, punch, block, flip, etc.  But I've NEVER seen so many fights staged so brilliantly or executed with such brutal fervor.  This is no exaggeration...during some of the action sequences, I found myself on the edge of my seat, talking to the screen (or yelling at it).  I simply DO NOT do that, yet I couldn't help it.  I was engrossed and engaged.

Yes, there is a bit of a story.  We are introduced, perfunctorily, to several characters and we do learn a few things about them.  There is even a bit of a surprise relationship that is revealed late in the film.  There are moments for dialogue and for catching a breath.  I wouldn't say the dialogue is brilliant or the acting Oscar caliber...but it is a little better than one might expect.  Iko Uwais plays Rama, our young hero...and he's a convincing screen presence (and a helluva fighter).  This is the kind of movie that relies on archetypes to gives us a shorthand for understanding the characters.  The heroic rookie, the guy with the smart-aleck remarks, the leader with a secret, the potentially corrupt higher leader, the insane bad guy, etc. etc.  What THE RAID does, however, is take these stock characters and put them in nearly perfect motion for maximum impact.  Gareth Evans wrote, directed, edited and co-choreographed the film.  In my mind, his is one of the most singular accomplishments in recent film history.  Again, his goals are not exactly lofty or ennobling.  But I can barely conceive how he managed to succeed so well where so many others have tried and failed.

This is a brutal film, and many viewers will not be able to finish watching it.  Some will find it glorifies violence or is just deeply depressing in its depiction of insane violence.  For me, it was a rush from start to finish.  It was a punch to the gut, but it was somehow uplifting as well.  It's simplicity of plot and tightness of purpose set it up to succeed beyond anything I could have expected.  I had heard it was good, but was skeptical.  ""Surely that's just fanboys and genre nuts talking,"" I said to myself.  But I was wrong.  Evans and his talented team delivered one of the most thrilling movies I've seen.  Wow!",1363305600,6,4101,4.659693165969316

I mean, I'm a middle-aged woman and I'd rather watch a bad martial arts film than a good chick flick or rom-com. But The Raid: Redemption blows up both the martial arts and cop drama genres with a strong, fascinating story, brilliant cinematography and perfect, crisp martial arts sequences. Yes, you've seen all these themes before, but never in a package like this. I knew nothing of the story before we watched it, so every revelation was a great pleasure. It is violent and there is blood, so keep that in mind, but if you like cop dramas or martial arts flicks, I recommend this film without reservation.",1361145600,,701,4.52755905511811
2725270,5,B000M4RG0Q,"What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? It has quite possibly the MOST gore and violence that I have ever seen packed into ONE movie! The way it was filmed was also very original. There are a few tense, suspenseful scenes but that usually means it will soon EXPLODE into chaos, fast, crazy camera work and extreme violence, shooting, killing, fighting and explosions.

For those of you who want some long, detailed plot explanation there really isn't one. What you read in the description and see in the trailers is basically what you get but with a lot more blood. It's a raid. Things get ugly and tons of people die in really crazy, gory ways. It had a great ending though it was a pretty typical one for an Asian martial arts film. It does have subtitles but even without them it's NOT hard to figure out what is going on. This is a movie about what happens when the you-know-what hits the fan...people fight, people die and people do very bad things...the end!

So it wasn't the best quality movie ever...It didn't have the best budget and it doesn't have any well-known actors with their shirts off...BUT it did have pretty good intensity and realism from the actors which is rare in an action movie. It had insane martial arts moves. It also had really violent, clever and gory scenes filmed in ways that have not been done before and it scores major uniqueness points for all the crazy death scenes.

The best thing about this movie was that my boyfriend LOVED it! It's probably not a good ""date movie"" but then again, it depends on who your date is. There are those ladies out there (ME!) who like a good action movie too. If you are offended by extreme violence this probably isn't the movie for you. If you happen to enjoy non-stop action, fighting, shooting, blood and a high death-toll in a film, then this movie will deliver all that and more. I have to say it is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. There was never a dull moment and I give it five stars for being SO freaking insane!",1360972800,,2036,4.453083109919571

The language is very explicit and is similar to Scarface with its F-bomb usage.  The plot is very thin, so check you brains at the door.

Is hard nowadays to find really really good action movie, but not this time. It has a very basic story, that's actually very interesting, it's simple and very easy to follow. In fact, is so easy to follow, that you never miss a moment of action because of the plot, nor the other way around. The construction of the narrative is very entertaining and the fights are just incredible.
It all happens in one building, and we follow the extreme action from the first to the last floor.
The music shapes the pace of the fights and also has a second soundtrack made by Mike Shinoda that is quite the treat.
In the Extra Material Area the ""Making of"" is pretty awesome, you can check how it was choreographed and what kind of Martial arts and modification of it they used.

2725282,4,B000M4RG0Q,"Welsh born writer-director Gareth Evans has taken cinema to a new level with his latest movie the Raid: Redemption, and that is that he has successfully translated film into the realm of video game. Let me explain, the Raid: Redemption tells the story of an Indonesian S.W.A.T. team that lays siege on a corrupt apartment building housing various low lives and criminals. The story progresses as the heroes go floor by floor battling it out with their nemesis.

Now, I know that this doesn't sound like very much, and what it does sound like doesn't exactly sound good. The real surprising thing is, that it is good, very good. This movie lives up to the term, it moves, and it moves rapidly. Through a keen lens director Evans, who also did the film's exhausting editing, keeps the action and the pace at a breakneck speed utilizing expert cinematography from Matt Flannery, everything is clear and focused in a jaw dropping visual style that it makes it difficult to blink.

Played out over loud rock music, the picture barely has time for character introduction let alone development. This could have hampered the film, but everything is going so fast that it would be wrong to slow it down. there is a lead protagonist, portrayed by star of Evans previous movie Merantau, Iko Uwais, who also choreographed the film's incredible action scenes. He is reduced to easily expectable clichs (pregnant wife, conflict with brother on the wrong side of the battle) that is more inline with caricature.

The whole bloody affair comes across like an easily digestible cross between the Warriors and John Carpenter's Assault on Percent 13. Which is all right by me because the movie remembers the first rule of filmmaking and that is to make it cinematic. This could not have been a novel, even the script must have been a poor read, but it will appeal to fans of first person shooter games and martial arts pictures. If I fall into any category it would be the latter, if you fear you may not enjoy the film because your no gamer, well take it from me, you've got nothing to worry about. I am no gamer myself, I all, but detest the idea of wasting my time for hours on end feeding a machine my valuable life expectancy for a tedious fruitless exercise. This movie is more rewarding than any game, only just as much fun.

2725293,5,B000M4RG0Q,"First thing is first - don't expect much in the way of plot development in this story.  A group of a police unit (like a SWAT team) are raiding a criminally-run building.  The building is run by a crime-lord and at first, we are to assume that taking him down is the ultimate goal.  As we go on, we see that our main character, a member of the police unit, is actually trying to extract his criminal brother from the building.  That's basically it.  There is a very small twist at the end, but plot-wise, this is pretty thin.  It's basically an excuse to drive the action.

And my god, the action.  I'm an MMA addict/student for the past 15 years, and for me, the fight scenes in this flick are sublime.  The characters are practicing Silat, which in many ways resemble muay thai.  In many ways, this movies does for silat what Ong Bak did for muay thai.  The action is fast and incredibly brutal.  No shaky camera work here either.  We get to see these fights unfold without any trickery.  There are no sommersaulting kicks pr magical punches here.  These people are fighting for their lives, and damn it, it's convincing.  The shootouts are also very well-done.  There isn't a ton of gunplay, but what is there is satisfying.

Long story short, if you love action movies and haven't seen this, I can all but guarantee you won't be disappointed.  And be prepared for one of the most badass fights ever put to celluloid as this films comes to a close.

The man cuts through bad guys like knife through butter. And he had some of those literally. And Mad Dog is one tough mother. The 2 on 1 fight at the end may be the best fight in years.

Some didn't even watch the movie, but gave it 1 star. Yes thank you for your ""review"".

Yes this is a violent movie. If you don't like great fight choreography, then move along. This movie makes very good use of the martial art called Silat practiced in South-East Asia. This is a niche film that caters to those that love great fight scenes from actors that actually know a martial art instead of acting like they do.

This is a great pickup for fans of the genre and something to add to the collection if you're familiar with the director's (Gareth Evans) other movie (Merantau).",1357171200,3,637,4.521739130434782

2725319,4,B000M4RG0Q,"Purchased the Bluray without having seen the movie. From the beginning The Raid's plot lacks any type of substance, with only enough to keep you going from point A to B. Its apparent this movie was made solely for the absolutely amazing hand-to-hand fight scenes. Wonderfully choreographed and visceral, the fights never get old.

Unfortunately you do have to drudge through all but forty minutes before the first non-gun fight scene happens. As expected in a dubbed movie the voice acting is just awful, but aside from that the audio is awesome. Every crack of gun fire, snap of bone, and slash of knife if perfectly clear and pulls you right in.

Overall I'm happy with my purchase. This is a great popcorn ""kung fu"" movie aside from the terrible voice dubbing and vapid plot.",1356393600,2,778,4.7555555555555555

But the scenes in The Raid totally do. There is a lot of gun violence in the first half but once the hand-to-hand combat kicks off it never lets up. There are some incredibly intricate and lengthy fight scenes, particularly the final showdown where it's two against one. The fighting is a perfect mix between carefully choreographed and clearly trained moves and wild-eyed, fight to survive pummeling, which makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen. Some other reviewers have said there's not much plot but I thought the brother vs. brother storyline as well as the crooked police lieutenant were solid enough plotlines for a movie that's entirely about the action sequences.

It's been a while since an action film delivered such non-stop excitement. The plot is simple and easy to follow.

2725340,4,B000M4RG0Q,"Having been based in Indonesia, Evans wanted to bring Indonesian martial arts, known as pencak silat, into the world of cinema and he would do just that in 2009 working with actor and Pencak Silat expert Iko Uwais in the film ""Merantau"".

The film would gain a lot of attention from audiences at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Texas and eventually win ""Best Film Award"" at Action Fest 2010.

So, Evans and Uwais collaborated for an even bigger project known as ""The Raid"" (a.k.a. ""The Raid: Redemption in the U.S.) in 2011.  Originally planning a large scale prison gang film, the film proved to be too complex and time consuming, but most importantly too expensive. So, a plan for creating a SWAT team taking on drugdealers became the main storyline that Evans would focus on.

With a smaller budget, Evans worked about four months in finalizing the script, having translated from English to Indonesian and working with Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian in developing the choreography.  Actors that made up the SWAT team were sent to bootcamp military training with KOPASKA (the premier frogman and underwater demolition unity of the Indonesian Navy) and learned how to use the basics of weaponry, strategic attacks and defensive techniques.

After the film was created, Sony Pictures Worldwide acquired the distribution rights and brought it Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park along with Joseph Trapanese (""Traitor, ""Tron: Legacy"" and ""Tron: Uprising"") to create the new musical score for  the film.

Since the film's screening at various film festivals, ""The Raid: Redemption"" has received rave reviews as one of the best action films created not only in 2012 but also within the last decade.

VIDEO:

""The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  It's important to remember that the film was low budget and shot with a Panasonic AF100.  While the AF100 is a very good video camcorder optimized for HD video, one can't expect too much from this low budget film.  But with that being said, while the picture quality may not be the best for the videophile as it does have banding issues and because it is shot indoors most of the time with scenes with lighting to little lighting, it is what it is.  It's not a vibrant film but picture quality is good but not great!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition"" is presented in Indonesian/Bahasa and English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Portuguese, Spanish (Latin and Castilian) 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Once again, this film is low budget but on the good side, Sony did bring in Mike Shinoda to revamp the musical score (you have a choice of selecting the original or Shinoda's musical score), so the new digital music score does sound good through the front and surround channels.  The bad side is that for a film that does utilize a ton of gunfire, it would have been great to incorporate a more immersive soundscape and directional sounds with bullets whizzing from one end to the other.

Gareth Evans is still a filmmaker playing multiple hats in the film as director and editor but I hope for his next film, he does take advantage of lossless audio and making it more immersive.  Granted, I understand this film is a low budget and because of that, the lossless soundtrack is good, but it could have been better.

As for the acting, I prefer watching foreign language films in their own language but for those who hate reading subtitles, will be happy to know that this Blu-ray release does come with an English dub.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Portuguese, Spanish (Latin and Castilian).

JUDGMENT CALL:

Typically when I see soundbytes of a popcorn action film being called ""Best Action Film of the Year"" or ""One of the Best Action Films in the Last Decade"", I am often quite skeptical and try not to expect so much, to prevent myself from being disappointed.

I've watched a lot of action films throughout my life, especially martial arts films.  So, when I first heard about ""The Raid: Redemption"", I approached the film with interest because it incorporated the martial art style known as Pencak Silat, shot in Indonesia by a Welsh filmmaker and featured music by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda.  So, it's an interesting approach as I was not familiar with Gareth Evans work and was wondering why a Welsh filmmaker was in Indonesia and how Mike Shinoda took part in the film.

But I started watching ""The Raid: Redemption"" and realized this film was going to be violent, possibly bloody and there is going to be a lot of fighting and weapons.  And in some way, it reminded me of older '80s Shaw Bros. films such as ""Hong Kong Godfather"", where the small amount of people who represent the good, take on a large force which consists of the bad.  And for those who have watched enough martial arts films, there is a banality to these martial arts films but its all about execution.

""The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition"" is an exciting non-stop action film that just keeps coming at you.  Action scene after action scene, you're just captivated by this fatalistic suicide mission.  It's one thing to have 20 elite SWAT team members, but it's another thing to go against dozens of gangsters, drug users that live in the 15+ story apartment building.  You know the body count will be high but you are pulling for the rookie, Rama.  Rama represents the clean cut family man who happens to be a rookie of the SWAT team but also the more reserved member who can kick ass!

The fight scenes showcasing pencak silat is amazing!  What I enjoyed about the approach of fighting choreography for this film is to not having these fight scenes perfectly choreographed.  Mistakes happen, there is no clear edge of who will win and as Iko Uwais who plays the main protagonist Rama was pretty cool in execution, actor Yayan Ruhian who plays the evil ""Mad Dog"" is amazing.  At first, I thought this was your typical skinny guy with a gun, but instead this guy was showcasing silat movement that is so slick and smooth, you start to realize that this is the guy who will be doing the butt kicking and are not sure any of the good guys including Rama have a chance against him.

But the violent action scenes are intriguing at times, where one stab is not enough, some disable or kill their enemy, may it be an axe to the neck or repeated stabs to the heart, the fight scenes are violent but it fit the moment where these SWAT team people have to use what they can to survive.

But there is an opposite to all this that made me scratch my head at times.  Where we see other SWAT team members using their knives or whatever they have to fight, Rama was one who chose to use his fists instead of the weapons that lie around the ground.  There were times where I was asking myself, is this guy ever going to pick up a weapon on the floor to fight back?  These guys are coming at you with machetes and there are police batons, machetes, guns laying around, is he going to fight back.

Also, when the SWAT team are fighting, you would think that it would be beneficial to them to take the ammunition from fallen SWAT team officers, just in case.  But I had to remind myself that this is a popcorn action film, and not to think so seriously about character motivation or logic.  It's a popcorn action film meant to to be enjoyed for its action, not a film for one to  think too deeply about situations.

As for the Blu-ray release, there are over a 100 minutes of special features but I noticed that many of them involved Mike Shinoda, which was cool but it would have been cooler to have the Indonesian talent featured as well.  It would have been great to feature more interviews with Iko Iwais, Joe Taslim, Donny Alamsyah, Yayan Ruhian, Pierre Gruno, Ray Sahetapy and more.  As for the picture and audio quality, while I'm sure on DVD, this film would look and sound very good... on Blu-ray, it's not the most vibrant film and you do experience some banding issues.  And you tend to wish that there was much better sound editing to make this film much more immersive for the audiophiles who expect a lot from action-intense films.

But when it comes to a martial arts film with non-stop action, I will admit that ""The Raid: Redemption"" is a pulse-pounding, exciting action film and I have to agree... it is one of the better action film that I have seen within the last decade and yes, this year.  Gareth Evans and crew were able to utilize what they had, with what small budget and equipment they had at the time and they succeeded in creating such a fantastic, kick ass, all-action film!

Overall, if you love action films, ""The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition"" is a must-see!",1354320000,2,10251,4.73716864072194

2725342,2,B000M4RG0Q,"I think my title says it all.

2725367,5,B000M4RG0Q,"""The Raid: Redemption"" is a great example of pure action movie. You don't have to talk about it to tell someone what this amazing film is all about. You just have to show it and they will understand. It is an action movie with real martial artists, directed by someone who knows action choreography. Despite some lulls and an unnecessary plot twist, ""The Raid: Redemption"" is one of the best action films I have ever seen.

Rama (Iko Uwais) is a rookie officer and member of a SWAT team organized to apprehend a crime lord Tama Riyada (Ray Sahetapy), who owns and lives in a 30-storey building in Jakarta. However, the surprise attack by the special armed police ends up with gun fights and martial arts combats between the officers and the thugs, and a bloodbath and body counts that outdo the famous Aobaya fight sequence in ""Kill Bill.""

The film's rather simple story is mostly set in the apartment block where Rama and other officers are trapped. Directed by Welsh-born Gareth Evans with confidence, action-packed ""The Raid: Redemption"" wastes no time getting down to business with minimum back story about Rama the protagonist. We know he is a good guy who is married and going to be a father, and of course he is an expert fighter (later on, the film tells us more about his background, though).

That's all we have to know. The action stunts are hyperkinetic and violent, and aptly so. The Indonesian action film knows what it is doing. With tons of intense, bone-crunching martial arts stunts, it delivers what it sets out to do, and that's what matters to us.",1352678400,,1569,4.677536231884058
2725368,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I suppose I've little more to offer than just one more opinion of this heavily-reviewed film.  If I bring anything to the table at all it's a life-long love of martial arts films.  But the ability to compare and contrast different movies within a genre is really only relevant if the film stays within the confines of that genre.  ""The Raid"" is quite a bit more ambitious than your usual fight-flick but so is something like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Yet other than people getting kicked in the face the two films share very little in the way of similarities.  Where ""CT, HD"" attempts a traditional kung fu film with an epic scope and large cast, ""The Raid"" seems to attempt to make a full-on modern martial arts film that transcends that particular action category and into a few others in order to attract a more diverse audience while still giving regular fans more to be excited about than usual.  While director Gareth Evans and his crew were certainly successful in those two aspects, I don't feel the transcendence was complete.  By the time all's said and done, this really ends up being just a martial arts film.  But a really, really good one!

""The Raid"" tells the story of young officer Rama (Iko Uwais, soon to appear in the Keanu Reeves-directed ""Man of Tai Chi""), who leaves his cozy apartment and pregnant wife to enter a multi-story tenement run by gangster Tama (terrific Indonesian veteran actor Ray Sahetapy).  This building houses the kind of inhabitants who are more than willing to kill a cop in exchange for free rent or at least the waving of their security deposit.  This mission is lead by the crooked Lt. Wahyu (Pierre Gruno), who isn't too worried about Rama's inexperienced S.W.A.T. team accompanying him cuz they know nothing about his agenda and he's got the element of surprise on Tama.  Or does he?

Welsh director Evans previously helmed ""Merantau"", a more intentionally traditional fight-flick that displayed the Indonesian martial art of Silat in a modern setting.  Here he reunites with the likable and very capable Iko Uwais and choreographer Yayan Ruhian (who plays Tama's awesome main henchman, Mad Dog).  While I enjoyed the increasingly complex action in ""Merantau"" quite a bit, the intensity of the action from that film is amped-up here BIG TIME without sacrificing the filming techniques that fight-flick fans like myself feel should be utilized in all action films.  Ya know, the good ones where the wires are minimal, actors provide their own stunts, the choreography's fast and complex, cameramen keep their distance from performers, and the editing's smooth?  Yeah, baby, that's what I like and that's what ""The Raid"" delivers!  With good use of location and added brutality and gore!  Not for the kids and not for the squeamish.

The Sony/Stage 6 DVD has spoken languages in both (Bahasa) Indonesian or dubbed into English.  Subtitles available in English (with or without SDH) and Spanish.  Special features are loaded with 7 featurettes on stunts, choreography, interviews and music stuff.

If I were to register a complaint it would likely involve the ""Redemption"" part of the title, added to the American release.  Probably the most overused word to appear on DVD boxes EVER and one whose very definition brings its use here heavily into question.  It's appearance obscures the film's title rather than enhancing it.  Oh, well.  I assume there'll be several more movies over the next several years to haphazardly throw some redemption into the title or description.  Coincidentally, this is the most enjoyable martial arts film I've seen since 2010's ""Undisputed III: Redemption""!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

2011.  aka: The Raid",1352678400,,3686,4.995081967213115
2725369,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Rama (Iko Uwais; Merantau) and his SWAT team infiltrate the dangerous, goon-ridden lair of a criminal Demigod, Tama (he's like an Indonesian Javier Bardem).  Tama's building is festooned with dangerous tenants and Tama's bodyguards.  Like Dredd 3D, this movie is basically set up like a 90s videogame.  The SWAT team enters the building and conquers it one ""level"" (i.e., floor) at a time until they reach the ""the last guy.""  For whatever reason this building is basically unguarded and without surveillance on the outside, but loaded with danger on the inside which, again, adds to the videogame appeal.

Led by SWAT Sgt. Jaka (Joe Taslim; Dead Mine, The Fast and the Furious 6), the first few levels offer no challenge as they essentially just restrain (for future arrest) drug dealers, junkies and petty criminals.  But when somene hits the alarm, all criminal hands on deck are alerted to the police invaders.  We also learn, much to Jaka's surprise, that this mission is off the books and they can't call for back up.

Initially, the action focuses on gunfights.  I was less than thrilled with the occasional shaky camera-work during gun fight scenes, but it didn't terribly interrupt my enjoyment and this never happened during the martial arts scenes--and martial arts are basically all we get for the next hour!

Brutal, technical, graphic and gory.  There's some good use of slow motion footage, glorious axe-impaling action, close-up gun shots to the face, and more discharged ammunition than the Morpheus rescue scene in The Matrix.  Iko Uwais truly shocks and impresses during his first fight, a wide-shot tonfa-knife fight with about ten opponents and we get to see every single stab, kick and crush as he unleashes a flurry a supremely fast and elaborate, but clearly observed techniques.  VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!  The best part is that if they used any tricks, like wire work or 1.2x film speed, I can't tell.  They also kept the choreography, while utterly brutal, practical.  No jump spin kicks or gratuitous acrobats.  Just a flood of flesh-lacerating strikes including one of the most unique neck breaks I've ever seen!  Iko Uwais doesn't look like much, but he has truly proven himself to be a martial arts movie star!

Then there's Mad Dog (Vayan Ruhian; Merantau).  This guy is tiny.  I mean like young boy who doesn't play sports tiny, by American standards.  However, when he and Jaka (who is MUCH larger) fight you find his power shockingly credible.  They both handle complex choreography very well, Mad Dog much better than Jaka, and they produce a fight with techniques executed from realistic positions that I doubt I've ever seen on film before.

When Rama gets to the drug prep and processing floor, every single drug handler could have been the master of a martial arts school.  While this would be comically annoying in most American action hero-driven releases, I didn't mind a bit.  Why?  Because it added yet more action to a movie that seems to be non-stop action and the fight quality never majorly dropped with the insignificance of the opponent (i.e., those stunt men cast as drug handlers #1-12).

Mad Dog versus Rama and another tough guy...that was a treat.  Mad Dog may be small, but he fights like a rabid Chihuahua on steroids that just won't die!  Despite his tiny size, very clever choreography permits him just the right stance, credible momentum and position to throw or unbalance much larger, stronger opponents.  Rama is also small, but notably larger than Mad Dog.

This movie was AMAZING!  IF YOU LIKE THIS WATCH:  If you enjoy seeing truly innovative choreography that actually manages to make sense of small fighters demolishing larger and numerous opponents then you should really turn to movies by Jeeja Yanin (Chocolate, Raging Phoenix) and Tony Jaa (The Protector, Ong-Bak but not Ong-Bak 2 or 3).",1352678400,,3853,4.959438377535101
2725370,4,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid-Redemption(Released Sept/11)is an Indonesian film starring director Gareth Evans find,Iko Uwais as Rama,Donny Alamsyah as Andi,Ray Sahetapy as Tama Riyadi,Yayan Ruhian as Mad Dog,Pierre Gruno as Lieutenant Wahyu,Joe Taslim as Sergeant Jaka and others. This is a fast paced,hold on to your seat film,that never stops giving with the action and intensity.
The film opens as Rama,a cop,is at home,with his pregnant wife,preparing for a mission. In the SWAT truck on the way with his fellow police team,we learn they are all headed into a high rise apartment building. The building has been a drug and crime haven for years,presided over by one Tama. The hit is led by a Lieut. Wayhu.
Once inside the team goes undetected until about the 5th floor when all hell breaks loose. The building has an open square core to it,from which all hallways radiate from. It is an easily defended scenario and the tenants,many doing Tama's bidding,use this to their advantage,killing many cops all too quickly. The highest the team makes it to is the 7th floor and from there their decimated numbers must go downwards. To this end they literally chop open a hole in apartment floors and slip down that way. This only gets them a couple of floors,after which they must try to get out other ways. This ends up splitting the team up and decimating their numbers even more.
Along the way we learn that Lieut. Wayhu has put together this action by himself,with no ones authorization,r knowledge. Furthermore Wayhu himself has been a collector of debts for those corrupt officials higher up than himself,and figures wiping out Tama will score him brownie points with his bosses. Meanwhile Tama has sent forth two of his enforcers to comb the building for the now,four cops left. One,Mad Dog,is brutal,crazy and relentless. He confronts one cop,takes him into a room,and instead of using his gun to quickly dispatch him,fights him hand to hand. The ultimate result is not good for the cop. The other enforcer,Andi,kills the two men sent down the elevator with him. He then hides in a room and grabs Rama as he wanders by in the hallway and pulls him in. The two start a rather nonchalant conversation,the end result of which we find the two are estranged brothers. Rama tries to convince his brother to come with him,but he cannot leave the world he feels the most comfortable in.
Andi tells Rama to leave once the coast is clear,then leaves to join Mad Dog. Mad Dog drags the dead cops body up to his boss,while of course Andi has nothing to show for his walkabout. Tama unfortunately,has watched his security monitors and has seen Andi's betrayal. Tama lets Mad Dog take Andi to a room and torture him. Rama leaves the room and re joins Wayhu and the only cop left to protect him,Dagu. They work their way up to the top floor,and Rama temporarily leaves the two when he finds the room with Mad Dog and his brother. An epic battle takes place between the brothers and Mad Dog,taking all they have to defeat their ruthless foe. Up on the 15th floor the Lieut.has taken Tama hostage and has killed Dagu. As Wayhu comes down the stairs they meet up with the brothers,who he shoots at and who flee a little ways down. They listen to the conversation,as Tama lays out what has been going on with Wayhu's bosses,who will be none too pleased that Wayhu has taken it upon himself to snuff out a very lucrative source of income for them. Wayhu shoots Tama,then turns the gun on himself,except there are no bullets with which to end it all. Rama takes Wayhu into custody,finds one last remaining severally injured cop,and the three cops walk out of the apartment compound,with Andi's help. As the gate closes we see Rama leave and Andi walking back into the world he knows best.
The fight scenes are choreographed extremely well and the tension created rarely wains,as the cops are at first in control,then later fighting for their lives to get out. The criminals in this building,all seem to be in various states of drug inducement:wide eyed and totally devoid of a conscious. It is nothing for them to machete a person to death. The film is filled with very violent scenes like that which are not for the squeamish. One plot hole that I found that stuck out was when the drug lord outed Andi. He said he saw Andi pull his brother into a room,which of course condemned Andi to death. The building was indeed filled with cameras everywhere. So I do not know how the cops made it all the way to the fifth floor in the beginning,without being detected until a kid outed them,over just an intercom.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras abound and include:six featurettes,video blogs,a clay-mation version of The Raid and conversation with the director and others.
All in all this film has action is spades,with lots and lots of your typical Hong Kong style martial arts sequences. It is a taut good vs evil film,with a team of cops raiding a drug lord's apartment fortress. Things move well for the cops at the start,but it goes downhill quickly and they all must fight for their lives in short order. A solid four stars.",1352592000,,5144,4.6976744186046515

2725384,5,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid: Redemption is an Indonesian film directed by Gareth Evans. Iko Uwais is a cop with a baby on the way and is part of a SWAT team that must enter a decrepit apartment building that houses a vicious gangster and his many henchmen. The gangster presides on the 15th floor from a room which has many closed circuit cameras that give him  unrestricted viewing of the SWAT team as they enter the building. The plot is uncomplicated but there is a little backstory about the reason for the raid..
This movie is 103 minutes long and it is nonstop unrelenting action of a boot camp aerobic class. It highlights the martial arts of Indonesia called Pencak Silat. The pacing of the entire film is brisk and several fight scenes can be called classics. The scenes are furious and people use everything from their fists, machetes, refrigerators filled with gas cylinders, doors (really) to decimate each other. The action sometimes subsides but it is replaced by a nervous tension of `what is going to happen next'. The background music is outstanding as well.
The horror of getting stuck in a dirty squalid building and being hunted by dozens of blood thirsty killers is what makes the film so engaging to watch. Watch this film and tell me what your favorite kill scene is? The only con I found that is that this is not a movie that can be seen with the entire family as the violence is over the top and brutal. Five stars.",1350777600,,1421,4.55078125

You'll see about two minutes of back story before the intense and bloody violence begins, and don't expect it to let up anytime soon. The fights scenes are great and the choreography is marvelous, especially in the final fight scene. The director does a great job of building tension in the film and introduces a lot of wildly inventive action shots.",1350432000,,402,4.757142857142857

2725387,4,B000M4RG0Q,"Movie goes, especially in America, are intensely over-stimulated.  Major movie producers crank out over-polished CGI ""masterpieces"" that are so shiny, they tend to blind you to the movie itself.  Every now and then, we all need some unexpected quantity to walk up behind us, tap us on the shoulder and sucker punch us to let us know that it is still possible to make a really good movie without all the excessive flash.  The Indonesian movie industry has done exactly that with ""The Raid: Redemption.""

This movie is expertly filmed with exquisite fight choreography and once the action starts, it almost never stops.  The plot is somewhat shallow and the characters are underdeveloped, but this does not exactly detract from the film.  In fact, it aids in it's enjoyment as it frees the viewer up to enjoy this movie for that it is:  an ultra-violent blood bath.  The Raid: Redemption is well worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as such action movie classics such as Commando, Rambo: First Blood Part II, and the original Die Hard.

This is an action movie.  If you're looking for an intricate plot or deep characters, then you don't really want to watch an action movie.  If you're looking for some of the most epic violence you've ever seen, then this movie delivers and then some.",1350345600,,1295,4.762331838565022

2725393,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I've been looking forward to this movie since I saw the trailers over 6 months ago. I was not disappointed. Although it is a slow starter, don't give up, less than 10 minutes from the beginning, the action begins. And there is non stop action for then next 90 minutes.

The movie is set in Indonesia and stars 2 powerhouses, 1 is a Karate Champion and the other the martial arts choreograher of the movie. What makes it even more intersting is that they are secondary characters and on opposite sides of the law. The Star of the movie, IKO UWAIS, is AWSOME!

A SWAT team arrives at a 15 story building with the intent of taking down a drug boss and bringing him in. He is ruthless and smart, surrounding himself with people that can benefit him in different ways. What the SWAT team does not know is just how well fortified or how well guarded it is. They soon discover they have been setup and are trapped on the 6th floor surrounded by thugs,murderers and men that have just been given an open invitation and monetary incentive to take out the team by any means necessary; and it is brutal. Their survival now hinges on fighting their way out. Floor by floor action and mayhem ensues and IKO UWAIS gives us some of the best choregraphied fighting action scenes that will rival and surpass JET LI!

This movie is geat and leaves you tired, so intense is the fighting. Also check out the special bonus features as it will give you more insight as how they filmed it and what the director was going for. In this case he was spot on in both the action and the camaradie that he was hoping to interject in the plot.",1349568000,2,1612,4.366666666666666

A special forces unit in Jakarta goes into a drug lords tower to take him out, only the kingpin is expecting them, and they end up trapped, trying to fight their way back out. Simple. What wasn't simple was the choreography for the fight scenes. There were legitimately moves and acts in the midst of many of the fights that had me gripping my chair, tense, and thinking ""Holy @#$%"" or looking on with disgusted fascination.
Watch this movie. You need to see it if you love martial arts flicks.
Enjoy!",1349481600,,607,4.62962962962963
2725401,3,B000M4RG0Q,"Very similar in plot to the new Judge Dredd, but it lacks nothing for action. Fast paced and gritty, should be a good watch if you like martial arts and bullets.",1349481600,,161,4.225806451612903
2725402,5,B000M4RG0Q,This movie contained moments that were almost first person. It drew me in. The action was really good. I liked it a great deal,1349481600,,126,4.291666666666667
2725403,3,B000M4RG0Q,"This was a fun and exciting movie, the action is entertaining and the plot is good enough that it doesn't get in the way of what the movie really offers: violence. Anyone who likes action, especially martial arts, will probably want to see this movie. Whether you rent/borrow or buy depends a bit on you and I will offer my opinion on which you should do.

Plot/realism are a big deal to you: don't buy this movie. If you're going to spend the whole time stressing over the plot then it will probably spoil it for you. You should probably rent it and who knows, if you really like it you can still easily buy it and you're only one dollar down.

Uncomfortable around violence: if broken bones, explosions, knife wounds, and s excessive bleeding make you queasy you should probably pass on this film. It's pretty gory.

Looking for 100 minutes of action and suspense: this movie is for you. Definitely watch it, and if you like martial arts you should probably just buy it.

Can't read your native language and don't speak Indonesian (or whatever this language is): This is a foreign film, so obviously it's in a foreign language. I watched this movie with subtitles, I'm sure there is an English dubbed version but I'm unsure if it's on this DVD or not. To me the subtitles were just fine and I hardly thought about the fact that I was reading the words. I this bothers you, don't watch this movie.

Cons: Basically the acting is good enough (hard to tell when they're speaking a different language) but there are a few places where it's a bit rough. the plot is just OK (but really weak if you think about it). I was misled when I went into this movie, I read it was about ""elite"" cops doing a raid. You find out right away they are a rookie squad. This confused me and disappointed me just a little but it wasn't a huge deal.

Pros: this movie is really rather simple, but it does a lot of simple things really well. The music is great, really fits the moods. The martial arts choreography is exciting and fun to watch. The suspense is well done and the bad guy is really great.

Overall the movie is worth a watch.",1349481600,5,2117,4.385204081632653

2725406,3,B000M4RG0Q,"I wasn't overly impressed with this film, but I went in with extremely high expectations due to some positive comments made by my friends (who consider themselves to be film buffs of the genre). I don't consider myself as someone who appreciates everything films bring to the table. However, I do watch a considerable amount of films so I wouldn't consider everything I have to say about them to be complete nonsense. I'll just lay out a few bullet points and let you decide from there whether the film is worth your time.

-The film is good but not amazing.
 --It does the fighting stuff really well and presents it in a way that is entertaining for the majority of the flick.
 --It has a very ""raw"" feel to it, but you're reminded that it's just a film by the constant over the top fighting sequences and the ability for some of the characters to take hundreds of punches and still keep on going.

-This film is pretty much non-stop action from the moment the building raid begins.
 --That is pretty much a true statement.

-It's fun for what it is(an adrenaline-fueled kick to the face) but not ground-breaking for this sort of action/fighting genre either.
 --This is just an initial response. But then again I only watched the film once, so I imagine there could be some ""revolutionary"" bits in there that I didn't catch.

-Lots of kicking and body parts getting smashed or stabbed.
 --The kicking becomes a bit tiresome as the film drags on. They seem to try and make the film this one giant, cohesive, and interesting fight scene but it ends up feeling overly drawn out.

-If you like kung fu or action flicks (think in the vein of Ong Bak or True Legend) you'll probably enjoy this film.
 --It's a lot of acrobatic, in your face fighting. If you're not into that sort of thing, then this probably isn't the film for you.

-There is not much of a story here but I didn't rent this film expecting that.
 --To go in expecting an amazing storyline with fully developed characters and a plot that makes a whole lot of sense would be the wrong frame of mind for this particular film. There is a story there, but it's nothing memorable. This film is all about the action and trying to present it to you in a fun and interesting way.

Hopefully I've at least brought your expectations down to a reasonable level--if they were not already--so that the film could potentially be more enjoyable for you.",1349481600,,2400,4.525462962962963

2725409,4,B000M4RG0Q,"This movie showcases some of the most violent, nonstop martial arts action scenes ever put on screen. The plot is simple but with this much action and action done so well, the plot is almost immaterial. It is a full faced demonstration of how martial arts action should be seen on screen. There are a couple of surprises in the plot that make up for its simplicity. Overall, I give this film 4 stars because of its simple straightforward course but if it had been a little more cleverly worked up, it could easily have gotten 5 stars because the action was just that sensational. It was made in Indonesia and has subtitles but for those who can read, it is not a detriment at all. It illustrates how good it is to watch foreign films and how their ideas of violence and action effect the constitution of the overall movie. See it.

Mike Shinoda provided the unobstrusive soundtrack.",1349222400,,637,4.934579439252336

2725423,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Tony Jaa,......Iko Uwais.

I really enjoy martial flicks. I'm young, so I don't have an extensive knowledge, but I have seen nearly every Jackie Chan and Jet Li film made (yes all the vhs dubbed glory that it entails). My list of names at the top is in no way complete, it's just that when I think of badass martial arts, that make me giddy and giggly when watching the mayhem, I think of these people. Iko Uwais has firmly planted himself on this list with The Raid: Redemption.

The Raid is a flick that when you break it out for a group of guys that haven't seen it, it will get awesome. It's one of those movies that you have to be vocal during. The fighting is so brutal and darkly funny, that you can't help groaning and laughing. It starts off with lots of gun fighting, then segues into weapon fighting, before culminating with some brutal hand-to-hand. All of this is choreographed so naturalistically and just downright realistic.

If you don't like blood and deaths in your martial arts films, then this probably isn't the best choice.",1349136000,,1078,4.517948717948718
2725424,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I didn't really hear all that much about the Raid when it came out.  I just knew it was a foreign film and that's pretty much all I knew.
I got really interested about it when I saw all the very positive reviews it was garnering and especially when all of them were saying how inventive the action was in it.  I am a pretty big action fan so I was pretty excited.
After watching a 15 minute preview of this movie I knew I had to buy it then and there.  This is definitely one of the coolest action movies I have ever seen.
It's pretty much about a swat team stealthily clearing out a gang controlled hotel floor by floor before alerting everyone in the building and becoming trapped on the higher floors.  The movie is them trying to escape the building while the whole gang is coming after them.
The action itself is just fantastic and the way it's shot is perfectly done.  The entire movie had me diabolically laughing and cheering at how these few swat members forced death upon their many enemies.  It's just a very fun movie to watch if you're an action fan.
I highly recommend this film to anyone with any sort of interest in the action genre.  Yes, it is a foreign film so you will be reading subtitles but no matter what you're view is on that you will enjoy watching the incredible action this movie has to offer.",1348963200,,1322,4.285140562248996

It is also fair to note that two stunt men almost died during the making of this movie. This movie is for fans of action flicks in their most true form. There is a script and a story but, once that goes sideways, the movie boils down to survival! There are no apologizes or time for second thoughts in the movie or movies like this.

The one thing I didn't like is the fact that I barely knew any of the guys so if they were killed it didn't really matter cause you had no emotional connection to them. But putting that aside, this movie is bonkers. Basically the cops try to arrest a crime lord who houses other criminals in a highrise building and once the crimelord finds out they're there, he announces that whoever kills the cops gets to live there for free. And away we go! Crazy gun fights, hand to hand combat, explosions, knives, machetes,bats, good grief. Everything but the kitchen sink, buy they throw in a fridge so I guess that about does it.

I stumbled across the title on my local theatre's FANDANGO page checked out the online trailor and wound up seeing it that day. The action caught my attention, Mike Shinoda of LP co-producing the soundrack sold me on going to see it.  I dragged other friends and family to catch it with me a second and third time.  Indonesian with English subtitles but Ive found some of the best cinematic treats to be foreign and/or independent films.  This is no exception.

  (Incidentally, a bonus on the blu ray is the option for foreign dialogue with English subtitles or English dialogue voice over. -i recommend seeing it in its original dialogue first to capture the beauty and raw essence the way it was presented in the theatres first.  The english dialogue is great though for the visually impaired so that they won't have to struggle and read. But the english voice over at times makes me feel like the actors emotions were lost in trsnslation)

One of my Most favorite movies to date.  It has a Scar Face live or die feel to it.  Plot line is engaging and the artististic life or death martial art scenes are captivating. Its almost hard to believe these guys were actors. (IF YOU'RE A LINKIN PARK FAN you have to experience what Shinoda did with this awesome soundtrack)  Catch this movie at least ONCE.

2725483,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best, and writer/director Gareth Evans took a very simple one and turned it into an unrelenting, pulse-pounding and gleeful exercise in bone-crunching shoot-'em-up kickass action film storytelling with THE RAID: REDEMPTION.

The plot of the film is, as I stated, simple. On this particular day in Jakarta, Indonesia, an elite SWAT team is tasked with taking down a dangerous drug lord in the 30-story building that he controls and is populated primarily by that drug lord's thugs and enforcers, and the story and action of this film is told primarily through the eyes of a young rookie to the squad (Iko Uwais, also the film's martial arts choreographer). Once they've arrived, the cops find themselves trapped and under siege by the machine-gun-or-machete-wielding, martial-arts-trained psychopaths that occupy the building.

What sets this film apart from most other action films of this variety is the action scenes themselves. There is some fun gunplay to be had early on, but once our surviving protagonists are out of ammo, it's time to get creative with the martial arts. The film's star Uwais is a master of Silat, a martial art that is a little more fluid that Muay Thai but just about as brutal. The setting of the film as well as the mood is very claustrophobic, with most of the fighting taking place in single rooms and corridors and stairwells. The fight choreography is by far the most clever and impressive I've seen in many years, probably since Louis Letterier's UNLEASHED, and Evans allows the action and movement to flow and create its own energy and momentum without using MATRIX-y gravity-defying style or the typical reliance on slow-motion.

You know what else is pretty impressive about this film? The actual story and performances! There's some really nice character moments and some really interesting and well-played twisty-turny moments to the film as well.

The fight scenes aren't necessarily epic in scope like you might see in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, but the battles are epic in the brutal punishment the opponents dish out to each other. Every fight scene seems like it would be the final fight in a more Hollywood-ized martial arts film, but it's just par for the course for this film.

This film is more of a throwback to the late-80's/early-90's era of Hong Kong action cinema with allowing the film to be bloody and brutal, but with a real sense of dark comedy and over-the-top violence that seems very much in line with the combat of films like John Woo's HARD BOILED or THE KILLER.

Put simply, THE RAID: REDEMPTION is energetic, visceral and intelligent; certainly one of the finest pure action films in many years and is an absolute joy to watch for fans of action and fans of great filmmaking in general.

2725493,5,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid is by far the most insane action movie you will ever come across. I originally saw this in the theater during its brief run and was blown away by it then and was still blown away by it after watching it last night on Blu Ray. The movie starts sort of slowly (for about 10-15 minutes) by setting up who the main characters are and what is going on. After that, put your seat belt on because the next 80 minutes or so are a frenzy of gun fights, machete fights, martial arts fights and just general mayhem with enough break time thrown in for plot work and to give you time to relax. I recommend watching it in the Indonesian language setting because when I flipped on the English setting I noticed it took some wind out of the sails. The dialogue sounds like it was recorded in an empty room and felt like watching an old Godzilla movie that had been dubbed. Plus the big bad of the movie, his voice in Indonesian sounds much more evil than in the English version. Trust me or listen to it for yourself.",1347148800,,1011,4.216494845360825

2725495,5,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid: Redemption is an action/martial-arts film that follows a SWAT team's raid on a crime lord's impenetrable apartment building. It has some side plots, as well, but I'd rather not spoil it. Although it's a bit simple, the real reason to watch this film is for the non-stop action. The action sequences consists of stylish shootouts, violent machete/knife battles, and lightning-fast martial arts that rivals films like Ip Man (and many other modern martial arts films.) There are also plenty of tense scenes where they have to hide from and dodge multiple thugs, as well. This gives the audience a lot of variety and keeps us at the edge of our seats. Iko Uwais, as Rama, was great and I look forward to seeing more of him. I also like the camera angles this film uses because they're very stylish (I enjoyed the slow-motion in this movie) and engaging. Also, the pacing was very fast and it was over before I knew it.

Overall, The Raid: Redemption has a simple story, jaw-dropping action sequences, great acting, and great direction. I highly recommend this film, especially at the current $1.99 price (as of 9/8/12). Action fans will not be disappointed.

Forget about plot, forget acting, and forget characters; `The Raid Redemption' is all about adrenaline-pumping, smack-bang action and, on that front, it delivers commendably because, let's face it, it doesn't have much else going for it.

As the leading man, Iko Uwais is amazing and it's hard not to pump your fist in the air whenever he launches into action, delivering some well deserved comeuppance to ruthless criminals dumb enough to get in his way (pretty much all of them). The guy is in top form and his fighting skills are impressive to watch on screen.

The action itself is fast and oh so bone-crunching brutal; guys get their heads slammed against walls, backs get snapped, limbs are broken and people get stabbed several times in the blink of an eye, I winced every time something painful happened and yet I enjoyed watching the violence. I haven't felt this way since seeing `The Protector' with Tony Jaa. This is a film the action-junkies will eat up; just remember to check your brain at the door.",1346803200,,1253,4.818604651162791

2725521,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Have you ever watched a movie and afterwards thought to yourself ""Man, I wish I had more time on my hands...I want to watch that movie all over again right now!"" I can't say that I've experienced that feeling very often but I did after watching THE RAID: REDEMPTION. I didn't want to go to sleep, I wanted to do one of those college day deals where we stayed up all night and watched a movie over and over again.

Filmed and taking place in Indonesia, the movie starts off with a young SWAT officer waking and preparing for his day. He says goodbye to his wife and tells his father something that feels ominous, as if we're missing what is going on. We later find this to be true.

Once he meets the other SWAT team members they suit up and head out, being briefed on the way. Their goal is to take down the worst drug lord in Jakarta, a man who has holed up in a 30 story apartment building. Within the walls of the building the drug lord has regular paying tenants and some of the worst criminals in the country. They pay him to live there and aren't bothered by police. That's about to change as this SWAT team are about to enter the building with the goal of taking out the drug lord.

But you know what they say about the best laid plans. While the head of the group gives them information about what to expect and who to look for, nothing could prepare them for the day's events. The two main sidekicks to the drug lord offer the brains and the brawn of his team. One is the thinker, a man who helps plan things out while the other, the smaller of the two (which seems odd until later), is the more ruthless member. Both will play an important part as the film progresses and one will have a secret that some may figure out before it is revealed.

The SWAT team enters the building and has no problems at first that they can't handle. But as the reach the sixth floor things change when they are spotted and the signal is sent to the drug lord. Picking up his microphone he informs the tenants of his building via PA that they have ""pests"" in the building. Should anyone eliminate these ""pests"" he will grant them a free life time pass to stay in the building forever.

What follows is a rampage of street thugs and martial arts masters all doing their best to take down the SWAT team.  Many are gunned down from the start while the others do their best to get out of the stairwell and into some form of cover. But the bullets fly and machetes are wielded with ease as the combatants try to take out this dedicated team.

There are no words to describe the battle sequences these policemen find themselves in. The first amazing fight sequence takes place at about the 38 minute mark, a hand to hand combat scene that only lasts 2 minutes or so but that you'll find yourself rewinding to watch again. When I went back to watch sequences before writing this review that was the first spot I went to. It's followed by more sequences of amazing action and combat that first off is rare these days in action films more interested in chase scenes and secondly gives us a full view of the action rather than the close up shots seen in most action films these days. This movie captures the essence of action and never lets you go.

When I watched this film I watched it with the subtitles on the screen (it was shot in Indonesia but directed by a Welsh director). Fortunately for those who aren't willing to go the subtitle route, the film is subbed in English. This brings up the fact that the film is indeed foreign. But that shouldn't stop anyone from watching this film, especially if you are an action fan.

In looking back over the past year and the action films I've watched, I find it difficult to find another film that packs as much of a whollop as this film does. The only one that comes to mind is THE EXPENDABLES but that was released a year earlier. This is a movie that as an action film fan I wanted to make sure I had on my shelf. It's a film that I know I'll revisit from time to time. Looking at the behind the scenes moments offered in the special features I found it an even more amazing film to watch. Make a point of at least checking this movie out. As for me, I think I'll go fire up the DVD player and watch it one more time.",1346112000,,4249,4.235802469135803
2725522,1,B000M4RG0Q,"Watched this movie this weekend......I love movies with a collection 800+ films strong.  I cannot see what people see and rave about in this film.

It is like the worse Grindhouse martial arts film I have ever seen.....the dubbing is sometime extremely cliched and out of sync (reminds me of the American Pie scene after the first party ""Their tiger style kung foo is strong, but our dragon style will defeat them, the shaolin masters from east and west must unite... fight... and find out who is number one"".... with worse then Saturday B film dialogue.

The action yes is non stop but over and over and over with no real storyline or plot.

And be aware Ultraviolent and bloody here....which I can take (see Hellraiser and Kill Bill series)...but the violence didn't really fit except to string on scene to another to another to another and was there most times to make the movie be sensationalist and bloodier.

C'mon this, as some have said, is the best action film ever made?  The best martial arts film.....wow these people must have a very very limited collection!

The trailer looked brutal maybe to the point of being too brutal but happily the film never goes over the line - it draws near in some scenes but never fully crosses that line where you say ""Now I didn't need to see that."". As a fan of action films of the last 3 decades, I don't ask for much. Give me a decent villain, a great henchman, good guys getting their a** handed to them only to barely win and no outrageous, preachy rhetoric or messages and I am a fat, happy slob. The movie was just what I wanted and more. I have to say the fight choreography was some of the best I've seen in a long time (maybe since the first Ong Bak or Who Am I?). Watching this maybe me feel like I was watching one those great 80's action films. Simple, fun and jaw dropping. It may not be Shakespeare but it was no less entertaining.

Here's the scoop. A squad of cops in assault gear head to a dilapidated, 15 story, apartment building, to nab a real bad dude who has a sizable cadre of henchmen at his disposal. Things start out well enough but, of course, go so far south there is even question on how many of the cops will even survive the mission.

This is the third outing for Welsh writer/director Gareth Evans who filmed it in Indonesia. What a great idea. That alone must have helped enormously with the budget, and allowed him to turn out one exciting flick at a mere fraction of Hollywood dollars. And this is no mindless martial arts cum shoot-em-up. There are a lot of clever touches in the plotting that took me by surprise. The plotting itself is good. You have some scenes of extreme action followed by quieter scenes so things don't get overwrought, and the audience gets a chance to catch its breath.

The shooting scenes are generally good but the martial arts scenes are outstanding. The final fight, two good guys vs. one bad guy, is unbelievable. How they choreographed, shot and edited it is a wonder to behold. The effects are also mind-boggling. Some of the up-close shots to various parts of people's bodies have to be seen to be believed.

This is a solid effort. Some might be put off by the fact that it's an entirly Indonesian cast but I hope it doesn't deter possible viewers because they would be missing out on truly great action film. My guess is this will be re-made with an American cast. I would also guess that Gareth Evans is going to get a call from Hollywood that will sizably increase his bank account.",1345766400,2,1879,4.469387755102041

Become a fan of The Lowedown on Facebook:[...]
What's it about?
In the Jakarta slums, a derelict apartment building has become a no-go area - even the police are unwilling to enter. It has become a safe-house for the most dangerous killers and gangsters. A SWAT team infiltrate the building, under the cover of darkness, to remove its owner - a notorious drug lord named Tama.

What did I think?
This was one of the best pure action movies I have seen in a long time.  The fight scenes were so impressive (armed and unarmed), that it has you gripped from start to finish.  If you take ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Expendables"" then put them in a blender...you get ""The Raid: Redemption"".  Stick this one in your player ASAP.",1345680000,2,810,4.676056338028169
2725528,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I'm not sure what I can add to the heaps of praise thrown on this movie. It is one of the best action movies of all time. Evans has a good eye for action, and he showcases several memorable moments in this movie. The machete/wall scene is truly suspenseful. This movie is just plain fun, and that is it's biggest strength.

The Blu-Ray is also great, tons of extras, a very, very informative and entertaining commentary track from Evans, and the option to choose which soundtrack you want to use. The subtitles are given a black border around them and it makes them so much easier to read, especially for someone like me who is a bit color blind, and sometimes has trouble seeing the letters on subtitles as they sometimes blend into lighter backgrounds.",1345680000,2,754,4.5851851851851855

The movie takes all of five minutes to set up, and then BOOM you're in for quite a ride. Cops are drawn into a drug house to take it over and close it down. Trouble is, they're WAAAY outnumbered! Some of the fight scenes in this movie will leave you with your jaw dropped and unable to speak. There's also a nice little plot twist that I'm not going to talk about, but I didn't see it coming. If your needs to make a great action movie are simple, i.e. action, action, and more action, then this is your movie.

Me & my friends was watching this, we didn't even reach for a drink we all was froze in our chairs,just JAW DROPPING AMAZING KICK A** FLICK,WE JUST LOVED IT IN EVERY LEVEL!>> MAKES EXPENDABLES FOR P***IESS!!!

2725532,5,B000M4RG0Q,"""The Raid:  Redemption"" is a much-talked about, highly anticipated movie that did not make it into my part of the region for a theatrical screening!  I suppose the distributors had a rough time when they tried to distribute the movie because:  (a) It was one of the best I've seen this year; (b) it wasn't a stupid, epically boring love story, or (c) it wasn't animated.  Shows you where Hollywood's tastes really are:  in their mouths.

""Raid"" is a non-stop, b*lls-to-the-wall movie encompassing the maelstrom that 20 of the ""best"" cops are thrown into while they try to take over a 30 floor drug empire disguished as a tenament and arrest its sadistic boss.  I was hooked after only five minutes which is basically all the movie takes in trying to deliver any ""warm fuzzies.""  Once the policemen arrive at their location, the viewer is then privy to watching (and even more importantly ENJOYING) one of the best action movies ever made.  You will be left speechless watching some of the fight choreography.

The movie is Indonesian with subtitles, so I'm not going to try to tell you any named actors because, well, I didn't recognize any!  There is a plot twist that I did not anticipate, and that made the movie even more enjoyable.  So, if you like your movies (like I do) to consist of a basic plot, tons of carnage, and LOTS and LOTS of action, this is the movie for you.  It is unrated for lots of violence and language, but, really nothing you've haven't seen in many other movies.  This one is just done WAAAAY better!!

2725533,5,B000M4RG0Q,"I first heard of The Raid: Redemption less than a week ago.  The reviews seemed to be almost all 4-5 stars and the hype was that this was the Action Movie of the Year!  As an action junkie for many years now (my all time favorite movie is ""Die Hard"") I soon became obsessed with the idea of this movie and I just had to see it.  I watched several preview clips on YouTube and I was more than ready to check it out.  Luck would have it we dropped by Best Buy on Saturday and I quickly picked up the Blu ray version.

Well, ""they"" were not kidding!  This is a kick butt film for sure.  I disagree with some reviews that say this movie does not have a plot.  Tons of action for sure, but there is a story behind it all.  I just heard that there are plans for a sequel and even an American version of this film.  I just hope the American verison can come close to the action elements and plot developments of this action classic.  Maybe they can do as good a job as the American version of The Departed.  I certainly plan to watch this movie several times.

The action is brutal, loud, intense, real, relentless, and FAST! But it all fits into the story.  Great lead actor (Iko) and a darn good (make that very good) bad guy henchman called Mad Dog (who also set up all the fight scenes.  Small, but deadly).  I am going to go out and look for other movies by writer/director Gareth Evans and star Iko.  The Special Features are very good as well. I watched the director talk for about 40 minutes on how he put it all together.  And just now a 5-min claymation video called ""Claycat's The Raid"".  I think The Raid: Redemption has all the earmarks of being a cult classic.  Best quote (from the Big Drug Lord to all his gangs): ""Now get to work, and please, enjoy yourself.""",1345334400,3,1769,4.177514792899408
2725534,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Brutal bloody brawling. The the most amazing choreography since Ong Bak. A few reviewers have not truly understood what they're looking at. Many of these stunts have simply never been seen before. The combat imagination at work here is genius. What we have is extraordinarily difficult wireless stunts, and long mise-en-scene action celebration, without the mandatory Hollywood trappings. No love story. No politics. No three act straight jacket. No slow motion eyeball staring... no Matrix imitations.. no standing around waiting for a guy to get up. No faux Jet Li crouched landing poses.

Some cops go to arrest a guy. He resists. Mayhem ensues.

The Blu Ray transfer is beautiful. The sound of the firefights on a powered surround system is absolutely astounding. Revealing behind the scenes extras. A terrific value.

Thank you, Gareth Evans, for the most intense, heart pounding, visceral action fest I've seen in a decade. You've renewed my faith.",1345334400,3,954,5.222222222222222
2725535,5,B000M4RG0Q,"A couple years ago, director Gareth Evans and martial artist Iko Uwais released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merantau/dp/B004326EV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merantau</a>&nbsp;- an impressive project that garnered an overall good response but didn't become as popular as I had hoped it would. Subsequently, I figured that while Iko Uwais might yet become a recognized player in the modern action movie scene, it would take a while for him to do so. Imagine my surprise when ""The Raid"" - his very next movie - began collecting a load of positive reviews on both on this site and others months before its North American release. Imagine my increased surprise when it began building a reputation as the best action movie of the entire decade. While that idea might be presumptive, ""The Raid"" is, without a doubt, a very exciting and deeply satisfying mix of action-thriller and martial arts vehicle, and it's doubtless that at the very least, Iko Uwais is now getting the widespread appreciation he deserves as one of the new top stars.

The story: an Indonesian SWAT team sets out to penetrate the notorious high-rise safe house of a vicious drug lord (Ray Sahetapy), to attempt to capture him. When they're spotted on the fifth level, fifteen floors of thugs and killers are unleashed upon them, requiring the eventual survivors to decide whether to pursue the mission or attempt the equally dangerous in trying to flee.

Perhaps the greatest common complaint I heard regarding ""Merantau"" was that it was a derivative of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak</a>, which was somewhat true. Apparently Gareth Evans acted on these qualms and made ""The Raid"" a decisively more unique vehicle: the plot might make some automatically think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Death/dp/B00005BCKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Death</a>&nbsp;with a police theme, but it's played much more down-to-earth than that. Viewers who are not hooked by action sequences alone might take pleasure in the movie's surprisingly well-defined atmosphere: Evans shows how apt he is at creating tension and suspense in making the desperation of the policemen palpable, particularly through creative audio work and the undeniably creepy setting. It's a thoroughly violent movie, but the atmosphere consistently takes precedence over the bloodletting: at times, it feels less like an action movie and more of a survival thriller. And though it's sort of hard to tell with a foreign language feature, you get the impression that none of the acting performances here are phoned in: Iko Uwais is still portraying the young rookie, but plays a fair hand at intensity, complemented by his in-movie partner Joe Taslim (set to appear in ""The Fast and the Furious 6"").

Of course, for the vast majority of viewers, it's going to be the action content which makes or breaks the movie, and personally, I can't imagine how anyone on earth wouldn't recognize this one's action as top-notch quality. The movie's first 38 minutes are comprised almost entirely of gun-related setups, which are exciting in their own right, but the following 63 minutes proceed to raise the bar of super-violent martial arts choreography. I said it in an earlier review and I'll say it again: the same way Tony Jaa brought international appeal to muay thai, Iko Uwais is making pentjak silat famous onscreen. Whereas ""Merantau"" focused heavily on the empty-handed aspects of the art, ""The Raid"" brings its weapon-related aspects to the forefront, particularly knife-fighting. Jeez, are these fights ever violent: I can't begin to count all of the hapless players who end up getting creatively stabbed, sliced, and split open in the outplay of the lightning-quick choreography. Normally, the fact that there are only four fights would disappoint me, but each of these is so long and creative that I feel satisfied nonetheless. The one-against-many setups of half of the fights helps sell the knifework (realistically, nobody can stand up to a knife assault for very long, so there have to be many opponents at a time for Iko to dice), but the two hand-to-hand oriented ones don't slouch either. Iko's conservative, grounded style is matched by the more kick-filled repertoire of main henchman Yaya Ruhian, making for some incredibly complex and versatile exchanges that undisputedly put the Indonesian film industry on the map as a competitive entity in the action market.

Again, I don't think this is the best action movie of the last ten years, but I do believe that not only has Iko Uwais' sophomore vehicle bested his initial film, it's also topped the latest offerings of Scott Adkins, Van Damme, and just about every other performer of the day. Over a span of eight months and more than seventy other film reviews, this is the first five-star rating I'm giving, and it's a well-deserved one.

2725554,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Many of the reviews were written before the BD even released so figured I would write a review.  First a few key points so you can decide if it is worth your time to keep reading or immediately decide if this movie is not for you.

- EXTREME GORE (Think Saving Private Ryan, then go beyond that)
- Little to no plot (it is a pure action movie)
- The Martial Arts is great, but its NOT a martial arts movie
- It is a foreign film so the English dub is horrible

When I say extreme gore, we are talking brain matter, long vicious cuts and just generally extremely violent scenes.  If this level of violence is beyond your tolerance level than I don't think you will like this movie at all.

If extreme violence does not scare you off than the action in this movie will reward you.  But let's be clear, despite it having an Indonesian martial arts star in it and featuring martial arts this is not a martial arts movie as most view them.  The movie is based on the police raiding a crime lord's apartment building so various forms of weapons are used in this movie so its not all just Silat.  In fact, more people are taken out from guns than from martial arts.  The martial art used in this movie, Silat, is some of the best you will see filmed in a movie.  If you train in martial arts you will instantly recognize many of the attacks you train and drill in, and you will see reversals as good as the attacks.  This movie has a very nice blend of pure action scenes and martial arts scenes so people that typically aren't into martial art movies should like this movie, but since the martial arts in this movie is very good the martial art fans should love it from that point of view.  Best blend of both worlds I've seen.

The English dubbing is dreadful and will make the movie feel off because the voices just don't match.  If you are ok with subtitles than I highly recommend switching to it in the Audio options (called ""Original Music"") and selecting your choice of language subtitles.

The picture quality is very good, it is actually better than most of my Blu-Ray movies.  Though it does look as though it has had some post production editing as it appears a bit unnaturally polished.  I'm guessing this is to smooth out the grainiess most movies have.  I noticed it but honestly it works and I doubt most will even see it.  For a foreign movie the extras on the disc are pretty decent, but it is standard fare for most movies.

My PS3 couldn't play this movie by default - it was at 3.61.  It had a version of 3.65 on the disc, but then it complained I needed to download a newer software version to validate my encryption key. So I downloaded 4.1 from Sony and it worked.  Not sure if dedicated Blu-Ray players will also need to be updated, but I figure it is worth mentioning so anyone thinking of buying this is prepared.

Outside of having to update my PS3 to play the movie, the only other annoyance I had with the Blu-Ray Disc is that in order to skip the commercials, I couldn't simply hit the Title/Pop Up Menu button ...I had to keep hitting the Next Chapter button.  Though since it was general Blu-Ray movies being advertised and movies coming to theaters soon this ""feature"" might affect all Blu-Ray movies.

Overall this is a great movie for anyone looking for a pure adrenalin rush (remember gore disclaimer).  There are other movies to give the mind a work out.  This is the kind of movie you sit with your munchies out and enjoy!",1344988800,5,3454,4.339563862928349

2725556,4,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid: Redemption (Serbuan Maut) is a 2011 Indonesian action/martial arts epic extravaganza that seems to be a feature-length version of the last 40 minutes of John Woo's epic Hard-Boiled. And that's not necessarily a criticism, either. There's no doubt that director Gareth Evans set out to produce a gritty, no-quarter-given 100 minute adrenaline overload of action mayhem, and too his credit he was able to make an engaging and great-looking movie in an extremely limited environment with an even more limited budget.

The plot, rather unsurprisingly, is inconsequential. That is to say, there is just enough storyline to keep things moving along briskly. Iko Uwais stars as Rama, a rookie officer on a Jakarta SWAT team, with a pregnant wife at home.... and, save for a somewhat conventional reveal that comes about halfway through the movie, that's pretty much all the character development and definition you're going to get in this movie. Uwais is a strong screen presence and, even more effectively, an incredibly kinetic martial artist in the Pencak Silat discipline. Along with the rest of a 20-member SWAT team, he is ordered to raid a slum tenement -- a known haven for criminals, killers, drug pushers, and the like -- in order to eliminate a drug lord known as Tama Riyadi. Who ordered the raid and why? These questions drive the story, which takes a turn for the insanely suspenseful when the SWAT team is pinned down and trapped inside the building, with no backup coming, no outgoing communication, and, even worse, nobody knowing they are there in the first place. If that wasn't bad enough, Tama gets on the intercom and announces to all the building's residents that whomever kills a police officer gets free rent for life. The cops suddenly become the hunted, with no place to hide and legions of hardcore killers gunning for bear.

This is all set up in the first fifteen minutes. The remaining 80 feature any manner of violence, action, gore, depravity, you name it, as the surviving officers try to find some way -- ANY way -- to escape the building. All of it is excellently staged and shot, including some of the most exciting martial arts sequences that -- while FAR from realistic -- avoid much of the 90s/00s genre cliches (slow-mo, wire-fu, etc.) and coast by on sheer brutality. We're talking spine-snapping, bone-crunching, neck-twisting, limb-rendering goodness. You know... for kids!

The Raid: Redemption is an unapologetically violent action film, and on that level it is quite superlative. If you want character development, plot complexity, or nuance of any kind, you're best served elsewhere. Is there enough plot to keep things from being little more than a stylistic exercise? Surely, but without the insanely watchable battle sequences -- including a ridiculously incredible 3-way fight sequence between Uwais, Donny Alamsyah, and Yayan Ruhian, the latter of whom playing a brutal yet somehow honorable thug called ""Mad Dog"" and providing the movie's most memorable character -- there would be no other reason for The Raid: Redemption to exist. Yet as a sheer adrenalin blast of gleeful kineticism, this movie excels in abundance.",1344988800,,3175,5.078544061302682
2725557,5,B000M4RG0Q,"What can I say about this film that others have not already expounded on?  No real plot, no character development, no budget.

The intent was to entertain and to be remembered for balls-to-the-wall action.  In this, we have success!  Gareth Evans has created a claustrophobic action masterpiece with intelligent characters, amazing action choreography, and intense atmosphere.  These are the selling points, and the film lives up to each of them beautifully!

Action lovers must see this.  Horror fans could see this too, as there are some very tense scenes that feel like they were picked out of a horror film.  Martial arts fans, absolutely see this.

Writer/Director Gareth Evans does a great job of providing us with numerous action scenes of ballistic intensity. Whether it's machine guns or knives or when things go hand to hand, we get treated to some crazy and kinetic action that's back to basics, balls to the wall, kick ass style. No John Woo glossiness here (Not that there's anything wrong with that. Love JohnWoo). It's just blood soaked and tooth and nail. It's like a Shaw Borthers movie on crack...and lots of it. The Indonesian fighting style adds a uniqueness to the fights and Evans' camera captures all the rapid fire moves of his martial arts savvy cast. And best of all, Evans also knows to back up his action with some good suspense, some strong drama and a few nice plot twists along the way. He also knows to let us catch our breath now and then so we are ready and waiting for the next life and death struggle. And we get plenty of those. Sure there are some flaws and it is vicious and brutally violent but, it also is an entertaining and exhilarating action crime thriller.",1344902400,,1360,4.487903225806452
2725560,5,B000M4RG0Q,"PG-13 action movies can GO TO HELL because THIS is the way they are meant to be made. Firstly, the plot isn't really original or complex but that doesn't matter because the action is soo well done with gun battles, knife fights and martial arts. Secondly, it's relentlessly gory which makes a nice change from the kiddie action flicks we've been subjected to after the glory days of 1980's action cinema. Thirdly, I just bought The Raid, Total Recall Special Edition and Death Wish 3 on Blu-ray today so I'm in hog heaven. YAY ME!

I'd like to stress that a movie like The Raid, one that only cost ONE MILLION DOLLARS to make, is important especially in light of the 200 million dollar PG-13 Total Recall remake that TANKED HARD at the box office and rightfully so. You don't need to spend insane amounts of money to make an action flick these days what with digital technology being what it is. The Raid was shot on HD and it looks FANTASTIC! Also, you might not know it but this movie has a lot of handheld camera work but unlike the strobing ""shakey cam"" crap that we've endured in 99% of all action movies made since Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator used it, The Raid uses handheld photography the proper way to create a sense of kinetic action without giving me a headache.

There's not much more to say about this glorious movie as it is now my third favorite action flick of all time after Jackie Chan's Police Story and John Woo's Hard Boiled. Oh and I would like to add that if you enjoy The Raid and are a gamer then I would highly recommend Max Payne 3 which is the greatest action game ever made.

That is all....",1344902400,,1626,4.395348837209302
2725561,1,B000M4RG0Q,"That is quite an accomplishment. The movie was the lousiest martial arts demonstration I'd ever seen. You will cringe as you see opponents appearing on cue to get beat up in awfully staged scenes. The plot, if there was one, is extremely contrived and unbelievable. The SWAT team in this movie is officially the world's worst. I mean, really, they had no backup? This movie has been massively overhyped and overrated on the web, and I find it all very dubious indeed.

Supposedly, there are plans to do an American remake. I really hope this doesn't happen, as this, the original film, was just terrible to begin with. There's a reason the film did not get wide distribution.

This may be great for young teens interested in mindless cartoon action, but for adults, 20 minutes may be all that they can stand.

Also, does anyone know what the Redemption part had to do with the movie? Way to pretentiously add it on to the American version!!!",1344902400,11,941,4.656626506024097
2725572,4,B000M4RG0Q,"This martial arts import from Indonesia is guaranteed to satisfy those who enjoy a good knuckle crunching, knife slashing, body tossing, blood spurting adrenalin rush.  The plot as it were, involves a 20 man S.W.A.T. team in Jakarta who has a covert mission to take out a narcotics cartel located in a rundown tenement high rise.  It doesn't go well as the drug boss has a man on the inside and has anticipated the raid.

What follows is the violent exchange between the good guys and the bad guys and it lasts about 95 minutes once they get going.  Every conceivable object is used as a weapon ranging from automatic rifles to light bulbs.  In many respects, the film is nothing new.  Grunts and groans with every punch permeate the film from beginning to end.  The bad guys usually only attack one at a time rather than in swarms.  And when they have the numbers advantage they don't have guns.

Yet, some of this can be forgiven as the quarters are tight, usually in hallways.  The actors involved are also pretty good.  They seem believable.  Sure they are strong and tough but they also fear the unknown and the consequences.  I'm not saying see the film for the acting, but hey it's something different.  The filmmaking itself is also first rate.  Welsh director Gareth Evans knows what he's doing and the fight choreography and stunts are as good as you'll see.  I'm guessing the medical tent on the set was pretty full most of the time.

This Blu ray transfer comes in with a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Frankly it is a bit disappointing watched on my screen.  Even with the stark, dark photograpy the picture doesn't have much life to it.  There a bland texture on both the exterior and interior scenes.  The color is washed out.  I didn't see this in a theater so it's hard to determine if this should have been expected.  The audio is a bit better with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track in both English and Indonesian.  While not perfect, the bullets do seem to be coming from everywhere and the music is clear and defined.  Viewers can also choose from 2 different music tracks while watching the film which is a bit unusual.",1344729600,,2152,4.541666666666667

2725586,2,B000M4RG0Q,"Synopsis: a group of SWAT-like cops in Indonesia go into a multistoried tenement in order to capture a drug lord, living near the top floor. The drug lord is played by veteran actor Ray Sahetapy, nowadays looking nothing like his former handsome self. The building has more criminals living there than an American HUD housing project. A third of the way up, surprise is lost. The drug lord, who has cameras and speakers in every floor, invites everyone to take out the intruders whereupon a slaughter begins with automatic weapons, knives, machetes, etc. The cops are rapidly eliminated except for a handful, who cannot call for backup and who run out of ammunition, at which point it's martial arts time, as they try to extricate themselves out of the trap. The violence is nonstop. There is little characterization and the film is just a vehicle for martial arts. I have to admit that most of the fights are pretty stimulating and somewhat believable. Until near the end, there is one long, long, long, LONG scene where nonstop assaults take place (I went out for popcorn, bored, came back, and it was still going on). After sustaining all this damage, the protagonists just simply walk out of the room.

Aside from the fact that it was filmed with the technical expertise that Indonesian film industry usually lacks (although they have some very good, overlooked, actors and actresses), mainly due to the writer/director being Gareth Evans, I really don't see why it had so many good reviews in the US.

Like others have mentioned there's not much of a plot, but with this kind of action movie you really don't need one. There is a couple of surprises though. There's gunfights and other weaponry that makes this movie more exciting also. I really thought that the music score went perfectly with the action.  I have to say this has to be the best martial art action movie I have ever seen and that's probably why I have seen it in the theater about - well, I lost count after 5 times!

2725589,5,B000M4RG0Q,"The Raid is an Indonesian action flick where the title of the movie sums up what happens, a raid. Sound's lame because there isn't much story/character? That's what that old fart Ebert thought too, however I liked how the Raid skims over it's story and goes to the action, because when you pay for your ticket to see The Raid: Redemption, are you paying to see some unnecessary padding for an action movie where a guy crys about the meaning of life, or are you paying for psychotic Asian dudes screaming and beating the living s*** out of each other? Ebert should stick to the Human Centipede 2 and let action fans that actually enjoy this genre judge this film on it's own merits.

So for a second in the opening you see this guy with his pregnant wife, and start thinking to yourself ""wtf is this boring tripe?"", and that's basically the director giving you a minute to find your seats and start munching on popcorn before suddenly we see a group of SWAT guys driving to a huge apartment complex while being briefed on their mission: take out the drug lord. Once they break in using realistic tactics the s*** hits the fan in the best way possible and the rest of the movie for me was a blur of ass kicking.

The stunts and the choreography are incredible, the fights and the tactics all have an inventive wit to them to keep the whole story interesting, at no point in the movie did I go ""that's stupid and unrealistic"". The weapons used range from machetes to assault rifles, and they're all used (well the sniper rifles were a bit underutilized) in even more frantic fights. When the movie isn't a bunch of guys kicking each others asses it's the remaining SWAT members laying low and assessing the situation, still keeping the film entertaining without being mindnumbing.

The moment when I went ""holy s*** this is badass"" was when a guy has a fluorescent light rod stuck in his neck and is still beating up two guys at the same time, jesus christ just thinking about this movie again is giving me a stiffy.

Also it looks like a Hollywood remake is in the works, I'm surpised they haven't announced yet the inevitable remake of the US remake.",1340236800,,2149,4.5025641025641026
2725590,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Writer/Director Gareth Evans learned his lesson from MERANTAU, his earlier collaboration with former truck driver and now budding martial arts star Iko Uwais. MERANTAU exhibited some first-rate martial arts mayhem but was crippled by Evans' meandering pace and flat explorations of the lead character's culture. In THE RAID: REDEMPTION (or ""Serbuan maut"") Evans sets us up with everything we need to know about premise and characters within the first five minutes. From then on, brother, it's best that you grab hold of something. Nerves will be jangled and eyes glued and behinds parked precariously on the edges of seats.

Sub-text and this film go together like Merchant Ivory cinema and Uwe Boll. And yet, sometimes, there's something to be said for guerrilla filmmaking. THE RAID: REDEMPTION is strictly no frills, production values-wise. But Gareth Evans makes the most of his shoestring budget and minimalist plot. He turns the focus on the action sequences. You know how, in martial arts films, the plot merely serves as a framing device for the fighty fights? Here, the plot makes a cameo appearance and then gets the ef out of Dodge lest it catch a vicious Iko Uwais boot to the head.

In the slums of Jakarta looms a squalid 30-story highrise, an apartment complex which the vile ganglord, Tama Rivadi, rents out to assassins, psychopaths, gangsters, and drvg traffickers. Tama's impenetrable sanctuary has long been regarded as a ""no-go zone"" for the police. Until today. Today an elite squad composed of twenty police officers has just gotten the go-ahead to infiltrate Tama's fortress and capture Tama himself. What are the odds they could do this on the Q?

The squad manages to systematically secure only the first few bottom floors before the cat is let out the bag. From then on, it's an apocalyptic fight for survival. There's a twofer in this one: RAID: THE REDEMPTION is most recognizably a martial arts film, but there are elements of the survival horror genre peppered in. Tama Rivadi is quick to offer lifelong tenancy to them residents what take out the coppers.

Get your raw thrills, get your jaw dropped. Gareth Evans and Iko Uwais have created something primal here, and credit Evans, too, for establishing an oppressive atmosphere. I would not want to be caught in that lethal tenement, with homicidal maniacs swarming up on me. THE RAID: REDEMPTION is an Indonesian film (with English sub-titles) and, as such, it gleefully showcases the nation's traditional martial arts discipline, Pencak Silat. What Evans constructs with the action sequences is stunning. He adeptly stages the tense gunplays. But when the ammo runs out and the firearms discarded, what's left is intense, close-quarters, I can smell your breath, hand-to-hand combat, and that's when the film achieves another level of excitement. Evans applies deft camera work to capture the speed, grace and brutality of Pencak Silat. Iko Uwais plays the unassuming rookie cop, Rama, who only wants to survive the mission and return to his pregnant wife. Uwais demonstrates a quiet appeal; he's certainly got more of an acting presence than Tony Jaa. And Iko Uwais in motion is something to behold. I'd put his electrifying marathon hallway fight and, later, his extended brawl with the machete gang against any other fight scenes captured on film. Uwais and Yayan Ruhian - who plays Tama's vicious lieutenant ""Mad Dog"" - choreographed the fights, and what they've come up with is UNREAL!

And just when you think the film's action couldn't top itself, it does. I don't know if these fighty fights are that original or inventive, but, damn, they're executed with such verve and swagger and shot with such clarity that they deserve all the plaudits and hyperbole. The pulsating score only punctuates the electrifying symphony of violence. I won't go too much into my favorite kill, only that it involves the jagged remains of a door and that one baddie gets rudely introduced to that.

The pace blisters. Even the quieter moments are laced with nervous anxiety. There's enough ""acting"" done that you do end up caring about certain characters and what befalls them. Ray Sahetapy nails it as the deliciously malevolent ganglord Tama. Joe Taslim lends solid presence as the experienced Sergeant Jaka, one of my favorite characters in the film. THE RAID: REDEMPTION won't escape comparisons to ONG BAK and DISTRICT B13, and that's fine. Moment for moment, in terms of relentless pace and sustained suspense, RAID is superior to those other two, especially ONG BAK. Is Tony Jaa still a hermit in the woods? Can he still handle a goon so that the poor bastard goes hurtling backwards on a trajectory across empty space and nearly cracks in half against a lower railing? Iko Uwais just did that.

Ear to the ground news is that there's already a sequel in the works. I'm not sure how Iko Uwais plans to top this film without setting himself on fire. Niche market, my butt. Even the more sophisticated crowds owe it to themselves to see this one. After all, THE RAID: REDEMPTION is an independent foreign movie. It's practically Merchant Ivory.

2725591,5,B000M4RG0Q,"Here's some fun math for you...This entire film cost as much to make as ~52 seconds of Transformers 3.  I'll say that again.  For the same price, you could make either a) the best action flick since John Woo's Hong Kong masterpieces, or b) 52 seconds of bloated PG13 mediocrity.  Stunning.

In any case, the second collaboration between Gareth Evans, Iko Uwais, and Yayan Ruhian demonstrates just how far you can take the form.  The plot is simple and straightforward, and set up with incredible economy.  A few carefully edited scenes and a smattering of dialogue puts all the pieces in place, then it's 90-odd minutes of exquisitely crafted mayhem.

Technically, the film is very well shot.  The camera work is both fluid and at times surprisingly creative (they pull off a great drop-down shot early on using one camera but two cameramen).  Most importantly though, it's choreographed into the action itself.  The camera is the 3rd (or 4th or 10th) player in the fight scenes, moving with the actors to give the audience a clear view of the lightning fast techniques while highlighting the incredibly kinetic nature of the fights themselves.  And kinetic is the only way to describe the fighting.  The choreography in The Raid is the some of the most aggressive I've ever seen.  There's no dancing around, no sizing each other up, no slow-mo, and definitely no waiting around for a downed opponent to regain his feet so the fight can continue.  The actors go after each other like their lives really are at stake, attacking relentlessly from whatever position they find themselves in, using whatever weapon is available.  Silat (the primary martial art on display here) is a viciously practical close-quarters system, and it's full range of open-handed combination strikes, knees, elbows, and grappling techniques is on full display; along with some knife-work that's almost too fast to keep track of.

This is a particular treat for martial arts fans who have seen a lot of Karate, Kung Fu, or Muay Thai films.  The mobility and variety of attack angles employed by Silat fighters is distinct and makes the already aggressive choreography doubly unpredictable.  These guys never stop moving.  The stunt work is top notch, and you really get a feeling throughout the movie that these guys are hungry for it.  This is their big shot to bring Indonesian martial arts to a western audience, and they pull out all the stop to make it happen.  While the level of violence has been criticized by some as being gratuitous and misanthropic, what I see is an incredibly driven crew of young, talented Indonesians going balls-out to earn their indigenous martial art a permanent place in the genre canon.  As far as I'm concerned, they succeed and then some.

One final thing that sets The Raid apart from most other martial arts flicks is the weird but successful blending with the survival-horror genre.  In between fights, Evans ratchets up the tension as the dwindling number of survivors try to evade roving bands of bloodthirsty killers.  This alternation between tension building stealth and explosive action keeps you on the edge of your seat pretty much the entire time.  It's a very smart way to do things, and avoids the usual curse of foot-taping ""I'm bored, when's the next fight"" the plagues a lot of genre films.  Not that there's any shortage of fight scenes.  I can think of plenty of martial arts movies for which the climactic showdown was less exciting than every single action sequence in The Raid.

Anyway, I've gone on long enough.  This is the new high water mark for pure, unadulterated martial-arts mayhem.  I can't wait to see what these guys come up with next.",1339286400,128,3681,4.869774919614148
