8278957,3,B001AQZRX8,"I love Gamera - but I would NOT watch it without MST3K (ie MST3k Vs Gamera box set - I wish they did all the movies, even the more recent/darker ones - which would be perfect for Rifftrax if you ask  me) This isn't bootleg becuase it's a public domain movie. Anyone can do anything with it. Evlria has two DVD versions aswell. Something tells me this was either a huge gamera fan that didn't like their movie being messed with (but really, isn't this the one thast ALL comprised OLD footage from the other Gamera films?? or am I thinking of something less) OR a Shout! Factory representative trying to sell their product an discredit this one. Could be wrong though - and don't get me wrong I love Shout! Factory - they've done fantastic things for MST3k.

Sorry to Lobo and Cinema Insomnia that people jump to conclusions like this, and Im sorry I had to post a review without first seeing the film itself. I plan on watching all the CI I can get my hands on.",1371859200,,960,4.3277777777777775

8278960,5,B001AQZRX8,"This is a hilarious and fun edition of ""Gamera Super Monster"" as shown on TV's ""Cinema Insomnia"", hosted by America's finest contemporary horror host, Mr. Lobo, who provides witty commentary and bizarre factoids throughout. An earlier reviewer apparently did not understand this, so be prepared for some amusing hosting segments and video strangeness along with your feature presentation. Lobo does fine and funny work on the ""Cinema Insomnia"" series, proudly carrying on the horror host tradition of Bob Wilkins, Ghoulardi, the Cool Ghoul, Zacherle, Dr. San Guinary, Elvira and so many others, and his contributions here make the otherwise-dubious film a lot more fun. Highly recommended for late-nite horror fans and the people who love them.",1223769600,6,744,5.422413793103448
8278961,1,B001AQZRX8,"Greetings,

I really hesitate to give harsh reviews, but this is without one of the worst DVD's I have ever purchased. I only gave it 1 star because Amazons rating system demand that I do, when in actualty it deserves NO STARS. And I'm not talking about the film. I knew going in that Gamera-Super Monster was one of the worst Kaiju (Giant Monster) films ever made as I had seen it several times as a child, however this DVD makes what I thought might be an entertaining movie for my children, unwatchable. Mr. Lobo is a sad attempt to recreate the glory days of Creature Features (Bob Wilkins), but fails miserably at doing so. Instead the movie is hacked up and this guy appears every 5-10 minuets with asinine commentary and factoids about the film. Also the film is loaded with ads for websites were bootleg DVD's of ""public domain"" horror & sci-fi films are cheaply made and sold. Thankfully this movie is out of stock (as of 09/10/2008), but if Amazon gets more in DO NOT BUY IT! Make my $20 the last money these people get. With DVD's becoming cheaper to produce and more & more material becoming available all the time, I would be willing to wait until the rights to the ""Showa"" Gamera films (The original 8 films produced from 1965-1980)are picked up by a legitimate video distributor and are relesed perhaps in a nice box set as in Japan. ONce again DO NOT BUY THIS Please!!!",1221004800,7,1385,4.496031746031746
