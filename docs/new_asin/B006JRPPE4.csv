8499793,5,B006JRPPE4,Beautiful poetry and music from Persia's ancient days. I received good insights into this oldest of Persian customs and hearing the poetry in both Persian and English was wonderful! I bought a second copy for a friend!,1327881600,,218,4.918918918918919
8499794,5,B006JRPPE4,"Ms. Talebi has eloquently captured the essence of Norouz, the Persian New Year festival. This is particularly worthy of applause since it was rendered in English with occasional Persian words thrown in at opportune moments demonstrating, among other things, the parallels between Norouz and Spring Equinox. Her erudite yet amusing writing is matched only by her spirited delivery which is in keeping with a fine tradition of story-telling in our culture. This multimedia performace included Ms. Talebi's monologue, a trio of expert musicians with mostly original music, and a lovely slide show. The well-researched prose in combination with her unique point of view was fresh, evocative, entertaining and dare I say educational. I was privileged to be present at a live performance in Orange County and witnessed the audience of several hundreds mesmerized from the beginning to the end. I spoke to Persians who were lining up to purchase her autographed DVDs after the performance.  They claimed to have learnt a few new things about Norouz themselves. Finally, the DVD A/V quality and packaging was excellent.  I look forward to Ms. Talebi's next work!",1323734400,,1154,5.266304347826087
8499795,5,B006JRPPE4,I first saw it (live) at the Norooz celebrations at LACMA held by Farhang Foundation.  I couldn't wait to share what I saw and heard with my son and other loved ones.  Very shortly after the DVD was released I managed to grab a copy and all I can tell you is that that was not the only copy I bought!  The DVD is very nicely put together and clearly shows Ms. Talebi's extraordinary command of both languages and her amazing ability to transform abstract and poetic concepts into an easy to understand performance.  Mr. Salehi's music is beautifully intertwined with Ms. Talebi's words and the result is nothing short of a magical performance video.  I highly recommend this jewel to any body who wishes to learn and cherish one of the main aspects of an ancient culture.  Bravo Ms. Talebi and Mr. Salehi.  Looking for more collaborations between the two artists.,1323475200,,863,4.6381578947368425
8499796,5,B006JRPPE4,"In The Persian Rite of Spring, Niloofar Talebi, the talented narrator of this poignant monologue, takes the viewer through a flawless bi-lingual delivery of the story of NoRooz, with a musical accompaniment that stirs the soul.  The tale culminates in crescendo that is the enactment of the Vernal Equinox: the moment of the Persian New Year.

Niloofar Talebi builds to the moment, which she counts down with the help of an engaged live audience, with a passionate tale of the civilization that gave birth to the celebration of No Rooz. She movingly recounts the tales of history, wrought from a rich tradition that established NoRooz as the annual celebration of the Persian people, marking a ""New Day"" at the start of Spring as the symbol of their new year. She weaves in tales of Ahura Mazda and Zoroaster, and mentions the boundless contributions of our rich Persian culture to the arts, science, mathematics, psychology, physics and more.

Created by Niloufar Talebi with music composer by Bobak Salehi, The Persian Rite of Spring brings to life a tradition that is largely unknown to a world that is keen to understand the Persian culture better. It is a  parable that intermingles mythology, poetry, music and folklore, to culminate in a celebration that is shared by people across parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, the Caucasus, Crimea and some parts of the Balkans - all of which were part of the mighty Persian Empire.",1323475200,,1449,4.950617283950617
8499797,5,B006JRPPE4,"This DVD simply takes you on a journey of mythology, poetry and history of Norouz, Persian Rite of Spring, through the artistic talent of Miss Niloufar Talebi. Truly a masterpiece live @ L.A.C.M.A.(Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art) and on DVD!!!",1323388800,,251,5.146341463414634
8499798,5,B006JRPPE4,"I saw this show in February 2010 at the Farhang Foundation, it is a unique masterpiece that blends mythology, poetry and the magics of Nowrooz in a powerful setting. It is a must for second generation iranians looking to learn more about the ritual and traditions of their ancestry and it is also well suited for anyone who wishes to learn more about nowrooz.",1323388800,,359,4.625
8499799,5,B006JRPPE4,"I have owned this DVD now for about a year and have watched it many times.  It's a very unique and new look about all the Iranian traditions we all celebrate and yet know almost nothing about their origins. I have shared this DVD with my friends and family.  My daughter, who was born in the US and doesn't get to see all the activities as we did growing up, really enjoyed the story line.  It is narrated in both Farsi and English so it is easy for everyone to understand.  I highly recommend this DVD for its entertaining and educational value.",1323388800,,546,4.323529411764706
