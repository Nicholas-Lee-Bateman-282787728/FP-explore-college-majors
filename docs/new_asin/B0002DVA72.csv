Lenny Macgill draws this video out way beyond it`s necessary time by playing stupid and then coming on as more knowledgable than the co-instructor. As one reviewer put it ..... ""It is really dumbed down.""  That is an understatement! Watching Lenny sight-in his rifle at the range is 5 minutes of information stretched out for the length of the video. After watching it, I wondered how many other people have been had ... like me??? I consider my DVD copy to be a worthless piece of plastic that I am hoping to re-sell for maybe the price of a box of 22LR ammunition. Save your money and spend your time doing anything else ... This video is a waste!

8027042,3,B0002DVA72,"The video has some good basic information on how to mount a scope, use a bore sighter, breaking in a new barrel, and finally sighting the rifle in on the range.  The information is basic (assumes the shooter knows little).  The video does NOT cover selection of scope, scope mounts, or any other equipment.

The video is unnecessarily long and could easily be compressed into 30 minutes.  For example, the break-in procedure demonstrated consists of firing one shot, running 20 patches of JB, and two patches of solvent.  You repeat this procedure after the first 10 shots.  Not only do get to watch Magill run through this procedure once, they included portions of him doing it after each shot.

Contrary to the description (which is also on the DVD case), Magill only sights out to 400 yards -- not 800.",1270425600,,805,4.707142857142857
8027043,4,B0002DVA72,"Definitely a good video for long range precision shooting, especially if you are just starting out. They really ""dumb it down"" in my opinion. It's not exactly professional quality, but I still recommend it.",1268352000,,206,5.088235294117647
