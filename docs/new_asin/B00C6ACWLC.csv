5691538,3,B00C6ACWLC,"No matter if you're watching classic Doctor Who or the very latest season, it's always an adventure. Some of the best episodes feature those villains we just love to hate! ""The Moonbase"", a story starring the Second Doctor, played by Patrick Troughton, features one of the most popular ""baddies"" in the history of the series -- the Cybermen! As chilling as they are in the contemporary series', they are even more so in this story. Even though the costumes were altered from the original Cybermen of ""The Tenth Planet"" 1966, the Cybermen still have that human look to them which makes them so frightening.

Since the original audio is all that exists of the first and third episodes, the audio was remastered and the lost episodes were animated for this DVD. Unlike the previous classic Doctor Who DVD (reviewed HERE), ""The Ice Warriors"", the animation was very well done -- no more one-dimensional ""paperdoll"" characters here. The audio was a bit garbled at times, but I don't think it was due to a poor remastering rather the robotic speech of the Cybermen which is difficult to understand. Although the story itself isn't quite as suspenseful as previous episodes of the classic series, there is still a lot to enjoy. Even with the little hitches in the audio and the story, if you're missing the onscreen dynamics of two companions that we saw with Amy and Rory in series' 5-7 of the reboot, you'll love Polly, Jamie, and Ben fighting alongside the Doctor and what's left of the Moonbase crew to defeat the Cybermen threat.

When all is said and done, while not my favorite Doctor Who story, I still believe it is a must have for any Whovian's collection. The Cybermen are simply put, cool villains, and are a formidable opponent for the Doctor and his gang. It's easy to see why the writers of new Doctor Who have brought the Cybermen back to the new series. Doctor Who: The Moonbase is a good way to pass the time until Series 8!

5691539,1,B00C6ACWLC,"The Moonbase is a great Doctor Who story featuring the first return of the Cybermen after the famous first regeneration story, The Tenth Planet. Furthermore, the restoration is great, and the animation for the missing episodes is the best yet from Planet 55.

But this American release is a total disappointment.

When Spearhead From Space was released on Blu-ray in the US, the story was slowed down so that it could be presented at 24p (as the US Blu-ray standard has no 25p or 50i setting), and without interlacing and pulldown, as is normally the case with all PAL-to-NTSC transfers. Now, The Moonbase has gotten similar treatment, even though US DVDs will always have interlacing and pulldown, since it was designed for standard definition TVs. While this would have been a good idea for the Paul McGann movie (which was sped-up for its UK DVD release, and stayed as such for the US DVD), it's uncalled for here with a set of episodes shot at 25 frames a second. If you don't have access to a region-free DVD player, stick with Lost in Time until Warner Bros. and the BBC fix this improperly mastered DVD.",1392076800,12,1110,4.687179487179487
5691540,5,B00C6ACWLC,"The Doctor is supposed to be taking Jamie and Polly to Mars, but instead they land in 2070 on the moon. (Remember, the TARDIS may not take the Doctor where he wants to go, but she always takes him where he needs to go.) They don their spacesuits and Jamie's larking ends up with him concussed. Fortunately, they're taken in at the Moonbase, and Jamie is settled into the sick bay.

The Moonbase has an international crew of 19 scientists; their job is to run and maintain the Gravitron. By controlling the Earth's tides, they control Earth's weather.

But all is not well at the Moonbase. Crewmen have been falling ill with a mysterious virus. Secondly, a communications expert says that ""Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every word we say."" And on top of that, the leader, Hobson, reports that ""There were two more of those momentary drops in air pressure while I was on.""

This makes the scientists naturally suspicious when the Doctor turns up, especially when crew start vanishing from the sick bay. Polly returns to the sick bay to nurse Jamie there, when she lets loose a scream. She thought she saw a Cyberman. But that couldn't be - they were destroyed in ""The Tenth Planet"" series, right?  HAH

The transformation of man into Cyberman in ""The Moonbase"" reminds me of how the Borg inject and transform men in the  ""Star Trek: First Contact"" movie. (sidebar: Borg Queen, best bad guy EVER.)

The black & white ""The Moonbase"" first aired Feb./March 1967, in 4 episodes of 25 minutes each. This is a review for the February 2014 one-disc DVD release.

This series was previously released on DVD as part of the 2004 ""Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes: The Patrick Troughton Years"" set with pretty much no restoration.  Video has survived for only two episodes of ""The Moonbase"", #2 and #4. Thanks to fans, though, recorded audio for episodes #1 and #3 have survived. In ""Lost in Time"", episodes #1 and #3 were presented in audio only (not even snapshots were used), so it is like listening to the radio.

For this 2014 DVD, however, episodes #1 and #3 are presented in animation synched to the recordings. The two missing episodes are animated by Planet 55 Studios, who also animated ""The Tenth Planet"" (episode 4) and ""The Reign of Terror"" (episode 4 & 5). I have really liked Planet 55's animation style.
[Added after my DVD was received and watched] I really liked the animation for the two ""The Moonbase"" episodes. Another excellent series by Planet 55.

When the new episodes were discovered, they were immediately published on itunes. BBC had already cleaned up ""The Moonbase"" before it went to itunes, but itunes cannot support the VidFIRED result (I do not know enough about it to be more exact.) The DVD, however, was supposed to show the newly cleaned up VidFIRED episodes. Unfortunately, a mastering error resulted in the DVD version being the same non-vidFIRED version as is available on itunes. I understand the pain of the reviewers enraged by this, but as a non-technophile, I can genuinely write that I wasn't bothered at all while viewing the DVD. [However, I should mention that we do not have a super-large TV.]

According to the BBC, the sound (4 episodes) has been digitally remastered. [See other reviews concerning how sound had to be slightly corrected due to the DVD mastering error.]  All episodes are available with English subtitles.

DVD Bonus Extras::
The Audio Commentary is extra #4, but I want to cover it first. In a departure from previous DVD releases, ""The Moonbase"" animated episodes also have commentary.
Once again, Toby Hadoke moderates. This time, the commentators have fun trying to trip him up. Is there anything he doesn't know about Doctor Who? Commentators include Innes Lloyd (from a 1966 interview), Toby Hadoke's interviews with Carol Topolski and Lucy Pedler (Kit Pedler's daughters), Edward Phillips (plays Bob, a moonbase scientist), Anneke Wills (plays Polly), Brian Hodgson (sound designer) and Frazer Hines (plays Jamie), and Toby Hadoke's interviews with Lovett Bickford (assistant floor manager, who later directed ""The Leisure Hive"" series), Derek Chafer (extra, plays Cyberman), Barry Noble (plays Cyberman) and Reg Whitehead (plays a Cyberman, and was the very first Cyberman in ""The Tenth Planet""). Also there's an excerpt recording of Peter Hawkins (voice of the Cybermen) from a convention.
Dr. Christopher Magnus Howard Pedler, known as Kit, was brought in to lend ""scientific rigor"". He wrote three scripts for Dr Who, all having Cybermen: ""The Tenth Planet"", ""The Moonbase"" and ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"". This is not happenstance. As Carol notes, her father ""had a genuine concern, particularly about ... social irresponsibility in science."" A man of many parts, ""he once built a nuclear bomb in the garage of the townhouse. As you do!. Because he wanted to prove that you could [that the information was readily available].""
The Cybermen costumes had always been uncomfortable. As Chafer notes, ""The first ones were the worst ones, when they had the stocking masks. And the falling over! The front pack they wore was too heavy."" The second costumes, for ""The Moonbase"", were not much better: ""On the set, the heat was fantastic. I've actually seen steam coming out of the eyeholes.""
Hadoke to Whitehead: ""Does it crop up? Do you still have to say to people occasionally, 'I was the first Cyberman'?""
Whitehead: ""It's something which I don't bring up too often, mainly because I have a wife who's so bored with anything about Cybermen. An incredible number of people come up to me... who are amazed that I was one.""

1.  ""Lunar Landing: Making The Moonbase"" (44 minutes) Commentators include Anneke Wills, Reg Whitehead, Frazer Hines, Desmond McCarthy (production assistant). Anneke says, ""I actually liked [the look of] the original Cybermen... They weren't far removed from the human being,"" which made them more of a warning of what science may wrought.
2.  Photo Gallery. All B&W with appropriate Cybermen music in the background.
3.  PDF Materials. Put the disc in your computer to see the Radio Times Listing.
4.  Audio Options - Commentary
5.  Info Text. Info Text is available only on the non-animated episodes, numbers 2 & 4. Always interesting. ""The hinged Cyber-mouthpiece was wired to the actor's jaw, so he could operate it by opening his own mouth, if he remembered to do so, of course....""  Watch for when the actor forgets!
Uncredited extras who played Cybermen included John Levene, who later played Sergeant Benton of UNIT.
6.  Coming Soon. This is a trailer for the DVD release of ""The Underwater Menace"". This 4-episode Patrick Troughton series originally aired right before ""The Moonbase"". Original video is missing for episodes 1 & 4.

Hopefully soon this dvd will be released. This of course features the Cybermen(one of my personal fav monsters, up there w/the Ice Warriors)I just loved the way THe Cybermen did their plotting in Troughtons time, it seemed to lose something as the years went by.

5691555,5,B00C6ACWLC,"Don't let the fact that episodes 1 & 3 are animated scare you off this wonderful story. The sound track is original and the animation is very well done and that combination allows for a ""missing"" Troughton story to be seen once again.

A few of points on the DVD compilation itself:
1. There are no production notes available for the 2 animated episode although they are there for the filmed episodes 2 & 4. I would have liked to have the production notes for the whole story.
2. The commentary tracks are different between the animated and filmed episodes. I found this a bit odd as I would have liked to hear comments from all the individuals involved for each of the episodes.
3. Extras are scarce but there is a 21 minute ""making of"" extra which is decent.

Besides the nitpicking three issues I had with the compilation, it was fantastic to be able to get the whole arc of this story. It was definitely worth getting and I enjoyed much more than I thought I would.

The animation on episodes 1 & 3 was really well done I thought. It didn't really stray at all from what what I saw on the filmed episodes 2 & 4. The characters looked like who they were supposed to be and the backgrounds, props, etc all matched up to the originals on the filmed episodes. I put off getting this story because of the animation but after seeing how it's done, I'm going to get the remainder available that have  animated episodes.",1427846400,7,1416,4.393129770992366

Ben and Polly and Jamie are the companions and of course they are battling the cybermen on a Moon base set in the future of the planet Earth.

5691583,5,B00C6ACWLC,"I just loved this story. There's far too little of the faboo Patrick Troughton around, and he's a marvelous Doctor. His companions sometimes left a little to be desired, but for himself, he owned the part. Here we have a well-developed story (if it's the rather typical pattern of strangers arrive, stuff is going wrong, it must be the strangers, oh crap, it's not the strangers, it's the [insert bug-eyed monster threat], well, it's Doctor Who!)

The animation used to replace the missing portions is superb, and fits nicely into the overall scheme (visually) of the story. It's not the least bit jarring or distracting. I would gladly pay the BBC for all of the missing Doctor Who episodes for which there is original audio if they would entirely animate them in this manner.

The audio tracks exist thanks to fans but these have resorted to a cheap Japanese ""anime"" type of simple animation that is of poor quality. It may be fine for Pokemon fans but it basically sucks. Why can't the BBC hire a decent studio to do the animation? There are parts of the sequences that exist so would it be too hard to splice those in?

5691588,3,B00C6ACWLC,"During the Patrick Troughton era of Doctor Who, the show featured several ""base-under-siege"" stories that involved alien monsters attacking, well, bases. To be honest, I don't like this storytelling formula, or think that it works well for the show. Apart from the fact that it's repetitive, it pretty much guarantees that everyone the Doctor encounters on his travels will be a soldier, scientist or stubborn bureaucrat who's in charge of the base.

That said, ""The Moonbase"" is a pretty good example of a story about, ahem, bases. The obligatory bureaucrat character is one-dimensional, but played by a good actor who does interesting things with the role. Meanwhile, the villainous Cybermen - in only their second appearance - are weirdly sinister and creepy. (I do miss the more human aspects of their Tenth Planet design, though.) Also, Troughton's Doctor really comes into his own in this story; in a great speech, he establishes himself as a crusader against evil who's ready to protect humanity at all costs. Good stuff.

So the story is, for me, a mixed bag. But how about the DVD? Well, since logging onto Amazon I've found out that it's mastered incorrectly, and plays at the wrong speed. To be honest, I didn't notice this problem when I watched it, so I'm wondering how bad it can actually be. (Well, maybe I noticed it on a subliminal level. I did, after all, fall asleep on The Moonbase because it felt slow!)

Setting aside the tech stuff, the DVD is otherwise fairly impressive but unexceptional for the Doctor Who range. The standout feature is that the ""lost"" episodes one and three of this serial are presented in animated form. The animation is pretty great; it makes the Cybermen look extra-creepy, and the likenesses of the actors are captured very well. Other notable features include an okay making-of documentary, an enthusiastic commentary track and the obligatory photo gallery. It's not a bad set of features, exactly, but more popular Doctor Who serials tend to get better treatment on DVD. Between the slightly bare-bones release and the mastering problem, you might want to think twice before you buy this - then again, it might be worth it for the animation alone.",1398643200,5,2197,4.9324324324324325
5691589,4,B00C6ACWLC,"So it's not VIDFIRE'd. I have already seen the remaining episodes several times. The improvement on how washed out they were in the Lost in Time set is amazing. The animation is also quite good. I would have no reason to wait to buy a ""better version.""",1398211200,5,252,4.382978723404255
5691600,3,B00C6ACWLC,"If you're interested in only a good 1960s Doctor Who story, then this is certainly a decent buy.  The mastering error does not affect it to a point that it's unwatchable.  In fact, you're likely not to notice.

If, however, you were interested in restoration techniques then this is a very disappointing mistake.  The restoration process on these episodes take time and to have VIDFire lost is heartbreaking.  The DVD says ""Digitally remastered picture and sound quality"", and in my opinion this is a misleading statement.

Back to the story:  It's one that I have no qualms introducing to non-who friends.  It's not as catchy or fun as Tomb of the Cybermen or Web of Fear can be, but it holds up well enough to not be boring.  The story is a simple base-under-siege concept that starts to dominate Doctor Who after this story.  The Cybermen want access to the Weather Control station located on the moon.  The Doctor and his friends must work to keep them out.

There is an important moment in this story:  The Doctor tells his companions they must stay and fight because there is evil.  Previously the Doctor was trapped in an adventure because of an external force, and hardly ever wanted to stay for any moral reason.  For the first time the Doctor comes to realize that they are here for a cause greater than themselves.

It's wonderful and fun, and certainly a blessing to see it amazingly animated.",1397692800,3,1405,4.673469387755102
5691601,3,B00C6ACWLC,"In the Patrick Troughton era of Doctor Who entitled ""The Moonbase"" has the Doctor and his companions Polly, Ben and newest member Jaime on the Moon in the year 2078.  There they encounter a base with a group of scientists working on the moon.  However a strange illness has taken many of its personel and only a handful of them are left to run the vast complex and the important work they do for Earth.
  The director is wary of the Doctor and his friends and thinks he maybe responsable for what is going on.  That is until Jaime comes down with the same illness as the rest of the base.  The Doctor is forced to find a cure and discover who is behind it all.  However as the Doctor gets cloaser to answers he thinks he maybe coming close to who or more importantly what is behind it.  And he fears it maybe Cybermen.  If that's true then the Doctor and all those in the base are about to be attacked by an enemy that knowns nothing of fear or any kind of emotion for that matter.
  Can the Doctor find out what the cybermen want?  Will he be able to save Jaime from whatever it is he is afflicted with?  Check out ""Moonbase"" to find out.
  Now that the synoposis is out of the way I need to speak about this DVD itself.  With this being one of the many classic series that lacked two of its episodes they decided toi animate it to fill in the gaps.  I should also point out that the animators were different from those used on ""The Ice Warriors"" so don't expect similar style of art.  With one behind the scene look on the episode's and a commentary that is split between acotrs in the orinigal episodes and blurbs of intwerviews both old and new of those who were on hand to work on the series.  This was a bit of a disappointment for me as a fan of the series.  With so few left and with many creating ""special editions"" on epsiodes already out.  One would have thought this would get better treatment.  So if your a die hard fan and want to see this episode as is.  Then please go right ahead.",1395878400,2,1998,4.172774869109948
5691602,4,B00C6ACWLC,"Not sure why I didn't give it 5 stars. Probably too many actions which moved the plot but did not make sense in the cumulative. And, unfortunately, while Troughton was a fine actor, I started watching Dr Who with Jon Pertwee and sometimes find the differences to jarring.

BBC did a good job in reassembling this story with reasonable animation. And, by buying it, you send the right message to the BBC regarding other stories with missing episodes. I assume that reconstruction costs are not cheap.

Buy it.",1395619200,3,508,4.761363636363637

The animation is pretty good, about the same as the previous releases.  A fairly solid story from the Troughton era with an isolated base under siege as a prelude to all out invasion by a tall, monsterous alien race.  I'm hearing the 2 live episodes are presented at the wrong speed here.  I didn't notice the difference but if so, one can get them on the Lost in Time set as well.",1394496000,,521,4.329896907216495

5691607,3,B00C6ACWLC,"I've come to a conclusion after watching this episode, that obviously the best stories were the the ones that were salvaged in their entirety. Yes, it's indeed a tragedy that much of Patty's tenure is gone forever,  and some wanker let them burn to ashes, but if these stories were indeed as special as they thought they were, the BBC would have been smart to have locked them away almost immediately after transmission. I say that, because as a fan of Doctor Who both old and new, despite a bravura performance by Troughton, the majority of his tenure was a real mixed bag.

The Moonbase is perhaps the best example of this amount of contrast; with its first two episodes building up some truly scary and creepy atmosphere- and then suddenly plateaus halfway through the third. This is also one of the few Second Doctor stories to include The Cybermen- and while they're terrifying here, they're not as frightening as they are in the ultra-fantastic Tomb of the Cybermen.

The TARDIS materializes on the moon in the year 1970. The Doctor, Jamie, Ben, and Polly discover a Moonbase where a number of scientists control the earth's weather; an Aussie, a few Brits and a Frenchman are stationed in the base. Jamie falls ill and spends much of the story in the sick bay, and a plague is spreading throughout the bay, which blackens people's nerves... it is at this point where the four discover the Cybermen are behind the plague.

The Cybermen are seen in only glimpses until the third episode, but their here-and-there appearances do provide some palpable tension. There is an eerie, dreamlike atmosphere throughout much of the episode, which does build up to something of an anti-climax. Which is what made this serial frustrating to sit through; there's tons of buildup throughout, with little to no payoff. The solution of how the Cybermen are defeated seems lazily brought up at the last minute, and is rather quite ridiculous.

As for the animated episodes, well, I thought it was cool how they re-enacted some of the episode through the animation. I quite liked the style of animation throughout, though some of the facial expressions and lip movements were quite exaggerated. Nonetheless, it was better than sitting through stills with audio over them (and subtitles used to describe what is happening). Overall, this is worth owning mostly for its historical value, but if you're hoping to get into Second Doctor material, try The Mind Robber or Tomb of the Cyberman instead.",1394236800,3,2482,4.872037914691943

5691610,1,B00C6ACWLC,"The Region 1 DVD release of The Moonbase has been severely botched by BBC Worldwide and they have NO intention to fix their mistake or offer replacement discs to customers who already purchased this abominable release!  It was mastered with an incorrect framerate of 23.98 (film speed) instead of the correct NTSC video framerate of 29.97 and essentially removes all of the VidFire sequences which is the process used by the Restoration Team to restore a ""live"" video look to sequences that were originally recorded in the studio onto videotape.  The result makes these sequences look like they were incorrectly shot on film instead and the pixels are muddy and smeared on episodes 2 and 4.

According to the Doctor Who DVD FAQ, BBC Worldwide is aware of the mastering problem and they have issued a statement that they have NO plans to fix it or offer replacement discs with a ""Take-it-or-leave-it"" attitude:

""MOONBASE MASTERING ERROR - UPDATE

Due to a tight schedule, Worldwide Americas had this DVD authored in the US instead of the UK (as they normally do).  In the process of converting this from the PAL video system, it should've been authored as interlaced video at 60 fields per second, however, the US engineers instead treated this as if it were progressive video. This has resulted in the loss of the VidFIRE video-look effect, and the episodes play slightly slower than they should play; they're about 1 minute longer than they ought to be.  They did apply a digital pitch-correction so that the sound didn't lower in pitch.  It's still playable, but the video-look is absent, and it does run 4% slow.""

This is just inexcusable for fans who have waited DECADES for a proper release.  With nearly all of the recovered Doctor Who stories already released on DVD, The Moonbase marks one of the last serials to get a DVD release and they just don't care!  If they change their minds later they will likely issue a ""Special Edition"" to get another money grubbing ""Double-Dip"" out of the fans.  For those of us who purchased this already, it is just unforgivable.  For those of you who haven't purchased it, DON'T!  Do not support a botched release by giving them your money.  If more people who have purchased this return them as manufacturing defects and sales start to suffer, maybe they will get the message loud and clear that the fans demand a CORRECTED re-mastering and force them to do something about this atrocity!",1393459200,101,2434,4.803357314148681

But, they've removed the vidfire and screwed up the playback speed this time. Episodes clock in at a minute longer than they should.

They should recall this and issue us all replacement discs. They won't, but it is the correct response to this problem. Instead I'll likely just do an amazon return.",1392422400,42,541,4.4
5691615,3,B00C6ACWLC,"Patrick Troughton is my favorite Doctor.  I gave this story 3 stars for a couple of reasons. Most certainly, this is classic British sci-fi television, but it is only average compared with others of the Troughton era. As far as Cybermen stories go, this is not as good as either the Invasion or Tomb of the Cybermen. Scripter Kit Pedler simply had gotten better when it came to the Cybermen stories by that time and Troughton had grown as the Doctor.
  After viewing a number of these 'missing episode' stories, I have come to a conclusion that this is an indication on how good the story is. For perhaps the reason that a collector liked them well enough to hold onto enough episodes to get a completed story. Even if the sorry piece of history of some idiot at the BBC mandating the wiping of the tapes did not happen, the Moonbase is not the best example of Troughton as the Doctor or Doctor Who in general.
  The animation. The BBC is not known for animation and are completely clueless about it. It is better than watching snapshots with the soundtrack played over it, but not much more. Unless the animation is done by a complete genius it is impossible to capture the intent of the director and the depth of the players in this manner. What we are left with are shots of boots walking across the ground and these crazy fluttering eyebrows on exaggerated expressions that look completely abnormal. Considering how important a property Doctor Who is for them, this level of animation is inexcusable. It's not like animation was discovered yesterday. Still great viewing and not a waste of time. Check it out.",1392422400,3,1613,4.625874125874126

This is probably the reason the price went down. Since they haven't recalled DVDs in the past when errors have occurred, I recommend NOT buying this DVD till the error has been corrected.

One Disk containing 4 episodes and the special Features

Episodes one and three are reproductions using animation.  I like but do not love the animation.  The drawings are spot on but I grew up watching cartoons and this just looks like stick figures.  A little more frames per second would help.  On the brighter side Cybermen are much more menacing in Anime.  Those idiot wiffle balls stuck to their suits actually look like actuators on the drawings.  I think it actually improves the look.

5691618,4,B00C6ACWLC,"They say that nothing dates a story more than ideas of the future. That is certainly true of the fourth Patrick Troughton Doctor Who adventure The Moonbase. Yet, once we move past the 1960's notions of what a 21st century Moonbase would look like, there is a good adventure story to be enjoyed.

By the point this story had originally aired back in 1966, the four regular stars of the series had become established for the most part. Patrick Troughton's Doctor fits that description in particular and he has some of his best moments in this story including the ""There are some corners of the universe..."" speech in episode two. As always, Troughton is the centerpiece of the story and a sheer joy to watch. His companions are just as good, though Frazer Hines spends much of the story in bed due to having to be inserted into the story at the last moment. The upside of this is that it gives Michael Craaze and Annekke Willis a chance to shine as Ben and Polly for the first time since The Power of the Daleks. If nothing else, The Moonbase gives the series regulars a chance to shine.

Then there is the supporting cast. Patrick Baar makes a nice (and thankfully not cliched) base leader in his role of Hobson, making a nice change from a very similar character in The Tenth Planet. Andre Maranne makes an interesting appearance as the French physicist and has some good chemistry with the series regulars. Much like The Tenth Planet before it, the supporting cast really rests on the silver monsters known as Cybermen.

After their debut in The Tenth Planet, the Cybermen make their second appearance in the series. The decision to replace the rather cheap-looking Cybermen with the more robotic-looking suits help to bring not only menace but realism to these monsters. The voices used in this story also mark an improvement over the sing-song voice that appeared in The Tenth Planet. Despite some questionable dialog (such as the ""stupid Earthling brains"" line in episode three for example), these Cybermen are a definite improvement over their predecessors.

Then of course there's always the production values. As I said at the beginning of this review, nothing dates more then ideas of the future. The sets of the Moonbase and the spacesuits used in this story are proof of that saying if there ever was any. The sets and costumes are a definite 1960's vision of the future, right down to the bubble-headed space suits and large the reel-to-reel computers seen in the base itself. While these views may seem unfair from some four decades later, they are nonetheless jarring to look at.

On the upside, there's the script by Kit Pedler (and an uncredited Gerry Davis) which follows the ""base under siege"" formula of many 1960's Doctor Who stories including The Tenth Planet. Despite the fact that it is essentially formulaic, the script plays with the formula to help make the story less than predictable. Even if the designs aren't up to task, the script still makes it enjoyable.

Perhaps the highlight of this release of the story is that it presents, alongside surviving episode two and four, animated reconstructions of missing episodes one and three. The animation here, handled by Planet 55 which also did animation for both The Reign Of Terror and The Tenth Planet, is their best effort yet. The characters are all recognizable while the Cybermen continue to lend themselves nicely to animation. Thankfully, the over-editing that hurt The Reign Of Terror animation is a thing of the past though the animation here does suffer very occasionally from staying on a shot for a second or two too long. Overall though the animation is very well done and might well be the best we've had since the Invasion nearly a decade ago.

Meanwhile, the other extras are perhaps a bit on the thin side, probably because of the cost of the animation. That being said there's a lovely little making of documentary (Lunar Landing) that focuses mainly on the memories of Frazer Hines and Anneke Wills as well as Cyberman actor Reg Whitehead discussing what it was like to transition from the original Cybermen costume to the ones used in this story. There's also a good series of commentaries moderated by the ever reliable Toby Hadoke and the usual informative info text commentary on episodes two and four. Not a lot of extras but what's here is well done.

So, while the set design and costumes might make The Moonbase as a story seem dated, there is still more than enough to enjoy. From the performances of the regulars and the supporting cast to the Cybermen and the story itself, there is plenty to enjoy as we can now see the story in something akin to its entirety. So, while it might not be a Doctor Who classic, its remains a watchable Doctor  Who story and a highlight from the Troughton era.",1392336000,7,4797,4.742206235011991
5691619,4,B00C6ACWLC,"Just viewed this early Patrick Troughton story and while a little slow was enjoyable to watch. The BBC did a good job on the animation of Episodes 1 & 3. Always nice to see the Cybermen, the Doctor's second greatest foe next to the Daleks. Not a lot of special features. Only audio commentary and a short ""making of"" feature. The one surprise was when I checked out the ""Coming Soon"" section. Was expecting scenes from the upcoming ""Web Of Fear"" DVD but instead the scenes were from Story #32, ""The Underwater Menace"". Since 3 out of the 4 episodes of this story are presumed lost I wonder how the BBC will release this.

8577630,4,B00C6ACWLC,"Second Doctor Patrick Troughton tries to land the TARDIS on Mars, so naturally they show up on Earth's moon. The year is AD 2070 and the Earth's weather is run from a moon base near where the Doctor and companions land. The base has a virus or plague that is slowly incapacitating the workers (who are all scientists). Blame falls on the newcomers though the real problem turns out to be an infestation of Cybermen!

For two of the four episodes, the video has been lost. Animations were created to fill in for episodes one and three, much like for the Reign of Terror DVD. The animations don't really capture the amazing expressiveness of Troughton's face, though otherwise they match the visual style of the story well enough. The audio is the usual high-quality sound effects from the BBC. The Cybermen are a classic and enjoyable set of villains--they aren't shouty and over-the-top like others but still have plenty of menace. Seeing the female companion Polly asked to make coffee is nicely balanced with her coming up with a chemical concoction to take out the Cybermen. She's not just a pretty face who screams and passes out when the Cybermen show up (though she does do that too).

8577631,5,B00C6ACWLC,"I considered purchasing this Patrick Troughton DVD of Moonbase numerous times and kept detouring away because of some rather harsh reviews left by others about it.  I HONESTLY was thinking that it would turn out to be, literally, unwatchable trash.  The negative reviews are intensely detailed, drowning the reader with all of their highly educated video nerd jargon.  They're clearly wanting the potential buyers to steer clear of this one because according to them this is an inexcusable stunt that the BBC has committed.  They want this horrible release corrected.  Period.

Since the DVD was only about $14.00 I decided to take a chance, finally.  If it turned out to be a presentation that was purely rock bottom then I would see it as though I was warned and accept it.

This is what my reaction was to this 4 part story with parts 1 and 3 brought back to life by cartoon and 2 and 4 still existing as live action...

The cartoon animation right off the bat was stunning, very well done with the recreation of the actors looking dead on like the real people.  In other Dr Who classics I have, the recreated animated episodes are just still frames paralleled with the audio throughout the entire episode, in this the cartoons move.  The eyes move, the lips move, they walk around and interact with everything which I thought was awesome.  The animated Cybermen were particularly impressive.  I am pretty sure that the animation alone must have taken quite a bit of time and work to put together.  The ending of episode 2 shows a live action Cyberman hop off of a table and surprise the humans, the beginning of the animated episode 3 that same sequence is recreated as a cartoon that looks very precise.  Beautiful work.  All of the live action of episodes 2 and 4 are just as good as any other classic Dr Who I've purchased.  They are just fine in the presentations which deliver, all in all, a wonderful Patrick Troughton addition to any Dr Who fan's collection.  The disc is also loaded with plenty of special features.

I am very glad I bought this and I think the people who are posting the negatives need to stop crying and babbling on about their video nerd expectations.  It is very easy to see why BBC would ignore this issue since there is nothing wrong with this DVD at all.

To be able to go onto Amazon and comb through all these different classic Dr Who stories on DVD on your iphone, order whatever you want, have it sent directly to your front door, brand new, factory sealed, jammed with bonus features, painstakingly recreated animated episodes.....I would have to say it is a blessing.

The very existance of these old classics is a miracle.

For an old TV show, the film quality was good enough.  The story wasn't all that exciting and a bit hokey even to a Dr. Who fan like me.  Not one of the top serials by far.  However, I liked seeing this missing show.  I'm not a big fan of the animation, but guess it was the only way to see episodes 1 and 3, so that's that.
