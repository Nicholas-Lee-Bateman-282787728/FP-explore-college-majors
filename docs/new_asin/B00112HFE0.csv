The dark, discordant music was as loud as the narration, so I couldn't hear the narrator well. This went on for the entire video, from what I could tell. It did not go with the movie/video at all. My husband called to me from the other room to ask why I was watching a scary movie, because of the music. I couldn't watch it and removed it from my watchlist. :-(",1485907200,,460,4.065934065934066
8239903,3,B00112HFE0,"I rented this online for $1.99.  It should be free with Amazon prime, there's nothing exceptional about it. In fact it's narrated in such a boring monotone I fell asleep more than once. Don't waste your money on buying this unless you absolutely must own everything Kandinsky related. If you don't already have it, get Will Grohman's biography for a few dollars more.
