6080808,5,B00GJT22VQ,"I was a small child when Cheyenne was first on television.  I looked to Clint Walker as a role model growing up, especially as Cheyenne.  His DVD releases have brought back memories of a better time in my life, and these DVD's are as good as I remember.  I'm glad they decioded to issue the final season in a timely manner, and I hope Ol' Clint gets some residuals.  I loved them in '56, and am truly impressed that I find so much depth now that I am in my '60s.  Thank you!!",1388448000,15,475,4.064516129032258
6080809,5,B00GJT22VQ,"As was the previous seasons, Cheyenne in its last season never lost track of the production values that made this series the success that it was.  To bad it ran only for seven seasons but Warner Bros mixed the Cheyenne Show with several other series to make 39 episodes for each season as most other series did so on their own which may have only a one or two season run.  This mix was an excellent marketing ploy to draw viewers to the network that aired their TV shows.  The complete Cheyenne TV series (all seven seasons) is a must have for all western collection.",1388361600,,567,4.380952380952381
6080810,5,B00GJT22VQ,"Was very satisfied with the story quality of the Cheyenne season six & seven, however, I will probably not purchase
the other Cheyenne episodes because of the ""poor sound quality"" which makes  it difficult to understand what
the actors are saying because the is no ""CAPTION"" feature.  Why can't a caption be included in these older
movies? Is a caption feature available for all the Cheyenne movies??",1387756800,,400,4.955223880597015
6080811,5,B00GJT22VQ,If you are a Cheyenne fan then this is for you. Good stories to each episode. I have all the other series and found them all to be for me the best TV western of all time. Hope Warner Brothers now start to bring out the Bronco series as these were a great western series as well.,1387497600,2,278,3.8947368421052633
6080812,5,B00GJT22VQ,"It has been noted that when Cheyenne premiered on September 20, 1955, as part of an anthology series, Warner Brothers Presents which contained three separate, alternating series, one show was based on Casablanca and the other was based on King's Row.

Like the railroad stretching West, Cheyenne showed that a one hour dramatic vehicle was possible.

The lone Western hero who could be marshal, cow puncher, wanderer, or anything the producer and/or writers wanted, changed television in a significant way.

And by the time Cheyenne threw his last punch and pulled his trigger for a final showdown, one-hour filmed dramas had become the norm, filling nighttime airwaves on all three networks.

By the time Cheyenne rode into its final season in 1963, the television landscape had changed dramatically, the way so many Western stories heralded the radical change of the West from unchartered frontiers into hustling boom-towns bursting on the edge of the Pacific Ocean.

The Warner Brothers private eye and western series, along with Disney, made ABC, a real player as a third network.

Sexuality was a prime motivator in early Cheyennes. I suggest you buy the first couple of seasons and compare it with the final season.

I haven't relooked at the first season's Cheyennes, but I can tell you without any fear of being wrong that husky, handsome Clint Walker may talk softly and draw quickly, but as surely as there is gunplay, there is also always some reason for him to take his shirt off, and go into a clinch bare-chested with a female lead.

Check out the episodes in Cheyenne Season 2, Volumes 1 & 2.

As the entire series now becomes available on DVD with Cheyenne  Season 7, one more plea to Warner Archives, before they start putting the private eye series onto disc: restore the bumpers!

I've written this before, I'm not stopping now.

No one did bumpers between commercials better than Warners.

Warners did them better than Disney! And the company from ""the entertainment capital of the world"" never did it better than they did on the detective shows. The theme-song came up. The announcer's voice was sure and clear. The title of the episode was against the Sunset Strip locale. All this told you that you were watching something special.

If they can get the bumpers into Peter Gunn, Dobie Gillis and Hawaii 5-0, then why not get them from the company that showed them how to do it best?

Please, Warner Archive, get back to me on this!

You can read much more on Cheyenne in my latest Riding Shotgun column up on Comicsbulletin.com, along with photos.

6080822,4,B00GJT22VQ,"I liked the story lines more in some but for the last show it was disapointing.
Thought he would do something special.  All he did to make it the last show is say he was thinking of settling down.
They should of had a show where he finds a lady and falls in Love.
He had a speaking part on one show that was longer than usual and more dramatic.  Very good.
He is a fine actor and gave a new class of cowboy to the screen.
Who was really soft spoken but could talk clearly?  Gary Cooper.
Clint had a wonderful singing voice and i had his album years ago.
I would like to ask, where did the theme song with the words sung go?  It was there in the original on TV.

We love you Clint. God Bless1",1443571200,,691,3.907142857142857

6080824,5,B00GJT22VQ,"All of Clint's movies, Cheyenne episodes, TV appearances are very entertaining. I believe he is/has tried to live his life in a worthwhile manner!!
I believe I have a good sense of decency, morals and from what I have read about Clint, he is genuinely endeavoring to do his best at whatever
he does. The one thing I am mystified by is how his wives have felt about him kissing all of the women he has on the air. Of course a trusting
relationship between man and wife would surely lay to rest any feelings of unfaithfulness.
 I think it has been very refreshing to see how much more polished, self assured he became from the beginning of Cheyenne to just 7-8 years
later when he left the set of Cheyenne. I enjoyed his portrayal of ""Yellowstone Kelly"", the scenery was beautiful, the color was brilliant and so
amazing after how old this movie is. Clint has also been somewhat selective when choosing the roles he wants to do.
  In case you have not noticed, I am an avid fan of his movies, TV shows and if you haven't purchased his books, you will be thoroughly
entertained by ""Yaqui Gold"" and ""Long Arrow."" I believe he is one person who will be remembered for many, many years to come. It can make one sad to think at Clint's age --88--that he might not be with us many more years and HE WILL BE SORELY MISSED!! Of course, he may be a person who is destined to live to 100+ and I believe whenever his ""time"" comes, he will be totally ready for it. PS. Hopefully he and Susan did not lose any-
thing on their property that can not be replaced! I believe they live up fairly close to where the fires were doing the most damage possibly.",1442793600,,1637,4.308441558441558
