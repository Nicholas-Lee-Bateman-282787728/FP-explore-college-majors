8485238,1,B005SLBAXM,"When the first DVD was not readable, they very promptly sent a replacement DVD. When the second DVD also did not work  I requested  how to return both yet haven't heard back. I use my DVD player all the time, so I know its not my player. So odd that neither DVD worked. I am so very disappointed. So this rating has nothing to do with the content...as Ive not had the opportunity to see / evaluate the content. .  Both DVDs were defective. I would still love to be able evaluate the content!
