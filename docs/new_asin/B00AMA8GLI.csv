5450470,3,B00AMA8GLI,After playing this in a couple DVD players it still skips at the end despite being a brand new disc. My daughter loves it otherwise.,1380844800,,132,4.32
5450471,5,B00AMA8GLI,"My son is a huge Wiggles fan. He loves this movie and the songs. There are both new and old songs included. The movie doesn't really have a storyline, and the surfing topic is very loosely tied in, but my son doesn't care. The new Wiggles are also in the movie. Murray plays the Genie, Emma is one of the featured Wiggly dancers, and Lachlan is one of the Wags performers.",1373673600,2,372,4.253521126760563
5450472,5,B00AMA8GLI,"This used to be on You Tube and my son loved this video, so I found it here on Amazon for a great price!",1370649600,,104,3.375
5450473,5,B00AMA8GLI,Love this DVD. It has all all of my favorite songs on it. I loved when the ordinal singer Greg page return to the wiggles. It's great in so many ways.,1368057600,,150,3.870967741935484
5450474,5,B00AMA8GLI,"My son has been a fan of the Wiggles for several years. I think we own every DVD they ever made. This one does not dissappoint . It was so nice to see ""Greg Wiggle"". I know he had to leave because he was sick. It was a treat for my son as Greg was always his favorite. These Wiggles are no ""Spring chickens"" yet their performance is always A+++ I would have liked to see Jeff really surfing. lol Great fun, family entertainment. It beats a lot of the other stuff on TV. I just ordered the ""Celebration"" dvd. I know its the farewell concert. We are going to miss them. So many years of fun.",1367712000,,589,4.042735042735043
5450475,5,B00AMA8GLI,"Nothing proves a good part of The Wiggles success is personality driven than having six of them on screen. It feels like Greg never left. Simon Pryce, Ringo the Ringmaster and now the new red Wiggle, is Gino the Genie who fits in so well with The Wiggles and Captain Feathersword it feels like he's always been with them. Picnic: The Musical! Opens with a daring stunt, Greg sits up quickly, and the horrors of his and Murray's pasty white legs in shorts. While frolicking on the beach Anthony's dogs discover an interesting bottle and legend has it there's a genie inside who grants wishes! But Greg is back so what more could a Wiggle wish for? How about footage of Jeff really surfing!

This is good old fashioned Wiggles fun, they're free from the studio to fool around making a simple grass hill look like the most fun thing in the world. You'll want to dress up like a mango and doing a silly walk too. Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves and they want to be there. The around the world scenes are neat, were they filmed while on tour? Be on the look out for Emma as one of the dancers and something tells me Lachy has been helping Wags do hand stands. From a grown up POV this is one of the more tolerable DVDs.

In real life Anthony has food sensitivities but it's his son Antonio who has the severe peanut allergy and awareness has become one of his causes. They also inform on checking if someone has an allergy before eating, not making people eat food they don't want to, and getting a grown up if there's a problem in a way that's easy for kids to grasp.",1367452800,3,1579,4.36734693877551
5450476,5,B00AMA8GLI,"My three year old can't get enough of the Wiggles in their latest production.  The hair on their heads may be a little whiter but they still have the ""moves"" and lots of energy! My daughter loved dancing to the Puppy song and copying the hand motions in the Hands on Your Head song. The Banana song was the one that she requested we replay again and again. I really liked the lesson and the song about allergies.  We know several families with food allergies and we are always looking for ways to reinforce that we need to ask the parents of our little friends before we offer to share snacks.  The Wiggles will always have a special place in my heart. They have entertained my three children on many a road trip.  I love the smile it brings to my daughter's face when I dance along with her to her favorite Wiggle songs.",1364083200,7,821,4.311688311688312

5450482,5,B00AMA8GLI,"Greg is back for the first time, in this new movie.  Jeff loves to surf the ocean waves, the other wiggles enjoy Dorothy's beach picnic and try new foods...but look out, some people can have allergies.

It was wonderful to have old songs right from Wiggle Bay and Sailing Around the World.",1408233600,,289,4.538461538461538

5450484,2,B00AMA8GLI,"I got the feeling that the promo for this video was way better than the actual video itself.  My daughter was excited to see the ""real"" Wiggles in one last vide instead of the new ones....but she didn't have any interest in this one at all minus a song or two.",1381968000,,260,4.098039215686274

8553592,5,B00AMA8GLI,"I have a special needs son that is extremely picky on what he watches.  His current rotation of DVDs are Spider-Man (the one with Tobey Maguire) and Surfer Jeff.  He will watch them over and over and over . . . so much so that we have to replace his DVD player at least once every couple of months.  Anyway, Surfer Jeff has a lot of great songs that my son, loves.  There are songs about allergies, peanut butter, oranges, puppies, traveling in Europe, and of course Jeff Surfing (spoiler alert:  He hasn't had a wipe out yet).  If you have a special needs child or young child that enjoys The Wiggles, then this DVD is for them.  As far as movies go that I have to listen to at least 5 times a day, this one is the most tolerable of any Wiggles type child show.  A word of caution, you might find yourself singing the songs in places that will get you some strange looks (like work).",1484265600,2,884,4.189349112426036
