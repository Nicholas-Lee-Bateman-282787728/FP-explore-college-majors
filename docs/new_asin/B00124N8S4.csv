3076536,5,B00124N8S4,"For this show's legion of fans, I would imagine a blu ray release at some point is inevitable.
I'm sure with the increasing popularity of blu ray we are likely to see this released when the second movie comes to DVD and blu ray. But I would love to see it sooner!
They know we will all buy it, it's just a matter of when :)",1255564800,3,323,3.909090909090909
3076537,5,B00124N8S4,"I have been a fan of the series ""Sex and the City"" since 2000, when I watched HBO's recap of the first two seasons one late night on HBO2.  From that moment on, even at the age of 13 I feel in love with these characters: Miranda (the cynic), Charlotte (the old-fashioned), Samantha (the slut), and Carrie (the social anthropologist).  But those one-dimension descriptions do not do the series justice at all.  For 6 beautiful seasons the HBO comedy turned dramedy focused upon the life and adventures of a group of friends who see their friendship mature and blossom into a family while they try to navigate down the crazy road of love.

Over a year ago when I heard news that a long-awaited feature-film was actually a possibility to say the least I was a little scared.  I remember the how for the course of a year the anticipation kept building up and up for the films impending May 2008.  And when cast interviews, trailers, and posters started to appear I got really excited.  And then release day came and I was there at midnight with my best friend, dressed up and excited.  And to say honest the movie didn't disappoint at all.

While the film had some flaws at the element of being a feature film (what is to be expected from a first-time director), it wasn't the special effects or camera angles that were important.  No, it was the acting and the reunion of characters that fans have been missing for the past 5 years.  The story serious didn't disappoint, even with its whooping 2  hour run-time.  It was the story that everyone was hoping for: One of reunions, love, the testament of commitment, the butterflies that come with everything at stake, and the beautiful experiences of love.  At the level of plot the producers kept almost everything rush until after the film's release - which was a very good idea.  Giving away even the minorist of plot details would destroy the films experience, and lessen the effect of the girl's reunion.  All I have to say is that there are moments you'll find your jaw on the group, your eyes tearing up, and your chest aching from laughter.  It truly is an adventure in those 2  hours.

The film's $55 million release weekend take accompanied by the almost $400 total gross is a testament to the fans that love this show.  HBO has already planned a sequel and even a third film later down the line.  And while I believe those films will be amazing - they will not be able to capture the magic of this original film.  It was the reunion people didn't think would happen, and it provide that beyond the dramas of life, friendship will truly survive.",1217203200,,2598,4.541935483870968

Please, HBO, get the ball rolling. There are HUGE fans of the series who want to see a pristine version of the show. The original DVDs are very grainy and not the correct ratio for modern tvs.

8243844,5,B00124N8S4,"I won't go into details about the series. If you're here, you already know how great the series is and all the highs and lows of Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha, as well as the men in their lives including Mr. Big, Steve, Harry, Smith, and Aidan, just to name a few.

Obviously, HBO should know there is a market for the series to be on Blu-Ray, considering both theatrical movies HAVE been released in the Blu-Ray format!

And, really, as much as I love this series, the first two or three seasons on DVD look rather poor. So now is the perfect time to remaster this gem on Blu-Ray! There are plenty who would snap it up in a heartbeat, myself included.

So, what are you waiting for, HBO? Don't you like additional revenue? Bring SATC to Blu-Ray now, please!",1383264000,4,769,4.439716312056738
