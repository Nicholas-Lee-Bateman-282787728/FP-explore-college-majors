4081971,3,B0037RBVP6,"Although this is very informative and interesting, it is also filmed like a Podcast to a group of college students. I don't really care for that type of format myself, but others may really enjoy it. Everything he begins with connects to the next topic, and it flows together a bit too much with all of the information he is trying to give us. By flowing together too much, I mean that there is no time for the viewer to make their own connections and opinions about their observations. The information seems a bit jumbled together. I like reflection time, but again others may not, and they may really enjoy this type of informational presentation.",1395360000,,649,4.6521739130434785
4081972,4,B0037RBVP6,This movie represents the facts of how our environment and food choices are dependent upon one another. Who wants a hamburger based on the taste and how many gallons of water does it take to produce it. The world is starving for fresh food which comes from the earth. Why can't we supply it?,1393718400,,291,4.407407407407407
4081973,2,B0037RBVP6,"I like the premise, but that's about all.

The narrator is bit too upset sounding, and there really wasn't much video, it's just some guy talking. I didn't hear anything based on facts or research, just a bunch of still pictures and someone ranting. I agree with most of the points, it just wasn't something I enjoyed watching at all.

So I only made it through half of it. The second half may have been stellar, but I have my doubts.",1393372800,2,434,4.345679012345679
4081974,5,B0037RBVP6,This video was very informative.  The highlights for me were the destruction of the rain forest and the leaching of the pesticides and animal waste into our water supply.  And the fact that the informer wasn't over bearing or forcing a vegetarian or vegan life style on people.  He just presented the facts.,1392422400,2,307,4.754716981132075
4081975,5,B0037RBVP6,"Although 7, almost 8 years old now, the general message of this movie is a powerful one that can and should speak to everyone. The statistics are a little outdated (since it was filmed in 2006) but they are ALL part of constant growing number of concerns and issues that we face today. This movie is in my top 10 favourites when it comes to ""documentaries"". The speaker is good and topics flow from one seamlessly into the next. Sound quality and b-role are well editted and create further impact to the points the speaker makes throughout the film. There is a great deal of information from our solar system to the eco system on planet earth, and from major corporations down to the individual. I would recommend this to everyone, even if this does not change what or how you do things as a consumer I hope it at least leaves with a better consciousness of your actions and the combined actions of everyone on this planet.",1383696000,3,923,4.5
4081976,3,B0037RBVP6,The information contained in this documentary is good.  I found it hard to sit and watch without falling asleep or getting up to do other things.,1377561600,,145,4.576923076923077
4081977,1,B0037RBVP6,I tried to watch this but it was just ashort introduction & snippet there was no actual program. I hope it gets fixed,1368576000,,117,4.130434782608695
4081978,5,B0037RBVP6,This video should be mandatory viewing for every student around the world. We only have one chance to get this right and we need to take action! Go Vegan and join a vegan or AR group now.,1362787200,3,187,4.081081081081081
4081979,5,B0037RBVP6,"This DVD is exactly what I was looking for, concise, not too long, not too short! Its approach is what young people and everybody need to understand: our planet Earth is the most beautiful place in the universe (from what we know from it!), and human beings are behaving in a totally irresponsible way, destroying landscapes, habitats, resources, and soil. Much of the harm is done because of the last sixty years of increasing consumption habits and because our industrialized, hyper intensive agriculture and food industry just wants to make more and more money, without any respect for the earth, for the animals and for our own health!
I am truly thankful that some people are doing the right thing to spread a lucid vision of todays world, and to address the question of the future: how will the earth look like for the future generations, if we continue on the same path?
I will be glad to show this documentary to my students, provoke debates, and tell them that each one of us can make a difference!",1327104000,11,1007,4.662921348314606

8390704,1,B0037RBVP6,"Politically correct attitudes to teach to children who are to be future victims of depopulation is what this drivel is. Animal fats are demonized as the cause of all disease, and evil humans are the curse on the land that has to be eliminated. Whole grains are good for you. There is no mention of glyphosate or of atrazine in our diets from those wondrous healthy Monsanto vegetable food sources as a cause the of immune diseases he lays at the feet of cows and chickens and pigs,  and no mention of todays epidemic of false diagnoses of Multiple Sclerosis resulting from DHA deficiency due to the substitution of animal fats from people's diets with soy and corn and canola oils. Children are taught the same drivel we were taught fifty years ago in this film, about how we all only need plant carbs whereas animal proteins are poisonous for us, even now after it led to an obese and diabetic society filled with heart disease. He forgot that the arsenic, cadmium, lead, etc.  in ""healthy"" whole grains is mostly in the shells, and it causes all sorts of cancers. He doesn't mention that a generation of whole grain eaters has also had twenty or more years of antacid addiction and elevated bowel cancer levels from too much harsh fiber in whole grained breads,  rather than soluble fiber that one should have been eating....  Point after point he rolls on giving misinformation that's been shown to be wrong in the last ten years. But he's no doubt politically very correct. We have to kill off all the humans and the cows for the earth.",1422748800,4,1540,4.609489051094891

8390706,1,B0037RBVP6,"I've watched a LOT of food and nature documentaries, scientific programs, and have a background in natural sciences. I have never seen a film with so many factual inaccuracies and so much nonsense.

This guy claims that 50% of people are infertile. He claims that all heart disease is caused by eating meat. He claims that astronauts eat a vegetarian diet in space. These claims are false, as are MANY of the other things he says in this talk.

I appreciate his point, he makes many good points, but .whatever truths he speaks are negated by the shear volume of crap that comes out of his mouth. After watching this I am really irritated that someone can stand there and spew out so much garbage and people are sitting there giving this load of crap 5 stars. This is evidence that the people liking this are just as full of crap as he is, and just as willing to disregard the truth if it suits them.",1403395200,3,899,4.409638554216867
