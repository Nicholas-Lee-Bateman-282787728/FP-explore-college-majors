8251612,5,B0013KX6HA,"In his career as a filmmaker, Loach is famous for taking small, closeup shots of character's lives. In MY NAME IS JOE he deftly tells the story of a disenfranchised Scotsman who is finally, in his late 30s, trying to get his life back on track. Or rather any track, as he's just spent the first half of his life blind drunk. Joe meets a social worker, they form an awkward, unlikely couple and the film follows them as they reach out to and then push away from each other over and over. Joe has a problem. His old life (constantly drunk and working for a local drug dealing thug) won't leave him alone. Even though Joe is sober his neighborhood is not. Heroin worms its way through the community, wrecking lives as surely as alcoholism does. A fascinating character study but one you'll want to leave the English subtitles on for, unless you're from Scotland.",1307145600,,859,4.512820512820513
