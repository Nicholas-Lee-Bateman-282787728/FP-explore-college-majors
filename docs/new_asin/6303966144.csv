747376,5,6303966144,"The Guyver series is what started me on my collection of Japanese Anime.  This series spawned a couple of so-so live-action movies, but if you've seen those, don't judge the anime by them.  It is an excellent series about a teenager who accidentally gains the unstoppable power of the Guyver - a super space suit created by aliens.  His war against a secret organization bent on world domination that uses metamorphing humans provides some spectacular battles and storylines.  I am not sure how many episodes will be on the DVD, but I've only ever seen 12 released on video here in the U.S.  Hopefully, more were produced so that they can come out in this format.  A definite must see.",1044921600,,685,4.666666666666667
747377,5,6303966144,"This is a great anime.  its the first in the Guyver series, hence the title ""genesis of the guyver.""  This one tells the story of how Sho, the big hero, becomes the guyver and fights human mutants, the zoanoids.  The animation is good and the Guyver looks wicked.  The megasmasher is the BEST FINISHING MOVE EVER.  theres only one thing missing from this, as well as from alot of other animes:  great music.  Theres no good guy music when he does cool stuff.  But thats the only drawback.  I strongly recommend this title.",1004227200,3,522,4.526881720430108
747378,5,6303966144,"As my title says, this is a fantastic series!  A normal high school student named Sho Fukamachi comes into contact with an living cybersuit called the Guyver.  The Guyver is basically a living creature that merges  with humans and gives them incredible superpowers.  Sho has this thing on  his shoulders that opens a dimensional portal that the Guyver comes  through, then the Guyver wraps itself around Sho's body (However, we don't  learn that the Guyver comes from another dimension until later in the  series.).  However, there is the evil Kronos corporation that created the  Guyver, along with 2 other Guyver suits.  The Kronos corporation wants all  the Guyver suits back, and they'll kill anyone who tries to get in their  way!  The Kronos corporation experiments with people and turns them into  horrible monsters called Zoanoids which they use as soldiers.  Fortunately,  the Guyver has incredible weaponry that Sho uses to fight the Kronos  coporation.  One of these weapons is the Mega-smasher, the Guyver's most  powerful weapon.  Sho grabs ahold of two fleshy panels on the Guyver's  pectorals, and pulls them open to reveal two powerful lasers which can  destroy anything.  The Guyver can also make incredibly sharp blades come  out of each of it's elbows.  With weapons like these, the Kronos  corporation had better watch out!",958003200,7,1343,5.097222222222222
747567,5,6303966144,"The Guyver is one of the best anime I have ever watched. Be careful when buying the second one, make sure it says Bio-Booster Armor or else you will have episodes that do not match up.",1261526400,,184,4.138888888888889
747568,3,6303966144,"All in all, the DVDs are BAD my friends. The opening sequence is completely cut from the episodes, and replaced with this awful clip sequence of cuts from variouse episodes. It's not even a song, and it just makes you want to cringe. To make it worse, the Chapter cuts are done so badly, you can't even skip the bad opening without cutting in a quarter of the way through the episode. And the extra features are minimal if any.

But, all in all, if this is the only way to GET Guyver on DVD, then it is a sacrifice that must be made. Aside from the few minor edits to the actual anime, it's still all there (even if you have to go looking through the extra features for episode 12.) If you don't want to keep rewinding through three episodes on your collection of 4 low quality VHSs, get it. Just be prepared to hit the Fast Forward as oppose to the skip on your remote.",1135036800,,870,4.178571428571429
747569,4,6303966144,Guyver is about a boy named Sho Fukamachi who accidently comes across one of three units known as the guyvers unbeknownst to him the evil chronos corporation and it's army of alienic bio weapons known as the zoanoids are in pursuit. The guyver is the most powerful of zoanoids chronos lost when a rogue zoanoid steals them and chronos will do anything to retrieve the guyver units. It is a good action packed cartoon one that is fun to watch on a saturday afternoon it is rather violent but not so much so that it takes away from the story. I liked it because the action and characters were awesome and the plot was in my opinion rather innovative. This is a must see for true anime fans.,1091145600,,688,4.3828125
747570,4,6303966144,"When I was a wee little 4th grader, I discovered this gem at a local blockbuster. This series is just fraught with gore. Episode 5, ""The Death of Guyver"", to me still has one of anime's goriest moments when we see Sho and Enzyme fight (severed/bitten off limbs, a fragmented head, a brutal impaling & coughing up a crap load of blood, and overload after Sho's control metal is ripped out). Anywhom, this series has a cool plot that is unique enough to not fall under average. An ancient race of people many years ago created 3 guyver units that grant their users the power of the bio booster armor. Sho and his friend Tetsuo are walking in the forest after school as a huge explosion occurs. Out comes a guyver unit and Sho ends up bonding with it. The Chronos company had been trying to retrieve the guyver units, and pursue Sho to obtain his for their needs. You'll definately dig this if you're into anime or gory flicks.",1084838400,,924,4.4411764705882355
747571,5,6303966144,"This is one of the best anime of the time. This movie will get you hooked if you're truly an anime fan. I strongly recomend this action packed anime, once you get this dvd, you will truly get the second dvd for sure. Plus, its very cheap and affordable. Unlike the other anime series where you have to buy it for a couple hundred dollars. The other good thing about this animet is that it has more then two hours long! Unlike the other anime where you only get like an hour or half an hour. I don't know about you but I'm the kind of person who wants an anime to be as long as it can. The longer the better. Now thats something that you should drfinetly think about. And again, i stongly advise you to get this anime if you haven't seen the eposodes. I liked it and I know for sure you will too.  (note: this is only for those of you who like action packed fighting anime).",1075939200,2,873,4.075581395348837
747572,3,6303966144,"Well, actually just one thing: Manga Video. Manga Video is to Anime what Clear Channel is to Radio. That may not sound entirely fair considering that Manga Video is responsible for bringing us Ghost in the Shell, Perfect Blue, the Patlabor Movies, and now Magic Knight Rayearth (on one disc!), but they are not without their poor decisions and bad calls. Yoshiki Takaya's Bio-Booster Armour Guyver epitomizes this.
Originally, the episodes were available in six VHS volumes with two episodes each (at about twenty to thirty dollars a pop) with original opening and closing credits and music. They were released through U.S.Renditions and L.A.Hero. Later, Manga Video revived the series by releasing each episode on its own videotape (called ""datas"" and for about twelve to fifteen dollars a pop) which seemed pretty economical (especially if you were picky about your favorite episodes) until you actually watched the tapes and found out that Manga video had changed the opening and closing credit music with ""Guyver Rock!"" If that does not make you cringe, you are of a stronger will than I. Also, Manga decided to change some of the voice actors for the english track (namely the Zoanoid Data files and some of the zoanoids themselves) which should probably not bother anyone, but I think it is still worth pointing out.
The quality of the transfer is spot-on, which may not exactly be a good thing. We get to see all of the poorly cleaned cels, all the sloppy camera moves, all the discolorations in skin-tones, and all the lousy english-text-boxes laid over the japanese credits. But fear not, you can see and hear the original opening credits in the special features menu. Why Manga did not just simply present the credits in their original format in the first place is beyond reasoning, so I have given up trying. My advice for watching: neither the english nor japanese audio tracks are particularly impressive, so just hit that mute button, pop in your favorite KMFDM album (or whatever you like) and let the images do what they do best.
The highlight of the disc, in my mind, apart from the archival quality of DVD over VHS (which should go without saying) is the complete collection of Zoanoid Data files. Reminiscent of the animation sequences of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which is the ONLY time you will hear H2G2 and Guyver in the same context), these sequences are informative, imaginative, and give some great insight into character designs. Yoshiki Takaya did not simply draw monsters and let them go to town on each other, he was trying to create a universe. If only Guyver's escapades into the world of audio/visual media did the source material justice.
Final Word: Four out of Five for presentation, Two out of Five for butchery. Average is Three. NOW, ON TO VOLUME 2 AND THE FINAL INJUSTICE!",1065484800,9,2820,4.877083333333333
747573,1,6303966144,"Really I do, it may be rare for customers to give negative reviews, but there are few titles as worthy of slander as The Guyver is.
The phrase ""this series has everything!"" has been used way too many times to describe pretty much anything. It needs to be inforced that just because s show may do something dosn't nessissarily mean that it does it well. Guyver has many of the elements mentioned above, it just fails to pull any of them off with any kind of flare. It also contains more cheese than you could possibly ever hope to fit into a cheese factory. The animation is a little below par, even for its time, and the designs are certainly lacking in character. All attempts to make you feel towards these 'bio-enemies' should generally result in fits of laughter, and way too many cliches are employed far too often (just how many times does Sho have to rescue either the girl or a family member!)
Guyver is distasteful at best; the first couple of episodes do show a small amount of promise, but it all goes downhill from there. The story is cheesy and poorly paced, the themes are pulled off in unconvincing manner, and really, it just fails misserably to do anything well at all. Not one of the better moments in the history of Japanese Animation by a long shot.
I highly reccomend you steer well clear from this, if you're interested in an 80's action anime then I would recommend the Bubblegum Crisis OAV Megaseries box set, true it costs more but at least it wouldnt be money wasted.",1051056000,2,1493,4.492647058823529
747574,5,6303966144,"This the best series ever. A creation of god, used for protecting the Gods, never meant for a mere mortal. With curiosity within the universe, our gods brought forth one of his child, man, and protected him with his power. Un-estimating man power, thy child has grown beyond the control of gods. A child of destruction, death, and demons. The god gave forth the name: GUYVER: Out of control. Now we step thru time and set ourself towards the future to the life of Sho Fukamachi, a highschool student whose life is about to change, a change for the worse and for the good.

If you love the whole giant corporation running the world theme, Biological weapons, Aliens, crazy superhuman abilities and bloody gore filled movies this may just be the anime for you! I do not however understand how these sellers expect to get 744 dollars for volume one and two separately, hell I don't understand them trying to get 200 dollars like the two pack is. I bought mine for 40 bucks when it came out. I guess I shouldn't have pawned them. Oh well, I'll just buy the used ones.",1373587200,,615,4.4035087719298245

7857724,5,6303966144,"The Guyver has had 3 anime versions over the years. Since I find it hard to pick a favorite I kind of have to group them together. To me they are ""The Guyver"". Only after that I start thinking about the 3: Guyver- Out of Control, Guyver OVA, Guyver- The Bioboosted Armor.

This Guyver DVD (along with a volume 2) are the complete OVA. Again I have trouble picking a favorite, but I can tell you there is an area where this one stands apart. This is likely the most gory, bloody action style of all three anime with the Guyver name. As the first anime alot of fans saw, it shocked them by how far it's violence would go, and taught you about the difference between animation and anime. I wonder why it seems the new version doesn't go as far (Not really a complaint, but it is noticeable). The newest series was called ""the next level of ultra-violence"", but comparing them I really wonder.

Sho Fukamatchi is a kid who happened into the Guyver weapon, and since then hunted for it. That's really all you need to know, except that you should get this if you are any kind of real fan of anime. This one set a standard, and it's a lesser known beginning to anime in America. It's violent, and admired as anime you have to know.

The years since it came out have made it rare. So I would have to say used is the answer, not at all a negative. The DVDs are easily the highest quality to see the episodes for this older show, So jump on it! It made complete sense to buy used for this one!",1312243200,2,1483,4.196491228070175
