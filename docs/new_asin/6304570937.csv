7874601,3,6304570937,"This is a story of three lifelong friends who spend a night with a promiscuous woman who later has an accident and tries to avoid having her family find out about her promiscuity by falsely accusing the men of raping  her.  Sounds weird?  Yes, this is a somewhat odd movie.  It mixes drama and  comedy and tackles moral questions.  It works for the most part.  Trust me,  it's more interesting than my plot summary!",933638400,,415,4.513513513513513
