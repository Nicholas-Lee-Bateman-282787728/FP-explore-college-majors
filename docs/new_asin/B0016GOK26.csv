8262302,3,B0016GOK26,"Something I have come to really like about Indian Bollywood movie is their sometimes unbridled ability to handle the bitter truth as it really is, and to portray India's society as it really is, and to uncover the most grotesque and hidden features, rather than a fantastical whim of dreamers.

Dr. Vijay Verma is an outspoken protector of rights in a village, against the oppression of poor people by the local village head. The lengths the village head and his 'cronies' to destroy , as well as the complete capitulation to any humanity and moral obligations to utter cowardice of the villagers, is TRULY SHOCKING. Even by Bollywood standards where corruption, injustice and assault are so common, this movie is a step beyond.

For a while Advocate Bharti Mathur appears as an almost unrealistic ray of hope to the depraved and destitute Verma family, who believe in law and justice and the rule of courts. However, the film shows that, ultimately, in a climate of corruption and abuse of power, courts are completely incapable of delivering justice. Such an honest film about the failings of India's social fabric is completely commendable.

The only draw back is the farcical ending where the heroes stir up 'The peoples court' - and the reason for a three and a half star rating as opposed to a four star rating. Brilliant acting throughout.",1385251200,,1346,4.868995633187773
