7818830,5,6301968956,"I saw Dixieland Droopy once a long time ago and liked it a lot. I looked for quite a while to find a copy because I didn't remember the name of the character or the cartoon. I was happy to finally find it on Amazon at a decent price. As a musician, I like the way it portrays the joy of a being musician and the fun of playing music. The story is good and the music is good. A real gem.",1131494400,,386,3.7195121951219514
7818831,4,6301968956,"Unquestionably Tex Avery's finest character was the perennially sad-eyed basset hound Droopy, voiced by Bill Thompson.  This compilation contains six of his cartoons.
Daredevil Droopy is a contest between Droopy and  MGM's resident bulldog Spike for the job of circus stuntman.  The gags come  in typically Avery-esque fas fury as Droopy bests Spike in every stunt from  motorcycling to high-wire walking.
Droopy's Double Trouble is the best of  the lot.  Here Droopy is shown in an upbeat mood for once, as he helps his  twin brother Drippy, who has the stength of Superman, get a job as  co-bulter for a vacationing millionaire.  This, though, gets visiting  moocher Spike in lots of double-take trouble.
Senor Droopy is a bullfight  cartoon highlighted by the short's ending - of Droopy sitting on the lap of  live-action star Lina Romay.
Dixieland Droopy is a complete change of  pace, as Droopy's endless playing of a dixieland album, and later  acquisition of dixieland flea Pee Wee Runt and his band, lead to a gig at  the Hollywood Bowl.
Three Little Pups parodies The Three Little Pigs,  with Daws Butler's Huckleberry Hounded wolf of a dogcatcher vowing to get  into television if his scheme to catch the pups backfires - so we see him  rotoscoped into a western show at the end.
The humor is fast paced  throughout.",955670400,6,1326,4.914027149321267
