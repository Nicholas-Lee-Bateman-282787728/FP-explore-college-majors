6078104,2,B00GICGEAE,"This is a made for TV SyFy original. When the President (Tom Everett Scott) gets shot down, he survives to team up with some computer hackers, a fireman, and a SETI scientist to save the world with great dialog like:

President: ""I'm President Sam Garcette and I need your to help to save the world.""
Hacker: ""Okay.""

The film is similar to the one it sounds like, only made cheaper and is less fun. The special effects is what is expected for SyFy. Only the SETI scientist with a modified speaker from a Deep Purple concert can kill the aliens...that and some thermonuclear devices.

6078133,4,B00GICGEAE,"Borrowing heavily from 'Independence Day' this film is a budget SyFy channel Saturday afternoon timewaster. But it's surprisingly watchable with lots of fair digital effects and a competent (if ridiculous) plot.

Basically, machines beneath the earth are being awakened by the arrival of their mother ship from somewhere out in deep space. And the day has to be saved by the US president, his brother, his son and a few other hangers-on. It's silly, but so was the original 'Independence Day'. Once the scene is set and the introductions made at the start of the film things speed up quite quickly and the pace is kept up from that point. The invading machines get a lot of screen time however we never learn too much about who the aliens are or why they are planning on invading the earth.

At the end of the day, this film just wants to sweep you along with a lot of special effects and fun plot with a number of reasonably likable characters. And it does this quite well. And fortunately there isn't a lot of cheesy romance that SyFy movies tend to gravitate to. I thought this film was lots of fun.",1470960000,3,1102,4.532663316582915

It's got a little bit of everything, hackers, SETI scientist, teenagers, and mechnanoid aliens. The alien drones remind me of the shredders from the Battleship movie. Special effects were excellent, the main actors did a good job. I would recommend this movie. About the only thing I didn't like about this movie was the last 20 seconds of it, and that the Incidental background music was a bit to heavy in spots.",1467504000,,556,4.742268041237113

6078140,5,B00GICGEAE,"One of SciFi Channel's clear ripoffs of good scifi films which means of course that it absolutely, positively, has NO business.........being rated bad, in this case. This film is surprisingly well made but yes, it combines effects and stuff like spaceships, storylines, and other things to make a mashup of several movies including Independence Day, War of the Worlds, and Battleship. The name and DVD cover alone shows a copy of Independence Day. The way they finally destroy the invasion is also VERY similar. The ships carrying the ""flying razor saw balls"" like on Battleship were buried underground and mining Earth to become toxic to humans much like War of the Worlds. Even though this is clearly a borderline infringement on about three different franchises this movie is actually VERY well made for a TV movie. PG-13 for war like violence. Surprise!

Remember people that this a disaster movie and the lines between fact and fiction become blurred and disappear all together. For a SyFy TV movie I thought the acting and story line were good. The special were surprisingly pretty good. Others will tear this film apart nit picking what could have done different, let them. This is what if story done quit well on a TV budget and not a Theater size mega size bottomless budget. The way Independence Day-Saster ended showing the aliens are not giving up to soon tells me that there may be a sequel at some time such as the original Independence Day now has a sequel in the works.

Folks, with a title like ""INDEPENDENCE DAY-Saster"", you should be careful NOT to bite your tongue...while it's in-cheek!

If any aliens were involved, they weren't shown (unless they were hiding on the mother ship).  The damage is done by drones.
The world suffers much destruction (hearsay, it's never shown, just mentioned in passing).  The president (Tom Everett Scott) is in a chopper when the assault happens.  He crashes and manages to be the only survivor.  Likewise, his son is in a caravan of secret service vehicles and somehow the only survivors are three teens.  So it's up to a SETI expert, a fireman (Ryan Merriman), a clutch of hackers, and a couple of teens to defeat the evil aliens and survive the stupidity of a cravenly power hungry vice president (Garwin Sanford) who can't do anything right.
Naturally, this all takes place on the 4th of July.

I liked that they didn't bother to gussy it up with humor, that they played it super serious, like any of this made sense.  It was done on the cheap, quickly, and in Canada.  No one in the cast really stands out.  Everything about it screams perfunctory, getting by with the least amount of exertion.  It is a doggedly dim-witted idea.  It's obvious that they were simply trying to capitalize on better sci-fi efforts.  Still, there is something indefinable about it that I liked.

6078216,3,B00GICGEAE,"Its early afternoon on the Fourth of July. Youve already grilled out and ate lunch with the family. While you were going in and out of the house, you watched the one movie that is an absolute must for the holiday. Everyone knows Independence Day is required viewing on this great patriotic day of celebration. What do you do after the credits roll on Roland Emmerichs blockbuster gem? Anchor Bay and SyFy Channel answer that nagging question with their release of Independence Daysaster.

An alien invasion strikes the Earth from above and below on the birthday of the United States. The President is on his way to his hometown festivities when his helicopter is knocked out of the sky by one of the intergalactic enemys ships. After meeting up with his son and a group of survivors, he must lead them to safety and discover a way to stop the imminent destruction of the entire planet.

Independence Daysaster is a combination of every alien invasion film youve ever seen. They come from the sky and under the Earth just like in War of the Worlds. We discover their goal is to wipe out humanity and terraforming the planet like in The Arrival. I think the description above makes it obvious how it compares to Independence Day. If you're wondering if theres anything original about the film at all, I give you a resounding no.

The good thing about Independence Daysaster is that its clean fun for the whole family. Theres no over-the-top gore or bloodshed. People get smashed and sucked up, but there are never any graphic mutilations or decapitations seen onscreen. Its just old-fashioned PG-rated disaster movie mayhem and relatively inoffensive as far as language is concerned.

The cast of ""Independence Daysaster"" is made up of familiar TV stars and supporting actors. Tom Everett Scott is present from ""That Thing You Do"" and ""An American Werewolf in Paris."" Andrea Brooks of ""Supernatural"" plays a teenager in love with physics. ""Pretty Little Liars"" villain Ryan Merriman gets to embrace the good as a heroic fireman.

Notice I didn't use the descriptive word good before clean fun or old-fashioned? Thats because I wouldnt consider this flick to be necessarily good either as an actual feature film or a so-bad-its-good B-movie. It takes itself way too seriously to be lampooned and isn't engaging enough to hold your attention past the casual look up every minute or so while flipping through Facebook on your cell phone. However, Independence Daysaster can provide some light entertainment if you're looking for something to help pass the time between lunch and dinner or before heading out to watch fireworks.",1404518400,,2622,4.923076923076923

6078224,2,B00GICGEAE,"Decent special effects and acting can't save the dopey tediousness of this made-for-TV sci-fi actioner that's ultimately done in by a clumsy plot and the worst title ever given a film, ever, ever.

Despite the obvious comparison to the big-budget ""Independence Day"" of more than a decade prior, the only similarity between that blockbuster and this DTV nonsense is the alien-invasion story and the ridiculously convenient and inane deus ex machina plot devices that let our heroes save the day.

Otherwise, this one is about aliens who decide to terraform the earth, using giant, robotic phalluses that burst out of the ground, and flying, spherical drones that protect a mother ship that emerges  suddenly!  from behind the moon.

That's all we get.

A ragtag group of nerds, teenagers and the president of the United States (!), team up to save the world. And it's a good thing they do, because this is one of those movies in which the only people who exist in the world are those with speaking parts. It's like the filmmakers spend so much money on special effects, they can't afford to pay an extra or two to stand in the background to at least make the town that's getting destroyed by alien robot drones look somewhat populated.

Tom Everett Scott from ""That Thing You Do,"" the only player of note in this drivel, has matured into a handsome and confident actor who needs to fire his agent, and hire one who can talk him out of idiotic films like this one, ""Santa Paws 2"" and ""Mars Needs Moms."" Seriously, dude's got some chops. There's gotta be a ""Law & Order"" or ""CSI"" franchise for this guy somewhere.

Most of the other actors in this movie, surprisingly, give it all they've got. I mean, once their agent sent them a script that said ""Independence Daysaster"" on the cover, they should have been expected to phone it in. But these little nobodies act their little nobody hearts out, and it's so charming.

Not charming enough, however, to make this a good movie, or one worth recommending you spend 90 minutes of your life with. Despite everyone's good intentions, ""Independence Daysaster"" is a disaster.",1393113600,20,2114,4.754098360655738
