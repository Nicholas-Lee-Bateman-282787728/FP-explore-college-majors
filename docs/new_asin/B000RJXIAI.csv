8201099,2,B000RJXIAI,"""Broken Dagger"" was a ""made for TV"" documentary for The Learning Channel, directed by Bruce Burgess, and is of another era that we can no longer relate to, after having witnessed 2 great disasters, 9/11 and Katrina, and having seen how ill prepared we were for both. Made during the last year of the Clinton administration, there is sometimes a false feeling of security portrayed, especially when Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, Director of Mass Destruction Preparedness, National Security Council, is being interviewed. Other people interviewed include James Woolsey, who throws some bright light on the subject, and Rep. Curt Weldon, who though at times is sensible, also repeats statements that can't be verified, made by a Russian that is hard to track down, and that becomes ""conspiracy theory"" fodder.

Though there are brief clips of the Oklahoma bombing, a car bomb in London, the gas attack in a Tokyo subway, and the Centennial Park bombing in Atlanta, the bulk of this film is spent on training exercises for first responders, and though I'm glad they are becoming experts, the play acting portions of their training makes for absolutely dismal viewing. It is also shown that if there was a WMD attack in a stadium for instance, it would take 4 or 5 hours for the first responders to arrive in their chemical suits, and take care of the lethal situation. One has to wonder what would happen while waiting. Fortunately I only spent $1.00 for this film at the local discount store, which perhaps could have been better spent.",1190160000,2,1524,4.929961089494164
8201100,5,B000RJXIAI,"In this thrilling documentary, filmmaker Bruce Burgess examines the continuing evolution of global terrorism. Focusing on various aspects of terrorism, including different types of attacks, a government's preparedness for such attacks, as well as new preventative measures against them, this in-depth film is as thrilling as it is informative.

 Filmed before the events of September 11, 2001, the film's subject matter has become the hot-button issue of today's world. Firing on all cylinders, Burgess spares nobody as he uncovers the secrets that the media and government will not share.

With its depiction of some of recent history's most horrifying events, Broken Dagger is not for the Faint-of Heart, but is a necessary piece of information for anyone interested in staying on top of one of today's most important, and controversial, issues.
