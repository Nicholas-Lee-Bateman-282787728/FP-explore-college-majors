8511205,2,B0076YFJ72,"This DVD was not what I thought it would be. I love watching the Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures and Paranormal Witness but I was a bit disappointed in this DVD.",1424822400,,161,4.4
8511206,1,B0076YFJ72,"The DVD consists of 3 episodes or discs. The first episode plays ominous music and shows us the back of a one dollar bill. Pretty scary and convincing stuff. WE then spend the next half hour talking about York, England as they take a medium who looks like a bus driver to haunted building. In the bedroom the medium closes his eyes and says he can sense.....a bed!!! After spending a half hour discussing ghosts are part of the universal conscienceless, and their appearance is only an image we can't talk to. After that the hold a seance in order to try to contact the spirit.

The second DVD involves a spirit in a pub. Again they push the glass around and ask the spirit questions about him having sex with a dead girl, hence the indecent language and sexual content.

The third DVD is about ""Scotland's most haunted and secret bunker from the second world war."" It is a secret bunker that is open to the public and it was for an atom bomb attack, something that would have happened after WWII using fifth grade chronological logic. While interesting, there were nary a mention of a ghost. Now the cute blond girl doing the interview, apparently from England was a bit confused about that darn metric system.

Unless you are a Cold War junkie, the features are a laugh and a waste of money. If there are no ghosts, just say there are ""no ghosts.""",1423526400,,1349,4.475609756097561
8511207,4,B0076YFJ72,I got this set of dvds for my birthday this year and must say it was an excellent present. This is for the true believers and those who want the pants scared off them.,1358208000,,167,3.9411764705882355
8511208,3,B0076YFJ72,"These discs are very entertaining, but at four hours, maybe too much of a good thing.  There's something going on here, perhaps just an elaborate hoax, but nicely told at any rate.  If you're interested in seeing some real sances, this is the place.

The first disc is really two parts, the first an extensive interview, the second a seance...maybe...at a location in York.

Disc 2 follows the same structure: a traditional documentary, with interviews of a number of researchers into the paranormal, then a journey and seance at the site: in this case, a pub in Salterforth.

The 3rd disc is about a decommissioned nuclear bomb-shelter in Scotland, once top secret, now open to the public.  It's suitably creepy, with full-sized mannequin's ""living"" there.  A terrific location for a horror film.",1341878400,,797,4.992424242424242
