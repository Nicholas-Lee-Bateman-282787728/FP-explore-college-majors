6821776,5,B00PULRDJU,"Criterion has just released a Blu-ray Disc of ""Satyricon"" with all sorts of extras. Though not my favorite Fellini movie (by a wide margin), this package is interesting.

For starts, it includes the documentary ""Ciao Federico"" which was shot on the set of Satyricon as it was being filmed. When I worked as a projectionist in college I showed this movie a dozen times, but I've never seen it anywhere since. It's fascinating, because the documentarian was given unrestricted access to Fellini as he worked. It shows the humor and the anger of the actors and crew, it shows Fellini bullying his carpenters and berating the actors, as well as tenderizing them.  It shows his process of working, warts and all, and gives unprecedented insight into one of the trade's great directors.

Elsewhere on the two discs are interviews with people who worked on the film. One was a young photographer who was given unlimited access to the set, and an assistant (of some unknown job title) who seems to have been mostly a go-fer.

Satyricon was apparently one of the first films in history where documenting the process of making the film was given as high a priority as finishing the film. For a director like Fellini, who was a very seat-of-the-pants director, prone to change the entire day's schedule the night before, it was a gutsy thing to do. He is seen wearing an early lavalier microphone throughout the candid on-set footage, and apparently recorded everything he said or thought throughout the process.

Other films -- Apocalypse Now, Fitzcarraldo -- had had feature length movies made on the making of these films, but none documented the process from the director's point of view.

The Blu-ray transfer here is no great shakes.  There is no apparent improvement over the standard DVD I've had for years.  The sound is clear and noise-free but it's the extras which make this package.",1426032000,3,1884,4.865625
6821777,5,B00PULRDJU,"""...even Venus was cross-eyed.""

A very common symptom of viewing a Fellini picture is a sense of losing touch with reality. And it's quite fun! But halfway through the film, one does literally feel a surge of surreal ambiance. The actors here are just too good, and the colors and settings and costumes are superb. You could call FELLINI SATYRICON a historic moment in cinema's upbringing.",1425254400,3,390,4.909090909090909

6821779,5,B00PULRDJU,Stunning restoration of dazzling Fellini spectacle!  Picture quality superb!  Not for the kiddies--- or the unimaginative!,1424908800,5,122,6.5625
6821780,5,B00PULRDJU,"I understand how this film divides Fellini and cinema fans but that is part of the nature of the film, it is a very intentionally alienating and provocative.  I fall squarely in the ""love it"" camp, it's a breathtaking vision that, while set in 1 A.D Rome, seems to be a document of no civilization or society that ever existed, it is purely Fellini's world.  The new Criterion Blu-ray release looks and sounds beautiful, it truly provides the treatment the vivid sets, costumes, make up and soundtrack this otherworldly film deserves; highly recommend to any fan of this Fellini classic.",1424822400,8,587,4.86
6821781,3,B00PULRDJU,"I love Fellinis Satyricon; to my eye it is the most visually opulent and imaginative of all of his films, a riot of color and texture, an orgy of provocative and disturbingly dreamy images. So I was delighted to see that it was finally being released on Blu-ray, and by Criterion, no less. Loaded with extras, the release gives us a beautifully detailed reproduction of Fellinis canvas, and for that I am thankful.

What I am not thankful for, however, is the treatment of subtitles and language options (or a lack thereof). Its highly disappointing that Criterion didn't bother to include the English-language dubbed soundtrack that is available on the earlier DVD release from MGM Home Entertainment. Im sure that many foreign-language film aficionados, for whom an English dubbed version is anathema, find the original language version superior, and I must say that I have encountered far too many horrible English language dubs out there. But there are several circumstances that argue strongly for one in this case. First, keep in mind that ALL versions of Satyriconand the overwhelming majority of Italian films in generalare dubbed in post-production, even for the Italian-language version. Thats how Italian film studios have made movies for most of the past century; soundtracks were not recorded during the actual filming. (Producer Walter Wanger wrote insightfully about the trials faced during filming of the 20th Century Fox epic Cleopatra at Cinecitta studios in Rome; countless shots were ruined because of noise generated by the crew members, who were not accustomed to remaining silent during filming.) So in this, Satyricon is no worse than any other Fellini film. But what is disconcerting in this case, is that the three leads are all English-speaking actors: Martin Potter (Encolpio) and Max Born (Gitone) are English by birth, while Hiram Keller (Ascilto) is American. And it is totally evident, even glaringly obvious, that they are speaking their lines in English. So you have the discomforting experience of seeing them mouth the words that you are reading in the English subtitles while hearing other actors altogether voicing Italian dialogue that may or may not be close to what they are actually saying.

I read once that Fellinis original intention was to have the movie dubbed into Latin or some other dead language, so that everyone, regardless of nationality, would be forced to read the subtitles, as he wanted to emphasize a disconnect between the viewer and the ancient mythological world he was trying to create. Obviously he did not adhere to his original intention, however, as the film was shown in theaters and released on Blu-ray by Criterion with a dubbed Italian soundtrack.

Making it worse is the fact that the subtitles are large and superimposed upon the film imageand those images are of paramount importance in a psychedelic dreamscape such as Fellini as concocted here. That may be how the subtitles appear in theaters, but at home the picture, even on a widescreen TV, is letterboxed, and those same subtitles could have been relegated to the black portion at the bottom of the screen, without disrupting the visual impact of those superb pictures. Im surprised no one thought of doing that here.

Otherwise, the quality of the release is uniformly excellent. Apparently Criterion giveth, and Criterion taketh away.",1424822400,34,3367,5.138686131386861
6821782,5,B00PULRDJU,"I just read that somebody called this release ""flat"".  Considering that the Criterion blu ray has not yet been released, I assume the writer was referring to Fellini's own release of the film, which is ANYTHING but flat!  Nor is it even remotely homophobic.  In fact, there is a tender love scene between two men, as well as Fellini's more typically comic scenes of pan-sexual bizarre human behavior.  Be that as it may, this is not a film about homosexuality, or at least I don't see it as such;  for me it's a film about the churning waves of life, and, like so many of Fellini's best films, it's kind of impossible to say just exactly what this film is all about.  All I know is it has moved me aesthetically, it has mystified me, entertained me, freaked me out, excited me, and stuck with me for the last 25 years since I first saw it.  And as I get older, and have experienced more of the ups and downs of life it rings even more true.  It's a brilliant, vivid and very strange journey Fellini takes us on, filled with color, sound and strange rhythms.  A masterpiece.",1419033600,45,1073,4.378787878787879
6821783,2,B00PULRDJU,"A book about the film that included outtakes was published not long after the movie appeared in theaters.  It included photos from deleted scenes that would have conveyed the gay spirit of the book, which was more comical than grotesque or horrible; the boy of everyone's desire controls his fans by threatening to amputate his own penis if people do not do what he wants, which would have been an intolerable loss to multitudes.
Nothing like that appears in this very flat and disappointing film.
If someone discovers that this BD release includes never before seen footage (and cleavage), then maybe it would be worthwhile to own.",1418947200,7,632,4.906542056074766

6821799,5,B00PULRDJU,"I'm trying to expose myself to the great international directors and this film sounded like a good first Fellini because the plot and idea behind it seemed so intriguing. I am not disappointed. So impressed..,the colors, the costumes, the sets, the mystery, the world he creates for the viewer is so unique...its all so surreal and a complete trip from beginning to end. I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I've watched it 5 times in the week since I've owned it and every time I feel like I see something new or form a new idea or opinion about what I'm experiencing. Fellini has hooked me with this one. I am scrambling to purchase every Fellini Blu-ray I can find.",1444867200,,668,4.483606557377049
6821800,5,B00PULRDJU,"Oh, i was just so wonderfully excited when i was informed that this visual extravaganza,one of Fellini's most famous, and, daring movies, was in fact getting the ""Criterion's treatment""! What a perfect choice: this time, Fellini goes wild telling of Rome at its rowdy ancient times, with a formidable, and visionary reconstruction, perfectly served by the 'maestro', who doesn't worry about the budget, obviously, but creates, and, invents segments , that are truly art in motion and become a feast  for the eyes composed of exquisitely presented, designed, and photographed beauty! This is a movie that is truly one of a kind, thanks also to the contributions of an excellent, ensemble work from a first class international cast, and crew: they achieve such visuals and momentum, sometime you'd think to be watching a master's painting instead, it's that kind of luxury fascinating all audiences with the most beautiful, and vibrant colors, just stunning to look at ! And, there's hardly a dull moment in ""Satyricorn"": it is a delightful, and never less than compelling, Art Film you get to watch, and to taste, almost as if it was a very fine wine,  as intoxicating as it is highly dreamy. A cast of a thousand faces helps the show to take off, too, while Martin Potter and Hiram Keller,  are quite unforgettable, as the two lead characters who never seem afraid to live in the moment some of the most outrageous parties the days had to offer, but you realize soon they are tragically lost, always looking for something that isn't  clearly there: they are two adventurous young men open to all what life has to offer, but, ultimately, missing love and communion, faith and hope. After all they are portrayed as icons of the most exuberant, and most decadent days of  the fierce Roman Empire and of its greedy and deceitful society who does never stop wanting more and more, ignoring others, and rarely giving or caring, as they are selfishly way too engaged in facing the present, to be able to worry about the future! They live on, spending all the strength and wealth, brought by the power, to exhaustion, and, without remorse, but,  actually, almost consuming themselves through an array of increasingly incessant, mysterious, isolating functions, often enforcing cruel mores and laws, while a perpetuating restlessness and its visible lack of justice and sensibility, often it's haunting the narration as an omen hinting to this insane living at the search of the ultimate pleasure, as a darker sensation that is obviously suggesting the advent of much less lavish and carefree days ahead! The harrowing wild crowd however seems way too addicted to the luxury, and to a somewhat sick and insatiable desire for whatever they can get a kick out of living, to be able to expect, or even to care for the end of their foolish run. Fellini is excellent indeed in recreating that world with all of its damnation, greed, and despair that eventually will take the Empire to its ruinous fall. And, i will add that Criterion delivers as usual, and this version of the movie is restored to be indeed a true spectacle, and a joy for the eyes. If you haven't seen this movie before, this is certainly the best way to see it today, and, if you already have seen it, instead, this is the opportunity for a second (or third ..) experience of this unique piece, one of the gems encrusting the work of outstanding genius director, and true master, Federico Fellini, a man who highly, and so successfully, contributed to change the movies and their art, revealing a whole new world of winning creation, amazing and arresting visuals, finding a whole new sense of the media and ways to modern storytelling.",1441584000,2,3691,4.8415213946117275

6821803,4,B00PULRDJU,The first part of this movie has a tenuous plot connection but the later part doesn't really make any sense. It reminds me a little of reading Finnegans Wake in that you float along in the beauty but eventually realize that nothing seems connected. This is a good movie for when you have a free afternoon and just want to stimulate the eyes. The two main characters are very beautiful and that kind of carries the movie. Not the best Fellini but not unwatchable either. Note: this is not the Satyricon with the scene where they discover a room which fades away once exposed.,1435104000,,574,4.528846153846154

6821814,4,B00PULRDJU,"""Satyricon"" (1969) is directed by Federico Fellini (Amacord, 8 1/2). This 130 minute film is remastered by Criterion in 4K resolution. The film is based on parts of Petronius's classical Roman satire. The original Petronius work consisted of 16 books of which only parts of three books are known now to exist. Fellini wished to represent this notion of fragmentation in the movie and he does so by showing glimpses here and there of Roman life without any real narrative or story. Fellini takes Petronius's realist work and fashions a surreal and rather grotesque view of Roman times that resembles a sort of freak show that speaks of an unknowable past.

As usual Criterion includes a wealth of special features, including a behind the scenes documentary, archival interviews with the director, as well as interviews with classicists Luca Canali  and an essay by film scholar Michael Wood.",1426118400,11,890,5.0476190476190474
8689250,4,B00PULRDJU,"I first became aware of this movie in the 1980s when a boyfriend tried to cajole me into seeing it. I had no interest back then, but because Ive become more interested in independent, experimental and foreign film, I decided to watch it. I couldn't find anywhere to rent or stream it, so I figured Id take a chance on buying it. Im glad that I did.

Fellini Satyricon is definitely a bizarre, surreal experience. The whole thing is rather dreamlike and contains a lot of sexual content. The sets are fantastic, the costumes are strange and the characters are largely tacky. The cinematography is sumptuous with images that are well composed and colors that really pop. It boasts a 4K digital restoration and looks amazing.

The biggest criticisms I have with regard to the movie is that its an exercise in style over substance, and the story often seems incoherent and non-linear. This is not a big problem for me, but an impatient viewer will never make it through the two hours in takes to conclude. Its a film that is probably more accessible to cineastes with an open mind than to the general public. An English dub would have been nice to make it more watchable, but thats a minor quibble. BUT, if you don't like subtitles, steer clear...

In addition to 130 minutes of surreal historical fantasy, there are a few special features as well...perhaps not as generous as Ive gotten used to with Criterion though. The few special features on this disc aren't terribly engaging; however, I found the documentary about Fellinis adaptation of Petronius work fascinating.

Im giving this release of Fellini Satyricon four stars. While I was impressed by the restoration and was entertained by the film, it is hard to follow and drags a bit at times. The special features, apart from the documentary, are just ok. If you're into Fellini, bizarre art films or Italian cinema, its a worthwhile purchase. If your tastes are more mainstream and modern, youll want to steer clear.",1518739200,3,1971,4.771260997067449
