8442222,5,B000E5KUTC,"The entire ""Becoming a Better Boxer"" series will jump-start your progress toward learning the fundamentals of boxing.  On my gym wall, we have a poster of Kenny Weldon's mantra:  ""Boxing is the art of hitting an opponent from the furthest distance away, exposing the least amount of your body while getting in position to punch with maximum leverage and not getting hit.""  Sounds simple, right?  But how do you do it against an opponent who moves away from you, who can punch faster than you can, is taller than you, or is just flat out a better boxer?  Answering those questions is like answering the question, ""How do I build a house?""  It takes years of training, experience, and trial-and-error to master the art of carpentry or of boxing.

But before you can even start on the path to mastery of carpentry, you have to learn to use a hammer, saw, and measuring tape.  In other words, you have to learn the fundamentals.  And before you can grow in boxing, you have to learn to punch, move, manage the ring, and train.  This video series is a great introduction to those concepts.",1375574400,,1084,4.598958333333333
