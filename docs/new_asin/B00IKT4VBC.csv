6281361,5,B00IKT4VBC,"I just finished watching The Normal Heart the other night, and this documentary was the most fulfilling film to follow it with- a documentary to really grasp how we fought back to raise awareness and change legislation.

Well put together, and lets us glimpse into that time period once more.",1404604800,4,292,4.84

6281363,5,B00IKT4VBC,"A history of Act Up, it astounded me on how little I knew not only about AIDs and HIV but how little I knew about the movements that took place. This film should be taught in classrooms for these reasons:

1)As a historical record of AIDs activism
2)An Introduction to LGBT health education
3)To teach Civil disobedience.
4)Queer people of all ages need to see representations of  queer people outside of the affluent gay white men that saturate the media.

I cannot express how emotionally moving I find United in Anger.  It's something that everyone needs to experience for themselves.",1399852800,9,587,4.84
6281364,5,B00IKT4VBC,"Based on oral history interviews and archival footage, this documentary tells the story of ACT UP - NY, the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power, the largest and most powerful grassroots AIDS activist organization in history. Many of them sick and dying, ordinary people take on an indifferent and increasingly conservative government as well as powerful pharmaceutical companies, and win life-saving treatments and a measure of dignity and respect. This film is a must-see for anyone interested in AIDS activism and grassroots people's activism in general. The next time you feel powerless against the forces of greed and bigotry, watch this movie!",1399334400,3,644,5.3861386138613865

6281369,5,B00IKT4VBC,"I lived in San Francisco during this time.  Many of my friends had either contracted AIDS or were committed to helping
in any way possible. I had 2 babies at home, plus work, which realistically limited my participation. However, I kept up with all
my friends who were fighting the disease and the government's silence. This documentary is wonderfully done.
It made the fight visible...some of my friends are in it!!",1437523200,,416,4.859154929577465
6281370,5,B00IKT4VBC,"A breathtakingty powerful walk through the 80's and 90's  when Act Up and other independent organizations took charge of the street demonstrations for AIDS victims and survivors.  I would recommend that EVERYONE watch it.  Lest we forget, may be remember.
Its a seminal piece of documentation.  So many on the film are now in the obituary column.  Lest we forget, we remember.",1432944000,2,376,5.0

6281375,5,B00IKT4VBC,"I saw How to Survive a Plague a few weeks ago and this is a perfect companion. I did not know about the struggle for women to get an AIDS diagnosis until ACT UP and others protested. I am so thankful that these people got together and made such a difference. For those that passed away in my fair city, New York is a sadder place without them, but a better place because of them.",1412726400,,379,4.066666666666666
8643140,5,B00IKT4VBC,I watched the documentary for class and was so upset and moved that I came over to Amazon to make sure the film was supported. I saw it free on YouTube and the director had commented that he didn't mind it being free because he wants people to know what their history is.,1493683200,,271,4.132075471698113

8643142,5,B00IKT4VBC,"A powerful documentary of the AIDS crisis. Several times during the film, I was in tears. It brought back so many memories of friends who have fought and died. Those were desperate times, and I am so proud of the people who fought the battle. To me, it is important that those people are not forgotten: what they did and the courage that they possessed. I want young people to know this this history. I cannot adequately express at this moment the power and inspiration from this documentary. I will watch is regularly to remember the beauty of those lives and the movement.",1471478400,,574,4.58252427184466

8643145,5,B00IKT4VBC,"This is a movie I'd watched (several times) on LinkTV and finally decided it had to be in my library.  Two things that impressed me about the film.  First, is how well it captured the intensity of the participants (they had real 'skin' in the 'game' and it shows) as well as looking at the tactics from the viewpoints of the 'leadership' (such as it was).  Very moving & engaging!  Second, and I'm not a movie-maker or aficionado of the movie-making 'craft' but even I was struck by the outstanding editing, choices of film clips, interviews, etc.  It's not just a great history lesson about the AIDS epidemic and our government's dystopic response to it, but it's a great lesson in movement-building and successful activism as well.  I think all activist leaders should watch it; especially those of the BLM movement.  It's a primer to success.",1461456000,2,845,4.7465753424657535

8643147,5,B00IKT4VBC,Superb history of activism during the AIDS epidemic. The documentary is fascinating as it shows some of the key ACT UP members in their youth and at present day being interviewed about the early years of the epidemic. The documentary highlights how they were fighting for their own lives and the lives of their friends. Great for use in teaching about the AIDS epidemic or in Queer Theory courses.,1453161600,,397,4.768115942028985
