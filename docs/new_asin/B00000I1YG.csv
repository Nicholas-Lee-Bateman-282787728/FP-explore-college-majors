7909240,5,B00000I1YG,"This video shows nine baby animals and each segment has kids singing the tune for that animal. It is an extremely well-produced video and a nice change from the usual kid videotapes. The cassette tape matches all 11 songs (beginning & ending songs & nine animal songs) and I agree that the songs are not Grammy winning material, but they are cute rhyming songs that the kids can happily sing along with! My 3 1/2 yr. old loves to sing with both video and audio tapes. We have had it for about a year and it is by far her favorite videotape & cassette.",978220800,3,551,4.3076923076923075
7909241,2,B00000I1YG,"When my toddler went into his ""moo"" ""woof"" ""quack"" stage, I wanted to get him a video which showed the animals and gave their sounds.  This video was a big disappointment.  There are less than 30 seconds of animal noises out of a half-hour video, and instead we are forced to listen to wooden, mechanical, forced rhymes, DUMB DUMB songs.  ""Uncle Larry's Farm, where the animals have such charms""  just an example.
Cute animals and pretty farm",972604800,3,442,4.701298701298701
7909242,5,B00000I1YG,"A tremendous fun film of precious baby animals that would appeal to every age.  The music, songs, and children's voices are outstanding. It's no wonder that this was an award winning video with ""Parenting""  magazine. It IS wonderful and I'm ordering more as gifts for family &  special friends.

7909243,5,B00000I1YG,"I watched ""Baby Animals at Uncle Larry's Farm"" and let me tell you, this thing is priceless. The kids LOVE it. I don't think I have ever seen a children's video so well-produced as this one. The original songs  are like Disney songs...and the video even comes with a cassette you can  use in the car. The songs don't drive us crazy after we've heard them a few  times, either. I HIGHLY recommend this film!",917481600,3,406,4.386666666666667
