2869603,2,B000RMT8JU,"I personally was disappointed with this show.  I like Mysteries, but some of these I didn't even understand.  There are sexual undertones and the younger brother acts like an immature jerk and girl crazy.  I still prefer The Hardy Boys & Nancy Drew Mystery Hour.  It's not silly and more of solving Mysteries.  I had no patience for this, it's as if the director and producer made a joke of this series.",1394150400,3,403,4.541666666666667
2869604,5,B000RMT8JU,This show is fun and funny. It is well written and interesting. The storylines make you want to watch all the episodes again and again.,1360022400,,135,4.44
2869605,5,B000RMT8JU,"A fast-paced, witty, and highly entertaining 1995 reboot of the Hardy Boys -- this is NOT the 1970s incarnation, and don't try to compare the two (and book canon nit-pickers, move along). I wish I'd caught this series when it was actually on the air, and I'm sorry I missed it. The writing's solid, the plots fast-moving, the characterizations and acting excellent.

Here, Frank's an investigative reporter, Joe's still in college, though he's a photographer and accomplished hacker. Their Dad's moved to Europe, leaving them the house, and the brothers get involved in all the mysteries that the town of Bayport can conjure. The 20 minutes format means that the writers can't set up anything too involved, but the adventures are fun, the humor is witty, dry, and to the point (as the brothers are ransacking Fenton's record collection: Joe: ""Maybe Dad didn't alphabetize them?""  Frank: ""Joe, Dad alphabetized the *spice rack*..."").

It's a joy to watch Grey and Popowich have such fun with the brother detectives. Paul Popowich, in particular, does an amazing take on Joe Hardy as a dry deadpan-snarker who has far too much a weakness for girls (the episode ""The Debt Collectors""/""All in the Family"" is a real tour-de-force there).  There's shout-outs to the 70s show (""Jazzman"" and ""Love Birds"", dear god), so keep your eyes and ears open.  I'd place Grey's & Popowich's portrayals of Frank and Joe Hardy as definitive, in the same way that David Suchet defined Poirot and Jeremy Brett, Holmes; the characterizations of the brothers are very much within the book canon, Joe as the impulsive intuitive one, Frank as the cooler brain. The actors have done their homework, and it shows.

It's a shame that this show only lasted one season -- I was sorry to come to the end of this DVD, and wanting more.  Pick this one up, grab a bowl of popcorn, and enjoy!",1325548800,2,1856,4.83596214511041
2869606,3,B000RMT8JU,"The Hardy Boys, and are fictional detectives in a long running series of mystery books, written under the pseudonym of Franklin W. Dixon, that were originally targeted at juvenile readers.  They featured teenaged brothers Frank and Joe, sons of private detective Fenton Hardy, attempting to follow in their father's footsteps.

This 1995 take on the classic sleuths, was produced by New Line Television in Canada, and lasted just one season, with thirteen half hour episodes.  Paul Popowich is Joe Hardy, and Colin K. Gray is older brother Frank, who works as a reporter for The Metropolitan Eagle, where Kate Craigen (Fiona Highet) was his boss.  With their father away in Europe, the boys operate from the family home in the town of Bayport, and often hangout at Dixon's restaurant (in homage to author Franklin W. Dixon).

Frank's job as a reporter, often leads to some interesting cases.  Unlike the 70's television series that starred Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson, this version of the Hardy Boys is not a vehicle for teen idols.  These Hardy's are a bit more serious and competent.  There is no singing in a band or surfing contests, and the brothers do not bumble around wide-eyed looking for clues, like the gang from Scooby Doo.  And true to character, they do not use weapons, or get into many fights.

The stories are mostly on the lighter side, not particularly violent or sophisticated, and there isn't always time for in depth story or character development.  Neither of the Hardy's has a girlfriend, but romance isn't part of the scene.  Most of the action is set in Bayport, but for a change of pace, in the final two episodes, the guys are in France, where they have a brief reunion with their father, and also meet Nancy Drew (Tracy Ryan) for the first time.  Ryan was starring as Nancy Drew in her own series for New Line Television (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nancy-Drew-1995-The-Complete-First-Season-Boxset/dp/B000RMT9FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nancy Drew (1995) - The Complete First Season (Boxset)</a>).

This mildly entertaining version of The Hardy Boys, is probably of interest only to diehard fans of the detectives.  The acting is competent enough, but the writing doesn't do a very good job of developing the characters of Frank and Joe, and their relationship with each other.  There isn't anything special here.  The image quality and sound quality of the fullscreen presentation is very good.  The episodes have chapter stops, but are not subtitled.",1283904000,3,2533,5.212345679012346
2869607,3,B000RMT8JU,"I love the Hardy Boys, I really do.  I loved the older series from the 70s.  The thing is that this series was not like the Hardy Boys at all!  It was entertaining, but it was not the Hardy Boys!  First of all, the ages are different.  Frank is 21 while Joe is 20.  Frank also works as a reporter, while Joe isn't given a career although he's known to be a computer hacker.  Joe loves girls, and in one of the episodes he has a very heavy kissing scene that is a little dirty.  One other thing that I disliked about this series was that there was bad language in nearly every episode!  This is definitely not a family show!  The good thing is that the little 24 minute episodes were entertaining.  Were they fabulous?  No, but they were very good considering that they were so short.  It's a good series, but it really isn't like the books at all.  I definitely recommend the older series from the 70s, but I suggest that you give this one a pass.",1262044800,25,947,4.188888888888889
2869608,4,B000RMT8JU,"No matter what shape a Hardy Boys adventure comes in, it is always a pleasure. Enough action, mystery, and male bonding to keep the die hard fan engaged, as well as convert the uninitiated viewer. Frank is an up and coming newspaper reporter...and as near as I can figure out Joe is a student (either that, or unemployed). Eagle eye'd watchers will notice a tip of the hat to ""author"" Franklin W. Dixon -- the restaurant that Frank and Joe frequent is called F.W. DIXON'S. And also a cameo of sorts by Shaun Cassidy (Joe in the 1970s verson) in the episode JAZZMAN. Frank and Joe are looking through boxes of old vinyl albums, and sticking out of one box is the Shaun Cassidy LP BORN LATE. A nice touch. Good cast, fairly well written stories, and innocent adventure that will be well shared between fathers, sons and (of course) brothers.",1261440000,2,839,4.562913907284768
2869609,5,B000RMT8JU,"Here is the Hardy Boys in their last television series this is the 1995 television series and it didn't last long cause it was cancelled after one season. So if you ever enjoyed the Hardy Boys no matter if it's from the Mickey Mouse Club or of the Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson fame or from the books themselves then this is an must for any fan and it's for any generation.

8201464,1,B000RMT8JU,I was looking for The Hardy Boys Shaun Cassidy Parker Stevenson this DVD box set of two totally different actors was very much a disappointment I did not enjoy it at all I think that a customer who orders DVDs that are the same but different actors should be notified these are two different DVD sets with different actors are these the ones you want or are you looking for ones that are with the same actors this did not give no notification and I am very disappointed,1504828800,,469,4.340909090909091
8201465,1,B000RMT8JU,"This is a low budget series from the 1990s that has little relationship to the books by Franklin W. Dixon or the popular 1970s American TV series.  Bayport is very recognizable as downtown Toronto, which reminded me of a very pleasant holiday to that lovely city in past years.  So yes, the locations were the highlight of the entire series for me.  Fans of the Hardy Boys will want to give this series a miss due to the dull and uninspiring scripts.",1489708800,2,450,4.463414634146342
8201466,1,B000RMT8JU,"Turned it off after 15 - 20 minutes.  It was embarrassingly stupid.  I can see why it didn't last.  Joe Hardy actually made me want to revoke all security clearances from any 20 year old heterosexual male.  At 20, Joe Hardy is already an experienced detective and shouldn't fall for tricks from a pretty girl that walks/drives by/breaks into his home.  I didn't see how the first episode ended because Joe pissed me off so much that I wanted him to get caught and go to prison for stupidity alone.  Then tack on 20 years for theft.  Even Frank, getting chewed out by his editor, doesn't even bother to explain his side.

I was ok with the idea that these are not the stories from the book, or that Frank and Joe are adults.  But I just can't handle stupid.",1475366400,2,756,4.3428571428571425

8201468,4,B000RMT8JU,"these are great! have been watching and watching these over and over!
though this series does have some inappropriate scenes, references, and parts of the plot lines, it over all is a pretty great show.

I have been seeing a lot of reviews that say 'NOT A FAMILY SHOW' well it's rated TV-PG so that means its not going to be that much of a family show, though I think it is actually just fine for older children.
(if your looking for a family show look for TV-Y-7 or TV-G)

I think that Colin Gray and Paul Popowich played a very convincing version of the Hardys and the hidden references to the 1970s series and to the books through out the show are great! I have spotted numerous ones and they are always fun to spot but look very closely because some are hidden very well..",1456531200,,776,4.308219178082192

Would definitely not recommend wasting the time and money on this.",1414195200,2,373,4.3428571428571425
