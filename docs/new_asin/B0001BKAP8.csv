1986239,4,B0001BKAP8,"I saw this when it first came on in 1977 when I was 13. Surprising how much I remember these skits. Overall, while it's unique, it's certainly a mixed bag. Like the Smothers brothers, it's quite daring and not surprising that it had trouble with the censors.
""The Richard Pryor Special?"" is clearly the best of the lot. Basically, it's Pryor trying to get to his show and meeting strange characters with varied skit ideas along the way. Some really good stuff like the young children's choir (with future soap star Kristoff St. John) and the drunk lover performance with Maya Angelou.
A lot of the ideas that Pryor brings to the fore are unique, but some are just plain strange, such as the ""Pet head"" with Charles Fleischer (later Roger Rabbit) and ""Black Death"", a bizzare goth-rocker who kills all of his fans during a concert (this freaked me out and puzzled me in 1977 and still does today). Much of this humor is based on race relations and the subject gets sort of beaten in the ground after a while.
The edited skits makes one wonder why Pryor filmed such profanity-filled routines knowing that they had no chance of airing (there is a particularly foul moment when Pryor curses heavily during the Audience Q&A when there are clearly children visible in the audience). As he has admitted, Pryor had a bad cocaine habit in those days and it shows in some of these monologues.
However, it's also interesting to see the cast of soon-to-be's such as a very young and glamourous pre-""Night Court"" Masrha Warfield, Robin Williams, Sandra Bernhard, John Witherspoon, Paul Mooney, and Tim Reid. So overall, you can see in this the direction Black comedy was to take from the 1980s into recent times.
It would be nice if ""A Time For Laughter,"" the 1967 special that featured a young Pryor with Redd Foxx, Moms Mabley, Pigmeat Markham, and Godfrey Cambridge, would also make it to DVD as that was equally as ground-breaking.",1081555200,39,1922,4.706231454005935
1986240,5,B0001BKAP8,"Richard was titled, at that time, the best comic ever. What a lot of folks didn't realize, was Richard was waaay before his time.

1986241,5,B0001BKAP8,"BUY this DVD today.  Be sure to purchase the boxset as it is the only way to get the RICHARD PRYOR SPECIAL? and Mudbone bonus footage.  This groundbreaking series paved the way for not only (the obvious) IN LIVING COLOR and CHAPPELLES SHOW, but other subversive TV like South Park which attempt to inject social commentary while challenging the censors.  It not only captures Pryor at his comedic peak, but gives us early glimpses of folks like Robin Williams, Sandra Berhard, Marsha Warfield and John Witherspoon.  This show has never been available on home video and has basically been out of circulation since its initial run, thus it is a jewel to behold.  Watching Pryor as ""The ""Mojo"", ""the First Black President"" and ""Rev. White""--who has his own way to drum up ""the big bucks""-- will have you laffing for hours.  But  Pryor also presents scketches that weren't designed to be laugh out loud funny, but challenge you in other ways, like the wino sketch that turns into a Maya Angelo performance. Or the ""Satin Doll""  sketch, which has no laughs at all, but aims to capture the feeling of post WWII Black america with a fantastic song-and-dance number starring Paula Kelly (choreographed by Michael Peters.)  I seriously doubt these five hours of television would have come out the same if the NBC censors had been completely undertanding, sensitive and supportive of Mr. Pryor's vision.  The Special is an extension of Mr. Pryor's hosting of SNL. The  subsequent series itself reminds me of Marvin Gaye's HERE, MY DEAR. While it is not Marvin's most listenable or even best work, through pain he finds beauty and truth.  This boxset is a must-have for fans of TV comedy and shoud be copped by any means necessary.",1081123200,7,1720,4.812925170068027
1986242,4,B0001BKAP8,"Richard Pryor ready for prime time? I would say the answer is yes and no after watching these three DVDs that cover all four of 1977's THE RICHARD PRYOR SHOW series, THE RICHARD PRYOR SPECIAL? that preceeded the series (which aired earlier that year), plus various outtakes and other unreleased footage.
The special is a classic comedy hour, with the likes of the Idi Amin Dada segment, the appearance by the Pips sans Gladys Knight, and a priceless skit with Richard and Maya Angelou which perfectly symbolizes how Pryor's approach to comedy may have had a wild, profane surface, but look underneath and you find wry insight and emotive depth that is missing from most of those comics whom he influenced.  A rainbow-coalition-like segment with kids singing a Stevie Wonder classic was unique in its era, as was the ""Harlem Sweeties"" clip featuring a variety of women of color ... six years prior to Vanessa Williams becoming the first black Miss America.
As for the series, things got off on the wrong foot when Pryor's classic ""nude"" opening segment to the first show was a no-go (it is seen here).  Pryor spent much of the four shows getting skit-ready versions of certain aspects of his standup act past censors.  No cussing, but pushing the prime time envelope nonetheless.  Frankly, a few skits don't work i.m.o. (Mojo The Healer, the Black Death heavy metal music skit), but more often than not the segments are funny and stand the test of time very well (40th president, for one).  The supporting cast are seen in spots, but if you are a fan of Robin Williams for one, you may be disappointed by how little he is seen on camera.
Among the extras are a lengthy, definitely not ready for prime time monologue (mostly Pryor as Mudbone), filmed before a small studio audience (the content is similar to his concert films).  Then watch the unedited 40+ minute no-holds-barred Roast including Pryor and the cast members and compare it to the severely abridged footage on the fourth show to see what cutting-and-pasting had to be done to find comments appropriate for a network tv show (in fact, Pryor's comments are entirely missing from the broadcast, for obvious reasons).
There's a fair amount of political incorrectness in the material presented here (particularly in the non-broadcasted footage), controversial by today's standards as well as 1977's.  If you can handle that, plus the fact that some segments work better than others, you will find that this DVD set may not present Pryor at his all-time best, but there's enough of his comic genius on display to make this an important historical document that at times maintains an edge even by contemporary standards.",1080518400,32,2676,4.881057268722467

1986287,4,B0001BKAP8,"Richard Pryor was ready for prime time, but the NBC censors were not ready for Pryor  hence the unevenness of his notoriously brief comedy-variety series. Nevertheless, ""The Richard Pryor Show"" (1977) was a groundbreaking program that delved into provocative territory. Pryor wasn't always going for laughs when he explored topics such as gun control, lesbianism and racial tension. Despite the hit-and-miss nature of the four completed episodes, the best sketches (""Star Wars Bar,"" ""The 40th President"" and ""Titanic"") remain classics. In retrospect, it's amazing that Pryor won some of his battles with the censors, though not enough to save the already-doomed show. Along with previously unseen outtakes and deleted routines (all uncensored), the DVD set includes ""The Richard Pryor Special?""   a critical and ratings hit that encouraged NBC to green-light the comedian's short-but-bittersweet network run. ""The show was no vanilla milkshake,"" Pryor recalled in his 1995 autobiography. ""I'm proud of the effort.""",1344988800,,1014,5.657894736842105

But also sad because so many of the pro and con critics of Pryor cannot see him as anything other than a ""Black Comedian or Artist"".  He's not.  He is a Comedian who happens to be African-American.  This show more than his routines and his movies shows the incredible range and knowledge of Mr. Pryor.  He clearly wanted to tell us something within the context of comedy.  And at the same time, he knew that didactic techniques could never supersede the laughs.  I call him the ""prince"" of comedy because he had the same problem as Prince the musician.  Prince ultimately is a rock musician...the way Sly Stone was a rock musician.  And they should always be in that pantheon.  Pryor was in the tight circle of superstar comedians -- Martin, Kaufmann.

I recommend his later work that was not controlled by TV censors.
This is a nostagic look back and nothing more. It was interesting to see the young faces and developing talent of some of the cast members.
The most entertaining part was the ""roast"" and you can see that on YouTube.",1229817600,4,567,4.623762376237623
1986291,3,B0001BKAP8,"There's no mystery as to why The Richard Pryor Show only lasted four episodes. True, Pryor only originally contracted to do ten shows, and then renegotiated down to four once he realized that the NBC censors weren't going to let him do much of the material he wanted to do. But even though he had limited the run of the show himself, there is no doubt that the series wouldn't have lasted much more than four even if it had been intended to run a full season.  Plainly put--the first two episodes sucked and by the time the excellent fourth episode hit the air, whatever audience there had been was gone. There were some bright spots in the early episodes, and though they were very bright indeed they were surrounded by pure pointless, rambling, drawn out crap.  Then, suddenly, in the fourth episode--magic. But too late.

It could be that so many of Pryor and company's skits were rejected by the censors in the earlier episodes that the remaining bits had to be elongated beyond their potential or that skits were included that otherwise would have been left on the cutting room floor.
The majority of the sketches in those episodes are very old fashioned and seem distinctly un-Pryorlike--a lot of pantomime and dumb visual humor.  I guess it could be that Pryor was a big Ernie Kovacs fan; a lot of the comedy resembles that stuff. In any case, the urban characters and situations that so vividly populated Pryor's standup routines were almost entirely absent from his variety show. The more I watch the DVD release of the show, however, the more I begin to think that the Richard Pryor Show was actually started as the man's big ""FU"" to the network. For instance, the show's theme was ""For the Love of Money"" indicating Pryor's admission that he was only in it for the dough and he did make many references to being creatively hog-tied and enslaved by the network. And, whether on purpose or not--the low quality of the comedy of the first shows was insulting to everyone.

Though the majority of the show's early skits and bits were determinedly dumb, there were still some bits that were good and a very few that made for extraordinary television. And the series got  better as it went along. In fact, by the fourth and final episode the consistency and quality of the show improved so much that it is obvious that Rich and company had made a conscious decision to expend less effort in flipping off the network and more in trying to do something worthwhile within the constraints they had.

Here's a rundown of the good parts of the series:

First episode: poor--two and a half good parts
-The opening shows a close up of Pryor telling the audience that they need not worry that the network censors have tamed his comedy at all. In fact, he points out as the camera pulls back to a longer shot ""as you can see, I'm naked."" Then, as the camera pulls back to a long shot he says ""and as you can see, I've given up nothing!"" The long shot reveals a naked Pryor with no genitals, like a black Ken doll.
-The 40th President of the United States skit, about the first black president, is very slow to start, but eventually builds to funny stuff worthy of Pryor.
-- a dramatic piece about a singer names Satin Doll
--the other 6 or so segments of the show are a waste of time

Second Episode: Really bad--only one half-good bit.
--A sketch satirizing the To Kill a Mockingbird trial scene with Pryor as a bigoted white lawyer has some funny bits.
--and that's it. The rest of the episode sucks.

Third Episode: Improved--half brilliant, half sucky
--This episode opens with a brilliant bit in which the Network turns the sound down on a violent Pryor rant about how they're ruining his show as a voiceover tells us he's saying nice, glowing things about working for NBC. Truly hilarious.
--Richard does some of his clean standup bits (one bleep) that are very funny. What's even funnier is that the segment seems totally out of place in the show's format up to that point and was obviously stuck in out of a desire to actually give the audience some entertainment value. This episode actually seems to be a bit of a turning point for the series.
--A incredibly goofy routine featuring Pryor doing a Little Richard routine is interrupted as though another channel is accidentally bleeding through and we are treated to a dramatic monologue about a lonely woman's (imaginary?) lesbian encounter that looks like it's from a cable access show. A brilliant, touching piece of writing and performing that hints at what potential the show could have had if Pryor had been allowed the time and freedom to create what he wanted.
--A couple of skits later Pryor shifts gears entirely and presents a lovely and heartfelt circus performance for a group of children. Seems like a precursor to his ""Pryor's Place"" children's show he created over a decade later.
--The show ends with a very funny group improv performance by the entire cast. Like the standup routine from earlier on, it seems out of place among the goofy sketch comedy we've become used to from the show--but it is fresh and at least ten times as funny.

Fourth Episode: Pure gold all the way through.
--A sketch reminiscent of Pryor's classic ""Wino and Dracula"" standup routine with Pryor as a toned down version of his old Wino character and a cast member as a Mr. Hyde monster. Funny enough and Pryor-ish that it should have been longer.
--The Richard Pryor Roast. An 12 minute edit of a totally out of control 45 minute roasting of the boss by the cast and writers of the show (the unedited version is included on the dvd as an extra). The stuff that made it onto the show was still pretty funny. Paul Mooney, a pre-Mork Robin Williams, Marsha Warfield, Tim ""Venus Flytrap"" Reid and Sandra Bernhard participate.
--A Titanic sketch with Pryor as a porter pulling drowning white folks into a lifeboat is very funny and reminiscent of the word association skit he did with Chevy Chase back on SNL.
--The Gun Shop is a chilling non-comic sketch that most effectively translates the Pryor type storytelling to the sketch form as he wanders through a gun shop and the various weapons talk to him. Reminded me of the routine where his heart talks to him during a heart attack. Except more serious.
--The show ends on a comic note with Pryor as a horny Santa Claus. A big black ""Censored"" bar blacks out half the sketch.
--the dvd includes a very powerful sketch on TV violence that was rejected by the censors. It features Pryor becoming enraged about a philandering wife and tearing a room to pieces. Funny, touching, out of control and a little bit scary. At one point he yells ""MY FIRST GOOD WEEK!"" and he must have been talking about his show. This was the only skit that featured the kind of rage Pryor showed in his standup routines. Powerful and compelling.
--The show ends with Pryor thanking the cast and crew of the show, a touching ending for a series that I think started out as a bitter joke and ended up as a labor of love.

It's too bad Pryor didn't continue the series or at least do some more specials because I think based on the improvement from the early episodes to the last one, Pryor and company could have made television history.

ps--Also too bad he wasn't working during the cable TV era. The outtakes on the DVDs are profane and hilarious. Pryor cut totally loose on TV would put guys like Chapelle to shame.",1224806400,8,7388,4.592115238817286
1986292,5,B0001BKAP8,"This is Richard Pryor. Serious comedy. For all of you who feel this is not up to standards you're used to. You must be too young or you forgot what the 70's were like. This is real 'push the envelope' comedy. Sometimes you laugh and you realize, there is a real sad message behind what you've just witness. And sometimes it's just downright bellyaching funny. The problem was, television was not ready for Richard Pryor. The few places television allowed him to take us, he had to fight, scratch and kick just to get his point made. Does Dave Chappelle come to mind? You can't look at this as just a comedy show. You've got to look at it as a documentary. Be glad we've got this little taste of Richard.",1213660800,2,703,4.374045801526718
1986293,5,B0001BKAP8,"Thought that Richard was ahead of his time when he did this show on TV.  It was funny then and it is still funny.

Was surprise to see a few comdedians that are well known today that were on the show; Robin Williams, Tim Reid, Witherspoon, Marsha Whitfield...",1138752000,4,259,4.375
1986294,5,B0001BKAP8,"Yes, that's right,if Andy Kaufman were a black American, he'd be Richard Pryor. Just like Andy, this DVD set made me happy,sad,angry,confused, and even scared from bewilderment! I laughed at ""Star Wars Bar,"" as well as, his ""White Head in a Cage"" skit. I cried when I saw the sincere heartwarming love shown in pieces like ""Satin Doll"" and even more so in the endearing ""the Day the Circus Came to the Ghetto"" skit. I got angry at his various skits where he uses racial slurs, like the ""n"" word,etc. But oddly, I almost got a panic attack from watching probably the wierdest thing I've ever seen on a video which was a skit (if you can call it that) where Richard pretends he's Little Richard singing on a piano, then suddenly, we see a sort of pirated signal of an insanely weird monologue(?) of a self-confessed lesbian apparently talking to herself in a living room, yet telling a string of fibs about being first a victim of sexual stalking, but then finally admitting that she was the actual stalker herself(?????).WHOAH!! Jesus Christ, that weirded me out! Can somebody explain that one to me? Send me an e-mail please! And I see ALOT of weird 70's movies and shows, let me tell you! Well, regardless, I recommend this if you want to know what psychotronic t.v. is like! Get these DVD's!",1113609600,3,1293,4.6017316017316015
1986295,4,B0001BKAP8,"Good stuff, but not as good as the SNL appearance mentioned in another review.
One mystery: There is a photo on one of the DVD cases (also appears in the Pryor CD box set book) of Pryor and John Belushi doing a sketch where they are onstage with guitar, harmonica and upright bass.  This sketch is not on the DVDs...where is it?",1085788800,5,328,4.290322580645161
1986296,3,B0001BKAP8,"I agree with most of the other reviews here that point at that The Richard Pryor Show -- like the man's movies -- pale in comparison to the absolutely brilliant stand-up work that he did.  While there are some pretty funny moments on these DVDs, the best are in the extras, some of which show Richard either unscripted or performing parts of his act.
These four (five) episodes could be edited down to an excellent 60-minute ""Best of The Richard Pryor Show"" feature, because most of the skits are hit-or-miss.  The good sketches make this DVD set deserve some rewatching, but I guarantee that I will use the chapter skip button to avoid some of the less entertaining material.
Unfortunately, I felt that the packaging of this set was designed to be sold at a higher price, due to the fact that it comes in three separate DVD cases instead of the foldout designs used for most TV show collections.  I am also doubting it was necessary to put this collection on three discs instead of two.  3+ hour-long movies with a full 5.0 soundtrack can be held on one disc, so it seems like 5 48-or-so minute-long episodes, plus a handful of extras, should be able to fit on two discs.
If you're a huge Richard Pryor fan like I am, I would encourage you to purchase this collection.  I was thrilled to be able to see video footage of Pryor's brilliant ""Mudbone - Little Feets"" bit.  If you can get around the seemingly inflated price (which at $30 isn't awful), you'll find some amusement in this collection.",1084492800,28,1495,4.5390334572490705
1986297,3,B0001BKAP8,Richard Pryor is My All time Favorite Comedian Period.but Him&TV just did not fully blend.there are some cool Moments here&the Bonus Material saves the day. Marsha Warfield is cool as is Tim Reid&Sandra bernhard. Robin williams&Richard Pryor have alot of chemistry. John Witherspoon&Paul Mooney do there thing. Paula Kelly as Satan Doll was cool as well. TV ain't changed much&you can see Richard having to water certain things down.but there are some cool Performances nevertheless.,1082678400,6,483,5.453333333333333
1986298,3,B0001BKAP8,"This is a tough one.  Say Richard Pryor's name and ""70s network television,"" and you'll have a reason why this series lasted only four episodes.  But censorship wasn't the only problem this show had.
Pryor repeatedly tried to parlay his phenomenally successful stand-up career into mainstream success, but his efforts usually resulted in crappy movies that did his talents no justice (anyone want to remember ""The Toy?"").  This show -- which Pryor said he personally cancelled -- is better than those, with some funny skits, like The Pips performing ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" and ""Midnight Train to Georgia"" without Gladys Knight, or Pryor and a youthful Marsha Warfield doing an achingly funny pantomine in a restaurant.
Many skits, however, are overly long and hinge on the audience finding humor in things like a black samurai.  Other skits are heavy-handed dramatic pieces so jarring it feels like the show is slapping you for laughing at previous skits.  ""What, you think that's funny?  Public intoxication is not funny!  Here, Maya Angelou will show you!""
Pryor assembled a talented ensemble -- Robin Williams is prominent, and Tim Reid and Sandra Bernhard also show up -- but Pryor is the center of show, and the other actors generally act as his straight men.  Film of the actors improvising screams for Pryor and Williams to play off each other: The footage, unfortunately, doesn't show that pairing.  All the characters are Pryor's, and the supporting troupe never really got a chance to spread their wings.
It wouldn't be fair to call this a failed program: ""The Richard Pryor"" was strangled in the cradle before it had a chance to develop a natural flow.  As it stands, it's an interesting curiosity, which, given time, might have become something memorable.",1082332800,35,1779,5.020408163265306
