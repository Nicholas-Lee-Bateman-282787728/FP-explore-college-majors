4047116,4,B0030Y12A0,"My son has Down's Syndrome and he migrates from one subject to another in videos but only after COMPLETELY saturating his mind with ALL content of the video. This is why I appreciate videos like 7th Heaven that is a clean show. He is now on his 2nd season of 7th Heaven (and I'm sure will continue to others until he has them all). Prior to these, it was wrestling - P U L E E S E!!!!

It's such a change to switch to 7th Heaven.

Thank you for fine videos like these.",1271894400,11,468,3.9680851063829787

4047190,5,B0030Y12A0,"I just finished watching my DVDs of Season 10. It was so good (and addictive), that I finished it within 2 weeks. I was really impressed with the handling of the story about Martin and Sandy, and also Ruthie's reaction. Admittedly, I didn't really like Ruthie Camden's character in the earlier seasons, but she came to be one of the more interesting Camden kids. I especially enjoyed her character in Season 10, in the episodes related to her and Martin. I just really liked how this season developed the various personal dramas, and has continued to stick to its philosophy about the virtues and serious commitment of marriage and having a family. I only have one season left to watch, but I have to say - I have really loved this show.",1473638400,5,737,4.590909090909091

4047243,5,B0030Y12A0,"I have watched the episodes from the beginning. Its really something how i could watch this family grow up and see how each child handled their teenage and adult years!  Ruthie started out as a preschooler and is in high school! Thats a lot of years to view over a short time. Simon was a cute young character and changed so much as he (slowly) matured.
All the children changed a bit growing older.....all different types. My most unfavorite characters were Annie, the mother; and Lucy, one of the daughters!
I loved Kevin's character!!!",1465948800,2,538,4.723404255319149

4047269,5,B0030Y12A0,I love the show because you guys are really good characters. I love how you guys find out what your kids problems are. And if something is wrong because your kid went out or something then you have a feeling that something's wrong. And holy cow Ruthy she's awesome she knows everything. I love Lucy she's a great character I love her personality I love she made it threw school and I really love that she married Kevin you guys match and wow you guys had a baby that's cool threw out the whole movie I was wondering if Lucy was ever gonna get married that's awesome she did. I love the twins.,1461283200,4,592,4.247787610619469
4047270,1,B0030Y12A0,"I don't know why I continue to watch this series. The acting is just abysmal. Kevin delivers lines as poorly as those talentless twin boys. Ruthie was a better actress at 5 than she is now at 15. Annie is the ultimate hypocrite. She is judgmental, rude, and obnoxious. They continue to demonize the only decent actor to ever grace this series, Jessica Biel, by making her character abandon her husband and child. They turned Simon into a completely pathetic loser that decides to marry a woman identical to his mother: controlling, rude, and obnoxious. Don't even get me started on Stephen Collins.... When this show aired originally, I had LONG given up before season 10. Now I'm watching it a decade later to see exactly why. At least now I can skip over the really boring, preachy, liberal agenda portions.",1461110400,2,809,4.74468085106383
4047271,4,B0030Y12A0,"There of course is a lot of drama with 7th Heaven..........but a lot of time there is points to ponder.  Some earlier seasons tried too hard to be a comedy.  As I said before, if you can get past Collins history, I think most people would enjoy this series.  I will say, I doubt most parents could put up in real life what this family goes through.  It overall has a religious feel.",1461110400,2,382,4.191780821917808

4047337,5,B0030Y12A0,My husband and I both enjoy watching 7th Heaven.  I stumbled upon a newer episode on the Woman's station on a Sunday afternoon and decided to start at the beginning.  With my Amazon Prime membership we have free access through ROKU.  We have been enjoying the entire series ever since.  We have watched as many as 4 episodes in one day.  Most episodes have good messages.  Occasionally there is a message that is the complete opposite from our views but all in all the messages are good.  Lots of laughs and some tears too.  We are now in season 20.  One more season left for us to watch.,1448323200,3,588,4.37037037037037

I always thought though that Mary had such a good upbringing and a good responsible personality in the early years that given her good family foundation, she would not have turned out to be as irresponsible as the script portrays her. It just doesn't follow. I realize that she wanted to leave the show and to make up for her absence, showing her to be so irresponsible and having a 180 degree turn on the value of family was one option. It just doesn't make logical sense. I really liked her character and I don't think this scenario does her character justice. It would have been much better to have her die in an accident or from some illness.",1399248000,,773,4.4125874125874125

4047566,5,B0030Y12A0,"I really love the way the 10th season was packaged. The only downside for me, is when you watch the season finale, the ending song, where it shows clips from previous seasons, is not 'You Got It"" by Roy Orbison, which if you can find the particular season and scene on youtube, you'd hear it in that ending. I also wish they'd put special features in their dvds too. :)",1319846400,,369,4.285714285714286
4047567,5,B0030Y12A0,"We almost missed this blessing when we heard from a friend that is was too ""worldly"" and the kids had too many problems. I am so glad that we decided to see for ourselves. As Christian parents of a 12 year old girl, we are very particular about what we let her watch and what and how she is exposed to certain issues. Yes, the Camden kids have ""issues"", but what we think is more important is the way in which they solve problems and approach these issues. No one has the ""perfect"" parenting solutions (well, except our Heavenly Father), but truth, family, honesty and unconditional love seem a good place to start! We think it is important to teach our 12 year old about what is out there. We want her to hear it and talk about it with US first! Thank you to the writers and producers of 7th Heaven for putting ""it"" out there in a way that was not offensive. We still have Season 10 and the Final to go - but we are ""hooked""! (And so are my 78 year old parents!)
By the way - we would probably be labeled ""strict"" by many - even by  Christian standards!

That it centers on a newborn boy whom a very few months later they celebrate the torture maiming and murder inflicted on him by the equivalent felony religionists of Jesus Nazarenas' environment compounds the offensiveness of that population littering promotion.  The episode ignores the reality of the nonreligious humane Sinter Klaas who did such things as providing a lump of coal to impoverished children in his geography so that they might have a bit of warmth in the bleak cold Winters of northern Europe and perhaps even a rare hot meal (later subverted by felony religionists into a pretense that a lump of coal represented an insult to bad little boys and girls and diverted by Eric into a relocation to the felony religionist ""Saint Nicholas"" as if that were the origins of Santa Claus).  It ignores the reality of the Feast of Lights celebrated for thousands of years prior to the Wholly Roman Umpire's perversities.  Perhaps even worse it ignores the Xian perversity of demanding that *others* donate to the enrichment of the felony tax evading ""religion"" gangs and to claim credit for the gangs rather than the donors by proselityzing recipients of *others* generosity into the human and civil rights abrogations of organized ""religion"".

I am now 20 and I have finished the entire series. My only complaint about season 10 is that Simon doesn't end up with Rose. For some reason between season 10-11 the screen writers seem to enjoy trashing Martin Brewer, and Simon Camden. I am not sure why but for some reason  both characters end up with the crap end of the bargain. Other than that season 10 probably is the most entertaining season of above all the others.
