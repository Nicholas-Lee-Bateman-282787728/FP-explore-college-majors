8456997,5,B0054S352I,"McMurray and Colbert were very good together in this film. A good plot, and fine acting by both. I like old black and white's and don't care much for a lot of the crap they do today. It's a down home movie and has a nice ending. I know the younger crowd will call this old fogie but compared to some of the stuff they do today this movie is just fine with me.",1481068800,2,359,3.864864864864865

If you collect classic films,collect this one .I doubt you'll be sorry. A#1*****",1439856000,3,246,4.488888888888889
8457001,5,B0054S352I,"This is a classic romantic comedy  that is presented with a light touch - a triangle of the attractive working  girl who by plot machinations attracts the attentions of a wealthy British  lord {Ray Milland} and  a ""down to earth"" common man reporter {Fred MacMurry}.  Fred and Ray are at the early stages  of their careers and both  do a nice job  in support of Ms. Colbert who plays her role with a sly , knowing sensuality and her breezy perfomance  dominates the film. Ray is handsome and in raptures over  Claudette and Fred a  popcorn enthusiast  is a gruff red blooded American male who will get his women despite his rivals wealth and society  connections. This is the first of 8 films that Claudette  and Fred would co-star in over the next 14 years and {as usual} they play off each other very well - sophisticated Claudette versus rough  hewn Fred. This is a really nice film that is  entertaining with  good production values and I recommend it with a 5 star rating.",1430092800,2,977,4.522988505747127
8457002,5,B0054S352I,A beautifully clear film. Claudette Colbert and Fred McMurray+ Ray Milland do a great job of entertaining the audience. In this case me. I highly recommend this movie. My only complaint is I wish Lynn (Claudette) had chosen between her men differently.,1411344000,2,252,5.023809523809524
8457003,3,B0054S352I,"Claudette Colbert is wonderful in this film, forced to choose between young Fred MacMurray and young Ray Milland (both of whom went on to star with Colbert in a few more films). Especially funny is how Colbert's character Lynn meets cute with Milland's character in a subway station.",1356220800,2,283,4.916666666666667
8457004,5,B0054S352I,"I first saw this movie years ago on AMC Classics.  It was shown then all the time.  Then AMC changed and no longer showed this movie.  When I tried to purchase it, I discovered that it had not yet been put on VHS or DVD.  After years of waiting, I am finally the happy owner of The Gilded Lily.  Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray acted so well together.  They were comfortable with one another and their acting seemed effortless.  I really liked the movie when I first saw it in 80s (90s?, on AMC Classics) and I still like it now.",1318032000,10,534,4.227722772277228
