8191190,5,B000PGDHHC,"These are great!! A little dated of course, but who cares! Being a fan of shows like Forensic Files, American Justice and The First 48, it's interesting to see the things about police work that really haven't changed that much. These are some of the first shows to have been produced so they're not really as 'campy' as the ones I remember from the 60s and 70s.  And the subject matter is quite realistic, especially for the 1950s.",1204416000,3,431,4.5256410256410255
