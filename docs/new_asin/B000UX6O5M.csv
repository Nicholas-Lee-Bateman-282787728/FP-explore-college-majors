8215396,4,B000UX6O5M,"My first question would be... if this is so ""unauthorized"" and P has went thru the entire net removing such material, then why is this still here? He has that power we know. As for the presented material, it was not great picture quality but awesome that it does exist no matter. There was some footage I had not seen and/or not seen in full. Having VHS tapes of stuff back to the leggings days, I loved having this DVD for this day and age of multimedia formats. Here you can see the life changes our Prince has taken on and hopefully respect it in the same terms as you respect his artistry and control of it.

I became a true supporter of his work not just based in his artistic creativity but the truth behind his thoughts about being a ""fan"". He was the first one who led me to stop using the word and find ""supporter"" instead. In an interview not on here, he told us to worship GOD but ""support"" his music by all means. This was in the afro days and I've been a life long ""supportee"" since.

Personally, I am glad to own the DVD and saved pennies for a very long time while beating myself up whether or not to purchase this work. Oprah, Tavis, Bryant Gumbel and a few more interviews are just some of the names you'll view while enjoying P's love of his music and the lengths he's taken to keep it HIS. Even if you've seen the interviews before, I feel it is a collector's item on DVD. A) these are ooooold interviews and b) you never know when P will look over here and remove this too. Get it now while you still can. I'm glad I did and am not sorry if he doesn't make any monetary gains from it. It's a knowledge base that maybe P should have capitalized on himself if that is the case.",1227312000,2,1695,4.148936170212766
8215397,3,B000UX6O5M,The video was long but I enjoyed it because there were some interviews in there that I had heard about but had never seen.  I enjoyed it.,1200873600,3,137,4.074074074074074
8215398,5,B000UX6O5M,"please come out with another video like this! I love it, number 1 reason being I didn't have to spend the time putting it together. yes yes it is not officially released but I'm such a huge fan/fam that anything with Prince on it, about it I will buy.. I'm sorry Prince.. He wouldn't agree but I'm a fam and I love to see interviews and performances etc. and I am so so so so happy.... I now have the Oprah interview that was taken here in Minneapolis at Prince's own paisley park.  Some day I hope to have on DVD the show Muppet's tonight with Prince, oh wow that would be great!...
If your a huge fan you can to some degree appreciate this film...

Peace & B Wild!

8215399,1,B000UX6O5M,"If you are a fan, you have probably seen alot of these ""interviews"" on this dvd before. The fact that all the musical performances have been eliminated from it makes it even more of a waste of time.  It is horribly edited and NOT worth the time or money!!",1199059200,3,255,4.204081632653061
8215400,5,B000UX6O5M,"I think the above review is a tad unfair. Just because one individual has seen all of the DVDs content on sites such as YouTube, etc (before it got taken down!) doesn't make a DVD rubbish. I too had seen most of the content before but found it nice to have it all on one disc that I can watch whenever I like without worrying about Prince trying to shut me down! And it's pretty damn cheap too... I don't think anyone can really feel ripped off getting a quality load of Prince interviews for $18.

I thought the best interview was the Oprah one... was good to see P's pad!",1196121600,14,573,4.162162162162162
8215401,1,B000UX6O5M,"PEOPLE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!!!
Any Prince fan would be very dissapointed, in getting this rip off DVD, of some interviews he has done over the years. All of them have been seen, and I was led to believe their were some unseen interviews. The DVD states on the cover ""Not Authorized by the artists, or anyone on film...""
I could not see this until the DVD arrived. Someone is out to make a quick buck, and I got suckered !

The ONLY redeeming quality of this DVD is the fact that you see Prince act a little silly (Refreshing, to me at least...) With Jay Leno, and Bryant Gumble. But, if you have seen these nterviews, do yourself a favor, DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!",1195862400,10,670,4.234375
