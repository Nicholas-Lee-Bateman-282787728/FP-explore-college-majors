The series was produced by WETA, and was available only to the education market.  As far as I know, it was never offered to the public, nor has it been available on DVD, anytime, anywhere.

It's a shame, since this is riveting television.  The 1960s were a decade that had drama galore; two Kennedys assassinated, MLK killed, race riots, Watts, the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and much more.

Very Highly Recommended.  I loved this series.  I just wish I could find it on DVD.  If you are lucky, you'll find an occasional copy at auction, usually from a library somewhere.

Update:  I found the video!  There are DVDs available, overseas, in a PAL format (which shouldn't be a real problem these days, since multi-region DVD players are readily available now).  Get this series!  If you lived through the 60s, or any part of it, or you are interested in learning about the era, this is the documentary series for you!  This is a winner!",1271980800,,1151,4.656716417910448

In the 60's there were two youth rebellians and this volume examines the political end of that. It all started in 1963 when there was a coup in Cambodia,South Vietnam. Fears of communist expansion led to deployment of US troops in that country. In the meantime LBJ had just been elected as president and was determined to rid America of poverty with his Great Society. While much of these programs did work,there was a government obligation to continue a war in Vietnam to stave of the perceived communist threat. So young collage students and black civil rights activists,already angered by the events of racism and whose lives and livelihoods were effect by the Great Society began protesting the Vietnam War. Even civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. took an adament stance against the war. After his and Robert Kennedy's assasination in 1968 the anti war movement became more violent and confrontational,culminating in a riot between activists and
polititions at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Another reason for this is that there was a draft for Vietnam and many young people,including conscienous objecters ended up going to war against their will. Adding this political discord to the counterculture and an ever more aggresive civil rights struggle 1968 ended up being the one year in the 20'th century where America came very close to having it's own internal civil war and this documents this with great detail.",1235088000,,1536,5.027450980392157
