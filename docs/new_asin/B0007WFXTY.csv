8052633,3,B0007WFXTY,"This was a pretty good documentary about 6 different journalists who were killed in the line of duty. Considering there were at least 40 others, I wish it was longer and gave a better overview, rather than just 6 specific stories. Only worth watching if bought on sale or if you have an interest on the subject.",1327276800,,311,4.473684210526316
