8644865,3,B00IS5CZS4,"I found Echo Bridge's 15 HORROR MOVIE COLLECTION at Dollar General.
Paid a buck for it!
In their storage case, three 5-movie DVDs are stacked one on the other.
Minimal movie data is provided-- ratings and ""name"" actors (in a few cases).
Stereo sound, full and widescreen dubs of fine quality, no annoying on-screen IDs.

The first picture that caught my attention was HOW TO BE A SERIAL KILLER (2008).
Its star, Dameon Clarke plays his sociopathic murderer in a light vein. At times he
reminds you of John Cusack. The film has a novel concept. It's presented as an
upbeat infomercial with Daemon as lecturer to an adoring crowd who lays out
his special way to make your sad life totally fulfilling: start killing total strangers!

Clarke takes a lonely video store clerk under his wing and shows him step by step
the fine art of serial killing. This one's better than its current 5.6 IMDb rating.
.

BUNNYMAN (2011) is way too sick for any normal person's sensibilities.
Six kids run afoul of some country road hog in a small diesel truck and
eventually they are slowly murdered in a most gruesome fashion as each is
caught by some deviant family of cannibals. Wish I hadn't seen it. (2.9 rating)
.

THE KILLING JAR (1997) is a horror story heavy with psychological drama
elements. Its central character is a small town vineyard and winery owner
who slowly seems to go mad from violent memories locked in his subconscious.
That's the outward premise, but the reality is out-of-left-field bait-and-switch.

What gives this 4.5 IMDber any watchability is its supporting cast of familiar faces:
Tom Bower (he was the Patti Page-loving janitor in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DIE-HARD-II/dp/B001KH5AHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DIE HARD II)</a>, Wes Studi (playing
yet another noble Native American), M. Emmet Walsh (perfect as the sheriff-- you
know his face) and Frank McRae (African American ex-footballer who was Arnold
Schwartzenegger's police lieutenant boss in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LAST-ACTION-HERO/dp/B00HZMZ2FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LAST ACTION HERO</a>-- remember the
smoke that came from his ears as he yelled double talk at Arnold?). Finally there's
Brion James. So perfect as a psycho villain in any number of action pictures, here
he's a kindly shrink who practices hypnotism on the film's star, Brett Cullen.

.
THE MESMERIST (2002) is inspired by a Poe short story, ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.""
It's a dark story of feigned whimsy about an elderly man (Howard Hesseman) who's
about to breathe his last. He allows a kook (""fruitcake"") hypnotist (Jason Carter) to put him
under so he can communicate with the living from the great beyond.
