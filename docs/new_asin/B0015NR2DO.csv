8259197,4,B0015NR2DO,Would recommand it to Winston Churchill fans as a unique historial document. Less interesting then previous biography. Less fascinating and a little long.,1390867200,2,154,5.739130434782608
8259198,3,B0015NR2DO,"I purchased this DVD solely for the purpose of having the famous ""never surrender"" speech for posterity.  What a colossal disappointment; it's NOT included.  And to add insult to injury, TWO titles are misspelled on this DVD: ""Rosevelt"" (you must be kidding me) and ""Those Who Sowed the Wind"" is on film as ""Those Who SEWED the Wind"".  How does one, exactly, SEW the wind?  Would love to know what size needle you'd need for that job.

This is a disappointing, amateurish production in this reviewer's opinion.  I feel that I got duped, to be honest.",1303689600,16,550,4.677083333333333
8259199,5,B0015NR2DO,"If you admire Winston Churchill then you'll certainly like this DVD.  It is well put together with film footage,  which would have been a very new medium back in his day, of various speeches and events.  It is fascinating to watch his mannerisms during and after giving a speech. You gain such insight from watching him rather that only hearing or reading the speeches.",1299024000,4,369,4.734375
8259200,5,B0015NR2DO,"Lots of good info about this great man who brout Brita throu WW II like Chaimberlin never could have, or any other brit could.",1231286400,7,126,4.291666666666667
