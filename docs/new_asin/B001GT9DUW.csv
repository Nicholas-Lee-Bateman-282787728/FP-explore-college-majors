3619641,3,B001GT9DUW,"While the production is good overall, the story is something similar to Star Wars if the writers had spent ten hours coming up with ways to keep Luke and Vader from having the final showdown. Somehow, this just never grabbed my imagination or interest.",1372896000,,252,4.75

3619644,4,B001GT9DUW,"Glass Fleet is the story Michel and Cleo trying to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the empire. It's kinda like star wars. If Darth Vader were gay and had braids there wouldn't be much difference. There a lot of interesting characters in this anime. There is a good mix of action and drama. The most impressive aspects of this anime are the animation quality and the space battles. It's a unique anime series and there aren't too many other series that are all that similar. I really enjoyed watching this anime. As I said the characters are the best part of Glass Fleet. The bad guy is so bad that you'll wanna fight him yourself, and the heroes will make you wanna strap up and go to bat with them. Overall Glass Fleet is a solid anime. I'd say that my only complaint is the sick little pervert that always follows Vetti, the bad guy, around everywhere. He's pretty sickening. Glass Fleet will probably be a good addition to your collection. It's not a bad price either.",1350172800,,975,4.4525139664804465
3619645,4,B001GT9DUW,"Glass fleet is good, light entertainment.  It's a good yarn.  The characters have some depth.  There is a twist in the familiar Japanese ""the son follows in the footsteps of the father"" theme.  The DVD is reasonably priced.",1338681600,,223,4.7894736842105265
3619646,2,B001GT9DUW,"Viewer discretion is highly advised for this anime series.

Also, I will be revealing two ""spoilers"" in the course of this review; one of these, however, is blatantly obvious from the first minute or so of the series, and the second will encapsulate some of my other observations of the series.

First off, Glass Fleet is a space opera that depicts the ""galaxy in revolution"" against the Holy Emperor, Vetti.  Opposing Vetti's tyranny is the People's Army, headed by the enigmatic revolutionary Michelle.  Eventually Michelle will seek to enlist the aid of Cleo, captain of a mysteriously powerful glass battleship, and his crew.  Throughout the series, the bitter rivalry between Cleo and Vetti becomes increasingly important.

As a programmer, writer, and artist, I watch a fair amount of media in order to glean ideas for my various projects.  I will say that Glass Fleet did not disappoint in this regard; the visuals are stunning in places, as the galaxy is populated with vast ""Territorial Vessels"" or floating landmasses, numerous vessels and fleets of varied and spectacular design, and a black hole in the shape of a cross that is worshiped by a religious sect even as it pulls the entire galaxy towards imminent destruction.  Whatever else one may say about Glass Fleet, it is an entertaining view.

However, there was a lot that I did not like about this series.  The three main characters (Vetti, Cleo, and Michelle) are all completely self-absorbed, though they may try to justify this to themselves.  It becomes readily apparent in the first episode that Michelle is in fact a woman, and when we later learn the reason for this deception, it boils down to little else besides a ""big brother complex."" (That was spoiler number one, there.)  Cleo's only goal in life is to conquer the galaxy, though for what purpose we never really find out.  At numerous points in the series, he tells other characters that he really doesn't care whether they follow him or not, and intones that his ""wind of destiny"" is carrying him to a final outcome.  In reality, he is an arrogant, stubborn fool who would be totally lost without the skills of his crew to support him.  And Vetti, a really nasty piece of work, seems to care for no one, casting aside or eliminating anything that stands between himself and his goal of immortality.

Other characters are imbalanced and eccentric to the point of annoyance as well.  Noe, the encryption genius, is a whiny little boy who becomes completely useless when he loses his glasses, which is often and annoying.  The weapons specialist whose name I forget at the moment has the ferocity and testosterone-pumped aggression of a grizzly bear, and the mental capacity of a five-year-old.  Towards the middle of the series, one character is thrown into a prison cell with a dozen perverted ""lifers"" who initially try to do some nasty stuff to her, but then somehow become her best buddies later on in the series.

This is also a series without moral compass or honor, as the final outcome demonstrates all too admirably.  (Here comes the second spoiler.)  Vetti seduces his foster mother, coerces her into killing her husband, and then Vetti himself murders her.  Throughout the series, Vetti has an intimate (sexuality is implied) relationship with Ralph, Vetti's consort and bodyguard, who is a young boy.  Vetti is flagrantly promiscuous and manipulative, obsessing over and then casting aside his ""love"" interests, including at one point Michelle.  After his numerous atrocities, murders, and sins, (including the killing of Cleo) Vetti becomes the one to unite and rule the galaxy.  To top it all off, the very people that Vetti manipulated and abused seem to unanimously come to support him, including Michelle and the People's Army, despite the numerous losses of their loved ones and comrades at his hands.  What a great ending (sarcasm, that).

If you like happy endings, this series is not for you.  If you believe that evil should be punished and good should triumph, this series is not for you.  If you're looking for some ideas for a creative enterprise and don't really expect too much else of value, this might be for you.  I can't say I'm glad I watched it (about halfway through I just wanted it to end, and had to alternate episodes with another anime to maintain my sanity), but there are some interesting designs in this series, so I'll keep it as a reference.",1334448000,,4417,4.864973262032086

3619650,2,B001GT9DUW,"This was the first anime I have ever bought.  My girlfriend has let me borrow countless, so I figured, ""Hey, I'll buy one.""  I began watching trailers on youtube to see which I should purchase, and this trailer looked absolutely amazing!  DON'T buy into the trailer.  IT'S A TRAP!  This is kind of like the French Revolution, but in space, where people can breath in this vast vacuum of darkness.  Also, not to nag on everything, but the main villains sidekick was a girl?  No, a little homosexually needy boy named....wait for it...Ralph.  However, this is sometimes really fun to watch due to its shear stupidity.  There was a point where the main villain and hero clashed in a epic battle in the snow....what happened?  There shirts exploded off their body.  Honestly, it's a goofy anime and it's not all that bad, but seriously, don't buy it.  Rent it, or borrow it from a friend.  Buy something else instead.",1306108800,,913,4.666666666666667
3619651,4,B001GT9DUW,"I was introduced to this series through my anime club in collage. We watched first episode and the entire thing had everyone in stitches. It was one of those episodes that is really funny without intending to be so. I watched it a second time with a different group of friends and found that it wasn't nearly as funny, but this time I was actually interested in the story and what came next.

The story isn't anything really new - the brave Michael Volban leads the People's Army against the tyrant and self-proclaimed Holy Emperor, Vetti Sforza, and then Cleo Corbeille, the last of the royal family, shows up unexpectedly to join the rebellion. But this all takes place in- outer space.

The setting was undoubtedly my favorite part of this series. The beautifully colored, star strewn backgrounds to elegant spaceships, while characters fought duels in the void of space. Without oxygen. Apparently their version of space is very different from ours. At times it felt more like a navel story with a cooler background.

Thing that surprised me about this series is the ending. I thought it was unexpected and well done. It played a big part in my appreciation of this series. A bad ending can ruin a great series and inversely a solid ending can make an ok show good. While I enjoyed Glass Fleet, it was the ending that really made this series for me.

However, a warning. There is one episode that I strongly recommend skipping. After watching episode 11 I almost stopped watching the series all together. It was the background story for the evil Emperor character and it was seriously twisted. I had never seen this sort of thing in anime before and certainly hadn't expected it in this sort of series. It is good for the story in a way, but I felt tainted after watching it and if I ever go back and watch the series again, I will be skipping that episode as fast as I can.

But other than that, I recommend this series for good renaissance space fun.",1295481600,,1956,4.577142857142857
3619652,3,B001GT9DUW,"Glass Fleet is interesting but becomes a bit muddled at firstas to who the peoples Army is why its led by royalty and who or what is main protaganist. Why is it called the Glass Fleet when there is only one ship made of the special ""Glass"". Also confusing whether the space ships are spaceships, buildings or even chunks of land.
However, it is exciting and intriguing but the ending is a little silly.",1274486400,,402,4.445945945945946
3619653,5,B001GT9DUW,"After watching Glass Fleet about two times, I still cry at the end. It had such a touching story and a lot
of inspirational words. The best way I can describe it is, a different version of Star Wars plus a few others things placed into the story.

  The story takes place in a far off galaxy that is under the religion of the Black Cross, which is a large
cross in the sky that is actually a black hole. The main character Michel Volban is the leader of a rebellious army called, the People's Army. Michel holds a harsh past on his/her [don't want to give out spoilers!] shoulders while he/she fights against the emperor Vetti Sforza and the empire. When all seemed lost to Michel and the people's army, a strong wind comes out from the corner of the galaxy. A space pirate named Cleo Corbeille had seemed to be a savior for the people's army in the eyes of Michel. But it seemed Cleo did not want to have any part of it..

  Many people have never heard of the anime since it had gotten many bad reviews from many people. Possibly it's because I'm interested in the universe myself, who knows. The voice acting in this anime was very well done and many people who are fans of the well known ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" will recognize some of the voices. I give this a five star rating since it is and always will be one of my favorites.",1262304000,,1331,4.282868525896414
3619654,4,B001GT9DUW,"This is hard to explain but...A Medieval Tale in Space. First of all the ""Laws of Physics"" do not apply. Islands of rock drifting in space, horse drawn carriages yet they do a lot of fighting in Space ships. You will see numerous Space battles--sword fights all of which are well done. There is no fan service to speak of.
 As for myself this was a 3 1/2 star series. To start with it is in a Widescreen format and comes in a thin pak with 2 DVD cases, one on each side of the DVD case.
 The story line is about an Emperor who seeks nothing but power. He treats his subjects poorly and rules with an iron fist. Thus setting himself up for a rebellion lead by Micheal though I think it is pronounced Michelle. Micheal is quickly defeated and is drifting when their space ship is rammed and being looted by pirates...enter Cleo. Now the true journey begins...to right what is wrong. To fulfill the long awaited prophecy. ""When what was two becomes one"".
 I will not tell you the whole story but this is not a stand alone series it is continuous. While there are a couple of flash backs there is nothing that takes away from this series. Most voices are nicely done and the quality of animation is good from start to finish. While it does have CG it does not rely on it heavily and it blends excellently together. The storyline moves forward at a steady pace and introduces new characters which keeps you interested.
  This was a show I was glad I bought and it has good replay value but 50 bucks is a little spendy. If you can get it around 30-35 bucks it is a solid buy.
  Now will you like it.....I do not know but I can tell you the type of series that I enjoy...which are things like..Trinity Blood..Black Blood Brothers..Hellsing..Jyu Oh Sei..Death Note though this is not as intense as those it is still worth watching.",1249516800,,1823,4.359882005899705

8306946,5,B001GT9DUW,"A series of space, conquering and with a side of a love, here is my review for Glass Fleet! Please enjoy

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) Our story begins with a battle between two space fleets, one being the ruling aristocratic family  and the other being the army of Vetti Sforza. After the quick battle Vetti proclaims him self holy emperor and wants to unite the galaxy under his rule so everyone can have peace. Time skip to a few months later where a wedding is taking place and it is interrupted by the people's army under the ruling of Michel Volban (pronounced Michelle) who is trying to take down Vetti's empire and free everyone from the oppression he brought to the galaxy. When the battle of Michel and the people's forces are hit back by Vetti's army Michel and her two servants who are Jean the 90 year old butler and his granddaughter Sylua, are chased off in a space ship where they only want to capture Michel for a great reward. When suddenly a space ship what looks like its made from glass comes by and saves the day. When Michel goes to thank the captain of the ship Michel finds out that it is lead by Cleo and his pirate mercenaries who only want money and booze from them. When Cleo is nagged by Michel to be a prisoner instead of being left in space Cleo accepts Michel, Jean and Sylua and takes them to planet called Orleans and he will drop them off until the people's army can rescue Michel. When Cleo and Michel go to a prophet, Cleo is given a prophecy and it says  ""When The End comes, a Two Headed Eagle will be born. One of The Heads will be clad in Metal Armor and The Other will become The God of Love. Then it will become as One to Restore the Galaxy!"". When Cleo and Michel leave, a few minutes later Vetti and his bodyguard/""lover?"" Ralph come and they hear the same prophecy as well. When they get back to the town Vetti finds Michel and is wanting to sword fight. Cleo steps in and finds himself in a deadlock tie sword fight with Vetti. Not being able to beat Vetti, Cleo and his crew who are comprised of Eimer (pronoused I-mer) the girl pilot of the glass ship. Nore (pronoused Nori) who is a communication specialist and analyst for the glass ship. Barrett an ex commander for the royal army and power control regulator for the glass ship. Last is Heizak (pronoused Hi Zak) he is the quite yet loud gun wielding shooter for the glass ship. Cleo wants to fight Vetti and knows who wins and kind of joins the people's army to fight Vetti and free the galaxy.

Pros: this show has very good voice dubbing, I feel that the voices are correct for each character. This show is 100% uncut and uncensored, there isn't very much swearing, there is some blood but nothing too gory.  The music is alright. The story is very good but sometime repetitive and at times confusing but mostly its straight forward and good. The characters are very good made up, adlest the ones who get on screen time.

Cons: Some of the characters backgrounds are total mysteries. Like 2/5th of the glass fleets crew is given a background story of some kind, the other is left to your imagination. Sometimes the story is predictable because it is pretty much space fight, talks about peace and more fights. The part I dislike the most the ending which I will NOT spoil but it leaves much to interpretation and the makers of this series COULD have made a second season but didn't.

Side note 1: this anime is heavily influenced around French renaissance era because of the names being pronounced  like French names. Along with the dresses and outfits that people wear it seems extremely French renaissance to me.

Side note 2: up above in my plot and characters description I put Ralph as Vetti's lover in quotation and question marks. In the series it is never stated outright but it seems like Vetti and Ralph were in love with each other because Ralph is always by Vetti's side and doing romantic gestures with Vetti saying romantic things back to Ralph and caring about him but no romance ever comes between them and they left as sort of far apart lovers yet non lovers.

Side note 3: this anime does NOT have a manga that it is based on, so people can't say that the manga was better because there is no manga to this show.

Over all: I liked this show very much! its a very good show and I wished they made a second season but I would say buy this series!!!",1473465600,,4380,4.401730531520395

First off there is no need to review the production or anime or packaging or anything else, no mater how good they may be or bad who cares!!??
 Spoiler alert!! Uuuughh I think I'm going to throw up. This has got to be one of the sickest series I have not been able to watch. This series had the basic story line that would be right up my ally, until the introduction of homosexual pediphililia. Homosexuality may be a personal thing. I will accept that, however I personaly have a strong aversion to it, and would rather not see a great plot drug through this kind of filth. The pediphile and rapist is built into the hero in the end with the support of even his victims! This thing is totally disgusting, and I had to skip through it to the end to see if the thing would even get a little straightened out, but no dice. This thig is a turd through and through. If you don't want to see a gay man ruin a galaxy while chasing the affections of a young boy, while at the same time throwing beautiful women to the side, yuck this thing is a total turd I tell you through and through to the end. I made the mistake of buying this thing without researching it very well and now I'll have to burn the thing to clear my concience. I am a bad man for even trying to watch this crapp, so learn from my mistake, if you do not like Gay Pedaphilia, DO NOT WATCHING THIS!!!",1400371200,,1372,4.138576779026217

The characters on the glass ship are likeable. The characters on the opposing side are likeable... Unfortunately the main character is just annoying and self loathing the entire time. I couldn't stand her whining about how she didn't think she was good enough most of the series. It gets really old really fast.
On a positive note, the series does wind up following a secondary character much closer and becomes more about him than anyone else.
I say give this a shot for the price and see for yourself if it is one to keep.
