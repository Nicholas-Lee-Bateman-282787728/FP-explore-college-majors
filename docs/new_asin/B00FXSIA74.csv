8619313,3,B00FXSIA74,"Very interesting story, some really amazing people (definitely glad Scout was in it, her acting was superb) linked to it.  But was hoping for a little more.  They had a lot of paths they could have took but I feel budgeting and time constrictions probably hurt the project.  Was worth the price and experience though.",1473292800,,317,4.7272727272727275

8619315,1,B00FXSIA74,"Tag is an original idea about 3 street kids who decide to play a game. Whoever injects the most HiV infected blood into other people wins control of their ""family."" Which consists of childhood friends and other runaways. They want people to start living every day like it's their last. They consider it a gift to have AIDS.

The female childhood friend conveniently falls for her new middle aged unemployed neighbor who also happens to volunteer as a counselor for the same runaway street kids. This move had way to many dots to connect to make a silly picture that you throw away instantly once you do. To many gaps, coincidences and lazy writing to sustain any believability.

The creepiest part of the movie is when the main lead and leader Billy pulls blood from his arm and puts into his black ink tatoo vile to use on unsuspecting patrons. Yuk. I won't be getting any new tattoos soon. I also wouldn't recommend this dumb bad cheesy movie to anybody either. But if you must then by all means tag your it.

There are tons of better movies about young messed up people to view instead. To name a few I would suggest the movie Kids, or that legendary 1984 movie Streetwise. Or even Superbad for Gods sake or that campy David Arquette classic called Johns. Thirteen is a great one and so is Ken Park. You won't be disappointed but I'm afraid if you watch Tag you will be.",1443225600,,1373,4.484
8619316,1,B00FXSIA74,"I had to stop watching this movie!  It's unfortunate in today's society that this really does happen.  Not exactly with a need but there are parties, especially in the gay community, where people go to get infected.  What a beyond crazy society we live in today ...",1431907200,,265,4.595744680851064
8619317,3,B00FXSIA74,"This film is about a bunch of misfit squatters with (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as Jacob and (Scout Taylor Compton) as Rae. The two main characters who are under the influence of a cult like leader named Billy (Patrick Allen Davis). Billy has been HIV positive since he was a child as we see through flashbacks.

Billy believes that if everyone were HIV positive they would not take life for granted and love life more. So he devices a game called Tag where he and all his minions see who can infect the most people by filling up syringes with their tainted blood and sticking people with them.

The acting was good although a bit over the top .There are a few story lines that intertwine and end up connecting. I found it entertaining but felt it suffered from bad direction and editing. It's very frightening to think this could and really does happen.

There is violence but no gore or any real horror elements except the scenerio itself. Although horror fans might get a kick out of seeing (Kane Hodder) as a bisexual John who picks up (Jacob) thinking he's a Hustler then ends up getting a syringe full of tainted blood jammed right in his bare butt while handcuffed to his bed
Take that Jason Voorhees and Victor Crowley!",1430179200,,1226,4.589041095890411
