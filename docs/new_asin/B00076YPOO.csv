8045271,4,B00076YPOO,"Bluegrass bass is a 2 DVD instructional video by Mark Schatz. The first couple of times that I viewed this video, I was totally disappointed.  Mark didn't provide a booklet with any of his playing suggestions. And he plays so fast...what a waste.  No additional material in provided outside the DVD. Both DVD's contain a mixture of information that is for the beginner and some other material for the intermediate. I am just starting the bass but was hoping Mark would take me to the next level. It could have been a GREAT DVD...

Both DVD are dark. I don't know what the issue was. The 1st not to bad, but the second was so dark that when Mark shows you the mike he's using in the bass ""F"" hole, you can't see it! What a boomer!

The Murphy Method Bluegrass Bass DVD`s are a great way to hit the ground running! You get the basics; learn bass runs, transitional notes, with songs that you can play along with. She goes step-by-step.

To understand the good stuff, you MUST know and understand musical terms such as 1st, 3rd, 6th, 7th, scales, and arpeggios, etc.  Even if you understand some music theory, (beginner?) it difficult to put it in musical context, timing, strings, etc. After playing, rewinding, and replaying, I managed to come away with some useful material, but what a struggle. He plays so fast that no one can follow. I'm not going to say not to purchase them but don't make them your first, second or third purchase. It's probably and good buy after you have mastered Murphy's instructional DVDs. Not for the beginner.",1366070400,,1538,4.574545454545454
8045272,5,B00076YPOO,This video is a little old but still very instructional.  Mark Schatz played with Nickel Creek prior to their breakup and he is a very accomplished player in many genres.,1240704000,,170,4.666666666666667
8045273,1,B00076YPOO,"I have used several video and books for many different instruments, and this is the worst thought out instructional video I have ever seen.  It is basically Schatz rambling on without any real plan.  He goes through things so quickly and disorganized that you can't follow it.  And since there is no book there nothing to go back to except trying to find the spot in the video again.  I found this incredibly frustrating.  After this one, I don't think I will ever buy an instructional video without a book to go along with it.  I feel like I have been had on this.  Definitely not worth the big price tag.",1235347200,,606,4.405405405405405
8045274,1,B00076YPOO,"This ""instructional"" video is a perfect example of the old adage that just because someone is good at something it doesn't mean they can teach it.  Schatz rambles on, does fancy things on the bass, spends almost NO time actually showing HOW a first-time BEGINNER bass player can do this.  And that's sort of the whole point of a BEGINNING BLUEGRASS BASS video, I'd think.

Schatz natters on and on without offering any exercises or specific direction that someone who was NOT classically trained can use.

For reference, I learned using The Murphy Method Bluegrass Bass video.  [...].  This got me up and running and confident fast.  I was hoping the Schatz video would help me move to the next level, and if I really try, I think I'll get SOMETHING out of it.  But a ""beginning"" lesson shouldn't be so vague.

If you want to spend two hours watching Mark Schatz tell you how he plays, without him actually showing you how YOU can play how he plays, then I'm sure you'll find this video just wonderful.  But if you really do want to learn to play bluegrass bass and you are a TRUE beginner, go to MURPHY.  It's dated and silly at points, but you WILL finish being able to play bluegrass bass at least.",1172016000,2,1201,4.488479262672811
