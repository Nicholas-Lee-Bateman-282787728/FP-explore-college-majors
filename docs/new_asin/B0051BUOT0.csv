8452512,3,B0051BUOT0,"""Men In Love"" is interesting because it involves a  philandering, Hetero-Married Man being seduced by an, obsessed, scheming SGL Man into a pretty torrid love affair.  Since this not the BEST way to start ANY kind of Romantic Relationship, let's just say things get REALLY complicated & just leave it at that!!!  ;-)

I knocked a  off, because of the DVD Presentation.  For one thing, it has a really ANNOYING Producer Logo & occasional Ad Scrolls that pop-up during the ENTIRE Movie!  Since I PAID for the DVD, I shouldn't have to be subjected to seeing all that DURING the FEATURE!!!

The OTHER was knocked-off because the SGL Sex Scenes were EDITED down to bare hints of action.  I KNOW this, as I have seen the ONLINE version, before this purchase.  I am OPPOSED to ANY form of CENSORSHIP for Adult Related Media.  If you, as an Adult, can't handle the SUBJECT Matter, then either Fast Forward, Close your Eyes, or more simply, this Material just might NOT be for YOU.

Other than that, the DVD did arrive on-time, & was in great condition.",1425081600,,1044,4.614130434782608
