8143911,1,B000I3Z810,"When I buy a commercially produced DVD, I expect to get the entire movie.  I am irate and greatly displeased that there are 7 minutes cut from this DVD, which has only 93 minutes instead of the full 100.  Sometimes, there are just little snippets cut, but there are places where entire scenes have been omitted.  I find this ludicrous and unacceptable.  If there were any other production company distributing this movie in its entirety, I'd buy that one and throw this one away.  Sadly, to my knowledge, there is no other version available.  At least one may find the complete movie at YouTube, even though the quality isn't perfect.",1461024000,3,634,4.718181818181818

8143916,5,B000I3Z810,"I remember when this came out on TV, 1990. I was thrilled. But not enough others were, as it lasted only about 5 or 6 series. It was so sweet and funny. He, a homeless man and the children who needed a ""grandpa"" adopted each other for mutual benefits. You never saw this side of Mitchum in his movies, except another TV movie, ""Promises to Keep"". I loved this TV series set. Not sure why people would rate the video one star, when they should have returned the DVD for a replacement if it didn't work.",1393027200,,501,4.229166666666667

8143918,1,B000I3Z810,The video get distorted and freezes but the audio is still playing.  I tried it in three different DVD players and freezes in the same spot every time. Rest of disc is unreadable.  The show it's self is a great story.,1338681600,,217,4.2682926829268295
8143919,4,B000I3Z810,"A Family For Joe stars Robert Mitchum in a role he usually wasn't cast in: a man caring for young ones. This movie depicts a family of children fighting to stay together. Robert Mitchum steps up to fill the role, reluctantly at first. Nice movie.",1291248000,3,246,4.488888888888889
