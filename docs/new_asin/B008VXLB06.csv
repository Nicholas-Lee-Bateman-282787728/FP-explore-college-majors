8531301,2,B008VXLB06,"This sucks. It started out okay, but when they start depicting the behavior of a pot smoker...shut up! I turned this off when it reminded me of 1980s weed documentaries. Totally unrealistic view of the lifestyled.",1507420800,,213,4.944444444444445
8531302,5,B008VXLB06,"Great story line! Very informitive of California weed scene. Will educate while entertaining you. A good film for all - no matter what side of the issue you are on.

8531304,5,B008VXLB06,"Fun, lighthearted film about what it's like to be a cannabis user in CA. Well worth watching-- Ix, the ""star"" of the film, is a real delight! Shows the ups and downs in a never too preachy way.",1417996800,,193,4.105263157894737
8531305,1,B008VXLB06,"Not very good for a stoner documentary, it mainly follows an overly theatrical spazzy attention seeking girl, who's mildly hot at best.  I'd recomend Super High Me or a stoner comedy instead.",1370304000,3,191,4.96875
