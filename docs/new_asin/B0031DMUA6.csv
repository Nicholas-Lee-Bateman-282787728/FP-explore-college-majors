8386877,5,B0031DMUA6,I purchase this set for my husbands birthday at a great price.  I liked it because I was able to buy him 2 seasons instead of just one.,1303689600,,135,3.8214285714285716
8386878,5,B0031DMUA6,"Not much to say in a review of this product, except that if you are a fan of this TV series, you will appreciate the early years of programming.  If you are not a CI fan, then you will not be interested and probably won't even be reading any reviews of it.

 There are four 45 minute episodes per DVD and it provides a perfect ""filler"" on most evenings when there is ""nothing"" to watch on TV.

 Have been a long time fan of this show and am anticipating it's return in 2011 for a final season with the original cast.

8386879,5,B0031DMUA6,If you're a fan of great cime dramas then this is for you. To me this is somewhat in the same vain as Columbo. You pretty much know who the killer is but it's watching Vincent D'Onofrrio's chactter (Robert Goren) solving it pice by pice thats the treat. To me he didn't hit his stride until the second season but it's important to see how he began to understand how his mind works as an actor and how the chacter evolves. I highly recomend this set along with all the others. Enjoy,1280793600,,481,4.239130434782608
8386880,5,B0031DMUA6,I absolutely love this series and Vincent D'Onofrio's character.  The seasons are usually pretty pricey but this was Season 1 & 2.  I am very pleased.,1278460800,,150,4.730769230769231
8386881,5,B0031DMUA6,"What a shame that this thinking persons show was cancelled.  I hope NBC/USA regret it very soon.  The replacements for D'Onofrio and Erbe are talented but out of the ""Goren"" element.  They brought  a great relationship and respectful working partnership to an art form.  It will never be the same and we will never know how things worked out with Goren's mental status. Its definitely the best of the 3 and the other two cannot compete in my opinion.  SVU deals with darker emotions and gets long in the tooth after awhile.  Some of the characters are boring and irritating.  The original with Sam Waterston is also a great show.. Thank God I have my DVD's from Amazon to watch Bobby and Alex.  Goodbye Bobby and Alex, I will really miss you!!!!!!!!!  Shame on you, NBC/USA",1274140800,4,773,4.617647058823529
8386882,5,B0031DMUA6,"You will either love or hate this show. I hate to see all of my favorite characters gone but ""Bobby"" will continue to be my beloved. With three ""Law & Orders"" to choose from, this was by far the best!!!!!",1273795200,,204,4.125
