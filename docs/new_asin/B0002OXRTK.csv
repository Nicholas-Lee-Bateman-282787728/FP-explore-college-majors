8030156,5,B0002OXRTK,"These are a few of his greatest works.  He was a great film star that captured the audience with his looks, charm and ability.",1356307200,,126,4.25
8030157,5,B0002OXRTK,"""The Wild One"" and ""On the Waterfront"" are by now, considered classics in the Marlon Brando filmography, together with the lesser known ""The Men"", which launched him, and the masterpiece ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", adapted from the stage play by Tennessee Williams.

The transfer on DVD is fair, not exceptional, but fair. But due to the age of these two movies, it is already a miracle they look and feel, the way they do.

But the DVDs help preserve for a long time to come, two of the best performances Brando ever gave, and that helped him leap to international, if not worldwide fame.

There are no major special features, but this should not scare anybody off, since the movies alone speak volumes by themselves.

One major improvement, compared to previous editions, including VHS versions, is the sound.
This time you get sharp and clear dialogues and the music is not overbearing as in some of the earlier versions.

""On the Waterfront"" also offers you great and solid performances by other great actors, such as Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden, Rod Steiger and Eva Marie Saint.
This in itself, is a gift to those who love great group acting.

For this price, they are almost a give away and you are sure to enjoy two of the best examples of how movies can be done on a budget, without having to lose out on quality.

I can only strongly recommend these two, in tandem or by themselves.",1252713600,,1388,4.5951417004048585
8030158,5,B0002OXRTK,"Unlike a lot of other bundles around, this one is actually worthwhile. Say what you like about Brando, but there was a time when he was doing something with acting that has rarely been seen since. I believe the reason Brando was so good in those early years was because he was just so excited by the possibilities and of his own talent. But the problem with genius is it soon gets bored..

Regardless, On The Waterfront is brilliant - mostly due to Brando, but also his co-stars. It's such a shame Brando couldn't get past his ego and not sit with Steiger for Steiger's closeups in their famous car scene - because Steiger's role and character's story is as important as Brando's.

The Wild One is a lovely snap-shot of 'middle' America caught in the grip of hysteria about youth that has happened again and again throughout history. This time it's those crazed potheads and drunks riding their motorcycles, refusing to call people ""Sir"", and questioning authority. Forgot about Brando's reply of ""Whaddya got?"", look for the moments where he shows fragility - there's the magic. Not in the same class as Streetcar or Waterfront - but along with those two it forms a tight trilogy of films that should be in every collection.",1167782400,4,1225,4.693023255813953

Thanks!",1127433600,,77,4.133333333333334
