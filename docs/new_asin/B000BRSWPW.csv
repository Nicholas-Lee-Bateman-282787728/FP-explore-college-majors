8091656,5,B000BRSWPW,So this DVD was our last of Shawns line dance series we got with this 6 pack deal and we were really impressed with the overall speed and instruction style he used.  On this and the other smokin volume 1 he goes a bit quicker and this is perfect as we knew exactly what to do.  The higher pace also allows him to get a lot more content into the video.  Overall great DVD!,1399507200,,371,3.9864864864864864
8091657,1,B000BRSWPW,"Glad I checked it out from the library first! Definitely NOT a ""learn to dance"" DVD! He goes way too fast to learn anything! And WAY TOO many complicated moves!!!! Not for beginners.",1387152000,,182,4.545454545454546
8091658,5,B000BRSWPW,"This is a great video for anyone to learn to line dance. It also helps you refresh some of the basic steps if you haven't been danceing recently. (Me) Don't be afraid to add to the dance that is what makes line dancing fun, do stay with the tried and true add a little flare to stand out in a crowd.",1253232000,,299,3.918032786885246
8091659,5,B000BRSWPW,"I love this DVD, and the others I have also! Shawn Trautman shows a few steps and then reviews them to make sure you have plenty of chances to practice. I'm telling all my friends to buy this DVD so they can learn the more complicated line dances. This is more fun exercise than going to the gym!",1164412800,6,296,4.120689655172414
