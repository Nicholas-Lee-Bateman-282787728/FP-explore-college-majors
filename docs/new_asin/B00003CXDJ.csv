1264777,4,B00003CXDJ,Wonder Boys is one of those movies that you have to get used to. Maybe a second viewing is required for this one. People with little tesion spands will have a hard time dealing with all that is going on and believing me there is allot going on. But the preformances are really great especially from Tobey Maguire. And the film just gives you a sense of fun and a whole lot of quirkiness. The real thing about Wonder Boys that stands out is it's plots and its twists and turns and remember that all this occurs in one weekend. Yes I know a really wreked one at that too.,982540800,,569,4.181818181818182
1264778,4,B00003CXDJ,"If you put all the oddballs together within a tight span of one weekends, Wonder Boys is the result.  As readers have read from other reviews, the movie was about the main character, Tripp (Michael Douglas), a college professor who came out with a best-selling novel and now, he's onto his second one but the problem was that he couldn't see to finish it.  Could it be mental block, or something else?  His publisher, impressively played by Robert Downey Jr. was on the verge of losing his job & badly needed something good to kick start his career.  Therefore, he came to town to see Tripp and along the way, he brought along his transvetite friend.  Tripp happened to be fascinated with one of his students, Tobey McGuire's character who was tragically talented.  Then, there's Katie Holmes, from Dawson Creeks who was in her second major pictures (after The Gift) as an infatuated student to Tripp who boarded at his place.  After an accident shooting of a blind dog, Tripp, the publisher, the students' lives were all intertwined together in a hillarious roller coaster ride.  Frances McDermott (of the Fargos) played Tripp's mistress who was pregnant with his child.  What complicated the issue was France's character was already a married woman.  Towards the end, Tripp finally saw clearly what he wanted in life and only then, everybody seemed to come together in their rightful places.  Then, there's also Marilyn Monroe's jacket, Joe Dimaggio's baseball, an chicken-eyed Indian, a waitress and Tripp's rundown car....what did they have to do with the story?  Believe me, you would want to know.  Highly recommended.",982368000,3,1624,4.970370370370371
1264779,4,B00003CXDJ,"You'd think that ""L.A. Confidential"" was a tough act to follow. But director Curtis Hanson takes it in stride with his follow-up, ""Wonder Boys"". An adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel that is pretty far removed from ""Confidential"", and yet, manages to be equally compelling and uniquely sedutive on its own.
Much of it is probably owed to Michael Douglas. In a refined, carefully controlled performance the actor packs on some 30 pounds and looks totally dishevelled as a burned out college professor with a fondness for marihuana.
Douglas' perfect portrayal completely carries the film. It is, in essence, a melancholic comedy. Hanson and the screenwriter use this mood to set-up some very interesting situations and present very unusual characters. The situations are aided by Dante Spinotti's captivating cinematography. And at some instances, things get so bizarre and madcap that you might think you're watching a Coen Brothers movie. Particularly in a very mean-spirited subplot involving the fate of a blind pit bull, and in a wildly amusing scene involving a car accident and Douglas' work in progress. I think of it as psychological slapstick comedy. The thinking man's pie-in-the-face. The story is riddled with stuff like this that borders on the absurd but is presented as matter-of-factly as possible.
The whole thing with Douglas' female student played by Katie Holmes, for instance. He rents her a room in his house. She clearly has a deep crush on him. And the irony here is that in a strange way this ends up being a parody of the cinematic sexual escapades that Douglas is known for... In another movie, he might have succumbed to her seductions, but he plays a very different low-key character here. Holmes plays the part perfectly too. After seeing her give such assured performances in off-beat films like this, ""The Ice Storm"" and the underrated gem ""Go"", I find it hard to believe that ""Dawson's Creek"" is her day job. In some ways she's evry bit as daring and accomplished as her more ""prestigious"" contemporary Cristina Ricci.
But the real choice stuff lies elsewhere. Downey Jr's extremely likable character is a delicious treat to watch. When he develops a crush on Maguire it's actually pretty endearing. I like the tasteful way that this movie handles the ""love affair"" between Downey and Maguire. Some other movie might have exploited it as a chance to be ""daring"" and ""controversial."" Here, the fact is treated with naturalistic ease. Seeing Maguire and Downey lying in bed together with their shirts off is not geared to raise eyebrows. It's a positive plot point about genuine affection, handled with warmth and jolly humor.
And finally, an energetic subplot within a subplot involving a pregnant waittress named Oola (the underused beauty Jane Adams) and a neurotic James Brown lookalike named Vernon (hilariously played by Richard Knox) This entire block of the film feels like vintage Coen. With delightful off-center dialogues and moments of potentially lethal suspense handled with farcical sitcom glee.
But, ultimately, the film gets by on its honest human emotions and it's the relationships that are at the heart of the film. The relationship between Douglas and Frances McDormand rings true, all the more aided by McDormand's heartfelt performance. And once Douglas begins to serve as a kind of father figure for Maguire it's even more moving. It could be that Maguire creates a character that projects vulnerability with intelligence. The film has many memorable moments with him at the center. I was eerily mesmerized in a scene where he alphabetically goes through a list of all the Hollywood movie stars that have committed suicide. There is a darkness there but at the same time, the scene has poignancy and it is the foreshadow to a touching scene involving Maguire's fascination with the coat Marilyn Monroe wore on her wedding day.
Curtis Hanson has proven himself as a classy filmmaker. Gone are the days of plastic popcorn entertainment like ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"". With ""L.A. Confidential"" and now this, he has proven to be a meticulous and intelligent filmmaker that is very aware of the nuances of elegant cinematic storytelling and he knows how to work sensibly within the Hollywood system. It's rare to see a mainstream Hollywood film that isn't all that mainstream. ""Wonder Boys"" is a highly enjoyable and ultimately sober dramatic comedy with intelligence and truth... I even like the questionable fact that it boldly attempts to ultimately be an anti-drug parable. Hanson handles that point so subtly, that you won't feel as patronized as you should.",978739200,35,4621,5.0895915678524375
1264780,5,B00003CXDJ,"Wonder Boys, Curtis Hanson's sublime follow-up to his critically acclaimed LA Confidential, is a film that grows on you slowly.  Douglas and his stellar supporting cast parade across the screen and what initially seems like a tad off-kilter drama builds into an involving, entertaining romp.  From Douglas' drug-hazed professor to the ""hood jumper"" to Maguire's somber, odd, eager young pupil, Wonder Boys characters are some of the best to hit the screen since Soderbergh's magnificent ""Out of Sight.""  Each character has a function and comes across as fully developed (save for possibly Katie Holmes).  By the end of this film, this viewer was left hoping the credits would not roll and these fun, eccentric, coat-stealing, dog-killing, transvestite-loving characters would never leave the screen.
Enough good things cannot be said about this quirky, fun, intelligent film.  Ideally Wonder Boys will be remembered come Oscar time.",978566400,4,932,5.444444444444445
1264781,2,B00003CXDJ,"Michael Douglas's Grady Tripp in  *Wonder Boys*  has a pile of troubles:  1)  his wife decamped,  2)  his mistress, the Chancellor of the small college where he teaches, is pregnant,  3)  his literary agent is demanding to see his novel-in-progress called  ""The Arsonist's Daughter"", which, at 2,000+  pages, is STILL unfinished,  4)  a young attractive female student has a crush on him,  5)  another of his students, a troubled young writer named James Leer, is having some sort of breakdown,  6)  there's a dead dog in his trunk . . . on and on it goes.  After a brilliant career as noir director, Curtis Hanson goes abruptly  ""lit'ry"", and I can't say that the change is for the best.  Taken from Michael Chabon's novel, *Wonder Boys*  is lacking in the stuff that made Hanson's other films so good:  namely, crime.  So he makes do with what's available:  there's a lot of pot-smoking; a touch of breaking-and-entering  (combined with the pot-smoking); a bit of gun-play  (hence the dead dog in the trunk of the car); even adultery.  I don't know if it's the source material -- not having read the novel -- or Hanson's interpretation of it, but the events herein seem as if they're pumped for maximum slam-bang value.  I mean, there's even, inexplicably, a transvestite on the premises.  All of this is going on during some sort of literary convention taking place at the college called  ""WordFest"".  Having attended soirees like this, I can tell you first-hand that transvestites do not attend bookchat festivals, and for that matter, the attendees are far more prosaic than the loonies in this movie.  All this might have rang more true if Hanson had toned things down, but, considering his past work which tells stories of people living on the edge, this might not have been possible.
At least the superb supporting cast provides relief.  Frances McDormand, Rip Torn, Tobey Maguire, and of course Robert Downey Jr.  make the most of their opportunities.  Unfortunately, the disappointment proves to be Michael Douglas.  Physically, he seems to be channeling Sally Jesse Raphael.  Acting-wise, it's all too clear that he is -- with great effort -- holding alter-ego Gordon Gekko firmly in check.  It's a way of saying he's unconvincing as a slobby English professor who loves pot and Neil Young records.
I've heard that the studio re-released this picture recently, doubtless for consideration at Oscar-time.  Well, *Wonder Boys*  disappeared without a trace last February, which should have given the studio heads a hint:  it wasn't all that good.  In December, it's STILL not all that good.",977356800,2,2598,4.935034802784223
1264782,4,B00003CXDJ,"'Wonder Boys' a term ocassionally used to describe first time, usually young authors who write great books and often have trouble duplicating the success, is a flawed film which completely won me over because of some perfectly realized moments, good ensemble acting and a stand-out Robert Downey Jr. performance.
The film which was attrociously marketed as a cute Michael Douglas comedy,and just recently enjoyed a limited re-release with little notice.  Pity, because it is one of the best films of the year.
Female characters get short shrift in this essentially two character study about an over-the-hill anxiety ridden, pot smoking 50 year old College professor and a strange, almost withdrawn young student author.
There are several true to life moments that are perfectly captured on film that utterly and completely won me over.  The almost fairy-tale like ending, and some minor but annoying inacuracies are minor flaws the film easily overcomes.  The film contains a couple of beautifully realized scenes which I will treasure for a long long time.  There's also a very impressive soundtrack which is used quite admirably during the film.  A Neil Young Classic punctuates a scene obviously but so perfectly, I wanted to just stand up and go...  Yes, that's the way to do it.
Michael Douglas, and Tobey Maguire are the leads, but Robert Downey Jr. as Douglas' (Grady's) Agent is superb in another go-for-broke, swing for the bleachers performance. It may be his best performance ever (and he's given some incredible ones in the past).
The film is a laid back, casually-paced character study. It's not an action film or a dumb comedy but a film that takes its time and gets most of its details right. It's a film about inner conflicts, relationhships, self doubt and relationships that usually feels authentic and true.  A few details seem maddeningly wrong, but they are minor and one of my nit-picks --regarding Grady-a professional writer single spacing his manuscript which is a real tabu of editors)--is actually how the writer of the novel and his wife have submitted material to editors in rea life supposedly without dire consequences.
Hopefully you'll get the opportunity to view the film without knowing too much about the films minor twists and turns.
It's easy to see why Curtis Hanson was attracted to this story about creative types questioning their abilities and confidence to continue in their chosen field.  Hanson leap frogged from a reputation as a competent border-line hack director of such better than average thrillers as The Bedroom Window, Bad Influence ,The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild into a first class skilled a-list director with 1997's L.A.  Confidential.
For his follow-up Hanson chose a quieter, more introspective and even riskier film;  The Wonder Boys.
It's far from perfect but I suspect it will easily make my 10 best of 2000.

1264783,3,B00003CXDJ,"Well, this is a very enjoyable film, but when you get home you'll start picking holes in it.
The biggest hole by far is Michael Douglas. Having read the book, to me he plays the character of Grady all wrong. He's too ""Michael Douglas"" for a start, overdoes the cute comedy act, looks just too unappealing for us to believe that the Chancellor could be interested in him.
And there are clumsy moments, like when the book falls out of the car, and scenes that are electrifying in the novel and thrown away in the film. They even missed out one of the best sequences...
Robert Downey Jr is excellent though, and the interplay between him and the James Leer character is very well done. And the Pittsburgh backdrop is atmospheric and a bit different.

But I was disappointed. Wonder Boys is a movie trying to paint a portrait of an author who is sinking deeper and deeper into the swamp that the success of a book of his, and he himself, have created. But the movie never really finds its own story. It sorts of wanders around in unfinished sideplots and klich-marked details.
It's a pity. Still, there are some pretty good jokes in Wonder Boys, and if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday, it won't be a waste of time to go see it.",974764800,2,662,4.390243902439025

1264943,4,B00003CXDJ,"It seems like every film that the late (sniff) Curtis Hanson made ""wasn't a perfect fit"" except his masterpiece, L.A. Confidential. I have been doing a mini Hanson retrospective since he sadly passed away last week. First, LAC on Blu Ray (great); second, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (really good, but seems like it was a job for him, more than anything). Wonder Boys bears a closer affinity with Confidential. Although the screenplay was written by the very able Steve Kloves (of Harry Potter adaptation fame) it is the original source material novel by Michael Chabon which drives this goofy/serious dramedy. And that story is centered around a flailing novelist, played to natty perfection by Michael Douglas working in an English Department - teaching, to pay the bills while he labors over his second novel. His first was a hit. Sound like a bit of a Trope? It is, but with muted photography and marvelous performances all around, Wonder Boys I think exceeds its story a bit. I can't figure out whether Tobey Maquire's turn as a savant creative writing student who may just be the next Tripp (yes, that is the main character's name) is brilliant, or a mess. It is always interesting to look at. Again, the main event is Douglas, and he does not disappoint. As it did with critics, this will divide viewers: some will like or love it (as I did) and others will say ""WTF."" That's OK. R.I.P. Curtis Hanson.",1475020800,2,1410,4.712550607287449

(I taught at one college where two senior divorced faculty members were shacked up with students, or former students and a third was fired for trading grades for 'favors' from female students.  He was caught only because uninvolved female students complained.)  You could not go to a faculty function (party) without seeing dope outside everywhere and single faculty, male and female, showing up with students as dates.  It was a test of your coolness, tolerance, liberalness to go along with it.  If you didn't pass, you simply would be excluded - from everything, or not rehired.

Professional issues, personal problems...
Tobey McGuire is great as James Leer (anyone feel a Shakespeare connotation with the character's last name?), the troubled, but gifted young student who Grady takes under his wing...both as a mentor and friend.
Robert Downey Jr is great as Grady's editor Terry Crabtree. RDJ has had a troubled past, but you have to hand it to him...he's a good actor.
Supporting roles from Katie Holmes and Rip Torn also suit quite nicely, as a student who is renting a room from Grady  (Katie Holmes) and a fellow rival novelist  (Rip Torn)

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

There were great expectations for 'Wonder Boys'. You can even hear Michael Douglas say on the DVD extras that this was an opportunity to play a more substantial part, much different from what he terms ""prince of darkness"" roles he had recently been known for. Nonetheless, here was a film that was released a SECOND time, after it initially bombed at the box office (the second release, by the way, fared no better).

Perhaps the biggest reason for 'Wonder Boys' failure, was the source material: the novel of the same name, written by the young wunderkind, Michael Chabon. Michiko Kakutani perhaps said it best, describing the novel in her 1995 NY Times review, as ""silly and verging on camp."" Although I disagree with her assessment that the film had a ""split personality,"" with the story being also ""touching and melancholy.""

Screenwriter Steve Kloves' faithfully adapts Chabon's story and retains the same sorry schematics: in a nutshell, the protagonist, Professor Grady Tripp, has no significant antagonist to play off of. This might work better in a novel, where the characters' internal arc is highlighted, but in a full-length feature film, it's deadly. Tripp is basically the pot-smoking loser who can't replicate his earlier literary success and also can't decide whether he wants to commit to the University Chancellor, Sara Gaskell, now pregnant with his child. Gaskell is married to Tripp's boss, Walter, chairman of the English Department.

Peripheral characters seem to drift in and out of view during the film with little or no identifiable purpose including a young Katie Holmes as Hannah Green, both Tripp's student and boarder as well as Tripp's literary agent, Terry Crabtree (played by a younger Robert Downey Jr.), whose career is also falling apart (mainly due to Tripp's inability to come up with a new novel).

The bulk of 'Wonder Boys' concerns Tripp's relationship with the dissolute James Leer (a very, very young Tobey Maguire), one of Tripp's students who aspires to be a writer. A singular event ruins the entire movie when Leer shoots Walter's dog and the bumbling Tripp places the carcass in the trunk of his car for most of the rest of the film. Somehow, Chabon and Kloves believes that the shooting of the poor pooch is supposed to be funny. My theory is that talk about this most unpleasant event got around and accounted for the very poor response at the box office. Clue for future film scenarists: don't allow one of your main characters to kill a dog, if you want people to like your movie!!!

The rest of the machinations in the film are only briefly worth mentioning. Suffice it to say that after Leer shoots the Gaskell's pet, he also makes off with the Chairman's precious Marilyn Monroe memorabilia. At a certain point, Terry ends up in bed with James and then Tripp's car turns out to be stolen and is repossessed by its rightful owner (a crazy black dude who resembles a cross between James Brown and Little Richard).

The repulsive Leer is saved after Tripp makes a deal with Walter, arranging for Terry to publish his book, described as a ""critical exploration of the union of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe and its function in American mythopoetics"", tentatively titled The Last American Marriage."" The dig at academia could have been developed quite a bit more, but the scenarists here fail to go in that direction. And as for Tripp, the loss of his manuscript signals the shattering of all of his illusions.

Tripp's ultimate fate is indicative of Chabon's (and Kloves') failure to do anything creative with their protagonist. Tripp, the perennial procrastinator, finally decides to make the obvious commitment (which we can see a mile away from the very beginning), where he decides to shack up with Sara and play the responsible role of the good father (a significantly SENTIMENTAL ending for a film billed as some sort of black comedy).

Granted, Michael Douglas does the best he can in a role where his character simply doesn't develop. At least (as he says), this time he's not playing the ""prince of darkness."" The rest of the cast also do the best they can with the limited material but the chief highlight here is merely seeing how notable actors (Downey, Maguire, Holmes and McDormand) looked as their pre-9/11 selves.

'Wonder Boys' truly has little to say about human nature since its quirky characters are distantly related to how real people think and feel. Most disappointing is the film's campy humor, which sometimes veers into excessively unpleasant terrain (yes, I'll bring up the dead dog one more time!). Remember that many films with an 'indie' appellation, do not necessarily come close to 'art', despite assorted critics' claims to the contrary.",1409702400,2,4789,4.929280397022333
1265354,2,B00003CXDJ,"What a shame this was not done better as I usually LOVE films about writers and the writing process.  Fantastic cast and at first, an interesting story that drags on through a lot of bad weather and inappropriate behavior by a teacher including giving pot and alcohol to his students.  If you have any hopes of a character coming back from that you are going to have to work much harder then they did in this film.  The cast list should have been able to save this but they had too many obsticles.  For example,  the weather is so bad in every scene of this film that it upstages things.  Not a lot happens very quickly here making me lose interest and concern.  Then,  I simply felt too cold and damp to care anymore..",1409529600,,719,4.313432835820896

It amazes me to see how well Michael Douglas can act without the Brooks Brother suit and sophistication of Hollywood. He is very believable as the pot smoking Professor, who is having a sweet affair with Frances Dormand and trying to hide from the blind Pit bull of her husband. Robert Downy Jr. could not have been better, as he arrives in town with a beautiful 6 foot Transvestite to confer with the professor about a much needed sequel to his book. Toby McGuire , now It was my first time seeing him and he plays a dark genius with suicidal tendencies at least that what he wants you to believe. And the rest of the cast is no less great. They all work seamlessly with each other. Michael Douglas has said it was reported that he thought this was his best film and was so disappointed that the film community did not see that for some reason.

1265883,5,B00003CXDJ,"Oh my god this movie was something.  My son had me watch it, telling me I'd really like it, and he was right, so right.  Oh my God, I can't remember laughing so hard, getting so engaged, and really feeling for characters in a movie.  I've had individual movies, do each of those things.  I've had movies that were non stop laugh riots, but, I never really connected with the characters.  I've had movies where each character felt like a best friend, and I didn't want anything to happen to them, but, I wasn't laughing through those movies.  This movie has everything, love, romance, comedy, adultery, a dead dog, a transvestite, an endless manuscript, and I believe a tuba... how many movies have a tuba.

Reading the negative reviews, I know the movies aren't for everyone, some people will not enjoy them, some people will find it dull and uninteresting, and that's okay.  This is the type of movie that if it's your type of movie, if you connect with the characters, if you enjoy the story, it's something you can curl up with, like a good book, watch, and enjoy.  It will lift your mood, it will bring you hope, and it will make you feel good and look at Michael Douglas in awe.

It's not a perfect movie, but, it is a great movie.

I thought the Michael Douglas Katie Holms student teacher thing would be more of a factor... but it was mostly about the Michael Douglas character (a successful writer who's teaching at a school and hasn't published a book in a long time) trying to help a very dark student writer (Tobey McGuire) who is very manipulative... Michael Douglas's publisher (Robert downey) shows up and is somewhat entertaining... but the relationships between the characters were just too odd for me to relate to.  All the characters had such severe character flaws that they were just depressing to watch... there was no hero or heroine or any character I could remotely relate to.  An aspiring writer might like this movie, but it was too strange for me.",1339632000,4,874,4.723684210526316
1265885,5,B00003CXDJ,"A very original and unique film very well regarded with douglas performance masterful and a minor character his orphan like son who is nicely pictured. The film is seen through a writers life,his perceptions thoughts and relationships...and there have been hardly any films like this. At first we have a pregnant mistress and a dead dog and a dead doctor's dog,with the police interested in the doctor's dog...with all kinds of wry comments directed here. We also have a party,a party of writers and nicely done conversations briefly on a writers life and a series of suicides,the link between creation and artistry and suicide, and the orphan son here(orphan as in being abandoned)gives a long series of artists who have succumbed to death,famous and enigmatic deaths like superman icon george reeves to those suffering madness like the once famous gene tierney, and living lonely and isolated lives. Loneliness and isolation are themes here. An image that appears throughout is joe dimaggio and marilyn..its only mr coffee,n,y. joe who really understands and loves marilyn(although they were married less than a year) but his love lasted until the very end,of not only her life but his own,a transcending like experience and hollywood itself was never really good to marilyn in all kinds of ways,even absenting itself from her funeral(ill write more on this when i review a recent book),but n.y. joe appears at her funeral. N.Y. is seen as a center of artistic growth and maturity
and probably a source of much good film which is often forgotten,but it is the yankees imaged throughout,and the artists but the civic authorities evidenced are largely absent. The writer leaves his wife and his former wife in a brief scene(woman rarely appear) leaves him to his new found 'young beautiful' mate. Throughout the film in a past reference somewhat anachronistically the characters use the epithets 'jesus,..christ' which is not heard from much here. There is also a brief scene with a tony...and a tuba in a trunk...the oddness of the writer'slife. Throughout the film appears the further development of the murder of the dog,and the civic authorities here concentrated on what's important to the doctor,and there are scenes of the orphan son james addictions(not to mention douglas' addictions)..and the father exhorting addiction like soon youll be munching boxes of cardboard your mind is so addict like...perhaps a reference to upcoming youth. The Douglas character looks with favour to christmas morning,
with a show viewed on the 'trick of self development'...a play on the word trick to a more spiritual plain...then the movie ends with the orphan boys book being published 'the love parade' a commentary on themes throughout...and a closing with Wlaton's actor richard thomas chronicolling his new book 'marilyn-joe the last american marriage' since love has lost its permanence in the old institution...and a woman laments on Douglas new book with its geneologies(like jesus geneologies) as being the work of an 'addict.' At the end the douglas character loses wife and everything and must start over...but does have a clarifying vision...the artists view...interesting look at life seen from the vantage point of a writer with views implicit on many things,and entertaining throughout..",1337212800,,3294,5.240530303030303

In an upstairs apartment in the building in which he lives is a most attractive young woman, who has the hots for him; problem, she is one of his undergraduate students. One of his other students is the most talented writer he has had in his writing class in years, a writer who has, in fact, already completed a manuscript; problem, the student has formed an attachment for him based both on his teaching and, more importantly, on his novel which was a life changing experience, and the student is a masterful weaver of tales about  himself, in addition, to reacting weirdly under the influence  of the alcohol and drugs, Professor Douglas introduces him to. This tangled web is even more tangled by the arrival of his publishers agent, a long time friend, who is desperate for him to finish a second novel, long overdue, which he cannot complete. What ensues from this unholy mess is both funny and touching. Douglas, as Professor, Downey as friend, Bosco as student, all perform with real class, while Frances McDermond, as chancellor and lover, also does a fine job.

1265888,5,B00003CXDJ,"I don't exactly know what it is but this movie has something magic to it. Its not my typical horror or fantasy movies, its not an action movie either but i wouldn't just tag it as a drama cause there's a lot more than that to it. I think its a really beautiful Film with a bunch of great actors and a very special story line!!

This one is about the world of writers and authors. We get to see how this world works and how can a writer be inspired enough to write a good story and what will motivate him and keep him inspired throughout good and bad times. I think this story was written by Michael Chabon, it was adapted from his book ""Wonder Boys"".

The story is about Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas), he's a literature teacher who's trying to help his students becoming good writers and authors by helping them understand other people and  other writers of all genre  and how to be inspired by  finding out who they  are exactly as human beings and what keeps them inspired  happy and ready to go forward in life. In his class there is James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes) who are both ready to become Authors and very happy to work with Professor Tripp as he's a Legendary writer for both of them. Hannah already have lots of talent but she will soon have to deal with other realities of life as her feelings for Professor Trip will force her to change her behaviour. James (Tobey) is the reject of the class as all his classmate are making fun of him because of his weird and strange behaviour, the stories he writes are also very strange and hard to understand but everyone will soon discover that he really is the best and has a huge potential for being a really good author, with the help of Professor Trip, he will learn how life works and how to connect with himself.

The performances by the actors are all awesome: KATIE HOLMES, MICHAEL DOUGLAS, TOBEY MAGUIRE and especially ROBERT DOWNEY JR. The cinematography is just perfect and the soundtrack is amazing. NEIL YOUNG and BOB DYLAN'S songs seem to fit the whole movie extremely well and gives a really beautiful  and magic touch to the movie. Perfect for the holidays!! There is also some very funny moments  in the movie where you will really have a good laugh.....lot's of random things you Won't expect....I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie and especially anyone who's interested in the world of writers and authors.

1266097,5,B00003CXDJ,"I first found this film in a small video store in Virginia Beach and bought it on a whim. I look back at that day as a solid stroke of luck, being at the right place and time. The theme of Wonder Boys concerns the intricacies of life after having had an initial success and not being sure if one can reclaim their former glory. As a novelist, editor, or even the city of Pittsburgh itself these characters are uncertain on how to become successful once again. Michael Douglas heads up this ensemble, playing the character of a burnt out college professor who had once written a best selling book. He plays the role with a good deal of charisma and wit. Whether he is narrating or on-screen, his voice is an universally enjoyable experience . Toby Maguire plays the role of a sensitive young writer, unsure about his life and future, but having a strong love of literature and a desire to become a novelist. The role fits Maguire well. Frances McDormand is the head of Micheal Douglas' department at the university and is having an affair, I don't want to give away the plot so that is all I will say about that. Katie Holmes is serviceable as a literature hottie and one of Douglas' star students. The shining star of the cast for me though was Robert Downey Jr. He plays Douglas' New York book editor and longtime friend. As it is with most of Downey's roles, he is outstanding. His dialog is crisp and clean and he is endlessly entertaining. Downey's character is not the focus of the movie, but he plays off of Douglas and Maguire extremely well. This movie is neither an action packed romp nor is it a dark and brooding epic. Wonder Boys portrays the lives of literary artists, professors and students in a realistic manner. The city of Pittsburgh with its many haunting and decaying bridges serve as both a backdrop for Douglas' character as well as a metaphor for his, Maguire's, and Downey's reality.",1319328000,,1907,4.546511627906977

1266099,4,B00003CXDJ,"A real overlooked gem of a dramedy that features one of Michael Douglas best, most refreshing performances. Instead of playing yet another in his long (and increasingly tired) line of angry, bitter, often wealthy white males, Douglas here plays an often bemused, occasionally baffled, frequently stoned college professor going through a funny variation of the mid-life crisis.

The film follows his (mis)adventures over a narrow period of time as he vainly struggles to finish a mammoth novel. Eccentric characters and hijinks ensue. But wait - that description may sound sarcastic, but while the filmmakers were clearly going for the quirky factor here, they never seem to labor too hard, and the result never feels forced. Indeed, the whole film unfolds in a natural, charming, very funny way. It may, generally speaking, wind up where you thought it was going at the start, but it may not arrive there in quite the way you thought it would.",1310169600,,943,5.044871794871795

1266103,5,B00003CXDJ,"This film has taken a slot in my top ten films of wonderment.
The casting is superb which leads to really entertaining storytelling. I chose to watch this film based upon the considerably talented cast, director/Curtis Hanson as well as Executive Producer/Ned Dowd. The film is so literate and presented to the audience so as to read like a Book -Of-The-Month-Club. There are many references to literature American and world and the cast pulls this film along with some of the best comedic acting I have yet to experience coming from a machine driven and crazed  American film atmosphere.
Just look at the cast and ask yourself,  'could this be fun to watch?' The answer is a big YES.
I am not going to make comparisons to my favorite 3 films right now because they are all of different genres. But here is a tip: ""Wonder Boys"", ""The Big Bounce"" and ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"" with Daniel Craig.
Now many of you are going to chuckle about including ""The Big Bounce"" but again look at the cast, the setting and goofy story as well as twists and turns. 'Bounce' came along at just the right time for me. I needed to laugh and this crew will certainly do that for you. This is where I came to appreciate Owen Wilson's talents as well as Sarah Foster's marvelous walk down Oahu's North Shore beach in her bikini. ""Flashbacks"" is a serious look at a mans' life as he turns up in Hollywood and realizes the destructive track and insecurities he has built into his ego. Going home again was never so eye opening.  Please watch all three with a clean slate of  mind. I promise you will discover a bit of yourself in each film.",1274227200,,1614,4.479591836734694

Douglas delivers perhaps his best performance as Tripp, an aging writing professor at a small Pittsburg college who's laboring on his endless 2000 plus page, seven years in the making, second novel.  The morning we meet him is the college's big WordFest weekend.  His wife has just left him and his mistress (Frances McDormand), announces she's pregnant.  Oh yes, she's also the chancellor of the school -- and the wife of his boss.

Grady's editor (Robert Downey Jr.), determined to finally read the highly-anticipated new book, is in town with his transvestite date.

Katie Holmes is an ambitious live-in student who is eager to ease Grady's pain.

And then there's James Leer (Tobey Maguire), the eccentric and brilliant writing student who's the fuse that ignites Grady's volatile weekend.

Before long, there's a dead, blind dog, a stolen car, and Marilyn Monroe's jacket thrown into the mix.

Director Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) and screenwriter Steve Kloves (adapting from Michael Chabon's acclaimed novel) delivered a consistently surprising, droll, heartfelt and often hilarious film experience that's worth revisiting.

Douglas is a prize-winning author turned professor and Maguire his best student, but a total weirdo. Holmes is another student who boards at Douglas's home and is sweet on him. Downey is the professor's long-suffering publisher who wants to get in Maguire's pants. School dean McDormand is cheating on husband Thomas with Douglas, who is a member of Thomas's English dept.

1266281,3,B00003CXDJ,"The year 2000 saw the release of The Wonder Boys, a tale of a washed-up, one-hit wonder novelist who ends up in a university teaching writing. Michael Douglas plays Grady Tripp, a guy who smokes pot to get through his day, and meeting up with his gay publisher.

As the movie progresses, marching out these cast of characters, I was struck by the chemistry of the actors. Katie Holmes, an aspiring writer herself, wants more than a student/teacher conference, but the script does not play her up well. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) plays the gay publisher, who has not had a hit ever since Grady's successful novel, though it's been seven years.

No, the focus is on Tobey Mcguire's (Spider-man) character, James Leer, who is a chronic liar, runs away from his rich parents and his only saving grace is his writing. James shoots a blind dog and steals a Marilyn Monroe jacket for kicks and Grady tries to get him through it.

Surviving the weekend, Grady makes some choices in his life including giving an angst-ridden writer (who has many problems) a chance at a novel.

I was intrigued by the chemistry and the writing really helped this film, although slow at times and a bit tiresome as the plot plods along. Grady wants the chancellor, played by Frances McDormand (Fargo). I don't get what he sees in this plain, stoic woman who can't make up her mind about Grady and frankly treats him like crap.

He suffers a series of life crises over the course of one long weekend, as well as coping with several outside crises that seem to fall into his lap.  These include his wife leaving him; his girlfriend announcing she's pregnant; his pretty grad student hitting on him; his NYC book editor turning up to see his seven-years-in-the-making next novel; and a possibly-suicidal student who has written a novel of his own--could he be the next ""wonder boy?""  Also involved in the entertaining plot are a blind dog named Po; a waitress named Oola; and a fur-collared jacket worn by Marilyn Monroe when she married Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.  The weekend's events shake Grady loose from his pot-fueled apathy and compel him to finally decide what it is he wants for the next stage of his life.
I missed this film when it was in the theaters.  I am not a huge Michael Douglas fan, but this is a fine performance, one where he actually inhabits the character and ""makes him real.""  He is marvelously supported by Tobey McGuire as James, a celebrity-death-obsessed writing student; Frances McDormand as the wife of the English Department chancellor (and Grady's pregnant girlfriend); and Robert Downey Jr. as Grady's on-the-prowl book editor in another of Downey's small-but-perfectly-nuanced, completely real performances.

The humor in the film is subtle, but there are several guffaws to be had. The film follows a college English professor played by Michael Douglas during the weekend of Wordfest, a literary celebration that brings out a best-selling author (Rip Torn) whose prolific success only makes Douglas, who wrote one best-seller seven years earlier, feel like a failure. His marriage is on the rocks, he's having an affair with a colleague's wife (Frances McDormand), battling with his publisher (Robert Downey, Jr), and trying to comprehend the eccentricity of one of his most gifted pupils (Toby McGuire).

This is the kind of movie that should appeal to anyone who majored in English in college and delighted in mocking the pompous pinheads so often found in advanced literature courses. They are abundantly portrayed here.

Michael Douglas, as professor Tripp is not in charge of his life anymore, but barely flows along with whatever happens.

One of the best movies about writers and writing I've seen, ""Wonder Boys"" is centered around Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas in one of his most enjoyable performances), the college professor and the author of one very good book who has written over 2000 pages of his eagerly expected (at least by his impatient editor, Robert Downy, Jr - where is this guy?) second book but still is not sure when and how it ends. During one strange weekend, Grady would have to deal with his wife leaving him, his married girlfriend's pregnancy, the stolen Marylyn Monroe's priced jacket, a dead dog in his car's trunk, his obviously very talented but troubled student, and the most serious question of all - to write or not to write? ...Oh, and there is also that song by Bob Dylan!",1177027200,2,900,4.521472392638037

1266597,4,B00003CXDJ,"Wonder Boys (Curtis Hanson, 2000)

I ended up seeing a lot of movies-- a whole lot of movie-- the weekend I saw Wonder Boys, and it was by far the best of them. Rare is the movie, these days, that's laugh-out-loud funny. Rarer still is that movie actually a drama, a sort of absurdist metatragedy about the decline and fall of a University professor who seems bound and determined to destroy his life and his career in the shortest possible time.

Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is that professor, a man who wrote one vastly popular, critically acclaimed book seven years before, and has been unable to finish its follow-up. On the weekend of a big to-do at the school where he teaches, his editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.), comes into town to get a look at this legendary manuscript Tripp has spent the last seven years writing. At the same time, James Leer (Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire), a neurotic student, has just finished his own manuscript; his relationship with Sara Gaskell (Frances MacDormand), the University chancellor's wife, is going through a rough patch; and his boarder, Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), has picked the worst of all possible times to turn up the pressure on him to get involved romantically with her. Everything's lined up for either salvation or damnation, or possibly both, and Tripp seems bound and determined to figure out as many ways as possible to stick his fat in the fire while still leaving himself that one last road. As we all know, however, the road to hell is paved with good intentions...

When Curtis Hanson is on his game, he's one of the best in the business, and he's definitely on his game here. It helps that he pulled in a fantastic stable of actors to realize Steven Kloves' fabulous script, from the justly famous Michael Chabon novel of the same name. This is a fun, fun movie that got far too little exposure during its brief theatrical run; rediscover it now. ****",1167782400,6,1929,4.7351190476190474

1266599,5,B00003CXDJ,"WONDER BOYS is a story about making choices.  It is about moving forward in your life and accepting yourself in a new role.  The main character is Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas).  Tripp is an excellent name for this character because throughout the movie, he experiences a series of falls, making it necessary for him to change his life.  Tripp is a writer who had one successful novel but can't finish his second novel.  This writer's block is symbolic of Tripp's inability, in essence, to take an active role in the transformation his own life.  Douglas's performance of Tripp is masterful:  sensitive, outrageous, and funny.

James Leer (Tobey Maguire)is a younger version of Tripp.  James has just finished his first novel, and in James, Tripp sees vestiges of his former self.  Tripp, however, has lost his real reason for writing and has become jaded with writing and love.  Leer is the perfect name for this character, since he ""sees"" into Tripp's soul and understands that the great man has become lost.  Maguire's performace is as strong as Douglas's and in the same ways.  At once we feel a fascination with James Leer, a great curiosity and also sympathy.  James has talent but few people encourage him:  this is why Tripp is so important to James.  Tripp is the ""best"" teacher James has ever had because Tripp recognizes and tries to cultivate James's talent.  At the same time, Tripp plays a fatherly role for James, initiating him into a larger, adult, world.

Pittsburgh provides the perfect setting for characters who are trying to move from one shore to another in their lives.  The characters continually cross one of the many bridges in that city, which is as beautiful in its hope as it is terrible with grit and despair.

A series of events brings Grady Tripp to a point where he must make a choice about his life.  Just as Pittsburgh is the place where three rivers meet (and thus is a place of magic and mystery, a sacred place), Grady Tripp is torn between three woman:  the wife who has left him (who comes from an Ozzy and Harriet-type home); the young temptress (Katie Holmes) who is much like the women Tripp always ""falls"" for; and his mistress (Frances McDormand) who is more Tripp's age and who is his intellectual equal, if not his superior.

A fun movie, packed with great sight gags, sensitive portrayals of characters, sophisticated choices by the director about setting and music, and witty dialogue.  The DVD also offers the Dylan music video, ""Things Have Changed"" as a special feature.",1167091200,5,2523,4.773672055427252

1266601,3,B00003CXDJ,"Wordfest is taking place at the University in Pittsburgh where the resident professor of history is involved in all kinds of shady deals.  His star student has written a novel about the teacher and his foibles and is an expert on the unnatural deaths of movie and television stars.  The English teacher who is host of the yearly meeting has a fur-collared jacket which Marilyn Monroe had worn one time for one of her marriages.  It is confiscated along with a big car by someone pretending to be James Brown at the party.  It was a complicated and acrimonious affair in that awful winter weather, really bad -- rain, sleet, snow on the ground all at the same time.

There near the meeting hall was a large statue of Mary (mother of Jesus) looking down as she holds the babe.  I saw a similar statue at a Methodist church in Nashville of Christ; when you kneel and look up (as I did) you look right into his eyes.  It was eerie and moving all at the same time.  At Sewanee, we had Church Women United sessions with the marvelous peacocks honking at you, but no Jesus statue in existence.  That is near Bell Buckle where the original Webb School is located.

Bob Dylan sand Worried Man and Old Man; Michael Feinstein has a good rendering of the latter on one of his CDs. Two of my favorite actors were the ""wonder boys;"" I love Tobey Maguire, but Robert Downey, Jr. looks like my son, Jeff.  You learn to improvise when writing for any reason.  Nobody teaches a writer anything, but sometimes people need to be rescued.  It means nothing, all of it nothing.  What does it matter what anybody thinks.  Maybe I'm just a little sad tonight.

The young writer who told lies constantly was called a freak, but his story turned into a published book.  The professor typed faster than my electric word-processor typewriter, and that's saying something.  He had worked on his book for seven years, with 2,621 single-spaced pages and still no end in sight, no way to end something he could not remember typing while ""under the influence.""  Katy Holmes is in this flick and learned first hand what can happen when even someone as young (looks about sixteen) as she gets involved and finds herself in trouble after being under the influence.  She is yet to be repented officially.

The same kind of trouble the English teacher's wife is with the writing professor who feels that he lost everything he thought was important; now, however, he has someone to help him to get there -- in fact, two someones.  He knew where he wanted to go but not how to get there.  Good night, sweet prince.",1160179200,,2574,4.535791757049892
1266602,5,B00003CXDJ,"Let's face it:  Writers are oddball, quirky, mega-eccentric creatures, yet this delightful comedy takes writers--and writing--to a whole new dysfunctional dimension.  WONDER BOYS tells the story of how a handful of extremely interesting characters must suddenly make some very formidable decisions--all over the course of one breathless weekend.

Michael Douglas carries this movie most admirably as laid-back, pot-smoking Professor Grady Tripp.  Even being tenured can't take away from the fact his third wife has left him, he's knocked up the college chancellor (Frances McDormand is admirable, too), he's stolen a car (and a priceless Marilyn Monroe collectible), hidden his star pupil from the authorities, and is desperately trying to keep his crazed editor away from his second novel--a novel he can't, after more than 2600 pages, find a way to finish.  Intriguing developments, to be sure, but beyond all the madness and mayhem Professor Tripp finally finds himself at a crossroads; he's never had to make tough decisions before, but as the weekend ends, some serious life-changing choices come a'calling.

This is a cast that works together magnificently.  Tobey MaGuire as troubled, brooding student James Leer is so deadpan I didn't know whether to offer him a helping hand. . .or run for my life.  Robert Downey Jr., as impassioned, zany editor Crabtree, essentially plays himself.  And young Katie Holmes is irresistibly snuggable.  But the real star of this film is screenwriter Steve Kloves; after all, if you're going to have a story about writers, and writing, you'd best have a script that makes all the characters, despite all that's happening to them, compelling and believable.  And Kloves sure pulls it off, in spades.

WONDER BOYS, set in blustery, damp, rainy Pittsburgh, is great fun.  It's darn time a movie about writers was funny, instead of dark and morbid.  After all, writers are a barrel of laughs; I've got a two thousand-page novel to prove it.

I had to wait a long time for it to be released to DVD (it was in theaters in late winter but they didn't put it to DVD till almost a year later...probably hoping to capitalize on awards' season reviews and recommendations).  It was well worth the wait.

It is a shame that this film was overlooked with the awards.  I think that the timing of the release factored in but maybe it just appeals to some people (like me) more than others.  The entire ensemble does a great job.

I just rewatched it and I still enjoy it after at least 6 viewings.  It would make a wonderful addition to your video collection, especially if you are a Michael Douglas fan.  (And having a Pittsburgh connection helps too...the movie really captured a lot of the essence of Pittsburgh even with the weather when there is snow on the ground, the sun is peeking through and it is raining all at the same time!).  It is just a good movie all around and should appeal to viewers who enjoy smart films.

There are just truly funny scenes and some really touching parts.  What a wild journey these characters find themselves on over the span of just one weekend.  I think the best part is that it isn't non stop action and things don't get so out of the realm of possibility.  It still retains a good touch of believability, even as some pretty unbelievable things happen.

1266605,5,B00003CXDJ,"I am a native Pittsburgher and have known professors of creative writing at the Universities there, and let me tell you that the makers of ""Wonder Boys"" have captured the real McCoy here perfectly!

This is the absolute best performance of Michael Douglas's career in my opinion. He captures the inner-essence of over-the-hill (but in denial about it) Grady Tripp and lets us, the viewer, really crawl around in this character's skin like few other movies I've ever watched, particularly for a comedy film. As I watched this movie, I didn't see Michael Douglas playing a role. Rather, I was watching Grady Tripp and I was involved in his life.

This isn't your typical Hollywood movie, nor it is a formulaic comedy either. There are few artificial sets here. The locales are real - I know, I live there. The houses are real, the interiors are real Pittsburgh-style homes, the dreary, slushy rain pouding down on snow-covered lawns is 100% Pittsburgh climate. The bars are truly that dingy and smoky; the streets that narrow and claustrophobic; the skies that gray and overcast.

I love that this smart little comedy shows a sophisticated side to the overall Proletariat, working-class city. It's true: Pittsburgh has a very prestigious and vibrant cultural vibe and there are very many truly unique and colorful characters living there, much like Grady Tripp. From my personal experiences, I would have to attest that writer Michael Chabon really is from Pittsburgh or he could have never written such truly genuine Pittsburgh-esque characters. Even though the actors aren't, they sure feel like Pittsburghers to me.

There are all kinds of comedies out there. Some smart and others stupid. Smart comedies tend to try a little too hard in my opinion to be smart and end up coming off as smug or arrogant. Woody Allen's comedy films sometimes come off this way. But Wonder Boys walks this fine line carefully and never talks down to the audience. These characters aren't showing off, and the brilliantly subtle screenplay seems so naturalistic that at times you simply forget that you're watching a movie at all.

I wish there were many more comedy films being made these days of this level of quality, originality, and intelligence. Sadly, Wonder Boys is a rarity. I cherish it nonetheless and applaud it for walking such a narrow path of perfection.

Take it from an educated Pittsburgher - Wonder Boys is the real thing! I loved this movie and can't sing its praises high enough. I think you will too.",1139356800,4,2503,4.905437352245863

1266711,5,B00003CXDJ,"Back during my late high school years, my father bought the ""Wonder Boys"" soundtrack. Hearing Bob Dylan's powerful and poetic masterpiece ""Things Have Changed"" was something that captivated me. Even though I hadn't seen the movie yet, Dylan's lyrics were nothing short of brilliant and just downright truthful. Sort of a bluesy feeling and self-loathing track, but done in a humorous way. At least, that's what I think of the track. Hearing this track got me wanting to watch the movie for myself.

Upon first viewing, the words that come up at the beginning of the movie kinda bugged me, telling the viewer that this movie was modified and edited. I panicked, but hearing Michael Douglas' character, Professor Grady Tripp, say the ""f"" word got me relieved... although I wonder why that ""disclaimer"" is even shown at the beginning of the film...?

The movie was nothing like I expected it to be. I expected an emotional drama that a simple-minded high school student won't understand. It's a movie that centers around Professor Grady Tripp. He's had it rough lately. His girlfriend leaves him, his other lover Sara (played by the wonderful Frances McDormand) is pregnant and contemplates on whether to have an abortion or not, one of his college students, James Leer (played by Tobey Maguire in probably his best role to date) is a moody person that Tripp doesn't understand, nosey editor Terry Crabtree (played hilariously by Robert Downey, Jr.) is hounding Tripp about his unfinished novel, which Tripp can't finish because he suffers from writer's block and ultimately wrote a 2000+ page epic that just goes on and on... and to make matters worse, Tripp has been experiencing blackouts and resorts to drugs to ease down.

This may look like some typical drama, but the most surprising thing about this movie is the fact that it's funny. I mean, it's just downright hilarious. So many odd things pop up, which only adds to Tripp's problems. His editor is going out with a *ahem* transvestite. His student, James Leer, shot a dog that belong to Tripp's lady friend Sara's husband, who happens to be Tripp's boss. I mean... this is one wacky movie. It's what some people categorize as a ""dark comedy,"" ""black comedy, ""comedy/drama,"" or like how I categorize it: a ""dramedy.""

Even with its numerous humorous (heh... I made a funny!) scenes, the movie is also very touching. Despite Tripp's problems, he still manages to be a good teacher, as well as mentor, to James Leer. He wants to be a good husband to Sara (even if she's already married to his boss). And most of all, Tripp wants to finish his damn book so he could get Crabtree off his back.

""Wonder Boys"" is truly one of the best movies of recent times. Wackiness ensues, but don't think of this as some slap-stick comedy. Think of it as more intelligent and witty humor. And there's the story of a teacher and a student that discover that there's pleasure and happiness in life. A severely underrated masterpiece and it ranks in my top ten favorite films of all-time. It was released in the year 2000, which I call the year of bad, awful, and lame movies. ""Wonder Boys"" isn't one of them.

 Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control.

Good luck finding roles into which Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr., slip into as effortlessly and brilliantly as they do the ones in this film. With a script that neatly repackages Michael Chabon's excellent novel for the screen, Steve Kloves (lately the screenwriter for the Harry Potter series) shows where he mastered the craft of adaptation. And director Curtis Hanson follows up the tour-de-force of L.A. Confidential with this funnier, more bizarre, and ultimately more enjoyable effort.
On one level, the movie plays out like a drug-induced dream sequence; it's almost implausible that so much would happen during a single weekend. Michael Douglas loses his wife, discovers his girlfriend (McDormand) is pregnant, flees the university at which he and his girlfriend work with his darkest and most troubled student after that student kills his girlfriend's husband's dog and steals Marilyn Monroe's wedding coat, exposes that student to pot and his literary agent of ambiguous sexuality, has his car stolen, loses a 2,000 page manuscript...
Did I mention that his girlfriend is the chancellor and her husband is the chair of the department that employs Douglas?
Yet all these events--and many more--feel very real during the movie. And not in the dreamlike way that anything makes sense while you're sleeping: this movie has the feel of truth. Other reviewers have complained that it's too weird, that each character's eccentricities pile on those of the others until it passes a level of acceptability. But people have quirks; some people are pathological liars, some people just like one kind of shoe, some people can only write in a pink bathrobe. In life we take these quirks for granted in the people we know and love; in Wonder Boys a group of people are thrown together, quirks and all, by fate and common interest and the confines of a very realistic university life. The interplay of their quirks, and the way that people who come to them with sympathetic eyes quickly rally to support one another, makes for a movie that engages, entertains, and provokes thought. If that's not what you look for in a movie, look elsewhere. If it is, prepare to add a new movie to your all-time favorites list.",1087776000,2,2353,4.989821882951654

But I believe those who ascribe such notions to the movie have clearly missed the plot's subtle nuances, and the humorous undercurrent that permeates the entire theme.
Wonder Boys has that charming yet simple elegance that draws on its real but clumsy characters -- all pretty painstakingly drawn out as we almost live their fumbling lives. Professor Tripp (Douglas) in particular was very credible as just about anyone among us. James Leer's (McGuire) obsession with celebrity suicides is made light of and overcast by his pathological lying. Holmes is appropriately cast to tantalize.
Plus, the score is something to cherish thanks in no small measure to Bob Dylan's superb ""Things have changed"".
A good chuckle comedy with a wistful look at midlife, decisions to be made or avoided. Recommended for the discerning viewer.",1087344000,18,943,5.2105263157894735
1266834,3,B00003CXDJ,"Director Curtis Hanson adapts Michael Chabon`s acclaimed book and delivers a gripping dramedy about the writing process and life choices. Michael Douglas plays Grady Tripp, a famous writer and teacher that faces some weird and unusual situations during a contrived weekend. Grady tries to help James (played by the excellent Tobey Maguire), a confused yet brilliant student who is feeling unsure about his life and its future options. Together, the two ""wonder boys"" will come clean with themselves and redefine their main goals and priorities. But, before they reach that scenario, a couple of offbeat adventures unfold.
Curtis Hanson (""LA Confidential"", ""8 Mile"") provides an edgy and hip movie, presenting a true-to-life (in a way) and witty plot, well-crafted characters, superb acting, stunning cinematography and an adequate score. Although this picture is a bit overrated, it still deserves some praise as it delivers a captivating and absorbing cinematic experience. However, sometimes it`s way too clever for its own good, and the story is hardly groundbreaking material. The ending is not the best, either.
Still, ""Wonder Boys"" works fine as an edgy Hollywood effort, expertly mixing alternative and mainstream elements to create an intelligent and entertaining piece of filmaking, courtesy of Curtis Hanson`s ecclectism (an underrated director, by the way).

The problem with most films about supposedly great writers, is that the writing can't stand up to the hype. Finally, a film with writing that makes you believe the characters may be as talented as everyone thinks they are. Maybe you have to be a writer, or at least have read a few books, to appreciate this film, which is, after all, about writing: it's pain, anxieties, frustrations, insecurities, impotencies, and ultimately, exhiliration. The characters are well-developed, and universally well-acted. Unpredictable and funny, only marred by a Hollywood ending that grossly cops out. Wonder Boys is a unique film, not for your average movie goer who loved Armageddon, but for those who actually enjoy thinking about what the heck they're doing with their lives. Great ensemble cast; perhaps the smartest movie of 2000.",1082592000,5,1043,5.251497005988024
1266836,5,B00003CXDJ,"It pretty much all takes over a long weekend of debauchery of one form or another. Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a laboring novelist and teacher at a college in Pittsburgh, author Chabon's favorite place to write about (witness: The Mysteries of Pittsburgh). He's working on this novel-in-progress, swearing to his agent (with a transvestite date in tow when he swoops into town for an award banquet) that it's nearly finished when, in reality, it's anything but. He's got a bazillion pages, but the book just isn't going anywhere, certainly not toward any planned or near-at-hand conclusion.
Tripp also has a wife who announces she's leaving him and a mistress (chancellor of the school, as well as the wife of Grady's boss) who tells him she's pregnant. Add to the mix a sexy student who shacks up at Grady's house and the wonderful, brilliant, and horribly confused student played by Tobey Maguire - whose best scene, according to my 19yo son is when, in a marijuana fog, he gets the munchies, lifts the lid of a candy jar, and utters an unforgettable warble of unmitigated joy when he discovers lemon drops.

I am a Michael Douglas fan, and I believe that this is his best role. I could not imagine anyone else playing Grady Tripp; same goes for Tobey Maguire as James Leer. Robert Downey, Jr. IS Crabtree.
Much of the humor is subtle and not overly obvious, not is it humorous to the characters in the situation.
This is one of the types of films that has it all: great characters, great story, great acting, great cinematography, great directing, and great music (which, by the way, fits in perfectly with each scene-- look at the scenes specifically with the Neil Young and Leonard Cohen songs).
This is definitely one of the best films that's come out of the past decade, and I'm sure it'll remain a favorite for years.",1078185600,4,859,4.548387096774194
1266838,5,B00003CXDJ,"Finally had a chance to see this movie on DVD and my only regret is that I didn't get the opportunity to see it sooner.  No, wait, I have a second regret - that I didn't have time to watch it again immediately after the first look.
This is a movie the viewer watches in awe for a number of reasons:  Awesome story: What's going to happen next and why doesn't it phase Grady Tripp in the least despite the fact that it's likely to be bad and he can't possibly anticipate it?  Awsome direction:  how does Hanson seemlessly weave all these apparently diverse characters into a continous story line?  Awesome emotions:  Just when the audience is looking for a sad note, the cast, writer and director find a way to get a laugh.
This film is not funny in the spirit of the Marx Brothers, What's Up Doc? or Animal House.  The laughs come unexpectedly and from left field and quickly move the viewer into the next scene before he/she realizes it.
Micheal Douglas is superb as Grady Tripp, professor and one time (trying to become at least two time) author, whose life is in a shambles.  Despite the insanity in Tripp's life, Douglas lets Tripp just roll with it.  Toby Maguire portrays the strangely interesting character James Leer who is overly interested in suicide and a budding author himself.  McDormand shines as Tripp's true love as the chancellor of the university where Tripp teaches.  Robert Downey is absolutely whacky as Tripp's editor whose life is hitting the rocks in its own way.  Katie Holmes is excellent as Tripp's tenant who just might want to do more than sleep in his house.
Despite the crazy weekend Tripp is living through there is little happening to the characters that doesn't fit or seems out of place.  At the end, the viewer is treated to Bob Dylan's rockin' theme ""Things Have Changed.""
In the background, the film is almost a guide to writing a novel or story.  The things that are happening to Grady screams, ""this is your novel...this is how to do it!""  If only he would take a moment to see it.

1266839,5,B00003CXDJ,"First of all it is an extremely funny film with plenty of grotesque and incredible situations that are decently exploited to create some lurid situations and narrative. The perambulating dead dog is by far the best element, though the perambulating Marylin Monroe wedding coat is just as funny, though with a little bit more gusto and human depth. But it is also a picture of what writers are, how they become writers, where they find their imagination and inspiration, how they work on it to produce some work of art or work of fiction, how they live in their everyday life and in their professional life, how they do odd jobs, even university professor, to survive in-between books or plainly income waves. You add to that several sexual situations that are by far funny both ah-ah and strange and you have a hectic picture of what an ordeal such a life is : you lose your wife, you steal the wife of your boss, you kill his dog, you steal his precious property, you have to cope with transvestites and other gay or non-gay nymphomaniac both male and female people, you have to feed boys from rich families who rough it in a bus station in order to do what they want, to be independent and to realize what is a dream, you have to have your boss's book published, though it is austere s**t, in order to get your new book through and the book of your genius student put on the market, you have to lie to cops, to steal a car without knowing your are stealing it, you have to make your boss's wife pregnant just because cheating him is what makes you go on in a blind alley and forget that it is a blind alley, etc, etc. To be a writer in today's world is just a permanent ordeal in which you have to do everything unethical, everything farfetched and havoc-like just to have the fun and the thrills you need to fill up an empty page with some mental vomit that might eventually become golden plated and a best seller, which does not prove much anyway, except that you will be able to get some dough out of it and that will prevent you from going on with your surviving drudgery and slavery. It is better to be the slave of a publisher than the slave of a university when you do have some imaginative gem in your gut, is it or isn't it ?

""How do you figure?"" responds Prof. Tripp.
""I can see the outlining of his butt.""
This is one scene that makes ""Wonder Boys"" least expected to be a comedy.  It has many other humorous lines in scenes the audience least expects.  The movie writer brilliantly fit these sequences to the dramatic side of it.  The combination keeps the certain issues serious.  Few other movies have a such unique theme.
Michael Douglas wonderfully performs the part of Prof. Tripp, a selfish writer who hasn't released his follow-up in seven years.  His mistress, plays by Frances McDormand, reveals she's pregnant.  He travels to his soon-to-be ex-wife with his troubled student James Leer, the underrated role played by Tobey McGuire.  Leer is seduced by book editor Terry Crabtree, humorously played by Robert Downey Jr.  This combination of actors give ""Wonder Boys"" the added necessary humorous and dramatic touches.  Their chemistry amongst one another is present in ever scene.  Every actor was dissed in the 2000 Oscar ceremonies.
Bob Dylan's Oscar winning theme song ""Things Have Changed"" is perfect for the beginning and end credits.  His musical poetry fits the theme of the movie perfectly.  It gives an added influence, especially to aspiring writers.  The folk song expresses the realisms in the characters making them look as average people rather than supermodel look-alikes with a rough life.  More movies need this.
No one will forget ""Wonder Boys"" after having been watched.  One will laugh continuously during and long after the movie.  Everyone will have that favorite scene that will be mimicked repeatingly.",1060041600,,1678,5.159259259259259
1266843,2,B00003CXDJ,"Yes, this is a funny, ultimately warm-hearted film.  Michael Douglas is a loveablely grumpy professor-writer.  He fumbles through the story in a likeable, yet truly lackluster fashion.  He loses his very young and beautiful wife because ""he's not there.""  He keeps putting off the romantic advances of a very young student/boarder of his, not so much because it would be wrong, but because he apparantly does not have the time or energy to deal with it.
The professor's co-star is a young, very gifted, most insightful, yet possibley suicidal student, whose difficult to figure out because he's a habitual liar.
The professor's boss is having an affair with him, is pregnant by him, is frustrated by his indecisiveness, and yet seems willing to follow his lead--if he'll give it.
Wonderboys speaks well to our need to wake up and live life.  But, it seems to suggest that just making choices is enough--being decisive, regardless of what decision is made, is the key.  Live good, live bad--but live intensively!  Thus, the film does marvelously what I really hate about ""typical Hollywood movies"":  it normalizes, sympathizes, and heralds immorality, by wrapping it up in adorable characters.  The boss's husband supposedly is clueless about the affair, and therefore deserves it?  Does a young female student, obviously in love with her professor, really belong boarding in his house?  Is it right for a homosexual editor to make shameless advances on a boy who is probably psychologically troubled, and who shows no obvious signs of like attraction?  Finally, does adultery really need to be glorified, as it ultimately is in this movie?
Bottom-line:  If Wonder Boys were judged only on humor and acting it might garner 4 points.  However, the patronizing and even approving approach this film takes towards clear moral weakness drags it down to two.  The film might lead to some interesting discussion for adults, but is clearly not appropriate for children.",1059436800,2,1961,5.103448275862069
1266942,5,B00003CXDJ,"Curtis Hanson followed his excellent L.A. CONFIDENTIAL with another difficult-to-mount literary adaptation, WONDER BOYS. This film, starring an excellent, shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated Michael Douglas, is based upon Michael Chabon's second novel. Douglas stars as Grady Tripp, a washed-up, perpetually-stoned author and college professor.
As the movie opens, Tripp's wife has left him. His girlfriend (who is also his boss' wife) is pregnant, and his oversexed agent is coming to town to see the novel Tripp's not yet finished, though it's over 1,000 pages at this point. Tripp's best writing student is a suicidal depressive, and another of his students, who rents a room in his house, wants to seduce him. Throw into that mix a transvestite with a tuba, a pregnant waitress named Oola, a possibly-stolen car and a dead dog that one of the characters accidentally shot. From that comes the loopy, brilliant plot of this movie.
Though some might find Tripp's weekend a bit implausible, people who realize that some writers work best when they're in the middle of real-life chaos will embrace this insightful, well-written film.
It's funny and touching. Tobey Maguire makes a great impression here as the impressionable, odd and suicidal student writer James Leer. Katie Holmes carves a terrific niche for herself in one of the film's smaller significant roles. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly terrific as the agent who understands his client's idiosynchracies a bit too well, and Frances McDormand manages to make her long-suffering character sweet and lovable.
This is a great movie, particularly if you've ever thought of yourself as something of a writer.",1051056000,3,1659,5.360153256704981

1266944,5,B00003CXDJ,"Many creative people strive for perfection, especially in their first true work. Amongst other things, ""Wonderboys"" explores what might happen if perfection was actually achieved. Professor Grady Tripp, (Michael Douglas), is a lecturer in Creative Writing whose first novel was a critical success. That was seven years ago and he is still working on his follow-up work. Many of his students admire him, he smokes a lot of dope, is having an affair with  his boss's wife and occasionally becomes unconscious for no apparent reason. He is a man without ambition, coasting through life. Mildly jealous of those who still show a passion for life, he becomes entangled in the world of one of his students, James Leer (Toby Maguire), who manages to show even less passion for existence than the professor.
James is recognised by his peers as being both weird, in an introverted semi-postal way, and yet more talented than the rest of them put together. Their half-hearted attempts to pull him down to their level are ignored, leaving James mired in his own depressing view of reality. It's even possible that he has chosen Professor Tripp as his mentor; somehow hoping that someone, almost as disconnected from reality as himself and yet capable of publishing a seminal work, might be able to show James a way through the maze. In a way, this is exactly what happens, but not in any sort of linear fashion. While the film largely follows the professor's point of view, James is often the one our sympathies are drawn to. He lies constantly, in such a creative and self-consistent way, that no one truly knows what is going on in his life. It's as if he is testing plot lines on an unsuspecting audience in an effort to hone his story-telling skills.
Despite concentrating on these two  characters, the film is an ensemble piece, chock full of minor but lovingly crafted people that, for the most part, we'd love to get to know better. Tripp's Editor, Terry Crabtree, (Robert Downey Jr.), is an unsuccessful man who has little confidence but an irrepressible energy; seemingly determined to dance until someone shuts off the stage lights. Tripp's student boarder, Hannah Green, (Katie Holmes), is one of the saner characters in the film. She feels a natural admiration for her teacher; a feeling which she tries to promote into a more adult relationship following the off-screen departure of his young wife. How any flesh and blood man could reject Hannah's scantily clad advances is beyond my understanding, nevertheless that's exactly what Grady does.
The dean of the college, Sara Gaskell, (Francis  McDormand), who is also Professor Tripp's girl friend, is married to the Dean of English, Walter Gaskell, (Richard Thomas), a clueless boor who obsesses over Marilyn Munroe and Joe DiMaggio. Sara truly loves Tripp and yet sees him for the rudderless ship he is. She is very centered, confident and assertive; firmly placing the emotional ball in Tripp's court. He must decide what he wants or loose the only thing he still seems to enjoy in his post novel depression. As you might imagine, when all of these interesting people are thrown into the mix; along with a murdered dog, stolen memorabilia, an enormous novel that can't find an ending and a determined ex-jockey car thief possibly named Vernon; nobody can predict the result. The only certainty is that it will make for an interesting ride. As Director Chris Hanson says, ""All the characters are disparate and yet similar in certain ways. They're all mucking around trying to figure out their lives, just like we are - only they're more amusing along the way.""",1045267200,4,3614,4.921311475409836
1266945,5,B00003CXDJ,"You enjoy the sights and thrill-a-minute ride but when you get off and try to describe the ride to someone else, it's hard to convey the full impact of the event and all the impact that it had on all your senses.  The adventure seeking sense and the intelligence seeking sense as well.
Micheal Douglas.  Wow, I thought I knew ya.  But I had no idea he could be this loose and carefree and actually CONVINCE ME that he could play that role so well.  He really carried the movie with his ""let my hair down"" acting and his voice-overs.  Robert Downey Jr?  Previously, his smarmy acting has always annoyed me.  But I LIKED his smarmy acting in this movie.  That's what his role called for and he was perfect for the character he portrayed.  The other actors were good too but these two really shined.
There's a small but revealing moment in this movie.  When Micheal Douglas and Toby McGuire are talking, a black and white movie is playing in the background.  It's the Picture of Dorian Gray.  The part of the movie we hear is ...""There's no such thing as a good influence.  All influence is immoral.  Why?  Because the aim of life is self-development.  To realize one's nature perfectly.  That's why we're here for.  A man should live out his life fully and completely.  Give form to every feeling.  Reality to every dream...There's only one way to get rid of temptation and that's to yield to it.  Resist it?  So goes sick with longing for the things for which it has forbidden itself.""
That is what this movie is about.  Micheal Douglas denies himself nothing and gives form to every feeling and we get to enjoy the ride with him.  Watching him digging for drugs in someone's personal belongings and him swallowing said drug without even trying to figure out what it is.  And we get to watch him longing for the one thing that he wants.  The one thing which is forbidden to him.  The Chancellor's wife.  While Micheal Douglas the writer English professor is watching her with longing from afar, his voice-over says (and this is my very favorite part as I am a voracious reader myself) ""She was a junkie for the printed word and lucky for me, I manufactured her drug of choice.  She loved to read.  She read everything.  Every spare moment.""
This movie is pure seduction for someone like me who loves word play.  Yes, one can enjoy this movie purely for the fun adventures and action and there is plenty to be had from beginning to end.  Heck, the adventures of Vern (or is it Vernon?) and his pregnant and angelic-looking-Marilyn-Monroe-Jacket-wearing-girlfriend is worth the price of the movie itself.  But beware, in the background, there is an intelligent thought and a bigger picture just waiting for you to dig even deeper into.
For every dead dog almost-found escapade, there is Robert Downey Jr. spewing deep thoughts, for every page of the Professor's manuscript that gets tossed to the wind, there is a camera pan at a cover of THE PLAGUE by Albert Camus.
Whereas the Picture of Dorian Gray ends sadly this Wonder of a movie ends happily for all - fitting and appropriate for all the characters involved.  I really enjoyed this movie and all it had to offer.  I am shocked that no one I knew has ever recommended this movie to me.  No wonder they call movies like this Sleeper films.

It's WordFest, the university's annual writing festival, which could not have come at a worse time. All hell has simultaneously broken loose and there's no end in sight. As Grady's tale unfolds director Curtis Hanson takes us on a whiz-bang trip through Pittsburgh that is both a coming of age story for young and old.
Grady tells us his day started with his wife leaving him; no big deal they've done that before. His mistress, university chancellor Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), is pregnant with his child (she also happens to be married to the English dept. head, Grady's boss).These are only the beginning. Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), is in town to try to get a look at Tripp's much overdue novel, which he desperately needs to save both of their careers. To top it off, Grady's  student Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), who is renting a room in his home, has the hots for him, there's a dead dog in his trunk, a stolen Marilyn Monroe jacket in his car, a James Brown want-to-be after Grady's car, and then there's James Leer.
Leer (Tobey McGuire), a student of Tripp's, is a noticeably strange and talented young writer who idolizes Grady. Tripp won't let James waste his obvious talent and, even with all the things going on in his life, takes James under his wing, if just for a day. Their trip together finally allows them understand each other, what they've been through, who they are, and most importantly where they want to go and how to get there.
Michael Douglas is absolutely fabulous as Grady Tripp, which one hopes leads him to taking on more roles like this where he plays a character of his actual age. McDormand is equally up to the task as the hard edged with soft inside Sara who pairs with Douglas well and we have no trouble believing they would be a compatible couple. Tobey McGuire plays his usual lost young adult role, which he does well. The individual that really impressed me was Robert Downey Jr. who plays his character with a a natural warmth and grace that allows us to embrace his unorthodox character.
Curtis Hanson couldn't have picked a better follow-up to the critically acclaimed LA Confidential. Where that film was cold and tense, this one is warm and freewheeling (even with all the dark humor floating throughout). He certainly knows how to get the most out of his actors and stories. This film is able to not be a conventional drama or comedy but is somewhere in between, and carries a sincere emotional core that is inescapable.",1042675200,3,2630,4.704989154013015
1266949,5,B00003CXDJ,"It's sort of a rule of thumb that if you release a movie early in the year, no matter how good it may be, its forgotten by Oscar time. Such was the case with ""Wonder Boys,"" a phenomenal film that came out in February of 2000. THough the studio wisely re-released it much later in the year, it failed to gain any further momentum. This is a pity, because ""Wonder Boys"" is one of the most well-written, offbeat, and clever films to come out in a long, long time.
Michael Douglas gives what is undoubtedly the performance of his career. As Grady Tripp, a middle-aged author/college professor who is having what is seemingly the weekend from hell, Douglas is convincing and touching.  As his eccentric, troubled student, Tobey Maguire is fantastic. The two of them are aided by a terrific supporting cast, including Frances McDormand, Robert Downey Jr., and Katie Holmes.
Perhaps the real hero of this film, however, is director Curtis Hanson.  Like he did with Los Angeles and the Hollywood Hills in 1997's ""L.A. Confidential"", Hanson perfectly creates a lush, detailed, and oddly enough, nurturing environment for his characters to run amouck in.  There are moments in this film where things seem so vivid and authentic, that you can almost smell or feel the cold air all the characters are breathing.  If Los Angeles was his muse in ""L.A. Confidential,"" suburban Pittsburgh serves that part in this film.
There's a terrific soundtrack to boot, including three Bob Dylan songs (one, written especially for the film won the Oscar), as well as tracks by John Lennon, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen.
""Wonder BOys"" is a rich, finely crafted film that is both funny and touching and gets better with each viewing.",1040256000,3,1704,4.825342465753424
1266950,5,B00003CXDJ,"...I adore this film.  Few directors can capture accurately the essense of a novel; Chris Hanson is among those elite few.
Wonderboys is based from author Michael Chabon's (Mysteries of Pittsburgh, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay) character-driven, interwoven, and heartfelt sophomore effort.  (Oddly enough, the novel was written after Chabon himself was writing a 'perpetual novel' -so he scratched the entire project, and wrote Wonderboys.)  Our heroine (not to be confused with the phonetically identical drug, which was about the only illegal substance not abused by him), Grady Tripp, Pittsburgh creative writing professor, has just been dumped by his beautiful young wife due to his innattention toward her.  Of course, Tripp's estranged spouse was apparently unaware that he was engaged in an affair with the married Chancellor (Frances McDormand) of the English department, whom he finds out that night is carrying his child.
This is only the tip of the iceberg.
James Leer (Toby McGuire) is a macabre junior-level student of Tripp's, who has written a brilliantly truthful novel.  Problem is, however, in order to get close to Tripp, he concocts numerous tall-tales in order to get closer to his venerable professor.  Robert Downey, Jr., a struggling bisexual editor from New York City, appearing in Pittsburgh to check on Tripp's follow-up novel in order to salvage his fledgling career, becomes attached to Leer, seemingly converting him to homosexuality, while, at the same time, he feels that Leer's novel will revive his career.
The story is about dependence, I believe -this seems to be the essense of the novel.  And Hanson subsequently depicted this WONDERfully on film.  Drugs are Tripp's primary dependence in the beginning of the story; but as time persists, he learns that people are his primary solice.  Downey's character depended on Tripp's upcoming novel, and Tripp failed him; McDormand's character depended on Tripp to take responsibility for their child, and he almost does not; McGuire's character depends on Tripp for a number of things, and Tripp ends up getting him inebriated.  Tripp realizes that he must first understand himself in order to fulfill the complicated demands of those who look up to him.  This is the true beauty of the story, and it was marvelously acted and directed.",1039046400,,2331,5.239247311827957

That being said, this whole movie shines. All of the actors are, of course, great - especially Tobey and Frances McDormand - and the plot is...well, just fantastic. Rarely, if ever, have I seen a movie that so subtly changes moods in one scene (from tragic, to funny, to moving...) without you being aware of it, until your tears are replaced by laughter.
 There's not much of extra material on the disc, but that's ok. The stuff there is is interesting, and kept in an offbeat way - exactly like the movie - and I mean this in a good sense!!

1267041,4,B00003CXDJ,"This film did not do great box office business, and it did receive a few reluctant Oscar nods, which is a waste, since it is certainly one of the best films I have seen on the creative process, fate, and life's more complicated decisions.
Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances in years as Grady Tripp, an English professor and published novelist, who has been writing his follow-up for seven years. In the meantime, his latest trophy wife has left him, and he has been having an affair for years with Sara Gaskell, very well-played by Frances McDormand, who happens to be married to the English Department's Dean.
Enter James Leer, a very witty name for the character very well played by Tobey Maguire. James does, indeed, leer from the background. He is Grady's best student, a brilliant writer who seems to craft his work with amazing ease. He is also a compulsive liar, and he drags Grady into a crazy set of circumstances and, eventually, revelations.
Robert Downey, Jr. does a great comedy turn as Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree, who arrives awaiting the novel that Grady simply cannot stop writing. The book has stretched to thousands of pages, and Grady cannot find a conclusion to his novel or to his life.
The direction by Curtis Hanson is understated and superb, and the screenplay, by Steven Kloves adapted from the novel by Michael Chabon, is witty and fast-moving. There are so many good things about this film, and it is a must-see for any frustrated writer. The performances, including a small but memorable part by Rip Torn, are incredibly good, and the chemistry between Douglas and his co-stars McDormand, Maguire and Downey is superb.
I cannot recommend this film enough. There are so many nuances that need to be viewed again and again. It is truly one of the best and most under-rated films out there.",1037491200,6,1835,4.791798107255521
1267042,5,B00003CXDJ,"When I first saw Wonder Boys in the theater back in February of 2000, I gave it an A- (or 4 stars) since I thought the film had a good, low key sense of humor about it but wasn't anything great.  But I've found after multiple viewings that this film has definitely grown on me, maybe because I can relate to the main character, Grady Tripp, and maybe a tid bit with the character of James Leer.  Perhaps it's because I am a writer myself, perhaps I have dabbled in such pharmeceuticals Tripp (pun intended?) brings with him in his car, or perhaps not.
I say also that this is like a Cheech and Chong for intellectuals since it has all the weird, laugh out loud moments of an Up In Smoke or Nice Dreams, yet it has so much more intelligence and detail payed to characters, plus is has some subtle moments thrown in, like they're are on occasion in a C & C opus.  The film is also a great look at the world of writers, how they're judged, and what choices the writer makes in the process.
If you saw this film once, it's the kind of movie to see again, to pick up on things missed on the first viewing, and then if it's enjoyed more, why not another vide?  Favorite scene- Professor Trip, with his just-scene-before dog shooting student James Leer, takes a Codine, gives one to James, which he spits out onto Tripp's jacket, and then go inside a packed assembly where Q is speaking.

The main character is college professor Grady Tripp, played by Michael Douglas. Tripp is also an author who's previous novel was a success nearly seven years ago. Robert Downey Jr. appears as his book editor, waiting for his follow up. Katie Holmes stars as Douglas' most trusted student, who also happens to be renting a room from Tripp. Tobey Maguire, appearing here before the overhyped Spider-Man, is good as the mysterious James Leer. Leer's whole life at the college seems to be based on lies. Leer is from Carvel, Pennsylvania, a town he describes as having ""three motels and a mannequin factory"". Frances McDormand shines as Tripps' boss and mistress. the story has many twists and turns as well as many delightful characters you will enjoy. The movie also features many hilarious moments as well as some great lines. My favorite line in the movie is when Tripp and Leer are in the car and Leer pulls the bag of marijuana from the glove box. Tripp replies, ""Do me a favor, lay off my dope. That stuff's not for amatuers."" Highly recommended for anybody who has not seen it.",1031788800,,1182,4.742718446601942

In the meantime, the professor's star pupil is so engrossed in the fiction piece that he is writing that he has begun to incorporate his fiction with his and the professor's reality.  This makes for quite an interesting adventure between two of the most misunderstood characters on earth:  writers.  These two characters make for fine companions and discover more about each than they bargained for when they try to help each other get untangled from the web of deception they have created.

It features Douglas's least narcissistic (he looks like hell through most of it) and therefore truest performance, which is offset perfectly by Tobey Maguire being his, well, Tobey Maguire-i-est, and the always great-but-loony Robert Downey Jr., very well cast here.  Frances McDormand is as good as she was in ""Almost Famous,"" and I was enchanted by a lovely little cameo by the very-underrated Jane Adams.

Everyone's great here, everything works - from the gorgeous cinematography, right down to the inspired soundtrack.  Douglas, in particular, is masterful as the writer hovering on the edge of personal and professional oblivion.  But it's Steve Kloves' screenplay which really shines.  It's laugh-out-loud funny without needing even one joke, and manages to chart the territory of middle-aged angst and redemption without ever descending into sappiness.

The movie takes place in current time in Pittsburgh, PA. Michael Douglas plays Grady, an aging creative writing professor with one famous novel to his name. Ever since this novel came out, there has been pressure to write something better. Grady has been writing but you get the idea that he will never be done with this new book. Especially since it's over 1000 pages.

1267049,5,B00003CXDJ,"Wonder Boys is one of the quirkiest, funniest and most enjoyable movies around. It is the best movie about campus life I can ever remember seeing because it's about the people who live and work at a college as much as it is about the students. Being quite literate and intelligent, it moves at a pace slower than what some viewers require. I'm not saying it is sluggish. It is a movie about people's actions, or the lack of them, rather than about action itself.
Middle-aged English professor Grady Tripp [Michael Douglas] is a wonder boy, which is the same thing as a one-hit wonder. This is someone who has enormous success with something but is unable to repeat the process. Grady wrote a best-selling and highly acclaimed novel seven years ago and still has not finished his second book. We watch him over the course of a fateful weekend that changes his life and those around him. His wife has just walked out on him. His affair with the head of the college, Sara Gaskell [Frances McDormand], is about to be hit by a big problem. His agent, Terry Crabtree [Robert Downey, Jr.], is coming to town for an important literary festival and will naturally ask about the book. Hannah Green [Katie Holmes], a student who rents a room from Grady, has fallen in love with him. And, for better or worse, another student. the strange and brilliant James Leer [Tobey Maguire], turns out to be the catalyst that brings all the weekend's incredible events together. In the end Grady will have finally learned that you can't succeed by just letting life happen. You have to make some choices.
Wonder Boys was a real treat for me. It stars four of my favorite actors. Douglas has always been a competent performer, but in the last few years, he has stretched his range to good effect. This is his best role ever. Maguire, McDormand and Downey are top of the line. Downey is perhaps the best actor of his generation, and Maguire may turn out to be the best of his. McDormand can do no wrong. She simply isn't capable of a bad performance.
Wonder Boys is one of a trio of movies released on DVD within a week of each other. They have much in common. Each was not a boxoffice success, but all of them are among the top five best American films of 2000. Each has acting that is as good as it gets. Each has a message, which it conveys well without forgetting the entertainment factor. Each is blessed with gifted script writing. The others are Almost Famous and The Contender. I hope each one finds the success it deserves in the home entertainment market.",1016323200,5,2540,4.5359477124183005

In addition, his third wife just dumped him; he's now having an affair with his boss's wife, and he becomes mentor to an odd student who is actually a very good writer.  There's also a subplot concerning a dead dog (don't ask; just watch the film and it'll all makes sense).  Paramount picked the wrong time to release this underrated gem of a movie; in 2000, they dumped ""Wonder Boys"" in February, which is typically a month when Hollywood releases its weaker films.  But ""weak"" isn't the word to describe ""Wonder Boys.""  It's an original, thoughtful comedy that doesn't scream for your attention.

Something about the way he portrays his characters is astounding and very convincing. Same goes in this movie. His portrayal of James Leer is hillarious and depressing and sad at the same time. You really feel sorry for him.
Michael Douglas, who I have never liked, makes a surprising performance. He is very funny, and movie in his protral of Tripp. Robert Downey Jr is HILLARIOUS. Nothing more can be said about him. HILLARIOUS. The rest of the cast is great too.

Although most people I know complain about the rythim of this picture, I believe the topic is delicate and involves a great degree of monotony.

Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr and Tobey Maguire would most probably be seen in Box Office movies. I must say that this one does not fit in this category.

Given the unfairness of this reality it makes my heart soar in the rare instance that the terrific movie in no way detracts from a terrific book and that they can be equally good in different ways.

Such is the case with ""Wonder Boys."" Take a perpetually-stoned professor/novelist, his bi-sexual editor, a brilliant, suicidal, pathologically untruthful student (a collector of Hollywood suicide trivia), throw in one transexual, Marilyn Monroe's wedding jacket, and a dead dog and you have all the ingredients for a lost weekend.

Steve Kloves delivers a wonderful screenplay from Michael Chabon's novel, laying the groundwork for Curtis Hanson's impeccable direction and the perfect musical compliment of Bob Dylan. While many novels suffer mightily in their necessary condensation to the screen, Kloves preserves the book's basic plotline and adds scenes of his own invention that are so concise and so wonderful they sent me racing back to the novel to reread phantom passages I must have missed the first time.

When Professor Tripp (Michael Douglas) and his editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.) enter the home of James Leer (Tobey Maguire) to rescue him from his parents, Crabtree discovers James' story-in-progress in the typewriter (remember those?). In the film, James has crafted a thinly-veiled portrait of his professor/mentor that leads to the first of a small string of epiphanies in the film. The window shades are thrown open on Tripp's comic heart of darkness. As wonderful as this scene is, the book offers us a different picture. In the book what we see is Tripp secretly reading from James's new novel, making a spiritual connection with his difficult-to-understand student.

I recognize my own connection to a work when I have difficulty separating my own lust from the fictional reality. In both book and movie I found myself helplessly drawn to Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), the common-sensical/sensual student who comes on to Tripp, not realizing the depth of his problems. I guess I must have identified with Tripp because I kept finding myself rooting for him to give in to her advances, regardless of consequences.

1267267,3,B00003CXDJ,"This is definitely a poor adaptation of whatever novel this film is based on. You don't have to have read the book to know that stuff has been lost in the screenplay adaptation when characters we know nothing about waltz on the stage and make references to events that weren't even mentioned in film. From what I have gathered of the book the film is based on, the novel is about current and has been geniuses in the literary world. The film, on the other hand, is a self-indulging piece about the glamor of writing. There is a famous refrain about aspiring authors not wanting to actually write, but having written. Meaning that most people do not actually want to labor on a manuscript, rather they would like to bask in the money and the glory of having written a bestseller and struck it big.
  The film capitalizes exactly on that. None of the late and future literary greats are actually working or agonizing or failing, instead they play with each others' manuscripts and reap the accolades. I haven't read the book and so I am not sure how accurately the novel treats the subject of writing, but the film is set in an idealized world, where creative writing students are not wasting their lives working on copycat pop cliches that will never be published and an aging pothead of a professor is being chased by a nubile young genius rather than vice versa. In real life, professors tend to push their neuroses and other forms of madness on their students, in this cinematic wonder, the students are as mature as professor and all are equally able to objectively view their creative labors. What merit the book might have had is lost in this film that takes itself way too seriously
to be a comedy that it's meant. The film takes no artistic risks or explores no genuine issues other than making an obligatory bow to political correctness by making a couple of characters gay and giving Eddie Izzard a cameo appearance.
  Perhaps one of the reasons that this film is so horrible is that it is a mainstream Hollywood product trying to represent the avant-garde while making it so innocuous that it won'tg offend anyone. Small irony, that this screenplay, probably written by professional studio screeqriters is a slap in the face to anybody who has ever struggled to write or faced a 100% rejection rate. The portrayal of a man who has everything and suffers from a writers block while churning out a 3000 page novel is a self indulgent fantasy not unlike gangsta rap. There are no real issues facing troubled writers; not economic hardships, not peer pressure, instead we have a comfortable rich boy genius whose only problem is that his stiff upper lip parents don't give him enough love and understanding. The professor, who suppsedly loses everything in the end, loses nothing, gets a girl of his dreams and continues in his fairy tale existance. This is the ultimate of the film's commercialism since the picture was being touted as a film about a mid-life crisis. If the film is about writing, then it hasn't got an ounce of reality in it. The twists and plots and conflicts that make the dramatic tension in this film are so contrived and sophomoric, that you have to wonder if the whole thing wasn't written by a creative writing class as a term project. The issues and conflicts raised by the film are so innocuous, it would have been allowed to be screened in Maoist China. The film's only saving grace that I give it three (!!!) stars is that the actors manage to portray cool and engaging people despite the mediocrity of the script and the ridiculousness of the scenes they have to act out one can only wonder how they kept a straight face.",1000857600,,3658,4.640432098765432

One of the things that I find to be the most important part of a film is its characters, and WONDER BOYS has a wide variety of fascinating people in it. Toby Maguire stars as the almost suicidal and compulsive liar, James Leer. Weve got Michael Douglas as the weed-smoking professor, Grady Tripp. Robert Downey Jr. (whos just a brilliant actor) plays the gay editor, Terry Crabtree, who becomes fascinated with James Leer, and last  but by no means least  theres the two women, Frances McDormand and Katie Holmes, who do their best to tackle a weekend with the wonder boys. But the character that got the most sympathy out of me was not one of the leading roles, it was instead Walter Gaskell (played by Richard Thomas), who during the film, without the fault of his own, ends up with his dog shot and killed, his favourite memorabilia (a Marilyn Monroe jacket) stolen and finally, to top it all of, his wife leaves him: See the film and youll understand.",999734400,2,1260,4.6968325791855206

1267352,2,B00003CXDJ,"""The Wonder Boys"" wants to be a smart movie like ""Good Will Hunting.""  Alas, it commits the cardinal sin of a smart movie in that when you think about it afterward, the implausibilities and inconsistancies of the plot begin to leap out at you.  Though well acted by Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr., and Tobey Maguire, the story itself is fairly pointless.  The first hour in particular, drags by and as a viewer you are not sure where, if anywhere, the movie is going.  In the second hour, the direction becomes more clear, but it is still rather hard to care because the characters are so off-putting.  Maguire's character, as the young eccentric writer, is annoyingly obtuse and never becomes well defined.  Downey's character, the flamboyant gay publisher's representative adds an element of fun, but at the end the movie cheats by having him enact a too tidy resolution that seems impossible given that he cofesses to Douglas earlier that his employer is about to fire him.  And Douglas's character, allegedly an English professor and one time successful novelist, just drifts through the movie until an ending that causes him to make a major change in his life without any kind of cathartic experience to trigger it.  The part about his 2600 page novel is completely unconvincing.
A couple of other minor characters, like Katie Holmes as another of Douglas's students and Rip Torn as a bestselling novelist add exactly nothing to the story.  The biggest problem is that the movie mistakes cleverness for humor and in the end manages to outsmart itself.  For a movie allegedly about fiction writers and their attempts to tell a great story, it remarkably falls well short of doing so.  I also spotted at least one major continuity error as the weather changes from strong rainstorm to perfectly clear in two outdoor scenes meant to be only a few minutes apart.

It's very rare for a Hollywood film these days to be this good. It features uniformly excellent performances from all the actors involved, and they all play fascinating and well-developed characters (all quirky, but still very likable.) That's a miracle in itself for a studio production these days, (I'm pretty surprised that this wasn't more of an Oscar favourite to be honest..) The story is multi-layered, the script is witty and (very subtley) hilarious, even the soundtrack is great! I haven't seen a movie like this (that I couldn't find fault with) in years!
I've since bought this movie on DVD and watched it many times (it's one of those films that you can just watch over-and-over-and-over and not get bored with.) Put simply, this is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone and everyone who appreciates great movie-making.

'Wonder Boys' really makes me wonder who is in charge of okaying a project in the land of Hollywood.
'Wonder Boys' makes me wonder what the percentage the agents of these actors actually receive.
In all honesty, this movie isn't about anything.  There isn't anything about the characters you find out 2 hours after you watched it that you didn't realize after the first five minutes of the film.  A ""brilliant"" student experiments with alcohol and that's about it.
Go to a rocky cliff with a friend who can't hold his/her liquor, get them boozed up and watch the results.  It will be much more entertaining than this production.
After wasting nearly two hours of my life watching this production and pleading to the motion picture gods that something would actually occur (heaven forbid), I was left motionless.
Trust me on this, nothing happens in this movie.  it isn't about anything at all...and that's really disappointing when you consider a man who brought you something as great as 'LA Confidential' was behind this mess.  Please don't forget the outstanding cast as well...

1267357,4,B00003CXDJ,"Wonder Boys is not one of those movies you think is great because of the story, but is in fact an example of great acting and dialogue. While I think the story is interesting, I believe you could almost throw it out and as long as you maintained the cast and the dialogue, I still would have sat and been pleased to have watched. Personally, I am shocked to be writing this because I believe I am one of the greatest critics of Michael Douglas ever. I typically think he is a two bit joke whose been puffed up on Hollywood telling him he's wonderful-and no I am not jealous because he married Catharine Zeta-Jones.
Instead, the chemistry between he and Toby McGuire is incredible. The way the two play off of each other makes you realize that there maybe is a craft to this acting thing after all. In fact, this movie makes me believe that Toby McGuire may become the finest actor of my generation. He rings of a modern day Jimmy Stewart with his subtle good looks and unique delivery. In fact, I think McGuire in Pleasantville was amazing and even his appearance on Saturday Night Live made me believe the show actually was funny. He has a gift and the performance between he and Douglas really demonstrates how vast a gift he has.
The only criticism of the movie is that I feel like it was too caught-up being a writer's story. It felt a bit obsessed with making you feel as if you needed to understand the hierarchy and life of a writer. Newsflash to people who write stories about writers writing books and movies about making movies (especially you Get Shorty & Bowfinger), we don't care how tragic or funny you think your little world is, find your catharsis elsewhere.
In the end, I just feel that perhaps they should have watched a few David Mamet plays and then shot the movie. KISS--Keep it Simple Stupid. The acting is great. The dialogue is great. The story leaves you going, its so close... oh so close.",994723200,,1916,4.461538461538462
1267358,3,B00003CXDJ,"Michael Douglas is Grady Tripp, a moderately famous author who hasn't been able to follow-up the promise of his first novel, ""Arsonist's Daughter"".  Toiling away teaching undergrad writing at an old New England university (actually, it looks pretty much like Penn), he lusts after Sara, (Frances Mcdormand) the wife of a dean.  Though she seems as interested, she suspects Grady of secretly harboring hopes of patching things up with his ex, and she's married anyway, to another dean who spends money buying Hollywood memorabilia on E*Bay.  With no prospects, he endures constant nagging from his agent, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr., in another of those ambiguous roles that he could have written himself) about the prospects for the planned follow-up to ""Arsonist's Daughter"".  Unable to tell Crabtree of his lack of progress, Tripp toils away at the typewriter while smoking pot and churning out pages to a book that has now numbers over 2000 pages.  Tripp's marijuana habit, probably innocuous at one time, now causes blackouts and has otheriwse destroyed his focus and ability to write cogent books of less than 1000 pages.  The story picks up when Grady discovers somebody even more sexually and morally ambiguous than himself and Crabtree put together - one of Tripp's own students. James (Toby Maguire).  Though a seeming failure at writing (Tripp's other writing workshop students unanimously despise James' work which they see as epitomizing Catholic angst, or simply bad), James has already written a novel, as Tripp discovers when taking the dark-minded student under his wing (his writing skills aside, James can also tell you how each Hollywood legend - in alphabetical order - killed themselves).
""Wonderboys"" is actually a lot of fun, but it begins seeping out of your head before it even comes to an end.  Curtis (""LA Confidential"") Hanson's direction offers tons of fun twists, but none of them connect into a story, and, by the time the flick is half-done, you're ready to ignore any new ones.  Working with a script by Steve (""Fabulous Baker Boys"") Kloves, Hanson almost defeats himself.  He creates a sense of time and space - literary lions are gathered at the university for its annual ""Wordfest"", but then relegates the event to a backburner: it's business as usual for the pot-smoking Tripp, with no tension or release promised by the coming event.  James is also a trip, with Grady discovering the student's tortured spirit actually a carefully constructed shell, covering up an existence of comfort.  Nothing explains James' invented character other than his being a compulsive liar with a habit born by a naturally imaginative spirit.  Tripp himself is a bundle of problems but they're mostly inconsistent - he can't openly love Sara, but his hopes for reuniting with his wife make that seem pointless.  He can't finish his book, but it's not clear that he even has the direction to want to finish the book.  He wants to help James out of his created self, but also wants to develop the boy's writing craft.  Grady doesn't so much mull over these conflicts as simply changing his mind.  It's almost like the script is at war with Tripp - between it's own hopes for a coherent story and Grady's lack of ambition, with Grady the winner.  The script tosses in some more twists just so the story should have something to think about besides Grady's aimlessness - a towering transvestite, a dead dog, a stolen sweater worn once by Marilyn Monroe, a borrowed car - maybe stolen - and Rip Torn as a fellow teacher who's been wildly more successful at selling books than Grady.  None of these things get enough attention to make a score, with the script giving more attention to the wordplay between Michael Douglas, Downey Jr., and Maguire than the story.  In one magicla scene, set in a college-town bar, the three characters mull around and play a game for authors, and imagine whole identities and life-stories for the people that populate their surroundings.  It's fun and a sign of the meditation on writing that ""Wonder Boys"" probably wanted to be.  A great weeknight video.",994291200,4,4106,4.954810495626822

1267473,5,B00003CXDJ,"If you want to find a good movie released in the year 2000, find one made on a small budget with little to no advertising.  A movie that will open and close before the ink of the critic's reviews has even dried.  Wonder Boys was the most mature, the least predictable, and the most entertaining grown-up American movie made last year.  The story follows Tenured creative writing Professor Grady Tripp through an outrageous, hectic weekend 7 years after the publication of a highly successful novel.  His young wife has just left him, he is having an affair with his boss's wife, smokes marijuana, has one ultra-gifted, possibly suicidal young man in his class, and has a sultry young student boarding in his home who seems very willing to take the place of his wife.  In addition to this, his agent comes to town wanting to see his long-delayed sophomore novel, his boss's wife just found out she's pregnant, and there's a strange man insisting that Grady Tripp stole his car.
I guess the marketing department, when they looked at this film, had no idea on how to sell it.  It has no special effects.  No really big waves or gladiators.  It doesn't have lots of music video style shots of cars getting stolen or attractive young women in skimpy outfits dancing on a bar.  Instead of all that vacuous eye candy, this movie offers up three dimensional characters with true to life dialogue.
But then again, they managed to promote American Beauty well enough.  And this movie, while also being about a man in a mid-life crisis, is in many ways better.  This was probably the only American made movie that should have been considered for best picture last year.",992390400,6,1658,4.682758620689655
1267474,3,B00003CXDJ,"""Wonder Boys"" purports to take place at a small university in Pittsburgh.  Whatever.  I'd have an easier time believing it took place on Mars, inhabited by a strange sub-species of humanity that has been lobotomized of any sense of sanity.  Every character has a quirk or a twitch, designed to separate their existence from and endear them to the audience.  Grady Tripp can't seem to finish his 2000+-page novel or the baggie of pot stored in his glove compartment (although he tries and tries with both).  Book editor Crabtree is gay, with a penchant for both statuesque drag queens and morbid young authors.  Young author James Leer is brilliant and talented, yet he is prone to roaming the woods at night with an antique cap gun, and has a kleptomaniacal fetish for Marilyn Monroe memorabilia.  It goes on and on like this.  This character is weird.  That one's strange.  Look at this interesting tick!  Admire that fetish, that obsession, that self-destructiveness!  There are no (absolutely none, believe me I looked) characters here normal enough to ground the movie in any kind of sanity.  Even the weather gets in on the action.  One memorable day starts out with a torrential downpour of rain, shifts into a sunny and spring-like afternoon, and degenerates into a snowstorm at night.  I never realized Pennsylvania had such an unstable weather system!
I get the feeling that all this madness was better suited to the printed page than the screen.  I haven't read Michael Chabon's source novel, but I assume he explains why James Leer has a Marilyn fixation (telling me that she's ""lonely"" and hey, so is he, is not enough).  Or why Grady and Crabtree feel justified in rescuing Leer from the horrors of his upper-class parents, and then immediately hand him over to the police.  Or how a small Pittsburgh university can organize an event called ""WordFest"" (!), and draw thousands to an auditorium for a speech by the pompous English department chair (and furthermore, how said small university can boast not one, but two big-time authors on its faculty).  The movie never delved into these issues, and I for one found the whole mess confusing.
That's not to say that I didn't have fun trying to muddle through the confusion.  Mostly, the credit for that should go to the actors.  The cast is populated by a host of my favourites.  Frances McDormand makes me melt everytime she bugs out those fiercely intelligent eyes of hers.  Her character, the university chancellor (as well as the ""other"" woman), could have easily been loathsome.  But she has such warmth and appeal, that by the end you sympathized with her situation fully.  Tobey Maguire does this kind of dead-eyed wounded deer role perfectly.  I bought his character's obsessions, passions, and intelligence without giving it a second thought.  Robert Downey Jr. had what I think was the toughest role, in that he had to bring humanity and likability to his prowling and maniacal book editor, who's eager for another success but unwilling to push his author too much.  And he had the tough job of seducing Maguire's character without looking completely lecherous.  I think he pulled it off.  Rip Torn and Katie Holmes had small and somewhat insubstantial roles.  He did his best in portraying a blustering author blessed with commercial success.  She was little more than wallpaper.  And what to say of Michael Douglas?  I've never really enjoyed the man's work.  He is at his best, though, when he can use his movie-star chin and rich voice to portray men of dignity and power (I enjoyed him most in ""The American President"").  Here he is disheveled and self-destructive, sporting unkempt hair and peculiar glasses.  So, does it work?  In the beginning, no.  But I do admit that by the end, Michael Douglas got lost in there somewhere, and all I saw on the screen was Grady Tripp (the transformation occurred right around the time when his narrative voiceovers stopped; it is a technique used too often unsuccessfully).  So, kudos Mike.
The one thing that director Curtis Hanson did get right was exorcising most examples of the writing the characters produced.  ""Finding Forrester"" fell into this trap.  You can't tell me this writer is gifted, and then read to me examples of his work that border on illiterate.  Here, we get flashes of James Leer's prose, and if you look hard enough you can read a couple of lines from Tripp's novel.  But it's kept to a minimum, thus keeping intact the illusion that these people are all special talents.
In the final analysis, ""Wonder Boys"" left me confused and empty, unsure of what the point of the whole endeavor was.  But while I was watching it, I was engrossed in the characters' very illogical lives, wondering if any of it would make sense in the end, but suspicious that it didn't really matter anyway.",990921600,,4819,4.837408312958435
1267475,5,B00003CXDJ,"I tried three times to read the novel and at last am half-way through. The novel, while wonderfully well written, with artful sentences and beautifully stitched paragraphs, lacks suspense. The film, which I saw both in the theater and on DVD, sticks closely to the book and now there's no way one can read Grady Tripp's voice without hearing Michael Douglas, who here out-acts his charming performance as president in The American President. Michael captures Chabon's inflections perfectly. I've come to love this movie and feel that the characters are part of my life. For me, the acting throughout is matchless. Curtis Hanson deserves great credit for not trying to juice up the story. I think this will be one of those addictive movies with locked in pleasures I want to share with all my friends and will sit through ten times without tiring of the subtleties. Probably more than ten times over the years. When you have a can't miss DVD you just have to break it out for friends who haven't seen the film. By the way, the Bob Dylan video of the his Oscar-winning ""Things Have Changed"" is on the DVD and though I've watched it twice, and heard him sing it during the Academy Awards, and even have read the complete lyrics in Entertainment Weekly, well, it still eludes my ear. Aside from ""I'm in love with a women who don't even appeal to me,"" I just can't get most of the lines. I wish I had saved the trot from EW. Pale and smileless as a clown, Bob no longer sells his lyrics the way he did as a youngster where one might savor every word and Rimbaud image.

1267476,5,B00003CXDJ,"I always try very hard not to compare movies to books that they might be based on. I always feel that a film should sink or swim on its own, so to speak. They should be judged as an independent piece of art, because in actuality, that's what they are. After all, every piece of art is going to be based on some experience by the artist. So what if the work is based on another piece of art. That said, the moment that the credits rolled in this film, I felt that I had no choice but to read the book.
That's actually meant to be a compliment. A lot of people will say about a movie ""you should read the book."" And by that, they mean, ""the book is better."" That's not why I wanted to read the book. I was so moved by the film that I wanted an opportunity to totally immerse myself in the world in which it took place. I ordered the book from Amazon the next morning and have only just begun to read it. I can only hope that it will move me as well as the film did. Given the depth of the talents of its Pulitzer Prize winning author, Michael Chabon, I don't expect that I will be disappointed. I will likely write a review of it as well, but I wanted an opportunity to review the film as a piece unto itself first without hampering my opinions based additional knowledge from the book.
What really struck me was how real the film was. At least from my point of view. I felt as though I knew those people. I felt as though I lived that life. Part of that may be due to the fact that I did live that life (I graduated with an English degree from Carnegie Mellon University, where this movie was filmed), but I think a lot of it was also due to honesty with which these characters were portrayed. From Katie Holmes's Hannah, the mysterious cute girl in the class with an obvious crush on the professor to the Michael Douglas's Grady, mildly successful, more of a writer than a teacher with a fine eye for detail that will zone in on a single aspect to sum up the entire character and personality of a real life individual (like her feet).
This film is beautiful. I mean it simply breathtaking. I was enrolled at CMU for six and a half years. As I said before, I have been to each location seen in that film more times than I can count, but I can honestly say that I saw the campus in an entirely new light and I will never be able to look at it the same way again. The scenery makes this picture. I've lived in Pittsburgh for nearly a decade, but whenever anyone asks me where I am from, I have always told them Cleveland (my original hometown). But after seeing what the film crew did here, I am proud to live in Pittsburgh. A little bit of movie magic has turned this burned out steel city into a thing of beauty. And I mean movie magic. The movie was actually filmed during an uncharacteristically warm winter. Almost all the snow in the film is fake. It was astounding to see the crew pumping fake snow out all over the place during filming, but it comes across wonderfully realistic in the film.
I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. I watch a lot of movies, and I can usually find something nice to say about almost all of them. But it is very seldom that I see a film that touches me in the same way that this one did (the most recent before this was American Beauty). I especially recommend this film to anyone who is familiar with Pittsburgh; the creative writing process or who has at some point found themselves at a difficult crossroads in life. In short, I recommend the movie to anyone like me. But the thing is, I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't like me. Go see this film. You'll be glad you did. And if by any chance you are anything like me, then perhaps you will find a bit of yourself in this film. Perhaps you will find out that you're a Wonder Boy as well.",989798400,8,3790,4.1578231292517005

Katie Holmes is better than her personal average in her role.  Frances McDormand is about on par with her other roles (which is rather good).  If you like strong plot elements, this movie will probably disappoint you.  There are a few things that get started early on, but they're mainly just excuses for the characters to interact.

1267478,4,B00003CXDJ,"I know I shouldn't have let it got to me but, I can't help it. I really got mad after reading through some of the comments other's made about this movie. I never had any sort of intention to review this movie, but people's comments enraged me so I had to.  As we should all know by now this was the first movie Curtis Hanson made after ""L.A. Confidential"". I never understood why the public makes such a big deal about a director's next project after they have a hit. Why don't they concern themself with the hit movie instead? Anyway, I saw ""Wonder Boys"" when it came out in theathers, and I really enjoyed it. I thought the acting by the entire cast had it moments. Everyone at one point of the film was given a scene where they were allowed to shine. Michael Douglas plays Grady Tripp, a struggling novelist, who had a hit novel once before, but for some reason can't seem to finish his new novel. It already is well over a 1,000 pages. If that isn't bad enough for Tripp, he finds out that his friend\editor (Robert Downey Jr.) is coming in town to check up on how Gripp's novel is going. His girlfriend\mistress has just informed him that she is going to have a baby, she is played quite amusingly by Francis McDormand. And, his wife is now going to divorce him. Yep, it sounds like the begining of a perfect day for Grady Tripp. Now, why the American public has a problem with this story-line is beyond me. If I were to read this on someone else's review I would think it sounds like a good,funny comedy that would seem enjoyable to watch. The movie based on a novel by Michael Chabon, with a screenplay by Steven Kloves does have it's moments of sentiment and laughter. It's tender while being humorous. And that's why I like the movie. It tries to seem ""human"" while it's outragous at the same time. When thinking back on the movie it sorta reminds me of old screwball comedies. Not that the movie has slapstick to it, but if you've ever seen movies like ""The Awful Truth"", you'll know what I'm talking about. I read one reviewer bash the title of the movie, OK, now, we're going to far, now we're just bashing the movie just for the sake of bashing it. That, is not a good reason to say you hate a movie, I'm sorry. You have to give a better reason then that. Comment on the acting, the screenplay, the directing, but not the title! I only take one star off this movie because I felt that it would of been better if they went into the whole Katie Holmes (Hannah Green)\ Michael Douglas relationship. This was a great movie, one I really enjoyed, and it in my opinion was one of the best films of 2000! Everyone should try to make an effort to see this movie. Those that have and didn't enjoy it, I'm sorry you had such an awful time, let some time pass and try to watch the movie again, who knows, maybe you might like it.",988848000,,2831,4.291588785046729

The appearance of Vernon is a shameful attempt to twist the plot in a comical way, but it fails miserably. All in all, Hanson dropped the ball here.

1267563,3,B00003CXDJ,"I liked this movie in the theater, although, as others here have noted, one has to forgive the cloyingly sentimental ending (the original novel handles this better, but not that much better).  The performances by Douglas, McDormand, Downey and especially Toby Maguire are first rate.  As a matter of fact, I pre-ordered it from Amazon the day after I saw it.  Seeing it again on DVD produced mixed emotions.

First:  I mean really ""first.""  Before the movie starts, the screen is filled with the HORRIFYING message:  ""This film has been edited for content.""  WHAT????  This set up a sense of foreboding that never left me as I watched the movie.  Not to worry: the content that was actually edited turns out to be in the list of celebrity suicides cited by Tobey in what I suppose is the movie's first act:  Evidently, the theatrical version contained factual mistake[s].

Second:  The sound is pretty dull.  You'd think a picture that won its only Oscar for best song would have a digital track.  It does not.  Dolby 5.0 and 2.0 are your choices.  Neither very attractive.

Third: Extra Features - REALLY lame.  A running commentary by director Hanson would have been nice.  The book's author, Michael Chabon, would have been even better.  As it is, we get a whimsical tour through Pittsburg with the director.  Blyuuck.

Fourth:  There are annoying spots in the transfer where the image gets stuck and lines of dialog are lost. I know this has something to do with ""layering"" and, apparently, can't be avoided, but I've never seen it as bad as on this DVD.

Summing up:  This movie never got the attention it deserved from audiences, and now it has gotten a sloppy DVD transfer.  What a shame, because this was one of the better movies of 2000.",987638400,24,1746,4.695364238410596
1267564,4,B00003CXDJ,"I generally enjoy all of Michael Douglas's work and this was no exception. He does a very able job playing Grady Tripp, a creative writing instructor at a college despite his not having produced a second novel after his glittering first novel of seven years ago.  Set over a weekend, this is a comic look at everything that goes comicly wrong in Tripp's (Douglas's) life, from the women in it to the students to his literary agent and beyond.  I LOL when I saw him working on his 2,000 page book manuscript that he typed on a typewriter, for God's sake!

The fate of this manuscript during the course of this movie is pretty comedic in and of itself.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and stuck right with it.  However, I notice that a few other Amazon reviewers mention that they thought it was slow.  I didn't have that problem with it but I did notice that hubby dozed off a time or two during it.  This is not gripping, hard hitting material by any means and it is possible that others may find it slow as well.  Nevertheless, it is a good evening's entertainment for you and I recommend it.

1267566,4,B00003CXDJ,"Wonder Boys is a relatively uneventful picture yet somehow at the film's conclusion it's lead characters (and even a few of the secondary ones too) have arched, changing their lives forever.  If I had to describe it in one word it would be ""subtle.""  Maybe a little too subtle for audiences stateside who despite rave reviews from critics, basically panned the movie with a domestic box office take in the high teens.  This from a movie that boasts L.A. Confidential director Curtis Hanson, megastar Michael Douglas and a winning soundtrack of classic songs that includes an original number by Bob Dylan, which also happens to be possibly the best song written for a film, ever!
Douglas stars in one of his most unglamorous roles to date as Grady Tripp.  He's an aging professor and acclaimed author who after seven years has yet to complete his much anticipated follow-up to his award-winning debut novel, Arsonists Daughter.  He's encountering a form of writers block that rather than disallowing him to write, won't let him stop.  His new book is now well over two thousand pages and as he puts it, ""The ending seems to keep getting further away.""  His personal life is equally muddled.  He's in love with the boss' wife (Frances McDormand) who also happens to be the chancellor of the university, going on his second divorce and finds himself involved with a student (Maguire) who triggers feelings of unfulfilled promise in him.
James (Maguire), seeming particularly depressed one night, reaches out to Grady and the two embark on a journey of self-discovery that's as much a coming-of-age tale for this fifty-something professor as it is his student, thirty years his junior.  This is a recurring message in the movie, that it's never too late to rediscover yourself.  Their misadventures begin on the opening night of the university's annual gala Word Fest.  Grady's publisher (Robert Downey, Jr.) is in town to swipe a peek at this long overdue novel, one of his most fetching students (Toledo's own Katie Holmes) is making advances, and with his marriage already on the rocks his girlfriend announces to him that she's pregnant.
These are extraordinary events that unfold in a very realistic, true-to-life way which is what makes them so easy to relate to.  It's not a film about overnight reformation but the simple intricacies of life and the gradual changes we encounter along the way.  For Grady the transitions have been so refined that even he doesn't realize how far he's fallen from the person he aspired to become.  Expectations have dampened his spirit and he's become so afraid of making a mistake that he refuses to make choices as to which way he wants to steer his life in.  At this point he's just wandering through life without any real sense of purpose.  This is beautifully expressed in Dylan's song, ""Things Have Changed.""  In this five minute anthem he manages to capture the essence of the picture and nail it down to such an extent that it's almost as telling as the film itself.
You see, the music is all a part of the story-telling process.  Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Neil Young almost have as great of claims to writing credits as Oscar nominated scribe Steve Kloves.  This is essential because it brings in people from all walks of life.  As Douglas sits in his broken down car, smoking a joint, reading James' manuscript with Neil Young belting out ""Old Man,"" we understand the significance of the moment without him ever having to say a word.
If I have any complaints about the movie it would have to be that the ending is a little too neat for my taste.  But that doesn't deter from my appreciation of this wonderful film that may have been lost on some but wasn't on me, and hopefully won't be on you either.",987552000,,3749,4.763523956723338
1267567,5,B00003CXDJ,"""Wonder Boys"" is a quirky yet very entertaining comedy.  It represents something old yet something new from Michael Douglas in that although he is once again playing a dark, conflicted character, this time the portrayal is for comedic effect.
Douglas' character is Grady Tripp, a drugged out professor of literature whose life has slowly but steadily gone out of control since publishing the great American novel seven years earlier.  His third wife has just left him and the wife of his boss (Frances McDormand), with whom he has been having an affair, is pregnant with his child.
These plot twists and several more, such as a dead dog, the theft of a jacket once owned by Marilyn Monroe, Tripp's desparate female-impersonator dating literary agent (Robert Downey Junior), a brooding but brilliant writing student (Tobey Maguire, who has a gift for remembering celebrity suicides) and some crazy guy claiming that Grady's car belongs to him, all clash during a weekend writing festival being held at the college where Douglas teaches.  The twists, turns, and interaction of all of these plot elements and characters provides for some dark but incredibly funny comedy.
Surprisingly there are a number of negative reviews of this picture...., for example, says Maguire is ""smarmy"" and ""ruins every picture he's been in"".  She's wrong.  Maguire stands out as one of the best of his generation of actors.  ""She also refers to Douglas' voice as ""droning"" and makes it quite clear she never liked his acting to begin with.  I wonder why she even bothered to watch this film in the first place given her attitude and disdain for the actors.
Although some may choose to dismiss ""Wonder Boys"" as ""trashy"", pretentious, or just too dark, I actually think this could be one of the best motion pictures Michael Douglas has done in a while, and another tour-de-force bit of direction by Curtis Hanson (""L. A. Confidential"").  This film also includes a very good soundtrack featuring Bob Dylan's Oscar winning song ""Things Have Changed.""
The DVD is loaded with extras including cast and director interviews, a discussion of the music used in the film, and a map of various shooting locations.  Just as in ""L.A. Confidential"", director Hanson does a very good job of explaining the creative process in the making of the picture although his recitation sounds canned.
""Wonder Boys"" is defintely not a comedy for those who just want to sit there and be entertained.  You have to engage yourself in it to understand the comedy, but the payoff is worth the trouble. Watch it and decide for yourself.",987379200,,2581,4.953703703703703

Michael Douglas and Robert Downey Jr were excellent, but they usually are. I rented this movie because of my respect for L.A. Confidential (in my top 10 movies of all time) which was directed by the same director, Curtis Hanson. I'd like to track down all his films now.

1267569,2,B00003CXDJ,"I don't think that the problem of Curtis Hanson's WONDER BOYS lies in its screenplay. Even if the influence of Martin Scorsese's AFTER HOURS is patent. Michal Douglas, like the hero of Scorsese's movie, is the passive witness or victim of a succession of strange events. The symbolic beginning of this journey into wonderland is a dog's bite. Curtis Hanson will never miss an occasion to remind us of Michal Douglas's painful leg as long as the dream isn't over.
No, the problem lies elsewhere. In fact, WONDER BOYS misses the mark simply because you don't care about the characters. It wouldn't have been so important if the intention of the director would have been to present a comic movie but since WONDER BOYS is a psychological comedy, the lack of interest you feel for the characters involved is fatal.
I really don't care about Michal Douglas's problems with his wife, his lack of inspiration or with Frances Mc Dormand. Robert Downey and Tobey Maguire characters are shallow and empty. And frankly, I don't have the slightest desire to read Douglas's first book "" The Arsonist's Daughter "" if it would have been really written.

1267700,1,B00003CXDJ,"Whether in voice-over or actually speaking, Michael Douglas' wooden, droning, unmodulated performance is not as animated as the ubiquitous monolith in 2001, a Space Odyssey. The actors and director must have been under some contractual obligation, for not since Steve Miller's ''Hearts Like a Wheel'' album of the late 70's has anything so horrible been released. To be fair, Frances McDormand was good. Robert Downey, Jr.'s camped-up, bug-eyed character was a little over the top, but his acting was at least on par with that of the baby McDormand carried in the final scene. Smarmy Tobey Maquire ruins every movie he's in. The only way this video will be worth the purchase price is if you open it and find instead ''Gladiator''.",986860800,5,731,5.0
1267701,3,B00003CXDJ,"First, I must say that the acting in this movie is monumentally, and universally great!  Douglas does his duty.  His performance is very reminscient of his role in ""The Game"" which is, to me, a five star film.  And Downey performs his usual magic (it's just a shame that such talent is wasted in such a lifestyle - he is so good, I just wish he gets his act together before the courts get it together for him).

But the movie was inspiration for one thing - a new moniker for me: ""bottle-rocket plot development.""  You briefly hear a hissing noise, something flys off in an random, odd direction, then BANG!  It's gone.

Characters appear out of nowhere, do something seemingly random or bizzare, then disappear.  I believe that fully HALF the cast of characters could have been completely left out (along with their lines) with no perceptible effect on the story at all.

Often, a plot thread is introduced and just as quickly disappears.  It's brought back, sometimes, about half an hour later or longer, and reintroduced.  The filmmakers seem to not realize that 45 minutes have passed with not so much as a mention of it.  Do they really believe that we haven't noticed it's been missing in action all that time?

Example.  An elderly couple come home and find a strange young man in their house, lying on their couch, smoking a joint and drinking their whiskey.  Next scene? ""How about some hot chocolate and cookies, dear?""  Please.  I don't care how comfortable you are with the guy he showed up with (Douglas), but who's going to go from wondering if they are being robbed to ""cocoa and cookies, dear?""

The movie, expertly portrayed as it is, plateaus immediately and maintains all the way to the sudden end.  Professor Tripp's exceptionally strange 36 hour romp is unexceptionally dull in it's relation to the viewer.

It's probably worth a watch if you, like the professor, toke on a doobie for the duration.

The movie portrays little or no gratuitous violence, bad language, or nudity - to it's credit.  I really do not understand it's ""R"" rating.  Perhaps the homosexual inuendo and portrayal (but NOT romaticized) drug use are the cause.

1267704,4,B00003CXDJ,"""Wonder Boys"" is a dark and intelligent comedy about choices.  Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a college professor who is the constant victim of the circumstances of his own life.  On the day we meet him, his wife has left him and the chancellor of the college (Frances McDormand) with whom he has been having an affair tells him that she is pregnant.  Add to that the fact that his star student has killed the chancellor's dog, and that his editor is in town to talk to him about the book he hasn't finished, and Grady is suddenly awash in crises that require pivotal decisions.  Unfortunately, deciding is not his forte.
The humor in Steven Kloves (""The Fabulous Baker Boys"") screenplay is more that of dire irony rather than the whimsical inanity that characterizes most film comedies.  As such, the film didn't have much mass appeal, garnering a meager $19 million at the box office despite a very bankable cast.  Nevertheless, this excellent screenplay merited a Best Screenplay nomination from the Academy, and it is full of thoughtful dialogue and wry humor.
Michael Douglas is terrific as the overwrought college professor.  Douglas shows a great deal of versatility here; playing an offbeat and tortured character that is unlike any he has played before.  Tobey Maguire (""Pleasantville"", ""The Cider House Rules"") turns in another fine performance expanding his boundaries with a much heavier and complex role.  He gives the character a moody depth that is both devious and impassive while maintaining a certain insecure naivet.  Frances McDormand, as usual, delivers a strong supporting performance as the chancellor at a crossroad.  Robert Downey, Jr. is also fantastic as the quirky literary agent, adding a touch of absurdity to the otherwise dour script.
Bob Dillon won an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for Best Song, and deservingly so.
This is a strong film that will appeal to a limited audience.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a thought provoking and somber character study that is well worth the time for the serious viewer.",985910400,5,2041,4.932748538011696
1267705,5,B00003CXDJ,"""Wonder Boys"" is a perfect example of how you do not have to embarass yourself to make a funny movie.  Where most comic films today go for shock and other low brow means to garner laughs, ""Wonder Boys"" takes you by surprise. Which is how comedy truly works.  Michael Douglas is wonderful as Grady Tripp. A former best selling novelist, now working as a creative writing professor in the Northeast. Like most successful first time novelists, Tripp, hasn't been able to duplicate his success.  He instead finds himself doubting his abilities and not able to follow through on his current project.  Not helping matters is his taboo relationship with his bosses wife, played with quiet intensity by Frances McDormand, who informs Tripp, she is pregnant. Tripp's weekend is further complicated by the arrival of his editor played by Robert Downey Jr, in one of his best performances.  Downey's character is desperate to get his hands on Tripp's still unfinished manuscript.  To keep both Douglas and Downey busy is the arrival of James Leer (Tobey Maguire). One of Tripp's students, who is slightly off kilter.  Leer sets the wheels in motion when he ""takes care of"" Tripp's bosses dog, and commandeers a very special item of his as well.  To continue with plot points would be to risk giving away too much of a great film, which demands attention.  Don't get up to leave at any point unless you pause this movie. It rarely backtracks, and in that way keeps the story moving and fresh. All the performances are spectacular, especially Katie Holmes, who will not be one of our great young film actresses until she can manage away from ""The Creek.""  However, after performances like this, Go, and The Gift she is headed in the right direction. Excellently written by Steve Kloves and Directed by Curtis Hanson, ""Wonder Boys"" is a special treat for filmgoers, a very funny film about the writing profession, which too many people take for granted.",985737600,4,1939,4.848484848484849

The cast is terrific with each character playing wonderfully off the other.  Hanson's work as a director requires multiple viewings to catch and appreciate what an effort he has put into the film.

Score: 83/100
Gracious! Is that Michael Douglas, playing a pothead, with crinkly skin and oldie-oldie hair? Yes, it is, and he is a star in this film. He's not the only star of the film, though; Curtis Hanson's second film may not reach the standards of L.A. Confidential, but it surely the best college film in a long time, and is work of a high standard.
Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a professor/writer living in Pittsburgh who is struggling with writer's block. Whilst doing this, he also manages to get the chancellor (Frances McDormand) pregnant. In the meantime, he and a college student, James Leer (Tobey Maguire) are trying to find a rare jacket once owned by Marilyn Monroe, and a college girl, Hannah Green (Katie Holmes) boarding with Grady has a bit of a crush on him.
My expectations were a little high of Wonder Boys. I expected it to maybe earn over a score of 90, since Curtis Hanson went absolutely genius with the material given to him in L.A. Confidential. Even thought it didn't earn that high, the film is still a great piece of entertainment, one of the most plausible adult comedies of 2000. Michael Douglas is, as I said, a star. He deserved two Oscar nominations for this and Traffic, but hey, how dumb is the Academy? Douglas deserves some kind of award for absolutely ensemble performance. Tobey Maguire and Katie Holmes are good too - except Holmes is slightly underused - and both will provide plenty of laughs and body for teen and young adult audiences. Curtis Hanson is laid-back in this film, he knows exactly what he's doing, and does it like a master. The film comes and goes, it leaves us with not a fast enough pace sometimes. But with such cleverness and some flashy brilliant script writing, you won't have the time to notice.

1267708,4,B00003CXDJ,"Adapted from the novel by Michael Chabon, this offbeat dark comedic drama is set at a college in Pittsburgh, a shabby city of bleak weather and aging buildings.  Michael Douglas is cast in the role of Grady Tripp, a college professor long past his prime who lives in haze of marijuana and failing marriages.  He's gained weight for this role and his face is lined and drooping, capturing the essence of the character so well that he was able to submerge his movie star image.  Tripp is a former ""wonder boy"" who had been acclaimed for his first novel seven years before.  Unfortunately, even though he has written more than 2000 pages on his second novel, he can't seem to bring it to completion even though his New York agent, Terry Crabtree, played by Robert Downey Jr. will be in town for the writer's weekend set up at the college.
Tobey Maguire, the rising young actor who made a name for himself in ""The Cedar House Rules"" is cast as James Leer, a brilliant and troubled young writer from Tripp's class.  And Frances McDormand is cast as the Chancellor of the college who's having an affair with Trip.  Katie Holmes plays a student who is interested in Tripp for more than his teaching ability.  Other characters fade in and out of the scenes, adding interest and contributing to an eclectic mix and which somehow all add to the cohesive whole.  There's a transvestite as well as a professor affixed on Marilyn Monroe as well as a black man in a pompadour hairdo and his waitress wife. And, in addition to the people, there's a vintage car and an old manual typewriter and an electric selectric.  There's also a dead dog.
All this is put together in a mix that gently pokes fun at it all, played for pathos and humanity instead of slapstick.  And it is all slightly off focus in the marijuana haze created by the professor.  I did find it a bit slow and I sometimes dozed off.  But the beauty of video is that could wake up and replay the few frames I missed.  I was always rewarded because of the subtleties of dialog and nuances of the acting and of the fine direction by Curtis Hanson, whose last film was L.A. Confidential.  I recommend this video although it is not for everyone.  It's quirky and offbeat and the pace is slow and hazy.  But I personally thought it was really good.",985651200,,2292,4.486746987951808
1267777,3,B00003CXDJ,"After seeing this one a second time, I've got to go against my initial review (which was pretty bad). It's just not the kind of film that will appeal to everyone. Michael Douglas does a nice bit of acting as the conflicted writer who discovers a prodigy, loses a wife, resists a beautiful student, hides a body, and steals Marylin Monroe's jacket - all in one long, wild night. Brainy and chic, it's worth seeing at least for his performance.",985651200,3,442,4.5375
1267778,2,B00003CXDJ,"This was a bad film.  It's clear why the film didn't receive more notice from the Academy Awards.  All it has going for it is a talented cast, and the ridiculous script irritates much more than entertains.  The characters motivations are always questionable, although Michael Douglas is consistently likable.  All in all, I think you'll find this movie is not as good as you thought it would be.",985564800,,395,4.764705882352941

Take a well-written, creative script, interspersed with comedic wit, mix with wonderful acting by all participants, and you end up with a truly unique movie.  A poignant story about a youthful writer who inspires a washed up writer-turned-teacher to see life the way it's meant to be viewed: in its simplest form.  A very enjoyable movie.",985564800,,483,4.726190476190476
1267780,4,B00003CXDJ,"Seriously, when I first saw the cast list for Wonder Boys, I cringed upon the sight of Katie Holmes and Tobey Maguire.  But, in all reality, Wonder Boys is a really good film.  Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as Professor Tripp, a guy who's definitely going through some life changes.  Overall, he's a pretty cool guy, a smart english professor, bestselling author, drunk, and habitual marijuana smoker.  Robert Downey, Jr. is also great as Tripp's editor Crabtree.  Typical Robert Downey, Jr. fare as he plays a gay urbanite whose seeking to resurrect his fading career.  Frances Mcdormand gives a great performance as Sara, the Chancellor's wife, gritty and tough as ever.  There are some really funny moments in Wonder Boys especially the scenes with Po, the Chancellor's dog and Crabtree's transvestite date.  I'm not sure if they rewrote the ending because at the beginning of the movie it says ""This film has been edited for content.""  The ending is a little too sweet for me to swallow but otherwise it's very well acted and directed fare.",985564800,,1065,4.905027932960894
1267781,5,B00003CXDJ,"What an underrated but spectacular film. I saw it in the cinema when it was originally released. Michael Douglas gives the performance of a lifetime as a burned out, pot smoking English professor who published a book a decade ago, which was met with critical and commercial success, and has been working on the follow up (all 2000+ aimless pages of it) for the ten years since. His wife leaves him, his agent (Robert Downey, Jr.) comes to town, he deals with a suicidal, compulsive liar but brilliant student of his (Tobey Maguire), and he discovers his girlfriend (a fantastic Frances McDormand) is pregnant with his child. She happens to be the chancellor of the university where he teaches. Her husband is the head of the English department in which he works. Douglas as Grady Tripp is amazing as he drifts from one crisis to the next, never quite making decisions and trying to put band-aids on all the problems in his life. The dialogue is intelligent and witty, the acting is superb all around, and although the ending comes and ends neatly, it is still a nearly perfect film. Such a shame more people did not see it.",985564800,7,1123,4.648241206030151

I am surprised today that all these famous (some award winners!) agreed to have their name attached to this movie. Problems with the movie are: 1- the characters are not likeable or dislikable enough for the viewer to care. 2- The story line does not make any sense. You follow these guys aimlessly plotting their way through nonsense!! 3- The actors looked like they did not care of how the movie would come out. I haven't seen bad acting like this in years. No wonder I never heard of this movie while it was in theatres!",985478400,9,654,4.598290598290598
1267783,5,B00003CXDJ,"So here's the scoop about this DVD. I'm not a big Michael Douglas fan. Not a big Robery Downey Jr. fan. And not a big fan of Pittsburgh, either. But, after seeing their two performances in this masterful piece of artwork which showcases the best of this huge Pennsylvania hamlet, I'm a big fan of all three.
Wonder Boys spins the tale of Professor Tripp, new protege James Leer (brilliantly acted by the soon-to-reckoned with Tobey MacGuire), a feisty editor named Crabtree, and a confused Chancellor (by the amazing Frances McDormand), all meshing and re-meshing together over the course of a turbulent, bridge building weekend. Their paths are multiple and complicated; there is no room to rest in this film. You never doubt its story, up to its satisfying and right conclusion. You cannot go wrong with Wonder Boys.
The DVD version is of good quality, yet lacking the now-expected director's commentary that would enlighten us even more about this film. His commentary on the Pittsburgh locations shed a little light on this film, but leaves you wanting more. Don't miss this cinematic, and sadly overlooked, treasure.",985392000,14,1121,5.0
1267784,5,B00003CXDJ,"The true test of this movie's winning nature and detailed focus on college academia and campus politics was when my husband, who teaches at a local college,  said he loved it (he was laughing throughout this movie). If I tried to give a bare bones outline of the plot, however, I'm afraid I'd discourage your interest but let me say that this one is far, far more than the sum of its various parts. I was a bit surprised, to say the least, that the same director made both this movie and L.A. Confidential. Then again, maybe that just shows how truly talented he is, able to do a superb job on such diverse films.  The biggest shock to me, however, was Michael Douglas. Looking every bit the part of a rather burned out, over the hill man facing personal and professonal setbacks, Douglas gave an amazingly skillful performance, actually reining himself in at times and then letting loose, but only when necessary. I'm glad he has learned to make the transition from handsome young man to an actor who has learned to use his maturity with grace and skill in films.  I'm used to seeing him in action-packed or suspense movies - the only movies of his that seemed even similar to his performance in Wonder Boys were Falling Down and The Game.. To my mind, Wonder Boys is the most compelling perfomance so far, mainly because of the humor that lightens the darkest moments.  Don't let me give you the impression that this movie is depressing and gloomy. It is often funny, even laugh out loud funny, and Toby Macquire, Robert Downey Jr, Francis McDormand and Rip Torn (that IS Rip Torn, isn't it?) hold their own in their roles. Katie Holmes is also quite compelling as a young student smitten by Douglas.  Often unpredictable and quite original, I'd put this high on your priority list of must-see movies. It is truly one of the best movies around. We watched Almost Famous the same evening and if I had to choose between the two, personally I'd chose Wonder Boys. This may be partly a function of being older - my teenage son preferred Almost Famous.",985392000,,2049,4.572207084468665
1267785,4,B00003CXDJ,"""Wonder Boys,"" directed by Curtis Hanson, explores some events in the life of a pot-smoking college professor (played by Michael Douglas) who is rapidly heading towards personal and professional crises. Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, this film is enlivened by witty dialogue and some terrific performances.
Michael Douglas is the star of this film, and he really shines. He delivers a delightfully droll performance as the professor who is torn between his conflicting personal and professional commitments. The script walks the line between comedy and drama, and Douglas hits this balance perfectly. His performance in ""Wonder Boys"" is a stunning complement to his equally outstanding work in Steven Soderbergh's gritty drama ""Traffic,"" released in the same year.
The supporting cast is also very good. I especially liked Tobey Maguire as Douglas' morbid, but oddly loveable student protege. And Robert Downey Jr. is a delight as Douglas' editor. Unfortunately, the female characters seem a bit underdeveloped, although Frances McDormand and Katie Holmes do their best with the material.
I found ""Wonder Boys"" to be flawed in some respects. In particular, the film's ending left me somewhat unsatisfied. But the wonderful performances make this film richly entertaining. And as a satire of academia and the publishing industry, it hits some intriguing notes. Give it a try.",985305600,4,1381,5.398148148148148
1267786,5,B00003CXDJ,"I am so glad I finally saw this movie and will surely be watching it again. What a fantastic cast - and a wonderful study of the characters as the movie slowly moves through a wacky winter weekend at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, the site of a writers' conference.
Michael Douglas brilliantly portrays Grady, a seedy, pot-smoking professor who published one successful novel 7 years ago and cannot manage to complete a new book (even though he has written over 2,000 pages!). Hia life is further complicated by his affair with the university chancellor and his young wife's abandonment.
Toby Maguire (James)plays to perfection the role of a confused student of Douglas'--confused about life and his sexuality--who has written a book but is also a compulsive liar.
Robert Downey, Jr. is Douglas' long-suffering agent who shows up for the conference with a transvestite and ends up with James. He plays his part effortlessly.
The movie follows James and Grady (in pain from a dog bite) as they drive around the city in Grady's old Fairlaine with a dead dog, a pistol, and a jacket that once belonged to Marilyn Monroe.
What I especially liked about this movie is that it did not try to manufacture any false laughs--it is funny without really trying, genuinely funny. But I would never classify this as a comedy as so many of the early ads seemed to do. It is much more than that---a touching and lovely movie about people and their foibles.",985219200,5,1440,4.78714859437751
1267895,1,B00003CXDJ,"You know a film is bad when you can't wait for it to end, and that's exactly what was happening as I watched Wonder Boys.  Yes, it has a superb cast, but that's the only high point.  The rest of the movie was a mash of horrible plots, bad scripting, and redundant scenery.  Maybe my expectations for this movie were too high.  Maybe after hearing how great this film was, I had expectations that the film could never meet.  I'm not sure why I hated this movie so much, other than it moved me only to boredom.  It lacked inspiration, it lacked hope, it lacked the reasons why I watch films in the first place.

1267896,5,B00003CXDJ,"Wonder Boys is without a doubt one of the best films I have watched in the past year. It is another one of those black comedies in which an aging man goes through a midlife crisis..Does anyone remember American Beauty?  This film reminded me of Beauty a little bit.  I thought it was a very well written screenplay, and I loved Alan Ball's screenplay even better(Beauty).  The main character is played brilliantly by Michael Douglas, and the movie pretty much centers around him.  I don't know if Wonder Boys will sweep the Oscars like Beauty did, but I think it deserves a few nods.-- Best Actor, best screenplay, and best director.  Like American Beauty, I don't think this film is for everybody.  It plays like a drama, but has comedic moments thrown in.  I could rehash what the film is about like everyone else here, but I just want to voice that I think it is an excellent film that I was very entertained by.  It was funny and though not fast paced, was very engrossing.  Not to mention the amazing acting!! This film was a springboard for some of the best acting in the year 2000 -- Robert Downey Jr., Tobey McGuire, and Frances McDormand.  If you are a fan of any of these actors, especially Michael Douglas, you will appreciate this movie.",985046400,2,1249,4.535714285714286

It was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, with outstanding performances by the whole cast (especially Michael Douglas and the aforementioned Robert Downey, Jr. who is always great).  I am inspired by great acting and this film was exactly that - inspiring!",984787200,7,570,4.367924528301887
1267898,4,B00003CXDJ,"Michael Douglas' last prime class film - and for some reason I can only remember very well done films with this actor (!) - is called ""Wonder Boys."" It is a slow paced film about life's purest comedy and about its most bohemic dramas. It borrows some of the adventurous spirit and absurd comedy of ""Feeling Minnesotta,"" some of ""Fargo""'s impossible winter, some of the artists' poetic nature from ""Being John Malkovich,"" and some of the innocence of the young dreams of ""Dead Poets Society."" It is a film with and about wonder boys, super boys, extraordinary boys - of all ages, occupations, and sexual orientations. But not only this. It also features a very ""adult"" (as in mature) female character - coherent and real - played superbly by Frances McDormand. In the front line shine Michael Douglas (who will most likely NOT get the Academy Award for this one because the entire film can easily be misunderstood), Tobey Maguire (from ""The Cider House Rules,"" which every day I regret having not seen yet), and Robert Downey Jr.....
Hollywood does not make too often films that are both realistic and well done - ""Wonder Boys"" is a rare bird and should not be missed. If you see it and by the end you find yourself not falling in love with at least one of the wonder boys described (most likely you will fall for the one played by Tobey Maguire) than there is something wrong with you. And this has nothing to do with sexual orientations in the least.",984787200,3,1451,4.6061776061776065

Not only is this a film filled with delectable characters brilliantly acted by such solid performers as Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, and Robert Downey, Jr.,and Richard Thomas, it has a pacing by Director Curtis Hanson that simply sweeps you along with a very madcap story.  And as with all good comedy writing there is a strong message about individual worth and the concept of heroism that completes the package.  This is very fine film making, worth owning for repeated viewings.  I think this is Michael Douglas' finest hour.",984787200,6,592,5.010204081632653
1267900,5,B00003CXDJ,"Curtis Hanson's follow-up to his brilliant 'LA Confidential' is equally amazing but in a completely different way. 'Wonder Boys' is a wonderfully skewed comedy, with characters who zig and zag across the screen, weaving in through each others lives, and ultimately finding salvation in each other. Michael Douglas gives his second-great performance of 2000 (the other being in 'Traffic') as Professor Grady Tripp, a chronic pot-smoking, english teacher/author who has had great success in the past with his first novel. Problem is, he can't seem to finish his follow-up and he's been trying for years. He is having an affair with a married chancellor at his school (Frances McDormand in HER sceond great performance of the year, the other being in 'Almost Famous'). His barely-in-the-closet editor (the incredible Robert Downey Jr.) is breathing down his throat and a student of his (Katie Holmes) is trying to get in his pants. Not only that he has the chancellor's dead dog in his trunk, thanks to a mishap with a bewildered, mysterious student of his (Tobey Maguire at his usual excellence) and the car he's driving may or may not be stolen. Over the course of one hellish weekend, Grady Tripp will find out what it means to be in charge of one's own life and the way making a simple choice can change things for the better. The movie rides smoothly from start to finish thanks to great, assured direction by Hanson and smooth screenwriting by Steve Kloves (from the novel by Michael Chabon). It's a truly amazing film, whose character's are so well developed and layered that we never know what to expect of them at any given moment. In fact, anywhere you think this movie might be going at any given time, you will more then likely be wrong. It's surprising and heart-felt, as funny as it is involving, as moving as it is intelligent. And you won't find a better performance then Douglas's in any film this year. It's a true stand-out role for him, a break from his normal obsessive, hard-headed monsters. And he is brilliant. And so is Tobey Maguire, who continues to dazzle with every film. One of the best films of 2000.",984614400,58,2128,4.7853260869565215
1267901,4,B00003CXDJ,"Since a plot summary has already been mentioned, I'll forgo the usual style of reviews.  I really enjoyed this film and on many different levels.  There's something emotionally picaresque about Hanson's ode to college life.  Perhaps from a personal standpoint, the nostalgia that lingers from my college days is conjured-up so affectively by this movie about 3 generations of English-lit men.  I, myself, was an English major with aspirations (still) of becoming a writer and I believe this film captures, in it's essence, the simultaneous perils that face each option on screen. From the misunderstood undergraduate who, while misguided, is a literary bright-spot but who must contend with the outside world in order to maintain a social standing in which to present his work, the mid 30's career editor, who perhaps not the greatest writer, has an eye for good literature, and who has to struggle with the business details of creative art and finally our protagonist, a 50 year old writer/educator who must let go of the trappings the other two face in order to feel free to create on his own terms.
For anyone who went to college, this film will make you surrender to every flight of fancy, every idealistic notion you ever held before entering the ""real world."" It will conjure up the ruminations of past regrets when the choices made may not have led you to the end you idealized, but it will show you that it wasn't all for naught, and that everyone gets a second chance.
Dylan's theme song is so appropriate and such a perfect match that this alone makes the film worth the money.  In fact, one can almost see Bob Dylan's career and the plight of a lot of baby boomers in Hanson's film.  People born out of ideals and dreams supported by the academic world and the intelligentsia, who've grown cynical by the world's reaction to them, but have nonetheless withstood the ""Pittsburgh snow storms"" and are ageless, if a little disheveled, rocks for which the young can bounce their own ideals off of.",984614400,4,2004,4.794202898550725

So I rented it and have to say that there really isn't anything special here.  In fact, I ended up watching it in three different sessions as I fell asleep during the first two portions that I watched.  That says something on its own.
I think that Curtis Hanson was trying to make an intellectual slapstick comedy when he made Wonder Boys.  But that combination just doesn't work here as the disasters faced by the main characters aren't very funny.  I thought that the only performance worth talking about was that of Poe, the blind dog who meets an unfortunate end.

As his eccentric editor (Robert Downey Jr.) urges him to complete his novel, Grady's life is going up in smoke.
Over a single, chaotic weekend, Grady, must deal with his unfinished novel, a deeply troubled student (Tobey Maguire), the married chancellor of his university (Frances McDormand) who is having his baby, and his sexy student boarder (Katie Holmes).
Things spin out-of-control for Grady, as, (for the first time in his life) he tries to get control of his life.
""Wonder Boys"" is one of the best films of the year; comedic, and touching, the film works on all levels, and keeps the viewer dazzled.
In the best performance of his career, Michael Douglas, takes the role of Grady, and has him explode off the screen.  The first rate supporting cast of Robert Downey Jr., Frances McDormand, Tobey Maguire, and Katie Holmes help keep the laughs coming in this dark comedy.
Director Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) does an exceptional job of bringing the bestselling novel by Michael Chabon to the screen.
Place ""Wonder Boys"" on your must see list, for it's one of the  best movies of the year.

The movie manages to capture the atmosphere of an aging ""wonder boy"" while putting the characters through a weekend of surreal and hilarous misadventures. I've seen the movie twice and it holds up very well.
