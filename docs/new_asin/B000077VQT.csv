7974328,5,B000077VQT,"This is a comprehensive exercise in which repetitions are kept to a minimum so that it doesn't get boring. I purchased this DVD after wearing out several prior videos-- all right, I'm old, but exercises like this routine, along with the other The Method routines, keeps me in terrific shape. And that's why I'm taking time to write this review.",1356652800,,344,4.75
7974329,5,B000077VQT,"This is definitely one of the most advanced Pilates, yoga and ""precision firming"" type workouts I've yet to try. In fact, I doubt I could have done this workout six months ago. If you have been using some of The Method workouts or even have been trying any Pilates or yoga based workouts, this will still be a challenge. I'd start with Walk Away the Pounds and Winsor Pilates, then move on to some MTV Yoga DVDs and then try this workout after about six months of trying anything with Pilates or yoga that is less intense.

I say this because even after working out for years, this was pretty intense! There are balance moves which take muscle strength I didn't think I had. I even noticed one of the other ""I assume"" instructors got a bit shaky once.

The instructor is brilliant in the way she makes sure you know exactly what you are about to do at every ""moment."" For beginners, this would be way too fast. If you are intermediate or advanced, this will be a nice challenge. You have to first train your body to respond in seconds to this type of instruction. Marion Gotto is a master teacher and she will ""work your entire body"" big time! She is relentless and I loved it.

There are three precision toning workouts. Each is made up of the wonderful techniques and combination of movements that make The Method Workouts so classic. You will get to choose from three workouts or just start at the beginning and move through all of the workouts in 60 minutes. Need more of a challenge? Do a Walk Away the Pounds Two Mile Walk before starting this DVD.

So what are the three workouts?

Total Toning - You will be working out all your major muscle groups. You could use just this one section after walking on your treadmill. You start with head rolls, shoulder shrugs, forward bends and your arms get a nice full range of motion. This is a dancer-type routine. You will learn to balance, your feet will get an excellent workout and you will notice lots of Pilates-type moves like the roll-up, teaser. Then you move to some yoga moves while flat on your back and a cat stretch or two.

Upper Body Toning - The way you move on the floor feels like you are in a slow, beautiful dance with weights. The disciplined instruction is inspirational. You start standing, just lifting the weights and then you get more creative, you start using balancing moves while holding the weights. I loved the creative ""mermaid"" moves and also the incredible no-nonsense upper body workout. You will be making use of gravity in a big way. You never feel that you are doing a boring set of repetitions with weights. You feel like a dancer. Nice and creative.

Abdominal Toning - At this point, you are very happy to be flat on you back again. This segment will test your endurance, muscle control and balance. You can really feel all these exercises working. It took more concentration to complete this portion of the routine, but it was well worth it. Remember the teaser, well it takes on a new meaning here. Just wait and see! You will recognize pilates moves like ""saw, side kicks, single leg circles, leg lifts, pull-ups."" Can I say this reminded me of the phrase: ""no mercy."" Ok, but if you are looking for a challenge, this is IT.

Use this workout when you have so much energy you can't wait to find a challenging workout. Then, when you make it through this workout, you will know you have reached a place where you can really feel proud of yourself.

Intermediate to Advanced! Worth Your Time. You might want to take a day off after this routine. You will deserve it!
