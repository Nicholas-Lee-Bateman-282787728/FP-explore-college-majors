8429475,5,B004HE31AG,I'm a fan of Takeru Sato & I like most of his work. This is a goofy show to watch with just the right amount of drama added in. The only downside was the english subs kind of broke down towards the end of the series. Other than that I liked it.,1379289600,,244,3.7115384615384617

8429477,1,B004HE31AG,My daughter is an African American and obsessed with Asian culture. She watches Korean dramas faithful but she dislike this one. She couldn't get into the storyline and the subs made matters worse.,1339545600,,197,5.0
