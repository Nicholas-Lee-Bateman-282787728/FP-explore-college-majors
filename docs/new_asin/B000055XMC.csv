Brown uses his wits to fool the enemy in this film. You get what you expect from a Jim Brown film, fighting and a very beautiful woman to spice up the scenes. Brown fans will enjoy seeing their hero in another action movie. I enjoyed it. I wanted to see more fight scenes but the plot was well developed and kept my interest. I liked the fact that the African Americans and the Filipinos worked together. Overall this is an enjoyable action film with an unexpected conclusion.",1481328000,,622,4.5625

7931241,3,B000055XMC,"This is a low-budget blaxploitation flick, with very little of what you may come to expect of a blaxploitation movie. There were about two soul/funk songs, a brief encounter of racism and another brief encounter of a beautiful actress with very little sexual tension stirring.  For language buffs, Japanese is spoken as is a language of the Philippines, which may or may not be Tagalog.  I also recall a sentence or two in Spanish, though I may be mistaken. This version of the movie is very grainy, which adds to the already unappealing nature of the movie. This is not to say that this was a horrible flick, however don't get ready to see a good one either.  For 2.99 in a supermarket's DVD bin, I felt it worth the buy for nothing more than another blaxploitation movie added to my collection.  On a last note, there are two fun scenes worth mentioning. One where Jim Brown plays on his football days and catches, passes and runs with a bomb, the other, a surreal scene of deep water floating goat carcasses.",1204416000,3,1011,4.569060773480663
7931242,2,B000055XMC,"This movie  about World War 2 in the Pacific was made in 1979 but did not see the light of day until a video release in the mid 1980's .Jim Brown -who also co-produced the picture -plays Clyde Preston a US Navy diver compelled by the conquering Japanese to lead a team of largely US divers in diving in Manila Bay to recover the consignment of silver dumped there by MacArthur to ensure it did not fall into Japanese hands .The team includes Zoe (Tim Brown),the composed and astute Dealer (Richard Jaeckel) and the argumentative Dennis (Rik Van Nutter).Aided by the local Filipino resistance they set out to delay and sabotage the project ,a key role being played by atractive and feisty Tita (Dindo Fernandez)of the resistance .The Japanese lose patience and call in the big cheese to sort things out.
Jaeckel apart this is poorly acted and the direction is soporific. The use of anachronistic songs on the soundtrack is also an irritant especially that bombastic sloganeering pile of musical pigeon poop Edwin Starr's ""War""( A desperate bid for ""relevance""perhaps.?)
Action scenes are poorly staged and the one plus point is the location shooting in the Philippines .The scenery is splendid but unfortunately some rather poor actors spend too much time standing in front of it and obscuring the view

Best avoided unless you are a Pacific war completist in which case it has curiosity appeal",1204243200,2,1393,4.8734177215189876
