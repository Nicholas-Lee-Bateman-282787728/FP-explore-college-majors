5851480,5,B00DRQETNI,"5 Stars As No One Else Did This,Madacy is not the greatest reproducer of some of the great classics that we recalled,but in this instance I must give them a thumbs up as gathering all of the shorts is a saving feature for so many buyers as they can have them all in one set. As far as the sound and video you must remember I don't think it was that great in its original showing,and when I was little the stations that were running them showed them this way also. I defiately like the fact that you can view only the cartoon shorts or just the intros by the stooges,that something they could have not done but did. Also the cd,s that came with this with Christmas songs alone cost 11.99 so your getting this set for like free if you were going to buy the christmas cd now you don't have to. I think when people want cleaned up dvd,s they forget how time consuming and ill cost effective this process is,and would certainly cost much more that what is being asked for on here,plus satisfaction is always number one for Amazon,if your not happy then send it back,Amazon has always backed there items up and thats why I shop here,thats minus the new state tax law I would have liked to seen them fight that more aggressively but you cant have everything.",1386374400,8,1251,4.327659574468085
5851481,4,B00DRQETNI,"It says on the back box these cartoons were introduced in 1969...LOL....right there sums up the quality and time put on this set!
Glad to have the ""complete cartoon"" series with the live actions scenes but the ""public domain"" quality of the prints is a joke! Anyone with the prints transferred to their PC could have rendered a better job than whats on these DVD's!",1385251200,,365,4.630769230769231
5851482,5,B00DRQETNI,Not the best picture quality but the sound is very good this looks lockets has been transferred from vHS but  at least you get the butter most get all the episodes that's the good,1383523200,,179,4.264705882352941
5851483,5,B00DRQETNI,THE THREE STOOGES ARE SO FUNNY.  ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THEM IS A PLUS IN MY MIND. THEY ARE SO FUNNY,1383264000,,106,3.608695652173913
5851484,2,B00DRQETNI,"I'm a fan of the ""Curly-Joe"" era Stooges (a time when they made a massive comeback as kiddie entertainers), and these cartoons have a quirky, nostalgic appeal that capture the Stooges at, arguably, their peak of popularity, if not their prime, comedy-wise. In the scope of their 40 year film & TV career, these cartoons are often seen as an embarrassment; nowhere near classic two-reelers with Curly & Shemp -- or even Joe Besser. Sharp, brilliant prints of the complete run of cartoons could have gone a long way to rehabilitate their reputation.

Opportunity lost.

First and foremost, it's obvious that Comedy III, the owners of the Three Stooges trademark and the licensor of these cartoons, put absolutely zero effort into this set. I had given up complaining about DVD releases a long time ago (you'll never please everyone), but the only thing the new Complete Collection has going for it is that, yes, it's complete. But quality-wise, it's consistently sub-par -- generally somewhat better than most public domain dollar discs, but not by a lot. Rumour is that Comedy III resorted to nearly-30 year old masters produced for VHS release; it's hard to believe otherwise. Nothing here can compare with the crisp & colourful, original Rhino DVD releases from a few years ago, ""digitally transferred from the original 16mm films"". Prints on this set are universally washed out, soft and fuzzy.

It's a shame, because there was the potential to have a really excellent set here. No matter what you think about the cartoons, they are part of the Stooges legacy and deserve better. And here's where Comedy III really dropped that ball - they ""OWN"" the names & likenesses of the Stooges, yet do them a terrible disservice whenever they're connected to any sort of DVD release (the previous collector's tins, for example). If they cared at all, they would have partnered with somebody like Legend Films, who at least SEEMS to try to get the best quality material possible, and goes the extra effort to present it well.

Comedy III, if you own the Three Stooges, why insult them like this?",1383004800,33,2086,4.8841807909604515
5851485,4,B00DRQETNI,"Good news this is the complete set as you remember seeing on TV that includes the live skits in between the animation.
Bad news the audio fluctuates from scene to scene. The opening theme song clip is loud. Then the live skits are low and the animation is a little louder than the skits but lower than the opening theme song. So you might have to find a happy medium for volume.
It looks like they didn't clean up the footage just recorded as is. But this is rare to have and pretty sure no one else is going through the trouble of putting it together.
No bonus stuff other than 2 CDs of Three Stooges singing children & Christmas songs.
Added option you can view all the animation w/out the live skits or view the live skits w/ out the animation. I like to view them as I originally did on tv w/ usually Moe introducing the next cartoon. So if you are a Stooges fan like myself I think you'll enjoy it w/ some of the defects.
This would of been 5 stars if the volume was the same level and would of been 3 stars if it wasn't The Three Stooges.",1382313600,13,1044,4.122549019607843
5851486,5,B00DRQETNI,"After years and years of random sets of various random episodes.

FINALLY! A Complete Collection of this Cartoon Treasure.

I always found this cartoon along with the live action segments to be a real Nostalgic Treasure.

My only fear is that the release date is more than 3 months away and no guarantees the company will even be around by then!

Here's to keeping my fingers crossed.........",1373155200,10,392,4.8059701492537314
5851487,3,B00DRQETNI,"I recently ordered this as a way to complete my collection of Stooges material.  Of course there's no way to compare these cartoons to the original Three Stooges episodes, since the audience they appeal to is much different.  The best thing about the collection is that it's complete without anything missing.  I was disappointed to find just how low the picture quality is - I know these cartoons were made long before CGI and HDTV, but the picture looks like it came from an old videotape (probably due to the fact that they compressed the material - The run time is long enough to fill 5 DVD's, but they decided to use only 4 instead).  I doubt you would find another complete collection of Stooges cartoons - They're pretty much ignored in most box sets, and most Stooges box sets aren't worth the material they're made of (as you'll find when reading reviews, and as I found out the hard way a number of years ago), so if you want the cartoons this is the item to buy.",1436140800,,973,4.449438202247191

5851492,5,B00DRQETNI,"This cartoon is very funny. I have ALWAYS been a huge fan of The Three Stooges. I first saw this cartoon when I was a kid. I had it on video cassette and it had three random episodes. It was the first time that I've seen the Stooges in color. Then, one day I got a Three Stooges DVD with three random shorts and three random cartoons of this show. I also watched several episodes on YouTube. It's nice that they have FINALLY released this on DVD. Not only is this a funny collection, it also features the real Stooges beginning and ending each cartoon and providing the voices as well. They were getting old at this stage but they could still make people laugh. Most of the episodes reminds me of the original Stooge shorts. I'm not really fond of Curly Joe because he wasn't as funny as Curly and Shemp.",1417392000,,804,4.296052631578948

5851497,3,B00DRQETNI,"THE NEW THREE STOOGES-COMPLETE CARTOON COLLECTION: Endlessly released, reissued and regurgitated during the DVD age, this animated version of every red blooded male's favorite numbskulls obviously can't compare to the original Colombia shorts with CURLY and SHEMP...or for that matter, not even the final full length flicks made with CURLY JOE DERITA. Although each five minute cartoon boasts MOE, LARRY and CURLY JOE's original voices (as opposed to the lame brained characterizations of the later ROBONIC STOOGES) and color live action wraparound segments, the storylines and animation are pretty pedestrian. The questionable quality of these prints goes with the territory of all public domain material, but at least this massive set includes all 156 toons in the series (although only 40 live intros were filmed) and a bonus cd of THE THREE STOOGES NONSENSE SONGBOOK and some cracked Christmas carols. Those extras alone will be enough to entice many die hard STOOGE-aholics...you know who you are. Nyuk-nyuk.

5851504,3,B00DRQETNI,"I remember watching these cartoons in the mid to late 1960's mornings on WLS-TV in Chicago. There would be two episodes of The New Three Stooges mixed with two episodes of Roger Ramjet. I hadn't seen these cartoons since then except on a couple of five or six episode vhs collections. Could the quality of this release been better? Absolutely! As has been reported on here before Image/Madacy obviously did not have access to the original prints. There are plenty of signs of these being video tape transfers. I have also noticed the music on the ending credits does not conclude correctly. What this set does have going for it is that it is the complete collection and the colors are generally very vibrant and not faded at all. The bonus cd is also a nice little piece of nostalgia. Don't get me wrong, I really have enjoyed watching these cartoons again but I just couldn't give the set a five star rating because of the flaws. If you want all of the cartoons in one set I think this is the only place you will see them.",1388275200,3,1023,4.446808510638298

8596815,3,B00DRQETNI,"These old cartoons were never very good and the live action intros and exits were only a bit better. Everything is there, but these are not really restorations, just transferred prints from the mid 1960's and they are showing their age, with the live action bits suffering most; blurry images, fluctuating audio, etc. Still, if you are one of those folks who need to have everything the Stooges ever did, this is the complete cartoon collection, so you'll have to pony up and buy it.",1482105600,,483,4.694117647058824

8596817,4,B00DRQETNI,"""Hello, hello, hello! Hello."" You get all 156 of the New 3 Stooges cartoons with the 40 live-action wraparounds in this collection, though some sources say there were 41 wraparounds, with #41 never being in here, in this 5-disc collection, which includes a music CD of Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe singing their popular takes on classic songs, even for Christmas, in the same CD! The 4 DVDs have 39 shorts apiece, with the options of having the whole shorts played, or just the animated segments, all in LP mode to handle that many shorts to a disc! All 156 shorts are old, unrestored prints; what do you expect from independent companies like Image/Madacy Entertainment, who specialize in Public Domain stuff on home video? This set even has shorts that aren't in the Public Domain, causing this to be a complete set! Believe it or not, my first exposure to the Stooges was their last cartoon (in numerical order), DinoPoodi, over 20 years ago in a Public Domain videotape! I wish the set had better packaging than the wooden one with flimsy hubs to hold the discs in place; luckily I had a normal-size DVD case that holds 6 at once, that doesn't stack 'em like Pringles chips, to hold them all, with room for one more! Even with their original lackluster packaging, all 5 discs play just fine, all the way through! Better to have the whole series, than nothing at all, if you grew up watching this lesser-known Stooge series on Public Domain videotapes or DVDs, that way they'll go great with Mill Creek's Stoogian 6-Movie Collection, and especially all 9 volume sets of The Three Stooges Collection by Columbia and Sony, counting the black rarities volume! You Knuckleheads will get a bang (on the head) outta this collection, remembering familiar shorts from Public Domain releases, along with shorts you've never seen before, since they aren't in the Public Domain!
