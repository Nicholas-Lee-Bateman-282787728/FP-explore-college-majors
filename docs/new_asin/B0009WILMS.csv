8068715,2,B0009WILMS,"This is the same Dave and Matt we love in Little Britain.  BUT, they had not yet hit their comedic stride in this Rock Profile series.  You can see glimmers of their future funniness in the mock rock interviews, but most fall pretty flat.",1428278400,,238,4.386363636363637
8068716,1,B0009WILMS,Thank god I only paid $3.00. On the first disc Matt and David do an intro and say this was before we were funny. It sure isn't.,1418688000,,127,3.740740740740741
8068717,3,B0009WILMS,"I like Little Britain and typically love the projects that Walliams and Lucas are involved with but I've watched a few of these short parodies and neither my wife nor I found them to be particularly funny. Perhaps part of the reason is that some of the humor is now dated, and some of the celebrities they lampoon would have only been known to audiences in the UK.",1384560000,,364,4.367647058823529
8068718,5,B0009WILMS,I think this is a fabulous dvd and would highly reccomend it to anyone that enjoys a good laugh. I thought it was quite funny david walliams and matt lucas are 2 very funny men. I would highly reccomend this to anyone that has a sense of humour and loved little britain.,1311984000,,270,4.211538461538462
