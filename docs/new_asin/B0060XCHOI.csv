Might watch it again after she passes her exam :)  To the right!",1321488000,2,157,4.2
4924178,5,B0060XCHOI,"I'm a grandma who has survived raising two teenage drivers. I do feel that purely using drivers ed training is not enough. I purchased the ""Roadworthy"" DVD for the families of both my kids since they have their own teen drivers coming up now or already driving. I've made them promise to watch the video together as a family before the young driver touches the keys. And yes, I watched it too, and even though I'm now 71 years old and have taken the AARP driving class every three years, I still learned a lot! I was never taught many of the safety tips in this video.  Please, parents, know how important it is to be involved in this process of your child driving!",1320364800,7,665,4.362903225806452
4924179,5,B0060XCHOI,"Hey, I'm glad to see this product on Amazon now! I watched this DVD while my twins were learning to drive. It is excellent. There's great information that helped me know exactly what to do, and reduced the stress of the experience for all of us. Having a teen driver is intimidating, but our family had a much better time than my neighbors going through this stage because we watched ""Roadworthy."" I even learned some things that helped me be a better driver, too, which was a bonus I wasn't expecting.",1319846400,4,502,4.527472527472527
8490710,5,B0060XCHOI,"Roadworthy: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Teens to Drive is a great DVD for both parents and students. Handing over the car keys to your teen driver is a bit nerve-wracking. With driving comes huge responsibility. This DVD provides great reminders as your teen driver takes to the road. As part of the 10th Grade Timberdoodle Curriculum Kit for 2016 your student will greatly benefit from this STEM instructional tool.

There are 14 sections included on the DVD:

Fine Tune the Basics
The First Road Trip
Head Out on the Freeway

Distracted Driving - Surviving the ""new drunk driver""
EXTRAS!
As a parent of 6 children, two of which are already driving, I was excited to get the opportunity to review this DVD. Our third child, and only son, is 15 years old. I would be lying to say that I am not a bit anxious about putting him behind the wheel. Like his older siblings, when he turned 15, he started working on the requirements to obtain a learners permit. We want to provide our son with as many months behind the wheel as possible before he turns 16 and gets his official license. Roadworthy has been a great tool and resource. In a nutshell, Roadworthy is a defensive driving DVD.

Mike Pehl is a veteran Accident Investigator, and Driver's Safety Expert. With this DVD he hopes to give parents and young drivers practical tips and advice that will last a lifetime. Did you know that 1 out of 2 teens crash in the first 6 months of driving. This statistic has remained the same for the past 50 years. Most states require only 30 hours of drive time before getting a license. The whole DVD in its entirety is only a bit over 1 hour in length.

Mike talks about the importance of choosing the best instructor. Teaching a teenager to drive requires someone who can remain calm and collected. I know that I am NOT the one to best instruct my child behind the wheel. I am extremely too nervous and uptight sitting next to a newbie driver and am definitely more of a detriment than an asset.

I love the practical tips that Mike gives throughout the DVD lessons. From the ""4 point checklist"" to real world driving, Mike drives home the basics without lecturing or being too wordy. Each lesson is about 5 minutes in length.

I learned some new things too! I, like most adults learned the 10 & 2 rule when learning to drive. Well, did you know that because of airbags that rule is no longer recommended. So where are you supposed to place your hands on the wheel now? Hand placement is now either 9 & 3 or 8 & 4.

Some helpful hints that will be covered in more detail are:
Why Saturday and Sunday are great days for practice driving
importance of adding distractions to the mix
great tips for nailing parallel parking and 90 degree back in's

The section entitled, Distracted Driving is the ""New Drunk Driver"" was definitely an eye opener. I am sure that it is not surprising to anyone that cell phones are becoming the #1 killing machine. The time that it takes a distracted driver to look at their phone is approximately 5 seconds which equals the length of time it would take to cross the length of a football field. It is not only phones that distract drivers from their #1 priority which is SAFE DRIVING! Eating, the radio, passengers, applying make-up, shaving, and the list goes on. As a driver it is your responsibility to keep the roads safe for everyone.

The timing of my son learning to drive and watching this DVD was perfect. My son just earned his learner's permit!! Yikes, talk about exciting and scary all at once. My husband took my son out to the car for the first time with my son behind the wheel. My son's first experience behind the wheel consisted of talking, explaining everything on the dashboard, and turning the car on to try everything out.

My son said, ""Thank you Mike Pehl for this very informative DVD. You covered so much in only an hour. I am glad that my mom had me watch this.""

We inherited my husband's, grandmother's Buick years ago. It may look like a granny car but it is a great car for learning how to drive. So far two older sibling have learned with it and now it's my son's turn.

Thank you, Mike Pehl for making this DVD for parents and young drivers. I learned a great deal of information and appreciate the advice you gave. I definitely feel more confident with my son getting behind the wheel after we watched your DVD.

I would highly recommend this DVD to all parents of soon to be driver's, as well as current driver's. By taking 1 hour out of your day or week to watch this DVD will make a difference. I encourage you to talk with your child after watching each episode or at least after watching it in its entirety.",1470960000,,4929,4.476614699331849

8490712,1,B0060XCHOI,"I purchased this DVD based solely on the 5 star reviews, and now that I am writing a review, I noticed that none of those reviews I read are from verifiable amazon purchases, so I really got duped. The prior reviews are a farce.
I also thought I could resell the DVD on amazon but listing this for sale is restricted.
As for the DVD, it was not helpful, it was too short, and way over-priced.
There were MANY things in this video that were WRONG according to California state law, so apparently this DVD  only applies to the state in which it was made and I don't know what state that is.
I had to continually pause this to correct misleading information with my son.
For example, the guy says to make sure your high school friends put their seat belts on while riding with you for liability reasons. However, in California, it is illegal for a teen driver with a provisional license to transport other teens from school, whether they have a seat belt on or not.
The guy in the video also does not differentiate between driving an automatic or a stick-shift in any of the examples.
The guy says that in an emergency the parent needs to turn the ignition off to stop the vehicle, but does not elaborate on this.  He does not explain what will happen when the power steering goes out as a result. There was no video of a vehicle doing this.
The video does not cover 4-way stops AT ALL.  There are no examples of incorrect and correct passing, he just talks.  Some people are visual learners and want to see what he is talking about (that's why we ordered a DVD)  but he just talks.
I could go on about specific issues, but the point is, it was a waste of money for us.
This is a real, verifiable amazon purchase!",1438300800,16,1710,4.314641744548287

8490716,5,B0060XCHOI,"""Roadworthy: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Teens to Drive"" is an essential video for those who have taken on the important role of teaching a beginning driver the fundamentals of safe driving.  Perhaps you have been crash free, citation free, and believe you are a skilled driver.  However, do you think you may have developed some short cuts and unsafe practices that you would not like to pass on to a new driver?  For example, when approaching a stop sign do you really fully stop your vehicle or just slow down if the path of travel is clear?  Do you even realize that you may be rolling through a stop sign, which is illegal?

I have been a public school Driver Education instructor in a large metropolitan area for over 25 years.  When I first viewed this video, I learned new procedures; assured myself that I was practicing some safe driving techniques, but realized I needed to refresh other driving practices where I had developed bad habits.

""Roadworthy: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Teens to Drive"",  along with the web site, will define what skills and procedures need to be taught to a new driver along with refreshing the skills of the instructing adult driver.  The video shows a new driver experiencing instruction on the road, in traffic, and driving through situations where instruction is needed.  Mike Pehl is an experienced crash investigator with experience in driver education instruction.

This is an instructional video that I use in my Driver Education classroom and I provide information for those who would find it beneficial to purchase their own copy to review the safe driving practices before being licensed as well as a future skill  refresher so unsafe driving practices do not develop through experience.

I know this video will be a learning experience for the beginning driver as well as the parent or adult instructor.",1415750400,,1857,4.875796178343949
8490717,5,B0060XCHOI,"Excellent INFORMATION. Now if our teen would only stop playing the music soooo loud as he is driving on his own. We tell him it is a distraction! Any suggestions on this?

Please continue to produce more DVD's to help save the lives of new drivers and teens.
We are seriously considering the Smith driving course for our teen as my husband is required by his employer to take these tests.
Thank you for all you do in keeping us all safe. :^)

8490718,5,B0060XCHOI,"I have twins that are 15 and just got thier permits.  I started trying to teach them to drive and it was not going well.  An old neighbor loaned me this video, and I've should have watched this before they kids started driving.  I learned about all the mistake I was making and have things going in a better direction at this point.
I would highly recommend that all parents and new drivers watch the video and use it as a place to start with your kids.",1410912000,2,453,4.183908045977011

This video really helped me set the ground rules with her and this teaching moment ended up being a good experience for both of us.  I am happy to say that she has been driving for almost a year now by herself and no tickets and no accidents!  She is a confidant driver!,1323302400,4,423,4.185185185185185
