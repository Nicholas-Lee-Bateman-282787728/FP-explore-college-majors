I'm so glad I have it.  Been enjoying every minute of it.  If you like humor, heart, drama, you're in for a treat.",1410220800,,279,4.074074074074074

8430085,5,B004I4W9Q2,"I originally saw this k-drama on mysoju.com I started watching this drama mainly because of the actress Kim Ah Joong. All of the movies (200 pounds beauty) and dramas I have seen her in so far have been really good. This has been no exception. After watching this drama, I have to say that this is one of my favourite Korean Dramas of all time next to Soulmate. Not only is the story great but also the music featured in the drama as well. I don't think anyone who purchase this will be disappointed especially if you're a fan of k-dramas or just Asian dramas in general. This drama has a little bit of everything sprinkled through out. Hope this was helpful^_^",1334275200,2,661,4.426229508196721
8430086,4,B004I4W9Q2,"I don't like personally Korean drama, But this one is good.
The main actor and the main actress are wonderful.
Except the Kiss, that I call korean kiss compare to french kiss, because it s so fake.

The drama is well done, the music is well chosen and there are some funny moment.
