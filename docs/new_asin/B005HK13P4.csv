4701932,5,B005HK13P4,"I can definitely rate this movie as a 5 because of the cast - most them became or already were great actors in their own right. As Sidney Lumet's directorial debut in a movie, it is a must for any serious movie collector. However, it is not a 5 because of the blu-ray, which is disappointing only if you forget how old this movie is and how small a budget Henry Fonda had to produce it. I show this movie in a college class to demonstrate the stages groups go through. It is surprising how many (who have never seen it, of course) fall in love with it, recommend it to their friends and want to own it. Besides the clear cut ways in which the group behaves, the themes of prejudice and ageism are dramatically portrayed in ways that generate a good deal of discussion. The supplemental features are interesting. I have been on two juries and neither were as emotionally charged as 12 Angry Men. However, neither jury would have made a good movie. Highly recommended.",1323216000,,966,4.432584269662922
4701933,5,B005HK13P4,"This is the fifth release by Criterion of middle to late Fifties Black & White films released under the United Artists film company in the last few years, along with ""Kiss Me Deadly"" & ""Night of the Hunter""(both from 1955), ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Sweet Smell of Success""(both from 1957). Like the latter two, ""12 Angry Men"" was released to excellent reviews in 1957 but disappointing box office and was eventually withdrawn from release by United Artists after only two weeks. It was the first film directed by Sidney Lumet, one of the greatest directors in American cinema. Lumet(who died this past April) was an ""actor's director"" and in his long career actors who appeared in his films received 17 Oscar nominations with four of them actually winning. Lumet's record in this regard is only matched by William Wyler who directed actors appearing in his films to an astonishing 36 Oscar nominations with 14 wins. Although none of the actors in ""12 Angry Men"" received a nomination for their fine work, the film showcases some of the best acting you are likely to ever see in a film from this time period. Films today seem to have lost that. It's all about special effects, vampires, and big budgets. These recent Criterion releases show how you can do more with less as many of these films were made on small budgets. ""12 Angry Men"" was made for under $400,000. The film holds up extremely well considering it's over fifty years old. However, if it were made today there would be more diversity in the jury room. It also holds up well because Americans still love sensational courtroom trials. And when the juries come back with verdicts that they don't agree with, such as the recent ""Not Guilty"" verdicts in the Casey Anthony, actor Robert Blake, O.J. Simpson and Rodney King trials, all you hear for days is ""What were they thinking?"". Well, Lumet takes us into those jury deliberations with ""12 Angry Men"" and it's an eye-opener from the very beginning. Almost everyone knows the plot of the film so I won't go into that. Let's just say that I'm sure they still show this film in law schools around the country. Criterion has done it's usual outstanding production. The film is transfered from a 35 mm fine-grain master positive which is completely free of lines, dirt, scratches, etc. The film looks gritty due it's choice of film stock by the cameraman Boris Kaufman, but you can still see the small details. The inside of the Jury Room is hot and you can see and feel the beads of sweat on each of the actor's faces. Except for Henry Fonda, most of the actors were just starting out in film and several(Martin Balsam and Ed Begley) went on to win Oscars. Lumet always rehearsed his actors for two weeks before he started shooting and he had the great gift of listening to them about any concerns they had about their characters or the direction they should go in understanding that character. He made his best(and more commercial) films in the Seventies with: ""Serpico""(1973), ""Murder on the Orient Express""(1974), ""Dog Day Afternoon""(1975) and ""Network""(1976) but he returned to the courtroom often as with ""The Verdict""(1982). Criterion's Blu-ray of Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" should be essential to any film collector's library.",1322524800,,3241,4.799642218246869
4701950,5,B005HK13P4,"12 Angry Men is a film thats so good and so powerful that, as the credits roll, you actually feel like youve gained a deeper understanding of humanity, our justice system, and life in general. I mean it. Its really that good.

Twelve jurors of varying ages, personalities, cultural backgrounds and social standings enter a deliberation room to determine the guilt or innocence of a troubled teenage boy accused of murdering his father. Its quite a simple premise  a jurys deliberation  one that occurs daily all over the United States. But the film manages to wring every last drop of tension, drama, and social commentary from this commonplace scenario that its impossible not to viscerally experience the true weight and implications of such a task  to search for the truth in a case of life and death.

First things first: lets just appreciate how entertaining 12 Angry Men is. This is a film that takes place entirely in a single room, and tells its story completely through dialogue. And yet, it manages to be significantly more absorbing and enthralling than your average film with dozens of different locations and set pieces. The dialogue is so well-written and the characters so well-realized (and acted) that you become completely swept up in the proceedings. The pacing is also pitch perfect. The film rises naturally to a few emotional climaxes and confrontations, which are punctuated by quieter moments as the characters (and we as the audience) catch our breaths and process what has developed. And for a film that takes place entirely in such a confined space, there are a pretty incredible number of interestingly-composed sequences and long takes as the camera maneuvers from character to character and the drama unfolds.

So yes, 12 Angry Men is a superbly entertaining film that absolutely flies by over the course of its brief hour-and-a-half running time. But its also so much more than that. Its a film about truth: its elusiveness, malleability, and vulnerability to the subjectivity of the human mind. Yes, there is a single objective truth to this, and likewise any real-life case; but the jurors don't know it, and neither do we. The objective truth isn't the point. The point is the impressionability of the truth  how it morphs in the minds of the characters (and in ours) over the course of the film, and how significantly it can be informed by our emotions, past experiences, memory (and its limitations), prejudices, and a myriad of other factors. The film is able to crystallize both the beauty and the folly of our judicial system. The beauty, as Henry Fondas character points out, is that the scales are heavily tipped in favor of the innocent, that no man can be found guilty unless that guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt. The folly? The subjectivity of reasonable doubt, and the unavoidable reliance on a human jury who are influenced by all of the aforementioned factors.

But ultimately, 12 Angry Man a film about us  people. Each juror in the film has a unique personality, temperament, and background which informs his opinion and motivates the role he plays in the story. Every juror gets his time to shine and the result is an ensemble that feels both diverse and extremely well-balanced.

The strength of the characters in the film and the way they play off of one another is key to perhaps its most important theme: the danger of assumption, and the ease and quickness with which we judge one another. We watch as the jurors expose their biases and prejudices through their assumptions and judgments of the defendant, as well as one another. But even beyond that, the true brilliance of the film is that it subtly provokes the exact same snap-judgments from us as we watch. Its extremely easy to start to view the more critical jurors as the good guys and the dissenting, guilty-proponent jurors as the bad guys. To invoke a psychiatric concept, we engage in splitting  seeing some of the jurors as all good and others as all bad. We automatically begin to judge the seemingly more prejudiced and willful jurors, confining them to a box of our construction without knowing barely anything about them.

But in its revealing final moments, the film snaps us back and urges us to look beneath the surface of those who we judge and ask an important question: why? Why does one juror spew prejudice and anger while another sits silently? What drives them to act in the way that they do? No one is born prejudiced, bigoted or racist. These are things we learn and which become incorporated into our personalities often through no fault of our own. The angry, prejudiced juror isn't inherently all bad, but simply reacts in a way that is informed by his accumulated life experience (much of which is subconscious). Of course, that doesnt mean that people cant and shouldnt be held accountable for their negative attributes and beliefs  we can always introspect and take action to improve our worst qualities. But that isn't the point. The film simply asserts that we should strive to understand before we judge, as understanding and empathy fosters connection where judgment simply divides. As Juror #3  who weve likely judged and grown to despise throughout the film  weeps over the torn photograph of himself and his estranged son at the conclusion of the film, the message couldn't be clearer.

12 Angry Men is a masterpiece. It is a film that marvelously succeeds on all the facets that every great film should. Its fabulously entertaining and engrossing, fantastically shot and acted, perfectly paced, and extremely thought-provoking. An undeniable classic whose themes will never lose their relevance.",1463443200,6,5648,4.917016806722689

4701974,5,B005HK13P4,"This is a review of this amazing classic that I just watched for the first time. My husband owned this so it doesn't show that it's purchased here, but alas, I had to review it as it is now one of the very best movies I've seen.

They don't make movies like this anymore - all dialogue, character, context, conversation, and exploring the inner human conflict when faced with a hard situation. The actors were brilliant - every single one of them - and even though I was a woman, I related to every single one - the old, the bitter, the neglected, the one that grew up in the slums, the one that just wanted to go to the ball game - and I loved watching the transformation on each character through the process of asking questions. What a great responsibility to decide the faith of another human being with your own judgement call, and what a great lesson to slow down and to ask more questions and to explore other interpretations of evidence.

Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It is one of the most gripping dramas I've had the fortune of watching. Now, if only there were a book on it ... I'll have to get my hands on the script. Brilliant film.",1425600000,,1158,4.307339449541284
4701975,5,B005HK13P4,"Needless to say, with this cast, the acting is second to none. The actors and the script kept me captivated for the full 96 minutes of the movie. It was only after watching it did it dawn on me where the real genius of this movie lie and that's with director Sidney Lumet. I feel this way about the movie because I realize that the entire film is shot within the confines of a jury room. The whole thing is one single set and only a great director can create such a huge classic with, aside from the cast, so little.

This is a must see (or must own) for any movie buff/historian.",1425513600,,580,4.132743362831858
4701976,5,B005HK13P4,"An absolutely one of a kind movie.  There have been many movies, of course, involving law trials, but to the best of my knowledge, this is the only one where we get to see jurors deliberating behind close doors.  Having served on many juries myself, I can say that a lot of what goes on in this film is accurate as far as everyone initially being set in his or her opinion and determined that no one is going to change their minds.  (Although in my experience, no one DOES change his or her mind.  Most of the juries I've served on have wound up hung.)  Henry Fonda gives one of his best performances as a gentle persuader--in contrast to the raving mentalities of some of the other members, especially Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb.  Great performances all around, and a great movie.",1425168000,,780,4.381944444444445

Great case study.",1424044800,,72,4.538461538461538
4701978,5,B005HK13P4,"One of the finest studies of human nature ever put on film. The script is terrific and the direction is top notch. Sidney Lumet doesn't waste a single frame; every shot informs, adding to the experience and wasting nothing. The story itself is as timely today as it was back in 1955. The actors are all wonderful, from big-caliber stars like Henry Fonda, down to bit part character actors like Robert Webber. Everybody is terrific and gets his chance to shine. The film doesn't even feel like a movie most of the time. It's more like you're a courtroom employee sitting in the jury room with these guys, silently watching the proceedings. The dialogue feels authentic, not stilted or stagey, and the actors all completely inhabit their roles; none of the performances seem phoney or forced. You forget you're watching movie stars (and stars in the making) and become completely mesmerized by the simple yet absorbing story, and the unfolding, ever-increasing tension that continues to mount with each passing minute.

As expected, the Criterion edition Blu-ray for 12 ANGRY MEN does not disappoint. The uncompressed, hi-def transfer looks stunning; a razor sharp picture with solid blacks, strong mid-tones and no artifacting or pixelation. The sound is clear as a bell. The picture & sound look to have been cleaned up but thankfully do not suffer from an overuse of DNR (digital noise reduction). The grain & detail are all there. You can count every bead of sweat that drips down each man's face. There are several bonus features to go along with the movie that make it even more of a value. All in all a great deal, especially if you buy a used copy, like I did.

I've watched this movie I don't know how many times in my life. This is one of those films that I can watch over & over and never tire of, like THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. You spot something new with each repeat viewing. And if you love movies like I do, then it's just a joy to sit back and watch some of the greatest actors who ever lived doing what they did best. If you have the film on DVD and are contemplating an upgrade, this is an easy recommendation. If you own a Blu-ray player but don't own this, or for some reason you have never seen it - then what in the world are you waiting for?!? Dramas simply don't get much better than this. And a final bit of advice for younger folks... don't pre-judge this film because of how old it is. Great movies & great acting NEVER go out of style. If you want a stellar example of both, then this version of 12 ANGRY MEN is about as good as it gets. This film and THE VERDICT make for an awesome double feature of powerhouse courtroom tension & drama. 5 STARS!!!",1415836800,4,2676,4.515463917525773

4701998,5,B005HK13P4,This film should be required viewing for civics classes.  It deals with prejudice on so many levels and is done in a non- judgmental way.  It holds you spell bound like you are a fly on the wall.  This movie is more prevalent today than when it was made.  This is one of the best cast of actors assembled and they really did a great job.  Well worth the purchase price.  Buy it and you will always treasure it.  It is worth watching again and again.,1390608000,,449,4.151162790697675
4701999,5,B005HK13P4,"12 Angry Men is such a classic, and deservedly so, that to review the film itself seems like a silly waste of time. Suffice to say, despite taking place primarily in a single room (five rooms total, and the implied ""outside"" being an invisible sixth) with almost no action, very little physical contact between any of the primary characters, and spending the entire film not knowing the name of a single one (two are named at the very end), it's one of the most gripping works ever.

But the print! Like too many others, my first - and for years, only - experience with 12 Angry Men was either the half-wrecked print that would air on a lazy Saturday afternoon on one of the higher-numbered channels on the UHF dial, or worse, the well-abused VHS copy that we would occasionally view at school when a substitute teacher didn't quite have enough material to pad out the entire day's classes. Either way, many of the subtleties of building tension were lost. It's little things, like the visible beads of sweat on someone's brow, or hairs that slowly go more and more astray as the deliberation proceeds, or Henry Fonda's eyes that, in this Criterion edition, practically blaze with color in a black-and-white film. The audio is similarly crystal-clear, and I'm able to pick up background conversations that were unintelligible in the past, or street noises that quietly beckon a return to life outside the room.

It goes without saying that, if a Criterion edition of a movie you're interested in is available, you should pick it up over any other edition, and this is an excellent example of why. The attention to detail, the care taken in restoration to respect the original work, the quality of the overall presentation and the extra material that only add to your appreciation are all why. Well worth the price, whatever the price.",1388016000,,1834,4.764150943396227

4702004,5,B005HK13P4,"I'm not much of a movie person. Oh, I like a good movie, but there's a lot of chaff out there and I don't have time or patience to sift through it all. I'm a book person and I've seen many a movie badly botch some of my beloved books. Granted, this movie is not based upon book, but what can I say? I'm a mite gun shy.

 I'd heard plenty of times that this was a good movie over the years, but seeing it for the first time and then a second time and perhaps a third time, I'm still processing its sublime simplicity; 12 men in a jury room whose task it is to determine the fate of an 18 year-old boy/man from the slums who has been accused of murdering his father. There's an eye witness who saw him commit the murder along with a neighbor who saw him run away from the crime scene.  A seemingly open and shut case.

What astonished me the most is that if this movie were to be remade today, 99% of the dialog would be relevant and still fresh.  The attitudes towards those living in the ""slums"" vs. our modern term ""inner city"" or ghetto is still pretty much the same. The ""those people"" and ""you know how they are"" is even more prevalent today. As someone who lives in a community with a lot of poverty, I encounter, and confront them, often.

A stellar cast lead by Henry Fonda delivers superlative performances. Standing alone with his ""Not Guilty"" vote to face the hostility of his fellow jurors, Fonda doesn't blather or attack those that disagree with him. With his words, he holds the mirror up so they must face their own preconceived perceptions. Those perceptions begin to fall, one by one. A young Jack Klugman portrays a juror who grew up in the same neighborhood as the defendant, but managed to escape to become a respectable member of society and blend in well with the others on the jury. When his character stands up to the desparaging comments about people that share his same upbringing, their defense is ""They're not talking about YOU."" Oh so familiar.

4702006,5,B005HK13P4,"Getting through the holidays, and finally having a chance to sit down and catch up on some Criterion movies has proved to be an absolute treat. On the top of my list was Sidney Lumet's, 12 Angry Men. This, ladies and gentlemen, is minimalism at its very best. I am not at all surprised that this 1957 film was nominated for multiple Academy Awards. I am also not surprised that this cinematic masterpiece inspired modern day court dramas such as Law and Order and The Practice.

Because of the minimalist production, and despite the many accolades, I was doubtful as to whether this picture could hold my attention. I mean, no gunfights, no super heroes, or beautiful damsels in distress, no CGI, or Jack Nicholson telling us about not being able to handle the truth? How in the world would this film keep me interested for the full 96-minute duration? I will tell you how. Screenwriter Reginald Rose and director Sidney Lumet put on an absolute clinic. That's how. The writing is impeccable, and the acting is a timeless delight. There was never a dull moment, which is surprising since we never get to see a murder scenario played out, or the dramatics of a closing courtroom argument. What we did see were 12 angry men huddled around a table in the jurors room deciding the fate of a young man, on the hottest day in New York, with a fan on the fritz.

The acting was so persuasive that I found myself inspired by those jurors who took their civil duties seriously, placing moral responsibilities above all other happenings in their life at the time. The character development was very thorough as I found myself liking Henry Fonda's character, and disliking a few of the others. Lumet challenges the viewer on morality and social justice, and does it quite well. This movie, while made many years ago, will still stir moral emotions in today's viewer.

Overall, I consider this movie a cinematic masterpiece. For that reason, and combined with Criterion's work in the blu-ray transfer, 12 Angry Men receives Five Stars from me. This is a must see for those that appreciate great cinema with a quality blu-ray picture. Add it to your collection today!",1357948800,,2154,4.723404255319149
4702007,5,B005HK13P4,"Criterion has, as always, done it again.  A superb movie to begin with, Criterion created an unbelievable transfer, which was a joy to watch.  Hard to find ""current"" movies of this quality and substance.",1356825600,,203,4.9411764705882355
4702008,5,B005HK13P4,"Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever made.  Despite the fact that about 95% of the movie occurs within the confines of a jury deliberation room, the script is so well written and the acting so well executed that you find yourself glued to the screen.  The director's choice to film in black and white rather than color was perfect given the theme of the film--a murder trial in which they must decide the fate of an 18 year old young man accused of murdering his father.  Though 12 Angry Men did not perform well at the box office, it was praised by critics and nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

This Criterion Collection blu-ray offers us the best available edition of the film.  It has much more detail than the DVD.  You can now see the texture of fabric, wood grain, beads of sweat on the actors' foreheads, the pores on their skin, individual strands of hair, etc.  These were all muted on the lower definition DVD edition.  Also, various artifacts have been removed, such as specks of dirt, scratches, and the like.  The sound was improved signifcantly through a remastering process that removed extraneous noises like hisses and hums that had crept in over time.  All of these changes improve the viewing experience.

The transfer is not flawless, however.  There is considerable film grain--the most I have ever seen in a blu-ray.  There are also some lighting issues, where a few scenes are darker than normal or else have shadows on the faces of the men.  This may have been the way it was filmed, however, and not a problem with the blu-ray transfer.

This edition includes a number of bonus features: a television version; production history; various interviews; a teleplay directed by Lumet; the original trailer; and a booklet containing an essay by Thane Rosenbaum.

I highly recommend this movie, which is why I gave it five stars.  It is a ""must see.""  If I were only grading the blu-ray transfer, however, I would give it three stars.  It might be the best edition available, but there is still room for improvement.  Perhaps the studio will have it restored and digitally remastered someday.

Note: The aspect ratio is not 1.77:1 as advertised by Amazon, but rather 1.66:1.",1351728000,7,2244,4.746770025839793

I received well before the promised delivery date. One night sat and watched this movie and was completely blown away. Don't know why such movies are not made anymore, with all  ridiculous budget and special effects no movie in recent past as fulfilling as this gone. Great acting, wonderful camera work in restricted space and awesome dialogues. This movie is great example of how to make a wonderful movie if you have great acting and screen play. I already watched it twice and I bet I will see it again in a month. AQ/VQ is top notch and Criterion has done wonderful job in restoring this classic. Box is good and the booklet is very nice. Great movie, great transfer and if you are thinking of buying it, don't think further. Worth every penny !!!!!",1349568000,,895,4.49079754601227
4702010,5,B005HK13P4,"In some ways, watching 12 ANGRY MEN was a little like watching MAD MEN.  I felt I was in an alien world, in which 12 jurors (all men) would be escorted into a hot, humid, ugly room, with no working fan and no good ventilation (and not even drinking water provided)and yet they would mostly keep on their jackets and ties, smoke like chimneys and all carry handkerchiefs for wiping off their brows.  No matter their age or socio-economic status, they all look much the same...at least until we get to know them.  It was fascinating simply to watch this and compare to how a group of 12 jurors is likely to act today.

The movie is about how 1 juror (Henry Fonda) works to convince the other 11 jurors (all anxious to get home and move on with their lives) to think and consider their knee-jerk ""guilty"" votes.  The case against a young Puerto Rican boy accused of killing his father seems to be pretty open and shut.  But as Fonda picks away at each element of the case, we realize that perhaps the poor kid didn't have a lawyer who was even willing to put up a fight because the case seemingly begins to crumble.

Watching the other 11 jurors, one by one, begin to reconsider their reactions makes up the heart of this movie.  The very confined jury room makes the movie feel very stage-bound...yet it is that claustrophobic feeling that adds a great deal of tension.  These men have no room to really get away from each other, and as their shirts sweat through and their handkerchiefs get drenched, the room becomes a sweatbox fraught with anger and barely-hidden resentments and prejudices.

The film is fun because it is full of wonderful actors.  What a treat to see Jack Warden again...what a great character actor.  E.G. Marshall is great and restrained, while Ed Begley gives a wild, old-fashioned and effective performance.  Each of the 12 actors is given plenty of chances to shine.  Director Sidney Lumet (in his big-screen debut) lets his camera get in close on each man at one time or another (and with the lovely Blu-Ray, we see each grain of film and each pore on each face).  And best of all, what a great performance from the (I suspect) nearly forgotten Lee J. Cobb...the original Willy Loman.  His bitter, unhappy character is the foil for Fonda's cool juror.  His acting style might not quite work in a modern film...but in the '50s, the was showing everyone how it was done.  No one SEETHED better than Cobb.  It's been years since I've seen him in anything.  It was worth seeing this film just for him.

2 performances didn't really work for me.  Jack Klugman seemed needlessly weak and ineffectual, but it's kind of fun to see the pre-Oscar Madison actor with his gestures that would become SO familiar later.  And I have to admit that I don't care for Henry Fonda's performance.  Part of it is the writing...at one point, we're asked to believe that he took the time to shop of a switchblade, seeming just so he could shock his fellow jurors later.  It's a dramatic moment that rings false.  But Fonda plays his character with a calm that is often nearly creepy.  He barely acknowledges his fellow men, as though he feels smarter and somehow above them.  Just a couple of minor turns of the dials, and this character could easily have been believed as a serial killer.  More than any other character/actor in the film, his role is a TYPE and not a believable INDIVIDUAL.

12 ANGRY MEN is a fantastic period piece, a tense drama and a great showcase for some top actors of that era.  The script is literate, and for the most part, doesn't feel too dated.  Under no circumstances should a film buff, particularly of American films, miss this remarkable film.

The Criterion Blu-Ray is excellent.  Gorgeous black and white, and a really nice mono sound mix.  The extras (including the earlier TV version of 12 ANGRY MEN) and many insightful interviews, provide great context and insight into this important film.",1338076800,,3932,4.60863309352518
4702011,5,B005HK13P4,"This is not so much a review of the film ""12 Angry Men"" (1957), there are plenty of those available, as it is specifically of the Criterion Collection Blu-ray edition of that film.  Briefly ""12 Angry Men"" is a classic American film.  If you haven't seen it, you are really missing something. A perfect ensemble cast, exciting cinematography and spot on direction from Sydney Lumet.  And the Criterion Collection edition of this film is a sterling example of what they can do at their best. They take a classic film and with a rich supply of supplemental material situate that film within the context of its own time and within the history of film as a whole. There are individual documentaries on director Sidney Lumet, writer Reginald Rose and cinematographer Boris Kaufman which provide us with insight not only into the creation of this particular film but into the history each of them brought to this film and where they went afterward.  If there was one outstanding revelation for me among the supplemental material it was a recognition of the effect that the live television dramas of the 50s, with their small scale and emphasis on character and relationships, had on American cinema. Television has always been treated as the poor relation of cinema, mostly deservedly, but many of the live television dramas of the 1950s were clearly not deficient in any way and are perfectly capable of holding their own. This disc includes the original television version of ""12 Angry Men"" (directed by Franklin J. Schaffner in 1955) as well as an earlier Reginald Rose/Sidney Lumet collaboration ""Tragedy in a Temporary Town"" (1956), both of which are strong arguments for the excellence of live television drama in the 50s. I don't believe television would reach this kind of quality again until the rise of major cable channel films in the last 20 years which are blurring the boundaries between television and cinema in a way that is making them all but indistinguishable.  If you already have the ""12 Angry Men"" Collector's Edition DVD, don't toss it.  There are two fine documentaries on that disc which do not appear on the Criterion version.",1337990400,6,2145,4.895316804407713
4702012,5,B005HK13P4,"This is my favorite film and I've seen it over fifty times.  Today I watched the Blu-ray version for the first time and the detail is stunning.  Yes, it's grainy; showing more detail of the original print means allowing the grain to come through in high definition, unless you run it through noise reduction, which does more harm than good.  This grain is part of the atmosphere of the film, and I actually find it aesthetically pleasing.

When I saw the detail in Jack Warden's hat, I nearly flipped out. All the times I've watched the movie on DVD and I never saw this intricate, flashy design in his hat.  It fits his character perfectly, too: salesman, goofy, etc.  And there are details to be found all over the film that enrich the themes like that.

Also, if you're like me and had a full screen DVD (that was by far the easiest one to find, inexplicably), you can finally see the whole 1.66:1 aspect ratio, and this makes a big, big difference in the feel of the movie.

The clarity and aspect ratio of this Blu-ray make this, already an intimate film, all the more intimate.  If, like me, you've known and loved these characters for many viewings, you might be stunned at how much closer this version brings you to them.

I own some really beautiful Blu-rays (The Searchers, Hellboy II, The Incredibles, and True Grit[Coen Bros] are some of the visual stand-outs), but none of those upgrades to Blu-ray have impacted the feeling of the film for me as much as this one.

Oh, and the audio is nice.  I heard a couple lines I never quite understood before.",1331337600,22,1562,4.5
4702013,5,B005HK13P4,"Magnificently efficient, powerful filmmaking that tells a tale the size of the Chrysler building from the cramped confines of a small jury deliberation room. A modern rendition of the same source material might have expanded this to cover the trial, the repercussions, the media's reaction and a happy ending for each juror, which completely misses the point. The most vivid drama of almost any court case comes from the simple, nondescript table its jurors convene around to determine their verdict; everything else is just sideshow. Via a dozen tremendous performances from his cast, first-time director Sidney Lumet produces a dazzling showcase of dense character development, precise plot expansions, expert dramatic timing and meaningful underlying conclusions. I must have seen it a dozen times now and still it holds me in rapt attention from word one.",1330905600,,859,5.37037037037037
4702014,5,B005HK13P4,"12 Angry Men (1957)
Drama, 96 minutes
Directed by Sidney Lumet
Starring Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Martin Balsam

Sidney Lumet passed away in 2011, but he left us with 72 films, shorts or TV series. This was his first feature for the big screen and it's definitely among his best work.

For me, one of the signs of a good film is to take a subject in which I have no interest and hold my attention for the duration. The story takes place in one room, apart from a couple of minutes at the beginning and end of the film. It succeeds because of the strength of the dialogue and the acting ability of all involved.

After a very compact 96 minutes in which no scene is wasted, the credits roll. I'm left with the feeling that I have just seen something important. The film deals with racism and highlights the good and bad points of the American justice system. Henry Fonda leads a strong cast and every member has a significant role to play.

Lumet used a variety of camera angles to make the viewer feel like a member of the jury and it's easy to be drawn in. This is one of those rare stories where dialogue is actually exciting. It's really something that has the potential to be enjoyed by any audience.

The picture quality is grainy which is fine with me but may be an issue for some while the mono sound quality is good enough.  Also included is a 24-page booklet containing an essay on the film.  In addition to the great screenplay, what makes this film great is the wonderful cast of star-studded actors who all put in excellently convincing performances of their respective roles.  Each of the 12 jurors are angry at something - their lives, a bad break, perceived slights etc but can they come to terms with what is really responsible for their anger in time to prevent them from venting it on the innocent whose life is in their hands?

This Criterion release is probably the best version of this film out there and if you are looking to upgrade to blu ray this is a great opportunity to do so.

  The other day, while looking at the list of ""Top Rated Movies"" on the Internet Movie Database's website (IMDb), I was shocked to see that ""12 Angry Men"" was rated at number five on that list. Now, I wasn't shocked because it was rated that highly (no, in my not so humble opinion, it could even go a couple of notches higher)  I was shocked because a BLACK-AND-WHITE movie of this vintage (1957!) was rated this highly! If you look at IMDb's list, you will see that a LOT of the movies are of a relatively recent vintage (i.e.the movies are mostly from the 1990s and the 2000s)  which, I'm sure, is attributable to (what I guess is) the fairly young demographic of the website. What has all of this got to do with anything, you may ask? Well, let me tell you (and, thanks for asking): the fact that a B&W movie, from the late 1950s, could resonate with SO MANY (what I guess are) young-ish people is a testimonial to how well-written, well-directed and well-acted this movie is  and, most importantly, after SIXTY years, how VERY topical it STILL is. But, hey, don't just take my word for it  buy it, and see for your self! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.67:1  B&W  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (25.2 Mbps)

  Once you get past the opening MGM logo sequence (which, honestly, doesn't look that good) and into the movie proper (starting with the vertical pan up the steps of the court building at the beginning), you will start to see that typical Criterion restoration magic on display  namely, excellent gray-scale, inky blacks (with great shadow-detail), fine sharpness (e.g.look at the patterns of the weave on the clothing, the detail of the wood-grain on the windows and the center table in the jury room, the visibility of individual hairs in hair-styles, etc.) and the total absence of artifacts (e.g.banding, lines, specs, fluctuations, etc.). And  on top of ALL of that  lots of glorious film-grain! Don't let others mislead you  film-grain is your friend, boys and girls (for, in the zeal of certain misguided souls [who, unfortunately work in the video departments of MOST studios, doing movie transfers] to remove it with video ""noise"" reduction, they also remove ALL of the fine details [like the ones I was just commenting on earlier]). So, let this movie (and, most of Criterion's work) serve as an excellent example of why you WANT to see film-grain  just check out the WEALTH of detail available for you to peruse in this movie (which would ALL disappear  along with the film-grain  if this movie were ""cleaned-up"" with video noise-reduction). Criterion's transfers provide Heaven on earth for lovers of classic movies  as well they should at these prices!

AUDIO:  LPCM Mono (48 KHz, 24-bit)

  Criterion also works audio magic  as well as, video magic  on the movies that it transfers. However, its audio magic is only apparent by what you DON'T hear (as opposed to, what you DO see, with video transfers). What you don't hear with this transfer is: hiss, static, bumps, distortion or any other untoward sounds. The film's dialog is very clear and natural sounding  with all voices being clearly defined and easily understood. However, the transfer's dynamic range is fairly limited, and there isn't any deep bass nor any top-end to speak of (which is okay, since there are no gunshots or explosions to worry about). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven movie from the late 1950s, this film's soundtrack has VERY good sound quality  which should please the vast majority of its listeners.
