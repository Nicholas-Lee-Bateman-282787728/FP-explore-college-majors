3876612,5,B0029E3RKA,This a very good movie another with Peter Faulk. I also enjoy watching Valerie Bertinelli. I like Peter as the angel  Max playing different people always being in the right place at the right time.  It is heartwarming to see her trying to find out if it is her brother Hank and why he is avoiding her. It shows how some experiences can cause some long lasting emotional affects that take time to heal.  Hank is nicknamed John  Christmas because no one knows who he really is. Also Noah who took the picture and can't figure out why the santa is not in the picture.  I like it cause it's supposed to be somewhere in New England where I am from.  Even though it is a fictional town there is things that remind me of here in Maine.,1424908800,,728,4.239130434782608

With all the trash that is on TV for children and adults to watch, it is a shame you can't release a family movie like Finding John Christmas!!!

I just hope that Hallmark is not going to the way like some of the trashy shows on TV!!!!",1322956800,,374,4.166666666666667

3876680,5,B0029E3RKA,"I agree with all of you.  I can't understand why this movie as well as ""When Angels Came to Town"" and ""A Town Without a Christmas"" (all starring Peter Falk as the angel) aren't available here in the US.  These are my favorites.  I used to have these recorded on VCR until my VCR died and was replaced with a DVD player.  If I had only known I wouldn't be able to locate these movies.  I have even tried movie download sites and can't seem to locate these three movies either.  It is such a shame!  If Hallmark and Lifetime only knew that they offered such wonderful movies that many people would love to own!  I can't understand why they don't offer these great classics on DVD for the US.",1295913600,6,689,4.246153846153846
3876681,2,B0029E3RKA,I had no idea that this dvd might not work on USA dvd players. I still haven't opened it because I am not sure if it will work. If I open it then I'm stuck with it or I can resell it and lose money. If I had only known I wouldn't have purchased it.,1295654400,2,248,3.5272727272727273
3876682,5,B0029E3RKA,"Why are there so many wonderful movies that are not release in USA format?  I didn't know it was going to be on or I would have recorded it from my TV.  I rushed in to order it because my family really needed this to send to my son but now that I find it isn't in USA format there is no reason to order it.

This movie made me cry but in a good way. It is a wonderful family movie and every family who has ever had a problem (are there any who haven't?)really need to watch this.  This movie shows that love doesn't have to end and there are so many times that there is always a reason for hope.

Someone, please release this in USA format.

I called the maker of my DVD player and they said that all DVD's (region's didn't matter) would play on their product.  They assured me it would. I ordered a DVD and it wouldn't play. So much for customer service at that company. I did some research and found their were codes to use to get it to play but they didn't work either.  The really good news is that I found the movie I bought will play on my computer and on my portable DVD player.  Has anyone tried this with this movie?  I don't want to spend this much money if it won't. Still, the problem is that I need to send it to my son and he won't be able to play it.  Thanks",1293321600,3,1273,3.914396887159533

3876685,5,B0029E3RKA,Why can't Finding John Christmas be purchased in the US. It makes  me sad to think that my grandchildren are going to grow up not seeing good movies like this. IT'S GOOD TO BELEIVE IN SOMETHING THAT IS MAGIC FOR A LITTLE WHILE. Shame on you. I'm trying to collect the Christmas movies for them. I know when they get older they won't be around. In my point Finding John Christmas is what Christmas is about and people are forgetting it.,1290470400,3,435,4.37037037037037
