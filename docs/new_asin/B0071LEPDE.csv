5047695,5,B0071LEPDE,"Price?  36.99?  Amazing!

My review here is based on the first half of the series on the blu-ray release from the individual releases, though it seems that the only difference was that I ended up paying about 3x the amount for the first half of the series.

Fullmetal Alchemist was a manga before anything else.  Around volume 9, a noted anime publisher contacted the manga publisher and offered to make the manga into an anime series with BONES as the principal animation studio.  They originally planned on 24 episodes, though the original series was so popular that the writers extended the series.  So the original anime flows along with the manga for about 10-12 episodes (with minor changes).  Some of the 'extra' stories from the manga (in the back) were added in as episodes as well (such as warehouse 13, Havoc and Armstrong's younger sister, etc...).  Because the anime was being pre-planned very early in the manga's run, the story diverges greatly at the point where her last manga had been published.  The writer didn't have much input, and she states as much in later issues of the manga, almost as an apology for the series varying so much.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a series that was created due to overwhelming fan demand.  Fans wanted to see the anime follow the manga more faithfully.  Bones and Aniplex decided ""Hey, why not?  We can make even MORE $$$""!  So Brotherhood varies from the manga early on, but lines up with the manga later on. (I have read every issue of the manga as well as seen every FMA and FMA Brotherhood episode).  There are some key changes, so that Aniplex didn't overlap too many story arcs from the first series.  Some of the changes (from the early few episodes) are here:

(Minor Spoilers):
First FMA vs Brotherhood
Fake Elric Brothers ~ no fake Elrics
Youswell mine story ~ no Youswell
Yoki appears only a bit ~ Yoki a major secondary character
Brig. Gen Gran big early role ~ Brig. Gen Gran only appears once
Doesn't show the 'gate' ~ Shows the gate and the 'truth' right away
Reveals who Pride and Wrath are very late ~ Reveals Pride VERY early

But those are the initial few episodes that vary.  Once we see the crew from Xing (who appear in Rush Valley), Brotherhood departs significantly from the original series and follows the manga much more closely.

In my opinion, the production quality is amazing in this series.  The characters and story are solid.  My only beef is this:  I highly recommend watching the original series first.  The reason is that the original series kept a lot of the surprises secret until later on, and they resulted in some pretty amazing WOW moments.  Brotherhood is more about the characters and their interactions, less about the surprise plot twists.  Brotherhood does come across as a manga faithfully transferred to anime, whereas the first series feels more like an original anime based loosely on a manga.

Granted in the original series, the main culprit, the source of the homonculi is different (and better imo), there are Xing characters, no General Armstrong, different homonculi (different Pride, Wrath, Sloth), and a whole hoard of other changes.

Of note: the Japanese cast is TERRIFIC!  Granted the English dub is nice, but I really enjoyed the nuances of the Japanese cast, especially Envy, Armstrong, and Mustang.  The English cast does resemble the Japanese cast, so good job on voice casting!  And the sound and clarity of the Blu-Ray is worth the extra few $$$.  This is one of the first full length anime series that was produced with High Def TV in mind (along with Gundam 00), and it shows.

*** I highly recommend watching the first series before watching this series or reading the manga ***
*** This set contains the FIRST HALF of the series, episodes 1 - 33; episodes 34 - 64 coming next release ***",1330732800,10,3820,4.737878787878788
5047696,5,B0071LEPDE,"Not the True complete Boxset I was waiting for but this will do for now. By true complete boxset i mean, All the episodes in one set. This Series to me is one of the best anime ever. A must buy for fans and newcomers. It will not disappoint. I pre-ordered the stars of milos bluray aswell. Which releases on the same day.  If a True Complete boxset releases in the future. I will be sure to buy it.",1330041600,,398,4.037974683544304
5047697,5,B0071LEPDE,"There are shows we just to waste time since there is nothing better to do. There are shows you see because it is the ""cool"" thing to watch. There are shows you see because of all the ratings and rewards it has won. But then there are shows like these. Blending story, music, action, art, and suspense. This show is a masterpiece. Anime like these are simply not created as often as they should. This show along with Monster, Death Note, DBZ, One Piece show what the anime industry is all about. There probably not be another anime like this again so anyone who is not going to watch this show is doing himself/herself is a disservice. This set with 33 episodes has an MSRP of $70 which is a great deal and worth every penny. The price for most stores is at $50 which is a fantastic deal. But at $36.99 it is simply a steal especially on Blu-Ray. BUY IT! You won't regret it.",1329955200,23,874,4.271084337349397
5047698,5,B0071LEPDE,I only saw the first episode when it was fan-subed and only watched half of it. After buying the complete collection of the first fma series i realized that i wanted to see Brotherhood. very convenient that they are re-releasing the series as a 2 part collection. ill wait until the 2nd part is released and wait for the prices to go down a little to at least 30-40 each and buy both at once so i can enjoy the series at my convenience.,1328486400,,436,4.2023809523809526
5047699,5,B0071LEPDE,"That's right, this series isn't just one of the best Anime I've seen, it is the epitome of Anime in my mind, and one of the best animated television series I have ever experienced. Okay, so I'm a newbie who just finished the series and is on a bit of a high from the experience but I stand by my statements. Due to a series of random events I actually wound up buying the entire series just a few weeks ago and watching it for the first time. I bought the 5 separate Blu-ray releases that are currently available, it cost me substantially more than this set (about $200 total), but I'm still happy I did it, that's how much I love this series. So if you like this series and don't yet own it on DVD/Blu then you have to buy this repackaged Collection 1 set, in my opinion, there is nothing else to it.

This set includes the first 33 episodes of the series. A nice even breaking point that leaves the remaining 34 episodes on the eventual Collection 2.
As far as the episodes, yeah the first thirteen or so are repeated material for anyone familiar with the first series and they feel arguably compacted as such, but any arguments about the series quality disappears by episode 14 and onward where the series departs from the first anime and plays true to the original manga.

I highly recommend this series on Blu-ray over DVD, it's not the best blu-ray picture you will ever see but this is among the most unique and beautiful anime animation I've seen and I wouldn't want to risk missing any detail of it if I didn't have to. Towards the end of the series some of the battles are evocative of the best work of Miyazaki. The streamlined and simplified animation style seems to suddenly break free during some battles and they really do some artistically masterful things that would normally be reserved for feature films.

I realize I'm mostly preaching to the choir for most people who will see this review but I honestly can't recommend this series enough to newer fans of anime who may have not seen it. In fact, I recommend it not only for fans of anime but also for fans of animation in general, fans of adventure, fans of epics, fans of anime, fans of good storytelling. People talk about Harry Potter and James Camerion's Avatar or those types of things as being immersive worlds, well FMA Brotherhood is not only an immersive experience but one with a substantially more well constructed story than those aforementioned stories and a perfectly satisfying ending. Those who have seen the series knew how great it was long before I did, but I've been converted and having now viewed this show, I know it will be a while before I have such a fulfilling and rewarding viewing experience again anytime soon. They just don't tell stories with this attention to detail that often.

With the new more affordable price this set offers, fans who have been holding out will no doubt now see this $60 retail price as much better than an equivalent exchange for all they're getting. If you buy this set then I'd say according to equivalent exchange you'll still owe much more than that.

5047736,5,B0071LEPDE,"- Synopsis: Despite the teachings, the Elric brothers attempt a deal that they will remember with their bodies. A painful lesson that will never fade as a reminder for breaking a taboo. This anime showcases the journey of these brothers as they set out to restore what they originally lost. No matter how bleak the road ahead of them may be, they stick together and help each other up when necessary.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: I usually prefer Japanese dubs over English dub, but the English one is awesome, so I preferred it over the other. I've only preferred English dub over Japanese in a few animes such as BlazBlue, Persona 4, Bleach, Naruto, etc.

This is a brilliantly executed anime with a blend of silly situations and serious do-or-die scenarios that are paired up almost effortless and naturally transitions between the two contrasting factors that further increases the entertainment value this anime offers.

Overall, just a fantastic anime with science, action, morals, life and death, and many other concepts. Very entertaining.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subs. Includes 33 episodes on 4 Blu-rays with a run-time of about 13.5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence, blood, and suggestive scenes.

5047764,5,B0071LEPDE,"The original FMA anime follows its own storyline while Brotherhood follows the story in the manga.  The two series have basically the same story until they get to Lab 5 and the two anime go in vastly different directions.  I'm not here to tell you which series is better.  I like them both equally because they are both excellent shows.  Brotherhood is much more fast-paced but it also skips a few things from the original series.  The first episode of Brotherhood has an anime-only story and an anime-only character and Mustang is introduced in a rather wonky way.  Mustang isn't introduced as this badass character but an useless one

I also like the origins of the Homunculi more in the original show.  Not that the origins of Father and his ilk are bad but there's really no explanation on where Father came from other than a throwaway line.  The motivation of Father is also kinda boring: become a god to ""fix"" the world.  It's just like any other anime plot.

Brotherhood is far from bad.  It has great characters, great action, great funny moments, great animation and a fantastic dub.  I feel like I should justify why I prefer dubs over subs.

The subtitles usually go by a tad too fast for me to read them. I usually focus more on the subtitles and nothing else.  Plus I can't tell who's talking if someone is off-screen unless they have a VERY distinctive voice; all I'm hearing is Japanese and NOT the character who's speaking.  I hear no accents, no emotion, no passion, all I'm hearing is a foreign language that I can't understand without watching what amounts to is a book--an actual book--shown on screen page by page.  I don't watch anime to read a freaking book.

Yes there are good dubs and this counts as one of them.

The original show is good and so is Brotherhood. I would recommend both shows actually.  They are equally good in my opinion.",1473465600,,1865,4.577039274924472

5047813,4,B0071LEPDE,"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second anime series, which directly adapts its manga source material. When the 2003 series was produced the manga was still in it's early stages, and Bones decided to create an original story line after the available material, which has become one of the most critically acclaimed anime of all time. So how does Brotherhood hold up? It holds up very well! What I should definitely state is this show is a lot less darker than it's predecessor. The best way to compare the two is FMA 2003 is like a mature award-winning young adult TV show you'd find on Adult Swim (which it was), and Brotherhood is like an award-winning Saturday morning kid's show that pushed it's maturity content to the limit. Both are great, and both shows divide FMA fans.
So FMA:B is a great show. Collection 1 could be seen as season 1. This show is written very well and its shines in every department. the only thing that really hurts this series is it's rushed first 10 episodes. The animators assume that people watching this have seen FMA 2003, so people who watch this first will not have the emotionally impact one should receive if they haven't watched FMA 2003 or read the original source material.
This could of been resolved if Bones came back to the beginning and create more episodes. Overall, this is a great anime. It's up to you, however, to decide if FMA 2003 is better than FMA:B or vice versa.",1465257600,,1426,4.640316205533597

It's action packed with hilarity, which is necessary to offset how dark moments in the sereis can get. It's definitely not for younger audiences given the nature of the story; gun shots, human combustion, and religious subtext aren't something any 6 year old will understand, and some images may be a bit disturbing.

While the title is changed, this is the Fullmetal Alchemist as it was originally intended to be. The original show differed from the original story as it was not complete when animation began. This story covers some of the first series in the beginning, but soon develops into the story it was meant to be. Vastly better in story, character, and conclusion, I cannot recommend this adventure enough.

If never seen before, this story is about two young alchemists who try to resurrect their beloved mother, and ended up paying a huge price for their mistake. Losing their limbs (Ed) and entire body (Al), they set out to seek a way to restore their bodies. They join the military of their country as they follow their trail, and learn that their country is hiding many dark secrets related to their quest. Desperate to find the strength they lack, to overcome their weaknesses and to be strong enough to help others, Ed and Al endeavor to uncover all the secrets and deeds of the military they serve. Themes of this story include family, coming of age, science/fantasy, humor, military, loyalty, artificial life and the ethics of scientific achievement.

5047944,4,B0071LEPDE,"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an excellent anime that should have been even better. The depth of plot, characters and meaning should perhaps have made it the best anime of all time. As it is, it comes incredibly close.

Fullmetal Alchemist by Hiromu Arakawa is one of the greatest stories in the realm of fantasy, developing a very large cast of characters in a realistic way few fictional accounts of any kind can rival. This in a fantasy world that resembles the real one all too clearly in its ambiguity. Along the way are numerous interesting and thought-provoking ideas that all escalate into one final confrontation with the truth that resonates with us more deeply than all the calculated tearjerkers in the world.

Add to this a wacky humorous note and an adventurous tone and what youve got is nothing short of ingenious.

Some of the choices made with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as an adaptation of the critically acclaimed manga render some moments absolutely phenomenal. Holding true to Hiromu Arakawas intentional downplay of many of the serious scenes, the music played in said scenes is usually of a light nature, prompting a step back from the intensity of the moment and making the event at hand seem more real. Similarly, the anime has moments scary enough to send chills down your spine without ever becoming dark.

So why cant I give Brotherhood 5 stars?

Because it leaves you absolutely no time to breathe; the lack of mood-setting and the amount of dialogue cut from the manga result in an overload of battle scenes and new developments that subtracts greatly from the whole experience, and perhaps most notably from the time needed to portray the characters in depth.

Add to this some heavy-handed gag execution and the mostly unmemorable music and artwork, and what youve got is a sloppily engineered masterpiece.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhoods flaws are not enough to ruin the anime by any means, and despite my previous remark about the artwork, there are a few amazing visuals, such as the ever-flowing red and black web that surrounds a human soul, and an explosive battle with flames. But when I think about what it could have been, I cant help but be disappointed.",1437091200,,2212,4.93010752688172

As other reviewers have said, the first ""Season"" is fine but it deviates from the cannon of the manga. Brotherhood is the real deal. I am often affected by music and the background ""hymn"" used during the story lines, especially the final episode brought tears to my eyes and made the end story and all the trials and tribulations the brothers had to go through that much more poignant. It was good to read that the boy who voiced Al in the first series (Aaron Dismuke) was able to come back and voice a cameo in this series. That is the only problem I have with Brotherhood, they waited too long to make it and Aaron no longer had the voice of a child and had to be replaced.

Very rarely do I see the need to actually purchase something which I can easily find online, but the quality of Brotherhood's story and animation is worth it. The amount of extras on the DVD's are quite generous as well, as almost every DVD comes with at least one commentary over an episode, hosted by the English voice actors.

If you're already a fan of FMA:B, then this, along with the second DVD set, is a great piece to have. For those who are unsure whether or not they want to watch Brotherhood, my advice would be to give it a chance. You can find episodes online to preview the series before you make a decision, and although the first eight or so episodes might seem jarring at first, the pacing mellows out afterwards.

Well all that has changed...I started my new obsession with avatar the last airbender and the legend of korra, even though those aren't technically anime, then moved on to this series. I am happy to say that I finished it 4 days because I couldn't stop and I have now bought the original series, the OVA and both feature movies.

The feeling is amazed, shocked,  excited,  happy, and oh so many feels...It's almost like anxiety. ..but in a good way...

5048087,3,B0071LEPDE,"This is a great show right after the first 4 or 5 episodes which are complete and utter trash. The first 5 episodes are literally the first 2 seasons of the original animated series chopped, spliced, and crudely included to the Brotherhood storyline... Characters once pivotal and necessary to the story such as Rose are now a clip note with literally eight lines of dialogue... There's no connection to the town of Reole has no real character to it anymore and is simply a speed bump to the actual story. Basically they should have just ignored the first fine episodes and re-worked them to work within the story line instead of being such a disconnect to the later ones.

After they are done literally re-hashing old footage the story picks up on its new venue. Granted there is an amazing first few minutes against the ""Freezing"" Alchemist, the show really picks up after they are done using what we've already seen, and it evolves into a spinning web of unexpected twists and turns even where once familiar characters are involved.

Eventually the story evolves into something entirely separate from the original series, with plot devices you can simply guess by the last one, but there are a few unexpected fly balls.",1412726400,,1222,4.786729857819905

The last disk come on a standard holder on the back of the set. The labels on the disks are really cool looking, and have little images softly hidden in the red coloring, such as images of various Gates, as well as transmutation circles.

5048147,5,B0071LEPDE,"I ordered this after watching the Soul Eater series (being new to Japanese animation).  Wow.  This is very well-written and has an incredibly captivating plot line.  I watched the last half of the series in one sitting.  This is much better than American cartoons (although I did enjoy Samurai Jack when I was younger).  The ending of the series is mind-blowingly good.  My only complaint would be that I wish some of the middle episodes had as much action as the final ones.

The characters in this series are very multi-dimensional and complex, much as real humans are.  They aren't necessarily good or bad; some who used to be evil changed and evolve throughout the story as they encounter new perspectives (which is something you don't see much in American television garbage).

All in all, I will be re-watching this many times, and if I ever have kids, they'll be watching this instead of whatever's on television.",1402272000,,920,4.808917197452229

The storytelling compelling. All the ""elements"" and ""emotions"" are represented and exposed to their weakest and most powerful degrees. Everything you could want from an anime and more.

Since FUNimation released the first series of fullmetal alchemist I considered the best release with an English dub ever produced and best shounen in a while.

I may sound extremist but there's a reason: Characters - Each one makes a difference within the plot and none are just simply there to fill in space and at times they are so well constructed that they steal the spot light and you feel for each one of them as you see who they are, why they are there and where they come from. Plot - It has a beginning a middle and an end. And I'm only saying this because when you think of other never ending animes you can see this one was clearly planned which makes the plot solid and meaningful.

5048200,3,B0071LEPDE,"In a world where alchemy--the ability to change one thing into another--is real, two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, commit the ultimate taboo when they attempt to use alchemy to bring their mother back from the dead. The experience costs Ed two limbs and leaves Al a soul bonded to a suit of armor. In ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"" the Elric brothers journey across their world to find a way to regain what they have lost.

""Brotherhood"" is a companion to the exceedingly popular original series (which was called simply ""Fullmetal Alchemist""), and this set contains the first half of its whopping 64 episodes. ""Brotherhood"" is not a sequel to the original; it's more of a reboot, and that's the key to both its strengths and its weaknesses.

In principle, ""Brotherhood"" follows the Fullmetal Alchemist manga much more closely than the first anime, but it's not unaware that many of its viewers will already be well acquainted with the story. Hence, the major events of the previous (fifty-odd episode) series are shown in the first 15 episodes of ""Brotherhood."" It's not a clip show, and it's not exactly a summary, but it does seem to be arranged with the intent of getting to the new stuff as quickly as possible.

In the resulting frenetic pace, scenes and events that were narrative and emotional climaxes of the original come and go in a rush--some of the most shocking reveals of the first series are fodder for the second or third episode here. The upshot is that ""Brotherhood"" is not ideal for newcomers to the franchise. It probably wouldn't be impossible for a neophyte to enjoy the series, but it would be a very different viewing experience.

Once the previously-on-FMA material is out of the way, the pacing settles down; tales that weren't in the first series begin to be told, and the story as a whole takes on shapes that are subtly but significantly different from before. This is where tried and true fans will be rewarded as ""Brotherhood"" begins delivering twists, cliffhangers, and revelations at almost every turn.

This deluge of plot might be for the better or the worse, depending on your preferences. In my view, one of the genius strokes of the first series was its insistence on the personal and moral struggles of the characters. ""Brotherhood,"" though, sometimes comes close to valuing plot points and pseudo-science over well-drawn characters.

""Brotherhood""'s status as a sort of mulligan allows it to lean on viewers' pre-existing attachment to the characters, and therefore it spends less time on character development and more on what happens to those characters. But if the series simply uses the audience's fond memories without building on or enhancing them in a meaningful way, it risks feeling empty, a mounting pile of plot contrivances.

As far as it goes, I think ""Brotherhood"" offers a chance for longtime fans of the Fullmetal universe to spend more time with a bunch of beloved characters, even if it never quite achieves the narrative momentum of its predecessor. New viewers, on the other hand, are strongly advised to start with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the/dp/B003SPDSA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B003VQO4W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>, then come back when they're ready for more.

(P.S. The packaging also deserves a word of appreciation. The DVD case for this set is the size of a normal case, though it contains five discs, giving it a pleasant heft. The exterior plastic is sturdy and the cover illustration striking. The discs are stored on individual panels, so you don't have to dig past one disc to get to another; in the same way, the discs sit firmly but are easy to take out and put back in. This is really top-class packaging and makes the series a pleasure to handle.)

5048219,5,B0071LEPDE,"100x better than the original anime. I loved how this followed the manga's storyline almost exactly. The brothers also seemed more 'human' in this one and there were a little less ridiculous outbursts from Ed about being short. It was graphically much better as well, but that likely is due to it being Blu-Ray while the original is DVD. The graphics on these discs are nothing short of amazing. I don't think I've seen better animation in any other anime Blu-Ray.",1391990400,,464,4.7407407407407405

Again, this is an amazing anime and definitely worth every second.",1389830400,,358,4.790322580645161
5048234,5,B0071LEPDE,"A faithful adaptation of the manga - perhaps unnecessary since there was already an animated series, but if (like me) you thought the original manga plot was much more satisfying, it seems you have been noticed. This, then, is a more or less perfect translation of that story into anime form; a strong, familiar shounen series which does nothing remarkably new or surprising (except for a tendency to include genuinely excellent female characters), instead concentrating on doing all the usual tropes /right/. Add to that  some character design that isn't afraid to target female audiences, and you have a fantastic adventure series.

The English dubbing is quite bad, so it's rather annoying that Vic Mignogna gets star billing over the vastly superior Romi Park, but that can't wreck a show this good. At least, not when subtitles are available.

Watch it if you like shounen stories. Watch it if you like hot boys. Watch it if you like badass ladies. Watch it if you like exciting powerful characters who also get to have emotions. Watch it if you think fantasy is better with industrial machinery and military uniforms. You should probably just watch it.",1389571200,,1158,4.958762886597938

For anime its quite funny and the main characters are very like able in there adventure for the philosopher stone. You may wonder whats the difference between this series and the normal Fullmetal Alchemist. All I have to say from a fan who's seen both Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood watch and buy the Brotherhood series its the better one of the two since the whole series is done by the creator of the franchise.

The anime deserves a five star rating and thats why I decided to support the anime by buying it. I watched the whole anime on tv and because it had such an influence on me I bought it. I barely started watching the bluray but so far its been amazing. I would recommend this to people who enjoy philosophizing. Some other of my favorite animes are death note, trigun, fooly cooly, ghost in the shell, Naoki Urasawa's monster, cowboy bebop, bleach and the original naruto.

There are a few exceptions, and I'd say that despite my aversion to Anime, this is one of my favourite shows. I couldn't quite get into the original FMA.

The animation is nothing less than exquisite and the talking scenes are as well drawn as the action scenes.
The dialogue can be humorous (e.g. Alex Louis Armstrong, Jean Havoc, Maes Hughes) but it can be serious and potent whenever it wants to be.
While the humor can be awkward, not only does it grow on you, but it diminishes the further you go in the series.

5048268,5,B0071LEPDE,"The essential anime for anyone interested in the genre of entertainment. Having brothers myself, I'm a sucker for stories about brothers. Especially when they're this well told. With blu-ray, we're just getting the best visual quality possible. It also explores a fantasy idea that I have yet to see anywhere else. The characters are so vast, and so diverse, there's always a handful everyone will like, if not love. It's also one that manages to have a dub that even purists support. I'm used to dubs, and usually prefer them, unless I feel the tone and intention are off.
American cartoons usually don't explore as wide of a berth when it comes to themes and characters. Fullmetal has pretty much everything put together. There's a reason it remains number 1 on the animeplanet ranked list. The only reason it's not my absolute favorite is because DBZ (Dragon Ball Z) connects to me on a masculine level obviously. Fighting and explosions. Comedy. Then more fighting and explosions.",1384560000,,984,4.933734939759036

It has enough humor to balance out the serious. The battles are well done and there are many unique aspects to Fullmetal Alchemist. If you want to watch the original, make sure the buy the movie too, as the ending is very unfulfilling without it, and I wouldn't watch the movie unless you've seen the original because it and Brotherhoods' story lines are quite different after the first few episodes.  So far after watching Fullmetal Alchemist I've only really enjoyed Fairy Tail, and while it was extremely hilarious, the over dramatic-over the top scenes were almost too much for me.",1379376000,,729,4.785714285714286

Big fan of Full Metal Alchemist. A great compilation. Definately recommended to save you from buying all those other DVD sets. The only bummer I find in these DVDs are that they don't have English with English subtitles. I know, why would I want to. I personally always go Japanese with English subs, but my boyfriend is too lazy to read the texts, jerk. I find that the English dubs are far too soft sometimes and that I can't hear. My surround sound system becomes too load after I try to turn it up.

I don't want to give any spoilers but if you're new to animes then this is a purchase you should consider. The English dubs are spectacular which makes following the story so much easier for new people.

5048329,5,B0071LEPDE,"The only bad thing about this anime is the beginning of the series, because is tries to compress the first 5-10 episodes of the first series into 4 or 5 of brotherhood, it feels kinda rushed, after that the series gets going and will never stop, it's amazing 'till the very end. The characters feel so natural, so believable, like they live in a part of the world we haven't found or been there before, great villians, not black on white characters you can relate to the protagonists from the very beginning, and sympathyse with them and understand why they do the things they do and fell sorry for them, what they have been through e.t.c.
All and all this series has influenced me and other people for many reasons, great messages and I believe can be enjoyed by all audiences, It has his its funny moments but it's dark and sad, It has its quircky moments but it is serious and ""down to earth"" and In my opinion is the best anime out there, one you can re-watch again and again and still enjoy it and discover new things you haven't seen in your first watch.

The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that the subtitles cannot be enabled with the english audio track.  There is no way to turn subtitles on and off (the functions are restricted by the disc) so you either have English Audio with No Subtitles, or Japanese Audio with English Subtitles.

5048366,5,B0071LEPDE,"I recently have been watching the anime subbed on Youtube and Hulu, so I was overjoyed to find that I could finally watch the anime dubbed. But as any anime I have a few pro's and con's:

Pro's
  The voice actors in this did a amazing job on this, the writing is superb, and the suspense keeps me up in the night till 2 in the morning. I'll admit that in the beginning I was very ""if-ie"" about another person playing Alphonse Elric, especially since it was a girl, but over time I grew fond for the ""girly"" Al. When I went back a few days ago to watch the original it was strange for me to hear the other persons voice playing as Alphonse! I have to say that the animations are also wonderful as well as the writing. Every point gets across as the Elric's discover a evil plot involving the philosopher's stone, what it is it made of, and what they have to do with it.
  I would recommend FMAB to any FMA fan who didn't like the ending (like me), or anyone who was a fan of the darkness in Soul Eater or the drama in Fruits Basket (the manga).

Con's:
  One of the reason's why I bought FMAB on Amazon was to make Amv's and post them on Youtube. What I didn't factor in was that the DVD's might have been copyrighted (which they are) which means that I can't upload them to Movie Maker or PowerDirector. The only way how to get rid of the copyright (as far as I know and if you've got a better solution please reply with it) is to get a DVD Ripper (AKA more money down the drain). Also another problem arose while trying to make these videos: you need the disk in the player while having it up, so I couldn't have more then 7 episodes (ex:  Ep. 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7). The point is this is that if your buying this to make Amv's DON'T buy off of Amazon and make my mistake over again. If you have had this problem already easiest solution is to buy it off of Itunes. This makes to so you can have what ever episodes you want in it so you can have the 1st episode and the last in the same Amv .Keeping that in mind, the first season costs around $30 while the second season is split up in parts so I can't tell you how much is the total cost is, but you will have to invest money in this.
  The only problem I found in the anime is that the beginning feels a little rushed to me. The first 5-8 (?) episodes that spanned the first 1st and (in some cases) 2nd volume of the manga gave very little time for character development and attachment that was found in the first go at the Fullmetal Alchemist ""world"". For example, Nina in Brotherhood didn't have much time to develop (Rose was another character I felt they didn't do justice to).
  Don't be surprised that a some of your favorite characters didn't come back to do Brotherhood. A some new people had to come and do the voices characters such as Roy, Alphonse, Maes, and more.

If you have doubts about whether to watch this or not, go to dubbed online or Youtube and then buy FMAB if you like it. I give it 5 stars for the suspenseful action and drama this anime has to offer. Well done Funamation!

It blew me away by the end of the first disc.  Apparently it follows the Elric brothers' journey a lot more closely to the manga, and fleshes out so many of the characters so much more.  It goes in a much different direction than the original FMA, and it's a good thing!  I'm really looking forward to watching Collection Two as soon as I can!",1373673600,3,717,4.1521739130434785

Although the bonus features are spare, each disc features an episode commentary and textless openings/closings. Also, the box art of both the exterior and interior was gorgeous.

As for the actual show, well, I'm on the fence about the first half of this season. I feel that the pace is very rushed; I understand why, of course. This is a remake of the manga and the first anime, which differed greatly from the manga but had the creator's blessing. There is a lot more going on in this series and the general animation quality is improved (although the original also featured stunning animation).

5048412,5,B0071LEPDE,"At first I was going to say that once you got past the first few episodes the series truly began to become amazing, but upon further thought I take that back. This show is powerful from the very beginning, and while the first few episodes aren't as addicting as the later episodes of the series, they are beyond a doubt powerful enough to get you interested. In fact, the first 4 or so episodes have plenty of scenes and themes that can be quite disturbing and memorable. Once you get past the first few introductory episodes, the plot really starts to become addicting (specifically after a certain event which those who have watched the show can probably guess what I'm talking about) and it becomes really hard to not want to keep watching episode after episode to further the plot.

Since this is the ""Complete Collection One"" of two of FMA Brotherhood, that means that you only get half of the episodes in this collection. Considering you get over 30 episodes, this is actually a pretty hefty collection and definitely has a sizable amount of content in relationship to the price.

So, in short, Brotherhood is a fantastic and memorable series that doesn't last long enough to run itself dry, and the first collection you see here is a great way to become addicted to the story of the Elric brothers.",1362182400,,1305,4.645021645021645

5048417,4,B0071LEPDE,"I'll be the bad guy and say, in the end, I still preferred the original series. Hear me out before you instinctively try to flame me.

I will always envy the technical aspects of this new series. It's a shame, plenty excellent series are marked by the stigma of not being in HD. They'll never look as good as the modern stuff. But, it's because of the original's success that Brotherhood was made and got the Triple-A budget to throw around. A budget that allowed them to bring the mangaka's original vision to life. It would all rest on Hiromu Arakawa's vision.

Overall, in my personal opinion, the series themes are less focused.

Both series have the same starting point, Ed and Al try to bring back their dead mother. While, in the original, this original sin hangs over the entire series, in Brotherhood, it's eventually feels inconsequential. Clearly, the original took what they had, and built on top of it. In the manga, Hiromu Arakawa could built whatever she needed, and keep expanding. So, it does feel like it's a ""world tour"" of the world of FullMetal Alchemist (the world feels so much bigger in this version), but sometimes characters fall in and out of the series with little explanation. The minor characters get new moments, it's not much more than the original series, so it's not that big a deal.

Still, 4-out-of-5 does not mean bad by a long shot. What it lacks in focus, it hides behind some awesome action. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I practically marathoned the whole series in two weeks. If you must have more FullMetal Alchemist, I would recommend FMA: Brotherhood (especially on Blu-Ray). But, if you're a more frugal consumer, I'm guessing you can always find a friend to borrow it from.

It's a good series, but not a great series, in my opinion. I'm not saying the original is perfect, but Brotherhood feels more uneven at places.",1361491200,,1864,4.6880733944954125

5048434,5,B0071LEPDE,"Note: This is a review for the entire Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood anime, not for this particular volume of the set.

For the past several years, I had considered the original Fullmetal Alchemist to be my favorite anime of all time. It featured everything that I loved most about the genre: driven young protagonists, a fantastical and vibrant fictional world, a coherent set of combat mechanics, dynamic fight sequences, gorgeous animation, a well-thought-out and complete plot, and darker, more mature themes. Thus, when I heard that the series was being remade to more closely reflect Hiromu Arakawa's original manga series (which I have not read), I was excited to see the result. Could the full story written by the creator of the Fullmetal Alchemist universe manage to outdo the already-phenomenal anime that was more loosely based on her work?

The two answers to this question, I am happy to declare, are yes and hell yes.  Although it gets off to a slightly uneven start, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood manages to surpass the quality of its predecessor by a healthy margin. It is one of the best television series I have seen, and it fulfills the promise of modern anime in a way that no other title has.

For those who are not familiar with either series, a brief plot synopsis is in order. Brotherhood follows the journey of two teenaged boys, Edward and Alphonse Elric, as they travel in search of the legendary philosopher's stone. Their world is a bit like Europe in the early 1900s, but with a significant twist: humans can tap into the power of alchemy, a mysterious science that enables its practitioners to reshape and reconfigure matter. In order to achieve their goals, Ed and Al must contend with their country's dangerous military, ambitious foreigners from the Far East, a revenge-obsessed serial killer, a traumatic past, and seemingly immortal foes with deadly supernatural powers.

One of the greatest strengths of this series is that, whereas the original FMA had a more direct and tightly-knit feel to it, Brotherhood is vast, open, and sprawling. The world is bigger, features a much larger cast of characters, and involves conflicts that are far greater and more earth-shattering in scope. The main characters seem to get more done, cover more ground, and learn more about the world around them. Even though Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a mere 12 episodes longer than Fullmetal Alchemist, it feels as if it explores a great deal more content. This becomes especially satisfying when one reaches the massive, perhaps 15-episode-long, concluding arc. In this, all of the storylines and motivations of all of the characters converge for one massive, epic face-off, building towards a final resolution which--despite a touch of anime cheesiness--is legitimately emotionally powerful.

Another quality that makes Brotherhood so outstanding is its superb animation. I consider it quite tragic that many modern animes (Last Exile and Ergo Proxy come to mind) cut corners when it comes to the animating process, using numerous still shots and barely allowing the characters to move at all. Fortunately, FMAB stands in stark contrast to this trend. The series favors acrobatic battles, detailed movements, and impressive light effects, providing a genuine feast for the senses. The fight scenes deserve special praise here. There are dozens of excellent fights in Brotherhood, and in them, the animators succeed in conveying a magnificently kinetic, gravity-defying, and hard-hitting style of combat. If you aren't watching these sequences in all of their widescreen, blu ray, high definition splendor, then you are absolutely missing out. The only bad word that I have regarding the series' animation is that its backgrounds do tend to be underwhelming.

Which brings me to the few downsides of FMAB. To begin with, viewers who have already seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist might be bored during the earlier episodes of Brotherhood, since both animes start by following the manga rather closely. They made an effort to distinguish Brotherhood by presenting scenes differently and introducing some new characters, but to me, the first 13 episodes were something of a slog. Additionally, the beginning portions of FMAB contain a bit too much in the way of corny Japanese humor. I would be comfortable with this fact in and of itself, but the real issue is that the characters frequently switch over to goofy comedy mode in the middle of serious moments, such as the protagonists' first interaction with the main villain. Thankfully, this stops being an issue perhaps halfway into the show, after which point the humor is confined to separate, nonessential scenes. My final complaint is that the series' music was lackluster overall, consisting of only a few unextraordinary tunes that were repeated often. Some of it was alright, and the songs for the starting and ending credit sequences were almost all great, but I think that Brotherhood would have been more dramatic yet if it had featured a stronger soundtrack.

Having said all that, I believe these issues are negligible on the whole. The bottom line is that you should watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, period. (Watch it on Hulu, if you must.) It's exciting, smart, long, original, expansive, satisfying, and visually stunning. In many cases, anime series tend to be overrated; indeed, it is extremely difficult to find one with an amazon rating lower than four stars. Brotherhood, however, actually lives up to its hype. Anyone seeking a great, high-budget modern anime--or just a beautiful, character-driven story full of loss, struggle, and triumph--need not look any further than this masterpiece.",1359849600,,5703,5.20479302832244

5048437,5,B0071LEPDE,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is by far, one of the greatest series that I have ever seen yet.  Before I had even started to watch the series, I had read the manga. In my mind, I could hear the characters talking, and I could visualize what happened between panels. I read through all of the books, and it quickly became my favorite manga. I loved it so much, that I was willing to watch to watch both of the shows, even though I usually don't like any television show when I had already read the book. However, I wasn't displeased.

Since this anime followed the manga so well, I didn't have to critique the anime for doing something wrong, or something that was off from the manga. I didn't have the choice to; they did such a good job at making the manga coming to life. Although there were scenes that were different from the book, they were really minor things that didn't affect the book's plot.

Unlike the original Fullmetal Alchemist series, this anime has a plot that's worth seeing. I found myself jumping up and down for joy at some of the exciting parts, and screaming happily when Ed was winning at a fight. This anime will grab your heart, and tug at your emotions. The homunculi were very much real, and were very active in the plot. The action felt real, and was perfect.

I would recommend this anime for anyone who is looking for a new anime to watch, anyone who has seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist, or just anyone who is a fan of adventure. Ed and Al will easily capture your heart, and you'll find yourself wanting more and more Fullmetal.",1359244800,,1568,4.472027972027972

5048450,5,B0071LEPDE,"Like my review on the 2nd half of series

I'm a selective person when it comes to what I watch and this definitive exceeds my expectations. For an animated series it's really well-thought out and has a lot of themes and great plots. A lot of what is going on doesn't make sense at first but it will all come together. It's an INTERCONNECTED type of story, not the linear type where a single event before hand is affecting the next, but rather multiple interconnected events coming together. Character development is great too. The animation is superb. To me, even some of the small and short scenes contribute greatly to the overall story, if not the small details just adds to the flavor of the story for those that enjoy seeing the small things.

I've watched it at least 3x now, caught stuff I didn't pick up the first or 2nd time around. Love this. I even bought a copy for my friend!

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood didn't recapture the emotion of the first series, but it's still very good.  The animation is stunning except in a few scenes, but I can forgive those cases since it is a slightly longer series. I'm glad that they got the original cast, with a few exceptions, to reprise their roles, and they do an amazing job once again.  The main issue that I take with this series is that it has much more of a ""shonen feel"" than the original.  However, for the most part it still has some very dramatic moments, some of which I had wanted to see in the original.  Overall, I would heavily recommend watching the original series first, but definitely to give this series a chance as well.",1358294400,,852,4.578947368421052

5048472,5,B0071LEPDE,"So, I got this for Christmas and I want to say that this is something that I will forever treasure! This is Fullmetal Alchemist how it should have always been told, I still like the 1st series, but this is a masterpiece. FMA:B has a much wider cast of characters, but they all hold their own and help to expand on this wider truth revolving around the Philosopher's Stone and the Homunculi. In part 1, we suddenly start seeing the story diverging and becoming complicated, but as a viewer, I will assure you that you will become entangled in this brilliant story and the search for the truth hidden within the truth.

Not only has the story become great, but the blu-ray quality is amazing. The drawing style is crisp and fighting scenes are amazing. Also, all openings and ending songs are amazing and this is the first anime series where I have loved them all which shows how the creators of this have done their best to assure that all parts of the show are fantastic, which they are.

Get ready for a journey to uncover the truth as you go along with the Elric brothers as they do their best to reclaim what was lost. While they are tired, they will continue to move forward finding strength in themselves and in those that have supported them and become family.

Prepare for tears, sorrow, laughter, happiness, anger, and redemption. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is really a tale of the world and trying to overcome it. It's worthwhile, I hope you enjoy!",1356825600,,1462,4.593869731800766

What you might need to know is that it is worth owning on Blu-ray rather than the DVDs, or over your streaming options for that matter if you love the series. I've watched it multiple times via fansub, Netflix, owned the first 3 DVD sets, and they all pale to the quality of the Blu-ray.

For most anime it isn't worth the price of admission to chose Blu-ray over DVD, except in the rare case that Amazon drops the price lower on the Blu-ray (thank you Amazon, appreciate the push). However, for this series I have done side-by-sides of the same episodes on DVD vs Blu-ray and there is such a difference.

5048523,5,B0071LEPDE,"Wanted to start off saying that I did watch the original. This is almost completely different! When you think you know whats going to happen or you think you know why something happened, think again.
When I got this, I got my roommate, who doesn't watch anime, hooked by the first episode! We could not stop watching because we wanted to know what happened next. Again, there may be similarities with FMA and FMA Brotherhood, but it seems the story has changed completely for the better! Really considering this one of the best animes.
Now for the product itself, it is amazing.  Usually complete box sets of anime with 26 episodes usually range from $40-$50. I got this box set for around $30 with episodes 1-33. It comes with the box cover sleeve if you tend to keep those on your DVD/Blu-Ray cases. This set has 4 disks. Set is organized with each disk on each side of either of the 2 holding flaps inside the case. I watched this on 40"" HD TV using my PS3 and the images were so clear crisp. Picture was amazing. Never had a problem with audio. Pretty sure I heard everything that needed to be heard. For those people that watch the opening or ending themes, I noticed that they switch between english subtitles with japanese lyrics every now and then but I don't think that matters much unless you want to try to sing the song in English or Japenese.
Overall, this is an amazing product.  For any anime lover or those trying to see what it is all about, this is one that's recommended. It has a lot of action that can be a little violent at time and also can be really humorous at times.

In all but one single episode (""The Interlude Party""), there is at least one guffaw moment.
Yet, in each and every episode, there is at least one very deep moment, whether emotionally or philosophically speaking, and it's never let up.
Excellent dialogue (whether straight up or quirky), very excellent drawing (even including Japanese symbols and translations), and a comprehensible story with many plot points that connect efficiently.
There subtle differences between this and the original anime, well some were subtle (like how certain lines were said or the tone used to say them) and others were pretty obvious (certain scenario changes), nonetheless, I found myself enjoying this incarnation much better.",1352160000,,997,5.3164556962025316
5048526,5,B0071LEPDE,"This was the longest series I've ever watched. I don't have the patience for long anime, but I found the patience for this one.

As far as the technical stuff goes- I absolutely loved the voice team. You will recognize most to all of them from Soul Eater and Ouran High School Host Club, other productions from Funimation. The art style was great- if you've seen the accompanying movie, ""The Sacred Star of Milos"", you must know that the art style is nothing like that. I'm watching it now and it makes my eyes hurt that they changed the visuals so, so much. The soundtrack is fabulous. I'm currently working on perfecting ""Rain""- the fifth opening theme- on my saxophone. The music is beautiful throughout, including the background tracks.

Plotwise, this is the best you will find. It is an emotionally wrenching story, which offers a ""cast of snowflakes""-- dozens of characters and you care about all of them. Here's a brief rundown(spoilers are avoided):

The Protagonist: Ed. After losing his mother at age five, he and his younger brother tried to bring her back to life after six years of research into the science of alchemy- but it went horribly wrong. Ed lost a leg, and his brother's body disappeared completely. Ed was able to call back his brother's soul from the other side of the ""portal"" where they were trying to pull their mother from, but he had to pay an arm to be able to bind said soul to an empty suit of armor for him to live in.

The Object of the Plot: Al. Al is the younger brother of Ed, whose soul is fused to a suit of armor he can walk around and speak with. The series revolves around returning his and Ed's bodies to their former state. However, the stakes are much higher for Al, as souls bound to inanimate objects tend to deteriorate after a few years, and the series begins four years after the accident. Al is the calm, caring balance to complement Ed's hotheaded demeanor. He later gains a sidekick named May, a hilarious, adorable, ten-year-old girl whom you will either love or hate, no in-between.

The Love Interest: Winry. After Ed and Al's mother died, the boys were informally adopted by an old woman named Pinako Rockbell, an old friend of their missing father's. She was also taking care of her orphaned granddaughter, Winry. Pinako, or ""Granny"", as the kids call her, raised all three to spectacular success. The boys became well-known in the field of alchemy, while Winry was a prodigy in the field of engineering. The world they live in is textbook steampunk, and at age eleven Winry was able to build Ed a fully-functioning set of artificial limbs to replace the ones he'd lost. She disapproved of the boys she calls her brothers joining the military to gain access to valuable alchemical research, but understands the necessity of it. She also has major anger management issues, and is known to throw wrenches at customers she finds irritating, especially accident-prone Ed, who is back for repairs at least once per month.

The Facilitator: Colonel Roy Mustang. A war hero from the civil war ten years before, the Colonel asked the Elrics to join the military three years prior to the start of the series. His ultimate goal is to be able to protect every person in Amestris, the fictional country this takes place in, and so he wants to become the Fuhrer. He is also an alchemist, and his sidekick, Riza Hawkeye, a sniper, is one of the most-loved characters of the series.

I could go on and on. But I won't. There are a LOT of important characters in the series, and then there are the supporting characters, who are also important. And each one has their own speech pattern, back story, style of dress, and motive. This is a tremendously well-thought-out series.

That's all I can say. The ending moved me to tears, although I did not cry at something you would call sad. I cried at the way it ended.

I must warn you- you must get past episode four. It is extremely disturbing, do not watch with small children, but it is worth it.",1350777600,12,3989,4.59915611814346

5048539,5,B0071LEPDE,"FMA Brotherhood is a retelling of the original FMA series. It is essentially the same premise, but with a few plot alterations. The main differences lie with the characters. Some of the old characters were different. For example: Ed and Al's Mom didn't become a homunculous. Their Dad had a completely different back story. There was also a new homunculous, who posed as the Fuhrer's son. Lust also played a minor role in this series as well.

On the heroes side Major Armstrong has a sister. General Armstrong. She's even more hard than the Major. Her subordinates also played a crucial role in the story and were all pretty cool as well. One of the main plots of the story was a couple siblings from a foreign country that were competing for the right to become emperor. The main thing that bugged me about Brotherhood was the replacement voice actor for Scar. The new guy is good, but it's strange to hear a different voice coming out of a character that I liked so much.

Even though it's different I really like Brotherhood. It is really cool. If you like the original you'll like this retelling.",1349740800,2,1101,4.612244897959184

I'm a guy who watches Hitchcock to study the pacing, screenwriting, and camera angles. I've read Aristotle in the original Greek. I am not the run-of-the-mill naive teenage anime fan. This series is visually innovative, heart-breaking, frightening, thrilling, uplifting, and very well done. In terms of its scope and characters, the fairest comparison is in my opinion Victor Hugo. It's also one of the few anime series where the diversity of drawing styles keeps pace with the diversity of drawing styles in the original manga. You'll get more out of it if you have a basic familiarity with anime and manga tropes, but if you lack that knowledge, you now have a very good reason to obtain it. This series gives John Woo's 1980s classics serious competition, in my opinion, for the title of best Asian storytelling. It is very, very good.",1348876800,,936,4.783950617283951

After the first few episodes the story kicks up the pace, and the latter episodes on Collection Two fly past in a flurry of amazing conflict and resounding accomplishment, not just for the characters but for the story-telling itself. An unbelievable achievement for what is basically a remake of a story that had been half-told a few years ago, before the written story had even been finished. This anime follows the manga almost frame for frame, burying the original Fullmetal Alchemist into distant memory.

This is what storytelling should be; characters that distinguish themselves from one another completely, with no two feeling remotely the same, and a story arc to rival that of Homer's ""The Odyssey."" I would go so far as to say this epic gives anime what Homer gave literature: Characters you love (or love to hate), a goal the main characters strive for, love, loss, and redemption.

The voice acting for the English Dub is all I can vouch for, with the cast giving astonishing performances. Not to mention the animation itself is some of the most slick on screen. An absolute pleasure to watch.",1347148800,,1255,5.0

5048546,5,B0071LEPDE,"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great anime and a must see in my opinion.  There is a lot of action and character development, and not to mention that the story as a lot of twists in it to keep you guessing. This blu-ray collection is great and you will not be disappointed.",1346457600,,280,4.384615384615385
5048547,5,B0071LEPDE,"i absolutely love this anime series because it touches my hart and its everything i look for in a series
i would pay a lot more then 32.47$ and its a great value it contains 33 episodes and they look great

now the commentaries are great because you feel like your getting to meet the voices of these amazing characters, you must get this if your a true fan of FMA, cant wait to get part 2 once its cheaper of course its 59.99$ atm so i will wait for the price to go down a bit or just buy it at the price it is if i get inpatient which will probably be once i watch all the episodes on collection 1.",1346112000,,600,3.8780487804878048
5048558,5,B0071LEPDE,"Now I was not always a fan of anime, but I must say that after hearing all the great things about this series and then finally taking the initiative to purchase it and see it for myself I am more than pleased at how great full metal alchemist really is. Get it, and get it in bluray. Not only does it look great but the STORY is excellent, the PLOT is compelling, and the CHARACTERS are vivid and memorable. Action packed and full of excitement, Full Metal Alchemist is a must for anyone wanting to experience the essence of anime.",1345248000,,531,4.32
5048559,5,B0071LEPDE,"FMA Brotherhood exceeded all of my expectations, just a truly amazing show.  I won't go into any details, but one episode that stood out to me was Episode 4.  Such an emotionally deep episode, yet a little messed up at the same time.  Major Armstrong is one of, if not, the best anime characters of all time.  Do yourself a favor and buy this collection.",1342483200,,354,4.4
5048560,5,B0071LEPDE,"The clarity of the animation on Bluray is amazing, only surpassed by the reworking of what was already an anime, and animation, classic. I'm not usually a big fan of retooling something that is on the surface NOT in need of a fix, but in this case it's well worth the effort to see the difference. A MUST see.",1341705600,,309,4.254237288135593
5048561,5,B0071LEPDE,I think full metal alchemist is a great series and the characters are so well done. I just wish I had the second part to the complete collection. I would defiantly recommend this to others,1341705600,,188,4.4
5048562,3,B0071LEPDE,"The blu-ray set contains the first 1-33 episodes on 4 discs.

- when playing the English 5.0 dub the audio volume is low (the original Japanese 2.0 volume is fine). You can switch between languages seamlessly while in episode and it becomes very obvious. On most Blu-ray/DVDs I only need my tv at half volume. On this set I have to double the volume level to be able to get it to the same level. Also the intro song volume is louder than the actual show so we get blasted by the opening theme if we leave the volume up.
 *note that I do not have additional speakers setup. A true theater setup may correct this issue.

- subtitles only available when playing the Japanese audio. We like to compare the direct translation to what the English audio says, on some series you miss vital information because it was altered to fit the dub, this is not an option on this set.

Otherwise a great set.",1341705600,5,892,4.355421686746988
5048563,5,B0071LEPDE,"i just got it 2day when i opened it i realized there isn't anyting tell you what episodes there is on each disk. For example the one piece collection it tell you what episodes are in each disk like 1-6

overall my rating would be 4.5",1340755200,,233,4.065217391304348
5048564,5,B0071LEPDE,"I haven't bought this complete DVD collection yet, but I am going to. I already have it all separately, but want the whole thing, just because!

Summary: FMAB is the story of two brothers; Alphonse and Edward Elric. The boys lose their mother to illness, and they try to use alchemy to bring her back. This goes horribly wrong because they neglected the basic rule of alchemy, the principal of equal exchange. To gain something from alchemy you must give something of equal value. The brothers' disastrous experiment costs Edward his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Ed manages to affix Al's soul to a suit of armour, at the cost of his right arm.

A little while later a colonel in the military, another alchemist named Roy Mustang, invites the brothers to become State Alchemists, an offer only Edward accepts, giving them access to the enormous resources of the military that brothers hope will help them to recover their lost body parts. The brothers set off in search of the Philosopher's Stone as a means to restore their bodies. Throughout their journey, they meet allies and enemies and discover the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone, and an awful secret plan that they must fight to prevent.

FMAB contains that wonderful thing, a totally original, self-consistent universe different from ours, but familiar enough not to be off-putting. The characters are all distinct, fully-formed and convincing; you will love most, and hate a few and not care much one way or the other about others. The story is brilliant. It begins in a relatively small way with the brothers travails, and expands into something magnificent.

It's mood is finely judged. There's some light comedy, some tragedy, a lot of action and something to think about, and all the while the character development is gripping. The relationships between the characters are complex and changing, and the brothers grow up during the series, adding more levels. There are those wonderful moments when you see one of the enemy attacking the wrong person and you think ""That was a mistake"", because the relationships are clearly enough defined that you know retribution is on its way. A lovely example is Roy Mustang, the Flame Alchemist, explaining to a homunculus that has just attacked his 'dearest subordinate' how he uses one hand for macro effects like burning an entire room and the other for pinpoint attacks, like evaporating the fluid in the hapless homunculus' eyeballs. It is the minute attention to detail, all detail, that makes this special.

The graphics are excellent. I really like them for both technical quality and art. I have recently seen 'better', but that was because the goalposts moved, and techniques improved. FMAB still has 10/10 graphics.

I recommend watching in Japanese with subtitles. It's just better. The American voice actors did a good job, but it's just more characterful with Japanese voices.

As I said in the title, I think that this is probably the greatest animated entertainment ever made. If you only ever watch one anime make it this one. If you watch anime anyway and haven't seen FMAB, do so. It would be a complete waste of your life if you were hit by a meteorite before you saw it. When was the last time you saw a cartoon 25 hours long and couldn't stop watching, despite the fact that life would be somehow empty after it was over?

Do yourself a favour, buy this. It's not a lot of money for the epic adventure you are about to experience. It may well be the best money you ever spent.",1340150400,,3517,4.811258278145695
5048565,4,B0071LEPDE,"I feel obligated to write a review for first class entertainment I've received from the series. Like other reviewers mentioned, this remake (following somewhat strictly from the manga) is very different from the first series, which I found it distasteful...really.

Story - 10/10:
Intense and flawless. You wouldn't find so many anime series that tell the story this well. Everything is so concise, yet fulfilled. I was driven emotionally, and I learned lots of well-thought messages throughout the series. It's great for all ages, really...except numbers of bloody scenes that might rule out younger audiences. Great character design also contributes to the story. Almost every supporting character is interesting and full of background story that have purposes and contribute to the main storyline as well.

Art - 9/10:
I appreciated the artistic drawings of this anime. There is very limited use of CG. Characters are drawn sharply with great details, while backgrounds tend to be blurry or with rough textures. This might not be for everyone's taste though.

Voice - 9/10:
This is for original Japanese voice talent only. I don't watch English dub, so I couldn't comment about it. I'm glad that they were able to get the whole cast from first series back. They did fantastic jobs contributing to the overall impact of the series.

Soundtrack - 10/10:
Ok, I'm not talking only about their OP and ED theme songs. In fact, I want to point out the actual music throughout the series that are totally amazing. These soundtracks are surprisingly performed by a full symphony orchestra...some even performed together with a chorus. With the talent of Akira Senju, the music is absolutely beautiful and well suited for scenes they were selected for. (""The Intrepid"" and ""To Be King"" are some of the prime examples here)

Package - 6/10:
This is the only part that is bad about this product, in my opinion. Something this Epic shouldn't be packaged in one of the most ""vanilla"" box ever. However, the price is cheap. So some might say ""You get what you paid for..."" which I agree for the most part. Just that I'm utterly disappointed. Although, I think Funimation might have marketing genius, because if they make the collector edition eventually...I will buy it again.

Overall - 8/10:
It's a great buy, nonetheless. You would never regret spend this much for the hours of entertainment you would get from it. This is one of a few series which you can watch it over and over again...and appreciate it over and over...again, if not more. I seriously watched the series back to back. I couldn't make any statement for Funimation, so I don't know if there would be a collector edition later or not...although I bet there will be. If you can't wait on this loosely speculation of mine, just get it...no need for second thought.",1339977600,5,2819,4.911764705882353
5048566,5,B0071LEPDE,Finally the pack collection of this amazing anime with bluray's quality. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't have spanish subtitles. What a shame! I'm waiting for low prize in collection two.,1339632000,,197,4.823529411764706
5048567,5,B0071LEPDE,This item is awesome. It's worth ever penny I sat down and watched it for like three days straight. I've already pre ordered collection two and can't wait for it to come out,1338249600,,173,4.2727272727272725
5048578,3,B0071LEPDE,"I bought this thinking that it was the whole series of Brotherhood but apparently it is part of a set. Make note people who want to buy the complete collection it says ""complete collection 1"" and its only episodes 1-33. When the series goes up to 64 episodes. I didn't bother returning this product because I <3 Brotherhood. Other than that I have no complaints.",1337904000,2,362,4.584615384615384
5048579,3,B0071LEPDE,"I won't go into a review of the series because there are 15 5-Star ratings and they will all tell you just how great of a show this is. What I will be reviewing is the actual box set. I have been waiting for a complete collection because the part sets are a bit too expensive. Now that I have what I wanted, I am a little disappointed to be honest.

First I'll start off with the good:

- The price is amazing for a 33 episode set.
- Nice new disc art (The part sets had pretty plain discs).
- Awesome inner cover art.

And... That's pretty much it.

Now for the bad:

- The nice holographic effect used on the covers of the part sets is not present.
- The cover looks plain because of what was stated above.
- Could have chose better front cover art (they used the original promotional photo).
- No bonuses like the postcards in this set.
- For a complete collection you'd think they could have mustered up some DVD extras that weren't on the part sets.

I know the old saying ""you get what you paid for"", but Funi should have spent little more time on this set. The product just looks a bit rushed and incomplete. This isn't a bad set at all, it's just a budget one. If you're interested in the series and don't want to spend a lot, buy this. If you're a big fan and want something a bit nicer, buy the part sets.

My actual rating would be 3.5 stars.",1337904000,6,1353,4.083018867924529
5048580,5,B0071LEPDE,"so this review will only be about the contents, not about the series itself. if your here than you know about fma b and how awesome it is.
so as the collection states, this is a 4 disc bluray containing eps 1-33. basically each disc has around 9 eps to each disc. this is how i believe the individual volumes should of been. i hated that disc 1 had 9 eps and disc two only had 4 eps. what a waste of a volume this initial release had. but this collection makes use of every but of space on the bluray.

the first 3 discs only have the usual commentaries that were originally on the first release of this series. the final disc in this collection has all 3 textless openings and endings, as well as some trailers for dragon age, tsubasa chronicles and fma:B ova that comes out next week.

i should note that the bluray cover is dual sided and the one facing inside is a real nice one that you can see through the blue book case. i like it when companies put the time into doing a release right.

well there you have it, info on the bluray collection part 1 of fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood. now go pick it up!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Brotherhood-Complete-Collection-One-Blu-ray/dp/B0071LEPDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood: Complete Collection One [Blu-ray</a>]",1337385600,,1356,5.071748878923767
5048581,5,B0071LEPDE,"This collection is amazing for the price and for the content it holds.. It looks soo good on blu ray. you will not want to go back to those version they have on netflix and hulu.
The only bad part about this is that it doesnt contain all Season 3, but Fullmetal Alchemist Collection 2 is on its way soon.",1336608000,,304,4.083333333333333
5048582,5,B0071LEPDE,"What is the truth in morality and life? Who is truly good and evil? Through the journey of two young brothers, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood comes up with its own answers to these questions; and quite impressively.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the awesome elements from the first series and simply polished them to follow the manga more efficiently. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art. Totally worth the buy. Cant wait for Part II of the complete collection.",1335916800,,562,5.043010752688172
5048583,5,B0071LEPDE,I have to say I really liked this one better than the other version before (I cannot call it the original because it does not follow the manga) But this is sooo good! Do I like this more than the other (Fullmetal Alchemist)? Yes yes I do. This anime series is up there with my favorites Clannad after story. I cannot wait until the second collection comes out. I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! ^_^,1335916800,,404,4.259740259740259
5048584,5,B0071LEPDE,"For any fan of FMA or just wanting something original FMA:B could be your saving grace!!! FMA:B is the based on the best-selling manga Full Metal Alchemist that follows more closely to it it's manga counterpart. The Blue-Ray has everything you would expect astonishing 1080p quality, crystal clear dual audio & cool commentary. Also love the fact it doesn't take a arm & a leg to obtain lol (FMA pun). If love FMA then ur in for a real treat for FMA:B!!!",1335312000,,454,4.548780487804878
5048585,5,B0071LEPDE,"I've been following anime since the early 80s. I've seen it's highs and lows..and believe me lol, it has WAY more lows. Anime is a lot like my other favorite genre in Horror..its has tons of entries and tons of crap. That's why the decent ones like say Dragonball Z and Kiddie Grade resonate...it's why we take notice of the better than average one's like Vampire Hunter D, Naruto, & Big-O and why we stand up for the few masterpieces like say Wolf's Rain, Chrono Cross, and Death Note. The first run of FMA was the best anime series I'd ever seen..barely edging out Wolf's Rain while still taking a hit on the much quoted ""weak"" ending and weaker feature film. Then came Death Note and that was number 1 all the way to stay seemingly. But then the FMA did something unexpected and wonderful, they listened to the fan gripes and redid the series keeping it faithful to the manga this time around. The result is so much better than the original run it's outright staggering IMHO. I really can't see another series topping this. The pacing is flawless and the story keeps you glued until it's over..yet leaves you yearning for much more. It's a story I could follow indefinitely. I will say this tho...the original run had the superior soundtrack IMO:-p So whether you love anime or are simply curious...BUY this.",1333670400,,1311,4.6068376068376065
5048586,5,B0071LEPDE,"Don't take that title lightly. I have been watching anime for about 12 years now and never have I been so moved by a series. This is my first written review on Amazon. After seeing this deal for the complete collection I felt compelled to share my experience. If you are a fan of anime this is a MUST own. Even if you don't watch anime or anything animated I implore you to give this series a chance. I can not speak highly enough about this show. Bottom line is if you want to be engrossed in a deep and rich story, filled with complexity and heart then look no further than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.",1333497600,,608,4.2956521739130435
5048587,5,B0071LEPDE,"I began in 2011 watching this series on Cartoon Network/Adult Swim with much scepticism already in hand.  After all I have already seen and own the original Fullmetal Alchemist series and the movie.  What was Funimation doing, milking us the fans with the same series with minor twists?

At first it seems this way.  Granted the very first episode is radically different than the first episode of the first series.  Still for about 8 episodes these series side by side are very much the same.  THEN a divergence happened, things started to radically change.  The two series were no longer mirrors of each.  In time I actually had forgotten about the original series, the new rendition is that good.

Plot wise this series is a 10 out of 10, versus the original which I now rate a 5 out of 10.  The Humunculi are really delved into in this series.  There are better ones than in the first series.  PLUS, all the original voices returned for this series, which is another 10 for me.  The original voices were PERFECT and having them return was genius.

This Anime series is supposed to be strictly based off the manga series.  The original series was based off the manga as well.  But the manga was still being written and released, so the developers decided to go in their own direction with the Anime, much to it's detriment.

The fight scenes are epic in this release.  The mysteries are drawing.  The lessons are so profound and true.  One theme I always liked about this series, (either one), is that when you do something truly bad the consequences are with you forever, no matter what you do.  Such is the case for Ed & Al and for us here in real life.

I don't want to give any spoilers away.  This was on Adult Swim early hours of Sunday in 2011, I am not sure if it is still on, if it is I would recommend you check it out if you are not sure about this.  I myself plan to buy this someday when I have the $$$ and space, (I'm out of room for new movies...), and will proudly display it in my Anime collection.  For this is Fullmetal Alchemist truly done right by the fans.

This particular release will encompass one half (1/2) of the series.  I imagine the other half will be released in the summer some time.  This is the best value and the way I bought the first Fullmetal series.  Combined both halves will still be dramatically cheaper than if you bought the individual volumes.  So save up and get this if you missed it.  Make sure and get BLU-RAY also, it is WAY cheaper than the DVD release.  It appears the makers of movies are finally pushing us straglers into buying BLU-RAY players.  Another thing on my to do list...

FYI, if you are really short on cash and have a high speed connection that doesn't cap you Gigabits every month, watch this entire series on Hulu or Youtube.  It was all there dubbed and subbed last time I checked.  Try the animenewsnetwork.com as well, may be there too..., bare in mind streaming isn't TRULY free, and you do get tracking cookies installed and you are also bombarded with advertisments sometimes.

However you choose to watch this, if you love Anime or Fullmetal, you owe it to yourself to check this out.

Hope this helps, and as always sorry for any misspellings, I went to public school...",1333497600,46,3249,4.453310696095077
