3797686,5,B001UDS4BS,"Though there have been many films about the horrors faced by illegal immigrants attempting to get into or stay in the US, few films have addressed the issues on both sides of the table as well as CROSSING OVER.  This film probably did not do very well in theatrical release because of the very difficult subject matter with which it confronts the audience: few people who go to the movies to escape the realities of life outside elect to be disturbed.  CROSSING OVER, as written and directed by Wayne Kramer, forces us to learn just how treacherous the matter of immigration is on every level - from the border incidents, to document fraud, to worksite enforcement/raiding, to the concept of asylum, to naturalization, the green card process, the problematic office of counter terrorism, and finally to the basic cultural clashes that pit compassionate law officers against red neck raider type officers.

To absorb the intricately woven aspects of the script, a script that addresses immigration issues dealing with Koreans, Africans, Iranians, Australians, Mexicans, and Jewish/atheist Britishers, the audience must pay close attention lest the subtleties be lost in the swirling nonstop drama.  Harrison Ford as the compassionate, burned out immigration officer Max Brogan holds the film together as he attempts to make sense of the various irregularities in every aspect of the immigration process. His partner is Iranian American  Hamid (a particularly fine performance by Cliff Curtis) who faces family problems with his American born sister and his father who is on the brink of naturalization - one of the many subplots that involves 'honor killing'.  Another man Cole Frankel (Ray Liotta is a smarmy role) reveals another view of a 'bad agent' while his wife Denise (Ashley Judd) fights for the rights of an African orphan held for 23 months awaiting sponsorship. A brave Iranian girl Taslima (Summer Bishil) speaks out for the rights of Muslims to be heard  and plunges her family into deportation problems.  Among the other subplots are stories about a Korean family whose one son (Justin Chon) is forced into gang warfare, an Australian actress (Alice Eve) who must secure her green card through sexual favors with Cole Frankel, a Mexican mother Mireya (Alice Braga) who is captured during a raid at a workplace and befriended by Max Brogan, and young British musician (Jim Sturgess) who must convince authorities of his 'Jewishness' in order to maintain a job that will result in a  green card.

Each of these stories represents an aspect of our current dysfunctional system management of immigration.  The film does not take sides: it merely presents a smattering of the atrocities and imperfectly managed departments of government that together form a system that is chaotic.  Of interest, Sean Penn (listed as being in the cast on this page of Amazon.com) requested his small role be cut because of the objections of Iranian-American groups over the use of the 'honor killing' subplot.  That may indicate how many people may view this film: the story will either anger or disgust some viewers.  But what this very well acted and produced and directed film does is provide windows through which we may more closely examine the tragedies of our current immigration system.  Perhaps change will occur once people are informed of the injustices.  Grady Harp, June 09",1244937600,8,3378,5.092391304347826
3797687,4,B001UDS4BS,"I have been following Harrison career for 30 years as of next year.  USED to be first in the door opening day for his films.

I found it VERY strange this film had no press or publicity when it was released.  Nothing.

Was it the subject matter?  Maybe.

A topical subject now, especially where I live in California.

THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW.

This film just is NOT good.  Harrison did his normal great job with his role, YES ANOTHER COP.
2 D lister's in supporting roles & no one else of note.

1.  We have TOO MANY STORIES GOING ON AT ONCE.  How many different illegal alien families or people the film is showing us.  Some doing good things here, other breaking further laws, etc.
2.  That Claire character.  Film makers, WHY DID WE NEED ALL THE NUDE SCENES WITH THIS ACTRESS?  Claire is dumb, she goes to the correct department to check on her paperwork (NOTE WE GET THE NORMAL WOMAN BEHIND THE COUNTER WHO IS RUDE & NOT HELPFUL)  Did the Claire character  HAVE A COPY OF HER PAPERWORK SHE KEPT FOR HER RECORDS OR OF HER MONEY ORDER? Nope, but we had to have a scene with her paying off A GUY AT A COPY MAKING COMPANY.  So, she knew what making copies was BUT DID NOT KEEP A COPY OF SOMETHING THAT IMPORTANT?  Oh, boo hoo, I sure was NOT crying when she was deported.
3.  Judd & Liotta were husband & wife.  Yet, we see 2 scenes with them together, the first at their home where she starts trying to talk him into adopting the little girl.  FILM MAKERS, HE HAD NEVER EVEN MET THE LITTLE GIRL, why was there not a line, like ""Come & meet her""?
4.  The family getting mad & 1 member killing the sister because she was having an affair with her married boss?  Oh please.
5.  Harrison's character & all the things he did concerning that 1 illegal alien woman & her kid.  Why did his bosses let him do that?  Go find the kid & then take him to other family members.  THAT IS NOT HIS JOB, that is Child Protective Services.
6.  And, of course, the 1 girl after her 9-11 paper at school.

Just, not good.

A big disappointment.

DVD package.
We knew there would be no extras. No chapter search list.
HAS THE HORRIBLE, LITTLE FLIP OPEN FLAPS ON IT.  I HATE THESE THINGS.
DVD package.  Harrison only got the reference to the Indy films.  Gee, did we forget 3 other little films released in 1977, 1980 & 1983?  ""The Fugitive"", his Oscar nominated role in ""Witness"", ""Air Force One""?
Judd has had 2 hit films, instead of mentioning say ""Double Jeopardy"" they mentioned a ""Twisted""  Anyone remember this 1?
Liotta 1 hit film, from 20 years ago of course ""Field of Dreams"".  ""Smokin' Aces?""  What?  A straight to video thing?
Just, over all, a poor film & NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE DVD PACKAGE

My rating, ONLY for Harrison",1244937600,6,2715,4.305555555555555
3797688,1,B001UDS4BS,"This movie has no plot whatsoever. Harrison Ford's performance is bland like the entire movie. I think the idea behind this movie was to show the ""injustices"" in our immigration system. Example; ""an adolescent Arab-American girl gives a cheeky speech at school that puts her family under suspicion as possible terrorists"". The ""cheeky"" speech is actually a justification for the murder of thousands of innocent people on 9/11. The whole movie rants on like this and we fast forwarded through most of it. If you were expecting a detective/mystery/action movie, this is not it. My recommendation, don't waste your money. The movie's description on the jacket and on Amazon is way off what the movie is really about.",1244678400,25,713,5.0508474576271185
3797689,5,B001UDS4BS,"It's been a long time since a movie surprised me like ""Crossing Over"". I'll be honest, I didn't know much about this movie, other than it starred one of my favorite actors, Harrison Ford, and that it tackled the immigration issue. I expected a decent movie and Ford doing his usual great performance, but what I found was a riveting moving drama with superb acting from a very talented ensemble cast! What a fantastic movie and one I HIGHLY recommend. As I watched this movie, I was reminded of other ensemble movies with weaving story lines such as ""Magnolia"" and ""Traffic"". I consider myself a serious movie buff and not an easy critic but this movie really won me over and I consider it one of the best movies I've seen in quite a while. Don't miss this one!!",1244505600,68,762,4.489208633093525
3797690,4,B001UDS4BS,"Let me just get the Weinstein (more fondly known as: [W]e [E]dit movies [I]nto [N]othing [S]ince we are the [E]ntertainment [I]ndustry [N]arcissists) laundry out of the way. This will most likely be one of the best films no one saw this year with only a 40 theater slate and no advertising (it did not make any of the distribution posters, no marketing). The only press it did get was Sean Penn having his fit and being removed from the film's cut altogether. The DVD cover art and description has nothing to do with the film, and the usual Weinstein bare bones DVD on what should have been a packed product.

This Southern California ensemble piece covers an intertwined variety of topics and story lines over the course of a couple weeks. Immigration, racism, peer pressure, and a failing system filled with both passionate and immoral servants, make up this Crash-esque film. Too much gets crammed in to these two hours as there are 14 main characters and 10 supporting. No one has significant screen time over the other, so this is not a Harrison Ford, Ray Liotta or Ashley Judd film (as the cover would make you think). It is a character film about sensitive topics that you will disagree with, maybe support or feel indifferent towards as they are all thrown across the screen.

It is a very good film, and nothing about the post-production press should deter one from seeing a solid character performance on everyone's part, albeit some of the roles disappear as fast as they appear (especially Lizzy Caplan's bookend role - loved her in True Blood and My Best Friend's Girl).

The picture clarity is excellent throughout, the city scapes and large volume of overhead pans all looked professional and articulate (would be very worthy on BD). The 5.1 only fooled me only once so it mostly gets used with the score and there are no special features. Would of course love to see the director's 140 minute cut as there are two sequences where there were obvious removals of material, but this makes for a solid weekend rental, or even a purchase for the low price this is.",1244246400,8,2075,4.695054945054945
3797691,4,B001UDS4BS,"This is realism at its best! With immigration issues more current than ever this movie addresses the growing immigration and the often sad human destinies involved - not only among the immigrants but also among the very government agencies and bodies ment to manage the situation.

Having outgrown Harrison Ford movies (typecast for decades) as I left my teenage years my expectations were very moderate as I entered the theatre - did I turn out to be wrong again!

Harrison Ford delivers a solid performance but the movie is so much more than him - in fact most of the other characters are delivering excellent performances - and refreshingly all are depicted in a shade of grey - rather than black and white as we have come accustomed to from Hollywood for decades. It brings back sweet memories of American Beauty in this department.... in itself something I for one have been longing for for a long time.

The storyline resembles another excellent movie, Crash, in its shifting between multiple stories which in the end turn out to be intertwined and Grand Torino in its coverage of the immigration issue but with far superior acting and plot. In fact particularly the acting of the immigrants were excellent and far superior to the appauling Vietnamese actors in Grand Torino.

At times a bit depressing but also heartwarming and certainly a must see movie.",1241049600,43,1362,4.857758620689655

3797711,4,B001UDS4BS,"As government agencies go, ICE is not one that is apt to have too many movies made about it.  It is lacks the glamour of, say, the CIA, DEA, FBI & NSA.  The present movie gives an honest effort to offer the viewer the circumstances encountered by ICE & peripheral agencies such as the Border Patrol on a daily basis.

Harrison Ford plays a senior ICE supervisor who does raids on sweatshops in CA.  He does his best to do the right thing.  Sometimes, doing the right thing is not altogether congruent with the letter of the law.  Such is life in the ambiguous field of illegal immigration.  With the contentious nature & vitriolic rhetoric offered by politicians, it is sometimes difficult to recall to mind that immigration is not just about statistics.  For every statistic there is a human being behind the statistic.  Sometimes they are as reprehensible as the far right would have us believe.  Other times they are as sympathetic as the far left would have us believe.  The truth is somewhere in the middle.

On a lighter note, many people may have an interest in the present movie for the same reason I did:  it is the one movie where the stunning Alice Eve strips down!  She is actually topless 3X during the film.  While she has a bit part, she is unmistakable & this film as a building block towards bigger & better things.  Way to go Alice!!

Ultimately, this film reminded me a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;in that it is not a conventional movie.  Like CRASH, it is several disparate storylines which are cobbled together into a narrative that inquires into the whole illegal immigration question.  While there are people who have no business being in the U.S., there are also individuals who take advantage of helpless persons who are in dire straits.  This includes people in both the public & private sectors.  So, on that count, this is a thought-provoking movie about a topic that is anything but black  & white.",1480118400,3,2083,5.0469208211143695

3797746,4,B001UDS4BS,"The reviewers who complain that this movie doesn't really help us understand the extent and the intractability of the immigration crisis in the age of ""national security"" are right -- but I'm not sure that any movie could do that and I'm pretty sure that this movie wasn't attempting anything so ambitious.  Rather, the movie wants to remind us of a simple fact: among all the numbers that are thrown at us, and in spite of the polarized and under-informed ideological posturing, and in the face of the impersonal bureaucratic machinery established to deal with these problems, individuals' and families' lives are being impacted in quite horrifying ways.  You might think that that kind of focus is an invitation to a sentimental response to circumstances that require really hard thinking and really detailed knowledge -- and, again, you would be right.  Sentiment is the name of the game.  I would just say that there is a place for it, even as we need much, much more.  But on its own terms, this works pretty well.  It combines a number of stories of immigrants and ""illegal"" residents from the Iran, Korea, Mexico, Australia, sub-Saharan Africa and takes us through some of their encounters with ""the system.""  This being a movie, it's no surprise that some representatives of the system use it to exercise their own power or seek satisfaction for their own desires -- the characters played by Ray Liotta and Jacqueline Obradors -- while others try to bend the rules as far as they can to humanize the system and preserve families whose breakup is threatened by the deportation of one member -- Harrison Ford and Ashley Judd play the sympathetic characters who do so -- but sentimental though the movie might be, not all the benevolent interventions are successful, and there are harrowing moments.  When a teenage Iranian-American girl is deported on suspicion of supporting terror (on the basis of a report she gave in class). her mother goes with her, leaving her father and sister behind.  The scene at the airport is painful to watch, and very well acted.  The immigrants aren't the only sufferers:  Ashley Judd plays an advocate for immigrant children, while Liotta, her husband, is an immigration officer willing to trade green cards for sexual favors.  Harrison Ford plays a weary honest officer, who tries to keep a young Mexican mother and her son together, and he effectively conveys the fatigue that inevitably accompanies the constant battle to help people live with dignity.  Ford's character'spartner belongs to an immigrant Pakistani family whose older members are about to be naturalized and yet who are trying to impose traditional codes of conduct on the younger generation, not all of whom are interested.  That situation leads to the most melodramatic confrontation in the movie, a scene in a convenience store that involves a Korean kid.  The final scenes -- one at the naturalization ceremony and one out on the Mexican-American border wasteland are tense and effective.  So yes -- it's sentimental and it's not analytical -- but it's alive to human costs, and that's something that a movie can get across perfectly well.",1447718400,,3150,4.9714285714285715

3797775,4,B001UDS4BS,"Crossing Over is an independent film about illegal immigrants of different nationalities struggling to achieve legal status in Los Angeles. It deals with the border, document fraud, the asylum and green card process, work-site enforcement, naturalization, the office of counter-terrorism and the clash of cultures. The ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford and Ashley Judd together with Ray Liotta,Jim Sturgess,Cliff Curtis,Alice Braga and Alice Eve. It was written and directed by Wayne Kramer.

Every day, a new batch of immigrants comes flooding into Los Angeles in search of the American dream and every day the price of that dream rises exponentially. As the desperation of these newcomers continually tests the humanity of Los Angeles immigration enforcement officers, the face of a 21st century L.A. gradually begins to take form. The story takes harrowing look at life among illegal immigrants and the immigration enforcement agents whose job it is to ensure that the U.S. borders remain secure.

Anyone who has seen the movie,Crash will likely appreciate this film that is a multi-stranded and a heavy handed film that explores the issues surrounding immigration and US citizenship with the involvement of many characters. Unfortunately unlike the said film,Crossing Over lacks subtlety since many of the events seemed contrived and superficial.

3797807,4,B001UDS4BS,"The movie covers six or seven intertwined story threads broadly covering major immigration issues.  It offers a candid look at the issues with an emphasis on the immigrants, seen through the eyes of an enlightened (and depressed) ICE officer.  I have found it valuable in educating about immigration issues in the US.  As the stories are woven together, skipping around the story lines, it is a bit difficult to show a particular story straight through.  And it is R rated as it should be, though the violence, profanity and sex is only shown as necessary to develop the stories, and not added gratuitously.  I am told that ICE officers as caring and going way out of their way to be helpful (the Harrison Ford character) are quite rare.  There are other Hollywood aspects to the movie, but the core of the stories ring all too true.

3797831,5,B001UDS4BS,"I must admit I struggled with this movie.  This film discusses multiple viewpoints on the issues of immigration to the U.S.  Some viewers have put it down because of the role of Harrison Ford...expecting perhaps an action flick and being disappointed.  Others have denigrated the film for its adult themes.  Perhaps others might be opposed to this film on the basis of its content, believing that 'America is for Americans' and that this film shouldn't have been made.  I know a number of Native Americans that would disagree with this last one.
Ultimately, this movie should be considered to be about illumination, shining the light into the dark corners of our immigration system.  We all know it is dysfunctional, and what is represented in this film are just a few generalized stories of events that occur on a daily basis.  No one person or group is to blame, we are all a part of the process.  Ignorance of the issues is not an excuse, and the problems of the world, including that of immigration, do not spontaneously resolve but should be met head on by all concerned parties.  Immigration is a social, political and human rights issue and regardless of heated emotions should be discussed with an open mind.  After a fashion, we are all immigrants, we all just arrived here at different times.  This is a film that should be watched and discussed.  Through discussion and understanding come illumination, and eventually, action to change the system to one that is more relevant to the modern world.  We all have a mind, a voice, and hopefully a conscience.  This movie reminds us to use our innate humanity and compassion for positive change.",1392076800,,1651,4.808510638297872

Personally I don't really care for these movies that have intertwined story lines as they always seem too contrived.  I didn't realy think that Crash was that great although it had a great cast.  This movie at least touches on the real dilemma regarding immigration in this country.  The first problem with this film is presenting Harrison Ford's character as an ICE immigration officer with a conscience concerning the people he is arresting. One such person he believes has a heart condition, another has a young son who would be abandoned without intervention. It is an interesting film and worthy of a rental, but not really a movie you would want in your library of movies for repeated viewing.

3797874,4,B001UDS4BS,"This movie takes on the subject of immigration...both legal and illegal, and immigrants. It tells separate, but sometimes overlapping stories, so there is not really one overriding plot. It touches not only on attempts to get into the country, but attempts to stay in the country after being here. It also touches on how even people who are Americans are not always assimilated into the culture.

The movie explores issues of racism, gang violence, extremest religion, fraud on the immigration system and within the system and more. It has a tone and pacing of the movie is much like Traffic and Crash. Even though there are multiple stories going on that are not really connected, the movie does flow well and does not get boring. I think the two most compelling stories in the movie were the Muslim teenager who gives a speech at school about understanding the 9/11 hijackers and the consequences of that, and the one involving the family of Harrison Ford's INS partner.

This movie is definitely not going to appeal to everyone. Immigration is a touchy subject anyway, and the issues it hits aside from the illegal immigrant parts are ones that cause a lot of debate. I think the filmmakers did a good job making a movie that would spark discussion and debate. And although you could definitely tell the tone that they were trying to convey in each of the stories I do not think the movie came off as too preachy either on the side of all illegal immigrants should be deported, or everyone should be granted asylum side. I would say that the overall tone is closer to the latter than the former, neither viewpoint was totally thrown at you. Harrison Ford's character was the perfect example. He spends the entire movie looking for a woman that he rounds up for deportation early in the movie, but is still doing the same job at the end of the movie.

Liking this kind of movie will be very subjective. If you like movies like Traffic, Crash and Gran Torino, this one is worth taking a look at. Even if it is just a rental. There is a lot of bad language and nudity in the film, so if those will offend you then you are better off skipping this.",1370131200,,2147,4.55699481865285

3797898,4,B001UDS4BS,"Crossing Over is a good attempt at giving viewers a storyline concerning the ever so popular as of late subject of green card issues and illegal immigrants in America.

The storyline focuses around different ethnic groups living in America, and the constant struggles and dramatic situations they have to persevere on a daily basis.  The flow of the movie is divided so there's a decent amount of attention given to each of the plots that focuses around a Jewish man who doesn't know much about his culture, a Middle Eastern school girl who creates controversy at her high school, an Asian man who gets involved in dangerous gangs against his will, and an Australian woman who sleeps around.

None of these people ever come into contact with each other- the writers of the film made it so it's four stories constantly jumping back and forth.  It actually works though because it means when one story overstays its welcome, the other story comes along and entertains the viewers for a few minutes.  This is what the pacing is like the entire time.

There's a lot of nudity concerning the Australian woman- please keep this in mind.  Without spoiling anything, each ethnic group goes through a series of ups and downs emotionally just for the opportunity of getting to live in the United States.

I'd say for the most part the storyline maintains a somewhat interesting flow, but the thing is, it's entirely up to *you* concerning how interesting such a subject really is.

If you've lived in America your entire life, you won't find such a subject particularly interesting, which is a situation I found myself in while watching Crossing Over.  I've never had to encounter green card issues, so such a thing was not really *new* to me necessarily (I'm aware of the issue since I watch the news quite often) but never something I ever gave serious attention to.

There's never really much attention given to the actual borderline between Mexico and America, even though you get the feeling there should have been.

There's a really violent and surprising shooting scene involving a mini mart that the Asian guy is a part of.  Don't miss this part.

My biggest complaint is that Harrison Ford is getting quite old- too old for such a movie.  I'm kidding, haha.  Though he *is* aging dramatically, he did a fine job in his performance.  His role decreases as the movie goes along though.

The movie itself is pretty watchable and occasionally thought-provoking.  It's got a quality cast and great production values.  But ultimately it comes across as a paint-by-numbers message movie that tries to check all the boxes and connect all the dots in ways that muddle and mix-up the message.  Of course, that may be the point.  But the questions the movie asks ultimately asks could provoke just as much discussion written on cards in a board game.  Is it better to sleep with an INS agent to get your green card?  Or to fake religious devotion and persecution?  Did you come to America because you believe in its freedoms and ideals?  Once here, would you risk deportation by engaging in the free speech you had heard so much about?

Similarities to movies such as BABEL, TRAFFIC, CRASH. FAST FOOD NATION and even GRAN TORINO echo throughout.  And clearly something went wrong in the execution and/or marketing of this movie.  It was shot in 2007 and only released in 2009, with scenes including Sean Penn edited out along the way.

If you're not in the mood for a board game, there are worse things to do than watching and pondering the questions posed in CROSSING OVER.",1264204800,15,1769,5.297491039426523
3797914,2,B001UDS4BS,"Well people in the U.S do need to ask themselves where the bounderies and borders lie with this country and others. Is it right for the U.S to play World Police and take out young innocent women and children just to liberate a country or attempt to establish a stable government for a country that has had political chaos for 1000's of years, certainly not. Is it right that Arab(Middle eastern) terrorists took out the world trade centers with our own planes in an attempt to justify there believes and kill a few thousand of our men, women and children, absolutely not. So who's wrong and who's right, well no one really and this film really doesn't touch base on either one being right or wrong. But on the other hand Ashely Judd defending a young girl who gets up in front of the class of her high school, saying that her Arab brothers were justified in doing what they did to us, and we just don't understand is down right appalling. Also the areas of our so called prejudice against illegal aliens in this country was jumbled up and mismatched as well. The film overall was pretty much a mess, it was interesting to certain issues touched on, but they have already been done in several other films. Mexican gangs, Arab Terrorists, and people crossing our borders into the U.S is a problem, but this movie does nothing to rectify and of these problems, but does nothing more than either glorify them or just confuse the viewer on who thinks what. Fords performance and even presence in the film felt more like he was just going through the motions and showed no real interest in the topic at hand. I think he's becoming desperate to keep himself on the big screen since he's aging and not a lot of people find him very interesting anymore. So the movie itself takes itself way to seriously and literal. I agree that we should protect our country, and to some extent other countries have a right to do so as well. But also there is a creative balance on how to handle it. You wouldnt want someone coming into your home and trying to change what you believe, but also you wouldnt go terrorize the world to force it down someones throat, or start killing people to prove it. So when you watch the film, you may find yourself extremely confused, i know i did, and i didn't like it.

P.S-bringing up the whole 911 issue by bashing a veiled Arab girl in a class room was just ridiculous, no teacher or school would tolerate such outbursts, no matter what race the child was. Very ludicrous. And yes someone like that should be flagged(Ashley Judd) shame on you for defending such trash.

Here we go again - yet another of those multi-storied social dramas set in the racial and cultural crazy-quilt that is modern-day Los Angeles.  Falling somewhere on the quality scale between the profound ""Grand Canyon"" on the one end and the dreadful ""Crash"" on the other, ""Crossing Over"" relates a half dozen or so interlocking tales centered around the issue of immigration.

Harrison Ford is a compassionate INS agent who goes beyond the call of duty to help an undocumented single mother and her young son; Ashley Judd is an immigration defense attorney who wants to adopt a young African girl who's already spent 23 months in a detention center, the victim of a mountain of bureaucratic red tape; and Melody Khazae is a Muslim high school student whose seeming sympathy for the jihadist cause may make it impossible for her to remain in the country.  And as if to prove that not all targets of immigration policy are ethnic minorities, Alice Eve is a blonde Australian actress who's having a dickens of a time renewing her visitor's visa.  Also in the cast is Ray Liotta as an unprincipled, opportunistic adjudications officer who agrees to smooth over the actress`s visa-renewal problems if she`ll only sleep with him.

Though no one can deny that it starts off with the best of intentions, ""Crossing Over"" leaves much to be desired both as a human drama and as a social document.  In an effort to weave the disparate narrative strands into a coherent whole,  writer/director Wayne Kramer has intercut his scenes with endless birds`-eye-views of the city, a technique that does little to enhance the fluidity of the storytelling.  And despite the best efforts of a dedicated cast, the movie never inspires us to care about the people or issues it`s laying out before us.  In fact, ""Crossing Over"" errs in the opposite direction of the overwrought ""Crash"" by rarely displaying any genuine passion for its subject, seeming instead to be simply going through the motions to make its points.

Perhaps as a result of the limited screen time allotted to each character, no one individual emerges from the pack to engage our sympathy or interest.  The characters feel more like pawns in a polemicist's exercise than fully-rounded people in their own right.  And there's a scene involving a convenience store holdup that is every bit as contrived and credibility-defying as anything in ""Crash.""

But, hey, give ""Crossing Over"" a little credit.  It's the only movie I know of that gives a nod to the Internet Movie Database (known by most of us as imdb).  Surely, it gets some points for that!",1262563200,7,2597,4.868181818181818

With skillful directing, this movie takes us inside the lives of U.S. Immigration agents and several legal and illegal immigrants, telling each of their stories from a unique perspective.  Harrison Ford takes a nice turn as a conflicted immigration agent torn between duty and morality, who sees each immigration story as unique and shows more heart than most of his fellow officers.  What I find most interesting is that this almost semi-documentary script gives us an intimate look into the lives of those on all sides of the immigration debate, and shows us why we need to be a bit more tolerant in our attitudes on a case-by-case basis.  The movie also paints a beautiful picture of the cultural diversity of those who come to this country, and how far some are willing to go in order to remain here.

3797922,4,B001UDS4BS,"Let me say, from the beginning, that I admire Wayne Kramer's remarkable ""Crossing Over"", as a sincere attempt to humanize the real problem of illegal immigration in the United States, and to remind us that many nationalities are a part of the situation, with some immigrants, in our country nearly all their lives, fulfilling all of the obligations of American citizens, except for actually being citizens. For those who see every person illegally here as either enjoying a 'free ride' on law-abiding citizens, or plotting acts of terrorism, I hope this film will open their eyes to the bigger picture.

Saying this, I have to admit that the film isn't entirely successful; in telling so many stories, Kramer is forced to nearly stereotype some characters, and tie up too neatly some of the subplots. While this doesn't hurt the more important plot elements, it does lessen the film's credibility, somewhat. And in only portraying sympathetic immigrants, it does paint an occasionally unflattering picture of the our immigration services, which isn't entirely fair; this is a problem of epic proportions, and the agents trying to enforce the law are not villains with personal agendas, they are simply doing the job they were hired to do.

The multiple storylines involve a veteran agent (Harrison Ford, who was never better), searching to find a young mother he helped deport, to reunite her with her son; a young British atheist (Jim Sturgess), forced to return to his Jewish roots to stay in country on religious grounds; an outspoken Islamic girl (Summer Bishil), threatening her whole family's future by simply saying in a classroom that the 9/11 terrorists had a reason for resorting to violence; a Korean boy (Justin Chon) endangering his family, by gang pressure to join in an armed robbery; an Islamic family, whose son (Cliff Curtis) is Ford's partner, overreacting to their daughter's relationship with a married non-believer;  a successful lawyer (Ashley Judd) hoping to adopt an orphaned African child; and her Immigration Department husband (Ray Liotta, in one of his less-likable roles), 'buying' an young Australian actress (Alice Eve) and her favors, in exchange for a new green card. While the stories have interconnecting characters, they are not locked as firmly together as ""Crash"", and other recent multi-story films, and the Judd subplot gets a bit shortchanged, while the Liotta one occasionally seems little more than an excuse to repeatedly show Eve's exquisite nude body. There are, however, powerful moments in the other storylines, that help offset this.

There should be ONE AND ONLY ONE process by which people (from anywhere) apply for entry into the USA that is FIRM BUT FAIR TO ALL.

Outside of that single process, no other form of entry should be allowed .......... Period.

This film seemed to have the intention and goal of making you feel sympathetic, but instead it was simply an annoying reminder of how soft and stupid we have become in this Western Society when it comes to creating Firm and Fair laws, and then enforcing them without fail.

Now everything is an exception to the rule and slop prevails.

3797926,4,B001UDS4BS,"Well, let me say first that I'm continually disappointed by all the reviewers who have nothing better to do than pour venom on movies that have offended them somehow.  I freely concede that bad movies can and do get made but I question the motivations of reviewers whose level of vitriolic reaction is shockingly disproportional to the actual offense any movie can realistically commit.  Speaking for myself, I'm NOT going to waste readers' time ripping a movie I think is bad; no matter what I say everyone of us is going to have to endure an occasional clinker from time to time, and shouting my angry opinions at you is only going to make me look maladjusted at best.

All of which leads me into my full-throated recommendation of ""Crossing Over"".  Intrigued by the synopsis and cast, I took a chance on this and was powerfully rewarded with an outstanding ensemble drama that ought to provoke all sorts of reflection about our national immigration crisis as well as to stir our own thoughts about just what it means to be an American.

First, GREAT performances by both the stars and the unknowns sharing the screen here.  Harrison Ford is appropriately bedraggled and exhausted as a seen-it-all ICE officer whose conscience forces him to look beyond his enforcer duties and try to ameliorate at least some of the human damage his job inflicts.  Check out how he's got his ""Blade Runner"" square scotch glass back in a similar alone-at-home scene, examining both case history evidence as well as his own moral compass.  Ashley Judd & Ray Liotta are as sharp as ever, portraying a husband/wife on opposite ends of the immigration spectrum: Ashley as an immigration attorney, struggling to help families at the mercy of the Federal immigration sausage grinder, and Ray as a jaded & corrupt bureaucrat sinking to his personal lowest as a bent cog in that very system.  Anchored by these seasoned pros, the rest of the cast dials into their frequency, powerfully depicting the endless sour treadmill of immigration cat-and-mouse as a tragedy diminishing the humanity of all trapped within its jaws.

So many things grabbed me in ""Crossing Over""; first was the dilemma of the illegal Saudi teenager who put her entire family at risk by provoking her high school class with an unbelievably inflammatory speech.  YES she should have known better, but I almost immediately thought (and this was surely the directors' intent) ""it is just the nature of teenagers to say and do risky, ill-considered things"".  Here we are challenged by the outrageously disproportional official response: would we approve of such a bare-knuckled official smackdown of a native kid who (for example) dropped a cherry bomb into the school's plumbing, or spray painted a swastika?  Is it ""justice"" or is it brutish tyranny to respond so vindictively to teenage provocation like this?

I must also comment quickly on the ""honor killing"" depicted here.  ""Crossing Over"" depicts the problems of assimilation vividly through conflict boiling beneath the surface of an outwardly ""model"" Iranian family on the verge of naturalization.  Children raised and grown to maturity here are going to be imprinted with values and cultural ""frames"" vastly different from those their parents (or elder siblings) were born into.  It's an understatement to say that this will provoke intense generational conflict, and while these tensions(thankfully) seldom lead to murder, unfortunately such things are not impossible or unprecedented.  Here again, outstanding ensemble acting dramatizes the conflict and its causes very effectively, sketching all perspectives without artificially tugging our sympathies one way or another.

Implicit throughout ""Crossing Over"" is the question ""what does it MEAN to be an American-a US Citizen-when so many outside our country are prepared to risk so much to live in the shadows among us, where they can all too easily find themselves targets of the nation they gambled EVERYTHING to be part of?""  Obviously this is and should be a penetrating cause for self-examination on all possible fronts for each of us lucky enough to be Americans by birth.  How DO the ideals our nation was founded on perpetuate and express themselves when challenged by outsiders who aspire to those same yearnings?  No easy answers but you simply cannot see ""Crossing Over"" without these dilemmas tugging at your personal sense of who you are and what you contribute to our nation.

It's fair to say that ""Crossing Over"" indeed owes a great deal in many respects to predecessors like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amores-Perros/dp/B00005N8A9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amores Perros</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21-Grams/dp/B0001CNRRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21 Grams</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traffic/dp/B000067IZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traffic</a>"".  However, each of those was a great, absorbing, and important cinematic work of art in every meaningful sense.  Despite its stylistic similarities, I don't think ""Crossing Over"" should be diminished by comparison; indeed, if you haven't already, see all of them.

""Crossing Over"" never really had a fair chance in theaters to find an audience.  I hope my praise can lead a few receptive readers to take a chance and be as amazed as I was by this arresting and consequential film.",1249171200,3,5615,5.6063829787234045
3797927,5,B001UDS4BS,"This film presents several interwoven stories of people who seek documented status in the U.S. There's a Mexican woman who is forced to leave her young son behind in California when she is deported. There are two undocumented young lovers who try to manipulate the system as they pursue entertainment careers. Another story concerns an Iranian man who has nearly attained naturalized citizenship, but is alarmed at his U.S. born daughter's rejection of traditional Islamic culture. Melody Khazae shines as the daughter.

Other characters include an undocumented high school student who defends (or does she?) the 911 attack and thus falls under the scrutiny of immigration officials. A Korean teenager hooks up with a street gang on the eve of his naturalization ceremony.

Harrison Ford ably portrays a compassionate ICE officer who tries to help the Mexican woman and her son. Ray Liotta is very effective as a slimy immigration official who extorts sexual favors from a young woman who is hungry for a green card. Perhaps the most touching performance is that of Cliff Curtis, who plays Harrison Ford's ICE partner, in a dramatic confrontation with the aforementioned Korean youth during a liquor store robbery.

There is a lot here. Some reviewers have said there is just too much. I respectfully disagree.",1248998400,,1310,5.140845070422535
3797928,4,B001UDS4BS,"I viewed Crossing Over in 2008 as part of a test audience. In an age of popcorn action films and dopey comedies, I found the film to be very moving, human and tragic. It is well acted and directed and kept me interested in the many intertwining personal stories of immigration. Those of us living in So Cal equate the immigration issue as being solely Hispanic. But in Crossing Over, we see a broad spectrum encompassing many different nationalities and ethnicities.
I just skimmed through the DVD and was puzzled to see the Sean Penn sequence missing. WTF?  While I missed the sequence, I wouldn't say that it was especially integral to the story. Penn plays a Border Patrol agent driving his truck in the rain when he swerves to avoid hitting a woman who appears out of nowhere. His truck goes rolling down the hillside. He awakes the next morning with a raging headache and stumbles upon the dead woman's body. It turns out she has been dead for a while and the woman he saw the night before was actually her apparition - she had been deported earlier in the film and was apparently on her way back to her son in LA. The sequence is less than ten minutes and Penn did not appear elsewhere in the film.
The Penn scene was replaced by some anonymous Border Patrol agent finding the dead woman's body. Much less moving and thoughtful. I thought it added a nice spiritual dimension to the film. What a brat for asking to be removed from the film. Is Hollywood really that spoiled?",1248134400,14,1479,4.4981412639405205

3797930,4,B001UDS4BS,"CROSSING OVER reminds me of Babel but in a more down to earth way.  With 5 intersecting storylines colliding and converging in this piece, it's no easy task to juggle them all, and director Wayne Kramer does an excellent job.  It's hard to not compare this to other films of similar ilk, but CROSSING OVER definitely stands on its own.  Throw in a bit of Steve Soderbergh's Traffic as well - it must be the LA heat and Mexican border! - and you have a gritty if sobering drama to watch.

This is the kind of role that Harrison Ford excels in.  He's serious as an immigration agent but appropriately so.  The entire cast works very well - from Ashley Judd to Ray Liotta to Jim Sturgess to Cliff Curtis and  blonde Aussie newcomer? Alice Eve - who looks like Reese Witherspoon stacked on a supermodel's body.

The film weaves in a little Hollywood police thriller riff - unlike Babel or even Traffic - which grounds CROSSING OVER in a certain formula - and somehow, justice gets served Hollywood style at the end.  But the larger issues and harsher realities of being American, seeking identity and the world today, still come across by the film's open ended conclusion.

PS - SEAN PENN DOES NOT APPEAR IN THIS FILM.  THIS IS A MISTAKE IN THE CREDITS.",1247270400,10,1249,4.506666666666667
3797931,5,B001UDS4BS,"Honestly, the only reason I rented this movie was because it starred Harrison Ford, and I expected the usual from him. It turned out to be so much more, and though Ford does a good job in his role, it was the ensemble cast that delivered incredibly moving performances.

Harrison Ford plays LA-based ICE agent Max Brogan whose job entails carrying out raids on places that employ undocumented aliens. In contrast to the demands of his job in pursuing and capturing the illegals, Max has a soft heart, following up on those illegals that he captures, especially in special cases. One such case involves a young Mexican alien [Alice Braga] who upon arrest, begs Max to check up on her young son, left in the care of a ruthless money-minded woman. Max refuses her, but later his conscience gets the better of him and he gets the boy back to his grandparents in Mexico, only to find the mother has gone missing.

This is one of the many story arcs that fuse this complex movie together, ala Crash, Traffic, Babel etc, but never throughout the movie, did I find this confusing. In fact, the story arcs all come together eventually, and the result is one gripping, emotionally powerful movie. There is the story of a Korean family where the eldest son is facing an identity crisis of sorts, soon to be naturalized yet not really appreciating its significance, much to his father's disappointment. There's the British Jewish guy who aspires to be a singer but finds himself desperate to get legal status, resorting to working in a Jewish school though he considers himself an atheist. There's the young Aussie actress [Alice Eve] hoping to make it big in America, but overstaying her visit, and finding herself at the mercy of an unscrupulous immigration adjudicator [Ray Liotta in yet another sleazeball role]. Ashley Judd [also playing Liotta's clueless wife] plays a compassionate immigration attorney who expends all her efforts helping those who need her services. One such person is 15-year-old Taslima, a Muslim girl [Summer Bishil of ""Towelhead"" delivering an emotionally gut-wrenching performance] who is taken into custody by the Feds because of a controversial paper she wrote in school about the 9/11 suicide bombers, a paper that sympathizes with the courage [though not the motives] of the killers. Being an undocumented alien, she and her undocumented parents face imminent deportation, leaving her family's future uncertain.

And finally, there's another story arc that deals with an Iranian American woman who faces the disapproval of her conservative family over her overly Westernized way of life. She also happens to be Max's partner's sister, and when she is found murdered, other facts come to light which causes Max to question his partner's motives.

It may appear that there are too many story arcs here to merit sufficient development or characterization, but I found the stories were well-told, the characters as played by the actors were credibly developed and portrayed and the stories eventually blended well together, engaging my attention on an intellectual and emotional level. There are no absolute happy endings here, but a mixture of pleasing outcomes together with the tragic. It is one of the most riveting, thought-provoking dramas I've seen this year.",1246579200,4,3284,5.053505535055351
3797932,4,B001UDS4BS,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Everybody seems to want to live in the USA
2. Harrison Ford plays an ICE Agent whose job is to seek out illegal immigrants.
3. His major problem is that he has a heart, and sometimes gets deeper into busts than he should.
4. Seemingly different storylines somehow get tied together in the end.
5. It seems that there are no happy endings for illegal immigrants, and those who aid and abet them.

A tired looking Harry Ford leads the pack of gifted actors in this surprisingly gripping movie, which will leave you with every emotion except bored.

Supporting roles are played by Ashley Judd, Ray Liotta, Cliff Curtis, Jim Sturgess and Alice Eve, and there are several scenes which will leave a bad taste in your mouth and some that will break your heart.

This is a movie you may have overlooked, but shouldn't miss as a rental.

3797933,2,B001UDS4BS,"CROSSING OVER (2009) covers a lot of the same terrain as
THE BORDER (1982) but is a lot more self-pitying,
microcosm-focused, introverted and ideological.

There are shift in populations to cities that are
prosperous, with modern economies, with systems that work,
allowing people to achieve financial and personal
successes, with all the struggles, hardships, complexities
inherent in the process.

The film tells stories of anguish, worry, financial and
legal struggles of those starting new lives.

Harrison Ford lends his name to the picture, as does
Ashley Judd (in a new mature acting role), both
representing traditional America in face of an
overwhelmingly multicultural influx of newcomers.

The story centers around the ""ICE"" - Immigration and
Customs Enforcement, that is  shown busting alien worker
clothing sewing mills, processing documentation claims,
seizing false ID's, monitoring the land border, setting up
separated children in foster homes.

The multi-cultural aspect is underlined, with the Arab
psychological, cultural and sociological divide, upholding
family honor and reputation, housing of modest means, the
extent to which the political landscape in which one is
born and raised simply will overwhelms one's own identity
in another land, paradoxically, unchangeably.  Values,
norms, mores of behavior in America are simply not the
same.

There is graft, gang activity, tourist visas and
regulations of all sort mentioned.

The script expends extra effort in suggesting that there
are breaches in the system, applicants sometimes get lucky
from the willingness of strangers to assist others in
breaching the rules or laws on compassionate grounds. In
other cases, this is by personal influence, or from the
quid-pro-quo of papers for intimacy, as Ray Liotta's
character demonstrates, with the lovely Alice Eve in
several upper nudity and voyeuristic moments.

The movie underlines the parental and childhood sorrows
and when deportations or separations occur.

For Judd fans, the movie is a reversal of earlier works
featuring her personality, that always have her as a
protagonist as a dynamic young woman. She also reprises
her approach in her pronunciation, which is to never hide
Tennessee or Southern accent.

The movie is well filmed, wide-screen, with a valid sound
track, that is well measured.",1246060800,5,2329,5.529577464788733
