7813507,1,6301654366,"Apparently most or all the sellers of this ""Movie Maker"" are actually offering the 1987 version, a comedy starring Zsa Zsa Gabor & David Hedison, directed by Jim Wilson.  When I asked several of the sellers  to check, they discovered they DO NOT in fact have what Amazon indicates they have, after all!  I.e., the sellers DO NOT have the 1964 version of ""Movie Maker,"" a serious drama with Dabney Coleman & Rod Steiger, directed by Joseph Lejtes! -- Prof Steven P Hill, Cinema Studies, University of Illinois.",1120780800,6,509,4.761363636363637
