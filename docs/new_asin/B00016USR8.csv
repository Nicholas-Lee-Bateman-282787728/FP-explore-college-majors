1975026,5,B00016USR8,"I have had this a while, but haven't used it since it's so easy, it's boring. Therefore, I only use it when I'm not feeling well.
Recently I had a severe allergic reaction & used this. I have been using herbs & acupuncture, but I really felt so much better faster using this to build up my energy. Even when I was very dizzy & felt horrible, I went very slowly on the standing exercises & felt much better after, more energy deep down & was able to fall asleep faster then I had in days.
The sitting ones are even more easy for those who cannot stand.
In the demonstration/how-to area, there is an English or American narrator while they show a clip of Dr. Yang doing the exercises a few times. In another section, the practice is Dr. Yang shows you the complete exercises about 3-20x each which only takes about 10-15 min. Unfortunately on mine, in this section, the sound seems to be faster/off by 3-5 full seconds.
Like almost all Qi Gong videos, they all say once you start, you must complete it & I always do a return to chi motion.
There are A LOT of extras. There is a nice amount of lecture about the basics of energy flow & how Qi Gong works. This dvd is almost two hours long, so you are getting your money's worth. Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is one man any serious martial artist I have ever talked to knows & has read about.
There are trailers on his site at ymaa.",1137974400,36,1370,4.232824427480916
1975027,5,B00016USR8,"The DVD is a more expensive than it should be, but it is very thorough.  I like doing the 18-minute standing sequence with Dr. Yang.  It is very relaxing and I feel loosened up.",1137196800,8,177,4.176470588235294
1975028,5,B00016USR8,"An excellent DVD for someone to begin practicing qigong. Easy to learn and beautiful to look at, these exercises are the most effective and popular qigong movements for the last 1,000 years.

 This DVD also has a lot of information on it for someone interested in learning more and going deeper, with a long instructional section with Master Yang, where he explains exactly how and why these qigong exercises work. He goes into great detail explaining the breathing and qi energy, with specific instruction on many skills, such as generating 'guardian qi' to protect your health.

His teaching style is very clear and, balanced with evidence from Western medical society and a lot of historical knowledge, this is the most complete qigong video out there. He shows how to do each move in various ways, depending if you are flexible already or not. Clearly, he is experienced with teaching students of all ages and health levels.

The subtitles are great, the Glossary of Chinese terms pertaining to Chinese qigong is amazing, and the half hour of trailers for other YMAA Tai Chi and Kung Fu videos is inspiring.",1133740800,12,1111,4.8936170212765955
1975029,3,B00016USR8,"At first, I was highly impressed with this DVD. It's absolutely packed with information and bonus materials. It even includes a section of previews for many of Dr. Ming's other instructional videos which must be at least 30 minutes long in itself, and contains such a wide variety of demonstrations of martial arts and chi gung styles, I found it more entertaining than most kung fu movies!

  The instructions for both the sitting and standing sets of this exercise are well-presented. But I strongly recommend buying and reading the supplemental book before getting started.

  Having purchased many Tai Chi and Chi Gung instructional videos over the years, I have to say this is one of the highest quality productions I've ever seen.

  Which is why I'm sad to say that there's a fatal flaw in this production:

  Although the 8 Pieces of Brocade is traditionally meant to be easy to learn for almost any age or condition, the flexibility with which Dr. Ming demonstrates a couple of the movements far exceeds what many people can do safely.

 Unfortunately, he doesn't offer any ""beginner level"" advice if you are not able to follow along with him. As he bends from the waist and easily grabs his toes, I would find myself struggling along, wondering if the movement still ""counts"" if I can only reach my shins...

  I decided to ask for advice by posting a question in the ""Qigong"" section of Dr. Ming's website forum and still have not recieved an answer after almost 3 months of waiting. So no help there either...

 I finally answered my own question by finding another instructional video for the 8 Pieces of Brocade, presented by a different teacher, who actually takes into consideration people who no longer have the flexibility of a teenager.

  So I must say, knowing that this chi gung form is famous for helping the weak and elderly to regain their health, vitality, and flexibility, and with all the wonderful extra's and quality information available in this DVD, I can't figure out why Dr. Ming never thought to include advice for people who happen to be weak, elderly, or inflexible. There's no help for this in the book either. The way it's presented, you can either follow along or you can't. There's no inbetween.

  If not for this glaring (and personally frustrating) over-sight, I would have given this DVD 5 stars without hesitation. But as it is, I felt somewhat cheated by what should have been an easy to follow program.

  So, if you're already physically active, practicing Kung-Fu or Yoga, this DVD should be easy to follow and highly beneficial for you.

  But if you have a bad back (like me) or arthritis, or similiar inflexibility, I highly recommend looking for a program that presents these exercises more gently and carefully. That way you can get the full benefits without needlessly endangering yourself.

  Also, the information presented in the book and DVD, while interesting and accurate, may seem confusing to someone who's completely new to energy exercises like Chi Gung, Yoga, or Tai Chi. For folks who are new to this stuff, I recommend first reading books like ""Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body"" by B.K. Frantzis and ""The Way of Energy"" by Master Lam Kam Chuen.",1127260800,233,3218,4.812043795620438

I was able to learn so quickly because of the very informative and clear explanations.  This DVD is a very high quality production and incredibly informative.  After studying it for a week I feel that I know enough about the basics of Chi Kung to teach it to others.  It was great to learn more about the history of Chi Kung also.

1975035,2,B00016USR8,"I should have looked at the dates of this DVD and reviews before I purchased it. Although I've done yoga for years, I'm new to Qigong, and was looking for a good video to get me started. With all the rave reviews, I thought this one would be good.

I'm not pleased with it at all. He doesn't give very detailed instructions on each move, which makes it difficult to know if you are doing it exactly right. The other thing that I didn't like was that he didn't demonstrate how to breathe with the moves. From some other Qigong videos I've watched, I've learned that the breathing is an integral part of the movements. Having done yoga for so long, I'm not having any problems integrating breathing, and would have liked to have been shown that from the start.

Once I am more comfortable with Qigong and want to learn more about the ancient practices, I may come back to this video. In the meantime, I think I'll stick with the Lee Holden videos. I know his version of Qigong is much more Westernized, but the practices are absolutely wonderful and easy to follow, with very detailed instructions on both the movements and the breathing.",1451433600,6,1136,4.509708737864078
1975036,5,B00016USR8,"I started doing these exercises every morning and I really like them! This is a high quality video and he does go through and explain every movement and the reason and benefits for the movement. I saw some people complain a bit about the video not letting you know that some people cannot do all the exercises but he has always said go at your own pace and honestly, for any video or exercise you must go at your own pace and you will never start out being able to be at the exact fitness level as the instructor. I wish I could stretch as much as Dr Yang in the video and go ahead and reach my toes like its nothing but I cannot at this time....that will come in time.",1451260800,6,669,4.075757575757576

I had a radical hysterectomy and am suffering a variety of health problems after 13 years of documenting clergy sex abuse cases against children. As soon as I could stand and walk, I researched qigong instruction and settled on this DVD as the best to begin with. And I was right!. Dr Yang presents two different sets of eight pieces of brocade, one for people who must do them sitting down, and one for people who can stand. The movements are simple and easy, and his slow, relaxed, breath-oriented way of doing them gives you great guidance on how the exercises are actually done.

I did them for two months, and they helped me build up my strength. I still have a long way to go, but I was happy to find I did not have cancer. I am still using TCM as my treatment for PTSD and am able to exercise more vigorously now, but when cold weather begins, I plan to incorporate these exercises into my daily routine again.

I know more about tai chi then qigong. So I was glad to have the oportunity to use this DVD.  It's interesting to learn about the 8 brocades and Dr. Yang is the expert.

1975051,5,B00016USR8,"I like this DVD, it really is great. Very clear, and simple to use.
Read this as:
YES, YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE TEACHER AND DO THE WORKOUTS.
The entire sequences are demonstrated, at a proper pace, complete, without interruption or pause, for you to perform along with Dr. Yang.
There is not much of anything that is not adequately spelled out for you, as far as possible in this kind of format.

The sequences, Seated and Standing, are both carefully explained - explanation and demonstration, movement by movement (or Piece by Piece, if you prefer) with key points made about attention and breathing, and then (get this, any of you who have checked out any other  Qigong or Yoga DVDs or books lately) --
the number of reps IS recommended AND some guidance as to the duration of each exercise and, eventually, the whole routine itself. This is something I have found wanting in many fitness and exercise DVDs I have viewed, especially yoga dvds, where you are shown an asana or flow but not clearly instructed regarding how long to hold poses or whatever. Not very helpful, IMHO. But that is NOT a problem with this DVD.

One note:
Dr. Yang is quite flexible, and many viewers will want to work up to emulating his range of motion and stamina in each form. This should not be a problem, as is not an exercise/health system based on personal aggression, or ""no pain no gain"". This is basic, entry level Qigong, well presented for the beginner, and the primary lessons truly are to RELAX and remember to LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. Perhaps there are alternate styles of Qigong for those of us with various physical challenges, but the Eight Pieces are really a very gentle set done carefully and according to the instructions given here. Altering the postures and alignments in any way, as some teachers are willing to do, may not achieve the same results.
So, listening to my body, I reach for my toes as far as comfortable, as many times as I can, and given time I become more flexible and learn to better relax my back. I found this indicated in the text of the DVD, but some DO need it spelled out perhaps more clearly.
Fair enough. :-)
Get this one anyway.",1426550400,4,2158,4.5424164524421595

1975067,5,B00016USR8,"This book provides a great intro to qigong. It includes the theory, history and principals of two basic but essential qigong sets.

The book describes the Eight Pieces of Brocade in both a basic sitting and standing form; the sitting set just works on the 6 upper limb energy channels through the arms, which would be be good for those with issues standing for long periods of time (or if you decide you want to practice at your desk at work while no one is watching). The standing set works all of the 12 energy channels in the body.

Each exercise also includes directions with photos using arrows or brackets to show movement and direction. I found the exercises fairly intuitive and easy to follow, and each concludes with a discussion explaining which organ in the body the movement is connected to, what part of the body is strengthened or stimulated, etc.

Even though it discusses things at an introductory level, there is a lot of information in this small and Simple Qigong"" book.

1975069,5,B00016USR8,"I have been doing a few simple forms of Qigong I have picked up over the years, but never had a comprehensive understanding of the forms or their purposes. Dr. Yang's DVD gives a great beginner's overview of the standing and sitting brocades, including explanations of forms.  Remembering that these DVDs are for beginners, he gives excellent descriptions and plenty enough material to make a strong start at the practice of Qigong.  He gives the traditional Chinese versions of the poems that accompany the traditional forms, historically used as a type of mnemonic to help people remember the forms and their meaning (what to focus on).  Bluntly, the mnemonic value of traditional Chinese is lost on me; the excessively flowery descriptions coupled with extreme assertions (""cure thousands of illnesses"") carry no hints of the intended information, nor are they an inspiration for me.  One of the reasons I had not done more with Qigong until I got Dr. Yang's DVD was that the teachers I had tried take the flowery and dramatic traditional Chinese and make it even more so.  When I didn't understand I was told I wasn't spiritual enough to understand it, or similar comments.

I am actually very spiritual; it is just that I don't believe ""spiritual"" and ""space cadet"" have to go together. Dr. Yang's explanations a clear and to the point, removing the ""woo-woo"" that many practitioners (at least in the US) try and ascribe to Qigong practice.  I am aware of the energy that Qigong works with; I now have more grounded knowledge of the ""why"" and ""where-for"" on which the practice is based.  Personally I am grateful that Dr. Yang decided to demystify this practice and I only wish I had purchased his DVDs years ago.

I highly recommend this to others like myself who want to do the practice, are pretty much beginners, don't have a readily available teacher who is grounded, and has perhaps come across the types of ""teachers"" that try and tell you that you lack ""spirituality"" or ""correct understanding"" or any of a host of other comments made against folks like me who tend to be a wee bit more analytical than others in this arena of human endeavor.",1375142400,19,2155,4.787061994609164

Even though I watched the demonstration few times already, I still don't remember what I am supposed to do and how to breathe, because ""actual"" (vs.explanation of the exercises) demonstration is silent. Most of the exercises are done with eyes closed. I don't know when it starts, when it ends and what to do, unless I memorised it. Yes, they did explained it all in the beginning and more details in the end, but when one actually follows full length exercises there are no audio support of any kind. The initial explanation includes some information in Chinese, which is a waste of time since DVD addresses to English speaking people. Secondly, I did not like that first, I have to read explanation, then it was voice repeated, then there is a silent full length demonstration and then again more detailed explanation/demonstration, which in my opinion should be at the beginning of DVD. Overall confusing and not easy to follow.",1365552000,4,1138,4.781725888324873

All of his books are written with honesty and depth from personal understanding and from his translations of older Chinese works and research.

I personally recommend this practice and this book to those who are looking to expand their physical exercise program or looking to start practicing a good basic qigong program.

Eight Simple Qigong Exercises For Health: The Eight Pieces of Brocade is one of my favorites in Yang Jwing-Ming's arsenal of ""setting right, what once went wrong"" of the martial art proliferation.  I learned the Ba Duan Jin (8 Brocades) from my brother, who learned it from a lineage of American martial artists, none of whom could answer many of my questions. When Dr. Yang released this work in 2003 he answered nearly all of lingering questions, prompting me to visit him in his studio in Boston the following year.

I am an advocate of Dr. Yang, having recommended his work to hundreds of my own students.  It is a privilege to have this man in the martial art world, a world richer for his willingness to take subject matter to a comprehensive level, all while keeping it simple enough for anyone to understand.",1346803200,2,1003,4.612359550561798

Or give more explanations about each exercise instead of telling you to buy more,when I meet people like this  ,I wonder if they want to help people? I mean do they really care about students or are they more worried about their wallet,the photography its pretty bad too it seems like it was done by a home video camera,I must say I felt a little disappointment.the only good thing I have to say is that he really seems to know kung fu and chi kung,but for 8 exercises standing and 8 sitting I am not willing to invest 34 dollars for this dvd,The most I would pay for a bad quality video like this and bad instruction(for he says you must buy the book to understand better) Is 7 dollars the most.",1346716800,3,1002,4.191709844559585

1975079,4,B00016USR8,"Dr. Yang has written and taught extensively about Qi Gong.  The video on 8 Pieces of Brocade is a great introduction and gives you the true Chinese flavor of the practice.  This is a popular version of Qi Gong. (Each of the steps is described in Chinese with English translation.)  The ""Analysis"" gives good background not only on the form but its purpose, so you get some idea of what the rationale is.  The only issue I had with the ""Analysis"" is some of the camera angles made it hard to see what the Dr. Yang is really doing, but in the ""Demonstration"" it is easier to follow.  One gets not only the ""how"" but the ""why"" through this video.

Dr. Yang provides training for both sitting and standing, so even if you are not able to do standing exercise, you can benefit from the sitting practice.

Qi Gong, for those who don't know, comes in many forms and practices.  This is only one. You can spend a lifetime (and many do) working on various forms and practices.  Because it is an ancient practice, passed down through 100's of years, it has taken on many variations. Some are based on helping warriors prepare for or heal after battle.  Some are drawn from watching how animals move in their environment. All are geared to moving ""Qi"" or ""Chi"" -- the energy force the Chinese believe exists within us -- throughout the body.  They believe that free flowing Qi is the basis of good health (mental and physical); when Qi becomes restricted or stagnant, our health is compromised.

The health benefits reported by those who practice Qi Gong are consistently positive.",1340582400,,1570,4.587813620071684

I have been following the instructions for the standing 8 Pieces of Brocade for a few weeks now. Not only do I feel more energized, but my anxiety and asthma have almost completely disappeared. Normally, I used to have a lot of social anxiety, but the exercises have made me so calm that I behave like an entirely different person- a very calm and cheerful person at that!

The exercises also wake me up and give me a lot of energy. I've been able to get more work done than I was getting done before I started.

Perhaps the best part of doing these exercises is that they make me feel calm and happy most of the time. I've been able to be a lot more patient than I used to be because small annoyances are usually less of a big deal to me now.

I'm sure everyone's experience is different when doing these exercises, but I've gotten so much joy out of them that I wanted to share my experience. Perhaps in a year or two I'll update my review, but even after a few weeks this purchase has been worth every penny.

I can tell they put a lot of work into this DVD to make sure it was as detailed and effective as possible.  I was highly impressed.,1287014400,5,484,4.528735632183908
1975089,5,B00016USR8,"I think you'll enjoy this DVD by Dr Yang. He talks about the history of Qi Gong. He's a little hard to understand at times because he's Chinese, but one gets the impression he's very authentic. There are several segments to the DVD, and one of them is a full explanation of how Qi Gong got started thousands of years ago.

There are several segments that explain how to do the sitting and standing exercises in great detail, and what the purpose of the exercise is. Then, there's another segment that has Dr Yang demonstrating the exercise for you. One will find the exercises very easy to do, and he mentions how breathing is extremely important as well. I think he realized that for many people this might be their first experience to this art, so he casually suggests that people practicing these moves concentrate on perfecting the forms, but generally speaking, with any movement that has an arm or leg extension, the individual should exhale. When bringing the arms or leg back, one should inhale, according to Dr Yang.

I'm not a dentist, but there's an exercise where one has to chomp on their teeth multiple times to clear the brain. I think it might be a marvelous way to break some teeth if one isn't careful, so I'd offer a caution on doing this particular exercise.

The rest of the exercises are remarkably easy, and one is left feeling refreshed after doing these brocade exercises. The musical background for the DVD is also very authentic and relaxing.

This DVD shows both a seated and standing version, with detailed instruction. You cannot go wrong by studying anything taught by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming. Always remember to pay attention to the principles and be aware of your own body. Listen to your gut. With practice, your form will flow, but do not force yourself to do everything Dr. Yang does, if you are not ready for it. I have taught taiji and qigong for several years now and can tell you that everyday is different. On some days my fingers are locked from arthritis caused by chemo medications and I cannot make the sword fingers or fist needed in Pull the Bow stance. So I do it with open palm. Some days I can perform the moves exactly like the DVD. My advice is to purchase this DVD, practice every day, and have fun and good health!",1239062400,17,938,4.556213017751479
1975096,4,B00016USR8,"I did a 100 day evaluation of Ba Duan Jin about a year ago. I practiced from an outline that was included in my used copy of this video's companion book. I read the chapters and meditated on translations of the ""songs"". I did both the sitting and standing routines as preparation for Taiji.

At the end of 100 days I took a feel around and didn't notice much difference beyond what I had received previously from Taiji alone. I say ""not much"" because I WAS more limber when bending forward and I WAS able to balance on my toes for longer. Both nice skills but we're not talking chin to toe here.  I stopped and transitioned to standing-post work.

When I was offered the opportunity to review this video I jumped at the chance to revisit the practice.  I'm glad to say that there was valuable information in the video, valuable for me and for at least one other reviewer. I will restate it without risk of spoiling anything.

TAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF!

I don't mean physically. I mean, if you're trying to do the form ""correctly"" let go. Watching Dr. Yang wiggle and shimmy as he stretches makes it clear. This is about your own body, not about ""doing a form"". If you can't reach your toes, learn what you can reach. Ask how it changes from repetition to repetition, day to day, week to week. Learn about yourself. Is the first repetition easier or harder than the last? Do you stop because of pain? Exhaustion? Boredom?  Learn what hurts and don't do that. This is not rocket science and that simplicity and safety is the core of this form.

On the minus side:
Nothing too bad here.

There isn't much on the video versus the book (although the snippets of other videos are fun). Unless you're a collector, I would suggest making a book/DVD decision based on your learning style.  As these movements are pretty simple, if I had to choose over again I would use the book and move at my own speed, sometimes faster and sometimes slower.

This isn't an exercise along video. Although there is a very basic (short) ""do it along with Dr. Yang"" section, once you learn the routine you will want to adjust the number of repetitions and speed to your own needs.

There are also bits of wasted time where Dr. Yang reads the Chinese ""Song"" for each movement. I'm not sure who the target audience for that is.  Perhaps a student of Chinese would enjoy it. I think these 16 paragraphs would be unfortunate interruptions in the flow of my study. I don't really want to be messing with my fast-forward or my Chinese dictionary when I'm supposed to be learning an exercise routine.

On the whole, the production values are very good and if video works well for you or you want a little extra hand holding this is an excellent way to learn an age old form.",1238976000,23,2740,4.4431137724550895

1975098,5,B00016USR8,"As the title for this review says, I felt this product changed my life.  The clear way that Dr. Yang explained the Qi Gong exercises with clear video footage from multiple angles allowed me to perform the exercise set he prescribed and inspired me to further my research into meditation and internal martial arts.  I'm even tempted now to explore external martial arts.

I had some mild exposure to Qi Gong before receiving this DVD.  Most of my practice in the past revolved around the standing meditation, and was derived from a book lacking anything other than line drawings to go by.  While I realize a teacher is always best, none has ever been accessible to me.  This DVD made a teacher accessible to me in a way that, while not the equal of personal instruction, was sufficient to give me the frame work for growing internally.

The DVD is organized into several videos.  First there is a short history of the set.  Then there is an explanation, with short demonstrations of each position, of the sitting and standing variations.  A longer demonstration of each variation in real time is also available.  Finally there is a section with two 45 minute long lectures describing the theory, both from an Eastern and a Western standpoint, behind the various positions and their applications.  The DVD is very clear and well organized.

I have been practicing for about two weeks now, having worked up to performing the sitting sequence every morning for the past few days.  I feel that every day I have become a little more able to focus, a little more flexible, and had better circulation (both of blood and Qi).  I am very pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone wishing to experiment with a short, reasonably easy (compared to other Qi Gong exercises) Qi Gong set.  Despite being basic, there is great depth and power to this technique, and great room for variation which Dr. Yang explains how to use when appropriate.

I look forward to using this as a stepping stone to further development.",1235865600,13,2016,4.730659025787966

1975100,5,B00016USR8,"Review of Dr. J.M. Yang's ""Eight Simple Qigong exercises for Health: The Eight Pieces of Brocade."" (DVD)

Not possessing a background in Taiji Qigong theory or movements, this DVD was more informational than I expected.  Dr. Yang narrates and discusses what is qi and what is qigong and talks about the life story of the creator, Marshall Yue Fei.

Dr. Yang also discusses the main Qigong purposes of healing, maintaing health, prolonging life, martial arts, and enlightenment.  Dr. Yang then explains the main categories of Wai Dan (External Elixir) and Nei Dan (Internal Elixir). Dr. Yang also mentions Jing (essence), Qi (energy) and Shen (spirit), which can be nurtured through Qigong training.  He states that in order to succeed, ""one needs to regulate the body, mind, breath, Qi and spirit. Only then the benefits which one can reap from training will be reaped.""

Dr. Yang then demonstrates the sitting and standing exercises of ""The Eight Pieces of Brocade,"" and includes the poems and songs used to pass this knowledge down from generation to generation.  The DVD is professionally produced and includes subtitles so that Dr. Yang's message cannot be misunderstood.  My only criticism with viewing the DVD alone is not having the companion book with it to learn from both complementary sources of this fine Chinese healing art.  Five stars.

The two complete sets of exercises (sitting and standing) are demonstrated by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming step by step with easy to understand commentary, and again by Dr. Yang as complete sets.

1975109,5,B00016USR8,"I probably own four or five books on the 8 Pieces of Brocade, a Qigong exercise that at first does not appear to be complex or difficult to learn.  After reading the various books on this exercise I felt that I had a pretty good grasp of how to do the exercises and what to expect.  Watching this DVD was very enlightening and corrected some misconceptions I had about the exercises.  The book by Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming is excellent, but as suggested by the author, using the DVD and the book together is a very effective technique for obtaining accurate and effective results while doing this form.

The DVD offers both the Sitting and Standing versions of the 8 Pieces of Brocade exercise.  Dr. Yang starts off the DVD with a history of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, which was created approximately one thousand years ago.
The 8 Pieces of Brocade is presented in two main sections, the sitting version and the standing version.  First shown is an analysis of the steps in the sitting version.

Throughout this analysis the DVD uses multiple angle shots to display the front, sides and rear of Dr. Yang as he demonstrates each of the movements.  Additionally, the added benefit of sound helps the student to realize for example how hard to tap the teeth, or when to breath in and out.  Even the tapping of the fingers on the back of the skull during one of the exercises helps the student to do the movement correctly by listening to the sound that is made when Dr. Yang demonstrates the movement.

Following a very detailed and clear presentation during the analysis of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, the form is then shown in its entirety.  With the convenient chapter markers available on the DVD, the student can easily follow along whatever section they choose.  The movement to DVD for the YMAA products has made learning much easier by allowing this convenient and instant access to any part of the material.

After the analysis of the sitting form of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, the DVD then presents the analysis of the standing form of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, followed by a continuous demonstration of the form.

The student is then treated to a lecture by Dr. Yang on the 8 Pieces of Brocade.  This lecture is approximately 50 minutes and has a wealth of information about the form.  Clever use of animation helps to illustrate the flow of chi that occurs while doing the form.

In my opinion, the way to learn martial arts successfully is to employ the following tools:

Instruction from a teacher

Studying printed material

Visualization in your mind

Self practice and study while doing the forms

Writing a journal to record what is learned or taught during each lesson
Watching videos of the teacher

Filming yourself and comparing it to the image you had in your mind of how you were doing the form

Socialize and share your knowledge with other students and work on the principles together

Try teaching one of the concepts, moves, techniques or applications to a person who has no knowledge of Taijiquan.  In the process you will easily learn as much as the person you are trying to teach.

This DVD is one of the above mentioned tools, and a wonderful addition for the serious student to learn and practice properly the 8 Pieces of Brocade.",1160956800,71,3247,4.62129144851658
1975110,5,B00016USR8,"This DVD lives up to its promises - it introduces you to the world of Qigong. I have personally practised some Qigong exercises before  - from some books - but after watching this DVD I realized that I was doing them somewhat wrong. I didn't see any of what I had been practising in this video, however, doing Qigong is like a poem (actually, it was a poem for ancient Chinese), like a moving meditation, it's soft and smooth, whereas I had a rigid and strict execution. This DVD presents two sets of exercises - sitting (on a bed, let's say) for elderly and weak people, and standing - for everyone else. There is a track presenting the history of Qigong, specifically this set, and detailed explanations of each exercise, including medical benefits (e.g. what internal organ you would be massaging by doing them). Granted, you need more information (e.g.on breathing - it is only briefly touched), but then again, a beginner could only get so much or else (s)he becomes scared of so many new things. Still, Dr. Yang has a book with the same title, I've ordered and received mine (but haven't started reading it yet), that should explain more things. The book and the video complement each other - the former has more information, but the latter shows you the execution. Get them both.

I'm also a beginner, and have no teacher, but apparently, looking at customer reviews for Qigong beginners, this is the course path that I recommend (that is what I am going to order and study, even if I get a teacher in the meantime):

- Stick to 8 Pieces of Brocade until you execute it well, and by that I mean not only physical execution - which you will probably get soon, it's very simple, but also mental - you master it when you are able to focus on it from beginning to end, or sort of.

- Get ""Chi Kung: The Way of healing"" by Master Lam Kam Chuen, those exercises should prepare you for the next stage

- Get ""Chi Kung: The Way of energy"" by Master Lam Kam Chuen and ""Opening the energy gates of your body"" by Bruce Frantzis Kumar, those books complement each other. Note that apparently all the exercise in ""Way of healing"" are actually easier selections from ""Way of energy"", so don't be surprised. I guess, because of this you could skip the ""Way of healing"" phase completely.

When all the above is done - you should have greatly improved your energetics, but it could take years or even a lifetime without a teacher. You are then ready to study Dr. Yang's other books - I won't write the relevant ones here (although I had started too, but removed the paragraph), by then you should know which they are, they don't belong in this beginner's review. Anyway, at that stage you should probably get a teacher.

In short, this is a nice beginner's introduction, short of having a teacher. Did I mention to get a teacher?",1142899200,58,2819,4.515686274509804
1975111,5,B00016USR8,I highly reccommend this DVD for interested beginners and experienced Martial Arts practitioners alike who wish to learn a set of Qigong exercises designed to improve health. The DVD is thoughtfully produced and has a lot of interesting background and historical information. A novice will be able to learn a complete set of breathing and movement exercises in a very short time.,1140652800,21,379,5.129032258064516
8007298,5,B00016USR8,Very useful.  It has a sitting and a standing routine.  It is a little difficult to navigate through.  The sitting routine is ideal for calming the mind and energizing the body when energy levels are low.,1521936000,,204,4.611111111111111
8007299,5,B00016USR8,Superbly explained by the Master!,1516579200,,33,5.8
8007300,5,B00016USR8,It was quite enlightening.  Dr Yang Jwing-Ming gives a history of how this style came to be and how long it has been around.  The instructions were wonderful.  What I didn't like was the fact that it made me realize how out of shape I have become!  I've got a lot of work ahead of me : (,1513987200,,287,3.896551724137931
