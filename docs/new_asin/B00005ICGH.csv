7938375,4,B00005ICGH,A cool to the point kayak doc done in early 00's Basically same movie as nurpu adrinline series slightly shorter with different music and 10% different film the editing in parts is better in this vocals over music!

7938378,5,B00005ICGH,"Great action, high quality picture, spectacular footage.  Could have substituted some of the hippie stuff for more paddling action. I can go to the park and watch people meditate and play footbag for free.  Overall Nurpu is an extremely well done film with fairly continuous action coupled with a good soundtrack.",1021420800,3,313,5.117647058823529
