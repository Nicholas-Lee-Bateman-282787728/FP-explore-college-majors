8353593,1,B0026RW2FG,"I only purchased these DVDs for the one that covers counting. I was shocked and disappointed to see that they only counted to number 5 and then they danced and started talking about other things for the rest of the segment. I couldn't believe it. Stick to the subject Mr. Puppy Dog! :) Also, Jack falls down like a bazillion times in the counting video, almost as if he has equilibrium is off. Haha It's not that funny and repetitive. I'm only keeping the DVDs because my 2 year old watches them in the morning while he's getting dressed for daycare and he likes them.",1519344000,,568,4.419047619047619

8353598,5,B0026RW2FG,"My 21 month old LOVES the Puppy Dog videos, with exception to the baseball one which seems to be geared towards slightly older kids, he's got NO interest in that. He's enjoyed these for a couple of months now. They are annoying, but my little one loves it and begs for it constantly so I have to give it a good review. I also have to admit I do think it has helped with his speech. These videos are clearly for YOUNG CHILDREN who are in the process of just learning to talk. My son is under 2, but he talks constantly, so he is at the right age for this. If not trying to talk, they may be bored, and a child who already speaks very well will probably be EXTREMELY bored. Keep this in mind when deciding if this video is for you. Oh, and the reason they are boring is they are EXTREMELY repetitive (especially the music), very slow speaking parts, and some of the running jokes (a boy falls down out of nowhere for no good reason ALL the time) can get extremely old and don't seem funny at all to an adult...and yes my son does now mimic the ""falling down boy"" all the time which I'm not crazy about, but all in all the video is harmless and will help a young child learn to talk so I am happy to have them.",1311638400,,1207,4.054393305439331
