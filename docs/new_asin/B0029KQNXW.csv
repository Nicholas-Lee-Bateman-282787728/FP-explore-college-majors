8382889,1,B0029KQNXW,Worst than ANY of the 9 Seasons! Not closure to Season 9 and a waste of time.,1503273600,,77,3.588235294117647
8382890,3,B0029KQNXW,"Such as shame that such an iconic series was left with so many cliffhangers. I've gotten inside information from 2 castmembers ( i used to have a radio show and interview soap stars), who told me the story about the cancellation. ABC had a relatively new network president and wanted to throw his weight around. He felt that Aaron Spelling had a little too much power at the network (not surprising, considering he had made 100's of millions, if not billions of dollars with decades of hit show after hit show). So, he led them all to believe that the show would have one final season, at least 13 more episodes to begin airing mid-season to wrap things up. I guess according to SAG rules, any current show must be cancelled by a certain date, and the network literally waited until the last second. Everyone was all set to go back to work. Ironically, it cost them more to do this equivalent of 4 episodes 1 1/2 years later due to the onslaught on letter and phone calls they got from outraged fans. It was extremely short-sighted. Had they marked it well, airing commercials starting in september, ""Dynasty: the final season,"" the ratings probably would've gone up. AND, they lost Aaron Spelling, arguably the most successful executive producer in television history. This reunion was the last thing he ever did for ABC. Too bad the Colbys, and the bad writing in Season 7, as well as the DREADFUL Amanda recast had much to do with the HUGE dip in the rating in seasons 8 and 9, which were actually much better. Anyway. Gordon Thomson (yes, one of my sources, but I can divulge since he told me in public), was willing to do the reunion, but was under contract to NBC at the time and just needed a very slight shift in the shooting schedule. ABC refused. There are some aspects of this reunion that could've been implemented into a season 10 to trim the budget, but with better writing, and less cheesy, trite, contrived storylines. And what the hell happened to Sammy Jo? The script was written by the Shapiros, but it was if they were writing her pre mid-season 5. And the whole Steven and Blake having to come to terms with his sexuality AGAIN? And the Fallon/Jeff/Miles triangle? At first, Kirby made no sense to me, but, Dynasty always did foreshadow a character's return, and they did mention her quite a lot in season 8, so i guess i can wrap my head around that one. Had the same basic story outline been spread out over 10-13 episodes with more attention paid to the evolvement of the characters (and the foreshadowing in season 9 made it apparent Dominique was coming back), and if it were less forced and contrived, then i think we could've had a better ending to one of the greatest, most gound-breaking, and under-apprecidated shows of all time. BTW...watch the show on amazon prime video. the new releases are much better quality than the last ones.",1497744000,4,2865,4.59765625
8382891,4,B0029KQNXW,"This season had some interesting episodes.  The fashions were impressive and you see some of this stuff making a come back with today's designers.  Blake is always being attack, and I believe it was this season it seemed he was going under with no hope. Buy it you will enjoy the drama if you are a Dynasty junky.",1409875200,,313,4.379310344827586
8382892,3,B0029KQNXW,"Sadly, although the Mini Series itself is good and complete, there does not seem to have been a general release DVD for Dynasty the Reunion and this DVD has a poor quality picture that has obviously been recorded from TV or from the VHS release.  However, at present, this is the only way I know to complete the Dynasty collection on DVD, so it is eventually a choice of having poor quality or nothing.  If you want Dynasty the Reunion on DVD then this is the only game in town.",1368489600,26,478,4.3
