4982422,1,B006BZ8O56,"I was hoping for a amateur remake of transformers with a personal twist but the movie sucked.
Would not suggest watching it. I just brought it because the trailer looked interesting.",1331769600,,182,4.903225806451613
4982423,1,B006BZ8O56,"Sorry, Amazon, but your movie-making ability isn't as good as your movie-delivery. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and constantly wanted to just say ""to heck with it"" and turn it off. $14.99 for this? I got taken. For your own sake, don't bother purchasing this nonsensical piece of tripe.",1330560000,4,306,4.7924528301886795
4982424,4,B006BZ8O56,"While two brothers are considering the sorry state of their finances, out of the blue pieces of a destroyed Soviet satellite crash onto the property of an Idaho farmer.  The brothers arrive too late to save the poor farmer but, being mercenary and in need of some fast cash, finders keepers, they sell the scrap to a local junkman (the incomparable Donnelly Rhodes).  As it would happen, the junkman was building what he calls an Iron Golem for the town's upcoming centennial.  Some hitchhiking bacteria from the Soviet scraps glom onto this Golem and off it goes, out for blood.
I'm almost embarrassed to say I liked this dopey movie (first seen on the SyFy Channel).  It helped that one of my favorite actors was in it (the aforementioned Donnelly Rhodes).  The special effects were anything but special (although I did like the scenes where the pieces of junk were crawling around on their own).  What impressed me though was how compact the idea was and just how much they achieved with a limited cast (just 13 people) and a limited location (few structures were involved and just a couple of vehicles).  It wasn't until I saw an apartment complex in the background of one scene that I considered the oddity of no passersby, no pedestrians, no extras whatsoever; just the 13 people involved.  What are the odds of that?
If I had to name one thing that really bugged me it's the crappy title.  Apparently, the original title was Iron Invader (the working title seems to be Iron Golem); either of these would have been better.  Metal Shifters is a bit misleading, it sounds as if there were an army of these things and not just one that spent a great deal of the movie in pieces.

At any rate, I liked it and I'm keeping it for future viewing pleasure (the perfect movie for a double feature night).",1330560000,6,1801,4.596875
4982425,3,B006BZ8O56,"A likeable Canadian flick that takes one back to the old time monster movies where characters and story reign over special effects.

A small town, I believe in Idaho, is besieged by an alien, symbiotic concoction: a soviet satellite infested with a slimy bug that crashes in their backyard.  It likes metal and blood and transforms itself into a giant robot-like killer.  Bit by bit, the limited town folk are getting knocked off as they come to the realization that they alone must fiqure out a way of destroying it.

Like movies of the 1950's, the filmmakers stress the interactions between the actors versus state of the art special effects.  The effects they use are adequate, and they work them more with scary music, darkness, and foreboding camera angles.  The actors do their work for this type of genre, more subdued and realistic than overly campy and in one's face, and the movie, by and large, is well done.

There's little actual gore or language, no sex, and like the old time movies, one goes along trying to fiqure what one should or would do next.  It doesn't have the humor or, I think, the fun of the original ""Tremors"", but it's an OK addition to one's late night movie time.",1329091200,4,1195,4.630331753554502

4982429,5,B006BZ8O56,"If only there were more clean sci fi movies like these.  Pretty good character development, ridiculous story line, and so-so special effects, but all in all, an entertaining film.",1397347200,,179,5.172413793103448
4982430,5,B006BZ8O56,Alien bacteria feed on metal and manipulate it. They colonize a giant metal golem statue and it starts moving and attacking people. The effects for the moving statue are quite impressive for being low-budget. It's an interesting movie and sci-fi fans should give it a shot.,1365724800,,273,4.956521739130435
4982431,3,B006BZ8O56,"cheesy, but entertaining. enjoyed the movie overall, my wife loved it
, which is odd, because she usually hates the sci-fi and horror that I love.",1360886400,,146,4.653846153846154
4982432,2,B006BZ8O56,"The small town of Redeemer is in for big trouble when a Russian satellite comes crashing to Earth with a deadly bacteria on board. The space virus infects a large metal sculpture, transforming it into a giant killing machine! METAL SHIFTERS concocts one harebrained plot contrivance after another in a film that is spilling over with cheap genre cliches. The characters are expectantly bland, but none more so than the indescript action sequences, where the robotic terror does little more than sap the townspeople of their life rather than going on a destructive rampage. At most, it breaks through a couple of windows before being obliterated. The computerized effects that bring the creature to life truly aren't bad for a film of its size, and they are mostly concealed in darkness to hide any malformities. METAL SHIFTERS is just more mindless fodder for a Saturday afternoon.

I did not expect much, and we did not get much,

Now an alien bacterium that transforms steel objects into furious killing machines has infected the local scrapyard. Can a local contractor (Kavan Smith of ''Stargate: Atlantis'' and ''The 4400'') and his estranged ex-girlfriend (Nicole de Boer of ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' and CUBE) find a way to stop a heavy metal monster from tearing a path of biological and mechanical destruction through small-town America? Chris Gauthier (''Eureka''), Paul McGillion (''Stargate: Atlantis'') and Donnelly Rhodes (''Battlestar Galactica'') co-star in this SYFY ORIGINAL blast of mayhem from the creators of SNAKEHEAD TERROR, ICE QUAKE, SOLAR ATTACK and STONEHENGE APOCALYPSE!
