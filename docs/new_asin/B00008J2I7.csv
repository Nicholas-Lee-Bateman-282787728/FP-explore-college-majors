1848203,5,B00008J2I7,"EXCELLENT CHOREOGRAPHY IN THIS PRENATAL WORKOUT VIDEO...THE INSTRUCTOR LEISA IS VERY PREGNANT, I BELIEVE NINE MONTHS, AND SHE VERY POWERFULLY LEADS A GROUP OF OTHER PREGNANT WOMEN THORUGH A SALSA DANCE ROUTINE THAT WAS 20 MINUTES AND NOT COMPLICATED, THEN A YOGA FAT BURN THAT TONED THE BODY(MAINLY THE HIPS AND THIGHS AND BUTTIE) WITHOUT ANY SPIRTITUAL MUMBOJUMBO AND THEN SHE DID TWO REALLY NICE SEGMENTS ON LABOR AND DELIVERY PREP AND THEN A STRETCH/RELAX SEGEMENT. ALL IN ALL, THIS VIDEO WAS FLAWLESS. THE MUSIC WAS GOOD, AND THE OTHER 4 WOMEN OR THE CAST WERE COMPRISED OF FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, AND ANY MOVES THAT WARRANTED IT WERE MODIFIED FOR YOU, WHICH WAS HELPFUL, YET NOT OVERLY TALKED. THE INSTRUCTOR DID NOT OVER TALK OR OVER STATE ANYTHING, SHE WAS IMPECCABLE IN HER CUEING OF THE MOVES, WHICH MADE THE DANCING VERY EASY. I REVIEW LOTS OF VIDEOS FOR MAGAZINES, AND NOT MANY, MAYBE 1 PERCENT OF THEM, DESERVE 5 STARS, AND FITMAMA GETS MY VOTE FOR BEING A 5 STAR WORKOUT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. MY BABY WILL BE ENJOYING THE MOVES WITH ME AS I AM ONLY 7 WEEKS PREGNANT, SO I WAS GLAD TO REVIEW THIS FOR ANYONE CONSIDERING A PRENATAL FITNESS PROGRAM, I RECOMMEND IT.",1046995200,44,1185,4.647619047619048
1848204,5,B00008J2I7,"it's one thing to workout, sweat, and still be fat and pregnant, but it's another thing to workout and feel really good about yourself when your done...I loved this workout, FitMama, the instructor Leisa Hart was great, I had never heard of her, but it turns out she's a video pro, I'm gonna try some of her other videos as soon as I deliver, she was great, and this video was 60 minutes of great stuff.",1046995200,6,403,4.315789473684211
1848205,5,B00008J2I7,"i've tried most of them, and this is the best, well, i know this is the best cause I've done almost all of the them at amazon, i want her Buns of Steel after I'm 8 months pregnanct, Leisa looked great.,,Fitmama is so cute a title, but an even better workout for my pregnated body.",1046995200,4,280,4.109090909090909
1848206,5,B00008J2I7,"this was fun, considering that fun isn't easy to achieve when you're 60 pounds heavier than normal, but my doctor told me if I didn't do something more than walk to the frig than I'd regret it later...well, she's been right about everything during my first two pregnancies, so enough of the hormonal blues, I'm gonna stick with it...I've found Leisa Hart to be great in hers Buns of Steel videos, so I gave this video a try(along with 3 others), and it is by far easily the best...the other three(Rocki's, the Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rhea, and Denise Austins) were pretty much terrible, but hey, I'm hormonal, I can pick my favorites and tell others, cause that's what us pregnant women can do...",1046995200,4,697,4.629032258064516
1848207,5,B00008J2I7,"my butt was ready for a good workout now that I', 14 weeks pregnant, and i got more than that after doing the Buns of Steel girls pregnancy video FitMama...my hips, thighs and abs were also really worked, it was challenging yet is was also easy, if that make sense. You can't beleive how fun combining a good dance routine to salsa music can spice up you day, i loved it...to then do yoga toning, or a ""Yoga Fat Burn"" as its called in the video, was great. I had a great workout, and now, after working out to this vid at least 6 or 7 times, I think I am going to see if I can get a group of other pregnant friends over to my house to do this workout together because it will really help all us maintain some semblance of a fit body for our hubbies, even if we put some baby weight on. Leisa makes you feel good about yourself, and she's very calm and reassuring that our baby is first priority but we have to take care of ourselves to better take care of everyone around us who relies on us. She is phenomenal and I respect her so much more now that I know she's been there done that with two kids, it says alot when a fitness celebrity who has shown her butt to the world can then put on the baby pounds but lose it, and do it over again. It shows that what she's doing works and can work for me. My hubbie now is calling me Fitmama, which is kinda cute(just hope he's not wishing i was leisa hart!...lol). Back to my review, I really liked the stretch and relaxation portion of this routine, it was very good on my bones and muscles, and I think that by doing the different segments of this workout everyday I will have a great pregnancy and a great delivery.",1046995200,16,1662,4.085626911314985
1848208,5,B00008J2I7,"Incredible, that's how I felt after workout out with Leisa Hart the very first time, and now after doing her Fitmama video several times I feel even better about myself and my pregnancy. She incorporates such positive energy into her workout, I loved her style of leading the women throughout the workout and I felt like I was really being talked to by leisa, she is very encouraging and talked about safety during working out and about labor and delivery tips that helped her the first time(she looks incredible during her second pregnancy). It's hard to stay motivated while prego, and Leisa seems to have a knack for saying the right things that women want to hear, she's not annoying or overly perky like a denise austin or richard simmons, she's a tony robbins leader in a christie brinkley or heather locklear body. I really looked up to her when she hosted different infomercials and liked her products, but I really love Fitmama and can't wait to ge to delivery and see how much stronger I will be by doing this great workout.",1046304000,23,1034,4.655737704918033
1848209,5,B00008J2I7,"Great music, great set, great instructor. Loved this 60 minute workout, I can do the Salsa dance if I only have 20 minutes, or I can do the yoga fat burn to tone up for 20 minutes. I loved the two bonus segment, this is very cheap considering you're getting 60 minutes for what most 30 minute videos cost. I loved this workout and hope to try other Leisa hart videos very soon.",1046217600,6,377,4.178082191780822
1848210,5,B00008J2I7,I loved Leisa Hart's Fit Mama!  The different workouts that help keep you feeling good and fit throughout your pregnancy are very much appreciated and keep you coming back for more.,1400544000,,181,4.838709677419355
1848211,5,B00008J2I7,"I got this when I was pregnant with my son in the summer of 2004.  I was healthier the day after my son was born than I was pre-pregnancy!  And even to this day, I still use the dvd as part of my workout collection.  I figure if I can do it up to the day before my son was born, I can do it now, not pregnant!  I do all the workouts at the Stage I level and also do it a little faster to get more reps in.  But this is one workout that I always end up coming back to after a hiatus from exercising!  I do other non-prego workouts, too.  But I know for a fact that this gives results.  The day after my son was born, I was 18 lbs less than my pre-prego weight!!  And this was the only workout I did during pregnancy.  I do the Yoga one more than the Salsa one, and I'm not even a ""yoga"" type person.  Definitely recommend this!",1397779200,,826,3.7719298245614037
1848212,5,B00008J2I7,A fun workout or two!  I generally did either the Yoga or the Salsa and the closing.  I enjoyed it and it kept me fit!,1387065600,,118,3.68
1848213,3,B00008J2I7,Not intense enough. I did it once and it was so easy I didn't do it again. It would be god for someone who needed low impact workouts.,1385424000,,134,3.8214285714285716
1848214,5,B00008J2I7,"I've been working out to this video since my second trimester and I really enjoy it. This is my third pregnancy and this is the only pregnancy I've exercised through. I really believe this workout has helped me feel better during this pregnancy, with fewer body pains. The moves are simple enough for any beginner. I feel better about my pregnant body and also motivated to continue working out after delivery. I fully intend to buy Leisa's postnatal routine. I was working out fairly regularly prior to getting pregnant, so that may have made working out easier for me during this pregnancy.",1383868800,,592,4.813725490196078
1848215,2,B00008J2I7,Wasn't a fan of the workout.  It wasn't difficult enough and was really boring.  Not quite sure why it has high reviews.,1377907200,,120,4.409090909090909
1848216,5,B00008J2I7,I was looking for something that was a little more involved than some of the other prenatal workouts. I feel like I've actually done some exercise after this video.,1376870400,,164,4.689655172413793
1848217,3,B00008J2I7,"The video reminded me of the old workout tapes that my mom used to do. I got this because I was looking for a prenatal yoga routine and there is a very small section on yoga. Not worth it. The other portions of the tape include fake salsa dancing and the ""cha-cha"". It's random workouts like that, that are on the video. If your workout very little this tape is good.",1376092800,,367,4.183098591549296

1848219,3,B00008J2I7,this DVD is boring .it does not raise your heart rate.and don't expect to break a sweat. I guess it would be okay fo for someone new to exercise but not someone who exercised before pregnancy. I am glad I brought it used.,1372032000,,221,4.162790697674419
1848220,2,B00008J2I7,I was running 5ks at 7 months pregnant this was just too slow and not active enough for me this is more for if you are a lighter actvie person.,1368057600,,143,3.8
1848221,5,B00008J2I7,"This is good for getting you back in motion after getting over morning sickness. It has a variety of workouts-dancing, yoga or stretching, and you can do one or more depending on your level. It was well paced for moms trying to gently stay in shape. It's a good supplemental for toning specific areas while pregnant-like your abs.  I've shared it with friends and they want a copy for their own collection.",1367193600,,406,4.638888888888889
1848222,5,B00008J2I7,"I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this workout DVD for 2 months now and love it. It's challenging enough that I sweat and feel proud of myself, but not too difficult that I don't want to do it. I wake up at 5:30am to do the video, by 6:30am I'm done, cooled off and ready to start my day (make my smoothie, shower and go to work).

All other reviews have done a great job of explaining the segments, I'd just like to provide some of the little things I do to make it more challenging.

In the Salsa portion:
The only changes I make is during the squat and shoulder side-to-side move, instead i do pulse wide-stand squats. Then at at the end, after you do the portion when the music has slowed down, I start doing squats/lunges until the break into the Yoga Fat burn section. I switch it up b/t standing squats, and forward and backward lunges. I feel it's not necessary to stretch my calves at this point.

In the Yoga Fat burn portion:
I hold 2 pound weights through this portion except the standing breathing portion when your hands are outstretched above your head and your breathing in and out with your belly.

During the part when you breath standing upright, then squat with your hands on your knees, instead I just do squats with weights balanced on shoulders.
During the part when you are in a knees bent position, hands on knees and curve and roll your back, instead I stand upright, and I do front and side arm raises with weights, alternating side to front.

Then I hold weights out in front during the chair sit portion. Then during the side lunge part, i do bicep curls during the first rep when she's explaining everything. Then, I do tricep extensions with the one arm she wants you to extend to the ceiling when you're lunging on the side.  Then do the over head shoulder press (same as she instructs) with the weights, then I don't break to stretch, I continue to do the front leg lunge with shoulder press until she's done with this section.

And that's it, i make those small changes throughout the video and end up sweating a bit more, and getting in extra leg exercises and some arms, too.

Hope you find that helpful!",1366156800,5,2149,4.381909547738694
1848223,5,B00008J2I7,Amazing DVD. Great for every trimester. Fat burn yoga is fantastic and the salsa section is fun and a nice change from normal workout DVDs.,1362787200,,139,4.6
1848224,5,B00008J2I7,"Leisa's workout DVD is quick, fun, and effective. She is very positive and motivating. The workout isn't too difficult, but provides enough of a challenge to feel you're benefiting your body.",1359504000,,191,5.193548387096774
1848225,4,B00008J2I7,"Its got a bit of everything which is nice.  The only portion that is so so is the ""Salsa"", being Latin I expected something a little more upbeat.  It was still good buy though.",1358208000,,176,4.147058823529412
1848226,4,B00008J2I7,Great workout for my pregnant wife. She loves it and uses it a lot! I would recommend to any pregnant women,1353456000,,107,4.142857142857143
1848227,2,B00008J2I7,"I thought the cardio and yoga sections were overly repetitive.  I finished all four segments in the same session and did not feel as though I had worked out at all (I'm in my early 2nd trimester.)  I didn't breathe heavy or break the slightest sweat during the cardio (or yoga).  I did like the fact that she had 2 ladies in their 1st trimester and 2 ladies in their 2nd trimester to show variations.  However, there were only two moves I remember that required variations.

There are parts where she used a yoga ball and yoga strap, but neither are necessary to complete the workout.  Overall, I was very disappointed by this video.  I checked it out from my local library and was so glad I did because I would've been really upset if I had spent money on it.  I hope to find one that is at least of a medium level intensity.  This was way too light and easy. Also, they keep her mic all the way up during her breathing and her exhaling is so loud that it is very distracting throughout the entirety of the 20 min. cardio and 20 min. yoga segments.",1349049600,,1049,4.257575757575758
1848228,4,B00008J2I7,"This video is very good for the barely pregnant all the way to the very pregnant.  Leisa Hart goes slow enough so you can keep up and pace yourself but you still feel like you have gotten a good workout by the end of the video.  I had some restrictions during my pregnancies which led to me being unable to do most physical activities, but this video was something I could do to keep up my fitness.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a baby on the way!",1325894400,,465,4.144444444444445
1848229,5,B00008J2I7,I bought this dvd when I was pregnant with my 2nd child & have used it during my 3rd & 4th pregnancies as well.  LOVE it!  The workout is the perfect amount of exercise where you still feel great when you're finished.  Highly recommend!,1316131200,,236,4.318181818181818
1848230,5,B00008J2I7,"If you're looking for a prenatal workout video that isn't only yoga, this is a really great one.  I like the 20 minute salsa portion, which is really more like a typical aerobics class that has been toned down for expectant mothers.  Then there's also the 20 minutes of yoga, which is also so great in getting your lungs and mind more prepared for childbirth.  The final two parts - Preparing for Birth, and Stretching/Relaxation are the best I have found in any of the prenatal videos I have tried so far.  She doesn't push, but keeps reminding you to go at your own pace, take breaks as needed, and to listen to what your body is telling you.  I didn't get this video until the start of my third trimester, but I will be sure to use it throughout my 2nd & 3rd trimester the next time around.",1313366400,,793,4.295302013422819
1848231,3,B00008J2I7,"Leisa Hart is definitely energetic and motivating, but I did not enjoy doing this video much while I was pregnant...mainly because I don't like to dance much. She incorporates a couple of dance moves in her cardio section and I felt really silly doing it. But if you enjoy that type of thing then I think this is a great prenatal workout! The stretching and relaxation segment was pretty good. I had bad sciatica during my pregnancy and there's one specific stretch that helped out a lot with it (but I could've done that without the video). Overall, the video was fun the first few times but I got bored with it easily.",1312588800,,620,4.495575221238938
1848232,2,B00008J2I7,"I was super active before I got pregnant & this video was not what I was looking for to help keep me in shape while pregnant.  I didn't break a sweat, let alone felt like I got a work out.  I felt like I got a better workout going on a brisk 2 mile walk around the subdivision.  I would recommend for people who are not active and are looking to start working out while they are pregnant though.",1310169600,,395,3.9746835443037973
1848233,3,B00008J2I7,"The only part of this video i participate in is the salsa dance.  she is an aerobics instructor, not a yoga teacher, and that fact is obvious.

it is annoying when she exhales into her microphone.  that is totally unnecessary and it sounds like she's blowing up a balloon.  luckily, she only does it a few times during the salsa dance, or i probably wouldn't do that either.

I do enjoy the salsa dance workout.  i work up a little sweat but do not feel like she is pushing too hard.  It is great for working out in your third trimester.  easy yet effective.  i feel good after doing it.",1309132800,,587,4.263636363636364
1848234,1,B00008J2I7,"BORING!  First off, the filming and sound are horrible!  Second of all, the workout is terrible.  She teaches you three moves and you repeat those three moves for the entire thing!  I was so bored, and I wanted something that would challenge me and make me want to move.  Add the horrible workout to the poor sound, the bad filming, and the sickly looking people working out with her--no.  I would recommend Kathy Smith's pregnancy workout, or the Perfect Pregnancy workout vol 1 (NOT vol 2!).  I would even recommend Denise Austin's before I recommend this one--and that's saying something.  This is absolutely terrible.  Anyone who is accustomed to doing video workouts would desire more than this video has to offer.",1306454400,,719,4.87603305785124
1848235,3,B00008J2I7,Its OK.  I was doing P90X prior to pregnancy unfortunately I was not able to do any workouts for my first trimester due to severe migraines.  Once my migraines eased up (2nd trimester)I tried this and it just wasn't the right fit for me.  I felt that it wasn't really doing anything for me and I got easily bored.,1303516800,,313,4.271186440677966
1848236,2,B00008J2I7,"I'm 24, 19 weeks pregnant with baby #3. When I am not pregnant I do workout videos and run. This video is way too old school for me. I need something that actually makes me feel like I'm getting a work out and its worth it. I did break a little sweat doing this but I was just hoping for more. I know its not going to be like my other workout videos that I have for non pregnant people but I just think that in this day in age they could come up with some different techniques then just salsa dancing and doing the mamba....",1300924800,,524,3.952830188679245
1848237,5,B00008J2I7,"I bought this DVD during pregnancy to help ward off excessive weight gain.  While I am not overweight, I tend to avoid exercise so I needed something I could stick with.  I have bought a few other DVDs for pregnancy and never did them more than a few times.  This workout I can do just about every day.  It isn't complicated, it's easy to follow, and doesn't make me so exhausted I can't work out again the next day.  Once you get the routine down, you can pretty much go into autopilot.  If you're looking for something to keep you toned and keep you moving during your pregnancy, this is a good DVD.  I usually only do the salsa dancing and yoga sections which are 20 mins each.  So far, I'm  into my second trimester and haven't gained much and I feel a lot better physically now that I get moving each day.  If you're short on time you can just do one of the 2 workouts and still work up a little sweat.  Hope this helps.",1298592000,2,925,4.169491525423729
1848238,2,B00008J2I7,"Not a big fan because the video is clearly showing a sign of wear even thought it was ""brand new.""  I'm just glad I got it cheep.  The only reason I bought this video was for a quick workout on my 6th workout day.  I wanted something easy to go along with the yoga I already have for my off day and a good recovery from my really challenging workouts.  I have Lindsay Brin and Erin O'Brien which are way better and newer but this was a purchase to just shake things up:)",1296172800,,470,4.021505376344086
1848239,5,B00008J2I7,"I workout frequently and enjoy Tae Bo, the Slim in 6 and Core Secrets series, but being pregnant made me concerned about what appropriate exercise is. Modifying existing workouts works for awhile but as your belly grows it is important not to stain yourself and you need to focus less on weight loss and more on what is best for baby. Fit Mama Prental dvd is a lot of fun. The 20 min Salsa Dance workout is not only fun but it gets you heart rate up and can make you sweat if you really get into it. The Yoga Fat Burn is great and the modified mat work for pregnancy is incredibly helpful since traditional flat-backed mat work is out of the question past 15-20 weeks pregnant. I think the Salsa segment would be a blast even if I weren't pregnant. I highly recommend this.....all you need to do is add in some weights and some walking and you've got a great prengnacy routine to take you from week 1 to week 40.

The DVD has a full set of workout that includes four sections - sausa dance, yoga fat burn, labor & delivery preparation and prenatal stretch and relax. I always do the four parts in a row at a time following the DVD, and it takes roughly one hour each time. I'm not sure how effective it will work for my weight control (Leisa Hart claims that this is not for your weight loss) and the final labor & delivery phase, but it does make me much more energetic than before and I feel less back pains and calf cramps. It is worth a try!",1291680000,,622,4.10655737704918
1848241,5,B00008J2I7,"This is by far my favorite prenatal workout video. I was mostly unable to get off the couch during my first trimester, so I was not looking for anything very intensive. The main thing I wanted in a workout was to know for sure that every part of it is safe for the baby, and Leisa Hart put my mind at ease right off the bat, assuring me that the whole workout meets the  guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and going over warning signs to watch for. I really thought it was just the right amount of challenge for me, although every woman and pregnancy is a different. Some other exercises that I've tried since getting pregnant have drained me of my energy for the rest of the day, but this was just enough to get me lightly perspiring and actually energized me more. I finished the workout and then cleaned the house! As for some people saying that the video was kind of cheesy, I know it's a matter of opinion, but I think she's absolutely adorable, haha. She kept my attention very well (I tend to get bored with workout videos easily), and I especially thought the salsa portion was a lot of fun. Overall, if you're a seasoned yoga veteran, this might not satisfy you, as it is very tailored to the pregnant woman. But if you're like me and actually WANT that, then this is right up your alley. :-)",1291075200,,1337,4.391129032258065

1848243,5,B00008J2I7,"The video is great! Especially for the price! I got a great workout, and it is nice that it changes it up a little with some salsa, then yoga, then mat work. You don't really get bored.",1289520000,,185,4.027027027027027
1848244,4,B00008J2I7,"I bought 3 prenatal WORKOUT-workout (i.e. not yoga/pilates/belly dancing) DVDs.  I enjoy this one but it's the least challenging of the 3 I purchased.  Which I guess you need on some days!  So I do enjoy keeping this in the rotation.  Note, I'm an advanced exerciser (cardio/strength 3-5x a week for years).  I've gotten my best, most challenging workouts during this pregnancy from gym sessions as well as Teddi Bryant's DVD (& to a lesser extent, Erin O'Brien's).  The first time I did this workout was during my 2nd trimester - the salsa was a mild workout (though fun) & I really enjoyed the ""yoga fat burn"" - it provided surprisingly good strength in an unexpected way (similar yet different to traditional yoga).  The belly breathing/strength & stretch are nice too.  Leisa shares a lot of info for us preggos, which is great.  But a part of me realized that this DVD provided a more easy going workout than I'd normally go for.  Fast-forward to the present - I'm now almost 33 weeks & I definitely feel a little more of a workout in the salsa!  Yay, finally!  And I still enjoy the other segments.  So I'm enjoying this workout more these days.  No matter what trimester, overall I appreciate the variety that this DVD provides.  Plus it's great that the different segments mean you can do a combination of different parts of this if you're pressed for time.  If you are a beginner/intermediate, you will probably get the most from this DVD.  But advanced exercisers, note that this is a mellow SUPPLEMENT to your regular workouts/more advanced DVDs, & that you will like it for light days, for variety, & for when you hit the 3rd trimester!",1288224000,,1648,4.666666666666667

1848247,5,B00008J2I7,"I wanted a prenatal workout DVD that provided cardio workouts that I could fit into my busy day. Leisa Hart's Fit Mama: Prenatal Workout definitely delivers!  What I love about this DVD:
1. Short (20 minute) workouts. You can do salsa and yoga back-to-back or choose one. Both are excellent and easy to follow.
2. Additional brief workouts: one to prepare your for labor and delivery, the other a series of nice relaxing stretches to ease common pregnancy aches (including a stretch for the sciatic nerve)
3. Inclusion of women from all trimesters who illustrate trimester-specific adaptations of exercises
4. No real need for additional equipment other than what you already have at home (pillow and towel/yoga strap)
5. Excellent instructor: cues are spot on so you are never left behind and Leisa focuses on proper breathing throughout the entire workout. Best of all, she is not annoying like other pregnancy DVD's (i.e., Summer Sanders).

Great cardio DVD for the expectant mother!",1284940800,,986,5.080246913580247

I might have been wrong in terms of a good, challenging work-out.  The other video I had was hard to complete as my pregnancy progressed but this one is just a challenge because you cannot be lazy!! It's really a great quality work-out. You can do it from beginning to end and it will make you sweat. If you aren't sweating, you aren't utilizing her instructions.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this DVD but if you want something gentle, look somewhere else.  The instructor can be corny at times but they all are!! She is very upbeat and keeps you motivated to finish.  I have such a great energy level after completing this DVD. I'd purchase it again for a friend!",1279065600,,790,4.458333333333333

The yoga fat burn section is a little better, but there is no instruction regarding form and way too much bouncing to be considered proper yoga. The best part was the labor and delivery prep. I did enjoy that part.",1273104000,,380,4.121621621621622
1848250,3,B00008J2I7,"This workout is OK. I like the aerobic aspect as you don't seem to get too much of that by way of prenatal workouts. It is highly repetitive though. I was a little disappointed in the yoga section- it's not at all what I'd expect from Yoga and again- extremely repetitive. I do like the salsa portion and often use it as a warm up to pair with other shorter workouts like the Erin O'Brien workout. One of my pet peeves with this workout- the way Lisa Hart says ""salza"" over and over, but that has no baring on the workout :) Overall, if you're looking for something different to add to your routine this one is OK.",1269820800,,614,4.211864406779661

In addition to being a nice, overall workout for your whole body, Leisa is by far the least annoying workout personality I've ever witnessed.  Her perkiness is minimal and her enthusiasm seems genuine.  I've been doing this workout about 3 times a week (alternating the yoga with the salsa and finishing each workout with the floor work) and overall have been feeling pretty good.  It takes about 40 minutes to do either the salsa and the floor workout or the yoga and the floor workout.  Haven't had enough energy to do the entire DVD which would be about an hour long workout.  Prior to getting pregnant I was in fairly good shape, working out 3 times a week doing step aerobics or swimming, so I did feel like I was in decent shape when I started this DVD.  However, I think its intensity level can be adjusted for anyone at any stage of fitness - even those who didn't work out prior to getting pregnant (once you've cleared it with your doctor, of course).  I hope to be able to use this DVD until the end of my pregnancy!",1267315200,,1197,4.3408071748878925

She has a section for Yoga and Salsa dancing. She explains really well. She gives cues when the movement is going to change. Ms. Hart encourages listening to your body throughout each section, so they workout doesn't become too much. I'd recommend buying this DVD for your at-home-workout.

I purchased it at the beginning of my second trimester and every time I do the salsa portion I get sharp pains in my belly. I am now 31 weeks and still get those pains. The yoga portion is pretty good, but I would not purchase the DVD just for that alone. I was fairly active before getting pregnant and still do cardio and yoga at the gym 3-4 times per week.

The workout itself and the music were so 15 years ago! How could they possibly make salsa lame? I think for women that were into regular excercise and fit before pregnancy there definitely has to be a better workout dvd for us. I honestly burn more calories speed walking and have a way better music selection on my ipod. I really don't recommend this dvd and if anyone would like to buy it used from me for cheap I'd be happy to oblige.

This video does both.  It has great variety on it and it's easy to pick and choose from the menu what you want to do for the day.  I was suprised that even the yoga workout gets my heartrate up and really works out my leg muscles. The yoga is a bit hard to follow the first time because the poses move quickly, but with repetition you get in the grove.  Great video!!",1256688000,,540,4.153846153846154

From the fun cardio salsa dance to a more aerobic style of yoga to calming stretches.  There are also adjustments for each stage of pregnancy, and I found Leisa Hart to be very calming and helpful.

I have done all three and by far my favorite is Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout. It offers about 20 minutes of cardio, 15 mins of weight training, 5 min cooldown, and a relaxation/lamaze section. Of the three dvds it's the only one that really raised my heart rate and got me sweating a little bit, so I actually felt like I got a decent workout.

Leisa Hart's Fit Mama is a fun workout because I enjoy dancing, but it really didn't challenge me. It is good to have on hand for days when your energy level may be low or you just want to dance and have fun!",1251763200,,690,4.3

Unfortunately for me, I found the style to be terribly grating, and not at all comfortable.

I do the salsa dance workout on days when I am not as energized and need a fun workout to motivate me, and I do the yoga fat-burn when I have energy and want a little more of a challenge. I also love the labor and delivery prep and the stetching sections of the workout. They are to-the-point so I can get on with my day and still feel stretched and relaxed.

I would be remiss not to note that Leisa Hart is  disgustingly thin for 9 months pregnant, but forgive her for that.  There is one token ""average/chubby"" pregnant mom working out with her on the video, so take heart!  If you aren't bothered by a yin yang symbol on t-shirts and a few ""eastern"" movements, that's about as ""new age"" as this video gets, (which was important to me).

The instructor seems very knowledgable and is very positive and encouraging.  It's fun to do the Salsa and I look forward to it.  The yoga is very repetitive, but it's sort of nice because this way you do not have to think a lot about what you are doing.  It does work out the hips and legs very well.  It also includes labor preparation exercies and stretches.  It is divided into 4 different sections with the exercises, so you can easily pick and choose which ones you want to do.  It also includes an instructional section.  I was not aware of this when I bought it, but it includes 2 dvds.  The second one is for after you have the baby.

I picked it up again now that I am pregnant with my second, and after two times using it, I think I want to throw it out the window. It's just really boring. She introduces four different sequences and repeats them over and over again with no variation. Once you've done it, you've done it. I want more different exercises to do. I also feel like there isn't enough stretching, which I really need.

My biggest complaint is that there isn't enough instruction. She doesn't say where you should feel a particular exercise or stretch. She isn't specific enough about how to position your arms and legs, feet and hips. And she goes too fast when introducing a new sequence, and I felt like I couldn't figure out how to do it correctly.

For beginners it's not too strenuous, and she keeps reminding you to listen to your body, drink water if you need, take a break if you need it.  The main plus is that you can choose between the salsa dancing or the yoga, or if you are at a higher fitness level, you can do both.

I worked out at the gym three times a week before I started this and it's lower impact and less taxing than what I normally do but I still feel I've worked my body.  It isn't a very intense workout, and the ""yoga"" section is not true yoga but a sort of aerobics/toning workout with yoga elements.  However, I like that!

Also, the salsa dancing is a bit cheesy but you can work up a sweat.  The instructor keeps saying things like ""don't you feel sexy/sassy?"" - my response was always ""no!""  I banned my husband from the room when I was doing this tape because you feel weird.

I enjoyed the yoga fat burn because it forced me to do squats (something I really needed to do).

The fact that the instructor is in her last trimester but looks that good can be a little annoying.  However, I recently saw a photo of her not pregnant and, believe it or not, she did gain some weight in her pregnancy.  I just wish my arms looked like hers!  :o)

I had to stop about 75% of the way through because I was bored to tears and tired of doing the same sequence of moves over . . . and over . . . and over again.  The stretching section is sufficient, although could be a little longer.  The labor and delivery exercises (Kegel exercises and abdominal work) were great.

I use this video for the salsa dance and stretching and skip the yoga.  I use a separate video for yoga on alternate days.",1200355200,,793,4.340136054421769

1848295,4,B00008J2I7,"I like this video, I just think it moves a little bit fast for someone who does not exercise that often or this intensely. I am a very uncoordinated person, and I have a visual problem, so I felt like an idiot moving around in all the wrong ways for the first couple of tries. After a whle I did get the hang of it. I do know that the yoga routine moves a bit too fast for what yoga should be. You can burn fat with yoga without it being this intense. Also this video goes without proper discussion on breathing technique. If you like the yoga segment, I highly reccomend rocki's prenatal yoga series. there are three dvd's, the last two focus on labor and delivery which can really help someone who is too busy or impatient for those classes.

If, however, you would like not having to think too hard about what the next move might be, this dvd will provide you with a fun workout of moderate intensity (If you worked out a lot before getting pregnant, it might be too easy. If you didn't work out at all, it might be a little hard at first). On the days when I've felt sick and exhausted, I knew I could at least do the prenatal yoga portion. I really enjoy both the stretch and relax portion as well as the bonus stretch located in the bonus features section. Lisa is not as annoying as many others, and you can choose to do the workout with our her narration (also under the bonus features).

I have liked using this DVD. It is good if you are looking to exercise for 20 - 35 minutes at a time, but there is also an option to do the full 65 minutes. There is an introduction with cautions, and then two 20-minute workouts. One is the 'salsa dance' which is some basic dance footwork, and the other is the 'yoga fat burn', which is some modified yoga poses. I do like doing both workouts, because they are quick, I feel stretched, and I lightly perspire, but don't feel exhausted. They are slightly repetitious, however, though in 20 minutes, and in your third trimester, you really don't want to have to get complex. There is also a 6 minute 'labor and delivery prep', that focuses on Kegels and abdominals, and an 8 minute stretching portion, that stretches out your body and is really quite good. Sometimes I just do the 20 minute workout, or sometimes add one or both of the stretching/labor prep sessions. Any time I do it, I feel stretched, exercised, and most importantly, not exhausted. I would recommended this DVD.",1192838400,,1203,4.548387096774194

Also I think the microphone is too close to her because she breathes very hard and it sound annoying. The stretching section was very brief, and it was at the end of the DVD.

I find this DVD a bit vigorous for me even though I've been working out for a few years before I got pregnant.  But when u're pregnant, your body kinda slows down a bit and feel less energized.  The moves are also a bit fast to follow but overall, I think the workout was pretty good.

The salsa section was kinda fun and easy to follow.  However, I thought the stretching section a bit too brief as I truly think I can benefit more from more stretching.",1189209600,,526,4.22

And the yoga fat burn section is great too. It is NOT yoga - I do a lot of yoga as well and would not recommend this video if yoga is all you're looking for. But if you're looking to supplement the stretching with an actual workout that tones, burns fat and strengthens, this is the one for you.

And it's still low-impact enough that I come away feeling energized and refreshed, not tired and sore. I'm in my sixth month now, so I'm really starting to feel uncomfortable, but I can still do all the steps without straining in the least.

I am sticking to my non pregnancy workouts and just skipping the floor parts, they actually work my muscles.

It is good workout for those that have been restricted and unable to get a decent workout. The salsa dance was fun and the yoga was harder then I expected. (never having done yoga before) I would have liked it to be little harder, perhaps more cardio but I am not sure how hard you can go during pregnancy. The kegels and prep for labor are very helpful and I plan on using them during my labor. As far as other comments on Leisa's breathing being irritating, yes it is, but I look at tuning her out as practice on focusing off my labor pain. I recommend this video to everyone.  To those that are particularly active, buy it with the open mind that you aren't going to get the workout you would normally do prepregnancy.",1177545600,2,1031,4.196969696969697

This video is encouraging and not overwhelming.  It also helps that Leisa Hart does not wear a fake smile during the workouts, she genuinely seems happy ~ she is also Very pregnant in the video which makes adding on pounds okay :).  The yoga sections are relaxing and approachable even for beginners.  I can't say enough about this DVD!",1176076800,2,645,4.705357142857143

I didn't care for the yoga portion.  The last 2 sessions were way too easy.  I recommend highly purchasing the dvd just for the salsa dance because it is fun and a good way to keep cardiovascularly fit during pregnancy without compromising safety and no modifications are necessary during the trimesters and no special equipment is required.,1175472000,2,497,4.67816091954023
1848325,5,B00008J2I7,"I am currently 7 months pregnant with my 2nd baby and was in decent prepregnancy shape. I didn't get this video until the beginning of my 2nd trimester (and I hadn't worked out much AT ALL during the 1st trimester), so this was a perfect starting point for my prenatal exercise.

I love how Leisa tells you to ""listen to your body"" and to make sure that you can still hold a conversation as you workout. She also tells you to do whatever you feel comfortable doing THAT DAY, as your energy levels will vary from day-to-day throughout your pregnancy.

The salsa segment is fun, upbeat, and since my hips are starting to feel tight, all the salsa hip swaying really helps me feel more ""loosened up."" :)

I've never really done yoga before, but I've gotten the impression that yoga is usually a little more slow-paced than the ""Yoga Fat Burn"" segment on this video, but I really like it. It challenges me and makes me feel like I'm really toning different areas of my body.

The labor & delivery segment is GREAT and reminds me how important it is to do Kegels and to prep your abs for the pushing phase of delivery. I really like how she tells you to focus on keeping the pelvic floor relaxed, as you contract your abdominals. PERFECT practice for proper pushing.

I do both the regular and bonus stretching segments just because they are so relaxing! It's been especially helpful, recently, since my sciatic nerve is pinched and Leisa demonstrates 2 different stretches to help relieve that.

I definitely recommend this DVD and I just bought Leisa's FitMama Postnatal Routine so I can hopefully bounce right back after this baby! Good luck to all you moms! :)",1175212800,5,1659,4.587837837837838

The other four days I do the entire video or, if I'm pressed for time, I combine the salsa segment with some light yoga.

I would say the cardio is about as difficult as a brisk stroll, definitely on the minimal side, but perfect when you are just trying to maintain or are just getting started.

When I'm pregnant, I save the bikini body spring workout for the next year and just focus on being healthy and active now for my baby.

Maybe when I am deep in my 3rd trimester, this salsa dancing might be all I can handle.  In the meantime, I will continue using Kathy Smith's Great Buns and Thighs Step workout for cardio (at beginner-level/low impact intensity), which I highly recommend.

However, instead of doing the floor exercises in that video, I come to this one for Leisa's excellent labor and delivery prep routine.  The DVD includes bonus exercises and stretches which I think are absolutely fantastic and so much more practical and in-depth than other pregnancy videos I've seen.  I do these religiously and I am hoping they will really pay off on the big day.  DVD is worth it for this segment alone.  The Yoga section is also good, but I prefer Shiva Rea's video, which I alternate with this one (and Kathy Smith's step routine).

Overall, I really enjoy Leisa's appealing, encouraging personality and the way she informs you of how an exercise or stretch benefits you, your pregnancy, and/or the baby.  Really makes you feel good as you work out.",1156550400,2,1177,4.787128712871287

The Yoga fat burn feels fantastic and I think this will really help as my pregnancy progresses. I plan on using this on those days when I need a little slower paced workout, and believe it will be especially nice in my third trimester when I really should be slowing down.

1848356,4,B00008J2I7,"I felt that there needed to be one more review on this DVD, as I feel that I was almost falsly mislead by negative feedback in some of the other reviews.

I felt great after doing this workout! Lisa is encouraging at a time when I need encouragement. The workout is indeed a good and worthwhile workout for ANDYBODY except the queen of the gym who does kick-butt cardio and/or pilates and/or spin classes every day. But use your head, what would you expect from a pregnancy workout? Of course it doesn't compare to the hard-core workouts at the gym. It shouldn't. The people who think that you get no workout at all from this DVD are either the person I described above, (and in my opinion, that person should just continue what they've been doing and modify according to their heart rate) OR they are the people who do the motions but do not concentrate on correctly doing the exercise. If you're in better shape, you may have to focus a bit more on each exercise in order to make the workout reach an appropriate intesity, and if you're more of a beginner, then just doing the moves may be enough to get your heart rate up.

As for the repetitiveness of the workout, it is a bit on the repetitive side. You might want a couple of DVD's to switch out with so you don't get bored doing the same thing every day. BUT, if you're like me, and find that you get a little confused with complicated moves and end up marching in place like an idiot trying to figure out what the rest of the group is doing . . . this just may be the right DVD for you. I can follow it. I enjoy it. I like the repetition for the ease of following along, and I do not find Lisa to be condescending at all. I find her to be encouraging and thinking of ALL fitness levels, as a good instructor should.

I would give it 5 stars if this was the only DVD I possibly could need for my entire pregnancy, but it is not so spectacular that I don't want to switch up my daily workout with other faces and routines from time to time. Still a pretty good workout that I thoroughly enjoy every time I do it.",1151798400,10,2068,4.190954773869347

I LOVE the bonus stretching segment, I do these stretches as often as possible.  The yoga and cardio segments are a little repetative, but that can be nice for the forgetfull pregnant woman.  This is not a difficult workout, so I felt totally comfortable doing it while pregnant and never worried about doing too much.

I thoroughly enjoyed the labor tips and had a wonderful delivery and i really feel alot of it had to do with my ob telling me to use this dvd and stick with it, and i did, and i am thankful to Leisa Hart for having such a great attitude and teaching such a fun and useful prenatal workout.

But the novelty of the dance steps was amusing and it went by quickly.  Again,  I never broke a sweat and didn't really ""count it"" as exercise, but I thought it helped me sleep a little better when  I was having trouble with sleep during the 3rd trimester.  I liked the yoga portion the best, and it felt really good to go through the poses,  esp.  when the baby was in  awkward positions in  utero.  It was nice to stretch in different ways and help dislodge him from  grating against my ribs.  (it wasn't always successful.)

The problem is that the aerobic and yoga sections are really, really repetitive which makes it boring to do. I did this workout once and haven't touched it since. The aerobics involve various ""mamba"" moves which are fun to do at first, but the same moves are repeated over and over throughout the 20 minute segment. The yoga section just repeats the same sequence about 6 times on each side. With so many yoga postures that can be combined in so many ways, it is a shame they chose to bore the viewer by doing the same ones throughout the entire segment.

You want to do SAFE AND EFFECTIVE prego movements, not cram your brain with overblown choreography. The Salsa Dance was a great tempo, I wasn't over-exerting myself, i felt sexy and alive!

It is really nice that you can do more or less depending on how you feel that day.  But what I really think makes this DVD special and why I have recommended it to family and friends are the things above and beyond the workout.

After the workout portion there are 2 sections, (1) Labor and Delivery Prep & (2) Prenatal stretch and relax.  I LOVE these sections and wish I had done them with my first pregnancy.  I love how she is targeting areas to stretch and things that are very specific to a pregnant woman and the changes going on in your body.  I think last time I wasn't pushing the right way during delivery and I tore really bad!  After doing this DVD I can see how I could have pushed more from my abs without contracting my pelvic floor so much and it would have really helped.

I also love the 2 bonus video segments.  One is about easing labor (i.e. things to do during labor to help make it easier) and the other is additional stretching.  Both are great.  You might not thing you need to do the easing labor one right now, but it is good to start practicing those things early so they are second nature when labor gets crazy.

I do the labor and delivery prep, prenatal stretch and relax, and both bonus segments every time I exercise and sometimes again at night.  I really think this is what is making the difference in how I feel.

Bottom line:  The workout it okay, and I think it is nice to know that I'm doing enough, but not too much, but I LOVE the extra features and that is what really makes this DVD worth the money.",1143072000,8,1693,4.24375

1848373,3,B00008J2I7,"I like Leisa Hart's routine in general, especially the Salsa part. However there are few of things that disappointed me a lot:

First of all, this excercise doesn't concentrate on particular body parts, even the yoga part, which promises to burn fat in your upper leg area. I think that I had to move too many body parts at the same time to strengthen one particular part I was interested in.

Second major shortcoming is that every block, e.g. salsa, yoga, was too repetitive and by the end I felt getting almost robotic doing the same things over and over.

The third major thing is that there was no stretching until the end and this stretching didn't compensate the entire workout.

I also found it hard to do yoga part right after Salsa, even though it was recommended to do two of them in a row, because I overheated during first part and usually preferred to skip to stretching part right away. I passed the speech test during excercise, which means that my intensity level was normal, however, every time I started sweating excessively and that's not good for your baby. This problem reduced the overall excercise time from 1 hour, as I initially expected, to just 30 minutes.

I switched to a different excercise routine, when I was 6 month pregant, and my muscles finally started feeling in place and in shape again, which I didn't get from Lisa's excercises. Lisa Heitz's Prenatal workout DVD is good for bursting your energy or ""feeling sexy"" while doing salsa, but I wouldn't recommend it for a real workout.",1142467200,,1521,4.681647940074907

I think it would be a better video for someone who is not used to exercising a lot, and who just wants to do *something* while pregnant.

I also found Leisa Hart to be very annoying, and my friends and I had to do this video on mute so we didn't have to hear the sound of her breathing.  She breathes so loud!!!  I know she is trying to remind the viewer to breathe by example, but it drove me crazy.

I did the video 2-3 times and now it collects dust.",1142467200,2,689,4.097014925373134

The salsa portion is better than the yoga segment--particularly if you're experienced at all with yoga.  I find that if I do the salsa segment twice and skip the yoga, I get my heart rate up a little and manage to avert any nausea that might result from bending over.  I also usually add small hand weights to the workout to enhance the effects.

Needless to say I had to take my fitness routine down a notch and FitMama was a great video for me.  I keep reading a lot of reviews on here from people who claim to be fitness gurus like I was.  One woman even says how she worked out 4-8 hours a day prior to pregnancy (a little extreme...).  I suppose if you work out 4-8 hours a day, this would be boring.  But for someone like me who generally did things like jogging 3-5 miles or taking a cycling or step class plus weight training prior to pregnancy, this DVD is perfect.  I cannot stress how important it is for people to realize that you are PREGNANT and your body is not meant to handle vigorous exercise during this time.  It's important to exercise daily while pregnant, but also important to keep your heart rate around 140 bpm or below and get a great stretching routine in.  Aside from some rather repetitious moves, this is a great video because it gets your heart rate up to where it should be but you won't overdo it which is dangerous.

1848390,5,B00008J2I7,"Of the many prenatal workouts I own, this is one of my favorites for the following reasons:

1.) The Salsa workout. Cheesy as it may sound, it is actually a fun way to do a low-impact aerobic prenatal workout. It's only 20 minutes and I believe that anyone of any fitness level could benefit from it. If you are just starting, you could take it slow and 'lose the arms'. If you're a regular excerciser, you can do it as is or add a little more 'sass' to the moves.

You do feel a little bit silly when she tells you 'you look sexy' or that 'you're getting sassy' but hey--it's not like positive thinking hurts, right? Nonetheless, my husband is forbidden from coming into the room while I'm doing a salsa workout with Lisa Hart and her pregnant friends.

 2.) The Yoga Fat Burn. I really like this moderate workout- I feel stretched and relaxed and see results from these very simple yoga-inspired moves. Another great thing is that there are simple variations by trimester.

3.) Birth prep.

4.) Overall, Lisa is good at striking a balance between showing/explaining her moves without going so slowly that you get annoyed each subsequent time that you do the workout. A very important feature when you're watching a video over and over!",1139443200,3,1237,4.6
1848391,3,B00008J2I7,"I am in my 5th month of pregnancy and worked out pre-pregnancy and up to this point in my pregnancy.  I didn't find this workout to be at all challenging.  A person just starting to workout would be very satisfied and appropriately challenged with this workout.  The segments seemed very repetitive.  The yoga section was very jerky, no movements were held for any length of time.  The instructor wasn't annoying nor was the music, I just didn't find this workout to be very good for someone who is used to working out.",1139443200,,519,4.5978260869565215
1848392,3,B00008J2I7,"This is a nice alternative to have when you need to mix things up with your workouts....but- both the salsa dance and yoga fat burn are pretty basic. The yoga portion was a bit disappointing to me, maybe because it was more of a cardio version (breathing and moves are not all typical yoga.. some moves too fast, etc.). Leisa is easy to follow and isn't annoying so it's worth it from that perspective. I gave it 3 starts because I liked it, but I could probably live without it.",1139270400,,479,4.333333333333333
1848393,4,B00008J2I7,"This morning, I did Leisa Hart's FitMama Prenatal Workout. It is really great!!!

It starts with a short introduction about the workout, and why you should workout, and warning signs that you have to pay attention to.

Leisa is in her third trimester, and she has two women in their second trimester and two women in their first trimester working out with her. She has a good manner, not too annoying, and she has a nice voice with a Southern accent, but not too strong. The set is nice, not too much to comment on. A couple disembodied windows, but that seems to be something that a lot of workout videos love.

There are four sections to the actual workout - a 20 minute or so Salsa Routine, a 20 minute or so Yoga Fat Burning Routine, a 10 minute or so Floor Routine, and a 10 minute or so Stretch. You can choose to do either the salsa or the yoga, or both. This morning, I did both.

The Salsa routine was a lot of fun, and not too hard for someone like me who has very little coordination. She does a few different steps, shows some variation, and repeats and builds onto the routine in a doable manner. She is very encouragine, and talks about how wonderful the bellies are.. I like that.

The Fat Burning Yoga is also good, though I would hesitate to call it yoga. It is too quick, more a yoga-inspired light cardio. And that is fine. She doesn't use most of the actual yoga pose terminology, but does a great job at explaining the safe way to do them, and it felt good.

The Floor Work is mostly kegels. She explains kegels well, and why they are important.

For the final Stretch, there is some nice work. It felt nice, and ended with a short meditation/breathing at the end.

Overall, I really really liked this workout. I liked it a ton more than the corny Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout, and I like that it is somewhat customizeable. If I had less time, I could do just one of the main sections, and if I feel good, I can do both. And that is cool. Highly recommended for all of us pregnant ladies!!",1138752000,,2011,4.287598944591029

1848395,5,B00008J2I7,"This video was such a good workout! I am in my second trimester and used to workout quite a lot before I conceived. Since I have been pregnant, I haven't had any energy and have been nauseous almost constantly. Not only is the video fun, but it gave me more energy afterwards, she also has great tips to relieve pain during pregnancy and great stretches!

This is even a video I can do when I am really nauseous as there isn't a lot of jumping or jiggling around. I actually feel less nauseous after working out! I was worried after finishing that I did not get enough of a workout because I wasn't sweating, but I've had sore muscles the next day. I like to break up the 20 min. salsa and the 20 min. yoga and do one in the morning and one at night.

Usually the too-happy, bubbly instructors irritate me, but I wasn't bugged by her at all; I really felt like she was truly enjoying herself. The salsa dance was fun, although repetetive, but just what I need for my last 11 weeks. I only gave it four stars because during the Kegels segment, she never explains what you're supposed to be doing. I know how to do Kegels, so I was fine, but it is possible that someone would not know. Overall, I think this is a great video.",1138579200,,578,4.263636363636364
1848397,2,B00008J2I7,"I was hoping for something with a little more substance.  The Salsa section is entirely on your feet, so if you are experiencing any foot related issues like I am (my arches have fallen during this pregnancy), then this section lacks luster.

The instructor just seems to be all over the place in general.  At no time did I feel that any particular muscle group was getting attention.  There were not enough repetitions at any one time to acheive a feeling of fitness.

  I purchased 2 other pregnancy workouts that I feel are far better than this one (if any of you are interested.)  Check out ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" and ""Fusion Pilates for pregnancy"".  The first gives you real challenges that are safe and the second is great for flexibility and aching lower backs.",1138406400,,777,4.696296296296296

I LOVE THE YOGA workout, its non-tradional yoga moves that Leisa fuses with some pilates type toning moves.

1848405,5,B00008J2I7,"after having tried over 6 different prenatal videos, FITMAMA no doubt is the best video to stay in shap, not to get in shape, like so many people seem to say in their reviews. I did not get pregnant and expect to get into better shape, i only hoped to maintain a decent level of exercise. I am an avid jogger and do yoga three times a week at the studio, but did not want to keep doing non-pregnancy workouts and went back to my home video workouts. Leisa does some mild salsa moves that are repetitive more non cumbersome, very little to no impact. The yoga fat burn was a great tone to a body that didn't need weights, just mild workouts. I find it interesting that some women think that a video is only good if you get a total body sweat or feel the burn for days, that is silly. I exercise during pregnancy for my health and my babies health, and if i want a meditative yoga workout i rry something else. This is the PERFECT PRENATAL VIDEO, i recommend to anyone and say you should try several to see what is best for you, but after doing 6, this one is the best for me.",1134604800,5,1074,4.119047619047619
1848406,2,B00008J2I7,"I purchased and tried 3 prenatal fitness DVDs around the same time:

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout

* Prenatal Yoga

* Leisa Hart's Fit Mama Prenatal Workout

Here's how I thought they compared.  (Note that I do yoga and walk regularly; while I enjoy dancing, I do not dance regularly.  I'm not overweight.)

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout - 5 stars.  Designed and narrated by a Cirque du Soleil acrobat (faint French accent), this video is my favorite of the three.  The woman demonstrating the workout is about 8 months pregnant and in amazing athletic shape (visible muscle definition).  The theme of this video seems to be preparing for birth and staying strong and fit.  It has two sections: (a) workout and (b) instructions.

  (a) After a mercifully brief cheesy earth-mother introduction, the yoga-based workout is vigorous yet flowing and straightforward, building incredible muscle strength, flexibility, and stamina.  It includes squats, lunges, lots of ab work, lots of great hip stretches, kegels, lots of different arm strengtheners.  At the end I am sweating, breathing harder, relaxed, and satisfied.  The next day my muscles are sore (in a good way) and feel stronger.  The music is world-beat without vocals, easy to exercise to.

  (b) The instructions section is excellent as well.  Animated anatomical graphics clearly illustrate diastasis, how to check yourself for it, and how to modify your workout to avoid further muscle separation, as well as exactly what kegels are.  This part also explains in depth how to do the moves in the workout.

* Prenatal Yoga - 4 stars.  Designed and narrated by a UCLA-graduated yogi, this video is my second favorite.  Shiva is under 3 months' pregnant in the demonstration but has women behind her in second and third trimesters.  The theme of this video seems to be relaxing and preparing for motherhood.  It has three sections: (a) workout, (b) massage, and (c) interview.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy, but includes squats, lunges, many spinal twists, kegels (no deep explanation, just metaphor), lots of different stretches.  At the end I am sweating a bit, relaxed, and satisfied.  The music is new-age without vocals.  For some reason, Shiva does not pronounce the ""h"" in ""exhale"" which can be distracting.  Also the narration gets slightly out of sync with the demonstration in a few places, which can be confusing.

  (b) The massage section is fabulous if you have a partner willing to watch it and give you one!  Great techniques for feet, legs, back, and neck.

  (c) Shiva explains her story in the interview, how her father named her after an Indian god, how she took up yoga in college, etc.

* Leisa Hart's FitMama - 2 stars.  I bought this on Amazon's recommendation and I'm sorry I did.  My biggest gripe is that this video doesn't focus on smooth continuous deep breathing, unlike the other two DVDs.  Leisa is a perky actress who does infomercials.  She is 8 months pregnant in this but her body looks very different (thin, wiry) compared to the woman's in Perfect Pregnancy (athletic).  The theme of this video seems to be feeling better (sexier) about oneself while pregnant.  It has basically two sections: (a) workout and (b) bonus stretches.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy yet goes at a faster, more erratic pace than either of the other two videos.  It has four parts: salsa dance, ""yoga fat burn,"" labor and delivery prep, and prenatal stretch and relaxation.  The dancing is about 8 moves repeated, with a few squats.  I feel foolish and bored doing this.  The yoga fat burn is more aerobics than yoga, includes ab work, squats, no twists, never holds any pose for long, is repetitive.  Labor and delivery prep includes kegels (no real explanation), many boring arm swings, ab work.  Prenatal stretch and relaxation includes leg stretches, ab work, is repetitive.  The music is salsa, soft rock, and world beat without vocals; very good workout music, loud in places.

  (b) The bonus stretches are the best part, but are buried under Special Features (the DVD doesn't seem very well organized).  These include leg, back, hip and shoulder stretches actually held for several seconds, squats, plenty of rapid boring arm swings.

All three videos show women in different trimesters doing the exercises and mention appropriate modifications.  All three videos explain how to do the exercises safely and how to recognize warning signs of overdoing it.

If you're a yoga gal like me and you want to buy just one prenatal yoga video, get Perfect Pregnancy.  If you want your partner to give you a great massage too, get Prenatal Yoga.",1134604800,122,4676,4.940721649484536
1848407,4,B00008J2I7,"I like the choices I have with this DVD. I can marry it well with the other exercising I am doing. If I need something more aerobic, I do the salsa dance, labor prep, and relaxation. If I need more stretching, I do the yoga fat burn, labor prep, and relaxation. Do take her advise and never skip the labor prep and relaxation. I feel great afterwards. Also, I am at the end of my first trimester and I never felt nauseous throughout this routine like I did with Yoga Journal. I attribute this to the pacing and the reminders to ""take my time.""",1134000000,2,543,4.230769230769231
1848408,2,B00008J2I7,"I personally didn't like this DVD.  I found it to be repetitive and way too long.  I didn't get a whole lot out of it.  I realize weight loss is not my objective while being pregnant, but I thought I would get a little more stretching and strengthening than I did.  I got totally confused on the breathing.  I would be breathing out when you're supposed to be breathing in, so I ended up a little light-headed at the end.  I never got the routine down and was constantly having to look at the TV to see where she was at, thus getting me out of a position I was supposed to be in.  I'm not saying it's a bad DVD.  It's gotten a lot of good reviews, which is why I bought it.  I was just unhappy with the cardio and so-called yoga.  I didn't like that ""ab"" workout, where you breath out and contract your ab muscles.  It just didn't feel right.  I just didn't feel right after doing this workout.",1133827200,,894,4.104046242774566

1848410,4,B00008J2I7,"This is my first prenatal workout video and I found it to be just the right activity level for me. Before I got pregnant, I was a very active jogger. Now, at 13 weeks, I walk more than run. Fit Mama is a good supplement to that. The 20 min salsa routine is fun and very easy to follow along (no confusing steps and lots of repetition). Most of the cardio comes from constantly lifting your arms above your head; a good way to work up a light sweat. And the 20 min yoga is also very easy; the moves are so simple, I've remembered and used them without having to put the DVD in! The biggest benefit I get from Fit Mama is improved digestion. Like many pregnant women, I've had bouts of indigestion/heartburn, but all the stretching and arm movements of this DVD really helps my stomach feel less bloated.",1133222400,,802,4.282894736842105

It is refreshing to have a modern prenatal video. You do work up a sweat salsa dancing, and it's a change from the grapevine and more traditional moves of older videos. The cardio segment is only 20 minutes long, which is ideal for less-fit moms, but others might want more. There's a ""fat burning"" yoga section which may tone beginners, but if your fit and work out with weights, it will do very little for you.

I prefer Kathy Smith's prenatal video workout, but this one's #2 on my list and I was psyched to see the modern set, outfits and music!",1128038400,6,716,4.424242424242424

They were worthless, irritating, boring or an unpleasant combination of all three.  Leisa Hart's Fit Mama is TOTALLY different.  Leisa doesn't have an abrasive voice and I didn't find her the least bit annoying - and I am really easily annoyed so that's saying a lot!  All of the exercises really give you a workout.  I consider myself in pretty good shape and it takes a good deal for me to feel as if I have derived anything from a workout.  I feel as if I have accomplished something just doing one section of Fit Mama.  I like to alternate between the Salsa Dance, on days I feel more upbeat and energetic, and the Fat Burning Yoga on days when I need more of a tension-releasing exercise that will still keep me fit and strong.

Unlike some very lame pregnancy fitness videos, this one modifies the workout for each trimester instead of segmenting the workout into tiny pointless five minute sections for each trimester like some videos I regretfully spent money on!

I am so happy I found this!  I only wish I had discovered it before my sixth month!!!  I feel confident that this will help me keep my stamina up through the remainder of my pregnancy.  Doing something positive for myself and my body has encouraged me to take care of myself better in all aspects.  It is worth every penny, and maybe more!

The point is to keep your heart rate relatively low while increasing your energy levels, toning muscles and improving flexibility.

  On the positive side, I liked the fact that there are women of varying builds and stages of pregnancy in the video.  There is always someone to identify with!  I also like the fact that some of the exercises are modified according to trimester.  The labor and delivery prep was my personal favorite as it allows you to work on your abs in a safe and effective way.  Another plus is that you can turn off the narration and just workout to music.

  The only real negative for me was the salsa section. Although many other people seem to have enjoyed this section I found it almost unbearably repetitive after just a few workouts.

The Power Yoga and stretching have been particularly helpful for me.  When I do the workout in the evening after work, I find that I sleep better, and don't wake up achy or stiff at all!

The salsa workout is fun.  If you were active pre-pregnancy and are in your 1st or early 2nd trimester, keep in mind that it is not terribly challenging.  Personally, I enjoyed it, but wasn't able to get my heartrate up much.  It's great for those low energy days though.

Overall, I'm very happy with this video and look forward to using it throughout the rest of my pregnancy. I highly recommend it and looking forward to Leisa's post-natal workout! next.",1125705600,2,803,4.4520547945205475

She has an excellent Yoga Fat Burning Session focusing on legs and butt that I love. I always feel soreness, so I know it is working. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because before I got pregnant I was an advid running and I consider myself fit. The cardio sessionis only 20 minutes, for me that is a little short. I like 30-40 minute cardio sessions. So I do the cardio twice in a row. If you are serious about doing something , order this videow!",1125532800,,589,4.0

During my second and now in my third semester I work up a sweat doing this once ""easy"" work out. The video is does repeat a lot of moves, but that way you don't have to think too much and can work on perfecting the moves. The yoga section is a faster fat burn type vs. Hatha that I was use to, but it does wonders for my back that has gotten stiff and sore. The streaching and bonus streach feel great too.

Leisa does a great job of presenting routines that help you workout without being too difficult.  While some may feel these things may be short or not 100% ""accurate"" yoga or salsa, this DVD accomplishes its goals - providing me with a workout that I can do during my pregnancy.  If I am going to workout, I would rather make sure I am safe rather than pushing too hard.  If makes more sense that way to me.

Staying active and exercising with Leisa helped give me the strength and energy I needed for the delivery.  It also helped me feel sexy during pregnancy instead of ""fat"".  I loved that she had exercises to help strengthen stomach muscles even while pregnant!  On days I felt more tired, I only did the yoga section.

The moves are simple enough that even a total klutz like me can do them with no problem after one practice viewing.

I do agree with the other reviewers that say the yoga section is boring.  I do only about 10 minutes of that section - just enough to get a good stretch on both sides of my body and a bit of the abdominal work.  Any longer than that and I get bored doing the same moves over and over again.

The second part, the Yoga Fat Burn breaks a light sweat while providing good stretches, again without over exertion.

The third part which includes stretches and floor exercises allows you to cool down, relax, and also walks you through some breathing exercises along with Kegel exercises.

This workout is fun to do, not time consuming (20 minute segments so you can do what you want, have time for or have energy for.)  It's also very easy to follow without sudden movements that can pull, strain or injure.  Leisa Hart is good at delivering instructions and following through with them at appropriate times.

My dr said the weight loss was ok and to still eat the right amount of calories to maintain my nutrition for myself and the baby.

1848448,2,B00008J2I7,"I have tried several prenatal workout DVD's. I am an intermediate exerciser and in fairly decent shape. So the pregnancy DVD's are mostly unchallenging for me until late in the pregnancy.

I got FitMama in the second trimester and the first time through, was bored out of my mind. Even making the moves pretty big, I didn't get my heartrate up at all. I waited until the third trimester to review it, to be fair. Now with my pregnancy nearly over, I have tried this several times again, and while it is slightly more of a workout, it is still incredibly boring. The salsa portion is the same 3 or 4 moves, over and over again for 20 minutes. The yoga fat burn is even worse. It is 4 or 5 moves that are based on yoga poses, and you do them over and over again, switching sides, for 20 minutes. Nothing wrong with the moves per se, but it is not what I would call ""yoga"" or even ""power yoga"", and just way too repetitive. Now, I have to say that Leisa Hart's Gym in a Box DVD, which is not geared specifically for pregnant women, has been pretty good for me for pregnancy. I didn't like it much before I got pregnant, but for pregnancy it works great as it is low impact and easy to modify. The moves are more varied than FitMama. I'd say the same for Kathy Smith's TimeSave Cardio Fat Burner, for an experienced, very pregnant exerciser who gets tired many days, the 20 minute workouts on here have been great for me.

Once I reached 35-36 weeks of pregnancy, I found it absolutely appropriate, right at my pace and abilities.  I appreciate seeing Leisa struggle into some positions as I do.

At four months of pregnancy, however, here was my impression:
The ""salsa"" aerobic portion is too short, and considering that I spend a lot of time in latin aerobic and dance classes, Leisa's ""salsa"" steps are ridiculous. Having practiced yoga for the past 3 years, I do not understand what in the world Leisa Hart is trying to accomplish with the ""yoga fat burn"" session. The abs conditioning is too short, and there is absolutely NO upper body (chest, arms) or useful back conditioning in this DVD, despite that a strong back is essential during pregnancy. Many DVDs and videos contain, for the same price, postnatal exercise and advice. My perspective is that of someone who exercises several times a week through Aikido, yoga, pilates, aerobics, and weight training. Perhaps the video would be good for someone new to exercise.  The all-around workout in 50 minutes seems less productive than alternating aerobics one day and some form of body conditioning (yoga, pilates, weights) another. I prefer Kathy Smith's pregnancy workout, an oldie but goodie, with more substantive aerobics and upper body, leg, and abdominal workouts, plus good starter post-partum exercises.",1109289600,5,1400,5.100436681222708

The DVD allows you to pick and choose what type of workout you want to do ... from the fat-burning yoga one day to the Salsa dance (my absolute favorite). The Salsa is easy to learn and the music perfect, not some disco club loud stuff. Plus, there are lots of prenatal stretches and relaxation techniques.

My body is well adjusted since i started doing this Fitmama tape and I find it to be absolutely key to my pregnancy, i love it, and i have thoroughly enjoyed leisa harts videos that helped my get into shape last year before i got prego this summer.

The salsa can easily be modified to your level - I find that taking wider steps and keeping my arms strong through the movements, helps me achieve a decent cardio workout.

I have bought many workout DVDs over the past 5 months, and most were SLOW and BORING! I wanted to get a great workout during my toddler's naptime and this DVD gets me up and moving. GREAT workout - I can't say enough! Buy FitMama!",1092009600,4,332,4.123076923076923
1848461,5,B00008J2I7,"This video is great!  The instructor is in her last trimester of pregancy and participates in the whole video, which gave me confidence that the workout is completely safe.  She also has class participants in the first trimester and second trimester in the video.

There are some modifications for each trimester, but they are very easy to follow, just keep your eyes on the class participants that are in the same trimester as you are.

There are two main 20 minute workouts.  One is a traditional Aerobics workout (called Salsa Dance) and the other is a yoga style workout.  This gives you the flexibility to alternate between workouts.  Or early in your pregnancy (or later days when you have a lot of energy) you can do both workouts back to back for 40 minutes of exercise.

After the two main workouts there are two stretching sections (one for toning muscles for delivery and one for traditional cooldown).  Again, sometimes I have been alternating these and sometimes I run through both.  These are 6 minutes and 8 minutes long.

I also appreciated the fact that the equipment you need for this workout is minimal.  They call for a towel or sticky yoga mat, a pillow, yoga ball (which I ended up substituting to another small pillow), and a yoga strap/another towel.  So I was able to get started quickly and fully participate.

I have been participating in aerobics classes for many years on and off and I agree with some of the other viewers that this is not the most strenuous workout out there.  However, I find it very challenging at my 5th month of pregnancy.  And you can do the two main workouts together for more challenge.  So it really suits my needs, and I think it will suit the needs of the majority of pregnant women.

The instructor is also very helpful and encouraging.

I also purchased Fusion Pilates by Jennifer Gianni and did not like that video at all and will be selling it.  I think you must be very experienced in Pilates before you were pregnant to be able to follow and get a lot out of the Fusion Pilates video.",1090627200,12,2047,4.571428571428571
1848462,5,B00008J2I7,"FITMAMA Prenatal is no doubt the BEST EVER prenatal made to hit the market. I LOVED IT. Leisa Hart is a guru with fitness programming, I loved her BUNS OF STEEL videos a few years back and loved it when I saw that she did a prenatal video, expecially after doing  a few others that bored me to tears. This was fund, the Salsa dancing got my heart rate to a great level, the yoga was new and fun, a great variation that Leisa explains well and it toned my hips and legs and got my back ready to deliver another healthy baby, this is a TWO THUMBS UP video!!!",1088467200,4,556,4.054545454545455
1848463,5,B00008J2I7,"I was so excited to find Leisa Hart's prenatal workout DVD. With my last pregnancy, I took up walking and tried doing whatever prenatal workout I could, but my well-meaning husband got me a prenatal yoga video that I just HATED to do. It felt a little too much like work, forcing myself to do it. Now 4 months into my second pregnancy, this DVD has been a lifesaver! Not only do I not mind doing it, but it's actually FUN! Plus, with the DVD format, you can pick and choose what type of workout you want to do ... from the fat-burning yoga one day to the Salsa dance (my absolute favorite) the next. Plus, there are lots of prenatal stretches and relaxation techniques. I especially like how fun and upbeat Leisa Hart keeps this workout ... not at all boring or ""meditative"" like some. Just a great prenatal workout in general! Five stars!",1088121600,6,839,4.419354838709677

1848465,5,B00008J2I7,I really enjoyed this DVD.  After being on bedrest for 10 weeks I was very deconditioned.  I love to exercise but wanted something low level enough I could do without problems in my 3rd trimester.  The yoga part was good as well as the slasa danceing part.  But it is low level.  She is in her 3rd trimester while conducting the video.  The moves were good and easy to perform with my large belly.  Overall a great video for 3rd trimester pregnancy.,1086134400,3,449,4.402439024390244
1848466,5,B00008J2I7,"I found this tape to be fun, which kept me motivated to continue working out as long as I could.  You definitly get an appropriate workout and feel like you've done something when your done.  The dance steps are easy to follow and the encouragement from Leisa makes you smile:)",1085788800,,277,4.52
1848467,3,B00008J2I7,"This video isn't bad. The cardio salsa dancing at the beginning, although it's very repetitive, is a good workout that will make you break a sweat. And it's kind of fun. The floorwork with streches and kegels is fine too. I'm sure I will be doing these portions of the video many times before my pregnancy is over.
And the instructor, Leisa Hart, is a pleasant woman with a pretty smile. I like her clear, forceful style of instruction. Unlike some video instructors, there's nothing annoying about her.
However, the Yoga Fat Burn section of the video is awful. Be warned, those of you who are experienced with yoga, that the workout here IS NOT YOGA! It's low-impact aerobics with only 3 or 4 yoga-themed moves that are repeated over and over. I didn't mind the repetition in the salsa dance, but this section is just terrible. The poses are awkward and incorrect, and the transitions between them clumsy. She actually asks you to bounce in a triangle pose! By the time I was finished this section (and I thought it would never end) I had developed a pain in my left ankle, which is very unusual for me. And I didn't feel like I had really done anything useful in terms of strengthening or toning muscles.
If you want a safe and smooth yoga workout for pregnancy try Yoga Mama or Prenatal Yoga.
All in all, this is a decent video. It's not a total waste of money--IF you skip the ""yoga"" section and just do the rest of it.",1085616000,7,1423,4.4559386973180075
1848468,5,B00008J2I7,"My husband purchased this DVD during my second month of pregnancy, and I have found it an indispensable part of my fitness routine.  Prior to my pregnancy, I was an avid runner (35-40 miles/week) and practiced Bikram yoga 1-2 times per week.  Unfortunately, fatigue and morning sickness reduced my running to walking and the Bikram yoga was out per doctor's orders.  I have absolutely loved this DVD as it has the right level of activity, plenty of variety and is presented in a very easy to do and understand format.  Not to mention the salsa dancing is quite fun!  It is the perfect addition to a prenatal fitness routine to keep you fit and safe during your pregnancy with plenty of tips and information.  Highly recommend it!  Would also suggest purchase of the yoga ball through leisahart.com.  (not available at Amazon.com unfortunately)",1085443200,2,843,4.887323943661972

I saw this video online and it got really good reviews so I decided to try it out.  It is a pretty decent video broken into four sections.  There is a yoga segment (20 minutes), a salsa dance segment (20 minutes), and two stretching segments (8 to 10 minutes each).  The yoga and salsa segments are fun, but they repeat the same moves over and over again.  It's good to know that you're doing the right moves and not have to practice too much and also to feel comfortable since this big belly can make you off balance.  However, I wish that I felt more of workout after doing the salsa or the yoga.  My only complaint is that I am not working up a real sweat.  Otherwise, it is a slow and steady workout to help you maintain fitness throughout pregnancy.",1085011200,,881,4.296969696969697

I like the fact that Leisa does the same move several times, it makes it safe and i feel i am doing mu body good. I can't stand to do so many moves that i get confused or wonder what is next. This video is ideal for a beginner or an advanced level exerciser, which is me, because you cannot be too safe during preganacy. I loved Leisa Hart's style and teaching, she makes me feel food about me and i feel my legs and mid section getting stronger even though i am getting a bit heaveier, this is absolutley the best prenatal workout you will find, i highly recommend it!!!",1084924800,,658,4.188976377952756

For this one, I am preparing to move into a new home and I already have a 2 1/2 yr old so getting to the gym is not as easy as it used to be, but I want to keep in shape with this pregnancy as I did the first.  This video is so REPETITIVE it is unbelievable.  The yoga portion literally is 3 moves that you repeat for 20 minutes!!  After completing the video for the first time, I didn't feel as though I worked out and felt like I still needed to go to the gym.  The Kathy Smith video is a much better purchase for someone who has been working out and who likes variety, rather than 3 repetitive moves.
This video is only for women who are just starting to work out.  It is definitely not for someone who is used to regular aerobic activity and/or weight training.",1084924800,16,913,3.9835164835164836
1848472,4,B00008J2I7,"My husband bought this for me, knowing I needed something to do other than just walking since all my other exercise videos are a bit too intense for pregnancy.  I love the salsa dance section of the video, it loosens the rigidity of your structure when you move your hips. During my pregnancy, my hips have been the biggest complaint.. I find it difficult to move at times and at first I was a bit nervous to try the little extra hip movements, but it really helped loosen that area.  Not painful at all! Plus the Salsa dance is FUN! Then the yoga section, while there are some great moves, she does three repetitions, which are nice and probably what you should do, I get really bored during this.  I love yoga and have so much fun stretching, but I wish she would do more than just two or three moves, three times on each side.  It is my least favorite section of the video, and yoga is my favorite exercise modality.  Then there is the labor and delivery and stretching section.  I really enjoy the comfort and ease, yet intesity of it.  It is very nice.  needless to say, my husband did a great job, I just need another video or two, so I don't go crazy with redundancy.",1084752000,,1174,4.304545454545455

The reason I give it a four star and not a five star is I found the aerobic part to be a bit too easy and I wish it was 30 minutes in length instead of only 20 minutes. But I do this workout on my low energy days. The yoga is not the spiritual type, which is okay to do once and awhile, and it's a great muscle builder. I'm a personal trainer, and I would recommend this safe prenatal workout for all pregnant moms given the okay by their midwife or doctor to exercise.",1084752000,,559,4.0

A lot of other prenatal yoga videos out there don't do a lot of poses, but this one does, which I love.  Ohh, and having girls from different trimesters, doing different positions as some points, is a real help!!!

Leisa Hart is the best instructor, and this workout is a great MUST HAVE prenatal tool for any mom, whether its your first baby or your fourth like me. All of the reviews are so positive about Leisa, and its probably because she is so good and the results are so good.

I am 8 1/2 months pregnant now and I actually look forward to working out 3 days a week to the video.  The Salsa dancing part I still have to watch, because of the music, but I memorized the yoga routine and can watch anything on TV while I do it.  I feel so much better, physically, than I did with my first pregnancy.  Although I am gaining the same amount of weight this time, I feel more fit and definitely ready for labor and delivery and hopefully, a quick post-partum bounce back.

I sweat and stretch my muscles.  I practice my breathing, kegel exercises and abdominal exercises.  For some reason when I am walking and biking, I tend to forget to breath deeply.  I feel good after the Fit Mama workout.  I can see my body get more and more fit.  I highly recommend it.  The Latin music keeps it interesting and the exercises and dance routines are not boring.

I just had to had my own review because I was curious and rather annoyed at some peoples reviews that have said the salsa cardio routine was repetive. Well, I don't think so at all. i think that it is thorough, that Leisa safely shows you how to complete the move without being leftfooted or unbalanced, she explains it great and then puts it together. it's only 20 minutes of cardio, so how can someone expect so many different moves. Fitmama is ideal for a pregnant woman to get and keep the heart rate at a safe level. I found the entire program to be a blessing, I love that Leisa Hart produced this video. I adored her in the Buns of Steel videos, and really enjoy doing the toning and labor prep sections in Fitmama. I recommend this video to all of my girlfriends that are having babies.

Being pg, I felt unable to continue my normal activities, which was very frustrating. I'm now 6 months, and this tape is the answer to my prayers. It works all the places that were going soft, like arms and butt. It also stretches and strengthens precisely the ligaments and muscles that clench up from your expanding uterus. In addition, it strengthens your back (very important!) to help support your growing front.
In additon, Leisa Hart gives great cues, is uplifting and positive, and it's fun to watch her at 8 months being so active. The tape also includes breathing, kegels, and abdomen exercises that help you prepare specifically for birth. The stomach exercises are also safe for preventing or healing the splitting of the stomach muscles (which often happens in pregnancy).
Also, the steps are sufficiently complex to hold your interest - yet there is enough repetition so that you don't have to think too hard or become frustrated.

The same moves are taught a few times to ease the difficulity since we moms-to-be don't need to overdo it. I also really like that the work-out portions of the video are split into two portions, and more experienced exercisers can do both. And, the host Leisa Hart is excellent.

Afterwards, I felt energized and healthy.

I just bought her FitMama Postnatal videos, as well as her FitToTheCore videos, and when I read a recent review here I thought I had to finally add mine. Hart is definitely not an annoying Denise Austin or fruity Richard Simmons type, she is a straight forward, calm, positive, upbeat instructive. Her belly is so big in just workout it's amazing how good she moves. Now, the workout is not advanced level, and it shouldn't be. It's for women to stay in shape, or maintain a certain level during pregnancy, you can't be doing high intensity workouts while pregnanct. Hart's salsa dance is not repetitive and the music is not boring, its not top 40, but its good prego music. The yoga was great to tone and stretch and Hart is by far superior to other instructors that have attempted pregnancy videos(ie, Denise Austin or Kathy Smith). She is likable and genuine, not fake or wishy washy like Richard Simmons or Denise Austin. This workout has modifications that you can use, and Hart is always telling you safety cues that are improtant during pregnancy. I was absolutely blown away by her good charm and attitude, and my husband noticed a difference in my last pregnancy, my attitude was better and my stamina was better, and I owe it to Leisa Hart and her FitMama workout. I intend to buy most of her video workouts and stick with it, as she is motivating and has a body I'd like, and with good nutrition and good guidance, I just might get there.",1075852800,6,1498,4.593283582089552
1848492,2,B00008J2I7,"I was very excited about this video, especially the salsa section. I was hoping for fun and sexy with the Salsa and focused and challenging for the Yoga. When it came, I was disappointed. The music was monotonous, and both the Salsa Dance (20 min.) and Yoga Fat Burn (20 min.) routines were very repetitive. I was bored the first day.
I couldn't connect with Leisa's style. I really enjoy Denise Austin's style of encouragement and instruction (e.g., her pilates videos) and Richard Simmons energy and fun (e.g., his Sweatin to the Oldies video). I wanted this tape to be a combination of those styles, but it isn't close. If you dislike these types of instructors or tapes, you might like Leisa's style.
On the positive side: I do enjoy Leisa's 6 min. Labor and Delivery prep and her 8 min. prenatal stretch and relax. Also, the DVD quality (studio & menu selections) is very good.",1075420800,2,882,4.660256410256411

1848495,2,B00008J2I7,"this video is brutal for people who already workout. It's boring and all the breathing techniques really leave you breathless! the salsa is kind of goofy, the only good thing about this video is the end.",1075075200,,203,4.666666666666667
1848496,5,B00008J2I7,"I just received this video as a gift from my sister (who is also pregnant), and I love it. The best part about this video is how encouraging and fun Leisa is to watch.  Even if you don't get a big workout from the video, you will at least feel better just by going through the stretches and dances because Leisa is such a joy to watch.
The workout really is geared to get you limber enough for labor and provide you with stretches and exercises to do while you are in labor. Even though my heartrate didn't really increase that much with the exercises (probaby because I'm already in shape), I feel like I will be better prepared to handle the pain and discomfort of contractions. Even if you do a pilates workout (which I did before I became pregnant), these exercises are much more appropriate for labor than pilates stretches.  Plus, the video also helps put you in a positive frame of mind, which any doctor will tell you is important during pregnancy (and parenting, for that matter!).
If you're looking for a workout video to help prepare you for labor and help boost your energy, I can't think of a better instructor than Leisa Hart.  While this workout doesn't help you burn fat or really get into shape, it is still a fantastic prenatal workout that you really can't go wrong with.",1074729600,4,1290,4.480851063829787
1848497,5,B00008J2I7,"i loved this simple to follow video for my prenatal fitness program. I do not like over the top, overly talked videos. Leisa Hart is very personable and taught a great, beginner to intermediate level exercise routine. I would think that advanced exercises could still enjoy this video. The yoga was not a purist yoga section, but who cares, it was good stretching and toning for my expanding body. So many other yoga tapes are for extreme yoggies, but this tape is all that i needed during my pregnancy. I was very happy with it and am now doing the FitMama Postnatal and FitMama & Me videos, they are very good also.",1074643200,,617,4.517857142857143
1848498,5,B00008J2I7,This work out is great! I was 3 months pregnant when I started and am still doing it at 8 months pregnant. My body felts so good after the workouts. It really helps loosen you back later on in pregnacy. The salsa dance aerobic is fun and unique and the yoga fat-burn really work your buns and thighs. The best part of the video Leisa Hart. She makes you feel good about being pregnant and has a great personality on video!,1073433600,3,422,4.222222222222222

I am now doing the FitMama Postnatal video, as well as the FitMama & Me baby workout, and I cannot tell you how pleased I am with how my body has rebounded from pregnancy. Leisa Hart is so sweet and likable, i enjoy all of her new videos that I have tried (FitToTheCore Burn and FitToTheCore Chisel are incredibly great!). The best thing about my testimonial is that I am feeling great and have not had any problems getting back in shape, and I have to attribute that to the only workout I did during pregnancy, and that was this, FitMama Prenatal. You have to do these and then do the FitMama Postnatal and FitMama & Me videos, they are wonderful.",1073347200,4,786,4.35374149659864
1848500,5,B00008J2I7,"I bought this video as the weather turned bitterly cold and I could no longer continue long walks outdoors.  It is great for getting your heartrate up, breaking a light sweat, stretching and toning, and preparing for birth.  The salsa section was a little hard for me to follow at first, not being accustomed to this type of dance/exercise, but once I got the hang of it I found it a fun way to exercise.  On the DVD, there are bonus sections about moves and positions to help you during labor, provided you are not confined to a hospital bed.  I also like that once you know the routines, you can turn the narration off and just follow along with the music.
One note, the ""yoga burn"" section is not really yoga.  I like this section, but if you're accustomed to practicing yoga you may find it to be quite different from your expectations.  It is based on a few basic yoga postures, like warrior and mountain pose, but there is quite a bit of fast movement and no long, meditative poses.
I use this video alternately with ""Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga"" and find them to be excellent complements to each other.  The Prenatal Yoga video has many quiet, meditative yoga poses (modified for pregnancy) to build strength and tranquility while FitMama is fast-paced and upbeat to build cardiovascular fitness.  I am currently just a few weeks from my ""due date"" and found this to be an EXCELLENT exercise video to help me stay fit when I cannot go outdoors.",1073347200,,1452,4.5576923076923075
1848501,5,B00008J2I7,This is a great prenatal video. It doesn't get boring because you can rotate between the salsa and the pilates. Each segment is only 20 mins so you can do both if you have the time. With my first child I exercised with Denise Austin pregnancy video and I liked it. But I find this one to be a little more fun and seems to go by so fast. This is a must have if you want any kind of video while pregnant.,1072569600,2,402,3.855421686746988

1848503,5,B00008J2I7,"I have had three babies, both just about every fitness video for pregnancy, and FITMAMA is by far the Best Ever!!! The salsa was easy to learn, the yoga type toning was ideal, and the stretching and labor tips were simple and effective. Some really advanced exercisers may not think they can be challenged by this video, but they will get enough of a workout to be safe, for them and the baby in their belly. You can modify any video, but really don't have to modify FitMama. i would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you get the FitMama POSTNATAL and FITMAMA & ME videos before you deliver, they were perfect for me and I needed the Postnatal video right away, it was great with the tips Leisa offers. I have since both her other videos(as you can see, I am video junkie) and I think she has great stuff. All of the TNT Series videos are great,as are the MBC Yoga videos(if yoy have trouble finding them, her site has them), plus her Fit TO The Core and On the Ball Abs videos, I think she is the epitamy of fitness and looks great for a new mom. She looks even better a year after, and it's amazing how she does it, with simple nutrition and great planning. I love her stuff and think others should get the clue and follow a fitness expert like Leisa and not some marketing person like Richard Simmons or Denise Austin or Tony Little, they are not in Leisa's league, they are no where close. She is by far the best, and her videos prove it. I think you'll love all of the FITMAMA videos.",1070150400,5,1477,4.2785714285714285

Now that the weather is getting colder and I am exercising indoors this is the program that I know will get me through.  Energizing, invigorating and fun...I will buy both her post natal videos as well knowing that I will get what I pay for and much more!  FANTASTIC!

1848505,5,B00008J2I7,"I own almost two dozen aerobic and strength training videos.  Some offer challenging workouts. Others were a waste of time and money.  Fit Mama is my first pregnancy video (although this will be my third child).  IT IS EXCELLENT!  Here is a summary:
INTRODUCTION - Leisa Hart first tells you what to expect in her video.  She explains that the abdominal exercises have been modified to prevent the vertical muscles, the recti abdominis, from separating during pregnancy. Guidelines from the American College of OBGyNs are listed.  Leisa recommends a frequency of 3 to 4 times per week, but completing one section at a time vs. the entire 60 minutes fit my schedule better.
SALSA (20 min) - The setting is bare: one large room with hardwood floors and two glass paneled doors in back.  The participants are separated into groups.  Leisa, in her third trimester, stands in the center.  On her left are two women in their second trimester.  Two women in their first trimester are on her right.  All movements in the Salsa portion of the tape, such as the mambo cha-cha-cha, are acceptable for moms at any stage. I salsa on carpet and find it sometimes tough to slide. When Leisa introduces a new move, she performs it twice, then asks you to join her.  Her arm cues make it easy to follow along.  She frequently asks, ""How do you feel?"" so that you can monitor your intensity level.
YOGA FAT BURN (20 min) - This section helped ease my lower back pain.  Leisa focuses on breathing techniques and stresses correct knee placement.  In the Warrior position, the moms in the first tri put their hand on the floor, second tri put forearm to thigh, and Leisa places her hand on her thigh.  But she suggest you do the position most comfortable for you.  They complete 3 repetitions for each side.
LABOR AND DELIVERY PREP (6 min) - Yoga ball and strap are optional.  I had neither, but performed the exercises, like Kegels, with no trouble.  Different variations for the ab exercises match the stage of pregnancy.
PRENATAL STRETCH AND RELAX (8 min) - This sections includes cat stretches, breathing techniques, and positions for each stage of pregnancy.  Leisa inserts helpful tips, such as the importance of laying on your left side to get nutrients to the baby.",1067644800,510,2252,4.725641025641026
1848506,5,B00008J2I7,"This video is sooooo great! It all flows together, its tons of fun, and features upbeat modern music. Im only 4 months pregnant now but it seems as though it will work great for any and every trimester. The workouts themselves are not overwhelming they are just perfect. I do them everyday! I have bought other pregnancy videos and they don't compare at all. Hers is definately the best. It kicks butt!",1067299200,2,402,4.597222222222222
1848507,5,B00008J2I7,"FITMAMA IS GREAT...I usually don't bother giving reviews of videos and stuff, but after reading the ignorant review from ""Jennifer from Kennesaw, GA"" titled ""Don't be fooled by this video"", I was very annoyed with her....again, FITMAMA IS GREAT!
First, Leisa Hart was over 8 months pregnant when she produced this video. I should know, my friend was an extra on the video rehearsals, she had the same doctor as Leisa, and was due around the same time as Leisa. Leisa did not have a ""fake"" belly, that is such a stupid comment...and rude! No one would be so stupid as to choreograph and shoot a pregnancy video while not being pregnant. FYI- she had her baby the week before Christmas, and the video was shot the first week of December, so do the math Jennifer from Georgia(you must be a fake by making such a mean spirited comment, Leisa was over eight months pregnant when she filmed FitMama !
When I got pregnant earlier this year, my OB recommended this workout for several reasons. First, it was approved by several ob/gyn's for safety and effectiveness for pregnant women. The cardio keeps the heartrate at the proper level, taking into consideration all the variations of women doing the workout, and Leisa gives tips as to what you should expect. Jennifer from GA must be someone who is in great shape and when she got pregnant expected everyone else to be in top shape and can't find anything good to say about a workout that is not ""extreme"" enough for them. Kathy Smiths video is very old, outdated, with unsafe moves that are no longer part of the American College of OB/GN's guidelines, her video should be off the market! If that's what Jennifer from GA likes, then that explains the ignorance of her rude comments about this video.
I was so upset I was compelled to write some good things about FitMama, as it is a great video...but at least I know, you can't please everyone, that's our freedom to choose! But if you have negative comments, express them constructively!
Also, the toning was the yoga fat burn. That was a very effective segment, with great moves utilizing the bodies own weight as resistance. I found it to be challenging and motivating. I especially liked the breathing tips that were very straightforward and helpful with daily life.
Finally, I see Leisa Hart on tv being very professional and looking very classy, she is very fit and her approach to fitness is easy to follow, she teaches great and is a role model for many, so I give my two thumbs up to FITMAMA and highly recommend it!!!!!!",1066608000,44,2526,4.6532438478747205
1848508,5,B00008J2I7,"I got this workout tape to use in conjunction with Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga, and I am so happy that I did!  The workout starts out with an aerobic-type routine that incorporates Salsa dancing, and is set to Salsa music. Not being much of a dancer, I was a little wary of this at first, but it's actually really fun and not nearly as cheesy as I was worried that it would be. It's actually a good workout, too, and I'm always sweating by the end of it.
Next is a 20 minute yoga session, which is also a very good workout that focuses on the moves and building your strength and flexibility. The emphasis on breathing is also something that I've found myself incorporating into my daily life to help whenever the aches and pains of pregnancy start to flare up! The workout ends with some simple pregnancy-related stretches (calves, etc) and excercises (kegels, etc).
Leisa Hart is a great instructor!  She is very, very pregnant, which made me relate to her better for some reason. And she is very good-natured and upbeat without being cloying. I definitely recommend this workout for all you pregnant chicks, and am looking forward to her postnatal workout after we have our baby in December!",1066348800,7,1192,4.617924528301887
1848509,2,B00008J2I7,"I just got my Fit Mama video and it's not for me. My outdated Kathy Smith video gives me a much more well-rounded workout. I will still do my Fit Mama video, but I was deeply unimpressed.
First of all, don't be fooled. The instructor is wearing a FAKE belly which any pregnant woman should be able to recognize right off the bat.  I, at least, hoped the instructor would be pregnant for the video.
Second, I hardly got a work-out from the salsa or the yoga fat-burn.  My heart-rate didn't get even close to the 140 bps that pregnant women should try to attain.
Third, toning? I must have missed that. The toning movements were either too fast to actually make a muscle or they just didn't work for me. Maybe I'm different than everyone.
I guess the only good I got out of it was the fact that I did ""move"" for about an hour.
The Kathy Smith pregnancy video is much better in my opinion because it gives you a good toning workout as well as a good aerobic work-out. Plus, she provides pregnancy tips throughout, has you check your heart-rate, etc. The only drawback is that the moves are old. The outfits are old.  The music old.  You get the point.  Nobody snaps their fingers in aerobics classes these days and adds so much shoulder ""oomph"". Luckily, I just find it funny and I keep going along.
Maybe someone out there really likes Fit Mama. If you have some positives about the video, I'd like to hear them because I might have missed something. Like I said, I might put it in again if I just get bored with my other video. However, I would just be doing it for the sake of movement and not really anything related to a workout or making me feel better later.
Good luck ladies!",1066262400,4,1680,4.32063492063492
1848510,5,B00008J2I7,"Once I recieved the tape I could not wait to see for myself if it was all that people said it was. Once I did the routine once I noticed that it had easy to follow routines that were presented to fun, upbeat music. I love the salsa routine. It's fun while you working out. I would recomed it to any pregnant moms-to-be. It's never too late to start working out.",1066176000,,361,4.098591549295775
1848511,4,B00008J2I7,"I haven't found a pregnancy video yet that makes me feel like I've had a good workout, but at least this one comes close. I can't say that I get my heart rate up, but I guess it's better than doing nothing. The salsa dance is easy to catch on to, accompanied by good music, but rather mild in intensity level. So it's advised that experienced exercisers do the yoga fat burn afterwards. The main benefit of this section is toning (thighs) and stretching (back and sides) but it moves really slowly. I don't mind all the repetition in the video since it makes it easier to learn the moves, but I wish it had a bit more oomph to it. I still do my usual exercise videos and even step aerobics (at almost 6 months) but I think I'll be using Fit Mama more and more as I get bigger.",1064707200,7,776,4.145695364238411

I have seen and read about Leisa Hart and I absolutely loved this DVD, the music option is great and the extra photo gallery was a joy to view, it must have been a blast filming this workout tape, everyone seemed to be having a lot of un.

The cardio segment was the right level, the toning was yoga related and calming, and the labor tips were very good, even as good as my doctors tips.

1848520,5,B00008J2I7,"I was so thrilled and happy today when I did this dvd for the first time. There are so many great things about this dvd! First off Lisa is not annoying and neither are the other women in the workout. There are different women showing the different stages of pregnancy and its wonderful. In so many workout dvd's or vhs' that Ive bought either the instructor grates on my nerves after several times or there is someone in the background that likes to show off. The moves are easy to learn and you can customize them for your different stages. The music and production of this dvd are excellent, no cheap music or choppy editing like you pay for in some expensive tapes like Taebo.
First there is a 20 minutes salsa aerobic workout, low impact and easy to learn. If you have done ""The Crunch: Fatblaster Latin"" this will be especially easy to learn. Then there is a 20 minutes fat burning yoga. The great thing about the yoga segment is its not too fast but it leaves you feeling calm and energized. Then there is a 8 minutes segment of abdominal and kegel excersize, ending with a stretch.
The dvd version is only a couple dollars more and I HIGHLY reccomend buying it. It has an option that I haven't seen with my ""regular"" workouts, it lets you workout with the music but NO INSTRUCTOR TALKING! Which is great if you start using this in your first trimester, you'll probably get a little tired of hearing the queing by your 8th month.",1061078400,5,1435,4.4393939393939394

I turn her off now that I know the moves and use my own music.  I don't ever feel like I've sweated much, but I can always feel it the next day.",1060992000,,433,4.0

Its very aerobic and they don't hold the poses long enough to feel a good stretch. In my last pregnancy I did the Shiva Ray yoga workout almost every day and loved it, unfortunately, its not available on DVD yet.

The salsa is rather infectuious, it made me feel great. That FitMama Leisa Hart is so good at leading the moves, I adore her stuff. I went ahead and got her Postnatal videos and have them ready to go into the vcr as soon as i deliver.

1848524,5,B00008J2I7,"Every time I do this workout, I feel fabulous afterwards. I'm almost sorry I stopped exercising for a bit when I was in my first trimester, though I know there were times I wouldn't have been up to it. Leisa is very positive throughout the workout, and is encouraging without making you feel bad at any point. Nor is she ever annoying during this workout, which for me is a big plus with any workout video/DVD. (I find myself very unlikely to repeat a workout if the instructor annoys me.) This workout is also a lot of fun, and that's the other important thing for me with workout videos/DVDs.
The DVD version is also great because you can easily pick and choose which parts of it you want to do. You can either do all of it if you feel up to it, or just choose one of the two workouts before going onto the Labor & Delivery Prep and Prenatal Stretch & Relax, both of which I think make a great end to whatever workout you choose on this DVD. Leisa's instructions and demonstrations are also very clear and easy to follow.
I loved the regular workout DVDs/videos I did before I became pregnant (Minna and my bellydance workouts were great), but they're definitely too much for me since becoming pregnant. I highly recommend this prenatal workout and will be buying the postnatal workout, as well as looking into some of Leisa's regular workouts for later on.",1059609600,2,1359,4.483870967741935

The stretch that they do on the tape for sciatia pain SAVED me.  My pain is barely there now, thank goodness!

My wife says that Ms. Hart is the perfect person to lead the workouts  shes positive and encouraging, but never cloying or condescending. If I happen to be in the room while my wife is working out, I even find myself responding to the music and personality of this tape!
FitMama also offers solid advice for soon-to-be-moms, from workout safety to tips on delivery. Obviously, your OB/Gyn knows best, but this is good, practical information.
Plus, Ms. Harts workout-video experience means that she knows the best way to demonstrate and motivate on-cameramy wife never found herself needing to pause or rewind.
Its made my wife very happy to know she looks and feels her best during pregnancy (she said her back has never felt better), and it works out for me because everyone can see shes a M.I.L.F.!  :o)",1059436800,,1037,4.6

1848528,5,B00008J2I7,"I purchased this DVD before I even read the reviews, and I have to say, the reviews here are very accurate.  I found this to be a good workout where I wasn't going overboard like I was with my Jane Fonda regular non-pregnancy workout tapes (don't get me wrong -- her workouts are great, but not for a pregnant woman).
Leisa Harts workout includes 20 minutes of light salsa dancing, followed by 20 minutes of Yoga, 8 minutes of getting-ready-for-labor routine, and 6 minutes of stretching.  Now, I am not sure if this is really considered yoga.  However, she does call this segment a 20 minute yoga ""fat-burn"" routine.  And let me tell you -- I think that I sweated more during this segment than I did in the salsa routine!  I really felt like this section was more of a strength-training workout using your body's own resistance with a little yoga thrown in where you really concentrate on your breathing through this 20 minute yoga routine.  In other words -- I felt great!  I really felt that I was working my abs and legs, yet still concentrating on deep breathing through the exercises.
Ok -- what everyone really wants to know is what gripes do I have about this DVD.  Well, the only gripe that I have is the yoga routine.  I like the routine, don't get me wrong.  However, you will find that it is a bit repetitious.  You are doing alot of the same moves over and over.  But when I really thought about it, there aren't a whole lot of moves that a pregnant woman can do (i.e you can't do a lot of floor work because of your belly, and your center of gravity is--well--off-centered, so you have to be careful!)
In summary, GET THIS VIDEO/DVD!  Worth the money!  And keeping in shape before you go into labor will make you labor a HECK of a lot easier on you!!!
So go out and get it!!",1058659200,7,1788,4.362537764350453

I have 4 months to go, and know she will be teaching me all the way through. I bought her Postnatal videos and watched them and am excited about doing those to recover my shape after delivery.

I loved it I could easily do it without getting tired or falling behind. Leisa is so good with people you feel like she is right there with you. And she slides in comments like ""you should feel good about your growing body..."" she makes you feel healthy not fat, as we tend to feel while pregnant. The yoga part was great because you hardly feel like your exercising but it gets your heart rate up. I also liked the Yoga because it's all just moves no crazy mumbo jumbo about breathing being your life force stuff. I'm now in my 8th month of pregnancy and still doing it. The best plus for me right now is that it really does ease back pain. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the stretching part could be longer. I would also recommend Kathy Smith Pregnancy workout.",1058227200,,898,4.319526627218935
1848531,5,B00008J2I7,"I bought this tape when I was 3 months pregnant, and I'm still using it at 37 weeks! It's a simple, easy to follow workout that can be modified to your fitness level. The moves are straightforward, and Leisa Hart does a nice job of explaining safety during pregnancy as well as proper form. In my first trimester, I put a lot more ""umph"" into it -- made my movements bigger and wider, stretched more deeply, went further into the squats, etc. Now that I'm in my 36th week, I've had to modify it and follow the tape more closely to the exertion Leisa Hart is showing (she's in her 3rd trimester on the tape). All in all, a really good tape. I was pretty fit before I got pregnant, and I enjoyed doing the workout with my own modifications. Each section is about 20 minutes, and by this time in my pregnancy, that's about all I can handle at a time. I really like the yoga fat burn and the stretching.
If you're buying this early in your pregnancy, go ahead and make modifications on your own depending on your fitness level. I even used light weights earlier in my pregnancy while doing the aerobic part.
I'm looking forward to getting the post-natal workout. I like Leisa Hart's style, her instruction, and her attitude (she's cheery without being cheesy in the tape). Definately recommend it!",1058054400,9,1293,4.483050847457627

I found Leisa Hart's Yoga Fat Burner to be very good, and I totally disagree with some other reviewer, renkey, who took a rude and overlystated poor position to write a bad review of this video in her attempt to promote another video. Hart is not a yoggie, and does not claim to be one. I have had the great fortune to attend her fitness seminars around the USA and know that she is promoting a combination of yoga, tai chi and pilates based moves to tone and strenghten the inner core muscles. In FitMama, she does a great job of doing this. She is very knowledgeable on getting the maximum results for the body. Many other ""yoga experts"" do more to promote yoga principles that they in fact are neglecting the safety elements of fitness. Anyone who thinks that yoga is to be taught only by ""yoga experts"" is wrong. A fitness expert studies all forms of exercise and fitness related fields, and Leisa Hart is tremendous at doing this. She has starred in many top videos and has a broad base of fans, wisdom and conviction. She is very healthy and practices yoga weekly, as well as teaches it to fit and unfit men and women. I wish i lived in Dallas to take her classes, and they are super. FitMama was a great workout for me to do during my pregnancy and I totally loved it. She is gorgeous and exudes confidence, not arrogance like other quote video stars. I love my yoga studies, and love my belief that one can practice safe and effective teachings by listening to others and take whatever piece of wisdom that can gather and make it their own. Hart is a master instructor, and FITMAMA is a masterpiece of a prenatal workout!",1054512000,9,1727,4.4

I work my arms, abs, butt, thighs and calves. The yoga fat burn is my favorite part...it really works the thighs good! You will not be disappointed with this video.

I have tried other tapes, and not a one can compare to this FitMama tape, it is the bomb, an absolute perfect prenatal workout...i loved it and can't wait to get the postnatal.

1848538,5,B00008J2I7,"i found the amount of cardio from the salsa section to be perfect for what my body can handle, as i am not looking to tone up during this pregnancy, rather i am playing it safe and want to stay in shape. I think 20 minutes is great, and if i want to do more, i can add another 5-10 minutes of my own dance routine. The yoga is very good...i read a review someone wrote that was way off based, it sounded as if it was from a friend of another video person, Khalsa's The New Method Pre Natal Yoga, I tried that video dvd and it makes sense why that person wrote so negatively toward Fitmama; if you like that type of yoga(new method yoga), you are not going to like fitness, or if you do, you'll have your own version of safety compared to exercise pysiologists and trainers. Leisa Hart is a fitness expert, she is well known for her safety adn cueing. I have used 20 of her tapes and always loved the way she teaches and she is very highly regarded in the fitness world. Her yoga teaching may seem slow to some, but it is effective. And the points made in that review by renkey are simply not true, any fitness expert will argue that yoga experts use very poor positioning and put the body in stressful positions during certain poses, and Leisa Hart does not do that at all. Hart was 9 months pregnant during filming and she told people to be slow and safe during pregnancy workouts, she was not attempting a richard simmons sweat shop tape, and she was not trying to be a yoga guru with ancient, unsafe poses and chants. That is for some people, but thats not what I got this FitMama tape for, and I surely don't think Leisa Hart intended for anyone to think FitMama was going to be liked by yoggie purists...that review bugged me, and I think people should expect a greap prenatal workout when they buy this video. People that workout for 90 minutes a day, get pregnant, and then try to find a prenatal video to stay in shape are going to have a hard time finding anything to satisfy them, so those kind of reviews will always appear and anything with yoga will cause so-called yoga experts to question anyone from the mainstream fitness world that puts a different perspective on the fine art  of yoga combined with the science of fitness.

1848539,5,B00008J2I7,"**Note:  Since writing this review, my son is now 7 months old.  I just wanted to update to let each one of you considering this video, that after having my son, I went back to my pre-baby size!  I worked out diligently 5 days a week, once a day (sometimes twice a day) and I ate right... well, MOST of the time! ;)  This video and the other video I talk about in the following review were SERIOUSLY the best purchases I made during pregnancy.  With my first pregnancy, I was pretty much lazy and I was not so fortunate to go back to pre-baby size.  Also, lack of excersize during pregnancy made the post-baby weight loss SO difficult!!**  Now, feel free to read on for further detail! :)
I have enjoyed this video SO much! Not only do I feel 100% better after every workout, but I have noticed my overall energy level improve.
It had been well over a year since I last worked out and I was out of shape, but it has been easier (while still being effective) than I had anticipated.
I heard from some that the salsa workout was ""pointless"", but I would HAVE to disagree! It's the most fun part of the video! The first time that I used it, I found myself smiling because I was actually enjoying myself (unlike other workout videos where I find myself wondering ""Is it over yet?!"" within the first ten minutes.) I work up a sweat without feeling like I'm doing too much, too fast. It really does go at a nice, steady pace.
Leisa Hart is not too annoying to watch (as some instructors can be) and it makes it so nice that she is in her last trimester. She encourages you to go at your own pace and to remember that this workout is to keep you fit during pregnancy and to prepare you for childbirth, not as a method of weight loss.
I purchased this video at the end of my second trimester after having researched all the videos that were offered. I know that I began a bit late, but I figured that some amount of working out was better than nothing at all. I have been happy not only with the workout, but with the fact that it is not so intense that I feel intimidated.
Along with this video, I purchased Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rae (LOVE that video as well). However, unless you really enjoy yoga and meditating (as I do), you don't need a seperate yoga video. Lisa's Yoga Fat Burner is just perfect! Again, not too much, too fast and she encourages you to go at your own pace. The pace is steady and relaxing, yet it still gives you a workout.
This video gives you a well rounded workout. One that is perfect not only for pregnancy, but one that would be perfect for the first few months after pregnancy, when your body not yet ready for intense levels of workout. Not only would this help to prepare you for that time, but it will help it along a lot faster.
I highly recommend this video for people of all fitness levels as well as mothers of all trimesters.",1052092800,3,2859,4.254143646408839

She was beautiful to watch, graceful in her moves, and spunky in her salsa dance...I hope I can move like that when I'm in my last month carrying my lil baby. The other videos I've used just were boring, old, or not well thought out. It was apparent that Hart knew what she was doing. Since she has starred in 25 exercise videos, she knows how to interact on camera, which so many video instructors cannot do. I loved her style and personality, but most importantly i liked doing the exercises. Working out to a video has to be fun or else you'll never do it again, and Hart made this fun by mixing it up with some salsa dance and a yoga toning set that was great for my problem areas, and then her labor tips and the stretching was so good, my body needed it.

1848559,5,B00008J2I7,"I have every Buns of Steel video ever produced and Leisa Hart is head and shoulders above all the others, she really is one the best in the fitness industry. I love her teaching style and was so happy to see she had a prenatal workout video. I find it to be a complete mind/body workout for me and my baby. I move to good music and then relax with good music, that has to help my baby develop. I heard Hart on a tv show in Houston say that she did her MBC Yoga workout with her first baby and lost more weight afterwards than what she put on and I was so impressed. I tried her MBC Yoga videos and was doing them the first trimester until I saw Fitmama being sold. They are incredible, just what my doctor ordered. Now, if I can only lose more weight after having my baby then what I;m putting on, I'd be even happier... I loved the lenght of this workout and how it was put together. It is perfect for me in the morning, but soemtimes I find myself doing the relaxation stuff at nite and it really helps...I'm sleeping better now and attribute it to my fitness regime and Fitmama.",1047081600,5,1081,4.127962085308057
1848560,5,B00008J2I7,"i really liked the toning in this video, i'm not really a dancer, but the salsa dance was a good cardio routine, it wasn't overly dancy. I felt great doing it, but what I really liked was all the moves to help my hips, abs, [buttocks], thighs and back. My back felt really good, which was a bonus. I have had a sore back during my first pregnancys, but not this time...and I think it has to do with all the FitMama toning I've done. This will really help anyone whose experiencing back pain due to pregnancy, I'd imagine it's really going to come in handy during delivery as well.",1047081600,5,580,4.281818181818182
1848561,5,B00008J2I7,"I know how important it is to workout while prego, as my obgyn tells me to stay with it, but since i'm not paying a trainer anymore, I decide to buy 6 new prenatal videos. I have to admit, of the 6, 5 stunk(SHiva Reas Prenatal Yoga, Rockis Prenatal Yoga, Denise Austins, Kathy Smiths, and Pilates for Pregnancy)and only one made me feel like doing it again. The woman whose butt is a bit smaller in the Buns of Steel videos, Lisa Hart, is really pretty good. I never saw her predecessor Tammilee make a prenatal video, and it's probably becasue her bubble butt exploded, but Lisa looked great and sounded great. I like her style and was comfortable doing the moves. I showed the video sleeve to my doc and she was impressed, she actually went to amazon to buy one for her sister, and now she wants to bet a stock of them at her office to recommend to patients. Well, my baby is soo important to me that I figured it's worth it to try and find the right worokout for me, and FitMama is right. I think the more I do it the more results I'll get, which is really so important to me and my baby. Maybe when my baby is older we can salsa dance and he/she will remember the moves I did whilw he/she was growing inside of me.",1046995200,17,1218,4.165254237288136
1848562,5,B00008J2I7,"I wasn't sure what exercise to do during pregnancy, but Leisa Hart really made it clear and now I feel confident with the exercises I'm doing for me and my baby. This was a spectacular workout video, i flat out loved what it meant to me and my baby. I wish I could thank Leisa in person, but if others hear my successful thoughts maybe that will inspire others to stick with it and learn more as I did, she was great and I appreciated it.",1046995200,4,438,4.104651162790698
1848563,5,B00008J2I7,"i read the reviews about this video and decided to try it, and it was a great decision as this workout video was perfect for me. I thought everything from the aerobic work to the toning to the relaxation was perfect, I was really impressed. It would be perfect for anyone wanting to stay in shape during pregnancy.",1046995200,4,314,4.431034482758621
1848564,5,B00008J2I7,"i had a hard time during the first trimester, but after doing this video for a month and a half, i really feel great and rejuvenated for the rest of my pregnancy. I had tried Leisa Hart's BallAero videos from an infomercial last summer, and went I saw she was pregnant on a tv show I had to go to her website and learn more about her. I loved BallAero, and then tried her TNT Series and MBC Yoga videos and really liked them also, so when I got pregnant around Thanksgiving and struggled with the first trimester, I thought, this woman has it toghether, I should too. SO I ordered her FitMama video and I feel refreshed and ready to take on this unexpected pregnancy. I feel great doing the workout and think it will help me tremendously the rest of the way...I know it will, since after 7 weeks of doing my body feels good and I really feel great. I look forward to her postnatal video to get back into shape, I'll be a fan of hers for a long time, kinda like my mom was a Jane Fonda and Kathy SMith fan for so many years...looks like a new fitness celeb is taking over, as I saw her on an infomercial for a DirectBuy infomercial which wasn't isn't fitness related, but it was interesting, she was impressive. Oh well, I'm a new fan, and hope others realize how good this instuctor Leisa Hart is. I give her two thumbs up for FitMama.",1046995200,4,1335,4.21875
7984598,5,B00008J2I7,this was a fun and safe workout I enjoyed it while i was pregnant and also bought the other video to get back my post baby body and that one was fun and informative. I will use this with my next one.,1495929600,,199,3.761904761904762
7984599,2,B00008J2I7,"This dvd has a few sections. The Salsa section is OK.. gets you moving a bit. The Yoga Fat Burn is OK too. My biggest issue is it is incredibly repetitive and I kept wanting something MORE to happen.
She is a bit annoying too and doesn't really explain what she is doing. After a few times though you can figure it out.
I am not impressed and felt sort of bummed out afterwards.",1492473600,,378,4.121621621621622
7984600,5,B00008J2I7,Love love love this video! Truly amazing techniques.  I've lent this video to all of my pregnant friends.  If anything I would buy it for the pushing practice!  After having a V-bac with my first  child (breech baby) I needed something to boost my confidence. After two pushes and she was out!,1484006400,,293,4.576923076923077
7984601,2,B00008J2I7,I actually bought the DVD because of the Salsa workout. For anyone in my shoes: don't bother-. There is really no Salsa spirit anywhere. It's an aerobic workout with some use of the general shape of dance moves. Call it disco dancing and you are closesr....,1469059200,,257,4.608695652173913
7984602,2,B00008J2I7,"My sister gave this to me, and the writing on the cover seemed exciting. I used to dance Salsa, so there was positive association. The video was very disappointing, and I am surprised by the good reviews. The ""Salsa"" moves are VERY repetitive and not that sexy (she keeps saying sexy, which irritates me) or fun. The yoga part is strange ... not real yoga moves and awkward. Like pumping arms half way in the air without weight with exaggerated breathing. I'd rather do full range motions with real weight or real yoga poses. The yoga segment is also very repetitive. I did the entire video once, and honestly that was more than I could take. I donated the DVD immediately. I am sticking to the other 4 or 5 videos I have.",1444694400,,722,4.43609022556391
7984603,5,B00008J2I7,"I've had trouble walking my ENTIRE pregnancy from the first trimester. I ordered this and instantly fell in love with it. It is low impact for someone like myself who doesn't regularly work out but still makes me feel productive and energized after, especially with the limits that pregnancy can impose on your physical activity. Once it started to slightly wane on me, I added 2 lb hand weights and it heightened the intensity once again! I find the yoga monotonous, yet relaxing. I would recommend this for anyone! Since starting this workout at approx 26 weeks, I have not had almost any back pain and I actually feel better than I did during the majority of my 1st-2nd trimesters.",1440806400,,684,4.708333333333333
