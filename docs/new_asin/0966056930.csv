7795720,4,0966056930,Good guide to first timers.  I viewed the dvd and then went out to try my new sea kayak.  Not as easy as it looks my friends!,1367280000,,125,3.5925925925925926
7795721,5,0966056930,"Great DVD!! Good editing, Good Narration, thorough descriptions of techniques, talented paddlers.  I have learned more from this one DVD than the entire Nigel Foster's Sea Kayaking 5 volume series DVD's.  If you kayak this DVD will help.  Is this DVD put out by Dagger kayaks?",1185667200,,276,4.956521739130435
7795722,4,0966056930,"The video was very informative, well paced for the beginner as well as those of us that need a 'kayaking fix' in the cold weather. It provides clear, concise instruction/review.  I will probably wear it out!",1138579200,,207,4.75
7795723,4,0966056930,"This video is only useful as an additional instruction aid for absolute beginners to Kayaking. If you take a beginning strokes and safety course, which you should, then you'll already learn most of the information on this video. The video has so much material to cover, that it skims over each topic fairly quickly. Most all of the skills on the video are better taught by an instructor in person.

The video covers efficient and relaxed stroke techniques, wet exits, self and assisted rescues, cold-water safety, eskimo rolls, tides and currents, chart reading and navigation, and signaling for help.

This would be a useful video to own for those who are interested in the sport, but have only rented a few times, or for those who want to expose others to trying the sport.

A minor complaint of mine is that the video seems to have been filmed quite a while ago, complete with mullets and 80's-style haircuts and clothing. The self rescues section assumes that you don't have deck bungies to the rear of the cockpit, which most all kayaks come equipped with now.",1091404800,19,1065,4.745945945945946
7795724,5,0966056930,"This tape, as with any, is not a replacement for either instruction or practice.  However, the production quality is excellent and the information is presented well.  I am a whitewater kayaker and I am making the transition to sea kayaking (the body doesn't seem to recover as quickly as it use to).  I don't think the skills are broken down quite enough in the video for a ""newbie"" but, the inherent risks are emphasized and presented well so that a beginner will seek out proper instruction or apprenticeship with an experienced paddler. I can't wait to get on the water.",1011312000,,573,4.71
7795725,4,0966056930,"There aren't a whole lot of sea kayak videos out there to choose from, so there's not a lot to compare this to. However, I do highly recommend this video. It covers a lot of ground (or water, if you prefer); and it does it in a very helpful way. It covers the basics and even some more advanced topics. It's important to note that you can't really learn any of these techniques by watching a video. You can only do that by getting out on the water and paddling. However, good videos like these help you when you're out there by clueing you in to the kinds of techniques you should be learning; and helping you to visualize the motions as you're practicing them.",1005177600,4,661,4.296
7795726,5,0966056930,"Whether you're a begining paddler or someone who's been paddling for a few years, you'll be able to get something out of this tape. It features a  number of well-known West Coast sea kayak instructors demonstrating  paddling strokes, braces, rolls, and other techniques, all shown in a way  that clearly illustrates what a properly done stroke or roll should look  like. It also has good advice on trip planning, dealing with current and  tides, and many other details.
I bought this  tape based on a review in  Sewa Kayaker magazing that couldn't praise it highly enough. I wasn't  disappointed. After four years of paddling, this tape showed me what I  needed to know to move my bracing and recovery strokes up to the next  level.",966556800,26,732,4.784
