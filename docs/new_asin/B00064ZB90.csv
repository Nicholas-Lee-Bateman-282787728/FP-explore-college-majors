It is Excellent In Picture also Sound"" 5.1 Surround Dolby Digital""  Gary Moore Is Awesome to hear sing and play his many guitars"" ""To see and  hear the  legends of a lifetime, Its like being there In the audience.  Excellent Out of Print dvd to add to your to your collection, DVD is getting harder to find,Most of the dvds on the market today are Imports. Without the Import dvds today. I would never have completed some of my  collections"" I noticed on back of the artwork some songs are misprinted. On my dvd all songs are  correct. This happens sometimes with Imported dvds. If you see it on Amazon  buy the dvd  while they last. A five Star Review on the dvd!!!",1141948800,2,705,4.32824427480916
2168648,5,B00064ZB90,This is a fantastic collection. The audio quality is high and in Dolby Surround . I highly recommend this one. A++++++++++,1138838400,,122,4.857142857142857
2168649,1,B00064ZB90,"This is not an official DVD release.  It is a compressed version of the out of print laserdisc release.  Some prior reviews have commented on the video quality that is not up to DVD standards - now you know why.  Also, in order to fit laserdisc content onto smaller capacity DVD media, they not only compressed the video, but left off 3 songs that were on the laserdisc version and are still referenced on the DVD cover.  Anyone who would pay $50+ for pirated material is out of their mind.  At least have the patience and common sense to buy it off eBay at a much lower price.",1138752000,10,577,4.305555555555555
2168650,4,B00064ZB90,"I have to admit that Gary Moore is now my favourite blues guitarist!  It's his tone!  And those killer bends...he has got complete  mastery of his instrument.  Now, I love BB King.  Were would the blues be without him?  So many have learned from him.  But as in all other areas of human endeavour, there is upward progession.. and  Gary Moore is the result! The foundation was laid by BB, Peter Greene and too many others to mention. Gary aptly taps into and draws heavily from that deep well and the result is the kind of blues we've been waiting 30 years to hear!

If this DVD does anyting it proves how masterful of a blues player Gary can be.

I give it 5 stars for Gary's amazing playing but only rated 4 and probably should be like 3/3.5

The video is ok.  the sound is good. Unlike Gary at Montreaux, where the sound mix was in DTS (as in ""it don't any better than this!:) and the footage A-1..this Live Blues could have been much better.

Also this DVD is somewhat suspect. Under Ballads & Blues (there are two parts to this DVD), the package says there are 10 different videos (and so does the product description)--yet there are only 7 on the DVD! and no live versions there either!

Nevertheless--get it!  I wish I could have found it brand spanking new somwhere, but this will have to do!  Don't worry tho, you'll still be pleased you did..in fact, it's a ""must have"" for us Gary fans!",1124928000,12,1397,4.3565891472868215

8038758,5,B00064ZB90,Gary moore is undoubtably one of the greatest guitarists in the world.  The Thrill is gone with B.B. King is the best version of that song I have ever heard.  Gary's improvisational skills are  incredible.,1402444800,,205,4.8
8038759,1,B00064ZB90,This is a poorly made imprint based of Live Blues recorded at the Town and Country Club in London. The recording was released on VHS tape and if you can find a good copy the quality is far better than this DVD version. The Ballads and Blues section consists mostly of  music video clips with some live tracks. Although 10 tracks are listed on the cover only seven of them are on the DVD. The live version of Parisienne Walkways recorded at the Albert Hall with orchestra has been shortened by chopping out the middle; the cut is quite evident particularly if you compare it to the same track on the CD version of Ballads and Blues. This version does no justice to a brilliant musician.,1390521600,2,685,4.436507936507937
8038760,5,B00064ZB90,This DVD is a must for anyone that is a Gary Moore fan.  You won't be disappointed.  Get it while you can.,1376697600,,106,3.772727272727273

8038762,4,B00064ZB90,"The music was 5 stars.... the video 4. Really strange that just using a double layer DVD could have had 50% less compression and 2 none!. Why a single layer for such phenomenal offerings? One can only hope some day a double layer will show with much better video/audio like the old laser disk version. His playing is priceless and timeless no matter how the video is when the audio is still pretty good. Said it before 5 minutes of the guys playing is years of learning to the mere mortal guitar player. With B.B.King was a fantastic bonus of the two. The over abundance of feeling from the two titan's was a moment in time. Reminded me of Gary with Albert Collins at Montreux in 1990. These are rare get togethers to say the least. All of these songs were played perfect as usual and the rest of the band has to really watch his ques and they do. Never know when he is finished or improvising elseware. So whomever has the original video's > remaster to dual layer DVD's.... Worth it!

8038764,5,B00064ZB90,I just bought this very rare dvd to complete my collection!!! Gary rocks all out what a showman!! If you see it buy it this  dvd as i understand is becoming rare to find anymore. Who ever said the dvd was a copy must not have a good Television system. On the back of my dvd It has GM embossed into the silver dvd. This is no copy I did notice the back menu of songs are listed wrong. The dvd itself is correct It plays longer than listed. That tells me no songs are missing just incorrect Artwork. I give this dvd a 10+. From a Gary Moore Collectable Fan!!!,1154304000,,557,4.018018018018018
