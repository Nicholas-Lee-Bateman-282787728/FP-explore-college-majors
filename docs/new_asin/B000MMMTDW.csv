8170186,3,B000MMMTDW,"This is a film for those fans who are imaginative, creative, and have a hunger for the unusual.

Visually this was really excellent--hooray for the DP--the editing, too, was very good.  The story was a little weak as was the dialogue,but I liked how the actors handled what they had to work with. Little trouble with sound now and then, but I think we have to plan on sound problems with low-budget films.

Loved every minute and will watch it many more times.",1299283200,2,460,4.518072289156627
