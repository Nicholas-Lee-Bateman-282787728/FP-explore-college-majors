5669910,2,B00BSN0VZ2,"Park Chan-wook makes his English language debut with Stoker, a piece of gothic horror as stylized as it is shallow.

Following her father's death, India Stoke (Mia Wasikowska) meets her Uncle Charlie (Mathew Goode), a man her parents neglected to ever mention. Despite having the good looks and charms of Norman Bates, India's mother (Nicole Kidman) is taken with this mysterious uncle and invites him to stay with India and herself.

It doesn't take a lot of moody atmosphere or camera tricks to realize there's something ominous about all this, but that doesn't stop Chan and screen writer, Wentworth Miller, from piling it on thick.

Mr. Chan, the director behind modern cult classics like Old Boy and Thirst, is a virtuoso filmmaker, which Stoker continues to illustrate on a technical level. But Chan is so heavy handed with mood he threatens to suffocate the great scene chewing underneath it.

As it becomes clear Uncle Charlie's interests lie in young India, and their ties run deeper than blood and impulses, the film's sexual innuendo veers from subtly uncomfortable to explosively disturbing.

The problem is neither the writer nor the director seem to know what to do with their own material. The film possesses the ghastly twists and revelations audiences have come to expect from Chan, but where in the past he masterfully walked the tightrope between horrifying and absurd here the film plummets into the latter. And though Stoker is chalk full of forced symbolism, it starts to feel more like a mature Tim Burton film, which could be a compliment if there was some narrative substance to tent pole all that style.

The prospect of Park Chan-wook making films in English remains an exciting prospect. Though Stoker is deeply flawed, it is also often very beautiful to watch. There's no doubt Chan will be back on the tightrope for his next movie, and with any luck he'll have a better script to balance all his verve.",1364169600,12,1932,4.911042944785276
5669911,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"""Stoker"" (2013 release; 99 min.) brings the story of 18 yr. old India Stoker (played by Mia Wasikowska) and her immediate family. As the movie opens, we see that India's dad just passed away in a car accident and at the funeral India and her mom Evelyn (played by Nicole Kidman) in mourning. India then notices that there is a man watching the entire scene from afar. It turns out to be Charlie (played by Matthew Goode), the younger brother of the deceased dad who has never been around in their lives. Charlie moves in with Indian and Evelyn to help them mourning, and Evelyn seems to be much charmed by his presence. India not so much, even though Charlie give her a lot of attention. A few days later Gwendolyn (played by Jacki Weaver), a great-aunt of India, comes for a visit, to the apparent annoyance of Charlie and Evelyn, and Gwendolyn's stay is short. At that point we are about 40 min. into the movie. What is all going on here? What really happened when India's dad passed away? Will Charlie and Evelyn become lovers? What about India in all this? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is the first English-language movie directed by famed South Korean director Park Chan-wook, and he brings a very visual movie with ""Stoker"". The movie takes quite a while to build up, as I really was wondering which direction this was going to take, but the last 30 min. or so, when all is revealed, are worth the wait. In that sense, the movie is a slowburner that eventually will win you over. Mia Wasikowska's performance is the key to holding the movie together. I found Nicole Kidman's performance rather detached, although obviously she is playing the material that was given to her. Jacki Weaver's screen time is sadly very short. But in all, I thought this movie was not nearly as bad as some of the movie critics would've let me to believe.

That said, ""Stoker"" was released on just one screen in Greater Cincinnati this weekend, and despite that, when I saw it tonight (a Saturday evening), the attendance was terrible (8 people, including myself). That tells me this movie will not play long, and if you want to see this in a theatre, you'd better jump on in when you can. Or you can just wait for the DVD, of course.",1363996800,3,2331,4.534441805225653
5669912,3,B00BSN0VZ2,"""Stoker"" is South Korean director Park Chan-wook's first English-language film. After The Vengeance Trilogy (especially ""Oldboy"") and ""Thirst,"" which is one of the most original vampire films to be released in recent years, Park Chan-wook should have already been a fairly recognized name going into ""Stoker."" However, since ""Stoker"" is a bit scaled back when compared to his other works; it's a pretty solid introduction to an extremely talented filmmaker.

India (Mia Wasikowska) has just lost her father to a car accident. Since they were relatively close with one another, India isn't taking the loss very well. She is incredibly withdrawn, doesn't speak much, and her behavior is unusual. India's mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) is only barely keeping it together as she's trying to move on with her life, but her defense mechanism kicks in whenever somebody brings up her husband's name. Charlie (Matthew Goode), an uncle India never even knew existed, moves in and makes matters even more uncomfortable than they already are. His questionable motives only pique India's fascination with Charlie and the Stoker family becomes more than a little unsettling because of it.

The opening and ending credits make it a point to be unlike most credit sequences out there. The text in the opening of the film interacts with whoever is on-screen like when Mia Wasikowska walks across a road in the middle of nowhere and her name slowly disappears as she walks towards it. The end credits scroll the opposite way you're used to; from top to bottom rather than bottom to top. Pay particular attention to how sound is utilized. The metronome sequence is done extremely well as is the importance of a ringing phone.

The psychological thriller heavily relies on creepy and disturbing behavior that continues to snowball throughout its 98-minute duration. We witness India pop a blister on her toe and the film plays with how keen her sense of hearing is. The long-shot of the camera following India through the house is intriguing, but even more so is the way the film transitions from one scene to the next; a hard-boiled egg slowly turns into India's eye and Evelyn's brushed hair becomes the tall grass in the field India and her father are hunting in.

The Uncle Charlie character causes every situation to almost feel like a bad punch line to what was already a really bad joke to begin with. These situations make your upper lip curl, your nostrils flare, and your face distort automatically in disgust. Charlie's dialogue alone (""India practically licked it clean"") is awkward enough, but he hangs out at her high school, makes out with her mom when he knows she's watching, and makes playing piano with someone feel like a porno. However, the film is supposed to make you fidget in your seat and make you uneasy and ""Stoker"" is able to do this with the greatest of ease.

You're immediately drawn to everyone's eyes in the film. The dinner scene where Charlie lets India drink some of his wine is what first comes to mind, but Evelyn's speech to India near the end of the film is also a great example. Their eyes are just so absorbing, unflinching, and cold. They seem almost completely absent of typical human behavior.

""Stoker"" has many similarities to ""Oldboy"" that seem to have become Park Chan-wook's trademarks; whistling is to ""Stoker"" what humming is to ""Oldboy,"" there's a big emphasis on wrapped gifts that is shrouded in mystery in both films, and incest has practically become an ongoing theme for Park Chan-wook. Mia Wasikowska delivers what is surely to be the biggest WTF shower sequence of the year, but ""Stoker"" also manages to put a spin on household items that will never make you look at them the same way again. It was a hammer in ""Oldboy,"" in ""Stoker"" it's belts, garden shears, and snow angels.

""Stoker"" lacks the bite that Park Chan-wook's South Korean films deliver and doesn't punch you in the gut and kick you while you're down nearly as hard as The Vengeance Trilogy does, but ""Stoker"" is still undeniably unsettling and an expertly crafted thriller.",1363305600,2,4079,4.894356005788712

Another masterpiece by Park, who playfully, coldly and ruthlessly explores the darkness of the human psyche.

The movie is not only as good as the trailer, but hugely better and even more mysterious and captivating. It simply blows your mind away. Fortunately, I ignored the negative Anglophobe reviews and watched it. It's the most complete artistic work by Chan-wook Park in his career so far, an ingenious masterpiece, with the only minor complaint being the lack of the explicit violence he depicts in his Korean movies; this is not his fault though, but the request of the American companies involved, and still he manages to make us shiver with the cruelty of the violent scenes depicted and insinuated.

To fully appreciate this movie, you must have watched Old Boy and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and in general to be a fan of Korean and Japanese cinema. The script is excellent, violent, unpredicted, the plot mysterious and sinister, and not for those who love the silliness of American spoon-fed cinema. If you don't like or understand international cinema, then don't bother. This movie and Matthew Goode's performance are Oscar material, if Oscars were not political travesties.

I have never watched such a cinematic masterpiece before. Highly stylised, every move, every word, the posture of the actors, every tiny detail has a meaning. The mansion filmed on location has an ominous air of decadence. The plot is clearly outlined: India is a strange girl, with something dark and off about her. Her mother is a depressed rich stay-at-home housewife, and we understand that her marriage has become a chore. When India's father has a mysterious car accident, uncle Charlie, an unbelievably handsome man, suddenly appears. And bad things start happening. Who, what and why? The movie builds up the plot and the suspension like a dance or the notes of a symphony! This is something I have felt with other movies by Park, and they are the only movies I watch again and again to fully take in and appreciate every detail, and the beautiful music throughout. Little by little, every nod, word, step, bring us to the climax, to the end, the answer to the questions and the harsh reality. There are no easy supernatural explanations here. Only the malevolence of the human heart.",1362960000,78,2314,4.940874035989717
5669914,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"Watch this movie if you've a fetish for one or more of the following:

(1) Mia Wasikowska, the hot lead actress;
(2) Nicole Kidman, second lead actress;
(3) Dresses;
(4) Shoes.
(5) Mia Wasikowska, the hot lead actress!

The storyline is about how a girl (yeah, how else do you get male audiences to pay for a movie?) grows up and discovers her hidden self with the ""help"" of a secretive and dangerously obsessive uncle. Imagine an older man (in this case an uncle) constantly obsessing over his little niece (you get the idea!) and killing people just so that he can be with her.

It's quite challenging to classify this thriller. Interesting directorship is all I can say for now. The director is Korean and if you've watched Korean or Jap movies, you know that they're seldom in a rush to hurriedly chase scene after scene in a fraction of a second like a Hollywood quickie. This trait alone should be appreciated, although it can seem to bore some people who are hooked only onto Hollywood action films. This is not a Hollywood action movie.

IMO, it worth a watch!",1362700800,7,1068,4.575916230366492

A typical (((Hollywood))) movie -- beauty defiled by the beast.

Physical Beauty:  The film's scenery is beautiful -- an inviting early 20th century house nestled  in a peaceful  pastoral setting;  the actors and interiors are filmed from artistic angles and in lush colors. Unusual, tasteful furnishings delight the eye -- from the golden peacock headboard of India's bed to the plush reds of her mother's bedroom.  Well dressed guests converse pleasantly at  a funeral reception for India's father.  India  and her Uncle Charlie play beautiful piano compositions.

The physical beauty is accompanied by touches of moral beauty:  A loyal housekeeper and a concerned aunt  anticipate trouble and try to  protect  India  from  Uncle Charlie.  A beautiful mother (Nicole Kidman) seeks emotional closeness with her daughter (but is rebuffed).  Hollywood swirls its paintbox of beauteous colors over the surface of the film.

Now the typical down and dirty  (((Hollywood)))  ""fun"" begins.

The nastiness of the  Hollywood Group  Mind  defiles every bit of  Beauty that  has been artfully constructed.  Hollywood's core degeneracy drives every turn of the putrid plot,  which wends its way from one degrading scene to another, despoiling  the beauty of man and nature.

The Beastly Hollywood  Plot:
A father  neglects his wife to bond with his young daughter;  they bond by killing animals. India's father teaches her to shoot birds --  in an explosion of guts and blood.  (Intimations of pedophilia.)
Handsome white teenage males are turned into cartoon male figures who express  their attraction to India  through violence -- by attempting to humiliate, mock and rape her.  (Perversion of Normal Heterosexual Relations.)
The housekeeper and the aunt are murdered.
Uncle Charlie murders India's father. (Sibling Jealousy and Homoeroticism.)
The food freezer in the basement of the house contains  the dismembered heads of Uncle Charlie's murder victims. (Cannabalism.)
The beauty of the music played by India is debased when Uncle Charlie joins her in a piano duet that simulates copulation. (Proxy Incest.)
As India takes a shower; she is aroused to orgasm by her memories of the murder of her male rapist. (Porn. Snuff film. Yuk.)
Uncle Charlie  tries to rape and murder India's mother. (Violent porn.)
After shooting her murderous Uncle Charlie, India drives away from home in a car and speeds down the road.  She defies the speed limit on purpose. When a State Trooper stops India for speeding, she stabs him in the neck with pruning shears. For psychopaths,  all human laws  and codes of behavior exist only to be  broken and defied.

India is a metaphor for the (((Group Inbreds of Hollywood))) -- a  glamorous surface mask over a rotten soul.
Someone needs to put a strait jacket on Hollywood's inbred, generational insanity -- or, better yet, someone should build a high brick wall around  Hollywood --  to see what,  if anything vaguely resembling humanity, emerges after fifty years.

According to Wikipedia, ""Stoker""  was directed by a South Korean admired by  Quentin Tarantino.  No surprise here; Taranatino is  the King of Gore-fests, such as  ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill""  whose ugliness was masked by the pretty faces of  Uma Thurman, John Travolta, and Bruce Willis....  Evidently,  Hollywood's mental illness is contagious.

According to Wikipedia, the film was produced by the talented director Tony Scott, who committed suicide by leaping from a bridge.",1504396800,,3495,5.241818181818182

5669922,1,B00BSN0VZ2,"After decades of watching movies I can rely on my gut feeling, as I could with Stoker. The movie had something disgusting from me since it was announced. Partly because of the fact that Matthew Goode basically always plays perverse roles in perverse films (e.g. Watchmen) and is nothing but repulsive to me, and also the plot didn't appeal to me at all. Ultimately, I wanted to give the script of Wentworth Miller and the cooperation of the sympathetic Lucas Till a chance - I shouldn't have. Fans of Lucas Till or the hyped Alden Ehrenreich will not get happy, and the rest is just plain disgusting, stereotypical clichs. I really do not know what is interesting about all the disgusting sex topic, that it sells so well - mankind is just disgusting. But it is particularly disgusting when men think they can / may tackle topics such as the awakening of female sexuality (in addition: uninteresting and supercliched) or rape (see the repulsive and senseless piece of work ""The free will"") - this is what I expect from fat, disgusting, horny heterosexuals like George L. Martin, but that such pulp was conceived by Wentworth Miller is horrifying. The only explanation could be that he did not have his Coming Out yet when writing the script, and that he wanted to camouflage himself as the type described above. In the end, the film is nothing more than stylishly executed pulp of the lowest category, with all disgusting stereotypes such as the men horny widow and the daughter aroused by perversities (just as the horny Neandertals imagine it to be), but also the adolescent who is quickly ready to rape the girl of his dreams. There is only one finding you can take away from this movie/ see confirmed by this movie: people who are delighted to murder defenseless animals, and then even perversely call it a sport, are dangerous, disgusting psychopaths who do not stop for humans either (who, however, are at least usually less innocent than the animals).

5669964,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"Incredible and underrated. This movie is richly layered both visually and plot wise. The cinematography alone I could write about for paragraphs. Each shot leads into the next, and provokes you to question each character's motives and leads further into India's psychological and sexual growth into a woman. It's one of the most visually striking movies I've ever seen. It's clear each shot was chosen carefully. As for the editing--that too is phenomenal. In the trailer you can watch Nicole kid man's hair become grass through a seamless transition--this film is full of those well selected gems.

As for the acting--that too is amazing. And who can complain with this cast--the well-loved Mia Wasikowska as the ingenue with deep but hidden emotions, Nicole Kidman as the lonely mother, and of course, Matthew William Goude. I didn't know this actor very well before this movie--but by God, he deserves some recognition. The whole movie, he plays him subtly off. Not incredibly overt, but enough to make you question his charm.

This is an artistic, gorgeous film. If you aren't passionate about films being visually compelling, this might not draw you in. However, if you love to analyze movies, if you love to take in each line of a script, and each character placement--then this movie is a goldmine. It's subtle and thoughtful.

As for the plot itself--it's a coming of age story with a dark twist. I found myself the whole time routing for India to grow into something dark, something dangerous. I was not disappointed. India is like an egg yet to be hatched at the beginning of the movie, and it is incredible to see what she becomes. This movie goes to the darkest places, and the musical score leads you there wonderfully.

Nicole Kidman has only a supporting role as Indias mother so we don't get to see a lot of her in this film.

5669981,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"This film is all about Charlie Stoker/Matthew Goode, who attends his brothers funeral.  He is creepy.  His gaze intense, leery, and deeply unsettling.  He wears the hint of a smile.  It is clear that he is not right, and his fascination with India is instant and baffling.  Starting before they have even met.  Why  we do not know.  He explains he wants to be her friend.  He is overt in declaring his interest.  He teases her.  He has never met her before, but he is certain she is his soul mate.

And he is right.

For India/Mia Waskowska is not all that sweet.  She savors the morbid and the gory, and she is without fear.  Because she is not unattractive, her male peers are intrigued, and attempt to get a rise out of her.  And rather than be daunted by a lewd sketch, she continues as is, and in confronting them, she is calm.  You think she is upset witnessing a murder, but her true reaction as the camera spans lower is a surprise.

You know though there is something wrong with Charlie Stoker, the uncle India never knew existed until her father died, there is something wildly seductive, even sexy about him.  I understand how others were intrigued.  He is handsome.  He says the right things.  He knows how to manipulate.  He is a confident liar.  Charlie is a hurt misunderstood being, as is India.  They are almost the same.

There are gaps in the film.  Like the how or why of Charlie being so focused on India, though he had never even met her.  Id like to think Charlies brother, Indias father, shared some of Indias interests, and Charlie became intrigued by a description of the habits of his niece.  He sought a connection.  Or maybe Charlie wanted India because Indias father loved India so much, and Charlie loved his brother, and India was a substitute.  I don't know.  But if India had been a different kind of person, their meeting would not have been as dynamic.

Nicole Kidman, always perfection and glorious, has the thankless role as Indias mother  still in grief, still trying to love India, still irritating, and she was out of place.

I enjoyed the film, though I questioned some of the premise.  Charlies strange affection for India was unnerving  beginning before he met her.  Matthew Goode said in the bonus features that only Charlie knows what he wants, which added some insight because Charlie is so warped.  I don't expect logic, but Id like some kind of explanation, because I cant always find credibility in that leap.  That Charlie hit a bulls-eye is difficult to believe.

Sometimes I turned away, or cringed while looking - and that is because of India.  Savoring a needle puncturing a blister.  The slow shaving of a bloody pencil.  An awkward seduction while playing the piano.  Her strange ecstatic snow angel in bed.  India is disturbed, and she and Charlie have a lot in common.

This film is intriguing.  This is Matthew Goodes film.  So perfect, so off, and yet, so darn mesmerizing.  You know there is something wrong with Charlie, but you don't know what, and you keep watching and watching for that thing you suspect to happen, and when it does it is too late.  Charlie is utterly confident, so others are afraid of confronting him.

I crave to see it again.",1435968000,4,3212,4.584805653710247

5669998,1,B00BSN0VZ2,"I was struck by the visual impact of this movie, even though some of the work got in the way--such as freezing the picture a bit too much in the opening, which got to be more annoying than meaningful by the end of that scene.  The scenes throughout the rest of the movie are slow, almost lovingly drawn, sometimes at odd angles and cut together with pieces of flashbacks and other scenes so that time really makes no sense.  It made me think that the main character, India, really had mental issues, much more so than her belief that she can see and hear things that others can't.  But, about half-way through the movie, this approach to the filming lost its interest and became tedious instead...and I found myself skipping ahead and finally just shutting off the movie as I had lost interest in the characters and in what may or may not be happening to them.

The plot (if there really was a plot) was taking second place to the dark, drawn-out quality of the filming, as was any hint at character development.  India was just as mixed up and messed up and strange, her mother (in a character that took no advantage of Nicole Kidman) was flat and uninteresting and obvious, and her uncle was just a cold menacing character who was supposed to be broody and sexy and scary, but was just clearly a killer taking advantage of a situation and I honestly couldn't care less about any of them.  Basically, India's father has died, her uncle (if he really is her uncle) has moved in and is seducing both mother and daughter and murdering people...that's about it.  The rest is all mood pieces that make little sense.

This is clearly just a collection of dark and strange pieces with barely a nod at a real story.  If the plot isn't there and the characters are boring and cardboard, then this is just bad writing and/or bad directing.  I can't recommend this movie.  I can't even really say what the director meant by it, save to show how nifty-keen they must be to make something so clearly different from other movies, but it came across instead as pretentious and artsy, and not in a good way.

This could have been good if the characters had been believable and they hadn't tried so hard to make the movie seem out of the box.  When the way you film and cut and direct a movie gets in the way of telling a good story, then it is part of the problem.  Too bad.",1421020800,5,2359,4.405529953917051

The uncle comes into the life of the grieving widow and daughter and creates a change in their lives that the daughter clings to and finds purpose in her life.  I don't want to say too much because it will give away the movie before a person has a chance to see it for the first time.

5670016,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"This was a strange movie to categorize as it has elements of a coming of age drama mixed with mystery, crime, horror and maybe even black comedy.  It was basically the story of a teenager India (Mia Wasikowska) who loses her father in a somewhat mysterious car accident.  During the funeral, her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), who India wasn't even aware existed, shows up and enters India's and her Mother's (Nicole Kidman) life.  Some creepy things (stalking, people dying etc.) start happening and the movie kept me guessing as to what is really going on (i.e., is Uncle Charlie real or a figment of India's imagination?).  The slow pacing and oddness of the 3 main characters (they all seemed mentally unbalanced) contributed greatly to the mystery.

I would have liked the film a lot more if not for the following reason:
*SPOILER ALERT*  I felt that the final sequence of the film was unnecessary and put a very negative spin on the film for me.  One of the things that I feel any film needs is something or someone that I care about.  Prior to the final film sequence, India's actions could be viewed as redemptive.  However, the final sequence in my opinion renders her as just another psychopath.  Therefore, I ended up not caring about the film's outcome or any of the people in the film.  The sequence felt tacked on just to add another big twist and some violence.  Just my thoughts.",1408060800,2,1395,4.672131147540983

There are so many actors/actresses who don't know how to navigate that type of role without seeming like an automaton. She's better than some, but ultimately boring in her efforts.

The ingredients were there, but they weren't the quality necessary to make me actually like this film. However, it was decent enough that I actually finished it, especially after choosing it at random.

Usually, if a movie doesn't get me within the first 5-10 minutes, I turn it off. Because the style of the film and the story itself was very good, I watched it until the end. I simply did not like the movie as a whole. Seems like a contradiction, but there it is.",1402358400,,980,4.3497267759562845

I loved the imagery, and thought all performances were strong, from the leads to support actors. Matthew Goode was very convincing as a charming sociopath, and Nicole Kidman played her role very well too. Mia Wasikowska was well cast in the role of a teenager with more to her than meets the eye.

The second time I saw it, I was much more impressed, while the story is still the weak point of the film, everything else shines, the cinematography, the score, the acting, and the mood. There are some great moments here, and there are enough to enjoy this film.",1400976000,,735,4.287769784172662

5670025,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"This is a dark ""bildungsroman"", as the Germanic literary term depicts, a tumultuous and romantic ""education of the young romantic"". Good examples are ""Jane Eyre,"" Great Expectations"", ""The Scarlet and the Black"", and among the best, James Joyce's ""The Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man"". While it would be outrageous to suggest that this movie belongs in this exalted company, it is by far one of the best films I have seen that even approaches these masterpieces, outside of David Lean's fabulous cinematic adaption of ""Great Expectations"". It is interesting, since clearly India herself is clearly unhinged, to determine how many of her perceptions are real, and how many are simply the delusions of a troubled mind. Many questions are unclear: Does the evil Uncle really exist? Does India herself murder him or the mother? Is Grandma really in the freezer? Nevertheless, fabulous performances all around, a sumptuous presentation of sets, a great soundtrack, all highlight a really great ""alternative"" film.

5670026,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"Masterful direction, impeccable acting. The story is fairly simple, but Chan-wook explores every conceivable emotional nuance between characters through his surgically precise, intensely visual style. Sequences are chopped up and paralleled for maximum dramatic effect, and the audience is led through a series of darkly whimsical, shocking crescendos. All three actors fully inhabit their larger-than-life roles, saturating each character with lush, human vulnerabilities, absent which they might feel campy or mechanical, due to the meticulous, rigidly controlled mechanism they traverse. The whole affair seethes and oozes into a vivid, disturbing, syrupy confection that Chan-wook throws in our faces with giddy abandon. Highly Recommended.",1396656000,,744,6.233009708737864

5670030,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"A beautifully-shot film; director Park Chan-wook and DP Chung Chung-hoon compose their images like painters. Perhaps the best sound I've ever heard in any film; the lead character mentions at the beginning that she can hear things that no one else can, and the movie demonstrates that to the audience throughout. I'm not a big tech guy, but you don't have to be to appreciate the sound in this. Another great score from Clint Mansell, who I've come to think of as the best in the business. All of it tied together by a story and script that, while not ground-breaking, work fine in the service of one of the best sensual experiences I've ever had with any film, and great performances from the three leads that provide some genuinely evocative moments. I'm shocked that this didn't get a technical nomination or two from the Academy, but it's easily my favorite film of 2013, and my opinion the best work of Park's widely-lauded career.

5670034,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"I thought all the actors played their role stellarly.  Matthew Goode was hypnotically alluring and Mia is a superb up and coming actress.  I saw her in Jane Eyre and she was superb.  This movie you do have to watch several times to get all the symbolism that the director wants the viewer to get, and you do.  You start to connect the dots.  The movie has its perverse aspects but I was very taken with the relationship between Charlie and India.  Blood is blood, and certain Lazos Perversos (perverse ties) are not easily broken or controlled.  They are part of the ancestral family tree, all the good and all the bad.  Many affinities are there in Charlie's and India's DNA.  Loved their piano duet; their familial chemistry.  It is in that scene that they both bond and realize that they understand each other very well.  They are family.
I recommend this very serious movie highly.  I get it.  :)",1391126400,4,900,4.55
5670035,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"While watching, I actually thought, ""Wow.  If Jerry Brudos were still alive, he'd really like this film.""  After all, there were at least a couple of major plot elements that Mr. Brudos would like about ""Stoker.""  But Mr. Brudos didn't really have good taste overall, so maybe he wouldn't like this film after all?

If the first paragraph is a little too obscure, you may surely do a quick Google search and get a good idea to what I'm referring.  But I would recommend against it I suppose, as it might be a minor spoiler.  Even still, after watching this film, I'm not completely sure that I even understand what it's completely about myself.

But I surely did appreciate it.  The art direction is fantastic in nearly every way, and there was one scene in particular that I liked:  there was a fade-in to an outdoor scene, and it looked to me just like a Renoir painting.  Renoir was one of the only ""modernists"" that I actually like, if you could consider him ""modern"" though.  After all, most of his life took place in the 1800s, so most people probably consider him to be old fashioned.

And this film has some old fashioned elements to it as well.  Note the script on some hand-written letters at one point; it looks like something written for the film ""Dracula.""  (When I first heard the title for the film, I thought of ""Dracula"" because of the obvious Bram Stoker connection.  Was that intended by the screenwriter?)  And ""Stoker"" feels like an Indie film, albeit an Indie film with a whole lot of money thrown at it.  Money that, from most reviews so far, looks like it was perhaps wasted.

But it wasn't wasted on me.  While I surely wouldn't consider this to be a ""masterpiece,"" it is really good, and the acting is top notch.  In particular, I really liked Mia Wasikowska who has the lead role.  She has that Christina-Ricci-thing going on, although I believe that Ms. Wasikowska is a better actress than Ms. Ricci.  (Sorry, Ricci fans.  Hey, I happen to be a minor fan myself.)  Matthew Goode is very good himself, and of course Nicole Kidman puts out her standard stellar performance.  (If I were a director, I would give a sigh of relief if Ms. Kidman signed on to do my film.  Why?  Well, you wouldn't have to worry about her.  You know that she's always going to ""bring it"" with every role.)

What is this film about, though?  Well, besides the hints that I gave in the first paragraph, it's not completely clear, even after a viewing.  It's difficult to tell even while watching what is real, and what is imagined.  I will say though that it seems like a major theme is ""Crazy doesn't fall far from the tree.""  But if you wanted to discuss plot, this film has a real non-linear narrative going on with lots of flashbacks, and scenes that might be confusing.  This is surely not for the masses, but I really liked it a lot.

And once again, Mr. Brudos would surely like to take a peek at this, wherever he is, most likely in the same place as some of the unfortunate characters in this film.  And he's only slightly less sympathetic than quite a few characters here, as they have some very odd hobbies themselves.",1390176000,2,3131,4.48936170212766

The beauty of this release is, well, the beauty.  Chan-wook Park and his team created a stunning, gorgeous, and very moody film; a film with a unique look, with precise color schemes and breathtaking textures.  And this disc captures all of it.  You can't really ask for a better transfer.

The film itself is compelling and, in my opinion, one of the truly unique films in recent years, especially thematically.  And as I said, the performances, especially among the three principles (Wiakowski, Goode, and Kidman), are just everything one could hope for.

Mysterious, dark, quirky, brooding and heavily atmospheric. Also, it seemed that the characters had room to grow and explore themselves, each other and their surroundings. But as time went by, even when you discovered the ""secret"" of Uncle Charlie (through the eyes of India at first and later through Charlie's), nothing ever really seemed to escalate, to reach a level of that illusive ""something"" that grips you and makes you feel for the characters, a feeling of understanding behind their personal motivation/troubles/actions. Basically all three main characters are rather static, and I felt drawn to none of them....repulsed by them at times (which is the most emotion this movie made me feel), but overall a complete lack of indifference that any of them should live or die. I felt sorry for none of them, and the character in the film that garnered any positive feelings on my part was Richard (India's father), whom you only really see (in flashbacks) in the last 20-25 minutes of the film.

5670042,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"Nine Things about Stoker (USA, Britain, 2013)

1. This little thriller about an extremely dysfunctional family is one of the best films of 2013.

2. Its kind of like Hamlet, only more modern, gothic, and psychotic.

3. It stars Mia Wasikowska (who played Alice in Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland), Matthew Goode (who played Ozymandias in Watchmen), and Nicole Kidman.

4. Its about a girl, India, who celebrates her 18th birthday on the same day her father dies. When her uncle Charlie comes to the funeral, he moves in.

5. Uncle Charlie inadvertently awakens erotic feelings in India. As well as something darker.

6. I thought I knew where the movie was going, but it fooled me.

7. It was directed by Park Chan-wook, director of the famous Vengeance Trilogy (most Americans have only heard of the second film, Oldboy). This is his first English-language film.

8. The camera work is superb, as is the soundtrack.

9. There are many moments in the film that have double meanings. As perhaps the best example, finish the film and then go back and watch the first 60 seconds of the beginning again.",1388880000,2,1099,4.742105263157895

5670047,2,B00BSN0VZ2,"I read another online review that claimed ""style with no substance"", which I think pretty much sums up this arthouse garbage. I will say I do like Park Chan Wook's Korean films, yet I was leery after watching the trailer for ""Stoker"". I am certainly no film critic, but I do watch a fair amount of independent and foreign film.  The robotic, well dressed characters meandered in a very slowly paced stylish backdrop that was quite nauseating in its lack of substance.  The character ""India"" was yet another intelligent, misunderstood, enigmatic young lady of whom we are supposed to see an an unsolvable puzzle, I suppose.  She slinks throughout the movie as we watch spiders slither up her legs and hear the background noises of her breathing and chewing food, all in the context of her supernatural ability to hear and see what others cannot. ""No one gets me"" is the recurrenty them of the pale dark haired child.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful, of course, but has no real character development.  She seems so generic to me, as usual.  Honestly, she could have been left out completely, or played better by a dozen other actresses. She plays the sophisticated, yet cold, mother whom India feels no real connection to, so we see a few cold glances and pouty tantrums thrown from her direction as she competes for the attention of the suave, handsome uncle.  Speaking of the uncle, I found him to be the most rediculous character.  The handsome stranger that stares intensely at everything and everyone as if he holds the meaning of the universe in his skull.  He carries not only mystery behind his arrival, but also the ability to speak foreign languages fluently, play as an expert pianist, charm everything male and female, and the culinary skills of a master French chef.  **Spoiler*** All this while being held in a mental asylum since childhood. Honestly the writing felt like a mixture of a cheap V.C. Andrews novel and somewhere just above ""Twilight"".  Beautiful people, beautiful homes, wealth and high class drawn out in a paint drying pace by flat, bored looking actors.  No real action, no real chemistry.

5670050,3,B00BSN0VZ2,"Stoker's first and main flaw is why Charlie is so infatuated with India? He's been in an institution for at least 30 years. How does he even know about her?
Also in the short time Charlie has been ""back home"" his brother has died in a car crash, and 3 people (The caretaker, Aunt Gin and India's seeming protector from school) have gone missing, but the Police Chief questions India? WTF? It has to be known that Charlie was recently released from an institution (and why he was institutionalized) and yet the police don't even question him?

Also the boy from school who defended her suddenly turns into a rapist? And Charlie has somehow followed India and the boy the whole time, when at the onset he was engaged with India's mother when she ran off into the woods?

""Only in witnessing death are we truly aware, and only in causing death are we truly alive...""

Murders? Hello

Missing  persons? Hello

Mia Wasikowska (The Kids Are Alright, Jane Eyre), is a delightful young actress, but is somewhat confined to a dark, somber and restrained but necessary portrayal (with the exception of that shower scene) though we never see how or why this behavior originated (She out Wednesday's Addams' Wednesday!). We see a scene with her father, who like Dexter's, is trying to persuade her motivations towards small and concise acts, in the hope of preventing death on a grander scale. But she also obviously has some connection with Uncle Charlie but, again, how? Psychic? Genetic? It almost seems like India is Charlie's child but that's impossible within the films' time line. And what's with the shoes? Sexual awakening is inextricably linked to a pair of Jimmy Choo's?

Nicole Kidman has the ungainly part of the distressed widow, who has to deal with her subsequent repressed sexuality that's awakened by Charlie, but who seems to have been lost and medicated long before Richard's death... But again we're never privy to her shocked, drugged, jealous world...  Shocked, lost,  medicated... Why? Has she always been jealous of India?

I've said nothing about Matthew Goode here... Purposefully... Pretty face... An antagonist of beauty and nothing more... Usually the realm of the femme fatale...

And Uncle Charlie? Wasn't that Joseph Cotton's name in Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" about a murdering uncle?... Homage?

5670056,3,B00BSN0VZ2,"Mia Wasikowska stars in a movie that requires a tremendous amount of patience on your part to appreciate since let's be honest, the first 30 minutes are reprehensible- this portion of the film is all about Mia's character roaming around the house and doing very little in the way of anything significant for storyline purposes.  Your impression here is that Stoker isn't going to be the horror or suspense you're looking for, and even though the film improves later on, you'd still be correct about that.  This is not a horror or suspense.  It's a slow-moving, overproduced Twilight-resembling horror movie for people who can't handle true horror.  Certainly several notches below a *real* horror such as another movie I also watched today called Silent Night.  It's extremely slow-moving and ineffective, believe me.

It's basically about Mia being an introverted and shy teenage girl that gets picked on at school by a few guys for being so different, and even has to defend herself against one of them one night during a night of fun gone wrong that involves rape (which results in one of only two actual parts in the movie that *almost* comes close to providing suspense, both involving belts interestingly enough).  Mia's uncle moves in and lives with her family, and it's soon discovered that he's a murderer.  He's definitely the source of confusion when it comes to trying to understand the storyline, that's for sure.

This storyline is definitely one of the more confusing ones out there.  There's a scene later on when the uncle is sitting in the car with another man, and a little boy is making snow angels in the dirt as a pushmower moves forward mowing by itself.  The segments with Mia walking to the basement and discovering unusual things in the freezer are equally confusing, not to mention a failed attempt at being atmospheric and frightening as well.  These parts of Stoker make zero sense to me, and eventually the movie reverts back to being boring and confusing like it was in the beginning when Mia was allowing spiders to crawl up her legs.  However if you interpret all this confusion to simply mean the uncle is a psychotic murderer, which is the safe and logical route, than you'd probably be able to appreciate/understand this movie better.  When the relationship between Mia and her uncle builds and becomes intimate, and when the mother makes a few appearances (who has her own relationship with the uncle apparently)... now I'm *really* lost.

I do love the piano scene however, where Mia and her uncle play an extended piano piece together (even though Mia was obviously uncomfortable doing so!)  The music played here is terrific, and a wonderful moment of writing.  I also like how, in the very next segment, Nancy Sinatra's ""Summer Wine"" plays.  Interesting sidenote- I knew it was Nancy Sinatra the moment the song began and this is the first time I've even heard the song!  She has a distinct voice and is famous for another classic song in ""Some Velvet Morning"" with Lee Hazlewood.  That's how I knew it was her.

Needless to say, Stoker is a strange movie but it's not bad enough to place it with the 1-star reviews you see here on amazon.  Some of the storytelling makes sense, and some of it is even interesting (such as the middle part of the movie).  It's the slow beginning and the confusing 20 minutes near the end that raises a feeling of uncertainty.  At least the two bloody scenes at the very end are magnificent.",1386374400,,3464,4.773489932885906

5670061,2,B00BSN0VZ2,"reminded me abit of the crazy character in Shirley Jackson's We Have Always Lived In The Castle. That's one of my favorite crazy characters and you don't often see her ilk in films, played this way: this character is sort of old school. Didn't like the movie so much because it was obvious the girl was off, the uncle odd, and the mother was unusual in her reaction to her loss (seeming to want to be forced into sex with her dead husband's brother), so there was no one for me to root for. The character's bizarre behavior kept me emotionally out of the story, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Also, didn't care for the story structure, would've preferred it more if the daughter's instability had been presented as a surprise. The film seemed almost as if to try for that, but her appearance and behavior (hair color too dark, clothes and shoes too odd given her family's wealth, response to a spider crawling up her body) easily showed you something was very wrong with her. Acting was solid though. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1383782400,,1022,4.5
5670062,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"Many foreign filmmakers have made the move from their native country to America, and more often than not their style is either lost in the translation to Hollywood. As such, one of the best things I can say about Park Chan-wook's ""Stoker"" is that it *feels* like a Park Chan-wook film. This is perhaps to the film's detriment; the film played in a limited release and was only seen by a few people. Still, I have to commend Park for not sacrificing his art for the sake of commercial success. In the end, 'Stoker' is a film that can stand side by side with Park's other work and not feel out of place.

'Stoker' is effectively a dark coming of age story revolving around a young girl named India and her mysterious uncle Charlie who moves in with her mother after her father dies. The script, which is written by Prison Break's Wentworth Miller, has been cited as critics as being one of the weaker aspects of the film. In my opinion, while it's not as ""meaty"" as Park's other films it's still above  other films of its kind. There's a strong blend of dark humor and suspense and I was genuinely surprised by some of the twists and turns. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to what he comes up with next.

Mia Wasikowska and Matthew Goode both great performances as India and Charlie. Wasikowska is vulnerable, sympathetic while also downright creepy at times and Goode in particular oozes sinister charisma. Nicole Kidman is also effective but I feel that her character is underutilized aside from a brief monologue about parenting that she gives near the end.

Directing-wise, I think Park has done some of his best work in this film. His style here is almost operatic and dreamlike and many of the shots are breathtaking.

How's the disc itself? Well the picture is flawless as is the sound (as far as I can tell with my limited sound system). I wish I could say something more unique than 'it replicates the theatrical experience perfectly"" but there's not much else to say. From a visual standpoint at least this is the best Park Chan-wook has ever looked on Blu-ray.

Features-wise, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of a commentary from either Park (who usually does at least one) or Miller (who doesn't appear at all during the features but is only mentioned). Still, we get close to an hour of behind the scenes special features and what we have is pretty neat. There's a lot of discussion of Park as a filmmaker and the experience of working with him (he doesn't speak English and needed an interpreter on set). What stuck out to me was the level of input that Park had on the story itself; much of the film's symbolism and imagery came directly from him. Rounding it up are some deleted scenes and footage from the Korean premiere.

The film benefits from a strong script, great performances from its cast and Park Chan-wook's unique visual style. If you're a fan of Park's earlier output you won't be disappointed.

On a final note, I think it's interesting that so many people found 'Stoker' to be ""upsetting"" or ""disturbing"" given how tame it is compared to Park's Korean filmography. I guess in that regards this film works as a litmus test: if you can't handle this, stay far, far away from Oldboy.",1383696000,,3219,4.586086956521739

5670082,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"This movie is creepy, weird, awkward, and absolutely amazing. The director is best known for his equally weird and creepy ""Vengeance Trilogy"" which includes the movie Old Boy. Old Boy is sometimes referred to as the Korean Pulp Fiction for the role is plays in the director's career and in Korean art house cinema.

Stoker is definitely an art house film. I saw it in a theater with 6 other people. Ten minutes in I was hooked. The story centers on a daughter, India,  whose father has just died. At the funeral her mom introduces her to an uncle, Charlie,  she never knew she had. He has a fascination with India that is apparent from the start. She is immediately uneasy around him, but drawn to him all the same. So begins a story of the uncanny depravity that flows through the blood of the Stoker family.

The film's - I hesitate to use this word - 'gothic' sensibilities give it a great tension and atmosphere. This contrasts well with its almost Bretchian sensibility, which seems to invite each frame to be absorbed whole and each scene to be critiqued and enjoyed simultaneously. I watched most of this movie with a smirk on my face. There were scenes that I wanted to freeze frame and rewind, just to enjoy the obtuse meanings that were present. I felt like I was drowning and dying of thirst at the same time.

Add to this a strong script, non-cliche plot, beautiful cinematography, lighting, make-up, etc. and you have a great film.

This is my favorite movie of the still early year. In fact, it is probably the best movie I have seen in theaters since Inglourious Basterds. This movie has made me want to re-explore some of the other movies of Park Chan-wook.

5670084,2,B00BSN0VZ2,"**1/2

Directed by Park Chan-wook, ""Stoker"" is a Southern gothic tale replete with insanity, incest, murder, attempted rape and deep dark family secrets. India (Mia Wasikowska) is a troubled 18-year-old whose attractive, sports-car-driving uncle (Matthew Goode) moves in with her and her mother (Nicole Kidman) upon the death of her beloved father. And before you know it, people are hanging around in corners whispering confidentially, bodies are dropping like flies, mama and her deceased husband's kid brother are making googly eyes at one another , and India is beginning to develop some awfully inappropriate feelings for her dear not-so-old Uncle Charlie. On top of all that, India is learning that she may have some hitherto undiscovered paranormal ability that allows her to ""see what other people can`t see, hear what other people can`t hear.""

Though the movie establishes an effective mood and atmosphere throughout, the screenplay by Wentworth Miller is cryptic almost to the point of incoherence, as if the writers couldn't establish their coolness credentials and ""hipness"" bona fides if they didn't oversell their case. And oversell it they do, as the audience tries its damnedest to make some sort of sense out of what on earth is going on.  If you feel you can afford to take a precious hour-and-38 minutes out of your life to do so, by all means welcome to it. Otherwise, spare yourself the frustration and take a pass on ""Stoker.""",1379116800,2,1449,5.105485232067511

In comes together in unexpected ways, delivering a film that is stunning to look at yet underdeveloped and rather spotty to evaluate.  It feels like half a film, sometimes not even that much, and yet the film's clear assets are almost more than enough to make up for the faltering storyline.

I wasn't too keen on seeing the film, to be honest.  I had preconceived notions of what this film was going to be about based on the odd promotional campaign, and the critical reception didn't help convince me I was wrong.  It looked like a glossed over attempt at creating cheap thrills with a supernatural take on the Hitchcock thriller.  In some ways, it is some of those things and yet it isn't.  Despite being underdeveloped, nothing about this film is cheap.  The thrills are genuine mostly because they come with a sense of normalcy.  As the film develops and the true intentions are made clear, the crazy elements carry with them a feeling of natural calm, which helps create a real sense of tension and a haunting sustainability.

`Stoker' stays with you.

The basic premise follows the events that happen after the death of Richard Stoker.  At the funeral, Richard's daughter India notices a strange figure looming overhead, and soon she is introduced to him.  He is Charlie, her Uncle.  India's mother, Evelyn, was barely aware of Charlie herself, but is instantly smitten with him.  He is charming and almost immediately moves into their home and begins to insert himself into their lives.  Despite obvious warnings to his presence, Evelyn doesn't want to let him go.  Then people start disappearing.  India is dubious, but her sullen demeanor and hostile school life lead her to begin to embrace her darker side, which is aided by the help of her mysterious Uncle.

Lights flicker.

`Stoker', for me, feels very much like a Brian De Palma film.  It borrows a lot from other films, other directors and their signature styles, and melds them into one fluid movement.  Chan-wook Park single handedly saves Miller's fractured script by giving it a tremendous amount of electricity.  The basics of Miller's script are great and hold promise, but the skeletal handling of the characters and their backstories cause the film itself to feel underwhelming.  There is hinting towards things, instinctual things, that send charges of promise but they are never truly capitalized on.  Nicole Kidman is handed a thankless part, despite a killer scene or two, and Mia Wasikowska has a truly intriguing character to play and yet by the film's end we still feel as though we know nothing about her.

But then there is Matthew Goode.  He is brilliant here as the charmingly seductive Charles Stoker.  He looms over every scene with this great sense of presence and awareness, showing such depth perception in every tiny detail.  He's charming, chilling, sexy and confident, but the car scene with Dermot Mulroney is such a magnificent example of internalizing honest emotions and creating a fragility that is needed to sell his character as a whole.

With sensational production values (that cinematography is to die for) and a chilling atmosphere thanks to Park's attention to detail, `Stoker' rises above being a poor man's `Carrie' and becomes a respectable horror film complete with memorable moments (that shower scene should become infamous) and a sharp performance by a rising star.",1376524800,2,3493,4.993079584775087

5670120,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"Stoker is a creepy, though initially uninteresting, story of a family in the aftermath of a tragic death. It's actually quite a feat that director Park Chan-wook is able to achieve, with three individuals so shrouded in mystery but make us not really wonder what went down so long ago.

The movie is undeniably made well though. The score by Carter Burwell (of Black Swan) contributes to the atmosphere, as does the excellent sound design, heightening the cracks of an egg, the snip of scissors, and other disconcerning noises.

The flow also keeps the movie watchable, if not wholly engaging; it was easy to sit back and watch events unfold, but I wasn't really concerned one way or the other of how things went down - UNTIL a jolting revelation came about an hour into the movie. Suddenly the pace didn't seem quite so plodding when this element added an unsettling intensity to the story.
-consistently creepy atmosphere.

From there, though, the movie kind of fell apart; without providing spoilers, the end plot point just didn't fit with the logic of the rest of the story. There is no reason why things turned out the way they did. And maybe that was the point, that ____ happens without a clear-cut explanation; but for a hyper-stylized and well-thought out film, this ending just sputtered.

I don't mind films with disturbing content (re: my stellar review of Salo from a few months ago) if there's a point and message underlying it. With Stoker, I couldn't really pick up on it beyond for the narrative's sake... movies this dark should at least have a reason to be this way, and I don't think this did.",1375574400,2,1614,4.712765957446808

This movie appears to exist in order to be considered art. I have no art background so my review will hopefully be read with that in mind.

This movie appears to be rated very high for being artistic or very low for being contrived. From my view the movie had a unique visual style that definitely grabs you. Watching it I wanted to believe that everything was important and meaningful but in the end most of that was lost on me. I enjoyed all of it but I really wished I could have understood all of the intended symbolism.

The plot itself was very simple, but it was still fun to watch things unfold. The main characters are very bizarre and the acting is very good.

The movie is very sedate when it comes to violence but there is definitely a bizarre sexual energy thought the movie that keeps things interesting.

I gave this three stars because it felt like a lot of the movie was going over my head. With that said I am glad I watched it. I hope this review helps you based on what kind of viewer you are.",1375488000,4,1079,4.269607843137255
5670124,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"This brilliantly acted chiller deserves being viewed more than once. Some of its slow, slightly surreal symbolism is obvious. That spider crawling up India's leg - is she attracting it, or is it infecting her? In either case, it's easy to make the equation with evil. In the same way, the nature program that plays on the TV as backdrop to some of the most malevolent action, is about an eagle's slow, intent circling of its prey.

Other symbolic resonances are less obvious, their full significance likely to be caught only the second or third time through. Those sharpened pencils lined up in their case - the victims lying in their various improvised coffins. Then there's each year's gift of a new pair of schoolgirl shoes given to India - until her 18th birthday and the gift of a different kind of shoe.

I first thought the film was a little too consistently, self-consciously fraught with portent. But before long, I was hypnotized into it, transfixed by the gleaming, intense cobra eyes of the characters.

The main problem with the movie is it title. ""Stoker"" is the family name, the last name of the movie's protagonist. Perhaps some oblique symbolism can also be found in it. Was India's uncle stoking the flames of her waiting, predatory rapture? Perhaps. But that blank title might prevent the movie from finding its audience. That would be too bad.

Just as in ""Jane Eyre"", Wasikowska delivers an ethereal, otherworldly performance, and perhaps this has as much to do with her luminous beauty as with her skills as an actor. The story moves slowly, but this deliberate pacing is apt considering all that the viewer needs to take in in order to put the various pieces of the puzzle together before the shocking climax and the final scene.

Wasikowska plays India Stoker, a high school student who is mourning the recent death of her beloved father, Richard (Dermot Mulroney). India is distant from her mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), and is repulsed by physical touch. When her father's estranged brother, Charles (Matthew Goode) shows up, India's reaction to him is almost visceral. She is troubled by his sudden appearance and questions his motives, and is appalled at the intimate manner in which her mother behaves towards Charlie. It soon becomes apparent however that Charles's real interest lies in his niece, but what drives this interest? Is it mere sex, the anticipation of seduction, or is there much more to it?

The story has many layers to it, and what appears on the surface to be a Lolita-esque film turns out to be so much more darker and chilling. The discerning viewer will benefit from multiple viewings, as things that seemed disconnected turn out to be irrevocably woven together into one seamless story. Like an intricate spider's web, this story captivated me and held me in its thrall. Matthew Goode delivers a consummate performance as the debonair uncle whose eyes speak volumes when meeting India's wide, questioning eyes. He stalks India like a predator stalks a prey, but his motivations remain unclear until about halfway through the story, and when the big reveal comes, it is like a punch to the gut. Wasikowska's India metamorphoses from a virginal, quiet beauty into something entirely different, and this transformation is chilling to witness, especially when it becomes clear what she really is.

Creepy, beautiful, haunting, and chilling, Stoker is a cinematic gem that will appeal to those who favor a more cerebral type of horror film.",1374883200,4,2384,5.301587301587301

The acting is embarrasing and the structure is dizzying, I swear the film was flashbacking to scenes barely fifteen minutes earlier, repeatedly. Director Park seems like he 's trying to stradle a line between his own unique abilities as a filmmaker (Oldboy) and the filmmaker required to make a film with a Kidman/Wasikowska cast. The cast is just a portion of the blame. Nicole Kidman is on what sadly appears to be the inevitable decline regarding role choices as well as performances. Mia Wasikowska's previously hinted at stiffness/awkwardness are spotlighted here by the horrible situations the script and director have put her in. Matthew Goode handled his mostly non-verbal (like most of the script) in his usual B-Hugh Grant fashion and Dermot Mulroney punched the clock with a why-is-he-being-wasted-on-this-roll portrayal of brother introduced to rock role.

5670150,3,B00BSN0VZ2,"My guess is that while some may decipher what is going on in the new DVD release STOKER before the final moments of the film, most will not. And the honest truth is that this can be a good thing. It's rare that a film will offer you moments of sheer unease like this film does, but when it does so this effectively you'll end up with a movie that's unlike any other and quite original.

Mia Wasikowska plays India Stoker, a young woman whose father has just died in a tragic accident. Early on as the film opens to her voice over and scenes from her past, we know that India is nothing if not unusual. It's her birthday and every year she gets the same gift from her father, a new pair of shoes to replace her old ones. But what will happen now?

It's at the funeral that we get a better glimpse of the rest of the family. India's mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) is a wife who seems a bit off as well. While playing the distraught widow she seems as if she's walking through life not caring about much. The distance between mother and daughter comes up throughout the film. India was definitely daddy's daughter and mom was just someone who seems to think more about herself than India.

At the funeral India meets her uncle, Charlie (Matthew Goode). Charlie was rarely seen or heard of. In fact India wasn't quite aware that he existed at all. But her mother seems to take well to him and he ends up staying with them in their house to help out. All of this seems to point towards the usual relationship between the widow and the ""missing"" brother that we've seen in so many films. But those hints are never so certain here as more is going on than we realize.

The first odd thing that happens is when Mrs. McGarrick the housekeeper suddenly disappears. This was a woman who got along fine with India but who was last seen having words with Charlie. As viewers we assume what possibly happened but there is no proof, no scene that displays what happened or could have happened.

Then India's grandmother Gwendolyn (Jacki Weaver) shows. She has some reservations about Charlie but won't share them out loud. When she tries to discuss them with her daughter in law, Evelyn calls her out on the issue of Charlie's staying with Charlie in earshot. Gwendolyn has a fearful look in her eye when she glimpses Charlie and rather than spend the night in the house she heads for a motel. Her fate is one of the few we actually see happen. Or do we?

India continues to feel that something isn't quite right with her uncle Charlie. Nor is she happy with the way her mother seems to be fawning over him. Is it jealousy or is it a touch of caution she feels, a bit of intuition that makes her think that something just isn't quite right.

India also has problems not centered around home. In school she is tormented by the class bully for her unusual appearance and high IQ. Eventually a confrontation ensues between them where she is saved by another classmate. A love interest? Possibly. Then again there is more there than is seen on screen.

The movie is filled with twists and turns leading the viewer down one path and then veering off into another. Is Charlie really India's uncle or is he really a man whose only interest is her mother? Why does Charlie stare at India so intently? What really happened to the people that seem to disappear all around India? The answers to these question and more are answered before the end of the film and answered in such a way as to surprise even the most jaded viewer.

One thing you should know going in is that this film is not normal in any sense of the word. Characters seem like nothing you would find in real life yet they fit well in this story. Performances are not done in a standard method here but seem more like caricatures of characters instead. Speech and body language are done not as we would expect people to behave but instead to move the story forward. This may be in part because of the language difficulties found for director Chan-wook Park in his first time doing an English speaking film. Fans of this director won't be disappointed by what he offers here.

STOKER might not be the movie that most everyone will think of when looking through what is available on the racks or in the Redbox. But if you're willing to step out of your comfort zone, if you're willing to try something new, then this would be the movie to do that with. It also might be enough to get you interested in the other films of Chan-wook Park. While it's far from normal, it is interesting at all turns.",1374019200,4,4533,4.405017921146953

5670155,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"When people talk about a guilty pleasure, they are surely thinking of this movie. It's one of those movies that you really, really enjoy watching...while at the same time you feel as though you are wrong for enjoying it quite as much as you do.

After India's father dies, her uncle appears unexpectedly and takes up residence in the house. It quickly becomes apparent that his chief interest is India herself, though in the beginning, we're unsure exactly what his final motives are. He and India move through the movie like silent chess players, with one player countering the moves of the other. As the movie progresses we see the attraction between the two begin to build and intensify. Even as India tries to keep aloof, the pull she feels toward her uncle starts to break down her barriers.  It's obvious that Uncle Charlie is interested in being 'more than just friends' (if you catch my meaning), and even though you know that should gross you out, instead you find yourself falling for his allure right along with India and her mother.  Instead of feeling revulsion, you feel the same wickedly sensual awakening that is pulling at India.

Uncle Charlie is brilliantly played by Mathew Goode, who mixes just enough charm with his creepiness to keep the audience fascinated with him.  He smoothly inserts himself into the family dynamic and begins to seduce both mother and daughter.  He seduces the audience as well, and much like the mother (played by an almost invisible Kidman), we should know better than to fall for his ploys...but we can't quite help ourselves.

India is the real mystery in this story.  Even before Uncle Charlie's arrival, she is a dark, strange girl.  And the watcher is never quite sure if she is a damaged young girl being exploited after her father's death, or if she's been waiting her whole life for Uncle Charlie to show up and awaken what was already lurking in her soul.  Or maybe both.

Chan-wook plays with the tensions between India and her Uncle, both sexual and otherwise, like a musical crescendo, rising and falling away.  In fact, one of the more brilliant scenes in the movie is when Uncle Charlie and India are sitting at the piano playing a duet;  and the musical tension builds and builds, rushing toward the final chords,  when suddenly Uncle Charlie simply stops playing and India is left alone, pecking out the last few notes by herself, feeling very unfinished and unsatisfied.  Chan-wook does this through the whole movie, building the tension and attraction to unbearable heights, then letting it slip away, only to build it back up again.

By the way, nothing actually happens between uncle and niece, but that taboo foreshadowing of incest helps build the framework for the uncle's more sinister motive...awakening a fledgling killer who can be his partner in murder. Uncle Charlie sees India as the perfect soul mate to his quiet insanity. But does the real danger lie with the uncle or with India herself?

Beside the plot sucking you in, the choreography is also beautifully shot; and every scene and camera movement flows with the story into a wonderfully menacing waltz that demands you dance along with it.  Woo turns murder and psychopathy into art, and the watcher is left with the uncomfortable realization that they found it beautiful.",1373932800,6,3307,4.854092526690391

You couldn't figure if it was just typical teenage moodiness or something else more sinister. It was interesting that the psycopath gene seemed to be passed down from the uncle to the young girl. It really clicked for me that something was seriously wrong in the shower scene. She was so turned on thinking about her uncle killing the young boy who attacked her in the woods. Thats when it clicked that she was a psycopath just like her uncle. Something a little bit different to the normal run of the mill movie.,1373846400,5,675,4.451612903225806

It's not that it is badly written; it just seems to be more concerned with the visual strength of each scene and less interested in whether the story presented has credibility.

But the most interesting plot twist for me was the characters. I kept waiting to figure out who was the good guy, who did I want to ""win"" (if you could call it that).

The surprise talent was Mia W, who subtly evolved and changed, her facial expressions even while blank, said volumes.  And Goode, as the mystery character, was skilled at seeming pleasant and simultaneously sinister. He's so good looking, with his lean body and big vulnerable eyes. Some of the dots were left unconnected, but so what! It started just a bit slow, but that was just to enhance the build up.

Well, I would say that is kinda weird, what would the reason for that be?  Throughout the films running time you slowly get to see more and more of how creepy and crazy this Uncle character is.

I could see this film being made in the 1960's with the exact same script, and I think that's a great compliment because it definitely stands up to some of the moodiest thrillers of that time and it has that timeless feel.  The performances from all were great but Matthew Goode definitely stood out.  He was perfect as the charming, sexy as well as creepy and unnerving uncle.  I have to give props to Mia Wasikowska though, she does an amazing job with a role that has very few lines.  With a lesser actress, the role could have came off one dimensional but Mia did such a great job with her expressions that you feel you know India by the end of the film.  Clint Mansell did a beautiful job on the score as usual.  Overall, STOKER was a refreshing watch.  If you miss the thrillers of the 1950's and 60's, particularly those directed by Hitchcock or Polanski, there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy this film.",1373241600,8,1120,4.3768115942028984
5670178,2,B00BSN0VZ2,"Stylized nonsense with minimal content. The director tried hard to have this come together, with no avail. The characters were too shallow for what was trying to be conveyed.",1373241600,,174,5.0344827586206895
5670179,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"Psychotic people are dangerous.  I don't know about you, but no one ever told me that.  Still, it seems pretty important to know, don't you think?  That, and don't tell crazy people they're crazy.  Considering the fact that it's highly probable they have a wide range of personality disorders, they'll feel betrayed and most likely try to kill you.  Crazy isn't exactly a compliment, you know.  The 18 year-old India (Mia Wasikowska) learned the dangers of psychotic people in Park Chan-wook's (director of Oldboy) 2013 psychological thriller film, Stoker (written by Wentworth Miller under pseudonym Ted Foulke).  Now despite being one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen (not comparable to A Serbian Film or Visitor Q, more in the realm of Margaret or Cracks) it wasn't overly horrible, like some disturbing films are.  Despite being less than original, Matthew Goode surprisingly makes an eerily convincing pedophilic uncle, the cinematography was spellbinding, and it did have a few startling plot twists.

  Although Mia Wasikowska looks like an older and female version of the 2006 Omen's antichrist, Damien, Stoker is actually an incestuous twist off of Alfred Hitchcock's 1943 Shadow of a Doubt.  Shadow of a Doubt focuses on homicidal psychopathic Uncle Charlie who visits his older sister.  When his niece, also called Charlie, discovers his crimes, he devises various ways to murder her, always unsuccessfully.  Stoker also focuses on homicidal psychopathic Uncle Charlie who visits his late brother's family and develops a complex relationship with his niece, India.  Along with Shadow of a Doubt, Stoker contains Hitchcock's themes of the charming sociopath, the double, the perfect murder, suspense, trains, and mothers.  Stoker also contained standard Hitchcock themes of food and death, birds, tennis, audience as voyeur and sexuality.

  Even though Hitchcock is universally renowned for his film noir, I favored Stoker out of the two.  Matthew Goode steps out of his typical rom-com role to play India Stoker's lecherous Uncle Charlie with unnerving ease.  Nicole Kidman plays India's neglectful and self-absorbed mother, capturing her cold aura perfectly, to no surprise.  On the other hand, Mia Wasikowska portrayed outcast India with a unique blend of innocence and malice.  In spite of the outstanding acting, some plot devices were simply not credible.  The movie was shot with careful attention to the use of color, and several scenes were quite eye-catching.

  All in all, Stoker was a movie worth watching (I'm looking forward to seeing Miller's prequel, Uncle Charlie), one that kept you on the edge of your seat every minute, unlike Shadow of a Doubt.  It raises questions, at least for me, such as why does realistic horror scare us?  Are we afraid that what we've done will come back for revenge?",1373155200,4,2835,5.223946784922394

5670203,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"I'm pretty sure Alfred Hitchcock* would love this creepy film about the survivors of a family headed by Richard Stoker (Dermot Mulroney in flashback scenes) recently killed in a car crash.  His surviving wife, alcoholic Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) and their withdrawn teenage daughter India (Mia Wasikowska) are soon joined by a mysterious, and heretofore unknown, brother (Matthew Goode).  Brother Charlie's arrival is a shock to everyone including the family's long time housekeeper (Phyllis Somerville) and the brothers' aunt (Jacki Weaver).

Charlie's behavior is pleasant, proper and formal but at the same time, the way the guy focuses on people and things will give you the heebie jeebies.  He reminds me of Norman Bates.  Charlie is 9 years younger than his brother and no one has ever talked about him.  In a couple scenes, Charlie who sees himself as a pretty good cook, presents dinner to India and Evie but doesn't eat himself.  What is this guy, a vampire?  (I wonder if the title suggests a reference to Bram Stoker)

Korean director Chan-wook Park has a good handle on this film, given that the premise is a bit ridiculous.  It has some extreme sexual elements to it, but never goes too far...well except for Charlie's longing looks at his niece.  Charlie originally uses his considerable charms on Evie which is disturbing enough, but it is clear his primary focus is elsewhere and those who get in his way will have a price to pay.  Goode is very good in this role.

Equally noteworthy is Wasikowska who classmates call ""Stroker"" for no reason other than to torment her.  She stays within herself and is terribly suspicious of Charlie, yet fights an urge of attraction.  Her nature is perhaps hinted at early in the movie when a spider shows up on her leg.  The movie is great to look at with some beautiful sets.  Park has made a stylistic, if not perfect thriller.

*Check out Hitchcock's excellent ""Shadow of a Doubt""  for a similar themed film about another Uncle Charlie.  Also for Hitchcock fans, see if you can spot the McGuffin(s).

Another bonus is the excellent Blu ray transfer.  It has the usual 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The movie was originally shot using 35mm film and the transfer to Blu ray is flawless.  Wonderful clarity.  Check out the detail of the spider crawling on the floor and onto India's leg.  Great skin tones.  The audio component is likewise exemplary.  Using a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, there are numerous subtleties that eek out of the speakers.  A ticking metronome, insects, rain, hooting owls are highlighted.  There are a couple scenes where India and Charlie play the piano.  Excellent as is the whole film score.  Here is a list of extras:

Chan-Wook Park, South Korean director of cult classic 'Oldboy' and its companion films, made his English-language film debut with STOKER, a Hitchcockian suspense tale starring Mia Wasikowska as India Stoker, a teenaged girl dealing with the death of her father on her eighteenth birthday.  Never close to her mother Evelyn (Nichole Kidman) but adored by her father, India's world is turned further upside down by the arrival of her father's brother, Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), a handsome and charismatic guy, recently back from living abroad, who hasn't seen India since she was a baby.

Without giving anything away, it becomes very clear - very quickly - that something is not quite right about Uncle Charlie; that his calm, quiet, smiling exterior may hold something much, much darker.  And as India tries to peel away the layers of her uncle, what is revealed are things that repulse ... but also, bizarrely, fascinate.

To say more would be giving away too much, but I can say I loved the film; it's smart, intense, and beautifully written.  Mia Wasikowska proves she's one of the best actors of her generation working today, and Nicole Kidman does her usual excellent job, this time playing a broken bird of a woman who may be too far gone to be fixed.  But Matthew Goode, always a favorite of mine, shines here as the deceptively kind Uncle Charlie, and his scenes with Wasikowska particularly play like twisted works of art.

I guess I can see, a bit, why some reviewers call this an updating of Hitchcock's 'Shadow of a Doubt' (one of my all-time favorite of Hitchcock's films, and one EVERYONE should see); I read somewhere that the name of Uncle Charlie's character in this film was an homage to Joseph Cotten's ""Uncle Charlie"" in the Hitchcock classic, and God knows the film's tone and mood are very Hitchcockian.  But I think it's unfair to not let this film shine on its own; its a suspenseful, riveting, and oddly satisfying little thriller that might not be for everyone - but I think anyone watching it would be hard-pressed to say they weren't affected by it.",1371945600,5,2114,4.801652892561983

Korean auteur Park Chan Wook guides the viewer through an often visually impressive film but ultimately a hollow and pretentious film, emotionally void and disengaging.  Actor Wentworth Miller's manipulative script plants an obvious twist evident early on that falls flat by the reveal.
Nicole Kidman virtually whispers her lines to the point of incoherence, giving her weakest performance since the disastrous INVASION.  Matthew Goode as the disarming Charlie basically offers a one-note vision of the sociopath.  Mia Wasilowski (sp) barely rises above the Amanda Seyfried/Kristin Stewart school of emotional vapidness.

5670220,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"STOKER is a strange little film that unfurls its blossom of a story in manner that draws the viewer into the hauntingly bizarre family with fine writing (actor Wentworth Miller with Erin Cressida Wilson), fine directing (Chan-wook Park), fine art direction (Wing Lee) fine casting and some of the most beautiful cinematography of the year (Chung-hoon Chung). The magnetism of the film beings while the credits are being shown over the background of a beautifully wooded area where a girl is walking toward a roadside.  The voice over, that of the main character India Stoker, states `My ears hear what others cannot hear; small faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me. These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing, longing to be rescued, to be completed. Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow, I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone. I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse, and shoes which are from my uncle. This is me. Just as a flower does not choose its color, we are not responsible for what we have come to be. Only once you realize this do you become free, and to become adult is to become free.'

The plot can be summarized as follows without providing information that would destroy the suspenseful movement of this strange story: India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) was not prepared to lose her father and best friend Richard (Dermot Mulroney) in a tragic auto accident. The solitude of her woodsy family estate, the peace of her tranquil town, and the unspoken somberness of her home life are suddenly upended by not only this mysterious accident, but by the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evie (Nicole Kidman), India thinks the void left by her father's death is finally being filled by his closest bloodline. Soon after his arrival, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless young woman becomes increasingly infatuated with him. Yet it is on her 18th birthday that things dramatically change. There are plot twists that defy expectations in this movie whose elegant creativity is the biggest twist of all.

The musical score for the film is the work of Clint Mansell who repeatedly inserts excerpts from Verdi's opera `Il Trovatore' - the aria `Stride la Vampa' sung by the ominous gypsy Azucena (`Screeches the blaze! The restless mobruns to the firewith happy faces'). Every detail of this polished thriller has been expertly conceived.  The strong supporting cast includes Phyllis Somerville, Jacki Weaver, Lucas Till, Alden Ehrenreich and others. This is an example of expert film craftsmanship on the part of everyone concerned.

5670221,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"I was excited to see Stoker from the moment I saw the trailer for it, and in the end it did not disappoint me at all.  This won't be a movie for everyone--it is quiet and subtle and the tension within it builds very slowly.  It's not going to jump out and bash you in the face, which many movie-goers prefer in a Michael Bay world, so if you're looking for something a bit more obvious or in the realm of the fast-paced pulse-pounder, then you're going to want to skip this.  But if you appreciate something built on mood and tension, then Stoker should be a great match for you.

The film is beautifully shot--the visuals are amazing, and at many points it feels like you could randomly pause the image and have a beautiful work of art to frame.  The story itself runs closely to Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt in its premise, though it doesn't follow it exactly.  The actors that play the members of the Stoker family all do an excellent job of portraying characters that are ""off,"" though charismatic.  The movie does occasionally broadcast its direction a bit too soon, ruining a few of the ""twists"" within it, but the overall impression is a dark, twisted coming of age tale that disturbs and fits well into the Hicthcockian vein of suspense/horror.  I'm looking forward to more scripts from Wentworth Miller and more films from Park Chan-wook.",1371859200,9,1348,4.564315352697095

I would recommend this to fans of his work, it has his slick style, shots and editing are great, very cool to watch visually if you are a fan of his work.  I enjoyed the story, it's a well written mystery of murder and his unusually taste for love.  It has its slow moments and awkward acting, but overall I enjoyed it.  Rent if your a fan of Chan Wook Park, and his very strange visions of love, if you haven't seen many of Korean movies, you probably will find this to be a very odd movie.

Writer: Wentworth Miller.

Running Time: 99 minutes.

Rating: Rated R for Disturbing Violent and Sexual Content.

There are movies out there that almost feel like we should embrace a darker side to ourselves. Movies that cause whatever malicious feelings we have for our fellow man to come rising right up, as we smile with devilish glee over man's inhumanity to man. Usually, horror films do this, as we see their usually idiotic protagonists sent to their doom in the most horrible of ways. Or maybe something opposite, like with the character of Hannibal Lecter, who gets away with all of his killings with class and style.

In the event if you are wondering that Stoker is one of these films, I can safely say yes, Stoker is definitely that kind of film, namely the ladder. I can also say its easily one of the my personal favorites of this year, even with its slight issues, a film that is more than worthy of any time you may have to spend with it. Its many themes of childhood, growing up, maturity and family are so lovingly twisted around to the point that things we view as beauty turn to something we wish to distance ourselves as far as possible. It is very much the kind of film that likes to get under your skin.

India Stoker and her mother (Mia Wasikowska and Nicole Kidman, respectively) are mourning over the death of the father in the family, Richard Stoker (Dermot Mulroney). However, during their time grief, Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) comes right into the picture to help them out. He slips his way into the trust of the mother but India has untrustworthy feelings for Charlie. She knows he's up to something but something about Charlie's attitude starts rubbing off her and it all goes a in a surreal and icky direction from there.

I must admit I am a bit of a Park Chan Wook fanboy here. His 2003 film Oldboy is what I consider to be the best film I've ever seen, from its beautiful camera work, astonishing performances and incredible emotional depth. Wook's style of filmmaking is something that gets under your skin. The way he does sex and violence can bounce between being arousing and strangely enjoyable to grotesque and extremely difficult to watch. Stoker continues this trend but it somewhat plays with it. You don't feel as strongly about one as the other. It reaches an unusual balance of sorts. It also feels a little restrained in comparison to his other works. The film can get really uncomfortable when it wants to be, though, like a scene involving a shower and masturbation.

Usually, Mr. Wook has a hand in the screenplays he directs, but instead, the writing duties go to actor Wentworth Miller of Prison Break fame. The screenplay by him, caught wind in Hollywood in 2010 and became a part of the ""Hollywood Blacklist"", a list of the most popular unproduced screenplays. I could see how the script would click with Mr. Wook, however, as it chuck full of the things he likes to examine and his sick fun with.

A thing to note about Stoker is that is is a very symbolism heavy film, ala Darren Aronofsky or David Lynch. Lots of little things could mean something else entirely. A perfect example would be a spider that we see a lot in the film. Every time it shows up, it is always see crawling over India's legs, starting with the feet, then the legs, then the thigh, etc. One way I see is that it is a sign of Uncle Charlie's influence on India on much he's corrupting her. Or how India's shoes are put in prime focus, with multiple instances of seeing all of the shoes she's had over the years as she's become older.

Wook's visual style stands tall here as well, with many subdued colors bouncing between every frame. Characters in the film can end up having eerily normal outfits, almost giving off the feel that the air of civility that they sport could snap at any moment. The camera work is also equally excellent, namely a scene when India is on a roundabout and spinning while the camera is just in perfect sync with her movements.

On the performance side, the three leads are all equally good. Mia Wasikowska brings a very quiet and yet effecting performance as the detached India, as she tries to piece together what her life will go from here and Charlie's intetions. Nicole Kidman offers some good, if slightly minimal work here. She isn't, for my money at least, in the movie as much as I would like but she leaves an impression, especially a venomous rant she gives off near the end of film. Matthew Goode steals the show, however, as the very unnerving Uncle Charlie. Despite his soft-spoken tone and charm, Goode's performance oozes with the feeling of a man who kill you in a millisecond.  Every scene he appears in is enough to put you on edge.

Musically, the film is pretty wonderful in this department. The film was supposed to have heavyweight Phillip Glass (Koyaanisqatsi, The Truman Show, The Hours) but instead got the wonderfully experimental Clint Mansell (Requiem For A Dream, Moon, Black Swan). Nicely enough, we actually get to hear some of Glass's work in the film, in the form of a lovely duet piano duet between India and Charlie but Mansell, as always, provides a very nice score that fits incredibly well with the tone of the film. There's also a third artist, Emily Wells, who provides the end credits song, which offers a nice cap off to the film's end. It's a song that pretty well with the end of the picture.

The film does have its problems, but not with the script in any manner or direction. It mainly lies in how it was put together. I've read reports that film had twenty minutes cut out and while I still have massive enjoyment from what I watched, I wish we could have seen that longer cut. The main parts where the film has its pacing issues are, funnily enough, are at the beginning and end. The beginning is a bit jumpy with the flow of events while the end takes is certainly in no haste to deal with tension at hand.

There's also just the fact Stoker will not be a film for everyone. Around the time the film was being screened at the Sundance Film Festival, the response was almost universally positive. But when it came for the public response, it was much more mixed. Rotten Tomatoes currently has the film at an 67%, which is certainly positive but definitely shows off the fact that it isn't for everyone. The increasingly violent and sexual content, the uneasy feel of everything, the pacing and some of the actors performances will either be seen as wonderfully atmospheric or a bunch slow, pretentious drivel.

Is Stoker Park Chan Wook's new masterpiece? Hell no. Nothing will ever top Oldboy in my eyes, regardless of how good or who's in it. That was just the pinnacle of his career right there, but Stoker still serves as a nice addition to his body of work and even a good jumping off point if you want to see if you like his filmmaking style. Its performances, story, visuals and, just quite frankly, balls it has elevate it above most of what comes out in American markets these days.",1371686400,2,7181,4.602032838154808

5670225,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"I don't think I've ever seen a film quite like Stoker and given the dross in the theaters in the last year or two, it's refreshing to find something so original and daring. The three main leads are perfectly cast and carry the entire film between them. The brooding atmosphere established in the first 60 minutes or so is carefully designed to give you no idea how it will end - and the ending is definitely a surprise.

It's beautifully shot, carefully paced, and the horror is neatly set up in the clinical environment of this highly dysfunctional family's home. The plot cleverly plays with social taboos and there's a creepingly sinister aspect to all of the characters as we see them develop. As the revelations are delivered in the last act, there are some real surprises that would be simply unbelievable in the hands of a less talented writer or director.

Stoker shows how effective horror can be when it's done well. When compared with the utter garbage offered by films such as Sinister or Mama, Stoker shines and illustrates how CGI monsters are never going to be more disturbing than human behavior. This film died in the theaters (I'll admit from the name I thought it was a vampire flick before watching the trailer) but hopefully more people will get the opportunity to see this on DVD or streaming since it's easily one of the best films of the year.",1371686400,5,1367,4.644628099173554

5670230,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"Stoker is the type of film you don't see very often. It has a small cast with huge star power, a brilliant script, expertly crafted design in both set and costume, and a truly fascinating story. The film is told less through dialogue and more through action, facial expression, and the imagery of a scene. Stoker doesn't spoon-feed its audience. It expects them to be attentive and alert, ready to come to their own conclusions.

As a horror film it is strangely elegant. As a romance film it is quite disturbing. As a coming-of-age film, it is simply chilling!

Nicole Kidman, Matthew Goode, and Mia Wasikowska all provide some wonderful acting here. Kidman's talent is to be expected, but Goode and Wasikowska are especially impressive. Matthew Goode is nearly unrecognizable in his emotions on display here and Mia Wasikowska completely owns the role. Its hard to take your eyes off these characters.

The elegance of the set and costume design is surprising, giving the film an unusual style; the shifts in tone contrasted with the various designs often times creates a sense of disorientation yet overflows with beauty. The camera dances in expertly crafted movements, which is never a distraction, giving the film another layer of polish.

Music and sound design is expertly crafted as well. Classical piano and strings fill the score, while the sounds of the Stoker House are startlingly clear (due to a character's ability to hear extremely well). The sound of India cracking an egg, for example, will surprise many viewers. She is in-tune with the world around her, and the sound design helps create this illusion flawlessly.

This truly is one of the more interesting films of the past few years, one which cinephiles will eat up and more casual viewers should be intrigued by. Film: 4.5/5 STARS

The blu-ray's video quality is superb. Closeups are stunning and the cinematography is gorgeous, presented neatly in 1080pHD. Colors burst and black levels are excellent. Video: 4.5/5 STARS

Audio is a real highlight here. Like I said, Stoker sounds great. The music, the sound effects, its all captured well on the blu-ray. Dialogue is easy to hear as it moves around the sound-stage. Audio: 5/5 STARS

Extras include Deleted Scenes, Making Of videos, Photo galleries, and more. While most of the extra material is nice to watch, it doesn't spoon-feed the audience more answers and leaves the film's ambiguity intact. There isn't a commentary track. Extras: 3.5/5 STARS

Overall: 4.5/5 STARS. Stoker is a dark coming-of-age-horror-romance-mystery done very well and it has been given a wonderful blu-ray release.

Rating: R. A few scenes of disturbing violence, some shown, some implied, will disturb some viewers. Brief graphic sexual content in one scene is rather disturbing. Blood in a few scenes. Name-calling/vulgar insults might upset some viewers. Ages 17 and up.",1371513600,71,2879,5.080508474576271

Despite his charm, India feels an instant sense of unease around her uncle, but the darkness hiding beneath his perfect exterior slowly draws the two of them together. Park Chan-wook, the master of modern suspense, weaves this Stygian drama with all of the style and grace of the great Alfred Hitchcock, after whose films STOKER kindly takes homage. There is no SHADOW OF A DOUBT where its influence lies, but that is besides the point. Park is able to take the clinically-clean surroundings of high society and entrap them in a supremely sinister mood. STOKER plays on societal taboos from the very start, causing the audience to cringe during scenes of forbidden lust and desire. The constant sense of sexual tension is unyielding, and is broken only by the frequent bouts of black comedy. Park is a tactile director, and arouses each of the senses directly through the screen. Our heroine, India, steps right out of the pages of classic literature as she embarks on her journey in to womanhood, however unconventional the means may be. With a winning cast and strongly-driven suspense, STOKER holds a certain appeal to the mystery seekers and purveyors of more traditional Hitchcockian thrillers.

5670234,3,B00BSN0VZ2,"Whether you can enjoy ""Stoker,"" Chan-wook Park's first English-speaking film, depends on what you expect from this ""psychological"" potboiler (written by ""Prison Break"" star Wentworth Miller and Erin Cressida Wilson). While some of you may be impressed with the beautiful but often unsettling images and the eerie performance from the star Mia Wasikowska, others will scratch their heads, feeling that this ""coming-of-age"" thriller is ridiculous and pretentious.

Mia Wasikowska is India Stoker, a soon-to-be eighteen-year-old girl, whose father died in a bizarre accident. Then her ""uncle"" Charles Stoker (Matthew Goode) - ""Uncle Charlie,"" obvious reference to ""Shadow of a Doubt"" - arrives and starts to with India and her unstable mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). The presence of this mysterious ""uncle,"" about whom no one knows, triggers something deep inside India, who may have something in common with this visitor.

One thing I must say about ""Stoker."" I wasn't bored. The credit goes to the director whose penchant for describing humanity in a warped and twisted manner is still intact here. The cast also should be praised for creating creepy characters with some compelling (and somewhat over-the-top) acting.

At the same time, however, the secluded world of ""Stoker"" looks distant, as if recording some events that are happening on another planet. This is partly because Chan-wook Park is not interested in typical human behavior, but another reason is, I suspect, that the director is no Pedro Almod&oacute;var or Hitchcock, directors with better storytelling skills, who can fill seemingly unrealistic stories with thrills and insights.

Or maybe that distantness is the point. With striking visuals the director has created a world of his own, though what we get there is disappointingly not much.",1371254400,3,1810,5.430604982206406

It was a little slow and it was good, but there is also some borderline incest things going on that make it hard to watch. I will say that there is no actual incest scenes but there are some weird moments. The movie itself other then that isn't that bad but it is a movie you have to be in the mood for and be prepared for a few disturbing moments. This is also a movie where you aren't sure if there is a good person in this at all. The writing is very good and the acting is great but again you have to be in the mood for this. Overall, not a bad movie but there are some very uncomfortable moments in it. I give it a B-.",1371168000,5,1048,4.067632850241546

5670238,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"A young woman has just lost her father in an accident and her uncle, the father's brother, shows up at their home. He wants to be close to her, but she keeps him at a distance. His creepiness begins to grow on her, and the film takes a startling turn. This is a movie that you may be unsure where it is going, but once it gets there, it is quite eerie. This is a difficult film to review without revealing spoilers, so let's just say that if stick with this one, and see how it unfolds, it is well worth the time invested.",1370822400,2,522,4.028846153846154
5670239,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"I saw a review of this movie several months ago when it opened and kept looking for it to play at a theater near me. When it didn't last long in the movies, I thought it must be a dud. Boy was I surprised!

I really enjoyed this film. There are some parts that are a bit creepy in a weird way but if you pay attention, everything makes perfect sense. And there are some real surprises.

The basic premise is very easy to figure out and isn't hidden. There are two plot twists that are masked until the end. I loved the fact that the movie builds tension very well and is wonderfully stylish. Nicole Kidman is perfect as the mother raising a strange daughter, and it's clear early on that Kidman doesn't have all the lights on upstairs either! Then, just when you think you know what is going on with Uncle Charlie, actor Matthew Goode, something unexpectant happens and the connection between Charlie and India (the little girl) makes sense. The only thing I didn't understand (without giving away too much of the plot) is how Charlie knew that India was strange. He wrote that in his letters, but it was never explained why he would think they had a connection - unless his brother, India's father (actor Dermot Mulroney) - told him. So that part could have been explained a bit better.

But I have to admit that this movie kept me guessing and I liked it much more than I thought. I'm surprised the movie critics didn't like it more.",1370649600,3,1435,4.407547169811321
5670240,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"This by far is my favorite movie of 2013 so far!  From start to finish the acting, screenplay, directing, etc were classic from start to finish. Even the score/music was effective...Stoker is a must see and an instant classic!",1370563200,4,226,4.794871794871795
5670241,3,B00BSN0VZ2,"n Stoker the shots are arranged much like paintings, the sharp colours and the framed spaces, create a beautiful and surreal element to the film. The close-ups explore the human senses, and the momentary emotions felt by the characters. The camera is also used to detach the characters from each other, as it rotates between them and the dialogue.

The narrative could have been tighter, but this film presents an interesting theme of sexual awakening, violence, and the senses. The violence is short and abrupt, focussing on the act and immediate spectacle of death, rather than the grief and guilt.

Many of the shots and sets are reminiscent of Hitchcock. You cannot help but feel that Chan-wook was purposely trying to cram as many references in as possible. Not as violent as previous work, but an impressive psychological look into families and loyalty. Next time leave out Hitch...you do not need him...there are enough of us who remember The Vengeance Trilogy.

I wonder what my uncle is up to at the weekend......bowling maybe...

5670242,5,B00BSN0VZ2,"""Stoker"" is a beautiful, twisted, hypnotic trance - it's meant for an audience not overly concrete in it's thinking but who have an open imagination and are able to take the plunge into the darkly poetic vision of it's director. The three principle actors are superb but Mia Wasikowska really gives the film a beating heart, as she emerges from her innocense into her latent self.  This movie is filled with images that are as disturbing as they are lyrical and open to endless interpretation.  I've seen the movie three times in theaters and find that my impressions change with each viewing and that it has really haunted my imagination. ""Stoker"" is one of those unique and mysterious masterpieces that I'm sure I will be returning to frequently over the years - there's much to drink in, as the well runs deep,",1365033600,61,813,4.71830985915493
5670243,4,B00BSN0VZ2,"Stoker is a good film that takes bits and pieces from all over the film industry and puts them together into something enjoyable, if a little confusing.  Park Chan-wook, director of the original Oldboy, takes the reigns here, and his signature style is all over this movie:  meticulously long tracking shots; attention to detail; brutal and sometimes strange imagery.  He directs a screenplay written by Wentworth Miller (yea, the same guy who plays the lead character in Prison Break).  Apparently, this was on Hollywood's black list for some time, but finally got the green light.  And guess what?  It's pretty good.

Sure, both Park and Miller take cues from Alfred Hitchcock.  Admittedly so too, Miller has said that his jumping off point was Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt.  Park does use the deliberate camera shots, subtle references, the use of a likeable villain, and staircases, which are all obvious nods to Hitchcock's very influential directing style.  The violent imagery is somehow striking, adding to and enhancing the story without going overboard.

The actors are top notch here too.  Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland) takes the lead, and does a good job as a creepy, gothic looking young lady named India Stoker.  She plays the daughter of a couple who live in a large home and share a nice family life.  Her mother, Evelyn, played by the always enjoyable, Nicole Kidman, gets a phone call at the start of the film, indicating that her father has passed away.  At the funeral, they are introduced to the father's brother, Uncle Charlie, played by Matthew Goode (you'll remember him as Ozymandias from Watchmen).  He stays with them afterwards, as the viewers, and India, begin unraveling the mystery surrounding her strange uncle.  Goode portrays the uncle with a cleverly evil nativity, whose good looks somehow seduce both his sister-in-law and his niece.  His actions grow increasingly more violent and deliberate as the film moves forward.  The always somber look (and dark hair) of India does wonders to make you forget that Wasikowska played the golden haired and innocent Alice.  Nicole Kidman always seems to be in top form, and this movie is no exception, as her aloof and jealous behavior is both understandable and crazy at the same time.  Kidman plays the grief card with the best of them, and turns it on its head by the film's conclusion.

That isn't to say the film isn't without its shortcomings.  Some things are out of place, and hold little meaning, such as the CGI spider and an out of place subplot with the boys at India's school.  The movie doesn't really explain how India seems to ignore the fact of what she discovers about her uncle, until the very end.  Her actions at times also seem out of place themselves, such as her sexual awakening in the shower when thinking about a death she witnessed, or the terrifying behavior she displays in the film's closing minutes.  You could argue that her becoming more unhinged rises as she learns more about her unusual uncle, but even then, it doesn't hold with the film's attempt to explain her past relationship with her father as they hunted birds together.

In the end, the story holds up and is an enjoyable piece of film.  It has story disadvantages, but the strengths of the filmmaking and acting outweigh them.  I can't wait to see what comes next from Park Chan-wook, as he is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers.  Wentworth Miller, with a tiny bit of polishing, could become someone to watch out for in the screenwriting world.  Time will tell if this movie's cast and crew will get any nods from the Academy, and if it will hold up over time, but I for one, foresee holding the film in high esteem.",1364342400,8,3731,4.800940438871473
