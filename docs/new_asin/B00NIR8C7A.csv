6657392,4,B00NIR8C7A,"The setting, in an abandoned office tower, was appropriate if not completely eerie - but I believe that was the intended purpose. The content was great. Overall, however it comes off a bit one-note. It centers around one individual, and this individual talks for the entire film, with the exception of a few questions from the producer to direct the conversation. It could have done with the perspective of a few others or perhaps a bit more background on the financial collapse in German and it's impact on German banks.

Also, this documentary is in German with subtitles. So yes, you'll have to read while you watch a movie.",1426118400,2,627,4.752293577981652
6657393,5,B00NIR8C7A,"This is a sharp look at the banking industry and its role in our society. Nominally, it is simply an interview with Rainer Voss, a former banker in Frankfurt. Artistically, it uses the medium of film to offer a visually memorable and intellectually gripping study of investment banking. Voss is a compelling interviewee: intelligent of course, but thoughtful too. What he and the film director have to say is as captivating and thought-provoking as some more celebrated documentaries on similar themes. The closest comparisons might be to `Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room' and `The Fog of War'. Each film sets its own goals and direct comparisons are futile: I mention these other films only to suggest that `Master of the Universe' is in their league in terms of analysis as well as cinematography. Granted, some will find the film's pace languid and its language foreign (German, English subtitles). To those who need no sound-bites and are willing to linger when they think, it is highly recommended.",1421452800,14,1008,5.005952380952381

6657403,5,B00NIR8C7A,"This documentary does a good job of revealing some of the truths about the modern banking industry.  The film uses the interview approach, and this results in an excellent firsthand witness account of the internal workings of the banking industry, and of the dynamics of the subculture.  I already suspected a lot of the things presented here, but listening to a true witness speak with candor and sincerity helped me understand things more profoundly.  If you have seen the Goldman Sachs bankers lying to Congress live on C-SPAN, well this documentary is the exact opposite.  This film may be a little bit depressing, but it is Red Pill (i.e., factual and eye opening).  This film should be a wake-up call to anyone with assets to loose.  And in general, when asset values are destroyed, the social ecosystem is collateral damage.  So, a must watch for almost everyone.",1428796800,3,870,4.877551020408164
6657404,4,B00NIR8C7A,"l will keep my review focused on a few details (also available on IMDB) since there already are general reviews:

- First things first: This personal interview turned business documentary is lacking structure in my opinion. The movie has some rough cuts between topics, also because the questions are seldom audible. Maybe it would have been useful to add graphics and overlays in written or at least formulate the questions more clearly; this is especially annoying because a few questions can be barely heard off-camera. This should have been an either-or decision by the film makers.

- Watching the film without any economics or basic banking/trading knowledge could be hard at times. For example, there are formulas about swap products or the sums of bad loans issued/outstanding by large German banks (and their bad bank successors) written on the windows during the interview. Similarly, a number of open legal cases against Swiss banking giant UBS are cited by the interviewee (he is reading out of one of the latest UBS reports). Without further explanation, these topics seem cut together and could confuse the average viewer (same for oil bonds discussed by the interviewee or a Deutsche Bank ad for retail investors discussing long and short derivative products on the platinum price). Adding buzzwords without explanations or at least introductory statements make the interviewee gain an aura of superiority that is not warranted.

- The interviewed person sometimes comes across as biased against hedge funds versus established (big) banks, for example when discussing Greek bonds in distress. He focuses on the mess (hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that the Euro is supposed to be saved by politicians, acting as vultures) after it was said and done, not on the mechanisms and people who created the mess in the first place. There's a reason why hedge funds ""attack"" weak countries, they had large deficits and/or cooked their books to enter the Eurozone. It should be noted (at least in my opinion) that the latest crisis was largely caused by big banks and insurance companies with investment banking arms/units acting as hedge funds - the difference being that they were granted a public bailout while hedge funds acted on their own (no taxpayer bailout) this time.

The causes and roots of the latest financial crisis outside the realm of each bank (artificially low interest rates and the general role of central banks, subsidized housing promises in many countries by politicians, the removal of the Glass-Steagall act in the United States and other de-regulation in the financial industry etc.) are only touched upon briefly when the rise of globalized, more deregulated banking system is discussed in passing. In contrast, the problem of financial ""innovations"" sold to investors with mediocre knowledge of said products is well discussed with an example. This makes the discussion of the crisis somewhat anecdotal, only one problem area was discussed.

- Confronting the interviewee with another person, say a person from critical groups or NGOs such as Attac or Occupy! or even other investment bankers disagreeing in an open discourse could have helped the movie in my opinion. Without such interruptions, the former banker can present his theories and recollections, there are no dissenting voices - only brief TV adverts or news clips are mixed in, 95% of the movie time focuses on the interviewee answering questions in the empty skyscraper. We as viewers are forced to take his personal opinions as facts, which is sometimes hard to accept for viewers with some knowledge of the subject matter. On the other hand, people with no or basic knowledge of the subject matter will find it hard to follow.

In summary, I may have overly focused on negative points in my review.

This was not my intention since this movie gives a rare insight into the world of investment banking, these people rarely want to be in the spotlight and it probably took some convincing to find a suitable interviewee (who probably only agreed because he quit his latest job and is in voluntary retirement now).
For example, hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones is still buying up any circulating copies of the 1987 PBS film 'Trader' featuring him and his firm Tudor Investments because he apparently hates the movie.

It may take years before we get another detailed insight into a trader's or investment banker's mind through a documentary.

Even with all the flaws described above, I recommend this documentary for people interested in (investment) banking and the latest financial crisis as well as the ascent of globalized investment banking since around 1980.

In addition, I recommend the following movies as introductions on similar subjects:

- Inside Job (documentary, covers latest crisis)
- Margin Call (fiction, also covers latest crisis)
- Barbarians at the Gate (the 1993 classic, based on a true story)

PS: Speaking of other movies, I was more than once reminded of the 'Margin Call' setting when watching this movie. Both films take place in a eerily quiet skyscraper with artificially lit empty conference rooms and hallways; sort of a dehumanized setting with no natural sounds or other influences from the outside (real) world.",1428364800,,5258,5.108265424912689
6657405,5,B00NIR8C7A,"Excellent and scary.  For those of us still trying to understand what really happened here in the U.S.in 2008, this perspective from a German banker sheds additional light.  Anyone following the financial news even superficially, knows that the conditions leading up to the financial collapse of 2008 have not changed, and that it is happening all over again.  To hear this banker describe the impacts in Europe is compelling and frightening.  As he says, banks do not change and banks do not learn.  Nor do investors.  The revolving door between Wall Street and the White House has not changed and will not change.  The banker interviewed for this film is candid in his assessment of how things are unfolding in Europe:  One by one, starting with the smallest Euro nations, i.e., Greece, followed by Italy, Spain, Portugal, and finally France, these countries will collapse -- in fact, are very much in collapse already.  After France?  Game over, he predicts.",1428105600,4,961,4.987421383647798
