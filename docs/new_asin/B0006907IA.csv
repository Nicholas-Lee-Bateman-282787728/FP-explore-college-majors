8040489,4,B0006907IA,"Ernie Parsons (Marjoe Gortner) is a gun fighter who escapes the hangman's noose. He is able to impersonate a preacher in a small Arizona town with no blue laws. The town really needs a gun slinger to protect themselves from the evil Mr. Ross (David Huddleston) and his gang. Ernie is aided by Slim Pickens in an eye-patch while he has his eye on Bambi Award Winner Pamela Sue Martin.

This is a 1974 made for TV film with a fun simplistic plot without any twists. Marjoe Gortner has some pre-Hasselhof hair. Film has some humor. From IMBD:

Head of Posse: Ernie Parsons, having been found guilty by a jury of your peers...
Ernie Parsons: I didn't see any jury.
Head of Posse: Well, they was around. Anyway, what difference does it make. You gunned down Windy Jones and he was one of our most beloved and respected citizens.
Ernie Parsons: I heard he was the town drunk.
Head of Posse: Well, now that he's dead, he's one of our town's most beloved and respected citizens.

8040492,3,B0006907IA,"In a time period when Gunsmoke was in its swan song, this made for TV movie from Danny Thomas's company apart from Aaron Spelling was a sight for sore eyes. The former boy preacher, Marjoe Gortner, puts on a command performer paying homage to his former persona. Slim Pickens does justice as a black patch buddy from his old days. This film will not bore you for one instant as it moves along well from beginning to finish.",1335139200,3,423,4.435897435897436
8040493,4,B0006907IA,"Here is an early '70s made-for-TV western movie which features all the expected hallmarks of its sub-genre:  familiar actors, easy-to-digest plot, brevity, professional work by all involved.  THE GUN AND THE PULPIT has got 'em all and then some.  What more do you want?

Marjoe Gortner, who I only knew previously from FOOD OF THE GODS, is your main attraction here, portraying a gunslinger on the run who masquerades as a visiting small-town preacher.  But wouldn't you know it, he winds up getting entangled in all the townsfolk's' affairs.  Gortner is a delight -- ALL charisma -- playing a quick shot that is equally quick-lipped.  Never boastful or cocky, Gortner strides through the film confidently, really making you root for his character.  I was not surprised to learn that the actor had been a preacher in real life -- his personal magnetism is truly a thing to behold.

The supporting cast includes familiar faces such as Pamela Sue Martin, Estelle (""Voice of Mrs. Claus"") Parsons, and David Huddleston.  Also featured are two excellent supporting performances:  Geoffrey Lewis and Slim Pickens.  Lewis, whose name you may not recognize, but whose face you most definitely will, is terrific in a very brief role as one of Gortner's rival shooters.  He plays the hired gun like a seasoned business traveler, right down to work with no pretense of romanticism.  His big, dramatic shootout scene is the film's best gag, hands down.  As for Pickens, the veteran makes a kind of throwaway sidekick role into one with a touch of grace -- witness the scene where he deftly reveals his knowledge of Gortner's past.

Because this is a 75-minute TV movie, certain plot points are not very fleshed out (Gortner's romance with Martin; how exactly Huddleston lords over the townspeople), but that's to be expected, and it really doesn't detract from the overall story.  And it is a pretty lightweight affair.  There are more than a few scenes played for laughs, and even the grim day-to-day life of the miserable locals is considerably downplayed.  You can usually tell by a movie's score how the filmmakers themselves view the goings-on, and here the themes are rousting, stirring, lighthearted, not a bleak passage to be found.  The opening and closing title music is particularly catchy.  Credit to George Tipton for nice work there.

I found this flick to be a great, entertaining western featuring a winning lead performance.  I recommend it if only to check out Mr. Gortner.  8/10 stars.",1279497600,2,2492,4.963768115942029
