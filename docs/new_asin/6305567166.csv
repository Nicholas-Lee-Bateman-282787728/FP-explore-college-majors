BECAUSE PAULINA RUBIO COMES OUT IN IT. IT A VERY GOOD STORY ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH, AND YOU NEED TO APPREACIATE YOUR LIFE MORE. IT IS A ROMANTIC COMEDY. PAULINA RUBIO IS THE BEST SINGER,

SHE IS SO PRETTY. AND TALENTED, THE VERY BEST. I RECOMEND THIS MOVIE AND ALL HER CD'S. I HAVE THEM ALL, AND I JUST CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THEM.",1134950400,,367,4.154929577464789
