Touching and hilarious all at once,  full of quirky characters and brilliant performances by Holly Hunter, Tim Robbins, Alfre Woodard, Mary Steenburgen, and Scott Glenn.

382235,5,6301929810,"Personally, I enjoyed this movie about an off-beat woman who decides compete in the Miss Firecracker contest.
She wants to go from being Miss Hot Tamale to Miss Firecracker. Who could blame her?
It's the story of a real underdog told with a mix of pathos and humor.
All of the acting with superb!
It leaves you with a sense of inspiration to stand up and triumph!
Plus, I got the movie arrived in good time and shape!",1439251200,,417,4.358974358974359

382241,5,6301929810,"I have always considered this movie a companion to Raising Arizona. It's the quirky, story of a small town former, 'Miss Hot Tamale', Carnelle, (Holly Hunter). Carnelle dreams of leaving Yazoo City in a 'blaze of glory' as Miss Firecracker, a pageant held on the 4th of July. Alfre Woodard, Tim Robbins, Mary Steenburgen, are part of a supporting cast of characters that you will love. If you are expecting stomach clutching belly laughs, this may not be for you,but it you want a movie that has a heroine you want to root for, and an (at times funny) interesting look at small town life, then I highly recommend, Miss Firecracker.",1399507200,,631,4.693693693693693

Each character will surprise you & how their actions affect each other's world.  You grow to love both the deeply wounded & the innocent.

In todays competative/bullying/making fun of peoples live styles, those same attitudes were found reflected in this movie.
Just did not enjoy it.
Was hoping to just sit back and enjoy the movie and have time to close out the ""real"" world and this movie just reminded me more of it.",1362787200,,421,4.552631578947368
382260,1,6301929810,"This movie was recommended by a critic in the SF Chronicle a few weeks ago and I looked it up on Amazon, and everyone thought it was great.  I have no clue what anyone saw in this movie, it's one of the worst stories I have seen in my life!  It is totally pathetic!  I hung on as long as I could (about one hour), but I finally said ""forget it!"", it's not worth my time!!

I didn't give this a bad rating because the movie itself is great.  Depending on what you're used to, you might be disappointed in the video quality.",1326153600,,266,4.617021276595745

382263,5,6301929810,"This movie has been one of my favorites for years.  But then, I like all of Beth Henley's work.  It is over the top, funny and outrageous, even ridiculous at times.  But there was also real humanity and connections that I found moving.  I believe I remember hearing Holly Hunter say that she played the character much as she did when performing it on Broadway; and when she saw the film, she found her performance grotesque.  I don't agree.  She's extreme and a bit over the top, but I thought her performance was charming and appropriately desperate at times.  And I could watch it again and again.  Actually, I have.",1257552000,2,618,4.554545454545455
382264,5,6301929810,"This is one of those films that I view every now and then when I need a good laugh.  Holly Hunter is superb as Carnelle Scott, the wannabe beauty queen.  Although we laugh at the characters, Beth Henley's writing is never mean spirited to the characters.  It is a virtuoso ensemble cast.  There are some real gems in here, the scene where ""Popeye"" (Alfre Woodward) explains how her eyes started popping out, and Delmont and his former Miss Firecracker sister (Tim Robbins and Mary Steenburgen) tango through the house.  The Miss Firecracker talent contest is brilliant...........this film deserves attention.",1217289600,8,608,5.101010101010101
382275,5,6301929810,"And not a bad introduction to astronomy.  I guess the only complaint is the whole production seems too stagey, as if the performers never completely made the transition from acting for stage to screen.  While other beauty pageant send-ups that followed in the next decade, like ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" and ""The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom,"" left me hurting and frowning, ""Miss Firecracker"" provided a much needed sympathetic counterbalance.

Carnelle (Hunter)is trying to win a beauty contest for the fourth of July like her cousin Elain (Steenburgen). My favorite part is the IR romance between Tim Robbins and Alfre Woodard.

382277,5,6301929810,"a movie of which I'd never heard, though I considered Holly Hunter hot in ""Broadcast News"".

Then this was recommended to me.  A small movie and a sleeper that is a must see.  Steenbergen is excellent [...].  Holly is the orphan-turned-town-pump-turned-determinedly-upwardly-mobile in the big small way offered by a small town.

All are excellent, but it is Alfre Woodard who walks -- ambles? -- away with the film.  Hilarious and profoundly serious at the same time.  And of a lovely light romantic idealism lighter than the lightened Carnelle in the scene at the end when she finally climbs above the ground.

Sweet and lovely film.  You'll love it.  If you don't, then you didn't watch it.

Popcorn-suitable, for those who prefer that kind of film.",1210809600,6,751,4.928

382279,3,6301929810,"This is in fact an art film, featuring splendid acting and a plot that is barely coherent.  Two major characters in the story, and several scenes, don't seem to belong at all.  Three cheers for Mary Steenburgen and Holly Hunter.  The problem seems to fall on the director, whose choppy and confusing style may leave many wondering why they bothered to spend the time with this movie.",1163894400,6,383,4.686567164179104

I don't know why I even ever watched the movie on the first place, I guess  just 'cause my mom bought it at a yard sale a few years ago and we had it to watch. Well, it's become one of my favorite movies of all time.  The only bad thing is that it's hard for me to  see Holly Hunter as anything else but Carnell Scott or Alfre Woodard as anything but Popeye in any other roles.  If you like it, the DVD is a must have.  I wish it had more features like commentaries by the director/cast.  But it's better than nothing.",1092441600,13,538,3.925925925925926
382282,5,6301929810,"Contemporary playwright, Beth Henley's (""Crimes Of The Heart"") ""The Miss Firecracker Contest"" is brought to life and to the big screen.
The film features an incredible Holly Hunter as the tramp of the town turned wanna-be good girl beauty queen Carnelle Scott.  Carnelle was an abandoned little girl who was dropped off at her aunt's house in Yazoo City not more than a year old with ringworm, diaper rash and a bag of dirty rags.
Deeply intense, Tim Robbins as cousin Delmount Williams (recently out of a mental ward) and the beautiful Mary Steenburgen as Elain Rutledge (a forever young beauty queen) grew up with young Carnelle in their household and under their mother's care and Carnelle is more like a sister to them than a cousin.
After Carnelle works on her talent routine for FIVE years and then dyes her hair a bright red, she gets up enough gumption to  enter the Yazoo City Miss Firecracker Contest!
Enter Alfre Woodard as Popeye, the local seamstress that learned her trade at the tender age of four - sewing costumes and clothes for the Yazoo City's neighborhood bullfrogs!  Carnelle hires Popeye to help her with her costumes for the beauty pageant.  All Popeye wants to do is move to Elysian Fields (a funny and touching scene inthe movie) to forget about her troubles and eat ambrosia all the live long day.
A week before the pageant, the carnival shows up in town with all it's pretty lights and fun rides. Scott Glenn as the carnie, Mac Sam has a romantic history with Carnelle and is certainly dying of lung and kidney failure when he shows up in Yazoo City in the year 1988.  This year will be his last for a Firecracker Celebration.
It seems Carnelle has a reputation around town and that she slept with any guy that crossed her path just so they would tell her that she was beautiful back in her younger years. EVEN a YOUNG Mr. Richard Fish from Ally McBeal (Greg Germann) makes an appearance as one of Carnelle's old lovers and is a total hick of  a peanut throwin', hootin' and hollarin' idiot, by the name of Ronnie Wayne. Ann Wedgewood as emcee, Miss Blue and Amy Wright (Rose Leary from The Accidental Tourist) as hunch-backed beauty contestant Missy Mahoney also have small but great parts!
If only Carnelle wins the Miss Firecracker Contest, she will finally feel the acceptance and satisfaction she has longed for all her life.  Is it Carnelle's chance to shine? What happens between Popeye and Delmount?  Does Elain leave her husband?
Turn on, tune in and watch to see what happens!
This movie isn't a chick flick by any means. It's really a TRAGECOMEDY with happy, funny, sad, and downright depressing moments that make you think...Hmmmmmm.
Happy Watching!",1089244800,30,2689,4.718550106609808
