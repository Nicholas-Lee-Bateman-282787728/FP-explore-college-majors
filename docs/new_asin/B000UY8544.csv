Aside from that, I am sure I bought a NEW product, but for some reason when I played the DVD it skipped on the letter 'O' and gets scrambled up?!? This lasts for a few minutes and goes back to playing. But when you buy something NEW you don't expect flaws like that. My son always thinks the 'battery is going dead' when it happens...I didn't notice any scratches on it when I first opened it. Anyway...just thought I'd vent about the quality of this particular item I ordered awhile back. Thanks!",1407456000,,559,4.490196078431373
