7912401,5,B00000JL3Q,"In episodes 13-15, the Jackal saga ends, pitting Kenshiro against an insanely large adversary known as ""Devil Reverse"". Religious overtones, yes, but to change the name would just be lying. In the next two filler episodes, Ken has to fight a fat ex-policeman with an Australian accent (in the dubbed version, at least), and a necromancer with a toupee. These episodes are a bit more whacked out than the norm, but people that enjoy Fist of the North Star for its absurdity won't be disappointed. Those waiting for the fight with Kenshiro and Shin won't be seeing it in these episodes yet.. but regardless, all anime fans should buy this, but subtitled. Almost all of the drama is destroyed in the dubbed version.",993340800,,712,4.796747967479675
