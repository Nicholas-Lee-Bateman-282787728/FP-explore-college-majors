8333826,5,B001PMR2TY,"Lets say your child hear's one solo that blows his mind. He'll/she want a guitar, an practice amp, a muliteffects board, and edu. guitar grimoire and this video will be all he needs.  Gives good theory analysis of seeing overlaying of modes over each other ( lets say you have a c dorian on 5th string , and g mixolydian on the 4th string; same notes ; you can change on the fly during your solos. one example)  very useful practicing tools for melodic and efficient movement around the fretboard. One thing I will say I dislike is he plays a seven string guitar as a professional tool and should be teaching off that on all strings.  He teaches it as a 6 string ( honestly theres no reason to produce such guitars) .  Get this vid and you won't need the first one.",1388707200,,765,4.291666666666667
8333827,2,B001PMR2TY,"Bought other fretboard mastery video and started to view them than this one after getting it. The instructor has a tendency to always show his fast shredding prowess to impress, I suppose. However, I don't find his skills impressive as the sound he produces is of low musical quality. He demonstrates different exercises on a 7-string guitar for you to master the 6-string. Oh, brother! His tuning is half step lower. Oh, boy!

There are better video products out there.",1367280000,5,470,4.875
8333828,5,B001PMR2TY,"This is level two in the two part series, although rustys website says hes doing an arpeggio series for rockhouse as well so maybe not just a two part series! this videos only drawback is it literally has much of the same content as level one. i understand that they wanted it to be a stand alone dvd but including half the content of level one seems a bit much. But alas there is enough new content to still make the video a must have. it continues where level one left off (after going through half of level one again) the extras inlude the music video for rustys band OUTWORLD (currently not together anymore) and includes the same ""interview"" as level one, again a little dissapointing. In the end though the video is well worth the cost, the content and prodution quality are top notch. if your a serious guitarist....GET THIS NOW! ahem.....get level one first though.",1246147200,,873,4.56687898089172
