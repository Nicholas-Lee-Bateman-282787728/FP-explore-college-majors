8667911,5,B00LTFE9UC,"Bought this Blu Ray for Tango and Cash. The specialist is a bonus. Tango and Cash is one of my favorite movies of all time. I had it on DVD however, I wanted to watch it in better quality since I am a fan. The price for this was good and it is blu ray quality. Would recommend. If you haven't seen Tango & Cash buy this now and you won't regret it.",1477526400,2,348,3.780821917808219
