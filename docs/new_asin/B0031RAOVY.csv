4049456,4,B0031RAOVY,"""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" is directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules), and is based loosely on the real life story of a dog, named Hachiko, who was born in Odate, Japan in 1923. His master, Dr. Eisaburg Ueno, was a professor at the University of Tokyo who died in 1925. Hachiko returned to the Shibuya train station the next day, and every day for the next nine years until he died in 1934. Today, outside the Shibuya train station, where Hachiko waited, is a bronze statue of Hachiko.

In this particular movie we have a similar story, only the dog is in transport to the United States, where he escapes, and ends up in Parker Wilson's (Richard Gere) possession. Parker eventually decides to keep the dog since the owner cannot be found. Hachiko, or Hachi, as he is usually called here, at one point breaks free of his yard, and follows Parker to the train station. Eventually Hachi is allowed to accompany Paker to the train station everyday. But at one point Parker never returns to the train station, since he has died at the university.

The movie then becomes a tale of a loyalty that reaches far into the bonds of memory. Hachiko never realizes that his master has died, and even though he never sees his master again, he never forgets him. What is Hachi's purpose now that his master has died? His purpose seems to be to wait for his master who will never return. It is at once moving and heartrending, as it is a tragedy of sorts, and one that is only resolved once Hachiko also dies. This is a beautifully told tale that makes one think about the things that are important for us to go on living, even after those that we have loved have died.",1259452800,159,1662,4.445901639344262
4049457,4,B0031RAOVY,"This is a story everyone in Japan knows. Based on the true story of a dog called ""Chuken-Hachiko (meaning ""A loyal dog Hachiko"") that lived in Shibuya, Tokyo, ""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" is a moving tale about friendship and loyalty between a man and a dog.

In ""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" Richard Gere plays Parker Wilson, a college professor teaching music. One evening Parker finds a lost puppy at the station of fictional east coast town Bedridge, where he lives with his wife Cate (Joan Allen) and daughter Andy (Sarah Roemer). (The film was actually shot in Rhode Island.) No one at the station knows why the puppy is there, so the professor takes the dog home and keeps him. The puppy's name is Hachi, which means ""eight"" in Japanese.

Hachi grows up and it becomes his custom to wait for the professor at the station every day at 5 pm. Hachi becomes a fixture of the station and a favorite of the commuters. When they think their happy times last forever, however, something happens, and Hachi has to wait Parker much longer than he used to do.

Richard Gere (who also co-produced the film) turns in a solid performance as usual, as a family man who reluctantly takes care of a lost puppy, but the real star of the film is, not surprising, Hachi himself as the faithful dog. Among the supports, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Parker's friend, Jason Alexander as the station master and Erick Avari as a hot dog vendor are memorable, but unfortunately female supports including Joan Allen, Sarah Roemer and Davenia McFadden are a bit wasted in this comparatively short film.

""Hachiko: A Dog's Tale"" is an American remake of ""Hachiko monogatari"" (1987) directed by Seijir Kyama. The Japanese film's story is inspired by the true story of an Akita dog Hachiko (1923-35) and the professor of Tokyo Imperial University (today's The University of Tokyo) Hidesabur' Ueno (1871-1925). Those who have visited Tokyo may remember the bronze stature of the dog at JR Shibuya station where Hachi was once seen.

Helmed by the director Lasse Hallstrm (""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" ""My Life as a Dog""), the film is a good example of a simple story well told. It is not a big story, but its emotional power is undeniable.",1251936000,53,2199,4.731070496083551
4049458,5,B0031RAOVY,"From Tokyo, where the film has just opened: In Japan, most people know about Hachiko, especially in Tokyo; his statue is a popular meeting place in the Shibuya shopping area. The true story of Hachiko is just as well known here in Japan. In this review, I assume that you know the basic story outline. Still, if you wish to avoid what you may consider a spoiler concerning a turning point in the story, then avoid reading after this paragraph, as I discuss a central plot point--but not one which really gives too much away, any more than it spoils the movie ""Titanic"" to know that at some point, they hit an iceberg. Still, I wanted to warn you just in case--someone who never heard of the Titanic before might enjoy the whole iceberg twist.

The story: a faithful dog comes to meet his master at the train station every evening when he returns home, and when the master, a college professor, dies at his school and does not return, Hachiko continues to come and wait at the station every day for nine years to wait for his master's return. The very thought of such a loyal, sweet animal being so, well, doggedly committed to finding his master is bound to bring tears to most people's eyes--and it didn't fail here, with there being a considerable amount of sniffling and eye-dabbing in the theater. ""Not a dry eye in the house"" comes to mind. If you like schmaltzy tearjerkers and cute fuzzy dogs, then this is your kind of movie.

The basic story remains the same as the actual one, but builds up a new human dram around the dog story--which succeeds in not detracting from the central story at the same time. You never stray far from the dog, it's clear that Hachi is the protagonist and at most we spend three minutes away from him at any one time. Nevertheless, the characters are fairly well developed for what they are--supporting roles. Joan Allen does a good job as the wife reluctant to allow another dog in the family after the last one left them. Jason Alexander has a bit of fun as the self-centered station manager, and recognizable character actor Erick Avari does an excellent job as a hot dog and coffee vendor outside the station. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa did surprisingly well as the Japanese expert at the college. But the dog is the star, and does a good job of keeping our attention.

I contrast this with a movie from last year in Japan, ""The Tale of Mari & 3 Puppies,"" about a Shiba Inu dog owned by a family when a large earthquake hits the region. The movie, billed primarily as a dog movie, mostly focused on the family and featured more than a little over-acting from the supporting cast, and failed to show us the cute doggies so much. In ""Hachi,"" it's the reverse--you get lots of dog time, but also a nicely-rounded drama with good acting all around.

A few things were overdone, but not to bad effect. At the movie's outset, we see Hachi as having been sent, unattended in a bamboo cage, all the way from Japan--not just Japan, but from a Buddhist temple in Japan--only to be lost on the last leg of his journey when he falls off of a handcart at Gere's train station. That (a) the person pulling the cart could be so careless and (b) that whatever local person paid so much money to have the dog shipped and then never inquire as to what happened to him, well, is kind of pushing it. It feels as if Gere wanted to put in a nice Buddhist reference and have Hachiko's tale be a bit more dramatic. You kind of roll your eyes at all this, but it doesn't get in the way of the story. None of the overdone bits go so far as to really distract from the story, and they do work well at the emotional level. In the end, what you have is a fun little drama about an adorable, faithful dog with a tearful ending; the movie does very well being what it is supposed to be.

A bit of background: the story of Hachiko is not completely without controversy. There are some who claim that the story was deliberately popularized in fascist pre-war Japan as a means of inculcating loyalty to the emperor and to the state--the idea being that Hachiko's utter faithfulness up to the bitter end was a model that the government wanted the people to follow in supporting the state. Of course, Gere's film does not come close to this; there is even a specific reference to loyalty as pertaining to those one loves. Other detractors of the story contend that Hachiko was not being faithful to his owner, but had simply become addicted to the treats given to him by shops and vendors near the station (interestingly also included in the new film).

A small note: Hachiko, both in reality and in most of the film, was an Akita, but in this movie, Hachiko the puppy was played by a Shiba Inu, a smaller, related breed whose main difference is in their size and temperament. Despite being regarded as a ""goof"" in the IMDB database, this was an intentional choice by the film's producers, who decided that a Shiba puppy would be easier to handle, easier to train for what was needed--so says a book released in Japan concerning the film.",1249948800,273,5037,4.457700650759219

I especially liked how well the Akita was showcased. Very loyal, loving and difficult dogs to force affection. A very independent and almost catty breed. For those who saw cruelty in what they interpreted as abandonment , I must say I saw the exact opposite. No human enforced his will upon that dog. That dog was allowed to honor his master in the only way he could. By waiting every day for the rest of his life. A 10 hanky movie.",1525305600,,561,4.554455445544554

4049536,3,B0031RAOVY,"The acting in this film was very unconvincing. Disappointed in Richard Gere. We didn't FEEL like he had a real connection with the dog (but then we're dog lovers and know what that looks like). Same with other actors in the movie - shallow and hollow. If this dog was so bonded to his owner for only 2 years then it seems like Richard's acting and the scenes would have substantiated that better. (Perhaps in real life, but not in this movie.) Seems like it was thrown together and made low grade.

The dog on the other hand was definitely cute and what the only thing that carried the show as well as the actual story in our opinion.

The only good thing about this story is the story itself. It is a touching story, but left out a lot of details, like how can a dog keep returning to the same place at the same time for 9 years? Also, who fed the dog? It was implied that some of the local vendors in the area did, but for 9 years (the guy at the portable hot dog stand?)? What about where the dog slept all that time? Outside? Did it ever need medical care? It seemed like nobody really tended to the dog. Did it stay friendly all that time? How long did the dog wait at the train station before it realized its owner wasn't coming each day?  I don't know... just seems some other details would have been nice.

The other thing we wondered is if this actual true story took place in Japan, why didn't they have Japanese actors to bring to life the real story closer to the way it happened - at least the owner of the dog... like a lot of other movie makers do?

I just read Cynthia Brokenshire's review and she answers a lot of questions that were provided in the Japanese version of the movie. (Thanks!)",1520380800,2,1707,4.207951070336391

4049557,1,B0031RAOVY,"I was really skeptical watching this because I'm quite familiar with the story of Hachi and the Nihon Ken breeds of Japan and yet.... the cast was obviously not Japanese. I still wanted to go in with an open mind. The way the director went about telling the story of Hachi really butchered the tale and took the focus away from the bond between dog and man, and rather used family drama to make it interesting. Needless to say, I am really disappointed. I love a good dog movie, and I wanted to be sad, but I finished this film feeling angry that someone really went about telling such a beautiful legend this way. This is a white-washed failure. The film would have been so much more beautiful and meaningful with the inclusion of the culture in which it originated.",1517961600,2,767,4.485714285714286

4049565,1,B0031RAOVY,A man and a dog have a special bond. Man dies first. Dog continues to go to train station to meet him for a decade. No one tries to establish their own bond with the dog. The dog dies still waiting for his deceased owner to show up where he used to. That's five sentences I wish I was aware of before wasting my time. Why turn those five sentences into a movie? Pointless. Waste of time. I didn't cry. Just looked at the tv in shock that most people love this movie. This is one of two movies that is clean but horrible. Rated G is the only good thing about this movie other than the beginning that lures you in to set you up to be frustrated at everybody involved in making this. I have a dear friend who recommended it. I love her. I just don't understand how she had anything positive to say about it. It's the type of movie you don't even want to take to a used DVD store because you don't want to contribute to someone else having to see it for the first time.,1515110400,,965,4.03125

In real life, stray dogs get parasites, they get hit by cars, and they get into fights with other dogs. They live on garbage and get emaciated. They can develop behavior problems that make it hard for them to live with a family. Some of them end up in dog fighting rings.

I hope the daughter takes better care of her new puppy than she took care of Hachi.",1501027200,,507,4.326315789473684

4049716,4,B0031RAOVY,"This is a very nice, heartfelt film. It's really interesting to read some of the one-star reviews that talk about bad acting and a bad script--what the people who wrote those don't seem to get is that this really was an attempt to make a movie from a dog's perspective, and I admire it for that.  It was quite effective most of the time. The main reason for four stars instead of five was one scene that was so silly that it almost ruined the whole film--we're supposed to believe that a skunk kept the dog captive in that garage for an entire afternoon? Why would a skunk stay in the same place, keeping the dog in there so that it couldn't go to the station? It's simply a forced and contrived scene that took away from the whole effect of the film.

The actors aren't the dominant part of the film--the dog is. In order to write a script that accomplishes that--something that isn't done often--it's necessary to diminish the roles of the actors in order to strengthen the presence of the animal. When all is said and done, all of the humans in the film are supporting actors, and that's how it should be--but we shouldn't judge the acting or the script based on our expectations based on the standard human-based script. This film works on many different levels, but if you want to enjoy it, leave behind some of your expectations of what a film should be.",1489795200,6,1360,4.436

4049720,5,B0031RAOVY,"Hachi: A Dogs Tale (2009) is a true dog story.  No, no  not a bad movie, its a great movie, a truly great movie.  Truly, and true to the real-life story of a Japanese Hachi-Ko who lived in an earlier century.  Truly a dog story, because it is all about a dog, not just about the people who lived with the dog, as most dog stories are.  If you love dogs, the images of Hachi are irresistible.  And a truly great movie, for many reasons.  The imagery is simply gorgeous.  The acting superb, all around.  The musical score hauntingly unforgettable.  The screenplay well paced, avoiding over-sentimentality in a story that has to bring tears to the eyes of any red-blooded person.

It is a movie that works on many levels.  For its purely sentimental plot about a dog who never gave up loving his master, it conveys the story effectively such that any child can enjoy.  (And the plot is framed by the telling of the young boy who has grown up hearing the story, and now is telling it to his classmates at school.)  This is where its charm as a true dog story is unparalleled.

On another level, it is a re-make of the Japanese film (1987) entitled Hachiko Monogatari, which is based more literally upon the life of the original Hachi-Ko.  The Japanese film interprets his life story as a morality tale, in sombre tones of reproach for all the failures of human actors who fail Hachi in some way.  The American re-make inverts the dark tone, translating it into a kinder, gentler tale.  Love abounds in the life of this dog.  Half of the film depicts the joyous companionship of the music professor and his dog.  The professor and his wife enjoy a happy, loving marriage, and secondary characters are also portrayed in warm tones.

An interesting technique is to visualize Hachis perspective towards humans in nearly colorless images, whereas the human perspective contrasts in full color.  We see Hachi lying in his back yard while the professors wife tends to her garden.  Hachi watches her.  He rolls over onto his side, seeing her image with gravity on one side.  Then rolls onto his back, seeing her completely upside down.  Is this just to drive home the issue of contrasting viewpoints as it relates to the morality of this tale?  Or is it also to reveal how an uncritical mind accepts reality, as Hachi sees it, and not just as a human mind expects to see it?

There is a critical scene at the center of the movie, where a Japanese guru-figure reads briefly at the graveside, speaking of a philosophy of unconditional love and unconditional acceptance.  I cannot help but see the morality of this film in the context of this scene, which is probably too fleeting (my only criticism of the film).  Hachi accepts unconditionally what his master can give to him, limited as it has to be; he sees life just as it is.  But Hachi loves totally and gives himself without limitation.  The professor too accepts Hachis unwillingness to play fetch, no matter how much he wishes for his dog to make him happy in this token way  until the final day, when Hachi seems to have forewarning of his masters death, and he begs him to stay home and cavorts with him, fetching ball for the first and only time.  When the professor falls in an apparent heart attack, he drops that ball he has been holding.

At this deeper level, in my understanding of the story, there is again the failing of secondary human characters to fully engage Hachi, in the unconditional terms portrayed in the relationship of Hachi and his master. After her fathers death, the professors daughter sincerely offers Hachi a home, but she cannot fulfill her commitment completely.  Her family has to come first.  At least she has the understanding to give Hachi her permission to leave, to live on the streets, free to live out his own imperative.  And so do others, allowing Hachi to do what he has to do.  The shift of seasons through the years, the flow of life, passes gently.  Only the hotdog stand owner comes close to standing by his promise to look after the dog as Hachi pursues his lonely life, waiting.  So Hachi waits, for 10 years, and only in his final moments of transcendental imagination experiences his reunion with the man whom he has always loved and will always love.

It is easy for me to transpose Hachis morality tale to my own life.  I have never lived with a dog, but with many cats.  The meaning is the same.  Animals are capable of an unconditional love which humans find difficult to emulate.  We can only go so far in devoting our lives to them, as they devote themselves to us. It is with that knowledge, and that ultimate regret, that I will leave the rest unspoken.",1489276800,13,4655,4.560916767189385

Besides the absolutely depressing story, the movie itself was so slow to unfold. I had no idea where is was going and then, I wished I didn't know.

Hachi is not without its disappointments, however: I kept holding my breath for the ""there's nothing' in the rules that says a dog can't play baseball"" moment that never transpired. I also found myself questioning Hachi's loyalty for a few brief moments. A famine or, perhaps, a devastating pyroclastic flow enveloping all in its path could have convinced me, but the director removed these scenes from the final cut for some reason.

The dog wasn't credited at the end of the film, which can only mean that Hachi was likely portrayed by ten different dogs that each knew one or two tricks. That really took me out of it.",1481587200,,840,4.556291390728477

4050099,5,B0031RAOVY,"The Richard Gere-Hollywood Hachi movie is very emotional, heartwarming and delivers a great message of about patience, loyalty and that you should never forget the ones you loved. Its a quiet story with a lot of texture in its simplicity and it tells the essential story of Hachi returning to the train station for 10 years to wait for the professor.

As good as the Gere movie is, its a shadow of the true Hachi tale. The real life of Hachi is significantly more improbable, dramatic and truly incredible.

One example of the difference is in the opening scene of the American version of the film. It shows Hachi as a puppy being placed in a crate by a Shinto priest and shipped via truck, plane and train and eventually delivered to the fictitious Benbridge train depot.
The real story of Hachis journey from his birthplace to the Shibuya train station was recounted by the Endo, Teru the sculptor of the famous Hachi statue.

Endo remarked, In 1934, Hachiko's first statue was placed at Shibuya Station.  The photo of a relaxed Hachi (above) was taken around that time by the late Isamu Yamamoto, a former bank employee who lived in the Shibuya Ward, Tokyo.  Yamamoto's family found the photo and presented it to Ando who sculpted the Hachiko statue we see today.  I have never looked at such a photo that caught the atmosphere of Hachikos everyday life at that time so well, Ando said.
On Hachi's birthday, I think back to the first months of his life. I can imagine a plump squirming puppy playing with his four male siblings in a barn. Hachi was born on a farm in snow country- Odate, Akita prefecture- to a wealthy landlord farmer.  At two months old, he was gifted to professor Ueno Hidesaburo from a former student.  On January 14, 1924, Hachi was placed in a small tightly-knit straw crate for his journey.  Straw crates were heat retaining and also used to carry rice.

Three people walked 12.5 miles to date Station, carrying Hachi in the midst of a snow storm. Hachi departed date Station at 3: 20 PM and scheduled to arrive at Ueno Station in Tokyo at 8: 50 AM the next day. In that blizzard, Hachi left his birthplace never to return.
The date-Ueno route ran through a series of mountain ranges, and included one of the steepest approaches to a pass for trains in Japan. The train climbed up and down mountain peaks and passed through numerous tunnels. The train oscillated wildly and the locomotives gave off thick soot.
It must have been a terrifying experience for the two-month old puppy. He was separated from his mother and siblings, carried outside in a blizzard, and sat in a crate on a bumpy train for 20 hours. On the day of Hachi's arrival, the newspapers reported that Tokyo was hit by a strong earthquake, by a windstorm, and a sandstorm was blowing over the capital city. People thought Hachi was dead when he arrived.
Queisse, Ive thought a lot about the story over the past year. One day it dawned on me that Hachi is much more than a sentimental story. Its actually a metaphor for the human predicament.

 Hachi spent most of his life mourning the death of his beloved master, Professor Uneo , a renowned agricultural engineer. (In the Richared Gere movie it was Parker Wilson a music professor). If Hachi did not comprehend Uenos death, Hachi lived most of his life missing him. Hachi lived with with Uneo for only a year and four months. These were Hachis happy times. After Uneos death, people saw Hachi walking with his head down as if he were sad and depressed. He did not wag his tale. This unfortunate life of Hachi paradoxically created the legend of the loyal dog Hachiko and Hachi became a permanent fixture of Japanese popular culture and the amazing story spread throughout the world.",1475539200,8,3728,4.623298033282905

Yes, it tells a story of loyalty, but it would have been much better as a short film instead of a full feature.  For the first 40 minutes of the film, I didn't know what the point of it was - a repetition of a dog following a man around.  Similarly after then big turn in the story, the last 1/2 of the film could have been told in 10 minutes.

4050249,5,B0031RAOVY,"I had heard the story of the loyal Akita who, when his master died, returned to the train station for over nine years, waiting for his return.  That was a true story that took place in Japan in the late 30's.  This version takes place in America, however I'm not sure what year it is; although the look of the film is quite contemporary, so maybe that's what the director was aiming for in order to help his audience relate to the characters more easily.
The multicultural cast was just wonderful, especially Richard Gere and Joan Allen who portrayed a happily married couple, which is refreshing to see in a movie nowadays.  However, the dogs, all of them used in the film, (from puppy to quite aged) were luminous.  I kept telling myself, ""I'm not going to cry over a movie about a dog!""  But I ended up bawling at the end, anyway.",1465689600,4,833,4.4183006535947715

I'm actually surprised that people have wanted to buy or adopt Akitas specifically after watching this. It never occurred to me to focus on that breed. It does, however, make me want to adopt a dog. There are so many other breeds, and even mongrels, who are just as sweet and loyal. Tons of rescued animals need homes. I've even had a cat that was about as Hachi-like as a cat could be.

4050322,5,B0031RAOVY,We have an 8 year old American Akita that weighs 90 Lbs. Our Akita does not fetch or play catch either.  She likes to wrestle with our 4 1/2 Lb. chihuahua and us.  She watches T.V. and followed Hachi's every movement.  I can picture her doing the same thing.  Perhaps Hachi would have had closure if he had been at the funeral.

4050327,3,B0031RAOVY,"I am conflicted on how to feel about this movie. This is a great story for showing the loyalty of the dog Hachiko to his master. But it also shows how poorly his so-called family treated Hachiko. Apparently his master was the only one who really took care of him. The wife basically ignored him. The daughter and her family tried but really didn't have any time or energy for him. What really made me mad was how the movie romanticized the abandonment of Hachiko by his family. The daughter says ""if you have to go, go."" Seriously?! If you cared so much, put a collar on him. Drop him off at the station in the morning and pick him up at night. Give him a proper meal everyday and let him sleep in a warm place, not abandon him because you can't handle him.

4050376,5,B0031RAOVY,"Good clean family entertainment (a rarity today) centering around the story of ""Hachi-ko"" the famous Akita who was born November 10, 1923 in Odate, Japan. This is an Americanized version of the story shot in Rhode Island and differs from the true story of Hachiko in many details. The real owner of Hachiko was professor Eizaburo Ueno who was a professor of agriculture at the then Imperial Tokyo University and he was the founder of modern farming practices involving irrigation and drainage. In this film Hollywood has Richard Gere (""professor Parker"") as a music and performing arts professor (perhaps this is a more acceptable line of teaching to Hollywood producers?) who happens upon the little lost Hachiko (""Hachi"" in this film) when his cage falls off a truck and the puppy breaks out near the train station where Parker arrives home from work every day. This differs from the true story wherein professor Ueno actually received the puppy as a gift from one of his students. The professor makes an effort to find the owner, but to no avail. From this point onward the film does not veer too drastically from the true story and I wish to say that the acting was very good (very believable performance from Richard Gere ) on the part of all involved. The dog grows up and bonds to professor Parker, and waits for him every day at the train station to come home. One day, Parker does not come home again and never will since he has passed away at work. But Hachi returns faithfully to the train station to await the return of his owner every day for more than nine years (true fact) . The ending is both sad and sweet (in a spiritual sense) and I will not spoil it for you if you. If you love dogs (or animals in general) and are at all prone to tears, you will need to equip yourself with a box of Kleenex to view this film. I liked the story and admired this dog's loyalty so much that I ordered the one remaining copy of the original Japanese version of this movie.",1462492800,,1974,4.486111111111111

4050403,5,B0031RAOVY,"Todays movies are sometimes shadows of stories that have faded in time or memory. Today, car chase action is a given and has come a long journey since Steve McQueens Bullitt (1968) chase scenes driving a 1968 Ford Mustang 390 GT 2+2 Fastback. His characters final look in a mirror is a hard-to-copy moment of truth in a visual struggle to reveal tales of struggle and truth. Both action scenes have been reproduced some well, some not so 

There are also other movies quite different in their quest to gain your appeal.

This one will move your heart to this idea: the meaning of loyalty  never forget anyone that you love.

There are at least two versions of this true story of loyalty - even after death - and both are recommended:
Hachi-ko (1987) [Hachiko monogatari; original title; see it here: [...]] youll have to manually set English subtitles and withstand the onslaught of advertising - not the  best viewing enjoyment; therefore, it is probably better purchase the CD or see:
the American version, Hachi: A Dogs Story (2009) with Richard Gere, Joan Allen (Jason Bourne trilogy) directed by Lasse Hallstrm.

For me, the American version is more satisfying which I find is the opposite for The Magnificent Seven (1960). In that case, director Akira Kurosawas Shichinin no samurai (1954) [The Seven Samarai], even without English subs, is the preferred way to watch and listen to the same story line.

The story is based on a true story.

The time period, the country the story occurred and some of the circumstances didn't line up at all.  My 12 year old granddaughter was bored and my 5 year old granddaughter fell asleep.

4050600,5,B0031RAOVY,"The film HACHI will forever be in my heart with bittersweet memories of a poignant goodbye to a beloved companion. I will explain later, but first I will give well-deserved praise to a beautiful film that is based on a true story that is a legend in Japan.
I bought HACHI months ago but had hesitated to watch it knowing it would be a tearjerker.  Finally,  I was up to watch an uplifting and inspirational story of love, loyalty and friendship. I know the true story of Hachi and I wondered how a Hollywood movie would translate the Japanese iconic story into an American film. Hachi was the beloved companion to a professor in Japan.  Each day, Hachi  would go to the train station and  patiently wait for his human to return home from work.  I won't give away any details but will say fate intervenes in the lives of Hachi and his human. A story of amazing loyalty and love is born.
In the American telling of the HACHI story,  Richard Gere is the professor. Some mystical destiny brings the professor and Hachi together. It was meant to be. Here is a delightful and sweet story of a man and dog whose love and respect for each other never ends. Its refreshing to have a true story about a dog that does not involve any mistreatment or bad people trying to do harm. Every second of this film is about love and kindness. Richard Gere absolutely shines with joy and happiness in every scene with Hachi. It's clear there is chemistry between Gere and the dogs playing Hachi.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast including Joan Allen and Jason Alexander are actually distractions to the film. Allen and Alexander are fine actors but both seem rather limp in this film.  Its the professor and Hachi that wins our hearts.
Any scene of Hachi, whether as a puppy or as an adult dog, is precious. And any scene of Gere and Hachi interacting with love and exuberant joy will warm any heart.  A  beautiful story unfolds of an unbreakable bond between a human and a dog.
As I mentioned, I waited months to watch this film. I finally decided  it was time to experience HACHI. My elderly loyal German Shepherd named True was at my side as always.  Tears filled my eyes when  I saw Hachi in old age. I looked at my girl True knowing our time together was slowly coming to a close. Little did I know that end came the very next day due to undiagnosed advanced cancer. After I watched HACHI, I felt the need to give True some extra love, hugs and attention. Fate guided me to  watch HACHI that night.  I will be forever grateful for the  loving last evening with True.",1453420800,9,2554,4.423076923076923

4050603,5,B0031RAOVY,"As a dog owner I know the love a very loyal dog feels for it's owner and vice versa.  I became a dog owner in 2009 and got my second dog in 2012, she is a different breed than Hachi but this movie definitely reminded me of her and how she is with me.  She has to always be with me or see me at the very least, she is my soulmate in animal form.  I enjoyed this movie and watching Hachi's entire life span.  I related so much to Richard Gere and his love for Hachi.  I was so hoping he was going to keep her in the beginning.  It was obvious they were meant for each other and their bond was so strong.  Seeing how Hachi wanted to meet him daily after work and walk him to work was so beautiful.  Definitely not something one could do in real life where people steal dogs and then there is the dog catcher, of course.  I was worried about Hachi but knew even though this is not something that could realistically happen in my town, it was a nice addition to the movie (in a safer town where everyone knows each other) and really showed how strong their bond was.  My heart literally broke when Richard Gere (Parker) died, more for Hachi then anyone else.  It was sad to watch from that point forward...I just sat crying.  It was a beautiful movie but definitely a tear jerker.  I am going to recommend this to my parents, I think they will really like it as well.",1453420800,,1362,4.09433962264151

4050614,3,B0031RAOVY,"If the movie was about a true story, why not make the story true-to-life? Since Hachi was a real Dog, Why not tell his REAL story? I don't think it was necessary to ""Americanize"" Hachis compelling story of loyalty, love and devotion. I liked the movie but was disappointed in the end to find out the real Hachi was born in the 1920s and died in 1934 after waiting 10 yrs for his Japanese master. The fact that the whole story was changed around takes away from the impact the movie made on me. HACHI was the star of the story and Richard Gere was just the name that drew people to theatres to sell tickets.. I would have rather seen the real story even if subtitles were needed.",1452902400,,678,4.263565891472868

4050619,5,B0031RAOVY,"Not your typical dog film, ""Hachi"" is truly a special piece. While the character development didn't impress me much, it is the story behind the story that made me cry like a baby for hours on after. I've watched it three times so far, each time asking myself, ""why are you doing this to yourself?"" So why do I? The music and cinematography, simple yet telling, capture the seemingly melancholy mood of the tale perfectly (even though in the beginning, i could not stop aww'ing at the cuteness of Hachi so I was in a good mood). But ultimately, it is the love, devotion and loyalty that the story exemplifies that make me revisit it times after - qualities that i think are difficult to find in their truest forms today. The Professor found those qualities in Hachi. Throughout and long after the movie ended, I found myself thinking about the people (and dogs, of course) that I lost and still love. A good film to me brings out emotions that however depressing, make me a better person. And ""Hachi"" truly did just that, with no special effects whatsoever. Just a simple story about a life-long connection between man and his dog...and tissues.",1452556800,,1144,4.640394088669951

Nice movie",1451433600,,282,3.8448275862068964
4050628,3,B0031RAOVY,"I had high expectations for this movie because of all the good reviews.

For me, it was just an okay movie.  The dialogue is not really anything special, and the one thing you would want is for there to be a connection between the dog and the owner, but we don't get much depth of character to either or their relationship.  All we know is that the owner is a Professor and he seems to be a good guy.  Other than that, there is not range of emotion or any insight as to who the Professor is.  So, when the Professor dies, I didn't feel that sad.

As for the dog, I guess that breed of dog just doesn't have much facial expressions, and the character of the dog is like that of any other dog; it's just that Hachi sits at the station for years for his owner who never comes.

The movie is kind of melancholy all throughout, with a piano theme that kind of gets monotonous.  I guess I would have liked a little bit more humor, more interesting parts with more substantial story or subplots or events.  It's basically just about a dog who is found by a nice man and then the man dies and the dog waits at the station every day for years.  Great idea for a story/movie, but could have been a lot more than it was.",1451433600,,1209,4.1063829787234045

It is sad to reality though that we have to learn the genuine meaning of loyalty, love, and filial friendship from a furry and adorable dog. If this creature can love someone who only knew and nurtured him for a brief period of dog's time to the point that he goes to the same place and on the same time up to the point of his demise to wait for his master's return then why can't we do that to our family and relatives? Why do we have to put them in homes, worst abandon them? Why do we have to curse the same individuals who somehow taught us how to speak? Why?",1448582400,,628,4.032

Every day around 3 pm my dog goes to the front door and sits until I come home. So I can definitely relate to the first part of the movie. The second part would probably apply to my dog Tramp, but I never want to find out.

4050867,3,B0031RAOVY,"Nice enough, but not a very deep or profound retelling of a true and wonderful story. Transplanting the original story from 1920's Japan to 2000 US is only partially successful. Some changes were too obviously made to increase the appeal of the film, but were not at all necessary. For example, while the dog's original owner was a professor of agriculture, in this film version, Richard Gere plays a professor of music and a composer (of doubtful quality).

My dog was like Hachi, and if she had outlived me-she would've waited by a certain window and never left it watching for me to come home. No one would've been able to dislodge or bribe her.

4051137,3,B0031RAOVY,"I saw a story regarding Hachi on the web and discovered there was a movie with with Richard Gere called Hachi: A Dog's Tale. I thought it was a good movie but I have to admit after watching it two days it still hurts to know that a dog was treated this way. SPOILERS AHEAD. FYI I did watch the Japanese version and it is slightly different. The owner, Richard Gere, finds the dog running lose in the train station. Apparently, the dog was sent from Japan and the tag was partially ripped on the dog's crate. In turn Gere couldn't locate the dog's owner. He decides to keep Hachi but his wife isn't too happy but decides it's okay. Hachi lives in a shed outside despite bad weather. We go on to the dog escaping the backyard since he wants to be there for Gere. He does that for quite some time but then Gere doesn't show because he has collapsed in his music class. The poor dog isn't told anything about his owner's death. Gere's daughter decides to take Hachi in since her mother decides to sell the house but he escapes to wait at the train station. The daughter and her husband find Hachi and she says okay you can come here. Basically, fine you can fend for yourself. Hachi lives under a train cart and continues to await his owner. He gets food scraps from vendors but no one takes him in. At some point the wife revisits the town and discovers Hachi, pets him and leaves but does nothing for his well being. In the end the dog passes away at the train station and dreams about his owner. So very sad. The Japanese version is similar in certain aspects. In the Japanese version the owner adopts Hachi since his daughter says she will take care of the dog. But then she gets pregnant out of wedlock. A little while later she gets married then the owner wants to find someone else to take Hachi, no one does. Hachi spends nights out in a shed again. The wife isn't happy and in fact gets very jealous. The jealousy is much more noticeable in this version. Another difference is that Hachi is present at his owner's funeral and the wife tries to find an owner for the dog . In the end one of the better owner's dies, yes, another person dies and his wife tells Hachi to fend for himself. Later on the wife returns and discovers Hachi again feels badly and tries to help Hachi but he runs away. The wife asks around if anyone has seen Hachi but then leaves. The people in town really do not like Hachi but in the American version they seem to a little more. In the end Hachi passes away, looking old and so sad to look at just as in the American version. They pan in on the wife showing her with two puppy Akitas. Very different than the American version. In the Japanese version the wife to me just seems a lot more cold and bitter. Despite the fact she tried to find a place for Hachi to live. She did at some point. Hachi spent some time at her Uncle's but they kept Hachi chained up in the horrible weather. He just kept running away to the train station in turn the Uncle got tired and gave up. A very sad story and very sad how they treated this beautiful dog. No one would take this beautiful creature in. Yes, Hachi wanted to wait for his master whom never would return but dogs don't understand death. He needed to be loved and comforted and that didn't happen here. The way he was treated was unbearable to me and I cried a lot. I mean alot. Watch if you like but get a box of tissues. I found the Japanese version on YouTube with subtitles.",1438041600,8,3453,4.233333333333333

4051144,3,B0031RAOVY,"I did not go into this movie knowing that it is a tribute to an actual dog, whose loyalty is so known and celebrated that there is a statue of him in Japan.  Had I known that, I might have had a different experience.  I am giving it a third star with that in mind.

When my family got this movie from Redbox, we made a couple of faulty assumptions. 1) We thought that, since the movie was about a dog, it would probably be uplifting for us after a hard day and a recent death in the family.  2)  We saw A-list actors in the cast (Richard Gere, Joan Allen and Jason Alexander) and assumed that some part of the story might concern their relationships with each other and not just with Hachi, the dog.

Without spelling out spoilers, heres how the movie plays out.  Its mainly told from Hachis point of view. This means that all the interactions between the actors are fluffy, idealized vignettes, kind of like a sitcom except that they aren't exactly funny.  Gere, Allen, and Alexander don't do much of anything other than feed the dog, play with the dog, and discuss the dog.  Just when you're asking yourself when or whether an actual plot event is going to occur, a bomb drops out of nowhere and things become INCREDIBLY SAD.  No physical harm comes to Hachi, but trust me, if you love dogs enough to want to see this movie, you are going to be majorly bummed out by his situation.

This movie is beautifully filmed and sweet, but if you go into it without knowing what it is, you will be lulled and perplexed by the blandness of the first two-thirds, then punched in the gut by the final third.  Its like, first you're dozing off and then you're devastated.  If you want to see this to find out why the dog its based on is so famous, just be clear on what it is you're getting, and give the people watching a heads-up.",1437782400,2,1821,4.2894736842105265
4051145,5,B0031RAOVY,"If you own a dog and consider him a part of your family, you must see this movie!  Hachi is a heart-warming story about a puppy who finds its way to the heart of a loving family.  As he grows, a strong bond of loyalty begins to take shape between Hachi and his owner (Richard Gere).  What happens next is absolutely astounding.  You will love this film for many reasons.  Buy it!  I guarantee you'll love it  .  .  .  .",1437696000,,419,4.061728395061729

4051163,5,B0031RAOVY,I have been using my Fire TV and since I have a Prime account I have been getting free movies and this movie was on my free movie list. And I am so glad I watched it. It's about a man and a dog that walked into his life and the friendship and dedication they had for one another showed to the end of the movie. This movie touched my heart and brought up a lot of emotions with what I have been dealing with the last few years. Not sure if others will feel the same about this movie.

This is based on a true story that actually happened in Japan, and there is a Japanese version of this film also.

So that said, I was a bit hesitant about viewing this movie.  But, decided too cause I am a huge Richard Gere fan.  Well I was pleasantly surprised.  While it had some happy moments, and it was nice to see the wife come around to letting him keep the puppy, it was a very sad movie.  I didn't think I could be so touched about the story line and did end up shedding a few tears.  I gave it a five as I have always said that when a movie can move me so emotionally it is well worth watching and I recommend this movie now to my family and friends.  Might be a little too sad for younger children, especially those with pets.",1434499200,,782,3.9050632911392404

4051505,5,B0031RAOVY,"Had my husband, myself and my 23 year old son crying. We love dogs and thinking about a dog waiting for his person to come home and no one able to convey that he cannot, is sad. When my kids come home from college my dogs are so happy. But Anita dogs are 1 person dogs and if they are gone, it must be unbearable for them. I believe dogs grieve too and this movie beautifully portrays that",1431216000,3,389,4.0

Add in a wife who won't let the dog stay in the house and apparently doesn't care about it at all, to a host of other supporting characters who think the dog can live on hot dog ends, sleeping under a railroad car and you have a heartwarming - nope, heartchilling story.  My children cried, I cursed Amazon for suggesting it as a child's movie.  And then I sat them down and explained that dogs need caring owners throughout their lives, and that we NEVER WALK ON TRAIN TRACKS. Even if we have a cute, unleashed puppy with us.  Jeez, next time I'll just let them watch Back to the Future, even the PG content on that would be easier than Hachi.",1431129600,2,815,4.266233766233766

The validity of the story rang deep in their hearts a midst their normal superhero fare. Important casual conversation about loyalty, values, relationships, death, the unexpected, and community all happened. A great pick for our family!",1428796800,,335,5.339622641509434

4051647,5,B0031RAOVY,"I heard about Hachi when it first came out, but was not too thrilled about watching a ""sad"" dog movie. Every once in a while I'll watch a sad movie, but hardly cry in any of them. I cried and cried when I finally watched Hachi this year. All the way through the end of the credits and after the movie was all over. I don't think there will ever be another movie that could make me cry like this did. My dog passed away 3 months ago, and it was definitely too soon to watch this movie. I know that is the main reason why I cried, because I could relate to the love that the professor and his dog shared, and also the love of his family and their time of grief. And while most pets may not act like Hachi did, Hachi also reflects the reverse, the love we have for our pets and for each other. It is a terrific movie about an undying love and unending loyalty.

As another reviewer mentioned, I agree that this is the best dog movie I've seen. It was touching in all the right moments, nothing surprising to a dog-lover. The music score was amazing and sets the mood of the film so well, no words just beautiful music.",1428624000,3,1115,4.091324200913242

4051655,5,B0031RAOVY,"Pet owners beware: make sure to have an extra box of Kleenex available when you watch this. It's a different kind of love story. The kind that only animal lovers (especially dog lovers) can truly relate to. And being that it is based upon a true story, makes this family-friendly film even more heart wrenching. After you watch it, you'll want to give your pet an extra treat and a big hug! Don't ever take their love for granted again

Oh I almost forgot, Richard Gere is pretty good too..",1428537600,2,490,4.444444444444445

The importance of life and the caring of our loved ones and unexpected bittersweet memories to be treasured. Friends and strangers, really there are no strangers, just friends we haven't met yet.  Open you hearts to the love that we have been given which strengthens us and give it freely to the broken people around us. I gave this to my Uncle Jack years ago, he's 90 years old/young. He mentioned to me he had only watched half of it and couldn't find it. I ordered for him and had it sent directly to him and let me tell you, he is so delighted, I thank you for your service.

4051684,2,B0031RAOVY,"Sooooooooooooooo painfully sloooooooooooooooow. The only reason I did not give it one star is because it is based on a true and endearing story of a faithful dog, and that it is a good reminder of the faithfulness and love that such creatures offer us and how much we owe them. There is a bit of overacting on the part of Layla with all the head tilting, but perhaps that was an homage to Benji. The transplantation of the story to the US helps people here to relate to the story but in an affluent society but it is very, very improbable that such a dog would be left on its own. I expect a true story to be believable and this was not. Some of the dialogue is not believable as when the people act all gruff.",1427932800,,710,4.1521739130434785

Even the Professor wasn't man enough to stand up to his overbearing wife and give Hachi a warm place inside, where a cherished friend should be.  Then when the Professor dies, and not one person in that entire town had a heart to open up for that precious loving dog, that is cruelty beyond reason.  They watched, uncaring, unfeeling, year after year, and NEVER EVER took that beautiful animal into their arms, their hearts and their homes.  That this is based on a true story - that somewhere, a town full of people treated one of God's creatures this deplorably - and then someone thought it would make a ""heartwarming movie""?!?!  REALLY!?  That is what is really sickening.  This is the most retched movie I have ever seen.

I thought Richard Gere, as the star of the film, brought a refreshing feeling where his character was not too overbearing or dominating, which is the case in most films and most stars.  But this true story was told in a different continent, with a different society.  This is the norm for films that say ""based"" on a true story.  Fimmakers need to tell the story from where it took place.  Otherwise, might as well categorize it under fiction.

It's heartbreaking and meaningful and so much more than a ""dog story"": it's about our deepest connections and how they transcend our limited view of reality.  ""Hachiko"" is a great story about a noble animal, a great teacher, and one man's closest companion.

""Hachi"" is a great, too rare exception to that rule.  Being based on a true story amplifies the inspiration because it actually happened and happened here on terra firma, not in some distant galaxy a long time ago.

That all of the elements, themselves, are of such high quality adds to the whole experience:  director Lasse Hallstrom; actors Richard Gere, Joan Allen and a dozen other players; the way it looks and sounds with particularly beautiful music.

One of those rare movies that is full of grown-up sights and sounds and feelings that are just right for children, as well, leaving everyone uplifted and feeling good about being human.",1426636800,,811,4.9338235294117645

Very hard to shoot animals and look naturalistic. So it is impressive that the dog can act or looks like it's not acting. . will make you cry. Part of the charm is the music & piano composition.

I am so glad I did, what a wonderful story that is great for the whole family to watch. I had no idea this film came out in 2009 which was a shocker, because I just rented through Redbox. The movie is excellent, but it is a tear jerker, never fear there are some comical moments in the film. A great film you will enjoy, if you liked Marley and Me you will like this. It is a heartwarming story I had to buy after renting it, an amazing film based on a true story.

4052177,1,B0031RAOVY,"This movie was well done, but it is celebrating a pretty awful standard of raising a dog. These guys are just awful dog owners, and the fact that the dog survived long enough to get abandoned by Richard Gere's crappy family is a miracle, due to the fact that the whole movie the dog is running around in the street completely unsupervised, even before anyone knows who he is. He probably went back to that town because it was the only place where he thought he could get food, since Richard Gere's family basically cut him loose immediately after he ran away one freaking time. Also, I would say that this movie missed its stated moral of 'Never forget the ones you love', and solidly landed on, 'If you morbidly obsess about the people who you love who die, you will end up dying alone and homeless by a train station, getting by on discarded pieces of hot dog, while your old family moves on with their life and probably has already replaced you.' If your dog is sad, and misses his old life, you give him something new to be excited and happy about somewhere else. That kid is probably going to get a B+ on his hero report, and his moron parents are going to put him out on the street, too.",1421452800,6,1193,4.330357142857143
4052178,2,B0031RAOVY,"as someone else mentions, it's actually a movie about the abandoned dog and his irresponsible owner (the wife).  As I watched this movie with different friends a few times, I researched about the original Hachi in Japan, and he was more of the hungry dog who went to the train station to get the food rather than waiting for a missing owner after owner's death.  It started annoying to hear Richard Gere's pronunciation of ""Hah-cheay"" many times

I saw ""a dog's tale"" and thought it must be a lighthearted movie.  Especially after I realized richard gere was in it...but then half way through, the tears started and never stopped. It's a powerful movie and for that reason I think it's good, but only watch this if you feel like a good cry and don't have to go out in public afterward.",1421280000,,496,4.2

4052204,4,B0031RAOVY,"I would give this five stars, except I cannot get past the way the family treated Hachi after Richard Gere's character died. The movie was beautiful in the owner/dog devotion and love. Unfortunately, the family abandoned Hachi and left him to fend for himself when they couldn't keep him from going to the train station every day. They did nothing to care for him, to ensure he was warm at night, loved, fed, or comforted in his grief... all the things that responsible pet owners do. Instead, they moved away and forgot about Hachi. So the last ten years of Hachi's life were spent waiting for an owner who would never return without a loving home to return to everyday.

The movie could have been well done if the family had not abandoned the dog. It missed the mark by trying to justify the family's actions, but honestly, there is no justification for what they did. Other than that, which was a huge negative, the movie was beautiful and a real tear-jerker. I hated the family at the end, but loved Hachi.",1420848000,,1010,4.549450549450549

4052245,5,B0031RAOVY,"I just love this movie, what a great true story about a man and his dog. This is a true story what really happened to a man and his Akita dog in Japan originally. It was redone here set in the  U.S.A. instead , however it is very well done ,Richard Gere is great and so is the dog and the rest of the cast. If you have a heart and love animals you will love this film and cry for sure as I did. It really is a sad and depressing movie but it is reality of life , that unlike many American films where everything is perfect and ends happily ever after makes this film special because it is the opposite. The reality is life is more cruel and sad than kind , The bond and love between Richard Gere and his dog Haichi in the film is just excellent, you feel for both of them and you love the movie for that and the actors in this film. This is a really nice movie for yourself or the family to watch together , even  the most macho or black hearted person will turn to tears after watching this movie or else they truly are not human and have no soul or feelings. Highly recommended  for your collection a movie worth owning.",1420502400,3,1122,4.0

4052358,5,B0031RAOVY,"Loved this story... Hachi's tale is similar to the Greyfriar's Bobby story of the little dog in Edinborough that sleeps on its master's grave; it shows the loyalty and feelings between dog and owner in a believable, natural way that anyone who has ever had a dog can relate to. It's a love story - a love at first sight story -  between a man, and his dog - whom he adopts against the wishes of his wife. The relationships between the main characters are deep and real, and never corny.  Lasse Halstrom directs Hachi the dog as a character in his own right, managing to maintain his canine identity and integrity, yet allowing us to love him, and to identify with his expressions of joy and sorrow. Richard Gere and Joan Allen shine in their roles as a middle-aged married couple without a lot of personal angst. You can like and respect them. They each have their own creative profession. The daily rituals of dog and human, the moments of play and affection, touch the heart. This movie is real entertainment for people of all ages. Keep some tissues handy, as you will most likely be sobbing.",1419984000,,1095,4.525252525252525

Okay so my children are the biggest animal lover EVER!  We even did a funeral for my daughters snail that died, it lived for 2 days.
I was looking for Dog Movies on Amazon instant video and came across this movie.  I though, ""Oh yay!  A dog movie for my family!  Great!""  So I told my family after dinner that we would watch a ""Family movie"" because I found this really cute animal movie online and we can stream it on there Xbox or what ever they have.  We sat down and started the movie.  It was great at first!  My kids where cooing over the cute little puppy.  It was the cutest little dog ever!  So then it happened,  the man died.  Oh no oh no oh no OH NO!  THIS MOVIE IS NOT GOING TO TURN OUT GOOD UH OH!  So then they panned to the dog.  The tears!  Oh the tears!  Then the dog got old, I knew this movie was going to turn out bad... I said, ""Hey kids!  How about we watch another movie!""  I don't think they heard me with all the tears.  The dog sat and waited, and waited, and waited.  I was sitting and could not help crying to.  The amount of tear my whole family produced was enough to bring back The Great Flood.  Then the dog died.  Oh the screams and the cries and the tears and my thoughts while I was getting light headed I cried so hard was, ""W-w-w-worst m-movie ever!""  The whole night was, ""MOM!!!! WHY!  OH WHY!!!!""  I was crying so hard.  My little was hugging me saying, ""MOM!!!! I can't B-b-b-BREATH!!!""

Even though it hits really hard in the feels, this is not a depressing movie.  Dog owners will want to make sure their fur buddy is close, because there may be an overwhelming desire to look deep into your dog's eyes, before giving a warm hug.  This file is based on true circumstances that happened in Japan in the 1930's.  I thought an interesting aspect of the filming, was certain scenes were filmed as seen through a dog's eyes.

4053316,1,B0031RAOVY,"The people in that town should be ashamed. They let this poor dog freeze to death. No wonder Hatchi waited for his only friend, when even the bitchy wife couldn't be bothered with the dog from even when he was a puppy. The daughter and her family were no better. They let the brat torment this obviously grieving and uprooted dog. They made him stay outside even when it was cold and snowing! And finally, the most irresponsible behavior of letting him go be a homeless train hobo. Everyone in Hachi's life let him down, except for one person, and that is why he died frozen, waiting for him at the train station. Deplorable! HOW anyone thinks this is a heartwarming tale is an idiot! This is a tale of abandonment and neglect.

*edit* I am reviewing THIS movie. I'm not interested in learning about the legend behind this story, because it won't make this movie any better.",1414800000,7,874,4.531645569620253

I didn't know the true story this was based on and going in had no idea what it was going to be about and I think that's the best way to watch this one.  If you like dogs, you've got to give this one a go.  It's much better than many similar movies that tell the same sort of dog/master tale that had bigger marketing budgets.  There is a bit of obvious writers licence and embellishment with a key moment in this one that contradicts the remainder of the movie, but the film is such a powerful emotional tale, that you can forgive that one.",1414800000,,636,4.112903225806452

4053518,5,B0031RAOVY,"My son's neighbor loaned his copy of Hachi for us to view and after seeing it I purchased my own copy!  All of the actors were so great in their roles and of course, Hachi was the star.  I realize that more than one dog was used but it amazed me at how much the dog seemed to love Richard Gere.  After seeing this film, I purchased Hachi-Ko: The Samurai Dog,  written by Shizuko O. Koster.  The Americanized version of this story was very well done and stayed very close to the original.  Some of the dialogue is very quite on the DVD - however there are subtitles so one does not lose the thread of conversation.  The puppy at the beginning of the story is so adorable, I wanted to run right out and get an Akita dog.  If I had a bigger yard, I would!  Purchase this DVD and also the book - you won't regret it and keep the tissues handy.",1404604800,,839,4.067073170731708

Then I feel sad that at that age I didn't give my heart to him.  An idiot neighbor later shot him for going after his stupid chickens.  That's when I really felt the loss. That man was known by neighbors as being evil. 60 years have now passed, and if he were still around I would beset him with a ""friendly"" reminder.",1404172800,,441,4.27710843373494

This could have been my fault...although I have never had this happen before.  This movie however, was not a a big release and most likely an indie and so that is likely why it was in japanese and produced there.  Again, this was likely my fault because I have never come across this before.  The movie is a great story...especially for dog lovers and is truely a great family story.  I had to re-order and finally got the right version.  So problem with the original version was not totally the suppliers fault.",1404172800,,642,4.521739130434782

Loyalty that made me proud of that dog & sad for while he waited all those years, he had cancer all that time (after his master had died) yet he cont'd to wait while suffering the pain from his cancer.
I wish I could be as loyal & stoic as that dog.  A movie every family should watch together.  Respect & love one another because life is too short!",1403481600,,564,4.017857142857143

I'm one of those people that do not believe  you can ""own"" an animal.  Richard Gere is great in this movie.  It has a sad ending but so well told it still leaves you feeling good.  This story is about how a dog brings out the best in people who come in contact with him.  There is a statue erected in his honor at the sight where he spends the rest of his life waiting for Parker ( Gere) to return.  It is my hope that anyone reading this will give this movie a chance.",1402185600,,600,3.941666666666667

4053546,5,B0031RAOVY,"Jeez, this one made me cry for a hour or so afterwards.  Well done and with Richard Gere in it , nothing but excellence.  Not because he is beautiful inside and out, being a Buddhist and all but because he is able to convey just the perfect amount of emotion.  The emotions shown between his puppy and himself are just too endearing.  The ending had me sobbing and sobbing.  I have always been a cat person, they are easy you feed them and then clean the box.  But my new puppy and this movie have made me a dog person too.  I believe if you have ever loved any animal and you watch this movie you can not escape its impact.  It clearly proves that animals are a special gift to humans.  They heal us, made us more patient and give us unexpected tasks.  They constantly forgive us for our shortcomings and stay loyal when we treat them with love. They never tell us our faults, so we must always be tender with them, because if you are not, you will come back as one and reap your karma for sure.  This movie is a real jewel for anyone that has a heart and cares for our little treasures from God, animals and especially dogs of course.",1402012800,8,1136,4.188940092165899

4053598,5,B0031RAOVY,"WHOA this movie was VERY GOOD and VERY clean! No cuss words, not even showing cleavages but very ""G"" rated, true to the rating. This movie is base on a true Japanese story in 1923 but this is the American version. To this day, they still have a statue of the dog at the Train Station in Japan. One of the BEST movies, I've seen too, next to the movie ""God's Not Dead"" playing at AMC theaters right now. I think the Oscars need to star having a Animal award for best Animal Actor/Actress. I am not kidding. Hachi the dog, was a very good actor. I wish Richard Gere would do more of these type of movies because I just loved him in this movie. I wish they made more ""G"" rated movies like this one. These ""G"" rated movies are a breath of sunshine. I wish they made more of them.

Note: I watched this movie on our Clearplay dvd player that filters out the sex, nudity, cuss words, gore, violence, etc. You set the settings, to your preference. My son said he saw this movie without clearplay filters and to him: it was ""G"" rated. They are now coming out with a blu ray dvd player, too. I think Clearplay told me that the new blu ray dvd clearplay player, is coming out in June 2014. Keep checking or call them and ask them to call you and they will.

4053601,5,B0031RAOVY,"For some reason, I had not seen ""Hachi"" until late last year.  But after I saw
the movie, I have seldom gone a day without thinking about the loyal dog sometime
during the day.  ""Hachi"" has a great cast in Richard Gere, Joan Allen, Jason Alexander,
Erick Avari and others, but the real stars of the movie are three Akitas that
play the role of Hachi.  Chico and Layla play the younger adult Hachi while Forrest
plays the older Hachi.  And together with the two Shiba Inus that play the role
of puppy Hachi, they steal the show.

""Hachi"" is based on a true story of one dog's loyalty towards his master.  The dog
sees his master off at the train station every morning and is there in the evening
waiting for him when he returns from work.  After the master fails to show up at
the train station one evening, his dog shows up at the train station every evening,
day after day, year after year, no matter what season it is - whether it is hot or
cold or rainy or snowing. Until finally, one evening, the master finally shows up,
in a manner of speaking, and takes his beloved dog Hachi with him on a special journey.

One of the highlights of the movie is the superb background score by Jan Kaczmarek,
who won the Oscar for his work in ""Finding Neverland"".  In particular, the closing
track, titled ""Goodbye"", is a masterpiece.  The beautiful music certainly adds an
extra dimension to the movie and heightens its impact on the viewer, and the tunes
will linger in the mind long after the movie.

While Chico and Leyla, the Akitas that play the younger Hachi are both very impressive,
it is Forrest, playing the older Hachi with his melancholy eyes, slow walk and a
once-gorgeous coat that has dulled with age, who really tugs at the heartstrings.
My heart went out to the 10+ year old Hachi the first time he is seen in the
movie.  I found myself fervently wishing that something good will happen to him
after so many years of waiting for his master.

All credit to the actors and the director Lasse Hallstrom for bringing the true
story of Hachiko from Japan to an American setting and making a memorable movie of
it.  I would unhesitatingly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever
seen, and undoubtedly the best dog movie I have ever seen - even when I consider
other beautiful dog movies like ""Marley & Me"", ""Red Dog"" and ""My Dog Skip"".

If I could change one aspect of the movie though, I would do this - I would begin
the movie with a scene where the hotdog vendor, Jasjeet, is telling his grandkids
the story of Hachi, and I would end the movie with the camera sweeping heavenward
from the station square where Hachi had laid down on that final, cold winter evening.
And if the movie had to end on a somewhat upbeat note, I would have one of Jasjeet's
grandkids walking an Akita puppy as the closing credits roll.

PS:  Of all the movies I have seen, ""Hachi"" is only the second movie where I have
a desire to visit the actual locations where the scenes were shot (the other one
being ""Shawshank Redemption"").  I have researched and collected the precise
location info for most of the locations for this movie and have posted it under
the Forums-->customer discussions section (topic #5) of this page.",1396051200,3,3216,4.431239388794567
4053602,5,B0031RAOVY,"I loved the movie. Yes, it's sad. Yes, by modern standards it could be considered by some to be a case for animal abandonment and cruelty. Had it been set in Japan in the 1920s, those objections could be overcome. I saw it as a case of the dog's love and loyalty to his owner. The Japanese guy got it. The mom, daughter, and train station people got it. They saw that Akita's don't fetch. They are free spirits. They let him live out his life the way he wanted to. They supported that choice by feeding and watering him.

I love in the country with Karakachans (livestock guardian dogs). My dogs do not bow to any man's rules. They are not bred for that. They live by instinct. They guard what they love. Just like Hachi. If something happened to me, my dog would not go with another human being. He's just not a face licking, tail wagging, treat begging type of dog. He's his own master. So, I get it.",1396051200,,902,4.244186046511628

4053623,5,B0031RAOVY,"I loved this movie despite crying my eyes out.  It was well done with superb acting by all, including Hachi.  It seems slow at times, but I thought that added to the credibility.  Life is slow at times, and this was a story about life.  I can understand the complaints of the 1 star ratings - I too was conflicted about the humans who let the dog determine his own fate - but you can't blame this movie for that.  It was based on a true story, and the real Hachi DID wait at the train station for 10 years.  It wouldn't be a retelling of the story had a family member taken him into their home.  While I believe animals have their own intelligence and I believe we tend to interfere too much in how they live their lives, I too was skeptical about the daughter letting Hachi go ""do what he had to do"".  I suspect the attitude of those who knew Hachi - the daughter, the hot dog vendor, the train station manager, etc. - were portrayed as they were in the movie to avoid the criticism of simply abandoning the dog, even though that's basically what they did.  It was like they abandoned him for a somewhat ""valid"" reason giving Hachi the right to choose his own fate - if a dog is capable of that kind of choice.  I would be interested to know why the people in the real story abandoned him.  Did they also give him credit for deciding his own fate?  Or did they just not care?  At any rate, my point is the movie was an exceptionally well done portrayal of a true story.  Whether or not we like the story is not the fault of the move.",1394150400,2,1534,4.121212121212121

4053680,1,B0031RAOVY,"I saw the high rating for this film--it's a VERY high rating--and foolishly let that be my guide. After the awful experience I had watching this movie, I went back and read the one-star reviews. I sure wish I'd read them FIRST, because it would have spared me the experience of watching this horrible movie.

If you want to spend a solid hour sobbing your face off, this is the movie for you! If you want to see a cute movie about a special relationship between a dog and a human, this movie will just depress you for the rest of the day.

SPOILER ALERT: This review contains detailed descriptions of the plot of this movie.

It starts out with a classroom scene where kids are discussing their heroes. The first kid is talking about how Christopher Columbus (famous for genocide) is her hero. I should have turned it off right then.

Then the little boy starts talking about how Hachi, his grandfather's dog, is his hero. And then we get the story of Hachi.

Hachi is a Japanese dog found by a professor (played by Richard Gere) in the United States. The original true story of this dog took place in Japan, but I suppose Hollywood felt white people would be more lucrative as protagonists and so in the movie Hachi goes through a random convoluted journey for the sole purpose of making sure that the story was set in America, where the dog is found by a white guy.

Then the dog and the professor bond for awhile. Then the professor dies. We overhear the professor's wife comforting her crying daughter, saying, ""It's okay. It's okay."" That was ridiculous. Who tries to tell someone ""It's okay"" when a family member dies? It's not at all ""okay,"" and the widow is the last person who'd say it's okay. That line was just an insult to the intelligence of anyone who's ever lost a loved one.

So the dog then goes home with the professor's daughter, who basically sets him free because he keeps wanting to go to the train station where he used to await the professor (who never came home, the day he died). Really irresponsible toward that dog who had been her father's dog. Appalling, really.

Then we get to watch the dog wait for the professor for more than a decade, until he dies alone in the snow. What's that? You somehow thought the little boy would factor into this? Um, no. For almost the little boy's entire life, the dog has been sitting at the train station alone, while the boy's parents neglect Hachi. The boy and the dog have no relationship.

This is a story about grief and pain. You get to watch this poor dog experience terrible grief and longing. It's really upsetting.

Then at the end, when the dog finally dies alone in the snow, the professor kind of comes back and escorts the dog to Heaven, I guess is what's supposed to be happening in that brief scene. So if you were hoping all this time for some kind of happy ending, you'll have to be satisfied with that.

Pointless, racist, and depressing.",1392163200,14,2922,4.473684210526316

The story of Hachi truely captures the boundless love and commitment a dog feels for its master.

It made me cry at the end to see that for 10 years Hachi waited for his master always hoping for his return.  I loved the way the end was crafted that the master did come to get him as Hachi laying dying of old age.  It is not an uncommon thing nor an unheard thing that an animal actually dies of a broken heart, so it is amazing that Hachi remained faithful and loyal all the way to the end of his life.  It is wonderful that a tribute in the form of a statute is in Japan to honor this noble animal.  Watch it!",1391990400,,673,3.7714285714285714
4053711,5,B0031RAOVY,"This movie reminded me of my dog.  When I got him  he was only a few weeks old,  I had to feed him with a baby bottle.  He was very good natured, and protective of me as he grew to be the beautiful mixed German-sheppard and collie adult.  People often stopped me to ask what kind of beautiful dog he was.  He had the stand up ears, the marking and coloring of a collie, and the size of both breeds.

One day he pulled something heavy off a shelf in the garage that hit him in the head.  I took him to the nearest vetranarian, although I didn't know him.  He examined my dog and said, ""He's OK .  What are you feeding him?""  I told him regular good dog food, and milk bones.  He responded, ""Oh no.  You should feed him fish.  Get some cans of mackral fish all the time.  I had never had a dog before, and didn't know that dogs should not be fed fish.  The biggest mistake of my life.  I was totally ignorant about the fact that I shouldn't have fed hin fish.  I wouldn't have thought that a vet would not like dogs.  To make a long story short, several years later he developed stomach cancer.  I took him to a different vet who told me that he would do his best for my dog.  But my dog died at onlly ten years old.  I was still in my teens, and devastated.  My mother said we could burry him in a pet cemetary.  He was put in a pretty casket with his head resting on a little pillow.  He was placed under a beautiful pepper tree.  That happened many years ago, but I still think about him, as well as other family members who have passed away.

I highly recommend Hachi, but keep the Kleenex close at hand.",1391904000,,1606,4.015873015873016

4053774,5,B0031RAOVY,"The original 1987 Japanese version was filled with many ironies and trajectories that seemed to focus more on Hachi's private struggles. In the beginning, after a long train journey in the winter in which he almost dies, from inside the small cage in which he is transported from the breeder to his new home, Hachi as a small 2 month old pup opens his eyes to the hands of the one who would eventually become his sole friend and loyal master. He is fated for yet another journey, a life-long journey filled with much struggle for survival, but again culminating in the hands of his master. Ironies surround the name chosen for him, Hachi, which in Japanese is the number 8 and one which signifies promise and good fortune, even divine favor. It also turns out that Hachi is the 5th of 5 Akita breds that his master has tried to raise. The first four did not survive 2 years, Hachi the 5th is the one that does. The twist is that though Hachi survives well beyond 2 years, his master does not which puts him on multiple trajectories of life-threatening struggle. Eventually abandoned to the streets, one thing keeps him focused in his long journey, his love for and loyalty to his master. His  9 yr search for his deceased master (which actually occurred in the true historical biography of Hachi) drives him into the hearts of a few compassionate people, but mostly into the ire of others. And this is how the original version played out, finally ending in Hachi's dramatic reunion with his master and release from this world with its hardships and betrayals. His loyalty is fulfilled.

This later American version is similar on some fronts but different on others: fewer ironies I believe. It focuses more on simplicity, family and community. The film's slow metabolism gravitates more towards Hachi's experience that we might understand and experience how he experienced events and relationships, such that in his simple black and white world salted with simple acts of giving and receiving, the simple truth and sincerity of those acts reveal themselves forming into lasting bonds of friendship, commitment and loyalty. These transactions  eventually extend into the larger community in his daily vigils at the town square so that something very uncommon begins to flow out of something that appears very common. The film achieves in depth what it lacks in surface.

To illustrate further, at his master's funeral service, words of Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass_Songs To Myself"" are read aloud by his university associate and friend Ken Fujiyoshi. Ken reads: ""  I hear and behold God in every object.........I find letters from God dropped in the street, .......And I leave them where they are for I know that others will punctually come forever and ever"". For purposes of this film, this might allude to the divine nature of the number 8 (Hachi) in Japanese culture, signifying something rising to and coming down from Heaven to earth,  but also to the notion that there is nothing `common', that all is commonly uncommon, that everything has impact from a solitary snow flake descending to earth upon heavenly currents and existing for not more than a moment to a pup that sees and hears in black and white.

As the trains themselves are currents in the daily life of the community, Hachi himself becomes a quiet but impactful undercurrent at the station....a memo to  the community about the importance of family, faith, friendship, relationships, commitment  and loyalty, vitals to the human spirit and social body. And this is where I believe the original Japanese film and the American version contrast. In this version, Hachi's life has more impact in the community. Today a monument to Hachi stands in his honor at the Shibuya station and is one of the most attended sites in Tokyo. The simple but grounded image of the faithful companion resides there an anachronism to the modern time-driven world encouraging pedestrians, viewers and visitors to be more attentive to relationships and things of the human spirit, past and future, with all of their perplexities and uncertainties. Whispers though they be become loud when finally acknowledged.

A brief summary of this film's final moments follows:

After 10 years, his mistress finally came to terms with her husband's death and returned to visit her daughter, son-in-law and grandson. It was at the end of the year, during the Christmas season, a time for giving. Before going to her family's home, while it was still daytime, she visited her former home, and then her husband's grave. From there she passed by the station where she found Hachiko waiting at his spot, now a much older version, weaker, heavier and in fading colors, but his loyalty never diminishing.  He looked tired, even sad, but recognized his mistress and welcomed her. His mistress, surprised, gave to him the affection she had withheld when they were together in those earlier years. In so doing, she was not only embracing Hachi, but also loving her husband. She stayed by his side for the next train after which she departed to her daughter's home. With their family reunited, the circle was now complete, the stage set.

Hachi would find Home that evening dying peacefully in his master's arms while faithfully waiting in the same place he had all these years. The sun had set, Christmas lights illumined the station, the air was crisp, and a light snow began to fall as it did 11 years earlier when he found his master. Hachi, having worked his way to the station for the evening arrival, laid at his spot at the front of the circle's edge ( a small circular island overlayed with flowers and a park bench at its center), hoping but with dimming vision. The station, except for a few people departing, appeared empty. Hachi, not finding his master among them fell asleep and began to dream: He saw a brightly lit Train arriving at the station while at the same time began re-living memories of some of his most cherished moments. He saw himself running and walking with his master as they enjoyed their companionship on paths to his home. It was in a warm and brightly lit world cognizant of no end. His master now disembarking the Train as he had always done emerged through the doors into Hachi's Heart where he faithfully gave himself one last time. The circle complete, Hachi found him as he did 11 years earlier, at the station in the colors of beginnings, without mystery. Lunging from himself into his master's arms he freely gave himself as a gift without age borne out of an uncommon bond of companionship, trust and loyalty. Hachi passed on separating quietly, peacefully and seamlessly where he lay. As the falling snow sank into his now still and hollow brow, the Train quietly departed with its lamps fading into the silent cold mists of the night.....

This is a very well acted film with a very good script, highly recommended for animal lovers and the sensitive of heart. This is not really a Richard Gere type of film but he demonstrated his versatility with an award level performance. Watch both the Japanese and American versions to compare and contrast.

4053829,5,B0031RAOVY,"This has got to be the absolute best movie about our little furry, four-legged friends that has ever been made. If you can sit through this without shedding a tear (especially in the final scenes, when Hachi is old) then you're tougher than I. I love dogs of all kinds, and this Akita, will grab at your heart strings for sure. I openly admit that I cried at the end and had trouble regaining my composure, especially when looking at our two little Yorkies. I have found dogs to be more loving, faithful, and better companions than most people. This movie is not rare, collectible, or expensive, and therefore readily available at a good price right here on Amazon. Pick this one up and have a family movie night. You won't regret it. Get the soundtrack too, while you're at it. Quite possibly one of the most beautiful instrumental scores ever written, for the piano. The movie would suffer greatly without it. Put this one in your CD player, sit back, and allow yourself to go to dreamland, and think about why people are so evil, violent, and uncaring and ""man's best friend"" is just the opposite in every respect.

We watched this via our Amazon Prime membership vs. the regular rental price of $3.99; Prime membership or not, you will get more than $3.99 worth of value out of this one.",1388361600,,529,4.1568627450980395

4053910,4,B0031RAOVY,"They limited it to the standard 90 minutes which may have led to some compromises. However, if you are a dog lover or understand what Semper Fi (delis) means, this one will get to you. The story is different and told from the dog's perspective at times. It is based on a true story that occurred in Japan though it was updated and changed for the American market so the audience here can better identify with the story.

It is best watched without reading any synopsis about the story itself including what the box might say!",1388102400,,525,4.46875
4053911,5,B0031RAOVY,"Wonderful movie based on a true story that actually took place in the 1920's in Japan about a college professor and his dog.  The movie was done present day here in the USA.  Richard Gere was wonderful in the part of the college professor.  I can't believe it didn't get more publicity than it did.  It was made in 2009 and I had never even heard of it until I saw it by chance at the grocery store in the DVD section.  This is a movie you can watch with the entire family, young and old.  Just make sure you have a box of Kleenex close by.  It is a bitter sweet movie about a dog and his master who loved each other so deeply.  A must see movie for dog lovers.  I'm 62 and I don't think I've ever had a movie touch me the way this one did.",1388016000,2,740,3.88
4053912,4,B0031RAOVY,"If you can appreciate that the true story this move, starring Richard Gere, Joan Allen and a beautiful Akita, was based on, occurred several decades ago, you will most likely be moved to tears by the film's conclusion.  The movie recounts the life of Hachi, a dog found by a college professor as a pup.  After trying unsuccessfully to find a home for the puppy, the professor (played by Gere) and Hachi, form a strong bond.  After the professor's unexpected death, Hachi refuses to stay home and returns to the train station where he had awaited his master's return from work each day.  For the following ten years until Hachi's death, street vendors in the area take pity on the animal and provide him with enough sustenance to survive.

Although it is unlikely that a dog could remain a stray in America for ten years in this day and age, the actual Hachi lived many decades ago in Japan.  If a viewer can take this into account, the story is actually quite moving.  Hachi's grief and confusion after his owner's death are palpable, and they highlight the dog's, as well as dogs' in general's,  loyalty.

I highly recommend the movie for all animal lovers.",1388016000,,1158,4.637254901960785

Funny how in our walk here in this incarnation both this story the movie came along when we rescued our Japanese Akita....however I hope people will not go for a real life Akita companion just because of this story.

You will cry, laugh out loud, it is just fantastic and it is based on a true story. Now I am prejudice because the puppy in the beginning of the movie is Hochiko, and he is the father of my pups born 11/2013. He is actually a Shiba Inu pup, and then they used an Akita for the adult dog.",1387843200,,575,3.8403361344537816

I have yet to meet a female Shiba owner who hasn't woken up in a cold sweat from the ""Shiba got away from me"" nightmare.  That said, to allow a dog of this breed to walk the streets, and then leave the house for good, was not only irresponsible but abhorrent.

Needless to say, I cried the entire movie - but I couldn't stop watching it.  I know from experience how devoted dogs are to their human friends - and to see such a poignant and moving story after having lost two of my own dogs, well, I guess it was therapy - though I was emotionally drained.

4054014,2,B0031RAOVY,"Being a dog lover I generally love movies like this. I was sure I'd enjoy it and had heard good things about it. Not only was the dog adorable, but it had good actors in Richard Gere and Joan Allen.

The movie started out very very good. The first hour was enjoyable, entertaining and at points, funny.

To me, that's when the movie stopped. Richard Gere died suddenly. The film then takes on a new perspective and that is of a grieving dog. It shows the dog, Hachi, going down to the train station day after day waiting for Richard Gere to return home. Heartbreaking indeed.

However, it goes on like this for TOO long. The last 30 minutes of this 90 minute film basically shows the dog sitting outside the train station.

The other part of the film that I did not like and where the film lost it' for me was toward the end. Richard Gere's daughter decides to take the dog. Then, soon after taking the dog in, she decides to let the dog loose, allowing it to spend the last 9 years of his life roaming the streets of a fairly heavily populated suburb.

One other scene which also blew it for me was when the dog, an Akita, which is a Japanese breed, is being talked to by a Japanese man. The man speaks to Hachi in Japanese and the translation on the bottom indicates that the dog, a Japanese breed, understands Japanese.

I really wanted to enjoy this movie and parts of it were very good. But overall, a let down.

4054044,5,B0031RAOVY,"I rate ""Hachi, A Dog's Tail"" one of the best movies ever made.

The film itself was beautiful, including the segments reflecting Hachi's view of things.  The setting (Woonsocket RI) was wonderful - I even stopped by to see the station when I was in the area in May.  The actors were very, very good.  They probably made the movie because they knew it was a great story, while recognizing that it would not be a blockbuster financially.  The message related to loyalty is extremely compelling. Finally, the music was outstanding.

While most people like Hachi, the movie has some critics that don't seem to understand a couple of the issues related to the story.

First, this is an Americanized version of something that actually happened in Japan.  Most cultures actually have stories of the eternally loyal dog, and these stories are based on fact.  They are inspirational. My point, though, is that since this is a true story, it had to be told pretty much as it happened.  Hachi actually did live life as what we'd call a stray, in Tokyo in the 1920's.

Second, as must have been the case certainlly with the true Hachi, our Hachi was in fact taken care of by the people who knew him in the area around the train station.  This was not a case of Hachi going it alone, digging through dumpsters for scraps to survive.  It is a tribute to the community, which was intensely loyal to Hachi.  It was reflected well in the sequence in which Jasjeet tells Ken that the people around the station would always take care of Hachi, even to taking up a collection for Hachi if he needed medical help.  This is hardly a story of some abandoned dog.  And, keep in mind that we're talking about an Akita, a big and hearty dog that's not going to freeze in a New England winter.

Third, I would have to agree that the adults in Parker's family were flawed, but that's consistent with what happened with the real Hachi, who was left in the care of Ueno's gardner.  In the movie, Kate pretty much fell apart after Parker's death.  Andy had so much going on in her life, and probably didn't know what to do for Hachi.  I wouldn't have turned Hachi loose, personaly, but I have a different perspective on my dogs.  Remember, this is pretty much what happened to the real Hachi, so that was the story.  These people weren't evil, they were flawed - as we all are in some way.

In conclusion, I believe this movie to be monumental in its significance as a life lesson.  It is beautifully made and inspirational.  If you're going to show it to pre-teen kids, it might be a good idea to pre-view it yourself, and talk with the kids about it before having them watch it.",1380067200,8,2649,4.457380457380458
4054045,5,B0031RAOVY,This is an adorable movie! But it's so sad! Shows the relationship someone can have with their dog and the loyalty a dog can have.,1380067200,,130,4.24
4054046,5,B0031RAOVY,I didn't cry when old yeller died. Hachi made me cry like an adolescent girl. Such an amazing and powerful story.  All dog owners must see this film.,1380067200,,149,4.321428571428571
4054047,1,B0031RAOVY,"I own dogs. I know the laws about domesticated animals, and if this story is true or based in true events, I can see that the cruelty of the characters involved has been diverted into a circus of sympathy full of hypocrisy.

This is a dog that appears to suffer of ADD, because was not capable to play catching a ball to be returned to the owner up to some years later. The only ""trick"" this dog was capable to learn was to go forth and back the train station following or waiting for his owner.

The story leans on the idea that people will trust the ""will of the dog"", this is to say, to do what the dog ""thinks is best"".

We see a dog (Hachi) that comes from another country and by chance the cage falls and brakes and the dog ""finds"" a person who will take care of this animal. So far, nobody (and this is important to remember) nobody wants to adopt the animal, neither the worker at the train station, the hot dog tender, and so forth. Finally, Mr. Parker (the person who found the lost puppy) adopted the dog.

This dog received lots of attention and love from Mr. Parker, and received treats from people who knew Mr Parker.

One day, Mr Parker died and the dog was taken by his survivor, the daughter, to a new house. Apparently the dog didn't receive love and proper care anymore, and the dog escaped to make the only ""trick"" learned: to wait for Mr. Parker at the train station.

The story continues with Mr. Parker's daughter leaving the dog free to go so the dog will never return back.

This action by the daughter is the beginning of the cruelty that was performed by the rest of characters in this story. Everybody was in the move to feel ""compassion"" for the dog waiting every day for Mr. Parker at the train station. These people did nothing to adopt the animal or to find someone to take care of Hachi. This dog became a ""street dog"" because the owner decided to get rid off this animal. Ten years passed by and this animal lived in the street suffering the changes of weather, living by the ""treats"" given by some people, and wasting life sitting or resting at the front of the train station waiting for Mr. Parker. Ten years, a street dog.

I have no idea about laws for pets, but surely Mr. Parker's daughter should have to pay a penalty for releasing the dog to the street instead of taking the dog to an animal shelter.

Hachi died ""like a dog"" in the street, old, dirty, alone, without love and care. Who pay to bury the dead dog? Perhaps the city? How in the world this city has built a monument to the dog, when the whole story is no more that animal cruelty after the death of Mr. Parker? I should investigate who were the owners of that dog and collect the charges for the burying of the dog, the cleaning of the dog's poo poo in the streets, and a huge penalty with years of interest for the illegal release the animal to the street.

If this story is true, shame on you, the woman who released the dog to the street, shame of you, the train station worker, the hot dog seller, shame of you, the city which built the monument... shame of you, all the participants in this story who did nothing to take care of this poor animal, you make me sick with your imagination that the dog was something special and that was capable to rule its own destiny by some mysterious fate.

A story that should be told, is the dog learning new tricks, playing with Mr. Parker's grandson, receiving attention and love in the new house. But what this story is about, is like to say that your father lost your mother, and instead of giving him love and care, you ""release"" your father to be a drunker, to wait for her at the bus stop for ten years, to forget shaving and taking showers, and to die miserably in the streets...

Is this how ""heroes"" died?

I know it was based on a true story & I remember reading about it in the news, but I believe it was carried too far and the film could have ended sooner.  The amount of years the dog yearned could have been displayed in the narrative at the end rather than subjecting animal lovers to the agony of Hachi's devotion.

They did a great job of modernizing the story, with contemporary settings, etc. The relationship between dog and owner portrayed well. However, I hoped to be inspired and awed.  Instead, I literally cried the whole second half of the movie.  The story portrays the dog as loyal to the utmost.  He went to the train station to wait on his master who had died every day for 10 years at 5 o'clock.  The family gave the dog chances to live with the owner's daughter and family, who he knew. Instead, he chose a lonely, desolate existence with minimal human contact.  I wouldn't call that loyal.  That's depression.",1379030400,,663,4.559322033898305

After discovering at the end that it was in fact a true story I loved it even more. The one star reviews are what made me want to actually review this film. It seems to me that if you think this movie is not appropriate for kids, or you think it was somehow cruel to animals, then you are cynical and delusional. How is loyalty, love and innocence not themes appropriate for kids? The dog dying is not tragic at all. Death is a part of life. Its how you die, tragically, violently, or heroically that makes the difference of whether or not its appropriate for kids. The dog did not want to forget his friend and never gave up hope that he would one day see him again. The people in this story were 'human' enough to recognize the greatness of that sentiment. Isn't this the kind of hope we teach our kids about in church, school, and fairy tales? Life is cruel sometimes, and that makes us forget or stop believing greater things. Its rare to see people make it into their old age and still possess this kind of faith. Haichi was faithful his whole life. I think it is fitting that Haichi was immortalized in bronze. He never forgot about his friend, even in death. That's something worth teaching our kids about for generations. One final thought, at the end, when haichi died, we see him reunited with his friend. Of coarse this did not happen in the physical realm, but if you don't believe in spirit or inspiration, then why do you care about the moral message and how it affects your kids at all? If you care, you'd serve them better by letting them watch the movie, have a little cry, and then explain to them about the message so that they understand why it is meaningful.",1377216000,,1783,4.309523809523809

I did not really see much going on for a while other than a very adorable puppy. I watched this movie with my cat and by mid movie all I wanted to do is hug my cats and show them how much I love them for being so unconditional to me. It a timeless and very simple story and all can watch and learn from. Some basic human emotions that trancends to animals alike. It hard to keep it together toward the end as the story concentrates on the dog. I was speechless towards the end and could not stop sobbing. The kind of film that will stick with you and learn to appreciate the power of love and loyalty no matter whom or where it comes from.

4054196,5,B0031RAOVY,Watch a trailer before watching the movie so you know what you know about the tears you will be shedding from this. Great movie with wonderful acting.

4054203,1,B0031RAOVY,"I am a huge animal lover, but this movie was so freaking slow and pointless that I stopped watching part way through to check some of the 1-star reviews to decide whether to bother finishing it. Turns out the movie is nothing more than a one-dimensional (and extremely fictionalized) dramatization of a 30-second true anecdote, dragged out excruciatingly in order to make it long enough to sell as a movie. Here comes a spoiler, but if I were you I would read it anyway and save yourself an hour & a half out of your life: a guy adopts a dog that he found; the dog waits every evening at the train station for the guy to get home from work; one day the guy dies, but the dog continues to wait for him for years, living out in the elements the entire time. The end. If you are a parent of small children, run screaming from this film because even though it is rated G, it features extended, traumatic scenes of a dog being neglected and suffering. BTW If I were a parent, I would also not want my kids to watch a movie that glorifies and renders ""heartwarming"" the incredibly cruel and irresponsible behavior of most of the adults in it.",1372118400,17,1136,4.338028169014085

4054214,5,B0031RAOVY,Richard Gere plays a tender and hear twarming part. The fact that it is a true story makes it more unbelieveable. This movie shows the true attachment between people and their pets. Not a dry eye at the end.,1371686400,,207,4.333333333333333
4054215,4,B0031RAOVY,The tie that develops between a grown man and a wee pup grows stronger all the time.  RIchard Gere is hilarious as the custodian of the dog when he tries to teach it to fetch.  His portrayal of love for the animal as it grows is moving.  The story could be compared and contrasted to Lassie Come Home.  Both are joyful and both are tearjerkers in the loveliest way.  Lassie loves a boy; Hachi loves a grown man.  Both have that love returned.,1371686400,,442,4.265060240963855
4054216,5,B0031RAOVY,"I was surprised to read that the producers of this movie did not give it an initial U.S. release, but chose to release it in foreign markets. Apparently they thought that it was too sad to be a hit in the American market. It's a shame that they would take such a short-sighted commercial view of this film, for it offers a powerful  message on the meaning of love and loyalty. An important film, one that will stay with you for a long time.

I thought it a nice touch that the producers tied in the original true story that happened in Japan with this American version. That Hachi is sent as a puppy from Japan and is lost at an American train station and found by the Richard Gere  character (or does the dog find him?), a college professor. That one of his friends at his college is a Japanese man who fills him in on the background and character of the breed. I thought one of the most affecting scenes was where this man speaks to Hachi in Japanese at the train station many years later as he still patiently awaits the return of his master and tells him how he understands his loyalty and devotion and respects him for it.

I want to add that it's a perfect family movie: no violence, sex, or profanity--just a wonderful tale of love and devotion. There is sadness and loss to it. But sadness and loss are an inevitable part of life, and that is an important message to learn. But the overriding message is one of enduring love, and that is the more important message.",1371600000,2,1473,4.326086956521739

4054218,3,B0031RAOVY,"Hachi - A dog's tale was a sweet film.  Certainly appropriate for the family.  I liked it and yet there were holes in the story that bothered me to the point that I would limit my stars to 3 instead of 4.
How the dog came to it's owner (Richard Gere) was a little sketchy, perhaps it was suppose to be.  The devotion of dog & master was lovely and yet I had problems with the wife's attitude through the entire film.
I found out at the end that this was fashioned after a real life dog and series of events and sincerely wish that the writers had chosen a storyline a little closer to the truth and hadn't tried so hard to ""Hollywood"" it up.
Still in all it was a pleasant passing of 2 hours with a few sniffles thrown in for good measure.",1371340800,,739,4.0479452054794525

4054224,5,B0031RAOVY,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie on television, so the order was for a gift for my sister. It was a totally ""dog centered"" story, showing the perspective, quite often, from Hachi's perspective. Photographing upwards when he was lying down, for instance, using muted color, showing his singlemindedness as he stood waiting for his master's return on the bus each day. Good family movie, with or without the kids around. Hard to find such a quality of movie nowadays.",1371168000,,471,4.827160493827161

4054226,5,B0031RAOVY,I love this movie. It really shows people how in tune our pets are to us. I don't think dogs get enough credit for what they do for us and how they really do understand us. They love us unconditionally. Richard Gere plays an excellent roll and of course the main actor Hachi is excellent. I recommend this to everyone of every age. It will teach you things you may have never known about our furry kids and how they will go out on a limb for us. How strong of a love they have for us. The writers of this movie really did an excellent job.,1371081600,,539,4.046728971962617

4054276,5,B0031RAOVY,A must see for animal lovers. A beautiful true story that shows animals can love deeply and remain more loyal than humans. I loved it from the first moment. You might need a tissue if your sensitive. I did.,1368835200,,206,4.3076923076923075
4054277,5,B0031RAOVY,"Last night I wanted to take a break in my movie watching. Too many of my movies of late have been crime stories, action movies, war stories, and things of that sort. Murder, mayhem, gunfire, explosions and  foul language seem to dominate. I have nothing against this type of entertainment, in fact, I njoy it. However I needed a break. I found ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" on a five-dollar DVD rack and bought it. The movie was rated G and I only seldom watch G-rated movies.

Okay, this is a really  simple dog story that originated in Japan in the 30s and was brought and adapted to the US. It might be simple, but keep your hanky within reach. An Akita puppy was sent to a railway station, probably in New England,  the shipping crate was broken and the small dog wandered about the station until discovered by a professor (Richard Gere). It was late and Gere tried to fix things but couldn't so he  took the dog home on a temporary basis. The next day he continued to try and rid himself of the puppy, but you all can probably guess what happened. He ended up adopting the beautiful little dog.

Well, the first half of the movie consists of the lost dog, the finding of the dog and the adoption and the gradual assimilation of the dog (Hachi) into the lives of Gere, his wife (Joan Allen) and their family. Not much excitement. The man and dog bond became stronger and stronger. To best understand and enjoy the story, it would probably be best if you had such a bond at some time in your life, but that isn't necessary. At about the mid-point in the movie, Gere suddenly died in his classroom. From there on Hachi is the leading actor. It's a simple story of deep love and devotion, and remember, keep that box of tissues handy.

This is a really simple, really well done film that packs an emotional wallop second to none. I'm amazed it hasn't gathered more attention. It's the best  dog story I've ever watched.

As for the movie, it is delightful and so is Richard Gere. I thought that it dragged a bit as Hachi aged but how do you cover 9 years of waiting without it being a little boring, especially since the dialogue during this time is limited.

4054318,5,B0031RAOVY,"the real history happened in japan and the original movie is Japanese. For those doesn't so into foreign old movie which can be a little less production and dynamism may like this one better.
The characters played in the movie also has different personality them the ones played in the original japanese movie.
To know the history of what really happen you need to research the internet. But there is tons of stories of loyal dogs in the world. Like in Argentina (I guess it was there) where the most recent history I read about a dog that completed 6 years at the cemetery where the owner was buried. Some of the employees of the cemetery gives food and water to the dog while he is waiting for his owner.
If you a animal lover and like to see stories about animals no matter the way it was produced you will love this one and cry.
In fact a pure breed akita is very rare to be found an there is few in the world. There is also a little war between Japan and US where each one has their akita breed. But if it's a real akita, this dog remain loyal to one person in the familiy and like the movie the dog personality isn't festive like several other dogs. They are more reserved and bark very very few, so don't expect benji or lessie coming out of the screen in this movie",1366588800,,1273,4.221311475409836

1996-2008, it portrayed. The first part of the movie which portrays the dog's early years is appropriate but after the Gere character dies the dog is released into the streets to live the last ten years isof his life in a densely populated area. This is not realistic in today's society. We know from an early scene when Haichi was a pup the local shelter euthanizes strays after 2 weeks if not adopted. The Gere character was great but after that it is ridiculous to think that in today's society Haichi would havr survived that long in an era of leash laws and pooper scooper laws. Awesome dog, stupid people, and a very sad touching movie based on a true story.",1366588800,5,811,4.449664429530201
4054320,5,B0031RAOVY,"The movie can be summed up in one comment from the movie: ""You don't chose the dog.  The dog chooses you."" I would alter that slightly with the addition ""and you will be won over.""  I don't expect this happens a lot partly because of the much shorter life of the dog than the human, but a one owner dog can get very emotional for the external observers.  When the chemistry between owner and dog flows well the bonding is very impressive and provides warm yearnings on how life should be.

I was surprised at how fast it arrived with the group of DVDs ordered, but I decided to watch it at the end - saving the best for last.  I was not disappointed.",1366502400,,650,4.209677419354839

All literary license (time, locale, among some points) and pathetic fallacy aside, as well as some rather inane, irritating actions on the part of some of the human characters, this film beautifully and greatly underscores the special bond of love and devotion which uniquely exist between dog and human. The film will certainly tear at the heartstrings of most dog lovers everywhere if not anger and frustrate them and perhaps turn them off to the film itself.

4054344,5,B0031RAOVY,"Philosopher, Josiah Royce, for whom Royce Hall at UCLA is named, opined that loyalty was the highest of all human qualities because it often required the individual or group to act against their own self-interest.  Well, HACHI demonstrates that that quality is not unique with humans.  The loyalty of HACHI would move even the most hardened and cynical person and the film is both beautiful and moving.  I not only recommend this film but I also send videos of it to friends as an educational and inspiring gift.  Will Carter",1365724800,,525,4.8

He always follows him to the station & then comes back at 5:00 to meet him. I won't give away anything else cause you really have to see it. IT's based on a true story.

4054364,5,B0031RAOVY,"This is a beautiful true story. I actually heard of it when I was 14. I'm 26 now. I greatly fell in love with the story and since then always wanted an Akita. I have never seen this movie but I love animals and greatly enjoy animal movies, and the reviews were positive so I bought. Within seven minutes into this movie I already was crying. By the time this movie was over I was a complete mess. I have never cried this much ever. I am not an emotional person so this movie got to me. The last seven minutes of the movie, my cat Logan, (who never likes to cuddle or be smothered with love, unless its on his own terms), actually let me hold his paw and cry the entire time. This movie is so powerful. You need to have a box of kleenex on hand because this movie is incredibly powerful. It breaks your heart how he stays there waiting. My dad has an outdoor cat in his neighborhood that everyone lends a hand and takes care of, feeding him, letting him stay inside their house, etc, but he will never just stay in one place or be an inside cat. He wants out. So I can understand Hachi needing to  leave his home and be there waiting at the train station. Even Richard Gere stated that when he read the script he kept crying and was a mess. If you love animals dearly and enjoy the unconditional love they give you, watch this movie. I'm so glad I have this movie in my collection.",1364083200,,1380,4.130111524163569

4054387,2,B0031RAOVY,"Apart from being a true story about a loyal Akita, this American version does not depict the real life of Hachiko in 1920 Japan. It leaves you wondering why the owner's family, commuters and strangers were so indifferent to this dog. For those of you who are incensed as I was about the lack of compassion shown to this dog, here's a summary by Monika Zoltany of what really happened to Hachi. WARNING! Do not read if you haven't seen the movie yet.

""In January 1924 a professor at the Japanese Imperial University brought home a two-month old Akita puppy. Dr. Ueno named the pup Hachiko.

The following year was a wonderful time for Hachiko and his new master. Akitas are large dogs, and Hachiko grew to be over ninety pounds. This beautiful white dog accompanied Dr. Ueno to the Shibuya train station every morning, where Dr. Ueno would say goodbye to Hachiko and head to the university. And every day when Dr. Ueno returned home Hachiko would be waiting for him at the train station and the two would go home together. Anyone could see the powerful bond between the large Akita and his master.

If things had continued like this, the story would still be one of admirable faithfulness from a dog to its master. But that was not the fate of Dr. Ueno and his loyal Akita Hachiko.

May 21, 1925 was like any other day for the pair. In the morning, Professor Ueno left Hachiko at Shibuya Station. But when Hachiko returned to Shibuya Station in the evening, his master was nowhere to be found. Though Hachiko waited, Dr. Ueno never showed up.

Dr. Ueno had died from a stroke earlier that day.

Akitas are very loyal dogs and do not bond easily with new people. Hachiko was sent away to another area of Japan where there were relatives of Dr. Ueno's who could take care of him. Because Hachiko had only belonged to Dr. Ueno for a little over a year, they probably hoped that the Akita would make a new family with them. But Hachiko didn't care. He ran away from the family and returned to the train station to wait for his master. The family realized that they couldn't keep the big Akita dog from heading to Shibuya Station everyday, so they gave Hachiko to Dr. Ueno's old gardener who still lived in the area.

Every evening Hachiko would return to Shibuya Station and wait for Dr. Ueno to get off the six-o'clock train. And every day, Hachiko was disappointed. Still, he never missed a day of hoping that his master would return to him.

The commuters noticed the Akita waiting every day at the station. Some of them had known the pair when Dr. Ueno was still alive, and everyone who heard of Hachiko's story was touched. People petted him and gave him food. Months passed, then years. Still Hachiko kept his vigil. A newspaper heard of the dog's story and Hachiko became a Japanese celebrity. To commemorate his loyalty, a statue of the Akita was erected at Shibuya station. Hachiko was even present at the ceremony!

Despite the people's loving intentions, Hachiko basically lived as a stray. He would call no place home except where Dr. Ueno was, and since Dr. Ueno was nowhere, Hachiko had no home. He lived on the street, fought other dogs, and ate scraps and handouts. Hachiko got sick with worms and mange, but because so many people admired him he was given treatment by a veterinarian. Hachiko became an old, scarred dog, with one ear up and one ear down, and no longer looked like the purebred Akita that he was.

It was March, 1935 when Hachiko finally died. The old Akita was found in a Shibuya street. He had waited for his master for almost ten years. Many people were saddened by Hachiko's death, but others say that he was finally at peace and could go with his master wherever it is we go when we die. Hachiko's story of loyalty touched the hearts of many people all over the world. In Japan, his statue at Shibuya Station is still a popular meeting place. There is even a ceremony to remember Hachiko every year on April 8. A Japanese movie, Hachiko Monogatari, was made in 1987 and was considered a smash-hit.""

I don't understand why the film makers found it necessary to depict an 'American' family so devoid of love and compassion toward their family dog. They probably meant to create more drama, but it had the opposite effect on me. It upset me to no end but I feel much better now that I know the whole story.

Also, there's a very important detail the film makers missed: In today's America, it's inconceivable that a special dog like Hachi would've gone unnoticed while running around loose in the streets for 10 years (leash laws would prohibit it in most cities anyway). I bet there would've been national reports about his remarkable story and many good Samaritans would've been on a long waiting list to adopt him. That's just the way we are.",1363046400,7,4777,4.548311990686845

4054415,1,B0031RAOVY,"This movie while well made and well acted will leave you feeling numb and depressed if you have any love of animals. Based upon a true story, it is both heart-wrenching and absorbing. Yes, there is a bond between Richard Gere's character and Hachi and his love for the dog is genuine. But overshadowing this bond is the inhumanity of the wife, daughter and son-in-law, he leaves behind after death. To watch that poor dog deteriorate while all the while waiting for his master to return (which can never happen) is very sad. And for the family to allow this to happen is beyond my ability to comprehend. Now, some will say that it was the dog's wishes to wait for his master. But a dog has no understanding of the death of his master. That dog should have been taken in and cared for by someone, anyone and I kept hoping that a kind heated person would intervene. When a stray cat gave birth under my shed, I took the kittens and saw that they got good homes. The mother cat looked for them and it was obvious that she wanted them to live their lives with her as strays. But a cat, like a dog such a Hachi can not be expected to understand the nature of life. Even humans fail to do so at times. It saddened me to have to take the kittens away.  But it would have saddened me more if I found them mauled by a roving dog or hit by a car. What I am trying to say is that an animal needs human guidance and respecting Hachi's wishes to sit by a train station for someone who will never arrive for many years is irresponsible at best. This movie should not be seen by children and frnkly despite the acting, I regret having viewed it.",1361577600,15,1630,4.207667731629393

I expected it would be either a tear jerker or a heart warming movie from the opening...  The origin of the puppy Hachi, to his mishap which led to Richard finding him, to the boy at school giving a report on his hero, a dog named Hachi.

I think only a dog lover can truly appreciate this movie.  Our standard poodle has brought so much love into our lives, and that experience has made this movie even more real.

I found out later that the movie is based on a true story.  The history is beautiful. The intelligence in Hachi is an wonderful example of the unique nature of dogs.

4054451,1,B0031RAOVY,"When I heard there was a DVD to be released about the famous Japanese dog Hachiko, I was elated!  I had always heard about the tale of Chuken Hachiko (""faithful Hachiko"") as a child from my mother, essentially a Japanese version of the Scottish Greyfriars Bobby.  I eagerly bought the DVD and planned to have this as a cherished dog film for my collection.  (Spoilers ahead.)

My husband and I sat down to watch, eager to see a heart-warming tale.  At first, we were aghast when Hachi was forced to sleep in a shed outside the family home!  No cushion for a bed, no dog sleeping indoors by the hearth.  So much for showing the family dog affection.  After the professor dies, loyal Hachi keeps waiting at the train statiOn for him to return home.  When the dog is finally found by the professor's wife, if I recall, I was hoping she would take him home and keep him in a secure home or yard.  And then she leaves him to run loose as a stray!  Not even an attempt to bring him home!  The final straw for me was with the professor's son and daughter-in-law, who really did not care about the dog. (Or was it a daughter and son-in-law?  The film was not memorable for me.  I chose to forget.)

Maybe this was the true story of Hachiko, and his family who let him run loose as a stray dog, only to die in streets of cancer and worms, but I was looking for (because of the contemporary American setting and cast) a modern take on a loyal dog.  I wanted some revisionism and a happy, bittersweet ending.

This film was really a missed opportunity to show just how to love and care for a dog.  Hachi's love and loyalty were repaid with neglect and abandonment.

After watching this film, I was thoroughly disturbed and disgusted as a dog lover.  It was not about Hachi, but about his self-absorbed family who really didn't care about him.",1360108800,12,1831,4.3609467455621305

Although we all can learn a valuable lesson about dog ownership, I think the possibilities for a child who watches this movie are endless. I would recommend this movie to everyone and know I will watch it again and again.

The movie also includes a statement that Akita dogs may not be for everyone which is extremely important for all viewers and people who are considering including a dog to their family. I commend those who made the film for this inclusion.",1359676800,,735,4.5606060606060606

4054465,4,B0031RAOVY,"This is a heart warming and yet heart wrentching movie. I cried through the last 25 min. It is a great story about true loyalty, but very sad towards the end. Caution, there are a few scenes of social drinking, and it tends to lead to the idea that everyone goes to heaven, or at least to an eternal existence as wandering spirits. It also shows how ""people like to take credit for things they had nothing to do with"" once someone is gone from this life.",1359590400,,454,4.2298850574712645
4054466,5,B0031RAOVY,"With over 500 reviews on this movie, I can't add much.  No spoilers here, but most people browsing these reviews will probably have at least some idea of the general plot. It's a powerful movie. I knew the whole story in advance and still was moved (I mean I knew the real story, not the screen adaptation, and for the most part wasn't really surprised... but it made an impact nonetheless).  As some of the negative reviews have mentioned, there are a few plot elements that aren't very believable, but the screenplay writers should get some slack in that regard--they were trying to stick somewhat close to the original series of events.  I thought the first part of the movie would drag along, but it moved fairly quickly and kept me engaged.  There's enough at the beginning to see that Hachi and the Richard Gere character form a close bond.  Interestingly, at the beginning I felt there wasn't really a lot of character development with the dog, but that started to change as the movie progressed.  The dog really is the central character in the movie, as is probably obvious from the title and relative prominence given to beast vs. human(s) on the DVD cover.

I do disagree with the one-star reviewers who say the movie depicts gross animal cruelty--I can imagine something close to this happening, especially if the dog was fairly aloof, as this one seemed to be, except for his master.  The peripheral human characters in the film aren't cruel toward Hachi, even if they don't meet all of his potential needs or wants.

Take seriously the admonition to have tissues on hand and consider the potential impact on anyone you might watch it with or give it to.  Some may not want to watch something like this.",1359504000,,1715,4.667774086378738

I thought this was going to be an emotional roller coaster but it was sort of bland. It's a beautifully touching true story but I feel like it as just mssing something. They didn't develop the dog's personality like they could have I feel. He sort of just came off as a normal dog... a lug that ppl sort of resented... but not in the cute way like Chance from Homeward Bound... this was in the sort of dog lacking some personality way.

I DID RESEARCH ON THIS TRUE STORY AND FOUND THIS ARTICLE WRITTEN ABOUT HACHIKO.

Hachiko, Japanfs most famous dog
Instead of listening to the daily news about how much money stole this or that CEO, how many people were killed in last nightfs bomb blast in West Bank, how much the taxes will go up, why donft we take a breath and talk about something thatfs not all that interesting for the media!

In Tokyofs Shibuya ward (gBitter Valleyh in English), specifically in the area called Dogenzaka, right by the busiest intersection on the planet where every 3 minutes hundreds of people cross the street, stands a statue of the most famous dog in Japan, but virtually unknown in other parts of the world. The always busy area around this statue today serves as a meeting point that basically every Tokyoite knows about. Itfs well known that the Japanese love their pets, but what did this dog named Hachiko do to get his own statue right here?

The true story of Hachiko

Letfs roll back 86 years. Hachiko ((n`&ouml;), white male dog of Akita breed, was born in 1923 on a farm near the city of Odate in Akita prefecture on the north of Honshu. Nearly a year later he was brought to Tokyo by his owner, Hidesaburo Ueno, a professor of agriculture at the University of Tokyo

Every morning when Ueno went to work, Hachiko (also called Hachi) saw him off at the front door and waited for him in late afternoon on the same spot at the nearby Shibuya Station. This has become their daily routine. The tragedy occured in May of 1925 when Hachiko was eighteen months old. That day the professor didnft arrive by train as usual. At the university he suffered a stroke. He died and never came back to the station where his friend was waiting for him.

After Uenofs death, Hachiko was given away to new owners but he escaped every time, returning to his old home where he used to live with his master. When Hachiko eventually realized that the professor didnft live there anymore, he went back to the station. After that day, every time exactly at 4 ofclock when the train arrived, Hachiko came to wait in hopes of seeing his master.

This continued day after day, month after month, for the next 10 years. Many people who passed through the station every day, even brought food for Hachiko as he waited. He drew attention of one of former Uenofs students who followed the dog home and learned about his story from the new owners. The student was fascinated with the story and afterwards visited Hachiko many times as he began to write articles about him and the Akita breed.

In 1933, after one of his articles was published in Asahi Shinbun, Japanfs biggest newspaper, the dog became a national sensation. Teachers and parents around the country used Hachikofs loyalty as an example for children to follow. Eventually, Hachiko became national symbol of loyalty. His bronze statue was erected in front of the station and Hachiko himself was present at the opening ceremony. Unfortunately, during World War II the statue was melted down for war efforts. In 1948, Takeshi Ando, son of the original artist, was commissioned to create the second statue.

Hachiko was found dead on March 8, 1935 on a street in Shibuya. He died because of heart infection, and 3 or 4 yakitori sticks were found in his stomach (yakitori is fried chicken meat on a stick). Hachikofs stuffed and mounted remains can be seen in the National Science Museum in Ueno Park in Tokyo. Today, the dogfs statue still stands in front of the Shibuya Station, waiting and hoping that his master will come home.

This morning I went down to Shibuya to take some photos of the statue and the surroundings:",1356566400,,3895,4.630434782608695

4054550,4,B0031RAOVY,"It's not too often these days in which you get a feature film on an animal that hasn't been personified.

I really liked the genuine acting and the subtle nature of how the dog fits the film. It's obvious that Hachi is the centerpiece, but not annoyingly so. I do wonder if these dogs are all that dedicated to their master.

I'm not fond of crying as much as I did (which Disney does too often) and it was a bit of a thin script too. Then again, I'm not sure how it could be made better though as it is a simple story which doesn't need to be overdone.",1355875200,,553,4.0181818181818185

Despite his wife's feelings the the puppy is brought into the family and grows to be a more than loving companion. as Gere and the dogs bond grows a beautiful friendship unfolds embodingthe true spirit of family and everlasting loyality while inspirig the hearts of the whole town.

4054611,3,B0031RAOVY,"Director Lasse Hallstom (""Cider House Rules"") recreates a 1987 Japanese film (""Hachiko Monogatari"") which was based on a true story from the late 1920's.  Richard Gere stars as Parker Wilson, a middle aged college music professor.  He lives in a bucolic small town in what appears to be New England and commutes on the train to work.  One day he arrives home to find an Akita puppy wondering the train station platform.  He takes the dog home and tries to find the owner but alas no luck. With the reluctant approval of his wife (Joan Allen), he adopts the dog.

From this point, it's just a matter of time to determine what unfortunate fate will strike the dog (Hachi) or the Wilson family.  And since this is really a movie about a man and his dog's love and loyalty, the ""G"" rating should give away the answer.  Yes there is a goodly amount of sentimentality but not enough to make the movie overly schmaltzy.  Ultimately it has a good story, some decent acting and is heartwarming and modest enough for the entire family.

The Blu ray version of this film is just fine.  Shot on video, it comes with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  Although not of demo quality, it was always accurate and clear.  The  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack likewise is perfectly fine.  Most of the action is up front and the dialog is clear and distinctive.  Aside from the usual trailers the special features only consist of a ""making of"" feature.",1351468800,,1447,4.575875486381323

4054621,5,B0031RAOVY,"Well I definitely shed a few tears at this movie.  Ok, maybe more than a few, but give me a break, it's a touching story about a dog.  Who wouldn't cry?  And even better, it's loosely based on a true story.

When Parker finds a puppy on his way home from the train station, he doesn't intend to keep it.  But when no owner turns up, and he develops an attachment for the Akita dog, he adopts himself a pet.  Hachi is very close to Parker and as he grows he begins finding ways to see him off and meet him at the train station everyday for Parker's commute.  But Hachi's loyalty is put to the test when one day, Parker doesn't come off the train.

Characters:
Hachi: Played by Chico, Layla and Forrest
Richard Gere: Parker Wilson
Joan Allen: Cate Wilson
Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa: Ken Fujiyoshi
Sarah Roemer: Andy Wilson
Jason Alexander: Carl Boilins
Erick Avari: Jasjeet

I think each person (and dog) was picked appropriately for their role.  The dogs were all marvelously trained and wonderfully cute, and I could feel the stirring and want for a dog as a result.  Alas, I would only adopt an adult dog rather than buy a puppy because of how I feel about rescues, but they were undeniably cute and my cats would never forgive me anyway.  So no dog for now.  Richard Gere as Parker was also very good and I could really identify with him and his love for Hachi.  They shared a very close bond and you couldn't really tell it was a movie relationship instead of a real one.  The other characters don't feature as much, but I did really like Jasjeet and his concern and care for Hachi.  A very redeeming person and he was played well by Avari.

There isn't a lot of action in this film.  No intrigue, suspense, etc.  It was a story of loyalty and that's all that was needed.  Simply seeing Hachi's life was enough.  And they even filmed it as though some of it was through his eyes without trying to make it seem from a human's perspective.  It was just Hachi, as a dog, seeing what he was seeing and reacting to it.  And I liked that.  But I also liked the family and their interaction with Hachi, and Parker's devotion to him.  The fact that I used up half a box of tissues isn't even a problem.  If a movie is good enough to make me cry then there is no way I'm not going to adore it.  That being said, if you can't handle hard topics, you may not want to watch this movie.  But any animal lover will be able to understand and relate to it.

As said before, this movie is sometimes shot from Hachi's view, which is interesting.  It's not quite black and white, but there is an absence of color but it seems realistic.  Not that I know what a dog sees, but this could definitely be plausible.  The rest is standard filming and it wasn't too shaky or anything, it was just there to capture the film.  And the music was also in the background.  Parker was a professor of music, but it's mostly light calming music and it fits into the background to set a backdrop, not to be the main focus.

Fantastic movie that really captured the life of a wonderful dog.  Even though it was only loosely based on a real story, the themes of loyalty and love are well presented.

My seven-year-old sobbed and sobbed for about the last 40 minutes of the movie. After his beloved owner dies (Richard Gere), the dog Hachi is grief-stricken and for the rest of his life waits at the train station for the master who will never return. It was heartbreaking. I have no interest in watching this movie again and regret that I bought it and showed it to my daughter.  I'm surprised it was rated G.",1350086400,27,536,4.414141414141414

His wife is not a dog person so he doesn't know how to convince her but eventually...

What really moved me about this film the most was - how complicated we make our lives and how much happiness can be derived from the simplest and noble most of things. This film is about a small community of regular people who care about one another despite being disconnected. Living in the city one tends to cherish little things like being part of such a system of community, unobtrusive and friendly.

4054639,4,B0031RAOVY,"Great movie all around! Based on a true story.

The acting is fantastic...as far as the dogs are concerned. I cannot imagine what took to have the dogs play the role of Hachi and go through all the emotions. Some of the work is explained in the extras. Make sure you watch the extras AFTER you watch the movie. Richard Gere is OK but because of his previous roles and his usual mediocre acting (when was the last time that Richard Gere got an award for his acting?) it is hard to imagine him in this role of a dog lover/owner who suddenly carries a ball in his mouth to teach the dog how to fetch. And of course he is a music teacher, not a stock broker from New Jersey or an agricultural scientist like the real owner of Hachi. That is the reason for the four stars. Bruce Willis, Bobby DeNiro or Chuck Norris would be a more credible choice for this type of movie. Especially since it doesn't require much acting since the principal character of the movie is Hachi (the dog). The real Hachi died in 1935 in Japan and his owner, who died from a hemorrhagic stroke in 1925 while lecturing, was an agricultural scientist (not a ...music teacher) at the Imperial University in Tokyo. But of course for a Swedish liberal director/producer who directed all promotional films for the group ABBA, a music teacher is better, more classy(?), and doesn't have dirt on his hands. And of course he is playing the piano! That is exactly why Richard Gere was a poor choice. Don't you hate when liberal directors (mostly from Hollywood) take the freedom to change a true story? This is NOT fiction people, it should be left as is!

Simple story, very complicated emotions. A professor adopts a puppy in spite of the complaining of his wife (I think his wife is not represented well by Joan Allen who is quite cold and emotionless throughout the movie). It happens to be a very smart dog that has a huge bonding with his owner and waits for him every day at the train station. When the owner dies suddenly, it keeps coming back at the train station every day for nine years to wait for him. The last third part of the movie (the better part of the movie less people more Hachi) follows the dog's life after the owner dies.

Very well done and you will definitely get emotional because of the behavior of Hachi. As a dog lover/owner myself I can tell you that a dog is by far worth any human friend you can have. If you like Richard Gere you will give it five stars if not, don't worry the dogs are making up for the bad choice of the supporting cast.",1347148800,,2535,4.355179704016913

That being said, I believe that such people and even people like me will consider the time spent watching ""Hachi (A dog's tale)"" well worth the effort.
""Hachi"" is an Americanized version of the true story about a remarkable dog that once lived in Japan. Besides the dog, the movie stars Richard Gere and Joan Allen.  It is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who also directed ""Cider House Rules"".
Hachi is abandoned on a commuter train when just a pup.  The character portrayed by Richard Gere takes it home with him.  Predictably, a stong bond of mutual admiration, respect, and love gradually forms between the two; much to the dismay of the man's wife (Joan Allen), at least initially.
Hachi eventually endears himself to the entire family, extended family, and a large portion of the town's population; not because the dog exhibits unbelievable skills or talent, which it doesn't, but because it possesses and displays innate qualities of pride, independence, loyality, and determination that would put those of most humans to shame.  The casual viewer will soon find himself emotionally involved in and truly admiring of this dog's life.  Warning: The dog dies at the end.  I do not consider this a spoiler, since we all die at the end.

4054652,4,B0031RAOVY,"If you're as nuts over dogs as I am, Lasse Hallstrom's ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is a must-see. Be sure, however, that you've stocked up on Kleenex in advance.

""Hachi"" is based on a true story that is known to every Japanese schoolchild. Transposed to modern-day New England, it is the story of an Akita puppy, lost in transit from Japan to a new owner in America, who is found and rescued in a train station by a music professor (Richard Gere). Over the initial opposition of the professor's wife (Joan Allen), Hachi moves into the professor's home, and he and the professor become inseparable. Hachi accompanies the professor as he walks to the station to catch the train to work, and is always there to greet him when he returns home.

The mostly expository first hour of ""Hachi"" is pleasant enough but slightly dull, except for the sequences in which the action is shown through Hachi's eyes. Frankly, I don't find Richard Gere a terribly interesting actor when he's not playing a viilain or a con man, and here, of course, he's a sweetheart. But that doesn't matter in the end, because ""Hachi"" really is the dog's tale, and Hachi--or, more to the point, the various Akitas who play Hachi as a puppy, an adult dog, and finally an old dog--is the true star. Furthermore, the first hour is vital to setting up the final half-hour, when the story--now fully focused on Hachi--achieves sublimity. If you're a firm believer in the love and loyalty of dogs--or even if you aren't--the last half-hour of ""Hachi"" will move you to the core of your being.

I only hope ""Hachi"" doesn't motivate novice or unprepared dog owners to buy an Akita. If the ""making-of"" documentary on this DVD doesn't give you the hint, every book and TV program on Akitas will: Akitas are proud, stubborn, fiercely loyal dogs that regard anyone outside the immediate family as an interloper. Having an Akita in your house is like having a samurai in your house, and I mean a samurai who is half-wolf. But the Akitas in ""Hachi"" are magnficent dogs by any standard. If you have the guts to train an Akita, you will make by far the best friend you will ever have.",1342310400,,2128,4.594736842105263

4054657,5,B0031RAOVY,"The review before this one is obviously written by someone who doesn't appreciate true storytelling nor the impact of raw emotion and admiration for an animal. Just because a movie makes you emotional does NOT make it a movie not worth seeing. Nowhere on the Amazon description of this film does it say it's a happy-go-lucky film with a fairytale ending. It's powerful and likely to bring you to tears. That's exactly what it did. If a movie brings you to tears, then it's obviously done its job flawlessly. You cannot fault a film for its ability to draw raw emotion out into the open. There's nothing wrong with watching the usual ""aliens try to blow up the world"" action films with paper thin plot development either. They're fun, they're simple, you have a good time watching them. That doesn't make them better or more worthy of your attention than a movie like Hachi.

I've been a pet owner for nearly 30 years and no such movie has made even a guy like myself cry as much as I did when I watched the end of Hachi. Richard Gere plays an incredible role in this film and I really couldn't have imagined anyone more perfect for the part. As one other reviewer said before me, the focus really isn't on Richard Gere or his wife/daughter and their family. They all take a backseat to the deepness and loyalty of the relationship between a basically simple, but well educated man and his instant connection with an Akita. From the moment Hachi enters his life at the train station, the two form an inseparable bond that lasts long after Gere is gone. It's an amazingly powerful story that illustrates the undying devotion and loyalty a dog can have to his master. Obviously the most heart-wrenching scenes in the film occur at the very end when you realize that Hachi has spent the majority of his life living at a train station eagerly awaiting the return of Gere's character and is concerned with little to practically nothing else.

I don't know about anyone else, but the movie strangely made me feel quite resentful towards Joan Allen's character, basically because she resented the relationship between her husband and Hachi. That seemed a bit overdone in my opinion. Also the whole ""moving away following her husband's death"" and the half-hearted attempts of their daugher and her husband to take Hachi in...it just leaves you with a rather bitter taste in your mouth. However again, the point of the film was to really illustrate the power behind the bond between Hachi and Gere. Everything else sort of fails in comparison. Perhaps the most tear jerking scene in the film is the couple minutes before the end credits where you're lead to believe Hachi is having one of his final dreams while sleeping on the tracks. I like to think of it as the soul of his departed master coming to collect him as they both reunite in the afterlife.

Hachi is obviously not going to appeal to everyone, but it's probably the most emotional ""animal"" film I think I've ever seen. It doesn't have the earlier comedy routines that a movie like Marley & Me had, but that makes it softer and more emotional, and I even cried at the end of Marley & Me as well given that I've been through it with my own dogs.

Just thinking about Hachi makes my eyes a bit glisteny and VERY few movies draw me to tears. That tells me that although it has incredibly sad moments, the movie was extremely powerful with an amazing message. The time one spends with their pet is a gift. You can learn things from that relationship that you may never learn from the relationship with another person. There's always some facade of PCness or veil of phoniness in human relationships (even in the purest sense) you often see in the movies and even in reality. With a dog like Hachi, there was no pretense. It's simply instinct, loyalty, and raw emotion. I don't think you could get much purer than that with respect to love and having an emotional bond like that. Hachi will forever remain one of my favorite films even though I expect it to bring me to tears at the end. It's an inevitable reward from watching the film.",1339718400,8,4084,4.582763337893297

I don't like to say to much about the story as not to spoil any of the experence for the viewer. I just give my opinion if it is good or not. Man raises puppy then they are unfortantely separated that's the premise. Richard Gere is like always, ingaging and believable and supporting cast is good along with direction and photography. 5 star movie I will always tell it like I see it.

It condones animal cruelty.  I kept on waiting for each of the characters to step in and help the dog.  I know the movie is fiction but it is based on a true story from 1923 Japan.  I myself did a search on it to help me stop crying.  In fact, the real dog did go to the station every day but returned to his family home.  Please do not let your children watch this movie.  It is so sad and has no true message except loyalty isn't rewarded.  I am still disturbed by one of the last scenes where Hachi meets up with Joan Allen's character.  How the director couldn't have her scoop him off the street is beyond me.  I was so bothered by this movie, i had to write a review AND i couldn't even bother reading the good reviews.

But how much cute play time between a man and dog can a moviegoer endure? The rest of the move - dialog between husband and wife, the clumsy son-in-law, the fact that absolutely EVERYONE in town knows EVERYONE.

The handsome Gere and three beautiful dogs (puppy, main star and elder animal) can't rescue this movie from the bottom of the heap.

This movie was not about loyalty, it was about not being able to let go or move on.  Ten years later the wife comes back to the same small town to visit, and she looks like hell,  still as depressed as the day her husband died.  Why hadn't she tried to move forward in her life?  The dog got older and more beaten down as the years passed him by.

4054686,5,B0031RAOVY,"In late 2010 I happened across the movie ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" on the Hallmark Channel.  I DVR'd it but did not watch it right away.  When I did finally sit down and watch it several weeks later, I was blown away.  It does not get any better than this for a dog movie.  The fact that it was a true story of a dog who was so devoted to his master even after his master's death made it even better.  The casting, both canine and human was right on the mark.  I went out and purchased the DVD and have also enjoyed the 18 minute documentary on the making of the movie.  After watching this wonderful movie more times than I should have, I found myself falling in love with Hachi to the point that I wanted a Hachi of my own.  So off to Petfinder.com I went in search of an adult male Akita that needed rescuing.  I found a male Akita mix (amber and white coloring - same as Hachi) named Zeke that was picked up as a stray by a local shelter in St. George, Utah.  As I reside in New Jersey, I had to find a way to get him to me.  With the cooperation of a local rescue he was put on a direct flight from Las Vegas to Newark, NJ on December 7, 2010.  Of course his name was immediately changed to ""Hachi"".  I have not regretted saving my Hachi's life as his devotion to me is unsurpassed.  If you have not yet seen this movie it is a ""must"" for your bucket list.  I also bought many copies of this movie to give to people that were not aware that this movie even existed.  Shame on SONY for not giving this movie a theatrical release here in the United States as it went to movie theaters in every other country in the world.  Do we not have millions of dog lovers in our country?  Shame on SONY again for sending this movie straight to DVD with very little publicity.  I continue to educate my fellow Americans about the existence of this wonderul movie.  I am glad that Hallmark picked up this movie for the people that I cannot reach out to.

And here is a bonus that no one ever expected .... On May 19, 2012, there was an exact replica of the original bronze statue of Hachiko which resides at Hachi Station in Japan, unveiled at the train depot in Woonsocket, RI, where the movie was filmed. My Hachi and I attended and to our surprise he was invited to be part of the ribbon-cutting ceremony. He was front and center in the newspaper article photograph as ""a real-life standin for Hachiko"". It does not get any better than this for me and my boy. Long live Hachiko in our minds and our hearts.",1330214400,13,2495,4.124223602484472

4054705,4,B0031RAOVY,"I have daughters--which means I get to watch lots and lots of really sappy animal movies. :)

When I first heard about Hachi, I was afraid it would be just another formulaic feel-good tale about a pup. Then I read the cover--and then I remembered. It wasn't the first time I had read this story. I was stationed in Japan during my days in the military and I saw the statue of the real Hachiko at Shibuya Station in Tokyo then.

Overall, although the story loses something in its translation from 1920s Japan to 1990s America, the movie is really good, a tale of loyalty that will bring a lump to your throat.

And it also brings to the table some unique cinematography that I've never seen in any other animal movies. Everytime you look at a scene through Hachi's eyes, the camera goes to black and white. Dogs are, after all, color-blind. Very humorous, and very effective.",1326153600,3,874,4.518987341772152
4054706,4,B0031RAOVY,"I will be very honest.  Having seen this movie a few days ago, it's still very much on my mind, and probably won't leave for a while to come.  There are strong parallels to this story and the old Disney film, Greyfriar's Bobby, but the fact is that while the latter had something of a much happier ending, this one just had me in tears about three times.  My boyfriend was laughing because I couldn't turn off the water works.

Richard Gere was the idyllic dog owner whose wife didn't essentially want Hachi after he brought the puppy home, and it was easy to see what made man and dog bond.  It reminded me a lot of the relationship between our favorite of three labs and my brother, both no longer with us by only a matter of months apart (Bucky went first because he was very old and sick).

What this movie represents is the undying love and loyalty a dog has for its master--a lot better than most people have for each other--and that's saying something right there.  There is a lot of harsh criticism here about how the dog was just left loose to hang around near the train station and had nobody taking him in.  The daughter and her husband tried, but Hachi would not stay put, and I don't think he would have stayed put if anyone else had tried either.  He was too devoted to the memory and reunion with his master which (I hope this isn't considered a spoiler) he inevitably got.  As one of the characters said to the dog, ""You have to do what you have to do.""  Nobody bothered him, and people didn't exactly neglect him.  He was never discouraged from his mission, and it wouldn't have been right to deny him his choice.

The problem with this story is that it shows a dog who spends the rest of his life sadly waiting for something he wasn't going to get in this life, and that was what was so difficult to take.  That poor thing!  I also didn't care for the professor's wife, because it was obvious she was only putting up with Hachi for her husband's sake, and it made me angry that she didn't keep him in honor of his memory.  True, the kids liked and wanted him, but I wanted to slap her one when she moved away without seeming to think about it twice until returning to the town years later to encounter and old Hachi still sitting at the train station.  Maybe she couldn't handle the memories if she'd kept the dog, but I have a hard time swallowing that one.  We tried to keep my brother's other lab, Boomer, for over a year after he died, but he was just too big and energetic for us, and we had the breeder he got him from help us find a very good home for him.  Believe me, it was hard to do, but he's got a family that just loves him, and he's not bored like he was with us.  We called them and asked how he was doing a few times, and I'll always be glad we did the right thing in that way.

While the idea of love and loyalty lasting a lifetime is a very romantic gesture, somehow putting a dog in the picture makes it twice as hard a subject to deal with, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I just don't know if I could watch this again because it was so painful, but at least it taught the grandson a good lesson about love and loyalty, and I like that touch at the end.  If you like movies that are guaranteed to make you cry, this is definitely a good one.  If you love dogs a bit too avidly, you may only want to view this once, because it will definitely get to you and stay with you for a long time to come.",1325894400,,3435,4.107784431137724

People who HARM dogs, or FIGHT dogs, should be sat in a room all alone, to watch this movie!

If you have a dog, you will totally get it and will probably wind up buying an extra copy for your dog to watch while you are work. This movie proves absolutely why dogs are better than people.  Another thing about this movie:  I was never a fan of Richard Gere.  In fact, some years back there was this ongoing joke involving gerbils, but, well that's another story.  Anyway, Gere has now been completely exonerated by this movie and he now has my full respect. The acting by the people in this flick is very good, but the dog steals it in spades. And forget about getting through this without crying--this movie is very ""ruff"" on your emotions (sorry).  I could go ""fur""ther, but you get the point.  So go get the movie, six boxes of Kleenex and curl up with a hot chocolate and some Alpo.",1322006400,2,863,4.296296296296297
4054725,5,B0031RAOVY,"I don't think I've ever written a review on amazon despite buying literally thousands upon thousands of dollars on this site(You can click on my user id.  As you can see, I really haven't ever written a review), but this is the first one I will write because I truly am moved by this story and movie.  I bought this on the initial day it was released as I had heard about it, and was just dying to see the movie.  I went to best buy, and the guy I asked about it had no idea what I was even talking about.  My wife and I came cuddled up on the couch, and initially we were going to watch the movie, and then go out for a nice night afterwards..... Needless to say, after watching this move, we were in no shape to go out afterwards.  Being a dog owner myself, I could only sit there and look at her throughout the movie, and just think what her life is like from her point of view, and how she feels every day we leave or go out the door, and her level of excitement when we come home everyday.

This is truly a story of unconditional and eternal love, devotion and loyalty.  Something that only dogs and very can truly experience in my opinion.  It's so sad this never had a theatrical release, as it is an amazing movie, and EVERY single person I have ever referenced this movie to, also is amazed by what a touching story it is.  I cried for over 45 minutes of the 90 minute movie.  Heck, I even cried when I watched the two minute trailer.  After I saw the trailer, I knew I had to buy the movie.  I initially thought I was a total weakling, but after showing some of my friends the trailer, they were bawling by the end too.  If you do not cry in this film, I'm convinced you have a heart of stone.

I think the reviews speak for themselves.  5 stars on amazon is no small feat by any stretch of the imagination.  Very few movies/tv shows are able to earn such a prestigious rating.  Just buy the movie.  You will not be disappointed.  Can't believe it took me so many years to write a review, but I was saving it for something truly special.... and this movie is it.

Rarely moved by films to emotion, the story of this dog should remind us of the pure, uncomplicated and devoted love dogs have for their human companions.

Having been chosen once to be a dog's master, then losing that dog with his death, I didn't have a feeling for how it ""is"" for dogs when it happens the other way around.

By now, you've read what happens in the film, but do see this movie.  It is wonderfully done, touching and emotional right where and when you need it.",1321747200,,634,4.3474576271186445

4054735,5,B0031RAOVY,"I had never heard of the story of Hachiko.  So, one day I was looking on demand for a movie to watch.  I am a dog lover (I have 4 Maltese Dogs).  I stumbled on the title Hacki: A Dogs tale.  But, then something came up and couldn't watch it.  That night my husband had the television on and this particular movie was starting.  OMG! we watched (usually my husband falls asleep watching any movie that is not action-packed, needles to say he was wide awake). The story is so moving, well made and, acted by both actors and dogs.  I couldnot stop crying I didn't cry when parker (Richard Gere died, shock was more the case).  So, my husband and I were like whats gonna happen to hachi.  Well the dog going back to the train station every evening at the same time and, not wanting to stay with anyone, living on the train tracks just waiting for that train to come in and, the musical score just broke our hearts.  My husband who never cies,only when his mother passed away and our dog died, and myself were a mess.  When 10 years later Parkers wife goes to the cemetary to visit her husbsnds grave site and, upon heading back to the train station stumbles upon hachi I sobbed liked a baby.  Seeing hachi walk slowly and look dirty just tore into my soul.  The final scene is both sad (hachi's last walk to the train station) and, his owner, friend taking him home (heaven) was so moving I couldnot get that scene out of my mind.  I creid myself to sleep.  I immediately went on Amazon.com and bought the movie.  I have told everyone I know about this movie.  My grown kids 29, (female) and 21 (male) watched (I have never seen them cry, only when they were young) were crying like two kids. And, I cried all-over agin.  LOVE YOU HACHI!!!!",1317945600,10,1736,4.305555555555555

4054737,5,B0031RAOVY,"I really appreciated and could relate to this movie. I adopted a dog from a pet orphanage whose male owner had died. She immediately became attached to my husband.  One day soon after I got her, my husband left for work and  she kept going in his closet, the shower, etc. looking for him.  I thought she was sick and I took her to the vet because she was shaking in fear.  Now I realize she was afraid my husband would never return.

This must have been how it was for Hachi.  Like Hachi, she tried to escape when we first got her, and still goes up to any man she meets thinking maybe it is her deceased prior owner.  She is now happy, but at around 4 in the afternoon, she waits by the utility room door for my husband to come home through the garage.

Too bad Hachi could not have found peace or closure. I guess the heartache was too much to bear and the love he had for his owner could have never been transferred to another.  It was his since of devotion and duty to wait for his owner's return.  This movie is priceless and the director captured the pain and heartbreak in the dog's expressions.",1317600000,,1102,4.180094786729858

There are some animal movies that are sad and make you leave upset and thinking what the point of sitting through that was.  However, this is not the case in this movie.  Although it is tragic, it touches your heart and it really shows you the power of love and loyalty.  It's a story of transcending love that will move your soul.

It's beautifully directed by Lasse Hallstrom with a touching score by Jan Kaczmarek and gorgeous cinematography by Rob Fortunato.

4054753,5,B0031RAOVY,"This was a profoundly touching movie for me personally.  As a single, middle-aged man that has a dog companion who goes everywhere with me, I instantly related to this film and the special, unspoken bond between a human and a dog that many of us dog owners are so fortunate to have.  This movie even tops ""My Dog Spot"" which was another movie that connected with me in a very special way.

And yes, as a grown man, construction worker, former football player, the waterworks were running from my eyes by the end of the movie.  A pretty good sign that a movie has touched your heart is when you are still thinking about the movie days after watching it.

There isn't a lot more that I can say that hasn't already been said.  But I must get one thing off my chest which I thought was the most beautiful and poignant moment in the movie.  It was the scene of Hachi's passing, in which the now elderly Hachi was laying down at his usual perch in front of the train station, still waiting for his master to arrive.  Hachi fell into a peaceful sleep with happy dreams of all the joyous times he had spent with his master.  And it was with these cherished memories in his mind that Hachi peacefully slipped away to the heavens where he finally was re-united with his master.  I thought this scene was handled beautifully by the director and was a perfect way of portraying the closure to Hachi's life-long devotion and loyalty to his master.",1314921600,3,1434,4.418250950570342

On an even more personal level, I love the movie because the train station scenes were filmed at the Providence and Worcester Railroad station in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.  Everytime I watch the film, it's like a trip back home, which certainly magnifies the themes contained within the film for me in a deeply personal way.

All the performances are top-notch and Richard Gere and Lasse Hallstrom are to be congratulated for transforming this true story about love and devotion into a wonderful modern fable.  It's a sad story but it's certainly one that will stay with you for a very long time.",1312675200,,732,4.6875

4054773,5,B0031RAOVY,"Most movies are entertaining and when you have finished seeing them, you walk away thinking about it for a bit and that is that.  This movie REALLY hit a chord with me and I feel it was one of the more influencial movies I have seen in a long time.  It was done very well and I will watch it many times again, although now just seeing the trailer starts me tearing up.  I purchased it 2 hours after seeing it and I only buy movies I feel are truly inspiring in life.  I loved the shots from the dogs point of view as it gave you the dogs point of view to remind you this is a dog, a real dog.  Of all the movies I have seen about a dog, this IS the best one.  Not simply because I own Akitas, but because I truly believe a dog is a better friend than most humans will ever be, and this movie shows that point precisely.  A story of true devotion, unending loyalty and a true friend indeed.  Traits hard to find in todays world, but still possible with the right dog.

I have raised large dogs all my life and have a large pure bred male and large pure bred female Akita as I write this.  They are wonderful dogs; devoted, stubborn, smart and very strong willed.  The reason I adopted them as puppies years ago was due to the fact they are so loyal and I am experienced.  They are cute as puppies (as you will see in the movie), but also know they will grow to weigh in excess of 100 pounds and as portrayed in the movie, they are not much for fetching as mine both grow tired after one throw.  These dogs are independent and VERY devoted to my wife and I, but no one else.  If they are not socialized from the start, they will not take well to other people or animals.  These are not dogs you give away if you decide you don't like them later, once they bond to you they are yours for life (as it should be with all dogs really because who would give away their best friend).",1308960000,4,1875,4.0161725067385445

But with this movie I just could not help but cry like a baby. I could not control my emotions. The picture of hachi took over me even after the movie was over... My heart broke into pieces because at that moment I started thinking about all the animal abuse around the world. And I kept going back in my mind trying to picture Hachi and his 9 year journey. Please if you love animals watch it and if you don't love animals watch it anyways..this might change your mind. Right now I'm full of emotions I can't describe...we are horrible people hurting hopeless animals. Hachi will forever be in my heart...

4054777,1,B0031RAOVY,"The true story of Hachi was in Japan, in 1924. It was a touching story, not this nastiness spewed out by Hollywood.

Not only was this movie nothing like the true story of Hachi, it was probably one of the most vile stories of cruelty and neglect. I found myself wanting to crawl through the screen to slap these people silly. I could somewhat forgive the wife, she did not want the dog in the first place, but the ridiculous daughter just letting him go? Obviously the characters of this movie did not have a single viable functioning brain cell between them!

The part that offended me most was the scene 9 years post death, Hachi, dirty, old, slow, makes his way to the station, and the stupid wife sees him. Supposed to be all touching, here I was hoping Hachi would rip out her throat. Useless woman.

Why am I so angry about a stupid movie? Look to the fact that this stupid rotten movie caused the mindless masses to rush out and buy Akitas by the hoard... these are strong willed dogs, not for the stupid, lazy or even well meaning inexperienced.

No, this movie should not be supported for anything. The only character worth anything was the dog. Though, truth be told, that is very like reality. Dogs are the best people, and people can be completely useless in their self absorption and pettiness.",1308096000,27,1308,4.506329113924051
4054778,5,B0031RAOVY,"I'd heard about this based-on-a-true-story dog story on MSN's Best Dog Movies. I happened upon it, and settled in. Unlike most dog movies, or other animal-based stories, this film is not trite, sappy, cute. It's a shame that the audience that embraced Marley & Me didn't find this film as well. While Marley & Me is an enjoyable film about all the fun and frustrations of raising a dog from puppyhood to senior status, Hachi has an understated dignity. Marley & Me, dog integrates with family and learns his place within the pack. In Hachi, there's no pack. He's a one-man dog. Therein lies the difference between this dog movie and all others. It spins the stereo-type, and that's it's magic.

Richard Gere's naturalistic, understated performance as Hachi's owner sets up the plot. But the dog carries the movie. It's all about loyalty, trust, and unconditional love. Nice touches such as seeing the world from the dog's POV, in black & white as dogs are color-blind, sets up the finale which will leave no cheek unwet. If you're not crying 15 minutes from the end, check your pulse. You are dead. RIP.",1306108800,4,1103,4.744791666666667

I loved the true story of Hachi's deep love for his human.  Their relationship was mutual as you could see the pleasure each derived from being in the company of the other.  Hachi's deep desire to please was so evident when he surprised Richard Gere by doing something not common to his temperament, i.e., fetching.

This is a movie that, once seen, I cannot imagine it ever being forgotton.  Very highly recommended.  And, there is nothing in the film that is inappropriate for children.",1301356800,,630,4.73394495412844

I find nothing wrong with this film.  It's obvious that the dogs are the real ""stars"" but the humans are fine as well.  Richard Gere proves his versatility and is supported by Joan Allen, Sarah Roemer, Jason Alexander et al.  The score by Jan Kaczmarek is beautiful; the cinematography is gorgeous.

Wikepidia indicates that Hachi spent some time at the home of his owner,s gardener so there was a place he could go and maybe others too. Yet he never lost his love for his owner and never wanted another forever home as long as he was free to go to the station and wait.

4054800,5,B0031RAOVY,"Richard Gere plays Parker Wilson, a college professor, who encounters an abandoned dog at the commuter rail station.

 Gere has to convince his wife, unconvincingly played by Joan Allen, to allow him to keep the dog.

 The story develops around the relationship between Gere and the dog. The dog is somewhat idiosyncratic and won't fetch balls and such mundane things. But he becomes Parker's boon companion accompanying him to the train station in the morning and waiting for him to arrive back at the station at night. Hachi becomes well known in the small town and everyone from the stationmaster to the hot dog vendor to the local meat market treats Hachi well.

 It's a touching story, but only a prelude to the real story, the one that will quickly bring out the tissues. I'm not going to throw out any spoilers here, but Hachi goes on to prove his devotion to Parker.

 Gere does well in the role, but the real stars in this movie are the director (Lasse Hallstrm), the writer, the dogs who play Hachi from puppy to old age and the animal trainers.

 There are no hidden messages here. Just a sentimental journey and a good one at that.

Many years ago, I had a pet cat who, after I had left home to live elsewhere, continued to wait for me to arrive every night.

I can see the joy in their eyes when I return home from work, and I can see their sadness when I prepare for a trip where they can't come along (which are very few, so far we have not taken them to Australia because of the quarantine, but they have joined us everywhere else: USA and Europe alike). Hachi is just that. A film about that strong relationship among a dog and his person, which is as strong as the one among a parent and child.  And if you are a loving dog owner, you can't bear to see how sad your dog will be if you can't be with him or her anymore. My family and I watched this movie on TV the other night, and we all weeped for most part of it, even my eleven year old boy who likes to play the tough guy.  However, I would suggest this movie to any perspective owner, especially here in Italy, where many dogs are given as Christmas gifts and then left on the side of streets and highways a few months later.

I won't  say anything about this movie except it is about  a dog named Hachi and a professor named Parker - their love for each other - the love of a man for a dog - the love of a dog for man - a love that lasts more than a lifetime.  You just have to see it.

Richard Gere, you were wonderful in this but all of the cast was wonderful.  The cast played it to the hilt.  Your wife Cate, played perfectly by Joan Allen, who needs to be seen more and more, was excellent in her part.  Your daughter, Sarah Reomer must be watched!  Wonderful facial expressions!  Her husband and finally their son, all stole the show, too.  Everyone in this movie was more than great!  Although  I am still angry with Jason Alexander for ""coming-on"" to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman,  he redeemed himself in this movie!  At last!  Great acting.  Great expressions.  Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Ken was deep in his caring for both Parker and Hachi.  Great movie, glad I bought the rental from Amazon!  It's a keeper!

I understand that dogs are the most clever and sincere animal that really can be faithful for a long term friendship, and how lucky a person to be loved by this animal. Its a very unique feelings that every animal has with his owner. dogs teach us a big lesson in life to be faithful to whom we love the most, to be always remembered every seconds in our life, to express the affections in a simple action but with a big meanings of it. they don't need to pretend because every thing they do they express it genuinely. How beautiful when I see love in my pets eyes and behavior. Very honest animal I wish that people could have the smallest part of their honesty. We will live definitely in peace and quiet.

Its very very touching and said story, made me really really weep inside my heart and also eyes. I recommend it to those people who love animals, and have this passion about animals, its sad at the end but it will show you that you have the heart to feel this animal and learn something precious through experiencing watching its story.",1291161600,,1291,4.375

Allbeit, I was a bit surprised to find out so little happened in this movie. At first, I expected some adventure to come, or something tragical, but the story is just a very common story with a very basic line. This doesn't make the movie any less though.

Something I especially liked was the way this movie was made. The shots with the dog and the main actors are very clear, the music is just perfect, and the dog deserves an acting price. Richard was also well chosen for his role. The scenes with the dog following him to his work were very touching. Also the dog returning to his waiting place, I can't really describe the feeling it gave me. Such a deep friendship between the two.

I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I did. It's pretty simple in its story, not complicated at all, but yet it was so real. Certainly recommended.",1290729600,3,994,4.338709677419355

There are  many comical parts to the story when Hachi was young and it's very serious and heartbreaking as well as the end nears.  Overall it's a heartwarming story of a man and his dog.

Joan Allen would not have been my choice for his wife, but she grows on you as the story progresses and she redeems herself when she encounters Hachi after having been away for a number of years. It is very touching. Gere's professor colleague/friend was a great choice and lent some much needed Japanese history & background to the tale. Jason Alexander was the least sympathetic character but overcame his schmuck role with some dignity near the end.

Every child should see this movie for it character lessons and portrayal of undying love, as well as for its historical reference. It's on my list as Christmas gifts for the hard-to-buy friends. Enjoy again & again!",1290297600,,806,4.833333333333333

The local people give it hot dogs and this and that and ostensibly look after it, but its life sucks - until finally it keels over, late one night, by itself, in the middle of winter. Fabulous! I think the owner would have preferred the dog to, uh., move on (!) and have the happy life it would have had with him, except with someone else. Am I taking this too seriously?! Not really, when you think how many idiots out there abandon animals, thinking they'll be just fine on their own. What kind of message is this? That absconding with one's responsibilities is okay?! They couldn't think of another way of showing him maintaining his loyal watch without having to have him live this crappy life? In someone's romantic, deluded head, that ultimate loyalty makes for a great story. It ruined the movie for me.

All movies whether good or bad have moments in them that are high marks or passing scenes which are branded in memory. Hachi, for me has that moment- Everytime Professor Parker returned Hachi to his little backyard shed he would peek through the crooked wood pickets and simply---- look up to see his master and just look. We as the audience would see Hachis eye looking up. Oh that short scene just got to me. The entire movie transcends the boy and his dog (man and his dog) relationship to a spiritual one of total oneness. Hachi loved his master so much he that he never ever gave up waiting for his arrival. He was in fact waiting for him too in Heaven of course as we see at the end. This film is for all people period. Such a fine piece of movie making. I am glad Lasse H. directed as he was the perfect choice. This movie should be rated A for ALL Audiences!!! Boy if we could only treat each other with such loyalty, love and devotion the world would be......... But thats a different movie.

As you have read in other post about what happens I will not bore you with the details. I will tell you that you need to see this movie!! I cried almost from the start because Hachico reminded me of my Akita Max who I just put down a few months before this movie came out. The looks and mannerism was the same and it brought back great memories of my time with Max and how he waited for me when I was in the hospital for a week. So get your popcorn and klenex your favorite pet and see what love and loyalty are like in a age where even a spouse will leave you for no reason.

It is a great story of tremendous love and loyalty - although it is sad mainly b/c the other humans in Hachi's life aren't very loyal to him despite his loyalty. But, there is also a deeply spiritual message - especially the way it ends.
It is simply a great movie - the kind that affects you for a long time. I highly recommend this. And if you are a dog or animal lover add a star. If you aren't, you will be by the end of this movie. The fact that is based on a true story only makes it even better.

4054891,5,B0031RAOVY,"""Hachi A Dog's Tale"" paints a  poignant (as in painfully affecting the feelings) picture of the dog/human bond. The saying ""as loyal as a dog"" is defined by every frame in this sensitive film. If you love dogs and respect loyalty as a virtue, don't miss this touching tale (tail!) Please notice that Parker's family was too busy and unattached to properly care for Hachi. And Hachi rejected them anyway. Hachi was one of those one-man dogs. In my opinion, given the circumstances, it would have been cruel for Parker's family to lock up Hachi in some isolated garage or backyard to block Hachi's drive to wait for Parker at the railroad station.

Attachment and loyalty and relationship with Hachi and ""one"" person are the keys to understanding the movie. Indeed, Parker's daughter finally grasps that fact in a key moment of the film and opens the gate... some folks are reading way to much into the film, the events and the responses of some characters. To them, well, there's more to life than the polished Hollywood effort to bring to film a human interest story from 1920's and 30s. If you cry to hard to cannot watch it, well... visit a third world nation and see how they treat their pets.

Those who make their living at the train station; the hot dog vendor, ticket vendor, etc. say hello, pat the dog, feed him scraps (at least this is what is depicted in the movie) but no one takes him in. This dog was left to live on the street in all kinds of weather for 9 years.

4054907,3,B0031RAOVY,"Warning: This review is a spoiler fest, so please do not read it if you're yet to watch the film.

This is a very emotional movie, it WILL break your heart. Based on a true Japanese story. Hachi is an Akita dog who is brought up by a caring music teacher. After forming a very close bond with his dog, the owner dies and we are made to endure the most depressing 30 minutes in the history of cinema. For the next 9 years, Hachi waits outside the train station for his master to return. Until he passes too.

The reason I need to include spoilers is because I must express my frustration with this film. I cannot understand how the owner's family didn't make an effort to let the dog realize his master was dead. He should have been allowed to interact with the dead body. Dogs understand death by experience, they need to smell and see the body and experience it to mourn and find closure.

What we had in this movie is animal torture and not for one moment do I believe this was inevitable and normal.

I understand that this is what happened in the real story that the film is based on. In that case the story doesn't deserve a movie.

Unfortunately in today's world we are made to be tough, objective, a bit heartless and detach ourselves from our personal memories and feelings. This movie educates us to be loyal to our feelings and memories. In that respect, I applaud the film. Of course it's no secret that this particular breed has been domesticated for their companionship and loyalty. Come a long way from wolves.

But about how so much of this dog's life was needlessly and painfully wasted on an illusion, I am very upset, and it does not make for great viewing. There is no message, there is just tears.",1280361600,63,1717,4.383647798742138

Anyone who has a heart should watch 'Hachi - A Dog's Tale'. And yes - keep buckets of tissues handy and spare time to recover after the movie. I thought nothing could make me cry - BUT THIS can wrench out tears even from a stone. Its the most powerful emotional saga I have ever seen - an unforgettable and unbelievable account of eternal love and loyalty. It hit me - pierced my heart and my soul. I always hated tear jerkers because I am not fond of overtly sentimental movies that make one's heart heavy. That was before I knew that a movie could be THIS touching and POWERFUL - I was feeling really heavy after watching this and so just to lighten up a bit I watched one and then two and then three movies back to back (a comedy, an action flick and another drama) but barely a minute after even the third movie was over, the only visions that I had in my mind were of Hachi and I hardly remembered anything from the over six hours of movie watching in between!  This is because Hachi TOUCHES your heart DEEP and not just provides temporary sensory enjoyment - this movie will linger in your mind for ever. Its a true story and the dog is a legend. Suggest you do not research before you see it (resist googling) as it will spoil the effect if you know the story beforehand. Watch it. Its the most powerful and beautiful movie I have ever seen. Blessed is the one who has the fortune to have a dog like Hachi in his lifetime. I love you Hachi and we always will and remember you forever.

4054909,5,B0031RAOVY,"According to Amazon, I am the 97th reviewer to award a 5-star rating to this absolutely lovely movie, so I will keep my review short.

""Hachi"" is a beautiful, quiet, touching, and extremely moving film.

As others have remarked, the film affects one deeply--I cried my heart out while watching the film, and I was still sniffling while running an errand the day after I saw the movie.

Viewing ""Hachi"" also made me want to share this film with others, and I have been spreading the word to family and friends who would enjoy this little sleeper hit.

It was funny that my family watched ""Hachi"" as part of a ""double feature"" of films we checked out of the library.  The other movie was ""2012,"" a truly awful film that with all of its expensive CGI effects of the world being destroyed did not possess one iota of the power and grace of the the quiet, dignified little ""Hachi"" movie.

I can back up my review with my wallet. I bought the DVD for my home collection and plan to buy at least two more copies as gifts for friends who are dog-lovers, one whose dog showed similar love and loyalty to his owner at a time of crisis. I have not bought any movie for myself for a year and a half, but I wanted to reward those involved in making such a lovely film.

One caution is that even though ""Hachi"" is rated G and is found in the children's section of my local library, ""Hachi"" is not really a kids' movie. If you have a sensitive child, you might want to preview the film first, as some of the events shown in the movie are very sad.

""Hachi"" is an excellent choice for anyone who loves dogs, who has a heart not made of stone, and who does not require car chases, explosions, and Uzis to enjoy a movie.",1279584000,4,1702,4.263975155279503

Hachi's master is Professor Parker Wilson, who rescues Hachi, a young puppy lost at a train station.  Initially, Wilson's wife does not want to keep Hachi, but relents and he becomes a beloved pet.  The Wilsons have a daughter, but are mourning the loss of their dog, Luke.  Hachi brings the family from the brink of loss and back into the joys of love, sharing, and community.  But Hachi's grateful reach spreads to the town folk, and he becomes a fixture in town.

4054928,5,B0031RAOVY,"First it was Seabiscuit, then it was Marley and Me. Now a recent movie about the bonds of love and loyalty between an owner and his dog had me balling my eyes out during most of the movie. I never, ever cry during a movie, but with this one I was a mess. Hachiko: A Dog's Tale (2009) went straight to DVD, and for the life of me, I can't understand why. If Hachiko had made it into the theaters, it surely would have won a few awards. This movie has to be one of the best adaptations of a true life story I have ever watched.

Hachiko is based on an Akita Inu dog named Hachiko, who was owned by a professor of agriculture at the University of Tokyo in 1924 and how Hachiko would wait for him to come home from the train station even after his master died.

Hachiko: A Dog's Story is told in near perfection. Hachi arrives all the way from Japan as a puppy to the United States, but is lost and found walking around the train station by Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere. Parker takes the puppy home until he can find the owner. His wife Cate, played by Joan Allen, is not pleased. But after a few days, the little Hachi brings laughs and joy into their household. Parker tries to teach Hachi to play fetch, but Hachi refuses, because Parker's associate, Ken (Cary-Hiruki Tagawa) explains how Hachi is a proud and regal dog. He goes on to say how the bond between Parker and Hachi will never be broken.

Months go by, and before Hachi turns one, he has a new trick. He has figured out how to go back and forth to the train station as Parker goes into work everyday. For the next year, Hachi escorts Parker to the train station, then at 4:55pm, he is there waiting for Parker to come home. Carl, the ticket booth conductor, played by Jason Alexander, is not amused, but most of the commuters, as well as the hot dog vendor and bookstore owner across the street from the station think it's delightful.

And then one day, Parker doesn't return home. And Hachi waits and waits for his master everyday at 4:55pm for the next ten years to be reunited with him. Years go by, through snow, rain and wind, Hachi waits for Parker until that moment when they will be reunited.

I sobbed liked a baby to the point where I had a massive headache through most of Hachiko. Talk about a heartbreaking and moving experience, especially since it is all true. Richard Gere, as Parker, plays a wonderful and a loving husband, father and dog owner. The love and bond shown between Parker and Hachi lasts forever and regardless if you are a pet owner or don't really care for animals, this movie will break your heart.

Hachiko is the best family entertainment out there and will make your heart swell. This is the perfect example about how the power of love can last, even in death. There haven't been many movies in recent years that had such a profound effect on me. Hachiko certainly did and one I whole heartedly recommend you watch as soon as you can. I really can't find anything wrong about this movie. You may also want to have a box of tissues handy, because while you watch and for hours after, you will cry your eyes out.

*The legend of Hachiko lives on. His remains are kept at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. In April 1934, a bronze statue in his likeness was erected at Shibuya Station. The statue still stands there to this day.*

How that dog must have suffered for the wanting of his master who would never return.  Not for one minute do I believe that he hung out at the station for the treats he got from the vendors and other people that were there.  He could have had all of that by staying with the(Gere's)daughter.  There are people that love this deeply, why can't a dog?  Even though the actual event happened approx. 85 years ago, it feels fresh, sincere, and totally believable. I had more than a few tears.

4054937,5,B0031RAOVY,"When I was about 14 years old, I saw my mother trying to shoo away a dog with a water hose.  It was a scottie type dog and taking a closer look at it, it had a bad injury on it's side as it looked like it had been in a fight with a bigger dog.

I came from the Philippines two years earlier to rejoin my mother (after many years of separation) who had remarried and now living in the states.  I have never had any kind of a pet before, and I begged my mother to keep the dog... at least until it was healed.  I remember my mother advising me to put some hydrogen peroxide on his wound and she and my step dad let me keep the dog in the garage during that period.

My step-dad did not like dogs as he was bitten by one when he was a child.  But so was I, but that didn't keep me from feeling sorry for this dog and nursing him back to health.  I was fortunate enough to have my mother bat for me and was able to keep the dog, as long as he stayed outside and in the garage at night.

Talking about loyalty!  This dog would wait for me in the mornings and would go to the school grounds and stay around there until I got out of school.  The dog and I were inseparable and I spent most of my time with him outside, except when I had to come in to do homework and chores ... aaargh!  He was also a great watch dog, but my step dad didn't like it when it growled his next door neighbor out of the garage when he came in (by himself) looking for a tool of some kind.

To make a long story short.  My Step Dad was in the National Guard and every summer would have to go off to a summer camp for training.

I don't remember the year, but that year he wanted me to come with him where I could earn a little money shinning shoes and brass.  During the first week, I found out that the dog which I had named appropriately as ""Scottie"".  Spent the entire week traveling back and forth to school looking for me.  And every time my mother would come home in the car, the dog would sniff in and around the car, also looking for me.

My mother visited us in camp at the end of the second week and when she came back home, the dog did what he normally does (sniff in and around the car), but after that ... the dog ran off.

My school friends and both my brother and sister all said that the dog hang around the school for a few more days, then disappeared.  I can only hope that it found a new and loving owner!

Needless to say, it was the saddest summer in my life!  I am now in my late 60's and to this day ... I will never be without a faithful companion.  I have had several dogs since and one thing I found out ... the most faithful dogs one can ever find, is that one you rescued from the animal shelter.  They seem to know that they've been rescued from a place that could become much worse.

So, if you're looking for a dog... please check the animal shelter first .. you never know what you might fall in love with!",1274918400,15,2909,3.898132427843803
4054938,5,B0031RAOVY,"I heard of the famous dog through fellow dog-lovers before the movie was made. I never got around to reading the book but watched the DVD as soon as released at a friend's house. We typically 'half-watch-half-talk' through movies as we all probably have a bit of attention deficit disorder. However, ten minutes into the movie ""Hachi"" we were consumed with the low-key and realistic tempo of this little gem. This movie is destined to be a classic dog flick for it's unassuming portrayal of dog-human relationship. The main human character played by Gere is quite authentic and not overplayed. He pulls off a sublime character we can all identify with: a practical man, not overly sensitive or dog-crazy that lacks something in his life only a loyal dog can bring. His relationships with wife and family are brilliantly depicted and work well into the subtext of the bond developed between he and Hachi. This particular point is what made me fall in love the movie--how we (men) can find fulfillment through the singular devotion of a dog. What's more, the main plot rolls along at a slow, rhythmic pace, not unlike that of a public commuter's, which I have to assume is intentional. It works. But the real show-stealer is Hachi the dog himself. Hachi's singular and selfless purpose had the group of us in tears (lots of debris in our eyes during the show). However sad some parts can be, you get a sense of humanity and compassion throughout the movie that I find myself thinking about days after the credits role. In short, ""Hachi"" takes a true legend and turn it into a realistic story that will have grown men, women, and children in tears, dog-lover or not. I highly recommend this gem in your collection.",1274832000,5,1711,4.725752508361204

4054940,4,B0031RAOVY,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale is based on a beloved true story from Japan.  Director Lasse Hallstrom has done a nice job bringing the tale to America and bringing it to life.  Richard Gere plays a professor who finds a lost Akita puppy (actually an adorable Shiba Inu, a smaller breed that the filmmakers could work with easier) at the train station and brings him home. This doesn't sit well with his wife (the always fantastic Joan Allen), for some reason, but of course she soon relents. Hachi is very devoted to his master, so much so that he meets him every evening at the station.  *Spoiler Alert* When a tragedy changes everything, the townspeople are amazed to see that Hachi continues to return every night for his master who will never return.  The film has lots of heart-breaking moments, mostly due to Hachi's lonely loyalty.  Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a warm story that will appeal to lovers of Marley & Me. Overall, thought, the film suffers from plot points that are necessary to advance the story and to follow the true events as closely as possible, but which don't ring true. In the actual tale, Hachi's owner had no family, so it was logical that no one adopted the dog after his master's death. In Hachi, however, it just feels wrong that Allen and Gere's married daughter would let Hachi run away and live on the street, so that he can keep returning to the station to look for Gere. Hallstrom works hard to justify this harsh plot development, but it doesn't make sense that Gere's daughter and wife wouldn't make sure Hachi was well taken care of.  The ending is reliably sob-inducing, though.  If you can dull your sensitivity to the story's unintentional cruelty, you'll find Hachi your new best friend.",1274227200,4,1715,4.64026402640264

4054953,5,B0031RAOVY,"Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a modernized and Americanized remake of Hachiko Monogatari (""Hachiko's Story""), a 1987 hit film from Japan based on the inspirational story of real life dog, Hachiko. Hachiko is immortalized in the hearts of millions of people around the world for his devotion to his master in addition to being immortalized in actual physical form: a bronze statue of him stands in front of Shinjuku Station in Tokyo where he used to wait, and at the National Science Museum in Ueno, he has been stuffed and mounted for display.

Hachi is Richard Gere's second Japanese remake, after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0006GAI6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance? (Widescreen Edition)</a>. It's refreshing to see this version remain largely faithful to the source material instead of being completely butchered like so many remakes. Some detail changes were made to make it more accessible to American audiences, but the overall story structure, plot progression, and spirit are the same (mostly). A word of warning before you watch this: it tugs at heart strings and can leave you a sobbing, emotional mess. If you're the sort to cry at these kinds of movies, you'll be doing a lot of it here, especially towards the end.

In the original, the story takes place in pre-WWII Japan, starting with the birth of a litter of pups in Odate, Akita one wintry night. One of them is then sent to Dr. Hidesaburo Ueno (given as Eisaburo in the epilogue of this film, an alternate and possibly wrong pronunciation), a professor of agricultural science at Tokyo Imperial University to replace his dog Gonsuke, who had died the previous year. His daughter accepts the pup, against the initial reluctance of Ueno and his wife. In Hachi (2009), the story begins in Japan with a pup being shipped to America from a Buddhist temple. He falls off the back of a luggage cart and is found by Parker Wilson (Gere), a professor of music and dance at a nearby college in the fictional town of Bedridge, Rhode Island.

In both stories, the wife does not wish to keep the dog, but here, Cate (Joan Allen) is an architect instead of a housewife. (In the original story, the couple also had 2 servants.) From here, the two stories are mostly the same. We see Hachi and Parker bond quickly, and several of the key scenes from the original are faithfully preserved (again in spirit, if not exact details), like the bathing scene, the stormy night, and the massage. Erick Avari is a hotdog vendor instead of a yakitori seller. We see a bit of cultural exposition from Parker's friend Ken (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), a Japanese profesor whose Zen-like wisdom aids in helping Parker understand Hachi's name, a bit about Akita dogs, their significance in history, and Hachi's role in Parker's life. This also helps audiences appreciate a bit of Japanese culture.

Things I really didn't like: The story is wrapped by Parker's grandson's retelling during show-and-tell class, called ""My Hero"". It begins with him and ends with him. The film didn't need this extra layer of removal from the intimacy of the original. Secondly, some really jarring scenes use ""dog's eye view"" where the entire scene is shown from Hachi's perspective in shaky black and white (dogs are totally color-blind?). This was totally unnecessary and distracting. Lastly, the changing of the seasons wasn't handled with nearly as much subtlety and finesse as the original did. We see a low angle three-quarters shot of Hachi with a tree behind him losing its leaves, blowing away, then growing back again, then losing its leaves, then growing back again three times, to signify the passing of the years. This was a really blunt, hit you over the head way of showing the passage of time.

Overall, some intimacy is lost when translating this story to an American suburb and car culture. The spread of a small American town feels very different than the densely-packed Tokyo environs and walking culture of the original though the core message of love and loyalty still shines through. Despite these differences, this movie is still very good and worth seeing. It's suitable for the entire family and Gere and Allen both turn in fine performances. I particularly liked the understated piano music that serves as the soundtrack for many of the scenes. A very enjoyable film, but beware the tear-jerker factor. If you liked this, you should seek out the 1987 original as well.",1272758400,2,4499,5.049798115746972

 I have a an Akita Inu, and the difference from every other dog breed I have owned is beyond explanation. This is the only dog I have had that dug her way back into my yard after inadvertantly getting locked out by an unsuspecting family member, so when you see this movie, you will see a story of an an animal that is hard to describe as just a dog. Her mannerisms are far separated from any other breed of dog I have have the good fortune to witness.

 A story of an animal that devotes itself in a way that is uncommon, and not seen in the average dog. When you see this movie, it is a picture of a breed that cannot be described in terms of any other. The inteligence, mindset, and characteristics of the Japanese bred (not the American) Akita is far from anything most people experience in a dog breed. The movie captures only a small piece of the kind of animal that was carefully bred over many centuries, and because of a few owners who have no idea what they had is misunderstood in society.

 Yes, the movie will make you cry, perhaps some will think it sad and feel badly for the dog, but in understanding this breed and this spectactular animal you will see that Hatchi was doing exactly what made him desire to exist. We as people can take a lesson from the story if we could only devote ourselves to our mates the same way.

 My ""Hatchi"" Akita literally picked me when I went to get her as a puppy, I did not choose her. Too many people think they can choose a Japanese Akita, only to find they are not matched as they could be. As in the story, the the dog chooses their companion. This fact will be missed by many who watch this, but hopefully many more will see what transpires here. The story is told in such a way as to capture some of the great characteristics of a breed that was almost driven to extinction, and those of us who have experienced one first hand are grateful they are still with us and can relate to this wonderful story.",1271980800,3,2220,4.2440758293838865

  Richard Gere and Joan Allen are perfect as the professor and his wife who live in New England with their daughter. Of course the numerous Japanese Akitas who play the part of Hachi, at various stages of life from puppy to old age are all lovable ""baby bears!""

Overall, it stays fairly true to the actual story, although there were some creative differences necessary to develop the story on film within time constraints and to allow the audience to connect with the characters. This is a film for the entire family, and especially animal lovers. Akita fanciers will especially enjoy the movie, as it recounts the real-life tale of the Japanese akita Hachiko, whose story is well known among akita folks. For purists who questioned the relocation of the setting to the U.S., put your reservations aside.

4054971,2,B0031RAOVY,"I read the book,  Hachiko Waits, to my third grade class every year. We have researched the story of Hachi and have photos him and his statue in Japan hanging up in our classroom. Hachiko is an anchor text in my class and we refer to it often when discussing character traits like loyalty, caring and responsbility.  When we heard a movie was being made of out favorite dog story we were thrilled.  I explained to the children that this was a different version of our favorite story because it was set in America but the professor and Hachi were still the central characters.
Children love to see their favorite stories come to life.  I ordered the movie as soon as it was available.  Unfortunately I can not show it to my class.
Instead of making a movie true to the legend, about a dog's faithful devotion to his master, the producers chose to make Mr. Gere(the professor# and his relationship with
his wife#Joan Allen) more prominent in the movie.  One of the early scenes shows the professor coming home with the puppy and hiding it in a room in the house.  His wife appears and
seductivly invites him up to their bedroom for a proper welcome home.  While there is no nudity, the subtle sexual message is clear.  Scenes of the unmade bed and the wife's lingere are too implicit.  I am disappointed with the writers of this movie.  Why take a classic story and muddle it with such scenes?  Further on in the movie there is more time spent developing Richard Gere's character while he is away from the dog then the time spent with Hachiko. Did producers have to create a more developed role to get more recognizable actors to do the movie?
Some people may enjoy the movie but folks who are aware of the real story will be disappointed.  Educators do not purchase this film if you intend to show it to children.  Children today see far worse images at home on television, it is true, but our schools are held to much higher standards.  I would not risk the controversy.",1270857600,10,1970,4.49438202247191

My interest in this film was piqued by an article in Entertainment Weekly about why it was direct to DVD and not wide-released.  Still not sure why - I think that this film would definitely tug at the heartstrings of any Marley & Me fans.  It has a great cast, love Joan Allen in everything and Richard Gere was so believable as Hachi's savior, owner, and true soulmate to the end.  This film was beautiful, inspiring, so touching, and really just powerfully illustrated that love and loyalty have no boundaries between species.  I would absolutely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys animal or dog stories, good for kids, although it will probably produce some sniffs and tears toward the end.  I won't spoil it, but it is definitely worth the viewing.  Great cast, great story, fantastic dog, and all inspired by an amazing true story.  Personally, I found this film to be superior to Marly & Me because it did not get the typical polished and overglamourized Hollywood treatment.  By keeping it simple and true, it retains a more serious and emotional story.  Wonderful film, I encourage everyone to give Hachi a try - you will love it!",1270598400,2,1284,4.760180995475113

Yes - me, I cried at three separate moments, not because I was being manipulated by the story, but, I was touched by it. Hachi's devotion is truly beautiful, his love for his master heart rending, and this movie is not to be missed.

The crazyest thing about this whole movie is that I have a cat named Hachi! I did not know anything about this movie or the story of Hachi-Ko when I named my cat over two years ago. I love the Japanese language and when I went to adopt him his coller had the number 82 on it to tell him apart from the other kittens and he was the last one in the bunch so I adopted him and the number in Japanese is Hachi-ju-ni so that is his full name but we just call him Hachi! I couldn't believe it. I had never heard of that name for an animal before! I thought I had an original name, guess not so much!

Enjoy this movie for the story because it is a very heart warming story!",1269907200,3,867,3.865168539325843
4054981,5,B0031RAOVY,"As the owner of an Akita for almost 12 years (now at 'The Bridge'), I have been anxiously waiting for the Hachiko Monogatari, 1987 Japanese production, to be adapted for the American audience. I was so pleased that they kept the story simple; one of a man and his dog, of forging bonds of unconditional love and devotion. And, even though I knew the story very well and, prepared myself in advance, the tears were inevitable.

Going straight to DVD, this film will not be a big money maker, therefore, I consider it a timeless gift and treasure, from all involved with the project.  It was not easy, taking a year to complete, clearly becoming a labor of love.  Watching Gere interact with the dogs, you can tell he is truly in his element. The joy on his face makes you believe that Hachi really is his devoted companion. I truly thank and respect Gere for joining such a challenging endeavor and I can't think of anyone more perfect for the role of the sensitive Professor.

Throughout the film, it was made fairly clear, that Akitas are not typical dogs. This was further evidenced in the 'Making of the Film.'  The trainers thought they had met their match, when two months into the project, the dogs simply would not perform.  They found that Akitas are no trick-ponies; they are stubborn and don't suffer foolish tasks.  With much patience, the project was eventually successful. You will also find a comment following the credits about how Akitas are NOT for everyone.  I consider these additions to the film to represent responsible education regarding Akita ownership, and, I applaud them for the inclusions.

I must add, that although I dearly love Akitas, they are not the only breed with histories of bravery and devotion.  Given proper training and bonding, some mixed breed dogs that we unfortunately see chained in backyards, might show the same call of duty. It's not so much about the breed, but creating the connection---opening one's heart, and truly letting that furry creature in, which Gere lovingly demonstrates in the film.

I think Hachiko's story is a good reminder, that ALL dogs have thinking, emotive minds; that they are, family, not something to be possessed. That said, Hachi will continue to educate us from the grave, for generations to come.  I can't think of a more profound legacy.

This is a beautifully rendered, family film---one that, once watched, will never be forgotten. It is destined to become a classic.  I can't recommend it highly enough; just have tissues at hand.",1269734400,126,2514,4.816279069767442

4054983,5,B0031RAOVY,"It's not a complex or avant garde film - it is not about that.  This is just an American rendition of the story of the famous dog from Japan, Hachiko.  It is simple, but poignant.  If you like dogs, or animals in general, you should love this film.  If you are not such an animal lover, you may even like it.  It tugs at the heart, and without having  to ""say it"" in dialogue, this film is an allegory about how gestures really display your love.  This film is a small reminder to us about how loved ones, pets, and the little things in life are best and most important.  I really enjoyed this film but was weeping for about half of it - be warned.  They were good tears though. :)

The movie itself was well made, with good production value, and did the nice balance of not being too cheesy, and digestible for adults and kids.  The acting was good too for the genre.  When you think family dog movie, you think corny and cheesy acting and cliched items, but this film really does a good job of having elegance and not being too kitschy.  I like how the writer(s) and director stayed true to the Japanese real life story while adding the American touch to it.  Furthermore, the showed the story, used actions and gestures to develop the sentiment and strength of the emotion running in this film; i.e., they did not ""tell"" it.  As much as this is a story about Hachi, the film was about the family, friends, and the town, and I like how the story and scenes were put together to give the film depth and emotion.  In a time of special effects and over the top plots, this movie was a welcome change.

As much as dogs and animals are part of our fabric it is hard to avoid kitsch, but this film is one of the best dog movies ever, and a good film in general.  But it should not even be analyzed like that.  It is meant to be a popcorn eating and watch the show movie.  It does the job, and does the job well.  Movies like these are treasures, because they snap us out of our hectic and consumer driven lives and remind us to live.  For art and for movies like this, I am grateful because even the best of us need a reminder once in a while.  Hachi is a sobering reminder that family, friends, and pets are what makes us.  As an aside, this is coming from a man whose list of favorite movies include Apocalypse Now, The Godfather II, Goodfellas, Heat, Snatch, Pulp Fiction, and Inglorious Basterds.  That says something.

When I watch a movie with my wife, it is usually without enthusiasm, and I generally find myself sneaking peeks at my watch every few minutes, calculating how much longer the movie will run.  Prior to seeing the story of ""Hachi"", Richard Gere meant little to me.  His portrayal of the master of ""Hachi"", though, was moving, sweet, and ingratiating.  Mr. Gere is the most prominent actor in a fine cast, which helps to make this movie transformational.  The story depicts with love and sensitivity the strong and indelible bond between man and his eternal best friend, the dog.  Hachi is a loving akita who is loyal to the character played by Mr. Gere, seeming to always remember that it was Gere who rescued the lost pup at a train station.  Originally intending to find the rightful owner of the dog, something which did not ever happen despite significant initial effort, the two quickly become inseparable, devoted companions.  Theirs was a devotion which transcended death.  Following the sudden and untimely passing of the character played by Mr. Gere, Hachi continued to wait at the train station at which he would greet his master when he returned home from work each day.  Certain scenes and premises are implausible, such as when years after his death, the master's widow returns to the area the two had lived in together, surprised to see Hachi at his daily perch in the town square, as he had done for years.  The bittersweet and moving reunion between the two renders the implausability of the scene unimportant.  This movie is all the more powerful in consideration of the fact that it is based on a true story from Japan, in which Hachi lived in the 1920's and 1930's.  Hachi is honored with a statue on the site of his daily vigil, and is memorialized by Japanese dog-lovers every year to this day.  The story of Hachi is one that I cannot get out of my mind, and it shall always be dear to me.  At a time in which our world is becoming increasingly coarse and uncivil, how wonderful to find an uplifting and inspirational movie like this, and it is rated 'G'!

4054986,5,B0031RAOVY,"Written by my 10 year-old...

Hachi was the first movie in which I cried, but it was all worth it. The film is basically about a dog (Hachi) that falls out of his crate and is found by Parker (Richard Gere). Parker's first plan was to find Hachi's owner, but noone claims him, so he keeps him. Parker is a professor in music and rides a train to work everyday. Hachi soon starts coming to the train station everyday to wait for Parker when his train gets back from work. Then tragedy strikes. Parker does not come home, but Hachi continues to come back everyday. He is fed by locals who think that Hachi is a great dog because he is so loyal. Hachi seems to know that Parker isn't coming back, and starts sleeping at the train station, sitting in front of the train station's doors. This goes on for the next ten years. The real Hachi died in March of 1934. At the end it shows a flashback of Hachi and Parker that made me cry. I think it must have been very hard on Parker's family even though they didn't show it all. The family's daughter recently got married and is expecting her first child. Their son never knew his grandfather, but thinks Hachi is a hero.",1269129600,7,1162,4.281818181818182

My wife Chris and I watched it with our Greenland Husky Avu, and at a number of places in the story, I reached down and petted Avu.

The movie, based on a true story from Japan, features a wonderful and very expressive Akita, played by several dogs, and its life with a college music professor and his family.
And there is another kind of family at the commuter train station where Hachi comes to say goodbye in the morning and then is there at the end of the work day to welcome the professor home.

It is a simple story in some respects, but not overly emotional. There are times when we  worried and wondered if Hachi would make it safely through the day, and others when we felt warm and cozy, like this mutual affection would never stop.

Of course, the calendar moves on and does sometimes bring bad news,but the love that
we have for dogs and the affection they have for us will go on forever, I believe.

Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance. This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature, ""I read the script, cried, and couldn't say no.""  The story was too good for him to pass up.

That's my recommendation to you: watch the DVD, sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend, exhibiting loyalty such as you have never seen.",1268870400,3,615,4.239316239316239

But all in all, this remake is pretty good, definitely a tear jerker, especially if you are a dog lover.  I had seen the original Japanese version when I was a kid and a few times after that, and I would have to say that if you haven't seen the original, it's definitely worth watching as well - that is truly the most authentic one, and I would have to say, more touching!  The American and Japanese versions mirror each other in many ways, but most notably the part in the beginning is very different, in the circumstances where Hachiko comes into the professor's life.  In the Japanese version (true story), I believe the professor's daughter (who in the Japanese movie is initially represented as pretty self-centered - if you saw it, you know what I mean) originally wanted an Akita and her father reluctantly gets one for her, but a short while after the puppy arrives, the daughter soon gets married and has a kid so the professor slowly becomes the one that take cares of Hachi, since in that version, the daughter is not interested in Hachi and no longer wants a dog whatsoever anymore (as opposed to the daughter in the American version), after she has the boy.  Also, the professor in Hachiko Monogatari doesn't seem to be that into Hachi in the very beginning as Richard Gere's character (because the professor in the Japanese movie wasn't the one who had originally wanted to get Hachi in the first place as explained above), and is much more colder, but then gradually opens up to Hachiko and then he becomes a much sweeter person (to the dog) and they are inseparable.  Other than that and a few other slight differences, everything is pretty similar between the two.  I highly recommend this remake, it's a keeper.  If you think about it though, it is really amazing what Hachiko did in real life for all those years - now THAT is just so incredibly loyal!!",1268784000,5,2045,4.493261455525606

With a touching story like this, I guess it's hard to go wrong. I especially appreciate the director and the cast for not having made it too sentimental. For those nippers out there, you can't miss it. Hachi is so adorable and dignified, although it pains me in the end because I wished the dog hadn't done what it did. But dogs are dogs,they have their own mind, which makes them so precious. As an animal lover myself, I hope everyone who has a dog can just treat it the way it deserves.

4054997,1,B0031RAOVY,"WARNING! Spoiler Alert!

I'm an animal lover so I really wanted to see this film. I am very particular about not having any spoilers before seeing a film for myself or reading reviews. I knew the story was going to be sad and it was. In the beginning I had high hopes for the film as it felt inspiring, at first. After all, an animal's devotion and loyalty wins over the hearts of those who try to resist and he ends up in a loving home. Everyone's life is enriched. But for me something went drastically wrong after the owner's death.

The film is a tear jerker. I cried, for the loss of the family as well as the dog's loss. And I kept waiting for someone to care enough about this intelligent, loyal dog to care for it. But, no one did. It was so disturbing to me that I couldn't even speak. That poor animal was abandoned by his entire family, because he was too loyal and devoted. Over the years hundreds of passers by and employees said hi and neglected him. No one even bothered to put up a shelter for him or a blanket. He was not rescued.

I realize this is based on a true story and we all know that human cruelty has no bounds. What was so shocking to me is that the makers of this film had no problems changing the location of the story and embellishing it as they saw fit. Why did they completely ignore the neglect that dog suffered? It is supposed to be a dog's tale, right? And I guess freezing in winter, baking in the summer, having all the people in your life throw up their hands and walk away from you, fighting to survive on the streets and dying alone was great joy for Hachiko?

I expected that the makers of this film would have warnings at the beginning and end of the film about adopting pets or purchasing from reputable breeders. I was sure they would have acknowledged that this wonderful, loving animal deserved better than what happened to him. This movie, actually looking at it from Hachiko's perspective, left me feeling sick and angry and crushed.

I've been searching the net and haven't heard one thing about any of this film's proceeds doing anything to help any animal. I have rarely found any review expressing concern for how this precious animal was forced to live after his owner died. I feel like these filmmakers preyed on animal lovers' appreciation of the special bonds we share with the many species on the Earth to loosen our wallets. It truly horrified me and I would NEVER watch this film again and wish I had not seen it to begin with. It glamorizes animal neglect.",1268524800,52,2518,4.371794871794871
4054998,5,B0031RAOVY,"There are some films that deserve a five star review for reasons other that artistic success on every level; HACHI; A DOG'S TALE is one of those, for despite some minor technical problems with the film (the sound editing seems absent as the music - a fine score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental until it becomes clear that this is 'a dog's tale' and dogs see in black and white!), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers.  Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both  Kaneto Shind and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallstrm.

The story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale).  The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen).  But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs.

And that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal.  It is a little film to treasure.  Grady Harp, March 10",1268524800,10,1998,4.855882352941176

4055000,5,B0031RAOVY,"My dog and I watched this last night, and it was unbelievable.  I was upset when it was bumped from theaters, but after seeing it I am guessing it is because the movie was a little more on the artistic side rather than mainstream.

One of the articles that I read about the movie before it came out described it as story that shows that love knows no species, and that couldn't have been more apparent through Hachi and his devotion to the professor.  It ripped my heart out to watch him walk to the train station every night waiting for his master to return, even after the professor had died.

I cried like a baby even after the movie was over.  Anyone who believes that animals don't have feelings just needs to watch Hachi's story and there will be no question.",1268438400,7,765,4.359154929577465
4055001,5,B0031RAOVY,"I have known the story of Hachiko for years, and sometimes just thinking seriously about the story would bring tears to my eyes (yes, I am sensitive like that.) However, this film totally got under my radar when it first came out in the State. For some unknown reasons, this film, which features acclaimed director and actors, got a VERY limited release before going straight to DVD. Whoever made that decision should be kicked in the ass and fired. Fortunately, the film scored a decent screening in Thailand, my home country, just last week. My parents saw it and quickly told me about how they cried their eyes out at this movie. I was a bit skeptical at first. Why would a film of this quality become a straight-to-DVD when far worse movies manage to hit the cinema? In the end, I checked out the reviews in Amazon and IMDB before deciding to buy it. Apparently, Hollywood decision makers are really stupid...

THIS FILM IS GOOD. For some of you who prefer more actions and a climax, this film might not be entirely for you, but it won't bore you out. For those who are hesitant about seeing a sad dog movie, you should take a chance. It isn't the usual Hollywood melodrama. Everything is played out subtly with a strong sense of just being an everyday life scene. To top that off, it features one of the best acting from Richard Gere. I might be biased from liking the actual story that the movie is based on, however, I usually dislike a cheesy dog movies or a movie that attempts too hard at being a tearjerker, and this film is neither of the two.

4055002,5,B0031RAOVY,"I have a 4 year old son, so I'm definitely no stranger to the family-friendly genre of movies. Most movies I can enjoy along with my son, while certain others are just a bit too corny for even a young mother like myself to handle. So when I saw the previews for ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"", I knew my son would enjoy it (since he'll watch any movie that involves dogs), but I was a bit weary of it, especially considering the 'G' rating. Even most cartoons these days pass with at least a PG rating. So I popped the dvd in and sat down with my little boy, expecting to fall asleep halfway thru the movie, if not sooner.  But nearly an hour later, I was dead wrong. I found myself sitting straight up, unable to pry my tear-filled eyes away from the screen. I've always been more of a cat lover myself, but even my beloved cat Bitty couldn't hold a candle to Hachi's loyalty to his owner, Parker (well played by Richard Gere). Most dog or animal movies (such as 'Homeward Bound' or 'Air Bud') are fun to watch but are just too cheesy for me, but Hachi was able to move me to tears without being overly 'mushy'. It's based on a true story, so it's real as well as realistic, which made me appreciate it more. My son enjoyed it as well, but still too young to fully understand why the movie made mommy so sad. It is definitely a tear-jerker, but still inspiring and leaves you with a sense of hope at the end. Hachi was an amazing dog who inspired many people around him and brought out the best in everybody, including myself, but in his own mind, he simply just missed his best friend: He gives a new meaning to ""man's best friend."" I encourage everybody of all ages to watch this film, I'm sure it will be a modern classic as timeless as 'Lassie' for years to come.

One thing that gives this show emotional punch is that it is based on a true story.  If the G-rating puts you off, don't let it.  If you are hesitant because it's a ""dog movie"" get over it.

4055006,5,B0031RAOVY,"When I first visited Tokyo, Japan, one of the stories that intrigued me before my trip was the story of Hachiko, a dog who would wait outside Shibuya Station back in the 1930's.  [Note: Although the story is quite popular and well-known for those who gone to Japan, I won't spoil the details of the actual tale].

The story of Hachiko touched producer Vicki Shikeguni Wong during her trip to Tokyo and inspired to make a film titled ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" based on the true Japanese story for American audiences.  Directed by Oscar-nominated director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (""Chocolat"", ""Cider House Rules"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"") and a screenplay by Stephen P. Lindsey (""When they Could Fly"", ""The Secret of Fireflies""), the film would feature cinematography by Ron Fortunato (""Gossip Girl"", ""Catch a Fire"", ""Brotherhood"") and music composed by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek (""Get Low"", ""Horsemen"", ""Unfaithful"").

The film revolves around college professor Parker Wilson (played by Richard Gere, ""Pretty Woman"", ""Chicago"", ""Unfaithful"", ""Primal Fear"") who was coming home from a trip and a small Akita who was accidentally left behind walks up to Parker who then takes the dog back home.

Unfortunately, his wife Cate (played by Joan Allen, ""The Bourne Identity"" films, ""Face/Off"", ""The Contender"") is not thrilled to see a dog in the house, even when their daughter Andy (played by Sarah Roemer, ""Disturbia"", ""Fired Up!"", ""The Grudge"") pleads with the mother to keep it.

Parker then learns from his friend Ken (played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, ""The Art of War"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"") that the dog's name is ""Hachi"" and is an Akita that were popular in feudal Japan. But as Parker tries to find its owner and tries to give the dog away, he finds himself loving the dog and Cate just notices how he is really loving his company with the dog and thus, allows him to keep it.

Fast forward year(s) later and Hachi is a grown dog who is loyal to his owner.  He goes home when Parker tells him to and when he hears the incoming train whistling, Hachi knows that his master is coming home and runs to the station and greets him near the station exit.  Among the people who are familiar with Hachi's routine is Carl (played by Jason Alexander, ""Pretty Woman"", ""Seinfeld"") who works at the station, Jess (played by Erick Avari, ""Heroes"", ""Dragnet"") who runs a hot dog concessions stand outside of the station and often gives food to Hachi and a few other business owners around the area.

And throughout the seasons, Hachi has repeated his routine of waiting for his master through warm and cold, heavy snow days and has always been loyal to Parker by waiting for him when he returns to the station.  But one day, Parker has a stroke and for Hachi, his loyal dog continues to wait for him.

VIDEO:

""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray as it manages to capture the seasons as Hachi waits for his master.  Blacks are nice and deep, detail from the fur of Hachi to detail on Parker's wool suits.  Skin tones are natural and again, the detail from the various seasons of trees with leaves and without, snowy conditions, everything looks beautiful in this film. Interesting use of muted colors when the film shifts to Hachi's perspective, as the filmmaker tries to show things through Hachi's eyes.  Overall, very good picture quality for this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is features an English 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless audio track.  The majority of the film is dialogue driven and thus front and center channel driven but there are a few moments in the film such as a cold windstorm in which you hear rickety noises and wood and object clanging in the background that utilizes the surround channels.  Also, scenes that feature the train running through the train tracks by Hachi is also captured quite well through the surround channels.  Overall, a satisfactory lossless soundtrack for this type of film.

Subtitles are in English and English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Hachi"" comes with the following special features in High Definition with English Stereo:

  * A Bondy of Loyalty - The Making of Hachi: A Dog's Tale - (17:50) A featurette on the making of the film.  Interviews with the talents and why Richard Gere took the role, working with the dogs that played Hachi and more.
  * Previews - Sony Pictures Home Entertainment trailers
  * BD-Live Enabled

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Hachi"" definitely caught my attention when I first saw the trailer.  I've always been interested in the story of Hachiko and it was definitely one of my priorities during my first trip to Tokyo and wanting to see the actual bronze statue of the dog.  Needless to say, when I first heard an American adaptation to the Hachiko tale, especially when there was the film""Hachiko Monogatari"" in 1987 which was a very good film, I was not sure what to expect from ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"".

But after watching the film, I was very touched and I have to say that they captured that bond between an owner and a dog, the love for a dog by its owner and most of all, that touching loyalty of the original Hachiko story in this film.

It's quite interesting to see Richard Gere in such a film, because you don't expect him in this type of film.  You expect him to take on romantic lead roles or authoritative figures but to see him as a dog lover/owner definitely shows a new light for him as an actor and also, I found it quite intriguing to see the reunion of Gere and Jason Alexander since their pairing back in the 1990 film ""Pretty Woman"".  But the film also features star talents such as Joan Allen, Erick Avari, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and you have a talented director with Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.  But more surprising to me that Sony gave this film a very limited release despite having a well-known director and talent behind the film and pretty much made ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" a direct-to-video release.  I wish they would have given this film a chance because it's a very good film with a solid performance by Richard Gere especially with his interaction with Hachi (you're not going to see many films with Richard Gere with a tennis ball in his mouth, while trying to teach a dog how to play fetch).

Granted, when it comes to canine films especially with a well-known story about Hachiko the dog, I can understand if people are hesitant after seeing tearjerkers such as ""Quill"" or even ""Marley & Me"".  It's a very touching film and pays its respect quite well to the original Japanese story based on the real story about Professor Hidesaburo Ueno and his Akita, Hachiko.

Overall, ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is an enjoyable and touching film that will make you laugh and cry and a film definitely worth watching!",1268179200,25,6776,4.738277919863598
4055007,5,B0031RAOVY,"Honestly, I might need an i.v. to rehydrate.  What a touching beautiful film about a dog and its undying devotion for its master.  If your dog could talk, he'd want you to watch this. I gave mine a belly rub and an extra treat afterwards.
For the ladies out there...it's a no-brainer. You have both Richard Gere and a puppy in this movie.  Enough said.",1268092800,36,352,4.384615384615385
4055008,5,B0031RAOVY,"This film is wonderfully shot, includes subtle symbolism in the scenes (hint: look at the train station decorations and time on the clock near the very end of the movie) and is probably the most pure, simple and emotional movie I have ever seen.

I don't understand why this great film was not promoted more and/or did not get a good solid American release.  I would not even have known about it unless I saw it on the New Releases for Blockbuster.  It was filmed in early 2008, released in Japan in August 2009 ..... then simply placed on the ""Direct to DVD"" market here in the USA.  I never heard anything about this movie even being made until stumbling across it by chance luck.

A great and well done movie like this deserved better promotion and press treatment.  It is a shame because many people may miss out on this film.

I can only guess that budget over runs and limited financing left no money in the budget for advertising after the filming was done ?  Anybody know ?

Or are American audience now only fascinated with fancy CGI visual effects ""eye candy"" and no story ?

In either case ... This movie deserved and still deserves more attention !

So on to the movie itself ...

A tough guy like me does not usually get choked up over movies, but here is one I can recommend to you that will probably touch you.

It is based on a true story from Japan ... although this version with Richard Gere has been shifted to USA.

Basically this is the story if you don't already know it.

WARNING SPOILER BELOW ........
.........
............
..........

A college professor had a dog that was loyal to him.
Each day it would follow him to the train station where he left for work.
The dog would run around and do whatever all day long.
But at 5:00 in the evening the dog was always back at the train station to meet his owner.
This went on for years,

One day the dog was waiting at the train station, but the professor never showed up.
The professor had died of a heart attack at the school campus that day.

For the next 9 years, the dog kept waiting and looking for it's owner at the train station everyday.
Other people would try to take the dog home, but every time the dog would run away and return to the train station trying to wait for the professor.
He became a local legend and the other people at the train station each day would bring the dog food and water to take care of him since the dog refused to leave his post.

Eventually 9 years later the dog died, still sitting at the train station watching the people get off every train, looking for his owner.

Today in Japan where this really happened they have a bronze statue of the dog sitting in the train station as a tribute to that kind of loyalty.

.........

END OF SPOILER

I suppose the reason I found this particular story touching enough to even put a lump in my throat was two reasons ..

1)  I have always thought there is something innocent and pure about an animals loyalty and affections that is rare in humans.

2)  When I was young and walking to elementary school, my friend had a dog named Pal.
He would follow us when we walked the 2 miles to school.

He would wait for us all day long.
I can remember sitting in classes and looking out the window and seeing that dog under a tree looking at the school building and waiting for us to get out.

When we got out of class in the afternoon he would be all excited and come running to meet us and follow us home again.

This went on for around 2 years as I recall.
But one day when we got out of school, the dog was all excited to see us and came running across the parking lot.
We started yelling ""NO PAL. STOP""
But it did not help.
Pal ran in front of a school bus in the parking lot.

Now being older and wiser, I look back at this story from childhood and think ..........

Yes, it is a cute story about boys and their dogs growing up together.
But the real world is not the 1800 or early 1900s of farmhouses, dirt roads and horse & buggies anymore.
The world is an urban , mechanized jungle that is dangerous for loosely roaming animals.
If people really care about their animals they should not let them run around loose all day long to get hit by cars or other dangers.

This is one of those rare movies you see in life that will leave an impression.

Well done to everybody who worked on this project !",1268006400,9,4378,4.247584541062802
4055009,5,B0031RAOVY,"Forget about MARLEY AND ME. HACHI is a more emotional, honest, and altogether more poignant film about the relationship between a man who adopts a young Akita pup and the bond that develops that between them. It is sad, but in a good way, and even though it has a G rating, it's a more powerful film than MARLEY AND ME, which had some objectionable adult content and a melodramatic, saccharine script. HACHI is superior to it in terms of its filmmaking and central story, a credit to director Lasse Hallstrom (CHOCOLAT) who has made some wonderful movies and adds yet another to his resume here.

Richard Gere is sensitive and wonderful, the Rhode Island location shooting and the low-key script all combine to create a fabulous film suitable for all ages.

Don't miss it -- and be prepared not only to have some kleenexes on-hand (my wife and I both broke down!), but also to do some research into the ""real"" Hachi once it's over, as this is based on a legendary true story that happened in Japan in the 1920s.

4055010,5,B0031RAOVY,"Okay, it's not hip to love films that rely so much on sentiment, but...damn, I loved this movie!  The script is a polished, clean work of high-level craftsmanship, and the acting by all the humans is high caliber as well.  It is the dog (s), in the character of Hachi, who brings it all home, of course.  I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the ""toy"" breeds, although they can be cute).  It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).

The plot is truly simple: abandoned dog finds man, Parker Wilson, at train station, wins over man with it's charm and cuteness.  Man's wife, Cate, tries to interfere with the friendship/bonding process (don't all wives?), by demanding he not adopt another dog.  Man's love for dog wins out, and wife relents. The rest of the movie focuses mostly on the bonding of Parker and Hachi, with small scenes of interaction between Parker's family (wife Cate, daughter Andy, and soon-to-be son-in-law, Michael), moving through life, interacting with each other and Hachi.  And Hachi's penchant for leaving the backyard, on his own, and walking to the train station
(everyday at the same time) to wait for Parker and walk home with him.  Then a poignant story development takes place, setting the stage for theme of the movie.
The event itself won't necessarily put a lump in your throat: but the things that happen immediately after...and for the remaining 24 minutes of film definitely will.  Unless 1)you've been disconnected from the life-support system, or 2) You're one of those insufferable guys who feel they are too manly to admit they have emotions or too high-brow and sophisticated to be taken in by popular entertainment and ""cheap sentiment.""  (Funsuckers).  If those don't apply, be prepared to tell any women in the room that, you, um...got some dust in your eyes, or something.

The script/screen story is based on a real-life story, only it has been Americanized.  That's okay.  The story still hits home.  And the dogs which were used for this movie are brilliant actors!  The cutesy angle (often used in films that feature dogds) is largely avoided; and the idea, when showing things from Hachi's persepective, to use some faded colors, instead of black & white, was spot-on.  I have to admit, I generally enjoy the majority of Lasse Halstrom's work ""The Cider House Rules,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" etc).  This is no exception.

4055011,5,B0031RAOVY,"Based on the true story of a loyal and faithful Japanese dog, this film Americanizes the version of the 1930s events. This doesn't seem to hurt the story as much as it would generally and this is mainly because the story is in the skillful hands of Lasse Hallstrm.

Beautifully filmed from the human perspective, Hallstrm also films part of the film from the dog's perspective, making sure that the scenes are in black and whites hues and are shot from the level the dog would see them from. The film works as a homage to the loyalty and friendship and the testament of the bond shared between the professor (played by Richard Gere) and the dog who finds him (played by a series of Akitas). Joan Allen is also quite convincing as a wife who refuses to take in a dog (in fact, Hachi spends his time ""being part of the family"" by living in a shed outside) and, later, as a grieving wife who stumbles upon the dog who still patiently waits for his master to return for nine years.

The movie is done with authentic admiration and faithful devotion - the story never veers into the melodramatic; instead it receives a heartfelt and touching treatment. This means that, in the way of all good dog movies, you will laugh AND you will cry, making Hachi: A Dog's Tale a worthwhile retelling of Hachiko's story.",1267315200,17,1302,4.489451476793249

4055013,5,B0031RAOVY,"As a grown man not prone to crying, by the end of this film I was a blubbering mess, and I've probably not shed a tear in more than ten years. Anyone who loves dogs, I imagine, will be in the same state after witnessing the amazing loyalty displayed by one selfless canine.

I'd actually heard the story many times.  A loyal dog returns to train station to meet his master even after he dies. But the film really brings the point home following the entire life span of the dog.  But what I feel makes this film stand out is how it shows the perspective of the dog, a great reminder that ""Hachi"" is the protagonist in the film and giving insight into the emotions he felt.  Additionally, the dog was portrayed as a dog, not a human character in a dog suit capable of impossible feats and acts, which for me, made the story so much more enjoyable and made the dog so much more believable.

Please disregard the one-star rating given by the Akita breeder in Nevada who didn't really rate the film so much as criticize peoples tendency to purchase dogs because of movie influences. It should also be noted that the Japanese Akita as a breed would have most likely disappeared had it not been for the original Hachi's popularity in Japan during the 1930's when the story was popularized by local newspapers of the time.

I would rate this as probably the best dog movie ever to come out of Hollywood.  If you've made it so far as to read reviews, you really should just buy it. I can't imagine any dog lover being disappointed in this magnificent film.",1265587200,614,1547,4.4070175438596495

8387186,1,B0031RAOVY,"First of all, this movie is a horrible text book example of WHITE WASHING! It's a Japanese tale so it should be Japanese or Asian actors! Asian actors are very underrepresented in Hollywood, so why take away an opportunity for them to shine?!  Plenty of Americans of all ethnicities are interested in seeing stories featuring actors from different countries and cultures. Anyone who won't see a movie unless it contains a famous white actor, or a cast of white actors is an ignorant racist. Plain and simple.

But that's not even the worst part of this movie. Richard Gere does a terrible job. It's a role not meant for him and his poor acting in this film is similar to a card board cut out. Also, why did they change the story? It's a story about one humans bond with one canine, but this movie turns it into a trite family drama. Very lame.

I rented the movie from my local library thank God. I'm pretty familiar with various Japanese breeds, in particular the intelligent spitz breeds especially the large and loyal Akita. . .this movie is a poor portrayal of Japanese spitz breeds Akitas and of the original story, Hachiko.",1528588800,,1129,4.606965174129353
