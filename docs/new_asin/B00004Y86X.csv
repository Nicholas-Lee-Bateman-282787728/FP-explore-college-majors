7927069,5,B00004Y86X,"A great movie starting with first sighting in 1947 through the 1950's that deals with facts. Written and starring the individuals who experienced the UFO's at that time, this is truly an excellent movie, unfortunately, rarely seen on television today. Well worth the price from a great seller!",1517875200,,293,5.125
7927070,5,B00004Y86X,"This documentary is an incredible presentation of the incredible phenomenon of UFOs. This is a non-fictional account, with photographic evidence which was reviewed by the U.S military/government, and which remains as unknown to this day. As Al Chop noted in this film, if the objects aren't birds, atmospheric inversions or anomalies, or any aircraft known to man, then the only conclusion that could be made by him and the military/government, is that they are from somewhere else other than Earth.",1453507200,,499,5.25
7927071,5,B00004Y86X,"This is the first UFO film and ably shot in a docu-drama style. It retells real events about a real character - Al Chop, a 1950s newspaper reporter who is asked by the Air Force to head their new public affairs desk. He begins with an open mind but slowly changes his views about the reality of UFOs.

The final actual UFO film clips released by the Air Force are still some of the best seen and makes one think too. I enjoy watching this film at least once a year and I am a skeptic.

The famous 1950s Washington D.C. Capitol UFO flap is the film's big climax. Very interesting and engaging UFO docu-drama from the 1950s that should be seen by anyone interested in UFOs - whether a believer or skeptic.",1403654400,,703,4.2781954887218046
7927072,3,B00004Y86X,"The story of Al Chop, Public Information Officer during the 1952 apparent Washington airspace invasion. It covers the Thomas Mantell incident, the Chiles-Whitted sighting, the George Gorman reported UFO dogfight, plus includes the footage and some analysis of the Utah and Montana amateur UFO footage, discussed in Donald Keyhoe's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flying-saucers-from-outer-space/dp/B0007DECOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flying saucers from outer space</a>.

The makers could and arguably should have included more material and increased the pedestrian pace of this drama-documentary.

The segment on the Mantell incident contradicts what Cpt. Ruppelt writes in his Report on UFOs, in which he states that Mantell chased a skyhook balloon to his death.

A good sense of drama is conveyed in the climax, with unidentified blips at one point homing in on a lone interceptor in the skies above Washington.

Nothing on Roswell. The Kenneth Arnold sighting is covered, but is stated that Arnold stated he saw ""saucer shaped objects."" That's untrue. The craft Arnold observed are on the cover of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Coming-of-the-Saucers/dp/0964499711/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Coming of the Saucers</a>: a type of flying wing.

7927073,4,B00004Y86X,"An honest compendium of 1950s UFO sightings presented in a docu-drama style.  The film is dated but all of the witnesses associated with the original sightings appeared to me to be credible.  Ordinary people winessing extraordinary things.  The film quality was very good for the time - crisp black and white footage.  I found the Tremonton, Utah footage the most compelling - a very credible observer recounting multiple silver discs directly overhead travelling at a high rate of speed.  If you have any interest in the UFO enigma this is a film you should see.",1338768000,2,563,4.88421052631579
7927074,5,B00004Y86X,I saw this on late night TV years ago this one of my all time favorites. It is great that this little gem is available.,1337040000,,119,3.8
7927075,5,B00004Y86X,"This movie -- amazinglhy enough -- is like a real-life version of ""The X-Files"".  Los Angles report Al Chop does what  FBI agent Fox Mulder did in the famous TV show, seeking the truth that he knows is out there.
The fact that this film is based on facts which are verifiable through the government and various respectible agencies makes the movie very interesting and enjoyable to watch.
Well worth the meager price -- and the time it take to watch a film that dares to tell us the facts about things we are afraid to know.",1028505600,9,524,4.391752577319588
7927076,5,B00004Y86X,"Trivia question for sci-fi fans: name the 1956 film that featured the talents of Les Tremayne (the general in `War of the Worlds' and the opening narrator of `Forbidden Planet'), Marvin Miller (the voice of Robby the Robot in `Forbidden Planet'), Olan Soule (who had a supporting role in `The Day the Earth Stood Still' and `Captain Midnight'), and Harry Morgan (Colonel Porter of `M.A.S.H.'). Here's a hint: Harry Morgan plays an Air Force pilot whose plane is surrounded by six flying saucers above the Washington, D.C.
If all this sounds too good to be true, take a peak at this drama-documentary, based on the experiences of Al Chop, a reporter who served as press liaison for the Pentagon during its investigation of UFO's from 1947 to the early 1950s. Miller, Soule, and Tremayne provide the voices for the narrated portions of the film. Although the movie contains only two brief film clips to serve as photographic evidence of UFO's, the producers build a good case based on the credibility of certain UFO witnesses (airline pilots, military personnel, radar operators, etc.).
On a more subtle level, director Winston Jones pulls off a clever trick; he begins the film as a pure documentary, but he gradually modifies this approach and focuses on reporter Al Chop's personal involvement in the UFO investigation. Chop slowly changes from UFO skeptic to UFO believer (and so will you). The climax is a gripping reenactment of a true incident which occurred in 1950, when a group of UFO's cruised above Washington DC for several hours. The voice of Harry Morgan is heard over the radio as an Air Force pilot whose plane is literally surrounded by UFO's, during which Al Chop and a group of bewildered military men cluster around the radar scope, watching in wide-eyed wonder. Dramatically speaking, this scene is far superior to its counterpart in `Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.
The most amazing thing about this film is the fact that it was made with the full cooperation of the United States government, and every scrap of evidence it presents was made available to any and all scientific agency who wanted to examine it. Watch it and make up your own mind about UFO's -- but you'll loose some sleep over it before you do. Note: Some reviews mistakenly identify the star of `Unidentified Flying Objects' as Tom Powers, a co-star of `Destination Moon' (1950). The star of `UFO' is actually a Los Angles newspaper reporter (not a professional actor) named Tom Powers, who portrays the real-life reporter Al Chop.",980467200,13,2525,4.901869158878505
