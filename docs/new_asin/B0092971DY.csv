8534687,4,B0092971DY,"""Ruddigore"" has been my favorite G&S opera for more than half a century. I have lost count of the number of productions I have seen, live or recorded, and mightily enjoyed all but two. This is among the ones I have mightily enjoyed.
The DVD is an amateur recording of an amateur production, and not to be judged by the technical standards of, say, the Eric Idle ""Mikado."" At the same time, the word ""amateur"" is rooted in the Latin for ""love."" Entering the mindset of actually being in the live audience should, I think, repay the effort.
This Austin production uses the original overture, as well as the often-cut numbers it features: ""The Battle's Roar Is Over"" and the ""When a man has been a naughty baronet"" Finale verses. (Alas, they do not re-insert ""Uncommonly Dear at the Price."") I found the Rose particularly charming, and the Robin reminded me a few times -- I can't think why -- of Leonard, the most nearly normal male of ""The Big Bang Theory"" gang, though thinner and with longer hair. I have never seen a better Robin in the agony scene: agonized and funny both at once.
I have no hesitation at all in recommending this one over the slick but gimmicky Brent Walker version.",1358294400,,1187,4.5514018691588785
