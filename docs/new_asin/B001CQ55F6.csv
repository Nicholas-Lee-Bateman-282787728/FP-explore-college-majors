3515489,4,B001CQ55F6,"This set continues the adventures of the Smurfs where Volume one left off.  The DVD's even have the same issue where the volume of the menu is so much louder then the actual episodes.  These episodes still have the ""good / bad"" voice over opening.  Hopefully Season 2 will be out soon and have the ""Total Destruction From Mountain To Shore"" opening that I and my friends remember from Saturday Mornings in the '80s.",1225670400,2,415,4.581081081081081
3515490,5,B001CQ55F6,"The diminutive blue beings known as the Smurfs are finally back on a brand new 2-disc set with 20 classic cartoons of the second half of the first season restored and rejuvenated for fans of all ages.

With the likes of Papa, Brainy, Hefty, Grouchy, Lazy, Handy, Greedy, Dreamy, and Smurfette, there's never a dull moment in their tiny Smurf village hidden deep within the forest.  Of course, there are many horrific dangers and vile creatures beyond the forest.  Especially that wicked warlock Gargamel and his conniving cat Azrael who desperately try to catch those Smurfs at any and every way possible.  Still, no matter what the danger, the Smurfs come out on top if they all put their minds together as one.

Along with these new-to-DVD adventures, there's a super-cool special feature called ""I Smurf the Smurfs"" where celebrities and people who worked on the show, like writers and voices from the show, discuss the origin of the hit series and how it became a smurfy sensation for years to come.

You can bet that these little creatures still have their magic touch as they have touched the hearts of millions worldwide.  Hopefully, the rest of the hit series will be smurfing to DVD real smurf - er, I mean, soon !  (I really gotta stop talking like that.)",1223856000,11,1265,4.718181818181818

Continue the first season of this Emmy-winning animated series with The Smurfs - Season One, Volume Two.

This 2-disc (320 min.) set features 20 digitally remastered and uncut episodes (complete with original broadcast version title screens); Full Frame (1.33:1) video; English Mono audio; English subtitles; plus the following Special Feature:

""I Smurf the Smurfs!"" - Featurette explores the origin and creation of the characters to the marketing of the toys and also examines the popularity of the series thru interviews with writers Marc Scott Zicree and Mel Gilden and voice talents Lucille Bliss (Smurfette), Danny Goldman (Brainy Smurf) and legendary June Foray (Jokey Smurf).

3515510,5,B001CQ55F6,"This is the best cartoon series ever created.  The voices, sound effects, the classic story lines that include moral lessons.  You just can't find quality like this anymore.  It's not just my opinion, my kids 3-10 years old begged me to get volume 2.  These 2 disc sets are nice quality.  I can't believe that whoever owns the rights has not released more seasons.  With the right marketing they could make a fortune!  The other  Smurf DVD sets out there with random episodes are not a good value.  They would sell like hotcakes if they released more complete season DVD's.",1431388800,,573,4.65

3515537,3,B001CQ55F6,"The only one set I will buy other than the first half of the first season because of the value... The other releases are horrible! 5 episodes, you won't catch me buying them.  I also bought Smurfs two Christmas specials.  Which that is a bit different.  People buy other single Christmas specials, so why not the smurfs?",1386806400,,320,4.578947368421052

3515539,4,B001CQ55F6,"My kids like the Smurfs as much as I did as a kid.  I like the way it's broken down, 12 chapters with 2 or 3 little shows in each.  That helps me budget their TV time.  As for content, it's not as gentle and G rated as we're used to from PBS and Disney Junior.  It's from the early 80's.  Smurfet says ""boo hoo"" and ""poor me"" a lot (not a super strong female role model) and Grumpy Smurf walks around saying I hate this or I hate that all the time (words we don't like to use in our house), but sometimes I think we keep this generation of kids a little too sheltered.  The Smurfs work together well as a team.  They are a supportive family.  Papa Smurf is always working on new potions which my 5 year old loves.  He likes to take kitchen ingredients and make potions too.  I'll probably purchase volume 3.  I find it harmless and entertaining.",1378944000,,845,4.091463414634147
