5613471,5,B00BF59Z9Q,"The final set of the first season of Pokmon Black and White has once again proven to be a satisfying entry into the long-running series; based on the video games of the same name. This set covers the episodes ""A Fishing Connoisseur in a Fishy Competition"" (aired here after its delay because of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake)"" through ""Battle for The Underground."" The DVD captures the sound and picture quality in great detail; and is highly recommended for young children and fans of the series.",1408320000,,494,4.823529411764706

5613473,5,B00BF59Z9Q,"This is the fourth 12 episode set of Pokemon Black and White. They are:

37: A Fishing Connoisseur in a Fishy Competition!
38: Movie Time! Zorua in The Legend of the Pokmon Knight!
39: Reunion Battles in Nimbasa!
40: Cilan Versus Trip, Ash Versus Georgia!
41: The Club Battle Hearts of Fury: Emolga Versus Sawk!
42: The Club Battle Finale: A Heroes Outcome!
43: Meowth's Scrafty Tactics!
44: Purrloin: Sweet or Sneaky?
45: Beheeyem, Duosion, and the Dream Thief!
46: The Beartic Mountain Feud!
47: Crisis from the Underground Up!
48: Battle for the Underground!

This set contains many episodes with awesome battle scenes, especially the tournament in Nimbasa Town (not Nimbasa City). It also has a larger Team Rocket plot (Meowth joins Ash and friends for a while) build up and unfold, finally ending in the Subway in Nimbasa City with the Subway Masters included as well. However, there are no new gym badges obtained.

The set itself is similar to the other sets in that it contains 12 episodes, has no extras, and is nicely done in widescreen. This time it has Zorua and Purrloin on the discs (Oshawott and Snivy are on the first set, Tepig and Pansage are on the second set, and Emolga and Excadrill are on the third set). Overall, another very good set with a VERY good price.",1368576000,4,1282,4.688888888888889
