5242383,5,B0091MW50G,"This is a sampler; it contains one selection each from most,, but not all, of the complete Verdi operas being released by C Major/Unitel Classica between now and next Spring. Since buying the entire series involves a substantial cash outlay over time, the disc gives the potential buyer a limited opportunity to evaluate performances because most excerpts feature one performer. On the plus side, disc quality in this series seems to be first rate, with all operas being made from an HD master, with very fine surround sound, and subtitles in ""E, F, Sp, I, Chin, Kor, Jap"". Some operas will be first time DVDs while others face varying levels of competition from existing discs.

All operas are performed by the Teatro Regio di Parma, a tough venue for singers, since the Parmigiani are a very demanding bunch in the audience. Some performances are done in the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Busetto, a venue I like a lot since it seats only 300 and the stage is about 30 m deep. Orchestral work and choral work are first rate through the entire series. The performances are essentially ""Italian"" with an obvous respect for the music and a totally enthusiastic audience, even to the point of a ""Viva Verdi!!""at the end of ""Va pensiero"". Oh yes; and some motivation for a Weight Watchers franchise in Parma. All of this makes for some splendid enjoyment at home!

I have received viewed and reviewed two of the first three (I already have a good Nabucco), Oberto and Il Giorno di Regno. The next three, Ernani, I Lombardi and I due Foscari have been ordered and I intend to review them after seeing them. All are very promising from the excerpts here. Below are some comments:

Nabucco  --  Nucci, Theodossiou, Zanelatto. Moving ""Va pensiero"".

I Lombardi  --  De Biasio, Pertusi, Theodossiou, Meli. Duet, ""Come poteva un angelo"", shows Meli doing very well.

Ernani  -- Berti, Guelfi, Neves, Prestia.  Trio, ""Tu se' Ernani"" is energetic, and although I am not a fan of Susan Neves, this is a must buy in order to get a decent Ernani.

I due Foscari  --  Nucci, DeBiasio, Serjan, Tagliavini. Aria from last act shows Nucci in top form.

Giovanna D'Arco  --  Bowers, Bruson, Vassilieva. ""O fatidica foresta"" shows Vassilieva in very good form, but Bruson's presence is a concern, since he is now past 70.

Attila --  Parodi, Catana, Branchini, DeBiasio. Chorus and entry of Attila is very promising.

Macbeth  --  Nucci,Valayre, Lori, Juliano. Faces very stiff competition from at least two existing discs. Nucci does very well both musically and dramatically in ""fatal mia donna"". Lady MacB is also the real deal both vocally and dramatically. Probable buy, since Macbeth was my first operatic experience.

I Masnadieri  --  Neither cast info nor excerpt.

Il Corsaro  --  Ribiero, Lungu, Salsi, Dalla Benetta. Dalla Benetta rocks in ""Vola talor dal carcere"".

La Battaglia di Legnano  --  Neither cast info nor excerpt.

Luisa Miller  --  Surian, Alvarez, Franci, Nucci.  Alvarez does a bang up ""Quando le sere al placido"".

Stiffelio  --  Aronica, Guanqun, Frontalli.  No excerpt.

Rigoletto  --  Demuro, Machaidze, Nucci, Iranyi. While there is a lot of competiton, overall quality of singing and staging make this must buy for your humble reviewer. Yowza! Quartet is excerpt and it rocks!

Il Trovatore  --  Sgura, Romano, Nioradze, Alvarez.  ""Di Quella pira"" shows Alvarez in better form than in the recent Met release, but the Met version trumps.

La Traviata  --  Vassileva, Giordano, Stoyanov. Who needs another Traviata? (ME!!) Stoyanov does a moving ""Di provenza"".

I Vespri Siciliani  --  Nucci, Armiliato, Prestia, Dessi. A must buy for me. Dessi rocks in ""Merche dillete amiche"".

Simon Boccanegra  --  Nucci, Scanduizzi, Plazzola, Iveri, Meli. Faces some stiff competition but from ""Plebe! Patrizi"", this looks like a winner.

Un Ballo in Maschera  --  Meli, Stoyanov, Lewis, Fiorillo, Gamberoni. Meli in tenor aria is quite good.

La Forza del destino  --  Theodossiou, Stoyanov, Machado, Pentcheva. Theodossiou does a ravishing ""Pace, pace mio Dio"" Promising.

Aida  --  Pentcheva, Branchini, Fraccaro. Triumphal March is cool but hard to evaluate singers.

No info, no excerpts on  Don Carlo, but faces huge competition from either Alagna or Villazon version.

No info or excerpts from Otello.

Falstaff  --  Maestri, Salsi, Vasselieva, Gandia. Finale looks promising but I am not a fan of Falstaff.

So, gentle reader, that's the lineup. Watch pricing: Amazon offer excellent pre-release deal at $20.99 ( so far) but bumps to $35 as time passes. Early bird and all that.",1350432000,21,4582,5.0013297872340425

8534368,5,B0091MW50G,"This is a pretty nice intro to the Box set and it gives you some idea of the production and vocal values of some of the operas. I wish we could have seen more of the lesser known opera like Alzira, I Masnadieri etc. instead of the old war horses which have many different DVD's available.

Just from seeing this single DVD I can honestly say that the box set is NOT worth buying - some of the individual operas are - especially ones like Alzira - but most of the War Horses are available in better productions with famous singers.

These operas are all set in small provincial opera houses and some of the staging is minimalist at best. The Il Trovatore staging was not only awful but so was the singing. I didn't got for the White Bed, Candles and Red Moon for Di Quella Pira. I suggest if you want that opera get either the Met version with Pavarotti or the TDK with Domingo. Both are better sung, and the Domingo is the well stages - the Met is pretty poor staging.

The Ernani is poor - not just the staging but the singers - if you want this opera, get the Met version with Pavarotti.

Nevertheless for all my criticims and saying there are better DVD's of the individual operas out there - getting this single DVD will give you some idea of which operas you might want to buy invididually in this series or from other labels with better singers and productions.

But above all this DVD indicates that the BOX Set at $700+ dollars is not worth it since many of the operas are poorly staged and have at best B+ singers.",1355788800,10,1523,4.274305555555555

8534370,1,B0091MW50G,"I just got this disc, and was preparing to enjoy ""Va Pensiero"". My Sony Player announced the disc as unplayable.
The description says region a-1 & b-2.  I have never heard of a 2 region disc, just one region or all region. I suspect this disc is only B-2 {European} and will not play on American players. Any way I am out 9.99, as the value of the disc does not make it cost effective to return, and a replacement will not likely work either. I guess it was a bargain just too good to be true.",1354665600,4,493,4.082474226804123
8534371,2,B0091MW50G,"I have a considerably lower opinion of this disk than John Gleason in another review, but am deeply indebted to him for his careful and detailed analysis, which was the reason for my purchase. I paid around 9 dollars from a reseller, and feel it was worth it, but if this disk had been much more expensive, I'd have felt cheated and would say to others to hold off. I found five or six of the excerpts at ""Met level"" or thereabouts, but the others considerably less strong. Beyond that something Mr. Gleason doesn't comment on is the production value of the video (not the staging, but the sound and photography). (By the way, all of my references are to the Blu-Ray version, which is the one I bought.) It was a real disappointment to me. E.g., the quartet at the end of Rigoletto did not utilize the potential of modern individual miking technology to bring out individual voices/harmonies/vocal interactions. I have no idea how it was miked (radio or whatever), but I have heard many Blu-Ray disks with better, sharper sound production--both recording and mixing. (I checked my DAC and the disk was, indeed, recorded at 48/24, but, for whatever reason, it just doesn't sound a whole lot better than 44.1/16--CD quality--to my highly trained ears; and that's not mentioning the aforementioned miking and mixing issues--where voices are not adequately separated or the levels of different voices, or voices and the orchestra, matched and carefully adjusted in post-production.) Ditto on the same sort of production problems in the visuals. Not only were the productions not lighted for high-resolution video (easy to do and still produce a work on stage in front of an audience), but many of the shot selections (closeups on buttons on a performer's costume or a performer's legs rather than face, etc.) are downright bizarre. (Probably trying to cover for missing material where another cameraman didn't shoot the assigned face.) In short, I approached this disk with the highest hopes and expectations, fully ready to be persuaded that I should buy the whole set when it appears, but I have to say I made the opposite decision as I watched, deciding that ""no, this is not the set I want to mortgage my house to obtain."" Too bad. Verdi needs great productions, and great Blu-Rays for those of us who don't live in New York, Paris, or London. But in my humble opinion, this is not what we were waiting for. I wish I could have been more enthusiastic. (A suggestion for any ""newbies"" out there who are just looking for an opera aria compilation Blu-Ray for themselves or a present for a friend. Search Amazon for ""Anna Netrebko"" (a soprano) and ""opera concert"" and ""Blu-Ray."" She and friends have two amazing concert disks from around 2006 or 2007. The better of the two is an indoor concert and the other, only very slightly less amazing, is an outdoor concert. I forget which cities, but you should be able to find both easily by searching with the three terms I have given. If you are thinking of buying the Verdi disk just as a kind of ""sampler"" to get your feet wet in opera, you would do far better, in fact you would have your mind blown and your soul transported, by the Netrebko Blu-Rays, both exceptional in all three areas: performance, sound, and photography. Truly exceptional.)",1353888000,16,3291,4.765323992994746
