2576233,5,B000FMGTV2,"when I bought this dvd, my expectations were high concerning the ""laughing intensity"" while watching it. I can only say I laughed and I admired Tim Allen's strong personality. I mean to stand up in front of such a big mass of people and to talk, confortable with your own self, as if you are telling jokes among friends, this is amazing. Also, the creativity of showing differences between men and women, in ""tool language"", that was cool. Thanks Tim Allen!",1215043200,,457,4.654320987654321
2576234,5,B000FMGTV2,"Tim Allen in the concerts that launched his career. Not for the kids, but definitely a belly-buster for the adults.  Man stuff at its finest - tools and tips from the master of home improvement disaster.  It also includes a recent interview made just for the DVD that's well worth the watch. Check it out.  You won't be sorry (sore, maybe, from laughing so much, but definitely not sorry).",1200268800,,389,4.608695652173913
2576235,1,B000FMGTV2,"I was really disappointed by this dvd. I love Tim Allen and I love ""Home Improvement"" and that's why I got this dvd. I could barely sit through the first performance. It was sooo bad and extremely boring. I couldn't even bring myself to watch the second show. It might've been better but I honestly didn't want to waste anymore of my time.",1179014400,,339,4.396825396825397
2576236,5,B000FMGTV2,"That's right!  Tim Allen is truely one of the BEST.  This DVD includes his 2 classic Showtime masterpieces, Men Are Pigs and Rewires America. In which you'll hear the original routines from the Tool Man that inspired Home Improvement.  Also included on this disc is a very informative interview with Tim Allen and a never released 5 minute short film, Docu-comic.  If you're a fan if Tim Allen, or just stand up comedy, this DVD is for you.",1156723200,19,440,4.602564102564102
2576237,5,B000FMGTV2,"I was in the audience at The Power Center in Ann Arbor when ""Rewires America"" was filmed. We laughed from start to finish and later bought the show on vhs. When I read about this edition, I couldn't wait to get it. ""Rewires America"" is even funnier than I remember. ""Men Are Pigs"" and the docu-comic are hilarious as well. Pure early Tim Allen. Highly recommend!",1152144000,15,362,4.5
2576238,5,B000FMGTV2,This is one of the funniest stand up routines I have ever seen in my life and am so glad I found it so I can watch it anytime i want,1366156800,,132,3.2903225806451615
2576239,5,B000FMGTV2,Tim Allen is one of my favorite comedians and TV personalities.  I remember watching these standup shows as a child with my cousin and laughing throughout them all.  It was great to find them on DVD to make sure that my children are able to appreciate the comedians of my time when they are old enough to understand the jokes.,1359849600,,326,4.416666666666667
2576240,4,B000FMGTV2,"Tim Allen was always delivers a refreshing narrative about things that men can associate with. From vacumming to upgrading the motor in a lawn mower, crockery to verps, he candidly mocks all things married and men. Yeah, between the two routines he repeats some of his lines, but he just has a wonderful relation with the audience. I used to live in Royal Oak. I know the theater he played in, and I know the audience. It brings back wonder memories. I rank him up there with Kathleen Madigan and Richard Jeni (may he rest in peace). When I have a bad day, I will either put Tim on, or Shoot-Em-Up....  either way, it's satisfying.",1352160000,,631,4.48695652173913
2576241,5,B000FMGTV2,"My mom was wanting Tim Allen: Men are Pigs for so long, and I am happy I found this for her!! Two for the price of one; she has watched the disc a lot since it was delivered and I expect it might get worn out eventually.",1347667200,,220,3.702127659574468

2576243,5,B000FMGTV2,This is where it all began for Tim and his Tool Time Show.  Two of the funniest comic acts will ever watch.  You will see many of the themes from the Tool Time series in his jokes.  Enjoy!!!,1263772800,,190,3.9473684210526314
2576244,5,B000FMGTV2,"This is Tim Allen at his best and funniest. If you were only going to buy one comedy routine of his, this would be the one. We were curled up in little balls from laughter. Great to have around and pull out to entertain company.",1229904000,,228,4.088888888888889
2576245,5,B000FMGTV2,"I remembered seeing this stand-up on Showtime when it first came out and it was hysterical.  Well, it hasn't changed over the years.  Still very funny and Tim is just great.  Highly enjoyable.",1224288000,,192,4.757575757575758
2576246,5,B000FMGTV2,These are the two stand up performances that pushed Tim Allen into the limelight for all to see in the early 90's.,1223596800,,114,4.2272727272727275
2576247,2,B000FMGTV2,I did not find anything new as I had watched all the seasons of home improvement. This would be nice introduction  for people to have a feel of Tim's comedy if they are planning to buy home improvement complete seasons set.,1223251200,,223,4.439024390243903
8124640,5,B000FMGTV2,I really like this guy and loved this DVD,1524441600,,41,3.6666666666666665
8124641,5,B000FMGTV2,"Before he starred in Home Improvement, Tim Allen first appeared in the HBO comedy special ""Men Are Pigs"" and that's where his career really began I think.",1521763200,,154,4.7407407407407405
8124642,5,B000FMGTV2,"My dad received this for his birthday. He loved it! For years he'd been saying how sad he was that he'd lost his VHS tape with this stand-up show on it, recorded from HBO years and years ago. He watches this often and howls in laughter as if it was the first time. I'm happy he was so happy with it!",1440547200,,299,3.918032786885246

8124648,4,B000FMGTV2,the item came in a timely manner the only trouble point is that three quarters into the Rewiring America the disk freezes and nothing can move it forward. it plays the total of Men Are Pigs though so is still a nice item just wish both shows played to completion.,1404345600,,263,4.28
