1220481,5,B00000IBM2,"A beautiful sweet film about a young man who strives to do the right thing in a wrong way.....it's kind of corny and simplistic but shows the power that can be found in acts of simple humanity....
A really nice film to share with the entire family..",1227398400,2,249,4.319148936170213

1220483,5,B00000IBM2,"This is a cute, funny and touching drama that you can sit and watch with your entire family ... which is a real treat.

It's not the best movie you'll ever see; but the fact that you can sit and watch it with old and young alike makes up for its short-comings.",1191196800,3,260,4.0
1220484,5,B00000IBM2,I recorded this movie when it originated on TV and it was a hit with my family and friends who borrowed the tape.  We watched it every holiday until someone failed to return it. I've wore out TV Guides every year since  just knowing someone would pick it up and show it during Christmas.  I'm  thrilled it's out on video - we've already watched it twice and I've told  my friends its out.  We appluad those wise enough to know that the audience  is out here.  It will be in my video library - I recommend it for yours!!,933292800,5,519,4.171717171717172

7909892,4,B00000IBM2,"The basic concept of the movie is that Will (who is in his late teens and was adopted) inherits the family farm and the care for his mentally challenged older sister. In order to get help for himself on the farm, and someone for his sister to play with, Will kidnaps two children who need a better life and tells them they died and that the farm is a little piece of heaven. This, of course, does not work out as planned.

The movie is not fancy, but is well made and the acting is good. The closest thing to special effects is the special effects Will puts on to aid in his agenda, which is ""homemade by a teenager"" special effects. The movie is probably best suited for the preteen children but can be enjoyed by the whole family. I don't want to give too much away, but the happy ending is almost fantasy, which the preteen children will be happy to accept.

Suspend reality and accept the movie on its terms and it is fun.

If you have seen and liked ""The Beniker Gang"" staring Andrew McCarthy you will probably also like this movie. Or if you watch this movie and like it, you will probably also like ""The Beniker Gang"". The motives are different, but they have very similar plots, and require similar suspensions of reality. I considered ""The Beniker Gang"" to be the better of the two.",1400889600,,1291,4.348547717842323
7909893,3,B00000IBM2,"My family loved this movie. We love Kirk Cameron. This was made when he was very young. It is cute. It is, however, extremely corny. We don't think anyone would love it unless they like corny movies.",1394928000,,199,4.405405405405405
7909894,3,B00000IBM2,It worked kind of very old so it showed when the movie was played not just in the effects but the quility the tape sometimes screeched like some VHS movies do when they are old and worn. And I bought mine brand new.,1364688000,,215,4.023255813953488
7909895,5,B00000IBM2,"She's a sweet little old lady.

The movie, I have yet to watch. But the idea of kidnapping anyone is disturbing to me. I guess it might be an OK movie.
But for my purposes, I am glad that it was available for sale so I could make an old ladies day.",1354492800,,248,3.769230769230769
7909896,5,B00000IBM2,"I found this movie on Amazon and was thrilled. My parents recorded it for me when I was a kid from TV and my siblings and I grew up watching it. The end made me cry, even as a kid and I think it had a lot to do with influencing me to work with kids in rough neighborhoods. I highly recommend it!",1353888000,,295,3.6984126984126986
7909897,5,B00000IBM2,"This is a great movie. It is sad, funny, uplifting and inspirational. We love watching this at any time of the year.",1324598400,,116,4.318181818181818
