8478558,4,6303953522,"I'd like to see this re-released on DVD. Though it's more than 10 years old, it still has information and entertainment that collectors of the classic Lionel and American Flyer trains, young and old, will enjoy. Tom McComas takes us to the archives of many collectors, lavishly set up and turned on for display! It's only 30 minutes but worth seeing if you're even remotely interested in model trains, a phenomenom that's been around for over a century.",1214870400,2,453,4.82051282051282

However, the layouts  were too busy and were trying to accomplish too much for my taste.  But one  certainly couldn't argue with the quality of workmanship and detail.  All  of these gandydancers should be (and are, I think) proud of their  creations.  The video was well-worth the price.",949708800,13,482,4.7926829268292686
