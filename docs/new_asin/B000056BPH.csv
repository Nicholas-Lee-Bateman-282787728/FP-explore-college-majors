1396377,4,B000056BPH,"I first viewed this film at the Phila L & G Film Festival in the Summer of 2000. A fine film, though the proof picture quality could have been better.  It should be much improved in the final DVD release. The story is a somewhat traditional innocent youth meets older, wiser person and is seduced, falls in love (he thinks), and finds it isn't all it's cracked up to be. In this case, it's a young man (18) and an older man (30s). Typically, there is a young man his own age head-over-heels in love with Jared whom he ignores, but therein is (at least) the drama of the plot. What is so charming about this film is that the characters are simple and portrayed very realistically. You can feel sympathy for Jared immediately and yet feel like you could enjoy getting to know him and some others as well. These young, unknown actors perform exceptionally well.
In a time when (especially independent) movies seek to be offbeat, sometimes just for the sake of being so, it is refreshing to have ""an old-fashioned"" love story. Jared learns some life lessons and we are taken along with him. Director Lance Black does a fine job with a low budget making the film interesting to watch and experience.",981936000,44,1194,4.527777777777778
1396378,1,B000056BPH,"Wow! Here's one for the annals of cinematic embarrassments. Basically, this is a gay ""Lamp Unto My Feet."" It's about a boy who is questioning his sexuality. He arrives by train from Georgia to Los Angeles, checks into a youth hostel, gets kissed by a boy his own age, freaks out, goes to work for a rich blind women..., who has a son in his mid-thirties (although he looks older), who seduces this boy (the boy doesn't freak out when kissed, I presume...). The son in his mid-thirties...,  drinks vodka on the rocks in nearly every scene (even keeps a glass by the bed), has a lover, and wants to bring the boy into his relationship to enliven the flames of passion with his live-in. The son is a rich spoiled brat jerk, but who cares. The boy, appalled at the suggestion of a three-way, eventually goes back to the other guy that freaked him out with a kiss at the hostel after the elderly blnd women tells him to not cash in, but to follow his heart. Yawn.
The script here makes soap operas seem like dramatic masterpieces...",980208000,7,1027,4.4338624338624335

1396384,4,B000056BPH,"This is a delightful movie that I first rented and then eagerly purchased for my collection. I was mesmerized not only by Jared Price's angelic outer beauty, but by his underlying moral fiber which leads him to ultimately make the right decisions for his future. He is able to see through the shallowness of a suitor who promises him the world but has no scruples or concern for his already existing relationship.  In the end, love and honor triumph as Jared gets his priorities right and pursues a relationship with a sweet boy his own age who may not have much to offer materialistically, but who truly cares about him and can bond with him in a wholesome loving relationship.

Like most indie films, this is a low-budget film.  But production values to me are not a primary issue when a story is beautifully written and presented with lots of heart by perfectly cast characters who do a splendid job of making me care about them and root for their happiness and success.

This movie has all the characteristics I relish in a terrific love story with a happy ending.",1378080000,2,1068,4.605263157894737

1396386,5,B000056BPH,"Don't be fooled by this ""little"" film with a tiny budget and cast of relative unknowns.  It has a big heart, eschews melodramatics in favor of genuine emotions,  and will linger in your mind long after the credits role.  It was written and directed by subsequently Oscar-blessed Dustin Lance Black and his future is visible in the pacing and spare dialogue.  The young men are handsome but not precious, nor do they try to be.  There are several soft-core scenes that are rendered without salaciousness.  The truly erotic scene is a simple, flirty wrestle-and-kiss between our hero naif and the young man who loves him.  Even the ""villain"" -- who is no worse than a self-centered jerk -- gets off with a verbal spanking from his mom.

""Journey"" was made in 2000, and could have easily been made yesterday -- with film as with wine, aging well is a function of quality.

1396389,3,B000056BPH,"Considering it's obvious low budget, this is not a bad little film.  The acting, while not superb, is more than
passable, at least let's say most of the performances are somewhat believable.  The storyline is not terribly original, young man comes to the big bad city, takes any job he can find - and gets involved with his boss.  Sounds a little bit like the opening scenes of Valley of the Dolls doesn't it?
This young guy takes a job helping a blind woman around the house.  He is offered room and board in the house as well, but unfortunately gets involved with his employer - tsk tsk, never a good idea.  It turns out that the boss is already involved in a long time relationship, and our young man is dismayed and left feeling used.
I did not care for the quality of the film itself - our character likes to hand video copy everything he sees, as if he is doing his own documentary.  Thus, our movie has this overall greenish hue that one might see if glancing through the lens of a hand held camera.  This effect I suppose was to give one the feeling of being ""there"" with the character.  However, all this effect manages to achieve is to somehow distract one from the storyline.
If you're in the mood for a movie of this type of genre, this film will suffice.",1351296000,,1267,4.338983050847458
1396390,3,B000056BPH,"This is a low budget, simple and well told story. The directing and editing had a lot to do with it; the acting is so-so, but subtle enough not to be terrible. Jared is likable, sweet and innocent, but not cliche. We learn quickly Jared is gay curious and exploring this for the first time. The character's luck is good for a teen striking out on his own for the first time on the streets of Hollywood. Jared arrives in LA with little money and a vague back story. He winds up at a hostel where he rooms with a disposable hustler character and meets another young gay boy who makes a romantic move on Jared. (There is fault in this story with the way things just happen. Nothing implausible, just too happenstance. Better acting would have fixed that.) By virtue of only showing up he lands a job as a caretaker of a wise, wealthy, blind, elderly woman.  The elderly woman's son, Matthew turns out to be a successful older gay man bored with his relationship, who quickly develops intentions for Jared. Matthew's story muddles the point of view a bit, but is well played and features the better acting. It's clumsy but illuminates that character's motivations and fleshes him out a bit. The point of view on Matthew becomes a little confusing. It plays almost sympathetically from the honesty of it, skewing the outcome to feeling a bit misaligned, though not unexpected. All in all, I found this quiet little movie worth the rental.",1336176000,4,1433,4.59765625
1396391,4,B000056BPH,"THE JOURNEY OF JARED PRICE is a small budget Indie that has so much going for it that overlooking the squeaky production values is not a problem. Though it is obvious that the film was made in a short time with a minimal budget (the quality of the film is washed out to almost variations of gray), the direction and the cast serve the screenplay by writer/director Dustin Lance Black well. It has some very fine moments.

Jared Price (Corey Spears), 19 nave years of age, arrives in Los Angeles from Georgia with high hopes and little money and checks into a youth hostel where he meets Robert (Josh Jacobson) who is more than casually attentive to the oblivious but interested Jared, and finds a job as an attendant to blind woman Mrs. Haines (Rocki Craigg), a kind and wise wealthy lonely lady whose son Matthew (Steve Tyler) is 'paying for' someone to give his mother the attention she needs. Jared and Mrs. Haines quickly bond, each supplying the care and tenderness the other needs. Matthew is living the high life on his mother's wealth and is in a long-term (but only partially non-monogamous) relationship with Andrew (Bryan Shyne) and when he meets Jared the signals go up and Matthew introduces Jared to his first physical relationship. Matthew's only conscience is his work partner Kate (Gillian Harris) who warns Matthew to be true to Andrew and not to pursue Jared. But as the tryst between Matthew and Jared deepens, each of the men learns more about himself and what is actually important in life and the story ends with enlightened views of the meaning of love.

Each of the actors does a fine job finding the core of each character and there is enough comedy to keep the drama afloat. Yes, there are scenes of bedroom activity, but they for the most part are done with taste. This is a fine example of how a good story and crew can make a good movie on a minimal budget.

1396400,3,B000056BPH,"The Journey of Jared Price - 3 *'s

Corey Spears did an Outstanding performance as Jared! I am also a Big fan of Director; Dustin Lance Black - ""On The Bus"" actually got me to burning man in '06 & `07. I also really enjoyed the character of Mrs. Haines - I think she did a fine job of adding some sophistication and comic relief. Granted with Guerrilla film making there are always compromises and I think had Lance had a bit more time, the overall product would have been greatly enhanced. I did feel for the lost innocence of Jared, though I felt his quickness to hop in to bed with Mr. Haines seemed a bit unbelievable based on his past experience at the hostile and his sense of sexual indifference. I really didn't feel a sense of sexual interest in Jared's character - there was a brief ""shower"" scene with Jared checking out a guy in the shower, however Jared quickly exits. There is also a scene with Jared video taping a unsuspecting guy masturbating, though I really didn't get a sense that Jared had any sexual interest in men or in general. Though everyone loves a good sex scene, I felt some of the sex scenes between Mr. Haines and his partner seemed absolutely gratuitous and I feel that more focus should have been placed on Mr. Haines seduction of Jared - that plot aspect seemed so rushed and unbelievable; a couple of meetings at the house, a poolside drink, then into bed...all and all a fine coming of age movie, with a hot star and a hot director (I wonder what the true story is behind Corey's casting - perhaps a good topic for a future film - now a sex scene between Lance & Corey would be anything but gratuitous).",1207094400,2,1640,4.377049180327869

Now having it on DVD, it's becoming one of those again. The only charecter I don't like is Matthew, kinda bad choice in name after Matthew Shepard was killed, but this is just a charecter. I adored Jared, his relationship with Robert, Mrs. Haines, Matthew's boyfriend Andrew. The ending was very inspiring-Mrs. Haines speech to Jared, then the kiss between Jared and Robert-that was cute. Some say this film is loaded with cliches, but my attitude to that is-if it has a good story and believable charecters, why should that matter?)Corey Spears does a very nice job with his role as Jared, and he's cute! Corey makes the comment in the feature, that he did a very uncomfortable scene with Matthew/Steve Tyler, followed by the love scene,he goes from hating him, to having partial sex with him.

This is an independent film and should be viewed as such.  It's not big-budget.  Lower-budget films have a real-life feel that can't be equalled by big-budget Hollywood movies.

All the characters are well-defined and very real.  The acting is good, considering the budget the movie was on.  I was impressed with Corey Spears' performance and surprised that, at 25, he could successfully pull of being an 18 year old.

1396406,2,B000056BPH,"It's a nice little film, but it could have been much better.  Innocent, soft-spoken, small town twink moves to The Big City (L.A.) with little in the way of possessions but big dreams of success and love.  He becomes torn between a jaded, wealthy chicken hawk and a city twink of modest means who truly loves hiim.  The story is as old as gay fiction itself, yet it had the potential to work.  But the story turns out to be both hard to believe and predictable.  How many teenagers in L.A. are able to find a wealthy, compassionate employer days after arriving from home?  How likely is it that the boy in question would find someone who truly loves him only a day after he arrived in town?  The title character is too good to be true, more of a gay fantasy figure than someone you'd meet in real life.  Yet, in spite of plot holes you could drive a truck through, you'll have no trouble guessing what will happen next.  And there's never any doubt about how the romantic triangle would turn out.  Also, the film features poor lighting and shaky camerawork, which strains the eyes.  And some of the sex scenes are so voyeristic, they're creepy.

In fairness, there are some pleasures for the viewer.  Corey Spears is so adorable, you can't help but cheer him on.  His looks are handsome yet a little goofy, and he conveys a combinaiton of winsomeness, sensuality, and awkwardness that's irresistable.  Though he was 25 y/o during the filming, he's completely convincing as a naive teenager.  Josh Jacobson is worthwhile as the edgy buddy who loves Jared, and he's since gone on to some success in film and television.  There are also some good scenes.  The opening scene where Jared arrives in Hollywood and stares in awe at the new surroundings is completely believeable.  There's a scene between Jared and Matthew, who just wants him as a sex toy, in which Matthew talks of his mother who gave him everything but herself during his childhood.  It gives the character some depth rather than making him a two-diminsional creep.  And the kind elderly woman who takes Jared under her wing admitting she wished she had been a better mother to her son, who has grown up to be shallow and incapable of love.

1396411,5,B000056BPH,"Having viewed this movie several times now, several aspects worth comment jump into my mind.
The look and feel of this movie, shot on video with handheld cameras, with sometimes bouncy and jerking motions, perfectly mimics the type of video the main character Jared is shooting. Therefore, I think the director has very effectively tied the cinematography to the main character and therefore the story that is being told. It is almost as if Jared filmed his own life story.
Dustin Lance Black has created a film that is very different from the typical ""young gay man goes to the big city"" story. When we first see Jared, he has just arrived in LA and with a backpack and sleeping bag, he appears to a target for any street criminals. Even more so when he is seen making a call to the youth hostel...one view of Jared is through the window of a car parked across the street. This gave me the impression that someone was watching Jared and that this might lead to the typical ""pimp forces Jared to turn tricks"" movie. But that didn't happen.
Instead this is the story of a genuniely sweet and very, very polite young man exploring a world different than his Georgia upbringing. This is not about being all excited about being in LA; its not about the glamour of LA.
Jared's polite Southern upbringing is evident when he first meets Mrs. Haines. The way in which Corey Spears delivers his lines leads me to believe he is overly polite and kind...so if he isn't this way, then he is a truly great actor.
Having known several ""Mrs. Haines"" in my life, I found Rocki Cragg's acting to be right on the money. She is one of those wise, yet quirky characters that make any moving interesting. Mrs. Haines plays a ""former diva"" perfectly, whether she ever was a true diva or not.
But all the other characters Jared meets are also interesting...his hostel roommate who makes his money as a male prostitute, the front desk clerk who can't say ""monopolize"", Robert, the boy who just wants someone to love, Matthew, who seems to find men by posting job notices in youth hostels. While Robert is overlooked through most of the film, Matthew makes his presence known.
Matthew supposedly has it all...success(with his mother's money) and a boyfriend. But Matthew is really the little boy in this film, not knowing that he really does have alot and always wanting more. Sexually speaking, he gives Jared a rather pleasant introduction to gay sex. Emotionally speaking, Matthew tramples on Jared. Not ready to give up his boyfriend, Matthew suggests a threeway with Jared and Matthew's boyfriend and this is where Jared fails to understand the big city ways and rightfully so. Matthew's boyfriend may be the most understanding character in the film...offering to give Jared a ride home when the threeway sex fails and there are alot of hurt feelings all around.
Quite possibly it is Matthew's office assistant who is the best overall character in the film.  Her straight forward and totally honest approach to life is always refreshing among a group of people where emotions rule the day.  She's the type of friend everyone wishes they had and the type of person who gives great advice that is usually ignored.
Overall, this film is a rare gem. It's simple, raw, rough, and sweet all at the same time. I think what makes this film a standout is how the cinematography blends so well with the story and the character of Jared.",1045267200,49,3406,4.693979933110368
1396412,2,B000056BPH,"I'm sure all the folks involved in making this movie are good people. The DVD contains an interview with the cast and the writer/director, and they all seem pretty likeable... But the movie just wasn't very good.
First, the good points. The story was ultimately sweet -- it had heart. I found myself liking Jared and Robert and I rooted for them to get together. (Corey Spears is so darn cute that I was often distracted from his mostly not-so-great acting; Josh Jacobson was better.)
The film quality: I could forgive the fact that it was filmed on digital video.
And now the bad points.
The characters: they're mainly unoriginal archetypes straight out of 60 years of gay pulp fiction. The cute, innocent small-town boy in the big city; the rich, 30something guy who turns out to be a lecher; the elderly woman who dispenses wisdom and turns out to be liberal...
The plot: It's all black and white and obvious. Men with money won't bring you happiness; follow your heart instead! Okay -- there are definitely lots of people out there who still don't know that, so maybe they'd benefit from watching this. But you can advocate a point of view while still writing an entertaining movie with three-dimensional characters.
The plot has little narrative flow. Things are left unestablished. For instance, what does Jared see in Robert in the first place? And there's little dramatic buildup and payoff. Things happen abruptly. There's a scene where Robert calls Jared but Matthew doesn't give him the message, and then it's dropped. In a better movie, this scene would lead to misunderstandings and a little bit of tension. But nothing happens here.
The movie's dialogue is pretty bad. It consists mostly of cliches, as well as things like ""cool"" and ""oh, okay"" and ""my bad."" Sure, those expressions are true to life. And many of the scenes between Jared and Robert seemed very real, as if I were watching them on a surveillance camera. But there's ""interesting"" real and there's ""boring"" real. Watching paint dry is also real, but it's not entertaining.
Although much of the acting is decent, two of the actors were pretty mediocre.",1043971200,4,2130,4.838356164383562
1396413,5,B000056BPH,My Partner of going on 17 years and I really enjoyed this movie.

1396414,4,B000056BPH,"I must say, that I really enjoyed this movie.  Jared, (Corey) is a sweet, innocent, vunerable character that pulled at my heartstrings in just about every scene.  He has the bluest eyes that are just beautiful.  His journey of self realization hit very close to home for me and was delivered honestly.  The other characters were campy and fun, especially the widow Haines, she was just a hoot. And I must say that, Andrew (Bryan) is totally HOT! He has a beautiful body and I enjoyed every scene that he was in, however, I think it would have been WAY hot if he and Jared (Corey) could have been in a steamy love scene too! The movie as a whole is well worth seeing and I can't wait for my own copy to arrive.

1396415,5,B000056BPH,"I have purchased many gay movies and The Journey of Jared Price is the best. I have watched this movie three times already. Corey Spears, who plays Jared- and was also in Traffic as the kid who OD'd, is a cutie and a swell actor. When you watch Corey Spears the actor in the interview at the end of the DVD you can get a sense of the difference that separates the actor and the character. Corey has a hot body, beautiful electric-blue eyes, is polite to a fault, has that cute little southern accent and has the most expressive face of anyone I have seen. Rocki Craig who plays Ms. Haines is to die for. The story was inspiring and  shows Jared to be a man of  character as he leaves at the end even though he could have stayed and milked the situation. Instead, he moved on with his life. His struggle with his sexuality comes through, especially in the scene in the park where he meets the guy from the hostel. The DVD is clear and has a lot of nice extra features such as deleted scenes and interviews with the cast. Dustin Lance Black is young but obviously a talented director- although his name sounds toooooo gay...",1037404800,7,1122,4.312796208530806
1396416,3,B000056BPH,"Okay, first off, I DID enjoy this movie.  No, REALLY.  It was fun, for what it was worth.
But yeah, it was pretty clear this movie was done in a really short time.  It's not as polished as it could be.  The plot line wasn't terribly compelling.  The acting was decidedly amateurish.
The only saving grace for this movie was the old blind woman (whose name I forget) who actually had the strength to do something beyond just bending to the whims of other people.  As a blind person, she was the one person who could see past all the...in everyone's lives.
Rent this movie.  Really.",1036972800,2,580,4.415094339622642
1396417,3,B000056BPH,"Parts of this movie are great.  Parts are a bit rough.  When you come to realize that it was made in 5 days with little budget, the end result is pretty amazing.  It is a good quality movie that tells a sweet story.
The Matthew character is well done.  You don't know whether to hate him or pity him.  There are many people like this out in the community so I think the character hits a note of familiarity.  The Robert character is a bit simple but likable. The actor that plays Jared does a fine job but there are times when it just doesn't seem to come together.  Specifically, when Jared is yelling at Matthew.  That feels forced.
Mrs Haines is, in my opinion, the most lovable character and if I were to ever watch this movie again, it would be because of her.  She adds a great deal to the movie.  Her interactions with Jared are kind of like icing on a cake but it is very sweet.
Overall, not a great film but certainly worth watching.  A good ""snuggle up with your sweetie and watch a good movie"" kind of film.",1036022400,,1018,4.195876288659794
1396418,4,B000056BPH,"I really like this movie. The characters are close to ""life-like"". Well, Jared Price is a nice and very cute guy who takes a job at an almost blind old woman as a caretaker. He meets her son who at the beginning is quite cold to Jared. But after a while they come closer and Jared shares his first gay lovenight with him. But what he doesn't know is that the guy he fell in love with already is in a relationship. So, when Jared is invited to his male lover at home, he didn't know that he should be part of a three-way... So, a big disappointment is about to come up. But what Jared doesn't realize is that there ia already someone else waiting for him who fell deeply in love with him. This movie really made me feel like watching my own beginnings in gay life. It's honest and it can really happen. Watch for yourself. It's a low-budget movie but really more than well-done. And it's amazing that they shot ""The Journey of Jared Price"" just in a few days",1031702400,4,957,4.206521739130435
1396419,4,B000056BPH,"This movie had a lot of strong points but many weak points. I'll start off with the weaknesses. One being Corey Spears (Jared). He's a horrible actor. Right away I felt like I was watching a cheap porn flick. Spears looks like an actor playing a character. You can often see a blank look on his face when he's trying to think up his next line. The emotion that comes out of him is as cheap as this films budget. I think the director of this movie did a great job for what he had to work with. If he had the right equipment with him the sound and picture quality of this movie wouldn't seem so junky. It's clear though, this young director has a lot of learning to do about making a movie. The shinning light of this movie is Rocki Cragg (Mrs. Haines) who plays the old woman Jared is hired to take care of. While she does a terrible job of portraying a blind woman, she gives out the best acting job in the entire movie. Josh Jacobson (Robert) who plays Jared's true love also does a great job. The story is a bit weak but enjoyable. I'll give this movie 4 stars. 2 stars for Rocki Cragg, 1 star for Josh Jacobson and 1 star for storyline.",1009929600,4,1139,4.135135135135135
1396420,3,B000056BPH,"While watching JOURNEY OF JARED PRICE, I discovered it was made on a low budget.  Now that is not necessarily bad, and more often than not during the film I overlooked some of the simpler elements.  However, the cinematography was a huge distraction; too often, the camera would track the movement of every actors hand and pause on whatever the had just moved/set down/lifted up as if it were an important event.  The dialogue was inconsistent; either warm and touching or clich.  Still, this remains a pleasant movie, the sort that needs to be made, but I hope that more care (and perhaps more money) is involved in the director/screenwriters next project.",1001980800,5,657,4.839285714285714

1396423,4,B000056BPH,This is one of the better films I have seen in quite some time. The director chose to film with handheld cams which gave the film a more down to earth style. The actors were very believeable in their character portrayals. Perhaps the best two scenes in the movie that touched me the most was the scene when Jared talked with his blind charge informing her he was leaving and the final scene where Jared asked Robert for a date. This film was reminicent of Beautiful Thing. It explored the coming out of a young man and the conflicts he encounters with the gay lifestyle's good and bad subject matters.

I completely enjoyed this film.  From the moment Jared arrives above ground in West Hollywood to the final romantic kiss.
Some people may review this film negatively, take those reviews with a grain of salt.  The things to look for in a good film are all here.  Humor, Love, Fear, Loneliness and adventure into the unknown.  I would like to see anyone of the previous negative reviewers do as good a job on the budget that was provided ($30,000).
Don't be swayed this is a great film and very enjoyable.  If you're just comming out or you can remember that first experience and all the confusion and goose-bumps that go with it, then this is a movie for you!  If you're looking for big money, overpaid actors who don't care about their roles, and you need everything in a film explained to you, then this is not your movie!  Go watch ""Too Wong Foo"".  This film may be too much for you.
There aren't many films that can relate to the comming out story the way this one does!  If you like this one the way I enjoyed it and you understand the emotion of comming out and first loves, then I will also recommend ""Beautiful Thing"".",987897600,16,1250,4.32618025751073

As a major bonus, the ""interviews"" and ""outtakes"" on this DVD are very entertaining (unlike most DVDs, IMHO).
One thing that I felt important was that this is a film from (mostly) gay people for gay people - not like so many that mainly feature straight actors playing gay roles.
The lead actor is Corey Spears.  He did a brilliant job.  He was also in ""Traffic"" (which I have yet to see).  Let's hope his acting career really takes off.  I look forward to more films from the director, Lance Black.

1396428,3,B000056BPH,"I can agree with some of what the previous reviewer stated because I had a difficult time getting into this story. It's a coming out story of a guy who comes to California from Georgia, and while at a youth hostel, he kisses a guy for the first time. He's a little freaked, but Jared does know it's what he wants, but it's not until he's working for a blind lady, and her son seduces him, that Jared discovers himself. Although this relationship dissolves into the fantasy it is, Jared does track down the guy from the youth hostel in hopes of finding happiness.

Everything is very simple in the tale, naivet is the name of the game. I guess that if more gay films had these sensitivity audiences would flow. Nothing is forced in this simple story of a boy arriving in the big city and finding his way through it, having to decide between the eternal dilemma of love and money.
Maybe what gave me such a good feeling in the tale is the protagonist, played by Casey Spears. He mixes such a great gentleness in a cute body you feel immediately sympathetic towards him. The fact that Casey made so little films after this is a proof that he was simply being himself, what adds to the film.
The rest of the cast is not bad, having some highlights like Steve Tyler the spoiled son of Jarred patroness,.
