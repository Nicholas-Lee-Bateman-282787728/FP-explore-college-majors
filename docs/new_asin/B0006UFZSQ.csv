2196379,4,B0006UFZSQ,"Okay, I have to say that I am a true believer in the fact that there is a time and a place for films in bad taste that taste good.  I saw this movie in 1985 and even then it was hard to come by.  But I have never laughed as hard as when the lady threw the...oops, almost gave up a punchline.

I read the other reviews regarding the sound and transfer of this sick gem and for the last 8 months I hesitated... but last week I took the chance and ordered it.  I AM VERY HAPPY I DID!  This film wasn't in Cinemascope to begin with.  It had a relatively low budget as well.  What did these folks want?

I will say this.  The transfer on MY copy was identical to the release I originally saw.

The sound was equally identical. Have any of these people seen any of John Water's films pre-POLYESTER?  I think not.  They're probably REALLY proud to have seen HAIRSPRAY upon it's original release.  They must think that THAT makes them really ""cutting edge"".

Now granted, Cheezy Films may have gone in and done some fix-it work if they received enough returns and/or complaints. If so then at least they got the hint and corrected their mistakes.

Let me sum it up like this....

If you know this movie, and need to own it... you'll get exactly the film you have in your mind's eye.

If you are a fan of films like FEMALE TROUBLE or THE FORBIDDEN ZONE... you're gonna LOVE THIS.

Carroll Baker is Awesome!  SuSu (Susan tyrrell) is unforgetable.  Brigid Polk (Berlin) is in a class all by herself.  If you adore ""CIAO MANHATTAN"" then you REALLY should order up a serving of ""BAD"" chow... it taste's so good! Then take a Howard Hughes sponge bath!",1140739200,7,1637,4.284313725490196
2196380,1,B0006UFZSQ,"I will go a step further from the other reviewers and state that not only is this a bad DVD transfer but also a bad film.  I have no problem with dark humor but a little irony would be helpful.  The acting, direction, and writing here are strictly amateur hour.  When the high point of a film is Susan Tyrrell's account of a depressive welfare mom then you are in trouble.  As for the aforementioned problems with the images breaking down at the film's midway point and then stopping altogether it's all true.  Don't waste your time or money on this DVD because it's not worth the aggravation.  Cheezy Video, indeed!",1130457600,6,616,4.504504504504505
2196381,1,B0006UFZSQ,"I originally saw this movie at my colleges student union hall in 1977 and loved it. As cult movie fan I always wanted to own it and was very happy to find and purchase a dvd version on Amazon in early Dec. 04. However,3 defective dvds later(shipping the first 2 back at my own expense),and numerous unanswered emails. It's now Mar. 05. Thank you Amazon for refunding my purchase. One reviewer suggested that Cheezy Flicks is missing a quality control dept,I feel they may be lacking a cutomer service dept as well. Buyers please check the feedback on this seller before you make a purchase. Once again this is a great movie and I would love to see a vialbe dvd version available.",1111795200,20,679,4.528455284552845
2196382,1,B0006UFZSQ,"These DVDs are corrupted and do not play properly. I received the first defective DVD on Fri, 14 Jan 2005 and contacted the Seller. The Seller told me I needed to return the defective DVD before they would ship a replacement. I noticed on the Amazon merchant reviews that several people have had this same problem and I asked the Seller if they did indeed have copies which worked. They promised that they did have working DVDs and that they would ship one as soon as they received the defective DVD. Reluctantly I spent an additional $3 to ship the DVD back to the Seller. Today (Fri, 28 Jan 2005) I received the replacement DVD. This DVD is also defective with the identical manufacturing flaws. Evidentially Cheezy Flicks has no QC department to check their products. The DVD is quite obviously a bootleg/DVD-R copy of a worn out VHS tape. We play DVD-R's quite frequently on both our DVD systems, so it isn't a compatibility issue. The DVD will not load automatically when placed in the machine.  When inserted into the machine, the DVD freezes and the number ""9"" appears on the DVD player. After pressing Play many times, the menu eventually appears.  We were able to play the movie about 2/3 of the way through but there were constant pixilation and corruption problems all the way through.  Then around Chapter 10 the DVD stops completely. Also, none of the other options on the menu work. For example, pressing ""Other titles offered by Cheezy Flicks"" causes the DVD to stop. The DVD and the replacement were both defective. Wait for the legitimate release. Don't waste your money on these.",1106870400,35,1597,4.7168458781362

8043428,4,B0006UFZSQ,"I ordered this from Cheezy Distribution in the Amazon Marketplace, and my copy was a factory-pressed original.  I don't understand all the complaints here about the quality of the transfer.  Yes it's pan & scan, yes the print is on the faded side, and apparently it is missing a small scene, but there are no compression related issues and the dimmer colors tend to go along with the grindhouse feel of the picture.  I am grateful for a chance to see this on DVD so I say thank you to Cheezy Flicks for providing the only available version as of this writing.",1374537600,,559,4.46078431372549
8043429,1,B0006UFZSQ,"A terrible transfer to DVD. The VHS wasn't the best in the world either. But, it is an Andy Warhol film and Joe Dallesandro is in it, as he has been in other Warhol films. Supposedly, another transfer to DVD is going to happen soon? Will wait and see. It is a comedy and the story is funny. But, the DVD is too sad to watch, (quality wise). A young Perry King also stars as well as Carroll Baker (""Baby Doll""). Hopefully, a restored DVD will soon be in the making.",1254182400,,464,4.1098901098901095
8043430,1,B0006UFZSQ,"Last I heard, the rights to this film were owned by Avco Embassy Entertainment, and not the screwy company that is marketing this obvious bootleg product. Fans of the original film should stay as far away from this ""company"" as possible.",1238544000,3,237,4.804878048780488
8043431,4,B0006UFZSQ,"This DVD is of VHS quality but still the same good movie starring Carroll Baker.  If you want a great off beat funny movie, this is the classic of all funny movies.",1223078400,,164,4.125

8043433,5,B0006UFZSQ,"I must say that this is one of my all time favorite movies and having seen the VHS edition dozens of times, this edition is flawed.  It is missing at least two short scenes, one of which is hysterically shocking where Glenda and Marsha mug a guy in a wheelchair.  The other shot that I noticed absent is where the wife of the man with one arm (whose nose hair is growing back) insults the guy waiting for the pay phone in the bar.  The copy I viewed had no problems playing.",1204156800,4,474,4.130434782608695
8043434,5,B0006UFZSQ,"Just thought I'd come on here and offer my 2 cents for others, like me, who saw all these scary reviews and decided NOT to get this company's (CheesyFlicks) copy of this much-sought-after, criminally under-seen masterpiece. I want to kick myself for waiting! The experiences those reviewers had might be true, but I bought this in November of 2007 and it plays just fine. Plus the DVD arrived immediately with no shipping problems. I actually rented it on Netflix first, then when I saw how good it was, I bought one. We have three DVD players (even a lousy, temperamental one) and it played perfectly on all three. The quality looks like a first generation video transfer, full screen, from a clean, new video copy - which is what this DVD is - so you know what to expect. It's fine! The sound is also crisp and clean. For people that love this film, like me, it's more than fine, it's a miracle. At least until it's officially released. OF NOTE: fans of this film should be aware that the particular print this company used is missing one scene. It's the scene after Glenda and Marsha have left Estelle's apartment after meeting with her, walking down the street talking about how they'll come back and kill the dog tomorrow, and then they suddenly mug those guys in wheelchairs for no reason. That whole scene is just not there. A little research reveals that many versions of this film have been circulating around over the decades, with some scenes missing in some prints, maybe because they were considered too awful (yet the baby scene is still in? Haha!). Otherwise there's nothing else missing, it's all there. WHAT A GREAT FILM!!!",1195948800,5,1640,4.678200692041522
8043435,4,B0006UFZSQ,"Since most reviews here are negative towards the CheesyFlicks edition of Andy Warhol's Bad and not the content of the film, I thought I should chime-in to say that the quality is just fine. This is an underground movie and has an underground movie ""look."" The quality is acceptable and looks better than the VHS editions out there.

I also did not experience any technical difficulties with this DVD, nor did I have any delays in service from the seller ""CheeezyFlicks."" I'm grateful to finally have this film on DVD.",1153180800,,517,4.7444444444444445
