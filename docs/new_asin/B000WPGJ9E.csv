8224821,4,B000WPGJ9E,Interesting piece on how one little indiscretion can spiral out of control.  A little on the same theme as Breaking Bad.  And Brendan Coyle is always great.,1430956800,,156,4.7407407407407405
8224822,5,B000WPGJ9E,"I liked the plot. A couple horrified with the actual state of public school...violence, drugs, teachers fighting to control a primary school class, look for a decent school  to their kid.  But had to be free, the private schools were way of their budget. They find a school that seems perfect. Only its a catholic school. It gives preferences for catholic children and their families. they are very strict about admission. They require referenced form priests, and check on the family background.

The parents start with little lies to assure a better education to their daughter and things get out of control
I Liked this movie.  it made me think about conditions of public schools nowadays and how far a parent would go to assure their child (children ) a proper education. And the religious problems involved. The school didn't forbid non catholics. But in the end, for practical purposes, there were no vacancy left for non practicising  catholics. This movie isn't a critic about catholicism tough. Im sure this problem happens in any religious oriented school. They are build for their communities, to pass on their secular and religious education. But with the failures of a State decent educational policy, in several cases those schools end being the centers of decent education.  Drugs are less present not only due external forbidness but also strong internal personal formation and inner beliefs from the students..How to open to everyone and do not loos their religious orientation that allowed them to reach the excellency? the religion is tha base of formation of the character. how deal with people with other faiths, or no faith t all without compromising the core of their educational beliefs?
 The movie made me think of all this.

Christopher is awesome as always, The other actors have good actings too. Several thumbs up for the movie.",1418860800,,1857,5.0064935064935066

The no-subtitles does make it a little difficult to sometimes understand the accents, but over all the movie is easy to follow, if not an easy subject.",1276473600,,314,4.508771929824562
