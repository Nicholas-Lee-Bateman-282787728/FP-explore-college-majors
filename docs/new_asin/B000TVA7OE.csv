Fun film !",1399766400,,113,4.428571428571429
2910494,5,B000TVA7OE,"I won't say much about the movie. Most people have seen it. I love it.
The blu ray disc is spectacular. The picture and the DTS HD sound is amazing. They also have DOLBY TRUHD on here.
I own a lot of Hindi movies that I've copied onto my DVD-R discs and I've been happy with the picture and sound quality. For the first time, I witnessed what a blu-ray disc can do to a movie. I was speechless. The picture quality is 10 times sharper than my compressed video and the sound quality is 10 times sharper than my compressed audio on my DVD-R

So I've donated my copy of this movie in DVD-R and I'm keeping this blu ray disc. It is of course region free and will play easily on any blu ray player in the world. Please be warned that this will not play in a DVD player. This blu-ray disc requires a blu-ray player.

Highly recommended!!",1380672000,,831,4.15527950310559
2910495,5,B000TVA7OE,"Loved Tabu and Amitabh Bachchan. Their interaction was awesome. Movie had everything, funny, sad, love, tears, Really cute love story. Worth watching.",1368662400,,150,5.863636363636363
2910496,4,B000TVA7OE,Just a nice movie breaking the ice of limitation boundaries of societies.........by sharing and focusing on sweet love!!! Very well written & acted out.,1363392000,,152,5.375
2910497,4,B000TVA7OE,"I'll admit, I'm a sucker for *masala* conventions - overstuffed emotions, whiplash plot swings from comedy to romance to tragedy, and elaborate song and dance numbers at the drop of a hat...especially that last. CHEENI KUM doesn't have any elaborate song and dance numbers, the emotions are recognizably human-sized, and even the plot swings feel logically presented in the story rather than tossed in as desperate ""POP!""s to get the audience excited. Having said that, this is one of my favorite recent Indian movies - right up there with EKLAYVA: THE ROYAL GUARD, AAJA NACHLE, RANG DE BASANTI, OM SHANTI OM, BHOOTHNATH and KRRISH.

If you watch any Indian movies, you already know Amitabh Bachchan is a wonderfully engaging ham bursting with star quality - CHEENI KUM shows just how great he can be playing a (mostly) human-sized character, a middle-aged but still single Indian man in London with a cranky mother still living with him. (Let's make allowances - he is the Executive Chef/Owner of a top Indian restaurant, after all, so he gets to roar a lot in the early going.) He meets disagreeably but is intrigued by a single Indian woman in her Thirties (Tabu) who won't be pushed around by his arrogance or bellicosity, and who shows him up on the proper cooking of a dish (one of his line cooks mistakenly added sugar instead of salt, which he would have known if he'd bothered to taste it when she first complained to him!). While never exactly admitting he was wrong, he tries to make it up to her - and thus begins a slow slide into the two of them falling for each other, punctuated with lots of increasingly affectionate insults and scoldings. When he finally asks her to marry him, the two of them, with his mother in tow, head off to Delhi to get her Father's permission - her pompous, cricket-mad, non-vegetarian Father who's six years younger than his perspective son-in-law!

Bachchan and Tabu give beautifully modulated performances, and are completely believable as two older people who become a couple. Even the broadly comic (her father, supposedly a follower of Gandhi, stages a petulant hunger strike so his daughter won't marry a man older than he is) or ""filmi"" elements (the lovable cancer-stricken pre-teen daughter of his neighbor dies near the climax, resulting in Bachchan having a Bollywood-style mad with grief scene!) are offset by the human-sized situations and performances.

CHEENI KUM is a Bollywood movie I think just about anybody, Western film fan as well as Indian one, would enjoy. If only it had a couple song and dance numbers, it would have been a five-star movie for me....",1362355200,3,2620,4.856823266219239
2910498,4,B000TVA7OE,Chini Kum was a nice entertainer. Amitabh never fails to entertain (as an eligible bachelor once again). Tabu plays a good role too.,1352073600,,132,4.782608695652174
2910499,4,B000TVA7OE,I love bollywood and cooking and this movie had both. I thought it was funny.  I like the music in this movie also.,1332028800,,115,4.0
2910500,5,B000TVA7OE,I got this because my Mother loves Bollywood movies and it was a good gift for her. This one is certainly different from other Bollywood films in that it's about older people. Passion and romance aren't just for the young after all. Overlooking a few elements of ridiculousness it's a pretty good film. Well worth the money.,1280188800,5,324,4.701754385964913
2910501,4,B000TVA7OE,"Cheeni Kum is not your typical love story. This film is about Buddha, a 64-year-old grumpy chef, of an authentic Indian restaurant, in London, and Neena, 34-year-old woman visiting London, who falls in love. The first encounter is anything but good; Neena is the first person to ever send back a dish, Zafarani Pulao, a traditional Indian dish, at his restaurant saying it is too sweet. Buddha is very upset and approaches Neena. He is very rude in demanding her to tell him how to make the dish correctly, the close up of Neena's face shows that she isn't upset with him, but wants to laugh at him.  The next day Neena brings her homemade Zafarani Pulao to Buddha at the restaurant, that is when he started to feel differently about her, because in the scene she leaves in slow motion and she looks back at him one more time before she goes around the corner. After that moment he feels as though he must apologize to her, but he cannot say sorry, so instead he gives her his umbrella. Neena goes to the restaurant daily saying she is there to return the umbrella but never does. Their relationship grows more and they fall in love. Buddah asks Neena to marry him and she accepts but there is a problem, Buddha is 6 years older than her father and he needs his blessing for the two of them to wed. After two days of starvation he finally accepted his offer to marry his daughter.
 This movie was not one of my favorites because there was no singing or dancing. It was hard to keep me focused, because the music only came on whenever she was leaving him and was walking away. This movie was too drawn out for me but others might like it because it sticks closely with reality. As the relationship grows you seem them fall more in love with each other, from taking walks in the park, having cute nicknames for each other and getting upset when they don't see each other for a day. It shows in the relationship evolving and becoming something beautiful and different than other love stories.",1256428800,,1989,4.461538461538462

8211104,4,B000TVA7OE,"Great movie and different from the usual Bollywood stuff. Drags a little when the story moves to India but still remains engaging.
