2791833,5,B000O76WRO,"This is what one might call a ""sleeper"" documentary movie. It is little-known yet so marvelously well done.  It is an important story because an entire people were forced to become refugees and cross a continent simply to escape relentless persecution.  A very important saga, well told.
The story's focus is a stunning rescue of stranded and dying handcart pioneers in the bitterly freezing winter.  The rescue was initiated and organized by Brigham Young.  It is absolutely worth spending for and seeing.",1337644800,3,506,5.134146341463414

2791835,4,B000O76WRO,An amazing and touching story told in a documentary style. I learned many things about these handcart companies that I had not previously known.,1184198400,,144,5.041666666666667
8183541,1,B000O76WRO,"For a documentary called ""sweet water rescue"" it down plays this so much and to the point we can't even mention the names of the boys carrying saints long into the night. My great-great grandfather David P Kimball died a young father after never recovering his health from this experience letters to his sister Vilate etc lay this out. Just not popular to be a Kimball right now.",1490400000,,379,4.588235294117647
8183542,5,B000O76WRO,"Well done, informative, and thought provoking.  I had not realized these people were mainly from Europe.  I guess I got this story confused with the Donner Party story.  I didn't realize there was such a large immigration coming to SLC (40,000 from Europe total).  It happened about 9 years after the first pioneers got to SLC.  It involved 2 of 10 handcart companies that traveled that summer in 1856.  These last two started way too late in the season, and what followed was very cold hard times.  1000 of the 1200 pioneers in these two handcart companies made it.  Kind of surprising so many lived after you see what they went through.  These people are tough stock!",1486598400,,669,4.64957264957265

8183545,3,B000O76WRO,"This documentary that tells the story of the Willie and Martin hand cart companies of Mormon converts that came from England seeking to reach Zion. Many such hand cart companies did so successfully. These two, however, left late in the season.  Consequently, they  were subject to many travails and hardships along the way,  while crossing hundreds of miles across the prairies and mountains on the way to Utah. They did this incredible trek pulling their carts of belonging and supplies by hand.

Due to the severity of the weather conditions and lack of adequate food supplies and clothing, a large number of these travelers perished. Were it not for the fact that Brigham Young ordered a rescue mission to search for them and bring them much needed life  saving food supplies and warm clothing, many more would have perished. As it was, about two hundred  died from the hardships encountered along the way, although a thousand of them managed to survive and reach the promised land.

While theirs is an exciting tale of survival, the recounting of that story  is anything but in this tastefully produced documentary. Although the production values are excellent, the documentary tends to drag somewhat. Those with an interest in Mormon history, however, will no doubt get a modicum of enjoyment of seeing a part of that history brought to life.",1463184000,2,1347,4.955555555555556

8183548,5,B000O76WRO,"A barely known, not often told story of incredible hardship and courage.  The tenacity of the migrants pulling/pushing those handcarts is amazing, but thw stamina and will of the rescuers is even more impressive.  A good story that some of the narrow monded will discount because they were mormons.",1446336000,,298,5.061224489795919
