3081439,5,B00127R2WY,"Fullmetal Alchemist is simply one of the most amazing anime titles in existence. It's well animated, brilliantly thought out, and highly entertaining. The phychological and ethical issues within the story are well related to the struggles of real life. The messages and morals hidden in the show are wonderful. The characters are bright and vibrant, and the bittersweet ending makes it more believable than a sappy ""happily ever after"". It's hopeful, heartfelt and, once again, briliant.",1212364800,,487,5.421052631578948
3081440,4,B00127R2WY,"I am sure that this would have been a great set, if Amazon ever actually delivered it to me. They shipped it to an old address and then said I could reorder it for twice what I originally ordered it for. Needless to say I am buying it elsewhere.",1210723200,,245,4.020408163265306
3081441,5,B00127R2WY,"Season 2 part 2 has some of the heaviest episodes from the series. FMA is not your ordinary anime, the historical references and religious undertones are subtle but astoundingly prevalent throughout the series. The climax is profound both visually and emotionally. I've never been a huge anime fan, I've only really liked ""Cowboy Bebop"" before, which is another anime I recommend highly! But FMA is much deeper, and has many layers. It is one of those shows you can watch over and over again, and learn or find something new each time.",1210550400,,535,4.826086956521739
3081442,5,B00127R2WY,"As I am lazy and my sentiments are pretty much the same as when I reviewed the first three boxsets, I pretty much c/p'd those reviews and just added necessary changes.

If you love the Fullmetal Alchemist anime, this is a great box set to get. This box set comes with DVDs 11-13 of the series as well as booklets/inserts for each DVD. Each booklet contains beautiful artwork from the show, character profiles, and comments from production staff. The main box and the boxes that hold the discs and inserts are really well done; they keep everything safe and have great artwork.

I noticed the product description didn't have a rating. I, personally, wouldn't recommend this for those under 13-14 years of age, but those commenting on my previous reviews felt that ages 10-12 would be alright with it. Things get violent and there are several adult topics prevalent (war, murder, politics, racism). If you are unsure about it, just watch it before you let the children do and make your own judgment call.

Also, if you are expecting this to be the end, think again. The TV series has a somewhat open ending which is closed with the movie -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fullmetal-Alchemist-The-Movie-The-Conqueror-of-Shamballa/dp/B000FS2VZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie - The Conqueror of Shamballa</a>. I'd recommend getting the movie as well if you plan to purchase this boxset.",1209340800,,1451,5.411504424778761

3081444,5,B00127R2WY,"SOME SPOILERS ARE CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW

Fullmetal Alchemist is an amazing series, but one of its greatest achievements, in my mind, is that it managed to not only maintain its stellar quality over time, it consistently got better and better until it actually hurt to see the series come to an end. Seeing all of the plot threads that have been building throughout the whole series coming to fruition is a great payoff, sure, but it's made all the better by the fact that nothing feels like a cop-out; there wasn't a single moment where I thought ""Oh, these guys were running out of time and so they just threw that up there."" No, everything flows to a logical, incredibly satisfying and poignantly melancholy conclusion. It certainly isn't a Hollywood-style happy ending, but that was never what the series was about in the first place. And even more gratifying than the ending was being able to look back on how all of these characters had grown and changed throughout the series: Lust springs to mind first and foremost, having gone from being your stereotypical femme-fatale to a multi-layered, incredibly sympathetic and tragic heroine. And I never, ever thought I'd be able to empathize with a psychopathic monster like Envy, but the final scenes of episode 50 made me come really close to doing so, even as he... well, I won't spoil it for you here.

In short, Fullmetal Alchemist is an incredibly well done, superbly animated and acted show. The Japanese and English voice tracks are both equally impressive (one of the RARE few animes in which this has happened, the only other to my knowledge being Samurai Champloo). And sure, if you're reading this product description you're probably going to buy this anyway and you've seen the series before, but in case you haven't, just know that you're about to see some of the finest episodes of one of the best anime series ever. This world definitely goes out with a bang, and not a whimper.",1206489600,7,1948,4.760355029585799

3081549,5,B00127R2WY,"This is my (and a lot of other anime fans) all time favorite anime series (for good reason).  If you are an anime fan and have not yet seen this anime, what are you doing with your life?  You NEED to watch this.  It is a must watch for any anime lover.  It has an amazing story, great characters, beautiful music, and a nice art style.

Don't get this confused with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  They are different series.  This one originally aired while the manga was still going so about half way through the series they took some liberties and took the story in their own direction. Brotherhood on the other hand, came out after the manga had finished and follows the manga story very closely.  If you are only willing to watch one, I recommend Brotherhood over this one but they are both masterpieces in my mind.

The second series is mostly plot.  Not a lot of character development or anything.  It will seem like a bad resolution to some but that is because this is not where the series ends.  You will want to watch the move: Conqueror of Shambala for the resolution of the series.  Not nearly as good a finale as the Brotherhood one but still recommend it.",1424736000,,1171,4.466981132075472

3081578,5,B00127R2WY,"A must watch for any true FMA fan! This is the second half to the original adaptation of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" not to be confused for ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"". In this version the ""FMA"" manga wasn't completed while the anime was being produced so they basically followed the manga and then made they're own ending as they went on. ""FMA:Brotherhood"" follows the manga completely which is why many more people prefer the newer version to this version. I don't disagree either, the remake has a better story line, better animation, crisper drawings. Hands down brotherhood beats this version, but it doesn't make this version any less great. Its still the same badass anime and any true FMA fan has seen both! Highly recommend!",1409097600,,734,5.024590163934426

The action and plot really heat up for the second half of this show, but the comedy is thankfully not left in the dust. The animation and musical scores are perfect, There is just so much to praise about this series that I just can't put it all here. Now for the flaws, The ending, the last 4-5 episodes move much to fast, and story suffers or it. Major plot twists occur, instead of being wrapped up, and so much new information is thrown at the viewer that we may have to slow down and just take it all in. The conclusion is good and satisfying though, even if it leaves some large plot holes and unanswered questions (thankfully answered in the wrap up movie Conqueror of Shamballa). Also there is FMA:B which kind of obscures this series in its' shadow. But it does conclude a great series, and like the first season, it is a much watch for all human beings , anime fan or not.",1391040000,,1046,4.341836734693878

3081642,4,B00127R2WY,"The manga so good, they had to film it twice!
Season 2 of the ""original"" (which is to say, first) anime version of Fullmetal Alchemist covers about volumes 5-7 of the manga, and then goes off in its own direction, since the manga wasn't complete.  After watching this set a second time, I still think that once you get past episode 8 or 9 of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Brotherood becomes the better anime.  Brotherhood makes more sense overall, and the Father, Wrath, and Pride of Brotherhood are better characters than the Dante, Pride, and Wrath of the original series.  Also, this series is incomplete, and you really need to watch Conqueror of Shamballa to get a resolution to the plotline.

On the other hand, Season 1 of the original anime is better than the first 8 or 9 episodes of Brotherhood, and this Season 2 is still a lot better than much of the anime out there (in my limited experience.)

3081752,5,B00127R2WY,"I have been an FMA fan since its early days on Adult Swim--and to be fair, I have owned this original series, own the entire manga series and also own Brotherhood and BOTH theatrical releases. I'd say I'm in a position to make a pretty fair judgement on the two series...and I personally believe the Original Series outshines the manga/FMA-B, even though the manga/FMA-B are the 'authorized vision"" of the original creator, Arakawa...but hear me out on this, please.

The Manga, whose story diverges from THIS original series after the encounter between Hughes and Envy, was far from completed when this series was developed. The original anime was created with the author's full approval and cooperation. Arakawa even revealed the final plot elements that would conclude the story and there are some references to them if you're familiar with both stories (ex: Mustang's 'vision', the Ed's alchemic abilities at the end of both stories,etc). However, it was clear that the series would be one side of the FMA story, while Arakawa's as-yet-not-even-half-finished masterpiece would continue.

What is the essential difference--plot and characters aside? Why is the Original Series considered to be better by so many fans?
Simple. FMA The Manga/FMA Brotherhood was published in a young teen monthly manga digest(Shounen Gangan). It was aimed at a target audience of young people and older children, even though it became hugely popular world wide with audiences of all ages. The Original Series seems to be shooting for an older viewing audience, and the developed scripts and storyline and plotting reflect that.

The manga's 'evil' was a meglomaniac supernatural being unleashed upon the world and determined to become a god, with humanity as little more than a useable resource. Like Dragonball Z, our heroes have to ""go Super Saiyan"" to save the world. For a Shounen/Young Adult manga plotline, that's workable. Some adult readers/viewers may find it formulaic and may feel dissatisifed by the neat,""happily ever after"" elements of the awkward ending. It's man vs Supernatural Menace.

The evil in the Original Series comes from within the human nature. The quest for immortality that triggers the events in the manga (the King of Xerxes and the Creature in the Flask) is scaled on a human level--Dante and Hohenheim's quest for eternal life. It is humans that create the Sins through the folly of attempting to return the dead to life--not a supernatural madman and his human minions. At every turn, evil is the consequence of human greed, hubris and ignorance and nothing will ever match the horror of Edward learning the truth about Sloth and his helplessness in the face of that truth. Time and again, it all falls back on human responsiblity and human failure...and is redeemed by humans willing to sacrifice anything and everything to restore the balance again.

It's that depth of storytelling, for me personally, places this original series above the manga/brotherhood storyline. Rather than the vision of the comic artist, it is the work of screen writers and I find it far more compelling. I'm sure a lot of people will strongly disagree and Funimation is certainly doing all it can to get the original series out of the catalog and out of memory--but it won't work for the fans that love this--which is why I bought two complete series box sets--one to watch and one to lend to friends.

This has no ""happy"" ending--it is bittersweet and stunning and ultimately satisfying.",1361664000,,3486,5.064459930313589

Brotherhood may be more well-rounded, but this original series fills in some of the holes and gaps that Brotherhood has. Plus, since the beginning is longer, it seems to have a few more funny moments than Brotherhood. And a lot of the content is really interesting, and I wished it had been a part of the Brotherhood as well - i.e. how Homunculi are created, Envy's past, etc. As much as I love Brotherhood, this will always have a special place in my heart.",1358121600,,732,4.553030303030303

3081829,5,B00127R2WY,"I ordered this a while back( for my birthday i believe) but wanted to wait until i finished to write a review. This was an anime that has received so much attention and i'd heard about it so much i started watching it. Now some shows like Naruto are just overrated ( not trying to hate on i do actually like it)But with FMA it's not just about the action, it's about the story.  The characters are very real, there emotions are extremely understandable and i have developed a bond with them. The second season shows more about Ed and Al, but it also goes more into Roy, Riza, Winry and and the homoculous,if it's misspelled i'm sorry. I think the homoculous are the most ingenious villains ever created, their evil and don't care for anyone but themselves, however the lives most of them lived before they died were awful. My personal favorites Envy! The ending of the series doesn't follow the manga as i'm sure most of you know but it does a fantastic job of creating an original ending and if you want the manga faithful series try FMA: Brotherhood(I haven't seen Brotherhood yet, i'm going to start it soon. If your wondering what's a good age to start this i'd say 13, 14 and up. This show's intense has a lot of scary, violent moments, and cursing. Also there are some parts that might make very religious people upset ( in one episode Roy says ""there is no god""). I highly recommend this show you will not be dissapointed by it, and if you love it like i did Watch Brotherhood i heard it's good as well. I also have to add the acting in the English version is just amazing really they should win something for it! I hope I've been helpful.",1330560000,,1646,4.379084967320262

But I do have to warn those who are a little emotional like myself: there will be parts that make you cry, laugh, and cheer for happiness! I give this a 4.9 out of 5!

The short list includes Otomo's Astro-Boy, Okamura's Fist Of The North Star and Ken Miura's Berserk. Each are undeniably in this world class of artist category. Today, Hiromu Arakawa, is the only female manga-ka artist to reach this level to date. She introduced the world to Full Metal Alchemist in 1999 in self-published books (Dojinshi) and locally produced manga magazines (Tankobon) published in Hokkaido.

Her graphic novel series ran from 1999 to 2011, faithfully reproduced by Funamation Studios as two animated series, featured the Elric Brothers in a European steam-punk country ruled by magicians. There are dozens of fully realized characters playing major roles in the series - from the evil Homonculi, the indomitable King Bradley, the fanatical rebel Scar and many, many more strange individuals and secret organizations that the Elric Brothers encounter on their unflinching search for a means to undo the magic that made them The Full Metal Alchemist.",1319932800,,1142,5.303867403314917

3081862,3,B00127R2WY,"Ok, I'll confess, I'm a latecomer to the FMA franchise and actually started off watching Brotherhood first, knowing full well how the two series differed. Still I didn't want to make any judgements about the original anime series without watching it to completion. So after finishing FMA:Brotherhood, I set down and watch the entire original 51 ep TV series and while I can recognize how this was quite a good series when it originally came out in 2003 and there was no complete manga story yet, having watched it now in 2011 with a complete manga storyline, I cannot help but be unimpressed and frankly dissapointed with the conclusion of the original series.

As many know, the first half of the series followed whatever manga storyline was written at the time and they stretched out that material as far as they could go, about 25 eps. By the time they had to produce the final half, they had no manga storyline to base on so credit to the director and writer, they crafted an original storyline taking characters in a far different direction than would be written in the manga. It's easy to tell how this storyline was being made up as it went along because it frankly meandered, was quite directionless at time and stuffed with pointless filler as the screenwriters were trying decide where the story was going. Compared to Brotherhood, there were many gripes I had about the 2nd half of this show:

1. The Philosopher's Stone - unlike Brotherhood where that no longer became the main point of the story as it moved onto something far more important and grand, this was still the central focus and somewhat plot-driving MacGuffin of the original series. Seriously? You couldn't develop the story any further than that? At the end our main villain Dante was still trying to produce a Philosopher's Stone because she couldn't make her own.

2. Dante - Ok, this main villain was frankly quite weak, especially compared to the devious genius of Father from the second series. Her motivations were small in scope and rather pathetic, leading to an even more pathetic end.

3. The Homunculi - the original incarnations had some interesting points to them, including the personal journey of Lust, who was actually much more one dimensional in the new series, but that was probably done because she was such a prominent character in this series. But I found all the original incarnations of Pride, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Greed to be less well written and interesting.

4. Ed & Al - was it my imagination or we're our main heroes far more annoying and immature compared to their characterization in Brotherhood? Ed was about the same but more headstrong and bullheaded in the original series, and Al, my he was incredibly annoying, childish and short sighted. The Brotherhood incarnation of Al had a maturity, quick-thinking and intelligence beyond the years of his 10 year old sounding voice and frankly a very likeable and cool character. The original series Al was simply a child and thought like one.

5. The setting - You really don't see much of this world except of parts of Amnestris and some slivers of Ishbal, but both nations, as well as other nations of Drachma, Xing and the dead kingdom of Xerxes were far more fleshed out in the new series, leading to a much more vivid, rich and detailed, believable world. In the original series, you barely know anything about the history and culture of the nation where this series takes place and frankly by the end of the series, you learn little more about it than when you started.

I could go on but I've made my point pretty clear that Brotherhood really uncovers a lot of the weaknesses of the 2nd half of this original series.",1303516800,4,3682,4.734789391575663

3081887,4,B00127R2WY,"Re-post from season one review.
Really, the quality of this anime is top notch, and used to be the bar that other anime were measured against. The animation, characters, and story are second to none. A five star anime.
That is, until Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood came out. To make room, this one had to be dropped down to four stars. Now Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood holds the rank of being *the* 5 star anime. But that is because Brotherhood exceeded it, not because it is any less worthy than before.

Fullmetal Alchemist parallels Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for the first half, about. Basically, all the development chapters. At that point, they diverge greatly. Story has it that by the time they got to the midway point, they had caught up with the manga as far as it had been published, and from there on had to create a new story. The story they created was magnificent, with meaning and depth, with conflicts and struggles both internal and external. This is an anime that I feel comfortable suggesting to just about anyone, with one cautioned exception.

If you are a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I can't recommended this storyline. While this may be one of the best anime I have seen, Brotherhood exceeded this in so many ways that this one will probably be disappointing.
But to everyone else, I advise you watch this series (including the Conquerer of Shambala), wait about a month or two for it to settle, and then go get Brotherhood.",1297555200,,1473,4.818181818181818
3081888,5,B00127R2WY,"Fullmetal Alchemist The Complete Second Season is a four-disc set that contains episodes twenty-six through fifty-one of the series.  The first disc contains seven episodes, the second disc contains six episodes, the third disc contains six episodes, and the fourth disc contains six episodes, a commentary on episode fifty-one, and the extras.  On the discs, you can watch with either English or Japanese audio, and you can choose whether or not to have the English subtitles.

The first extra included on the fourth disc is a thirty-one minute documentary titled, ""The Transmutation of a Phenomenon.""  This documentary includes interviews with some of the actors for the English dub, and they talk about various aspects of the series and their characters.

The next feature is labeled as ""Square Enix Commercial.""  It runs for two minutes, and is an ad for the Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir videogame.  The third special feature on the disc is the textless openings and closings.  This feature includes two of the openings and two of the closings for the series.  Unlike the first box set, you don't get the English subtitles on the openings and closings if you're watching with Japanese audio.  The final extra are trailers for Project Blue Earth SOS, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Glass Fleet, Ragnarok, Tsubasa, and Case Closed.

When this DVD set was put together, FUNimation included the booklets from the seven individual discs that were released that included these episodes.  The first booklet starts with episode twenty-five, which was released on the first Fullmetal Alchemist box set.  Outside of that, everything else lines up.  Each booklet contains at least one write-up from someone involved with the series (the first six booklets contain a write-up from one of the Japanese voice actors, while the final booklet contains write-ups from two of the actors from the English dub who also directed the dubbing sessions).  There is also character information and images, information from the series, artwork, and episode write-ups.  The booklets are very well-done and contain a lot of information.

The quality of the series continues to be very high on this box set.  That, along with the quality of the booklets, make this a release worth owning.  If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist who wants to own the whole series on DVD, then this box set should be part of your anime collection.

In order to write this review, I watched a copy of this DVD box set that was given to me as a gift by my husband.",1297123200,36,2551,4.943661971830986
3081889,3,B00127R2WY,"Oh, what happened to you, FMA?  The first season is so good, so epic!  And then the second season becomes so bogged down, so slow, and ends with the stupidest plot twist which nearly ruins the whole show!  Sure, it seems to start out strong, and introduces one of the most kickenest of all teachers ever, Izumi, and really starts picking up the pace with Greed and his chimera crew.  And then slows it down again with Wrath and filler.  The pacing slingshots like that, alternating between exciting and boring but not doing much to advance the plot for about ten episodes before finally starting the build to the finale.  And what a disappointing finale it was.  The twist in regards to the truth behind the Gate just calls into question all you thought you knew about the world of FMA, and not in a good way.  I won't give it away, and maybe I'm just jaded from reading too much SF over the years, but I pretty much hate episodes 49-51 because of that twist.

On the plus side, Scar, Lust and the other humunculi get some great character development.  On the negative side, the ultimate villain (since every show needs one I guess) and resolution to the show are great disappointments.  I'm not averse to bittersweet endings, but I am averse to silly plot twists thrown in with no foreshadowing or thought to how they'd really affect the mechanics of the setting.  I really wanted to love this show, I really did.  And I do love it, up until about halfway through.

Keep it coming guys!

Boring story and whinny main characters. Some love this anime and honestly I don't know why. Aside from a few villians that make a few choice episodes worth watching it's 20+ episodes or so of ""let's get my brothers body back"" and ""I lost my right arm and leg"" over and over and over again. If there was every a story that I didn't care about in an anime this was definitely it. This might of been a more interesting anime if the characters didn't whine all the time. I especially can't stand the Suit of armor who sounds like a 5-6 year old kid. Maybe it's the voice acting or maybe he is supposed to be 5-6 I don't know. Between Cowboy Bebop and Full metal Alchemist I don't know which anime Cartoon network hasn't played to death. I wish they brought back Vash the Stampede or Wolf's Rain. This anime just doesn't do it for me. It's too cartoony, and then it tries to be extremely serious. It's like if you mixed ""Elfin Lied"" with ""One-Piece"" you'd end up with a silly cartoonish/and seriously violent Anime like this. Some people like the style... Honestly I never cared for it. As goofy as the characters are it seems they always try to make scenes to strike out emotions in the viewer. The only emotion these sentimental scenes brought out in me was anger...anger at the fact that these characters whine and cry about something every other episode. I wish they were just a sub plot and the main story was about that ""Scar"" guy. He seems like an anime based around him would be much more interesting to watch...plus he doesn't whine.",1289692800,2,1640,4.4485049833887045

3081911,5,B00127R2WY,"""Fullmetal Alchemist"" follows the adventures of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, in a parallel world called Amestris, which closely resembles our own. There is one fundamental difference: in Amestris, the science of alchemy has superceded all of our sciences in importance. It's obvious why: alchemy combines all of them. If you understand the composition of matter, you can almost instantly take something--lead, say, or dirt--and create gold or flowers out of it. Matter is matter; matter of any kind can become matter of anything. There is one rule to this science, however: the law of equivalent exchange. To gain, something of equal value must be lost. The one exception to this rule is life: there is no matter of any kind that can be traded for life.

After the sudden death of their mother, Edward and Alphonse ignore this crucial rule, and try to bring her back. The attempt ends in disaster: Alphonse loses his human body, and Edward is maimed. The creature they made is nothing like their mother: it is a monster.

In order to restore Al's body, Edward has no alternative but to find the Philosopher's Stone, the only object on earth that can skirt the rule of equivalent exchange. However, the military is the only organization with real information on the Stone. So, in order to obtains what he needs, Edward must join the military--losing most of his freedom in the process. It's equivalent exchange all over again.

In the second season, the consequences grow more dire, the storylines deeper, more emotional, more moving, and more tragic. Pursued by evil, inhuman creatures known as the Homunculi who are also after the Stone, Edward ends up separated from Alphonse, and the two brothers embark on individual, parallel courses in order to do what they must, courses that could end the life of one or both before their goal is reached--or before they ever see each other again.

""Fullmetal Alchemist"" has a brilliant story populated with brilliant characters. Both the plot and the people are among the best I have ever encountered in a fictional work of any kind. I'm not even an anime fan; I stumbled on this because I thought the story sounded cool. It's beyond cool; I don't often use this word, but I will repeat: it is brilliant.

3315941,5,B00127R2WY,"SOME SPOILERS ARE CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW

Fullmetal Alchemist is an amazing series, but one of its greatest achievements, in my mind, is that it managed to not only maintain its stellar quality over time, it consistently got better and better until it actually hurt to see the series come to an end. Seeing all of the plot threads that have been building throughout the whole series coming to fruition is a great payoff, sure, but it's made all the better by the fact that nothing feels like a cop-out; there wasn't a single moment where I thought ""Oh, these guys were running out of time and so they just threw that up there."" No, everything flows to a logical, incredibly satisfying and poignantly melancholy conclusion. It certainly isn't a Hollywood-style happy ending, but that was never what the series was about in the first place. And even more gratifying than the ending was being able to look back on how all of these characters had grown and changed throughout the series: Lust springs to mind first and foremost, having gone from being your stereotypical femme-fatale to a multi-layered, incredibly sympathetic and tragic heroine. And I never, ever thought I'd be able to empathize with a psychopathic monster like Envy, but the final scenes of episode 50 made me come really close to doing so, even as he... well, I won't spoil it for you here.

In short, Fullmetal Alchemist is an incredibly well done, superbly animated and acted show. The Japanese and English voice tracks are both equally impressive (one of the RARE few animes in which this has happened, the only other to my knowledge being Samurai Champloo). And sure, if you're reading this product description you're probably going to buy this anyway and you've seen the series before, but in case you haven't, just know that you're about to see some of the finest episodes of one of the best anime series ever. This world definitely goes out with a bang, and not a whimper.",1206489600,7,1948,4.760355029585799

3316046,5,B00127R2WY,"This is my (and a lot of other anime fans) all time favorite anime series (for good reason).  If you are an anime fan and have not yet seen this anime, what are you doing with your life?  You NEED to watch this.  It is a must watch for any anime lover.  It has an amazing story, great characters, beautiful music, and a nice art style.

Don't get this confused with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  They are different series.  This one originally aired while the manga was still going so about half way through the series they took some liberties and took the story in their own direction. Brotherhood on the other hand, came out after the manga had finished and follows the manga story very closely.  If you are only willing to watch one, I recommend Brotherhood over this one but they are both masterpieces in my mind.

The second series is mostly plot.  Not a lot of character development or anything.  It will seem like a bad resolution to some but that is because this is not where the series ends.  You will want to watch the move: Conqueror of Shambala for the resolution of the series.  Not nearly as good a finale as the Brotherhood one but still recommend it.",1424736000,,1171,4.466981132075472

In this version the ""FMA"" manga wasn't completed while the anime was being produced so they basically followed the manga and then made they're own ending as they went on. ""FMA:Brotherhood"" follows the manga completely which is why many more people prefer the newer version to this version. I don't disagree either, the remake has a better story line, better animation, crisper drawings. Hands down brotherhood beats this version, but it doesn't make this version any less great. Its still the same badass anime and any true FMA fan has seen both! Highly recommend!",1409097600,,734,5.024590163934426

The action and plot really heat up for the second half of this show, but the comedy is thankfully not left in the dust. The animation and musical scores are perfect, There is just so much to praise about this series that I just can't put it all here. Now for the flaws, The ending, the last 4-5 episodes move much to fast, and story suffers or it. Major plot twists occur, instead of being wrapped up, and so much new information is thrown at the viewer that we may have to slow down and just take it all in. The conclusion is good and satisfying though, even if it leaves some large plot holes and unanswered questions (thankfully answered in the wrap up movie Conqueror of Shamballa). Also there is FMA:B which kind of obscures this series in its' shadow.

3316139,4,B00127R2WY,"The manga so good, they had to film it twice!
Season 2 of the ""original"" (which is to say, first) anime version of Fullmetal Alchemist covers about volumes 5-7 of the manga, and then goes off in its own direction, since the manga wasn't complete.  After watching this set a second time, I still think that once you get past episode 8 or 9 of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Brotherood becomes the better anime.  Brotherhood makes more sense overall, and the Father, Wrath, and Pride of Brotherhood are better characters than the Dante, Pride, and Wrath of the original series.  Also, this series is incomplete, and you really need to watch Conqueror of Shamballa to get a resolution to the plotline.

On the other hand, Season 1 of the original anime is better than the first 8 or 9 episodes of Brotherhood, and this Season 2 is still a lot better than much of the anime out there (in my limited experience.)

3316249,5,B00127R2WY,"I have been an FMA fan since its early days on Adult Swim--and to be fair, I have owned this original series, own the entire manga series and also own Brotherhood and BOTH theatrical releases. I'd say I'm in a position to make a pretty fair judgement on the two series...and I personally believe the Original Series outshines the manga/FMA-B, even though the manga/FMA-B are the 'authorized vision"" of the original creator, Arakawa...but hear me out on this, please.

The Manga, whose story diverges from THIS original series after the encounter between Hughes and Envy, was far from completed when this series was developed. The original anime was created with the author's full approval and cooperation. Arakawa even revealed the final plot elements that would conclude the story and there are some references to them if you're familiar with both stories (ex: Mustang's 'vision', the Ed's alchemic abilities at the end of both stories,etc). However, it was clear that the series would be one side of the FMA story, while Arakawa's as-yet-not-even-half-finished masterpiece would continue.

What is the essential difference--plot and characters aside? Why is the Original Series considered to be better by so many fans?
Simple. FMA The Manga/FMA Brotherhood was published in a young teen monthly manga digest(Shounen Gangan). It was aimed at a target audience of young people and older children, even though it became hugely popular world wide with audiences of all ages. The Original Series seems to be shooting for an older viewing audience, and the developed scripts and storyline and plotting reflect that.

The manga's 'evil' was a meglomaniac supernatural being unleashed upon the world and determined to become a god, with humanity as little more than a useable resource. Like Dragonball Z, our heroes have to ""go Super Saiyan"" to save the world. For a Shounen/Young Adult manga plotline, that's workable. Some adult readers/viewers may find it formulaic and may feel dissatisifed by the neat,""happily ever after"" elements of the awkward ending. It's man vs Supernatural Menace.

The evil in the Original Series comes from within the human nature. The quest for immortality that triggers the events in the manga (the King of Xerxes and the Creature in the Flask) is scaled on a human level--Dante and Hohenheim's quest for eternal life. It is humans that create the Sins through the folly of attempting to return the dead to life--not a supernatural madman and his human minions. At every turn, evil is the consequence of human greed, hubris and ignorance and nothing will ever match the horror of Edward learning the truth about Sloth and his helplessness in the face of that truth. Time and again, it all falls back on human responsiblity and human failure...and is redeemed by humans willing to sacrifice anything and everything to restore the balance again.

It's that depth of storytelling, for me personally, places this original series above the manga/brotherhood storyline. Rather than the vision of the comic artist, it is the work of screen writers and I find it far more compelling. I'm sure a lot of people will strongly disagree and Funimation is certainly doing all it can to get the original series out of the catalog and out of memory--but it won't work for the fans that love this--which is why I bought two complete series box sets--one to watch and one to lend to friends.

This has no ""happy"" ending--it is bittersweet and stunning and ultimately satisfying.",1361664000,,3486,5.064459930313589

This was an anime that has received so much attention and i'd heard about it so much i started watching it. Now some shows like Naruto are just overrated ( not trying to hate on i do actually like it)But with FMA it's not just about the action, it's about the story.  The characters are very real, there emotions are extremely understandable and i have developed a bond with them. The second season shows more about Ed and Al, but it also goes more into Roy, Riza, Winry and and the homoculous,if it's misspelled i'm sorry. I think the homoculous are the most ingenious villains ever created, their evil and don't care for anyone but themselves, however the lives most of them lived before they died were awful. My personal favorites Envy! The ending of the series doesn't follow the manga as i'm sure most of you know but it does a fantastic job of creating an original ending and if you want the manga faithful series try FMA: Brotherhood(I haven't seen Brotherhood yet, i'm going to start it soon. If your wondering what's a good age to start this i'd say 13, 14 and up. This show's intense has a lot of scary, violent moments, and cursing. Also there are some parts that might make very religious people upset ( in one episode Roy says ""there is no god""). I highly recommend this show you will not be dissapointed by it, and if you love it like i did Watch Brotherhood i heard it's good as well.

3316359,3,B00127R2WY,"Ok, I'll confess, I'm a latecomer to the FMA franchise and actually started off watching Brotherhood first, knowing full well how the two series differed. Still I didn't want to make any judgements about the original anime series without watching it to completion. So after finishing FMA:Brotherhood, I set down and watch the entire original 51 ep TV series and while I can recognize how this was quite a good series when it originally came out in 2003 and there was no complete manga story yet, having watched it now in 2011 with a complete manga storyline, I cannot help but be unimpressed and frankly dissapointed with the conclusion of the original series.

As many know, the first half of the series followed whatever manga storyline was written at the time and they stretched out that material as far as they could go, about 25 eps. By the time they had to produce the final half, they had no manga storyline to base on so credit to the director and writer, they crafted an original storyline taking characters in a far different direction than would be written in the manga. It's easy to tell how this storyline was being made up as it went along because it frankly meandered, was quite directionless at time and stuffed with pointless filler as the screenwriters were trying decide where the story was going. Compared to Brotherhood, there were many gripes I had about the 2nd half of this show:

1. The Philosopher's Stone - unlike Brotherhood where that no longer became the main point of the story as it moved onto something far more important and grand, this was still the central focus and somewhat plot-driving MacGuffin of the original series. Seriously? You couldn't develop the story any further than that? At the end our main villain Dante was still trying to produce a Philosopher's Stone because she couldn't make her own.

2. Dante - Ok, this main villain was frankly quite weak, especially compared to the devious genius of Father from the second series. Her motivations were small in scope and rather pathetic, leading to an even more pathetic end.

3. The Homunculi - the original incarnations had some interesting points to them, including the personal journey of Lust, who was actually much more one dimensional in the new series, but that was probably done because she was such a prominent character in this series. But I found all the original incarnations of Pride, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Greed to be less well written and interesting.

4. Ed & Al - was it my imagination or we're our main heroes far more annoying and immature compared to their characterization in Brotherhood? Ed was about the same but more headstrong and bullheaded in the original series, and Al, my he was incredibly annoying, childish and short sighted. The Brotherhood incarnation of Al had a maturity, quick-thinking and intelligence beyond the years of his 10 year old sounding voice and frankly a very likeable and cool character. The original series Al was simply a child and thought like one.

5. The setting - You really don't see much of this world except of parts of Amnestris and some slivers of Ishbal, but both nations, as well as other nations of Drachma, Xing and the dead kingdom of Xerxes were far more fleshed out in the new series, leading to a much more vivid, rich and detailed, believable world. In the original series, you barely know anything about the history and culture of the nation where this series takes place and frankly by the end of the series, you learn little more about it than when you started.

I could go on but I've made my point pretty clear that Brotherhood really uncovers a lot of the weaknesses of the 2nd half of this original series.",1303516800,4,3682,4.734789391575663

3316384,4,B00127R2WY,"Re-post from season one review.
Really, the quality of this anime is top notch, and used to be the bar that other anime were measured against. The animation, characters, and story are second to none. A five star anime.
That is, until Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood came out. To make room, this one had to be dropped down to four stars. Now Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood holds the rank of being *the* 5 star anime. But that is because Brotherhood exceeded it, not because it is any less worthy than before.

Fullmetal Alchemist parallels Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for the first half, about. Basically, all the development chapters. At that point, they diverge greatly. Story has it that by the time they got to the midway point, they had caught up with the manga as far as it had been published, and from there on had to create a new story. The story they created was magnificent, with meaning and depth, with conflicts and struggles both internal and external. This is an anime that I feel comfortable suggesting to just about anyone, with one cautioned exception.

If you are a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I can't recommended this storyline. While this may be one of the best anime I have seen, Brotherhood exceeded this in so many ways that this one will probably be disappointing.
But to everyone else, I advise you watch this series (including the Conquerer of Shambala), wait about a month or two for it to settle, and then go get Brotherhood.",1297555200,,1473,4.818181818181818
3316385,5,B00127R2WY,"Fullmetal Alchemist The Complete Second Season is a four-disc set that contains episodes twenty-six through fifty-one of the series.  The first disc contains seven episodes, the second disc contains six episodes, the third disc contains six episodes, and the fourth disc contains six episodes, a commentary on episode fifty-one, and the extras.  On the discs, you can watch with either English or Japanese audio, and you can choose whether or not to have the English subtitles.

The first extra included on the fourth disc is a thirty-one minute documentary titled, ""The Transmutation of a Phenomenon.""  This documentary includes interviews with some of the actors for the English dub, and they talk about various aspects of the series and their characters.

The next feature is labeled as ""Square Enix Commercial.""  It runs for two minutes, and is an ad for the Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir videogame.  The third special feature on the disc is the textless openings and closings.  This feature includes two of the openings and two of the closings for the series.  Unlike the first box set, you don't get the English subtitles on the openings and closings if you're watching with Japanese audio.  The final extra are trailers for Project Blue Earth SOS, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Glass Fleet, Ragnarok, Tsubasa, and Case Closed.

When this DVD set was put together, FUNimation included the booklets from the seven individual discs that were released that included these episodes.  The first booklet starts with episode twenty-five, which was released on the first Fullmetal Alchemist box set.  Outside of that, everything else lines up.  Each booklet contains at least one write-up from someone involved with the series (the first six booklets contain a write-up from one of the Japanese voice actors, while the final booklet contains write-ups from two of the actors from the English dub who also directed the dubbing sessions).  There is also character information and images, information from the series, artwork, and episode write-ups.  The booklets are very well-done and contain a lot of information.

The quality of the series continues to be very high on this box set.  That, along with the quality of the booklets, make this a release worth owning.  If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist who wants to own the whole series on DVD, then this box set should be part of your anime collection.

In order to write this review, I watched a copy of this DVD box set that was given to me as a gift by my husband.",1297123200,36,2551,4.943661971830986
3316386,3,B00127R2WY,"Oh, what happened to you, FMA?  The first season is so good, so epic!  And then the second season becomes so bogged down, so slow, and ends with the stupidest plot twist which nearly ruins the whole show!  Sure, it seems to start out strong, and introduces one of the most kickenest of all teachers ever, Izumi, and really starts picking up the pace with Greed and his chimera crew.  And then slows it down again with Wrath and filler.  The pacing slingshots like that, alternating between exciting and boring but not doing much to advance the plot for about ten episodes before finally starting the build to the finale.  And what a disappointing finale it was.  The twist in regards to the truth behind the Gate just calls into question all you thought you knew about the world of FMA, and not in a good way.  I won't give it away, and maybe I'm just jaded from reading too much SF over the years, but I pretty much hate episodes 49-51 because of that twist.

On the plus side, Scar, Lust and the other humunculi get some great character development.  On the negative side, the ultimate villain (since every show needs one I guess) and resolution to the show are great disappointments.  I'm not averse to bittersweet endings, but I am averse to silly plot twists thrown in with no foreshadowing or thought to how they'd really affect the mechanics of the setting.  I really wanted to love this show, I really did.  And I do love it, up until about halfway through.

Keep it coming guys!

Boring story and whinny main characters. Some love this anime and honestly I don't know why. Aside from a few villians that make a few choice episodes worth watching it's 20+ episodes or so of ""let's get my brothers body back"" and ""I lost my right arm and leg"" over and over and over again. If there was every a story that I didn't care about in an anime this was definitely it. This might of been a more interesting anime if the characters didn't whine all the time. I especially can't stand the Suit of armor who sounds like a 5-6 year old kid. Maybe it's the voice acting or maybe he is supposed to be 5-6 I don't know. Between Cowboy Bebop and Full metal Alchemist I don't know which anime Cartoon network hasn't played to death. I wish they brought back Vash the Stampede or Wolf's Rain. This anime just doesn't do it for me. It's too cartoony, and then it tries to be extremely serious. It's like if you mixed ""Elfin Lied"" with ""One-Piece"" you'd end up with a silly cartoonish/and seriously violent Anime like this. Some people like the style... Honestly I never cared for it. As goofy as the characters are it seems they always try to make scenes to strike out emotions in the viewer. The only emotion these sentimental scenes brought out in me was anger...anger at the fact that these characters whine and cry about something every other episode. I wish they were just a sub plot and the main story was about that ""Scar"" guy. He seems like an anime based around him would be much more interesting to watch...plus he doesn't whine.",1289692800,2,1640,4.4485049833887045

Well getting passed my personal preference, I gave this boxset four stars because though its not the real storyline it still tells the story in a good way.
It has great voice acting for the characters as well.
And the price I got it for (around $35) wasn't that bad.

The second season takes up where the first leaves off, with the brothers trying to find a way to fix their bodies with the help of alchemy's fabled Philosopher's Stone.

3316408,5,B00127R2WY,"""Fullmetal Alchemist"" follows the adventures of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, in a parallel world called Amestris, which closely resembles our own. There is one fundamental difference: in Amestris, the science of alchemy has superceded all of our sciences in importance. It's obvious why: alchemy combines all of them. If you understand the composition of matter, you can almost instantly take something--lead, say, or dirt--and create gold or flowers out of it. Matter is matter; matter of any kind can become matter of anything. There is one rule to this science, however: the law of equivalent exchange. To gain, something of equal value must be lost. The one exception to this rule is life: there is no matter of any kind that can be traded for life.

After the sudden death of their mother, Edward and Alphonse ignore this crucial rule, and try to bring her back. The attempt ends in disaster: Alphonse loses his human body, and Edward is maimed. The creature they made is nothing like their mother: it is a monster.

In order to restore Al's body, Edward has no alternative but to find the Philosopher's Stone, the only object on earth that can skirt the rule of equivalent exchange. However, the military is the only organization with real information on the Stone. So, in order to obtains what he needs, Edward must join the military--losing most of his freedom in the process. It's equivalent exchange all over again.

In the second season, the consequences grow more dire, the storylines deeper, more emotional, more moving, and more tragic. Pursued by evil, inhuman creatures known as the Homunculi who are also after the Stone, Edward ends up separated from Alphonse, and the two brothers embark on individual, parallel courses in order to do what they must, courses that could end the life of one or both before their goal is reached--or before they ever see each other again.

""Fullmetal Alchemist"" has a brilliant story populated with brilliant characters. Both the plot and the people are among the best I have ever encountered in a fictional work of any kind. I'm not even an anime fan; I stumbled on this because I thought the story sounded cool. It's beyond cool; I don't often use this word, but I will repeat: it is brilliant.
