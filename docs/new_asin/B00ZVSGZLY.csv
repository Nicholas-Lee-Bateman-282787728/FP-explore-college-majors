This DVD is a re-release of the previous DVD which came out a few years after Rodrigos death in 1999 at the age of 97. The documentary itself was recorded in 1992 to mark the composers 90th birthday and the supporting performance of the Aranjuez concerto was made in studio conditions by Philips also in 1992.

Having not owned either the documentary or the concert element before it is not possible to make a comparative comment. However both offer imaging and sound perfectly comparable with good quality SD productions of that period and should not be a cause for undue concern. This is particularly true of the documentary which is uniquely unrepeatable as Rodrigo himself has since died and 23 years later such intimate illustrations of day to day life within the Rodrigo family group centred on the composer are clearly no longer valid.

What we have here are considerable portraits of the relationships between Rodrigos direct family members, his wife, daughter and grand-daughters, as they work constantly to provide on-going purpose in the ageing composers life. This frequently takes the form of recollections of a wide range of musical triggers which are also of interest for anyone else interested in the composer, his life and his compositions.

Another main contributor to the documentary, arguably the main musical contributor, is the composers  close friend, the guitarist Pepe Romero who clearly had a deep and mutual empathy with the composer. It is unlikely that anyone listening to his detailed description of the meaning of the Aranjuez concerto slow movement could ever listen to it ever again in any other way, however much they had previously admired other performances that did not reflect these insights. Further insights are offered by the conductor Raymond Calcraft and the violinist Agustin Leon Ara with attendant performances of relevant works or sections. There is also an enjoyable except from San Juan y Pascua written for soprano, recorder, vihuela and cornetto which provides an example of a modern usage of historical instruments.

Rodrigos blindness was the result of contracting diphtheria as a child. He was one of only two local survivors and his blindness became total early in his marriage to his wife, a devoted and musical supporter in every conceivable way. It is curious that his music is so central to a land that he could not experience visually. This was achieved through a wide range of musical compositions ranging from the Aranjuez concerto through much solo work for guitar to zarzuelas and various religious works.

The performance of the complete Aranjuez concerto is given by Pepe Romero accompanied by the Academy of St-Martin-in-the-Fields conducted by Marriner. This clearly an authentic rendering of a work that Pepe has had intimate knowledge of and shared with the composer. It is therefore frustrating that so much of the camera work strays away from the performers and off into what would have been thought of as relevant Spanish scenes and scenery. There will be those who would consider that filming the actual performers throughout might have been more relevant and also a lost opportunity. However, as a pictorially illustrated version of the concerto this is well done. There is always the option to switch off the picture and listen to the good stereo sound without distraction as one would do with a CD.

In summary, this disc offers an invaluable portrait of the composer filmed in reflection with much to offer the interested viewer",1440633600,4,3780,5.245033112582782
