8184850,5,B000OFOM50,Nice video poor quality picture but good info,1419984000,,45,4.75
8184851,1,B000OFOM50,"The video shows an experienced welder using stick arc welding to weld plates together. No coverage of stick selection by size or type, no information on how to insure a strong weld with good penetration, no mention of how best to weld materials of different thicknesses, and no information on using wire arc welding equipment.

One would be better off watching a couple of Youtube videos than buying this video on DVD or even buying a book with photos.",1347667200,4,452,4.7215189873417724
8184852,5,B000OFOM50,"This is without a doubt the best welding video I have ever seen, okay it's the only welding video I've ever seen, but it's excellent all the way. It's great for beginers like me with no experience what so ever in welding. It's very easy to understand all the information that gets presented. I had never welded before and after seing this video I really felt comfortable giving it a try. I can't recommend this video enough.",1332374400,,424,4.51948051948052
8184853,3,B000OFOM50,This tutorial is a bit rough on the edges but for the price still gives some good information.,1225065600,3,94,4.277777777777778
8184854,5,B000OFOM50,"Excellent:  I knew nothing about welding and purchased this book before buying my first welder.  I decided to jump straight to TIG.  Again, this is an excellent resource.",1218153600,3,170,5.0
8184855,4,B000OFOM50,"At first I thought that I was watching ""Red Neck Welding"" but it turns out this video has lots of good, practical information for the novice/intermediate welder. The photography is great, givings insights that you just can't get from reading a manual. I'm glad I bought it!",1184803200,7,273,4.829787234042553
