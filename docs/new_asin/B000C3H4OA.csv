8095586,5,B000C3H4OA,Really important information on depleted uranium!,1502668800,,49,7.333333333333333
8095587,5,B000C3H4OA,"The consequence of the first 'nuclear-weapon' was that the radio-isotopes ""aerosolizes"" as the speed of 3,000 feet per second accelerates; and, at impact, thus becomes a micro-sized particulate amassed nuclear-dust. I've, personally met, all the researcgh-persons involved in doing writing this book, which became a video that covers more and exposes the truths justifiably, best--in 1990's--last century. We know the contamination spreads by winds, soaks by rains, and is not exponentially getting better, because radionuclides do not dissipate. The poison remains resuspended and increases its traits of nuclear-Moelucar nano-Particles.

That these people speak-out about hazards, and that I have learned and furthered the definition of 1945 invention for nuclear-Murder, protested specifically against BOTH nuclear-Weapons starting in 1957, my own life has found the victimizing by the user is never useful, causes blowback, and is backwards. The birth of habitable planets, is now being reversed, as that of radioactive-decays ""reduces the volume, but not the particle exponentially"". Thus, the particles to a so-called ""natural-radioactive background level"" as a new-Template, has been increased and will take billions of years to disappear. The normal was reached sometime in the past century and has been understood, but not completely measured--this is what I've attempted to infuse w our society by my protests and speaking-out, as government continues to be abuse, of citizenry here, and civilians abroad!

Those affected, as well as those who have researched the ""dirty ole military weapons of total IM-punity"" are not guilty of deception, as the wanton disregard is shown and pout-forth in words by soldiers who were involved. All high schoolers can understand how dastardly the waste of humans to cancers and the poisons of particulate-Matter: anti-matter! Shame on illegal invasions for profiteers, too!",1421539200,,1917,5.722807017543859
8095588,5,B000C3H4OA,"The radiation community has not fully recognized the health risks associated with depleted uranium. The birth defects in the US of exposed solders in the middle east wars and birth defects in Iraq near areas of highest exposure to burned up depleted uranium weaponry have shown significant increases - while radiation community continues to state that there is no human evidence of genetic effects from radiation. The truth matters. This DVD is important viewing as the military use of depleted uranium has harmed solders and citizens, and adequate prevention, information about health risks, monitoring of contaminated areas, medical diagnostic testing for internal Du, and health care is denied.",1403568000,,697,5.462962962962963
8095589,3,B000C3H4OA,"Nothing is more important than knowing about Depleted Uranium, but this dvd could be a little deeper.

The shipper was fast, but this info can be seen online.

I hope more and better DU movies come, soon, but at least, this is something about DU, now.",1298160000,,251,4.434782608695652
8095590,5,B000C3H4OA,"Exactly as described on Amazon. It actually was wrapped in a double plastic film.
Very fast shipping.
Thanks.",1269734400,,109,5.111111111111111
8095591,5,B000C3H4OA,"DO NOT MISS THIS DOCUMENTARY! Radioactive Depleted Uranium weapons used on our own troops? - not to mention innocent civilians?  And - features Sadam's main man, Ramsey Clark! Very timely.

I saw this film at some screening in NYC. If you like films such as Fog of War, and Hearts & Minds ....

A Must....",1134259200,18,305,4.509090909090909
