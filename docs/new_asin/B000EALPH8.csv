If you're a big Joe Rogan fan pick this up, but if you're new to his standup start off getting his specials ""Joe Rogan Live"" and ""Talking Monkeys In Space"".  And if you STILL can't get enough of Joe Rogan be sure to check out his podcast at joerogan.net and itunes, its very funny stuff.

8107942,4,B000EALPH8,"When a friend of mine recommended I check out Joe Rogan, I put off watching his standup for quite a while. There was no way 'that guy from Fear Factor' could be good. I was wrong. Joe Rogan is a great stand-up comic, and it sucks he isn't synonymous with it. This guy deserves an HBO special for sure. This DVD is very funny, but his more recent one 'Joe Rogan Live' is a lot better. The sound quality on this one is also not as good.",1210464000,8,434,4.0
