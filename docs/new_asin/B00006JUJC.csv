7970711,1,B00006JUJC,"They had a great lineup of teachers here, but both segments of this DVD deal with rods, lines, casting, etc.  I learned NOTHING about how to bonefish from this DVD.  It was a waste of money.  If you want instruction on fly casting, it could be helpful, but there are plenty of other videos out there.",1197244800,2,300,4.321428571428571
7970712,3,B00006JUJC,"I'm an intermediate level caster with limited experience in flats fishing and thought this DVD might be a good learning tool.

I picked up a few tips but found the information to be a bit unorganized and thought the fishing scenes took up space where actual instruction could have been substituted. I would not use this as a single source to prepare for a trip but might be a good addition to other books, DVD's etc.",1136937600,2,416,4.473684210526316

7970714,1,B00006JUJC,"I would agree with the reviewer who said ""I would have liked to see more bonefish though instead of people talking about basics on reels, rods and lines.""
If you need basic instruction in casting technique, this DVD may actually be helpful.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for bonefishing strategy and tactics, you'll be very disappointed.
I had hoped for actual bonefishing (as opposed to casting) instruction, but, while there was a very short section on ""fishing conditions"" sandwiched between rod modulus and double-hauling, there was precious little.  In fact, the best this DVD has to offer for actual bonefishing technique may be a part of the brief introduction when we overhear a guide giving some advice to an angler casting to a bonefish while wading.
In any case, it would appear that the video was more concerned with promoting the bonefish school of the title than providing instruction.  Why else would we be subjected to a scene, with description, of a meal in the dining hall, or information about how instructors are rotated at the school?
As if to add insult to injury, the final five minutes of this supposed instructional video were spent watching Steve Rajeff crank on his reel while fighting a permit.  Where is the instructional value in that? I've already seen more than enough of that sort of thing in tiresome home videos.
Again, if you want actual fishing advice, save your 30 bucks.",1077148800,8,1419,4.851239669421488
7970715,4,B00006JUJC,There are lots of destination videos out there but very few instructional how to fish Saltwater. I will recommend this to my friends. Good Job!,1044576000,,143,4.76
7970716,4,B00006JUJC,"I've been fly fishing for 15 years or so and just started saltwater fly fishing recently.  i found the DVD to be extremely informative and some of the best saltwater casting instruction I've ever seen.  This is obviously older video, so the colors are alittle washed out, but the value of the instruction and ease of navigating through the material more than makes up for the older video.
For anyone who wants to improve their skills in saltwater fly fishing, this is an absolute 'must buy"" item.",1044576000,2,496,4.689655172413793
7970717,2,B00006JUJC,"I ordered this DVD right away when I saw it was available.
It was a big mistake. I had hoped this DVD would have the same quality as Bennett-Watts ""The new flyfishing basics"" but it looks like a cheap transfer from plain video. You will not find any HD widescreen content on this disc.
My recollection of tropical waters are of blue waterscapes. I often thought this disc was shot in grey video instead of color.
The quality of the video is poor, in my opinion a waste of the DVD medium.
This is not a destination video but a how-to exercise, I would have liked to see more bonefish though instead of people talking about basics on reels, rods and lines. Those subjects are already properly discussed in the new flyfishing basics DVD.
Too much tech-talk and not enough fishing for my taste.
What really put me off in the beginning of this DVD was the lack of interest of the Bonefish school kids. One guy in particular was busy unpacking his reelcase why a speaker was explaining fishing rods from bamboo to graphite. I found some of the camera positions in this video very weird, like seeing this guy being more interested in fiddling with his reels then listening to the speaker. Maybe the cameraguy had one to many drinks at the time.
A real dissapointment from Bennet-Watt. I had expected high quality video from them but instead they seem to rush their old video material on DVD. My only good DVD that has saltwater flyfishing content on it still remains ""Rex Hunt in the top end"" from Australia's Rex Hunt. It is a PAL DVD and a reminder to all those fishing video makers out there how to do the job properly.",1039219200,,1615,4.477966101694915
