2620447,4,B000GY728I,"well done set, in glorious b&w. Warner Oland was the best Charlie of the lot. I recall watching as a youngster and admiring Mr. Chan's acumen and cleverness, how he was scrupulously non-violent for a detective and how he simply smiled at the foolish behavior of others who addressed him with chinese satirical remarks.

Not being Chinese, I cannot hope to understand the dismay that these films generate among some Chinese-Americans, feeling instead that he was heroic (although it's understandable that no Chinese played the detective).

The storylines are crisp, not overly long and present a bon afide air of mystery and suspense, not found in the latter Chans. Boris Karloff is very errie in ""at the Opera"" . A must for fans and newcomers alike.",1168300800,7,749,4.936507936507937
2620448,3,B000GY728I,"There were more than forty made between 1931 and 1949, Swedish actor Warner Oland appearing in 16 of them, Sidney Toler in 22 and Roland Winters in a round half dozen...

Before the appearance of Chan, screen Orientals were often portrayed as being subhuman, always the villain and never the hero... If producers wanted a villain of the deadliest kind, then they chose an Oriental Chan, and to a lesser extent, other Eastern detectives like Mr. Wong (Boris Karloff) and Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) changed all that and helped make the celluloid ""Wily Oriental Gentleman"" more respectable...

Shrewd, courteous and slow moving, Chan's trademark was a cut price wisdom, expressed throughout all his films in phrases like ""Too many mixed drinks make big headaches,"" and ""Silence is golden except in police station.""

Like Vance and other popular detectives he would gather his suspects in one room, going round each in turn and finally pointing to the guilty person with the words: ""You murderer."" As much of his detection was based on bluff as on deduction; the condemned criminal might well have been better advised to stand his ground and challenge Chan to prove his case rather than make the traditional break for freedom...

The film that is widely regarded as being one of the best Chan films is Bruce Humberstone's ""Charlie Chan at the Opera."" Not unlike a poor man's ""Phantom of the Opera"" it has Boris Karloff (in this case not the villain, just a red herring) as an operatic tenor suffering from aphasia (psychosomatic dumbness) who escapes from a mental asylum bent on revenge on his double-crossing opera singer wife... The wife duly dies and so too does her operatic lover but on this occasion the murderer is not Karloff but someone less obvious...

The old Chinaman is true to form, making the police look even more heavily and slowly than usual (""Oh, no, we're not calling Chop Suey again,"" groans Sergeant William Demarest) and dropping his verbal gems at every twist and turn... Although set within the normal 70 minute formula for the Chan films it is faster paced than most in the series combining thrills and music and including a special opera, Carnival, composed for the film by Oscar Levant...

Stars who appeared in the series and later became famous included Rita Hayworth (then Cansino), Ray Milland, George Brent and Cesar Romero...",1166745600,16,2352,4.9267676767676765
2620449,5,B000GY728I,"I love the Chan movies, but Fox is doing it again! They released only 4 movies in Vol. 1 and now 4 movies in Vol. 2. Since each Chan movie is no longer than 80 minutes, they could easily put 2 movies on each disc or even on each side of a disc. Fox feels the need to get every penny out of the public that they can. SHAME ON YOU, FOX!",1165795200,36,334,3.6527777777777777
2620450,5,B000GY728I,"Volume 2 in Fox's Charlie Chan DVD Collection seems not to have been released as much as it escaped. Volume 1 was widely heralded but this installment, which contains the best of the films when the series reached its peak, sort of snuck up on us. Frankly, I can't believe I'm the first one here to review it.

Full disclosure: I own Volume 1 and just purchased Volume 2 through Amazon. So my review at this point is based on my (repeated) TV viewings dating back to the mid 1960s through just a few years ago before the Fox Movie Channel banned the CC films. I noticed that Fox skipped one film in this set, CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET (1936) that preceeded the four films in Volume 2. Why? I can only guess except that SECRET is a real letdown compared to the quality of the films before it - CHARLIE CHAN IN... LONDON, PARIS, EGYPT, and SHANGHAI. And the films that followed that are represented in Volume 2.  But still why was it dropped?  I guess that's Fox's secret.

As with Volume 1, Warner Oland simply IS Charlie Chan. Oland continues to play Chan with his usual quiet authority and stunning charisma. Although he was not Asian (athough he believed his mother was part Mongolian), his winning characterization of Chan forever changed the way Asians would be portrayed in Hollywood films.

As for the Fab Four in this set: CC AT THE CIRCUS is the closest Charlie came to film noir, thanks to German director Harry Lachman. His films tended to be dark and moody and CIRCUS is no exception.  Much of the film takes place at night and even indoor scenes have a sombre edge to them. Lachman would direct a few more Chans in the Sidney Toler era during the early 40s when the series changed direction and became compact little murder mysteries such as DEAD MEN TELL (1941). These later Chans are enjoyable on their own terms but totally different in style from the Olands of the mid-30s. CIRCUS features the entire CHAN clan including his wife. Mystery-wise, if you can't spot the real killer in CIRCUS, you should resign your membership in the Charlie Chan club! I think even Charlie knows early on but has nothing to pin on the culprit.

CHARLIE CHAN AT THE RACE TRACK marks a real jazzing up of the series stylistically. Director Bruce Humberstone, who was ambitious for more important projects at Fox, wanted to show Zanuck what he could do and pulled out all the stops in RACE TRACK. Right from the opening music behind the main credits, you know this one is different. The pacing is faster and optical wipes give each scene a sense of urgency. Charlie's relationship with son Lee also progresses with Lee being given increasingly important assignments by his Pop.

Unlike the earlier drawing room style of the films, in RACE TRACK Charlie takes on a whole gambling syndicate in addition to the murders in a wide ranging series of locales from Honolulu, to Melbourne, to Los Angeles, plus an ocean voyage in between. He's shot too! High tech is employed here as Chan learns about the ""new"" way of timing the races with photo-electric cells and photographing the photo finish. What I particularly like in RACE TRACK is that the film ""language"" gives an alert viewer a big clue at one point to put you on the track of the killer. Even at the climax, the killer slips up but nobody notices (momentarily), giving the viewer another chance to solve this one.

AT THE OPERA is generally considered to be the best of the Chans and its reputation is well deserved. Oland for once is co-starred, with Boris Karloff, and the two work well together although they only share one scene. The film might more accurately be titled CHARLIE CHAN MEETS THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA because that really describes the storyline. Since Karloff is so obviously the killer you just know somebody else has to be doing the dirty work and making it look like Karloff's to blame. But Charlie ain't fooled (nor are we because this is supposed to be a murder MYSTERY). High tech again is used to help solve the mystery as we (and Charlie) are treated to a demonstration of the process involved in wire photos.

Son Lee again proves indispensible and Director Humberstone delivers the goods once again. A special faux-opera was written for the film by Oscar Levant called ""Carnival"" and I hate to admit it but I wish Levant had turned it into a real full length work - the music is that good. I don't know who sang for Karloff but in case viewers wonder how his character could manage to sing so well after being a patient in an insane asylum for ten years, the opening scene shows him practicing every night. A bigoted detective comically played by William Demerest finally has to admit that ""Charlie is OK"" at the end. A real gem of a film.

The last one in this set, 1937's CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OLYMPICS (just love that title!), is the most globe-trotting of all the Chans and the most ambitious production-wise. The film starts with Oland in his undershirt jogging in place! The, uh, partial nudity shows that Oland had lost weight around his mid-section when compared with his appearance circa 1934-35. The film starts in Honolulu and has a scene eirily prophetic of the Pacific sea search for Amelia Earhart's lost plane that took place a few months after the film's release. Then Chan is off to intercept the ocean liner Manhattan that is in mid-Atlantic on its way to the Olympic games in Germany (son Lee is on the U.S. swimming team in case you're wondering how he gets worked into the story). Being 1936, the only way Charlie can catch the ship is to fly from Hawaii to L.A., then grab a transcontinental plane to New York, then grab the ill-fated German zepplin Hindenburg from Lake Hurst, NJ. And travelers today think they have it rough!

The plot actually has nothing to do with the Olympics but the film is so engaging, who really cares? The games are used as a backdrop for meetings by the spies with Chan, and there is some footage of the events including Jesse Owens's spectacular run for a gold medal. High tech is employed once more as Charlie pulls a real switcheroo by substituting a radio transmitter in the aircraft device the spies are after. Son Lee is kidnapped from outside the Olympic Stadium, and even Charlie thinks he has met his match.

Actor C. Henry Gordon, an alumnus from earlier Chans, almost steals the film as a most dapper villian.  Things are so dangerous for Charlie that Mr. Gordon, one of the silver screen's silkiest villians, actually saves Chan from death TWICE, and Gordon is one of the bad guys! As in OPERA, the killer is well hidden although the series of clues that Chan puts together to unmask the culprit at the finale is less than convincing. It doesn't matter because the killer can't explain away a simple clue: spilt ink on his shoe and that seals his fate (no, not a spoiler - by the time the ink-on-shoe comes up, the killer is already unmasked - I just think it's the best clue!).

By the time OLYMPICS was made, Warner Oland was really ""into"" the Chan character so much so that he continued speaking like Chan offscreen and even signed his name, ""Charlie Chan."" As one interviewrer wrote in mid-1937, ""I came to interview Warner Oland about Charlie Chan but ended up interviewing Charlie Chan about Warner Oland."" So what was going on?  I'm afraid that's a story to be told in Volume 3. I only hope that the Fox people take this DVD project seriously enough to scour their vaults for ANY materials - film footage but most likely photos - from Oland's final and uncompleted film, CHARLIE CHAN AT THE RINGSIDE, that he worked on during the first week of January 1938.",1165363200,96,7595,4.585851142225497

Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren Ohio in 1884. In high school he founded a monthly magazine and went to Harvard. After graduating he became a newspaper reporter, then turned to writing novels. While on vacation in Honolulu he learned about the exploits of Chang Apana, a Chines detective on the Honolulu police force. Biggers wrote six Charlie Chan novels that were successful. His death from a stroke in 1933 ended his career. Five movies were produced before his death. Over forty movies featured Charlie Chan. They were popular in areas with ethnic Chinese populations. American films were popular also, films that portrayed Chinese in a negative manner were banned in China, such as the Fu Manchu films. Werner Olands Chan movies were popular in China.

In recent times the popularity of detective stories has waned, unless they are on a police force instead of a owner-operator detective, such as Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, etc. How many movies show a private investigator who clears the innocent and reveals the guilty? Warner Oland was the first actor to star in this popular series. This volume contains four movies plus selected background information. For more background read Ken Hankes book Charlie Chan at the Movies, then Yunte Huangs book Charlie Chan. In the 1950's the Charlie Chan movies used to be shown on local television stations but rarely since then. TV prefers films in color instead of the monochrome common to many films before the late 1950's. If youve never seen these movies you should enjoy them as examples of mystery movies. The novels of Biggers are also available. See the individual reviews for more details.

Disc 1: Charlie Chan at the Opera (1936) - personal conflicts lead to murder.
Disc 2: Charlie Chan at the Olympics (1937) - finding a stolen military secret.

2620465,5,B000GY728I,"The four movies in this series are all very good, representative of when 20th Century Fox got everything right in producing the series. The chemistry between Warner Oland and Key Luke (Charlie's number one son, Lee) makes everything they do together seem so natural.  The features included on each DVD are also very interesting and give some behind the scenes information. For instance, stock footage of the 1936 Olympics was used in the movie""Charlie Chan at the Olympics"". But, any images of swastikas was blurred out when the film was made.  Even the swastikas on the tail fins of the dirigible ""Hindenburg""  (that Charlie crossed the Atlantic on)  were blurred out.  I don't know why that would have been done back in 1937 when this movie was made, two years before the start of World War II but it is an interesting fact  found in the Features..",1481155200,2,850,4.7482993197278915

along with the Hindenburg. Even a Nazi salute which was not censored by the movie makers.
What I enjoyed were the featurettes that came with each DVD. Trivia and commentary on the actors and supporting actors and crew.
Priceless information that is well done.
The 'Opera' film for example has music by Oscar Levant written just for this film for the opera scenes.

2620508,4,B000GY728I,"The Charlie Chan series is a nostalgic romp, but as with other Asian detectives (Lorre's Mr. Moto, and Karloff's Mr. Wong) it is a painful reminder of Hollywood's prejudice during the 1930's.  Warner Oland is the only non-Asian in the movie series, and  despite his intelligence and clever detective work is consigned to speaking in Asian parables or disconnected ""sing song"" sentences. The Asian actors speak clearly and distinctly.  It is a little disconcerting.

As with most B Movies, the films are face paced and run about 70 minutes.  As always, you are introduced to a few suspects to the actual murders, but halfway through, the signals are too obvious.

The best of the films, is also the most embarrassingt:  Charlie Chan at the Race Track.  In addition to Chan, as a stable boy, actor John Henry Allen gives the most self demeaning ""Uncle Tom"" performance I have ever seen on film.  Truly embarrassing, and makes me hesitant to refer the film to others.

Yet despite the negative images, and uncomfortable moments, the series is perfect B Movie entertainment, and for film historians, a treasure trove of movie history.  Charlie Chan (usually referred to as ""Cholly"" by other detectives) at the Opera features a most bizarre performance by Boris Karloff, looking like this is his first talking role (after playing monsters).

Allowing for great change occurring in Hollywood's portrayal of minorities, and recognizing we've still a long way to go, the Charlie Chan series is pure entertainment and a closer look at director John Stone's technique in filming the series.",1401494400,,1580,5.0346153846153845

2620517,4,B000GY728I,"The Fox sets have reached Costco, and I got this one for $14.99. My interest in Charlie Chan dates back to ""Bad Detective"" by the Coasters, so readers must pardon my unusual take on things. I just finished viewing Charlie Chan at the Oympics. It seems to be copyright 1937 so it was made well before the war, yet the plot is that a secret device for flying planes by remote control (i.e drones) was being demonstrated for the US Government in the hopes that they would buy it. Three things: one is that private inventors create the invention, secondly they are free to sell it to whomever they choose (they choose the USA first, being patriots), and third, it is clear that the US is preparing for war.

The invention is stolen by agents of an unnamed foreign country, which does not appear to be Germany,  and the chase gets mixed up with the U.S. Olympic team (of which Chan's son is a member) travelling to the Olympics and some of the action takes place in the stands.  I don't  know if it is editing done to prepare the movie for today's market, or it was originally shot this way, but there is not a swastiki or Nazi in the film. The Berlin police are actively involved, but they seem more like police from the 1890s than Hitler's Germany, and there is nothing sinister about them, nor disturbing about Germany. In fact the German police assist Charlie Chan in retrieving this important military device for the USA. Looking at it through the eyes of the next decade of history, and the cliches of the next 50 years of movies, it is a surprisingly innocent film, which makes it an interesting historic document. Surely we see the world in these films as the general pubic would have seen it then, otherwise they would not have accepted the premise of the films: a contemporary detective solves crimes from today's scenes.

I've gotten Vol 1, 2, and 5 of the set and will see what Costco has to offer when next I leave the ranch for the big city. I've seen 6 Chan films so far, and enjoyed them all. Vol 5 is a cheesier production but it contains 7 films on 4 DVDs at the price of the other sets, so no complaints.",1377993600,2,2118,4.392857142857143

It is nice to see Charlie Chan's large family at the Circus and you feel as if you are watching the 1936 Olympics with Lee winning the gold for swimming and meeting little Charlie Chan Jr when you view Charlie Chan at the Olympics.  For Boris Karloff fans, he is amazing in Charlie Chan at the Opera.

2620529,5,B000GY728I,"I remember watching these movies when I was about nine or ten with my cousin.  We both loved the Charlie Chan movies, so whenever they were on we were glued to the old black & white TV.  There were other movies on that we loved, but Charlie Chan was one of our favorites.  The four movies in this set are among the best Charlie Chans that were made, and Warner Oland portrayed the Honolulu detective magnificently.  Even our friends liked these movies and it wasn't unusual to find us playing at being Charlie.  ""Thank you so much"" was almost our by-word, as well as using quasi-Chinese sayings to each other pertinent to whatever mystery we were supposedly solving.
These four movies are among the best of the lot.  ""Charlie Chan at the Opera"" is simply great, because it also has Boris Karloff in it, playing a person who is most definitely not dealing off a full deck.  He portrays a deranged opera singer, but you know that the singing voice is not Karloff's.
""Charlie Chan at the Olympics"" is interesting in that Charlie finds himself between a rock and a hard place.  Does he give the spies the device, or does he sacrifice his #1 son, Lee (Keye Luke).  You can pretty well figure out that it's a bit tricky to trap Charlie Chan, and he proves it very nicely once again.
""Charlie Chan at the Race Track"" is excellent.  Charlie find himself taking on a small group of thugs who are trying to control the race tracks and finagle the horses so they can clean up.  As you might suspect, Charlie steps in and puts the brakes on their little scheme.  Hard!  (But then, isn't he supposed to?)
""Charlie Chan at the Circus"" lets you meet the Chan clan, all fourteen of them, counting Charlie and his lovely wife.  There's the obligatory murders and mystery, as well as some monkey business.  While some people are ""going ape,"" Charlie remains calm, cool, and collected, even when a cobra ""drops in"" on him.  Again, as in all four movies, Keye Luke plays #1 son, Lee Chan.
All in all, this is a fantastic set.  Warner Oland does a truly outstanding job portraying Charlie Chan.  It's a pity he died so young.  I will not disparage Sydney Toler's portrayal in the least, for he was also an excellent Charlie Chan.  Having seen this one and having seen Volume 3, I know that I am going to have to get Volume 1.  I highly recommend this set to anyone who liked these movies.  They're as good to watch today as they were way back when.  ""Do yourself a favor,"" get this set!",1354579200,,2465,4.44097995545657

2620531,5,B000GY728I,"Long unavailable on television, Fox's second Region 1 NTSC boxed set of classic Warner Oland era Charlie Chan movies is another impressive collection drawn from the height of the series popularity, each nicely restored with a complimentary new documentary featurette.

""Sometimes silent witness speak loudest.""

Charlie Chan at the Circus isn't one of the better Warner Oland Chan films, but it's a perfectly serviceable locked room - or more accurately locked circus wagon - mystery that nods to Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue by having an ape the prime suspect. From the days when animals in tiny cages and midgets were regarded as charming amusements - `Midgets! Monkeys! Murder!' promised the trailer - it's probably the old-style circus trappings that would make the politically correct squirm rather than the fact that Chan is played by a Caucasian these days. There are some nice sight gags with the extended Chan clan but the aphorisms are definitely below par on this outing, while Number one son Keye Luke is more interested in tracking down contortionist Su Toy than the murderer this time round. But it's all wrapped up rather satisfactorily as, of course, the most suspicious parties turnout not to be guilty (well, not of murder anyway) and humble Chan's reputation emerges intact.

As with all the titles on this set, the film has a fine restored transfer. Extras are theatrical trailer, documentary featurette Charlie Chan at the Movies and a restoration comparison of all four films.

""Suspicion often father of truth.""

Charlie Chan at the Race Track initially sees Charlie back in Honolulu demonstrating the importance of bloodstains in crime fighting (""Record indicate most murder result from violence, and murder without bloodstain like Amos without Andy - most unusual"" ), but it's not long before the throwing of a race and the murder of the horse's owner sees him travelling to the States to uncover a deadly gambling ring in a case that revolves around - wouldn't you just know it - bloodstains. It's an entertaining entry in the series with a pacey plot involving horse doping, switching horses and deadly photo finishes (the film going to great lengths to showcase the cutting edge technology en route) and allowing Key Luke's Number One son to poke fun at racial stereotypes by adopting exaggerating pidgin English while disguised as a cabin steward - but only when dealing with Caucasians who immediately drop their guard when they hear it. Charlie delivers aphorisms aplenty along the way to the finish line, naturally, but this one's definitely a winner.

Also included is another informative documentary featurette, Number One Son: The Life of Keye Luke.

""This opera is going on tonight even if Frankenstein walks in!""

With he opening credits promising Warner Oland Vs. Boris Karloff, Charlie Chan at the Opera may never quite deliver the promised faceoff, but it's a fine entry in the series that plays to both stars' strengths. Karloff is the unconvincingly dubbed opera singer who recovers his memory after years in the asylum and escapes at the same time as his prima donna ex-wife starts getting threats - charmingly delivered with a bouquet, the card reading `Say it with flowers. You will die tonight.' Naturally it's not long before the opera house becomes a crime scene and when the local police draw a blank, they call on Charlie and his aphorisms to save the day, much to the annoyance of William Demarest's loveable bigot (""Wait a minute, you haven't called Chop Suey in on the case have you, chief?""). Naturally he gets put in his place, his every misplaced insult heralding another overlooked clue uncovered by Charlie inbetween oneliners (""Voice from backseat sometimes very disconcerting to driver"") as he determines to solve the case within the hour so he can catch his boat back to Honolulu in another winning case.

Also included is documentary featurette Charlie Chan's Lucky Director: H. Bruce Humberstone.

""You must think we're all fools!""
""I'm not acquainted with the other gentlemen.""

From a historical perspective, Charlie Chan at the Olympics is one of the most fascinating Chan films more because of what it doesn't show as for what it does. The Maguffin is the theft of a revolutionary remote control device for airplanes stolen by foreign spies who don't mind leaving a trail of dead bodies in their wake, the trail eventually leading to the Olympics. But these aren't just any Olympics - these are Hitler's Olympics, though you'd never know it from looking at the film. Not a single swastika or brown shirt is in sight, let alone der Fuhrer, and while archive footage of Jesse Owens does briefly feature, it's not his solo wins in the 100 or 200 meters, but as part of the winning 4x100 metre relay team. And while Chan does work with the Berlin police (""Things like zis cannot happin in Berlin!""), they're a very Ruritanian bunch with only a bit of stereotyped Prussian pomposity to mark them out as German. Though the film does briefly acknowledge that the sporting conflict is just a prelude to a greater one, the film avoids making its spies Nazis, offering instead international criminals for whom the Olympics simply offer a convenient gathering of foreign powers to bid for their ill-gotten gains.

If it's going out of its way to be apolitical (though still was pulled from distribution once Hitler started stretching his legs in Europe), it's an entertaining yarn, with Chan and both his Number One and Number Two sons (Keye Luke and Layne Tom) helping/hindering him at different stages of the case, and C. Henry Gordon makes for a genuinely an intriguing arms dealer who might save your life one moment and threaten it the next as the situation demands. There's also that emphasis on hi-tech hardware that the mid-Thirties Fox Chan films were so fond of, and Chan's means of beating the shipbound suspects to Berlin - the Hindenberg, with its swastikas airbrushed out - is at once the cutting edge of then modern technology and now a curiously resonant omen of impending doom. And, of course, there are the aphorisms (""Truth like football - receive many kicks before reaching goal"") and amusing dialogue (""Zaraka? You've never met him!"" ""I have never met Santa Claus either but accept gift from him all the same"").

2620536,4,B000GY728I,"'Charlie Chan at the Circus' (1936) - Lee Chan can't seem to keep his mind on the murder investigation.  The beautiful and sexy Su Toy, the circus's 'Human Knot', is quiet a distraction.  Unfortunately, the one time he kept his mind on the investigation, he forgot he had left her locked up in the tiger cage.  Needless to say, she wasn't too happy with Lee ...

'... at the Race Track' (1936) - A man is apparently kicked to death by a horse on a steam ship.  Before joining the cruise, Charlie tells Lee to stay home.  After leaving port, he finds Lee in his cabin.  Lee says he'd never forgive himself if something happened to his pop.  Touched, Charlie says, ""Confucius say: No man is poor, who has worthy son.""

'... at the Opera' (1936) - Charlie finds Lee buying flowers for Miss Lotus, but he is short.  Lee asks Charlie for an advance and begins to describe her.  Charlie politely interrupts, ""She is graceful as a bamboo shoot, beautiful as blossom of water lilly.""  Surprised, Lee asks when he met her.  ""Never ... a long time ago, used the same description for honorable mother.""

'... at the Olympics' (1937) - Lee never misses an opportunity to practice his detective skills.  When Betty thinks Yvonne is trying to steal her beau, Lee eagerly volunteers to checkout the adventuress.  Later, Charlie boards their ship to conduct his own investigation.  As Charlie examines Yvonne's cabin, Lee pops in, feet first, through a porthole.  Lee is quiet pleased that Charlie is there to help him out!

2620538,5,B000GY728I,"Charlie Chan's long reign at the box office really began in 1931, two years after Fox bought the rights and cast Swedish born Warner Oland in the role. Adaptations of Earl Derr Biggers' fine mysteries had proved disappointing on the silent screen, but Oland's casting and Fox's production values, coupled with sound, scored big with audiences. This set contains some of the very best of Oland's films as our favorite sleuth from Hawaii. Keye Luke was a fixture by this point and has a lot to do in these entries.

CHARLIE CHAN AT THE RACE TRACK

Charlie Chan at the Racetrack is one of the most exciting in this great series based on Earl Derr Biggers' Honolulu based sleuth. Warner Oland seemed to enjoy the lightning pace set by director H. Bruce Humberstone in this entry, as he and Keye Luke are obviously having a good time. Charlie actually slugs a guy in this one, vowing to apologise after same awakes from sleep! And Lee sets off a truck filled with fireworks while Charlie rectifies a wrong.

Charlie is revealing how to read blood spatter to other members of law enforcement when son Lee (Keye Luke) bursts in with a hot tip regarding a horse running in The Melbourne Cup in Australia. Even Charlie places a bet because he knows the owner. A jockey paid to throw the race lightens Lee's pockets, however, and soon leads to murder. Charlie hops onboard a Matson oceanliner and heads for the next race with a ship full of suspects and Lee, who has finagled a job onboard. Moving at a nice clip, a lot happens on the way to Santa Juanita, and even more once they arrive.

Charlie takes one in the leg onboard, and has Lee thrown in the brig to protect his foolish son! Keye Luke has a lot to do in this one, however, and the screenplay by Robert Ellis, Helen Logan, and Edward T. Lowe keeps us guessing till the end. Switched horses, a monkey, and a stylish 1930's look fashion this entry into a real winner. A nice little romance between Alice (Helen Wood) and Bruce (Thomas Beck) augment a tight and fast moving Charlie Chan fun for classic movie fans. Chan fans will be delighted with this one.

CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OLYMPICS

Charlie Chan attends the Berlin Olympics and keeps a device allowing planes to fly unmanned out of the hands of spies in this fun entry. Robert Ellis and Helen Logan teamed up again to adapt Paul Burger's story for H. Bruce Humberstone with stellar results. Keye Luke was a fixture at this juncture opposite Warner Oland as Earl Derr Biggers' famous sleuth. In this entry we are introduced to Lee's younger sibling, Chan Jr. (Layne Tom Jr.), who has unfortunately for Charlie, picked up many bad habits from his big brother!

When a plane equipped with a new device for automated operation is stolen, Charlie and his boy discover it abandoned on the beach while on a fishing trip. The new device is missing and the pilot disposed of in the ocean. Soon it becomes apparent that many people were after it including a girl named Yvonne (Katherine DeMille) wearing a white fur. She's Chan Jr's. favorite suspect, but before long Charlie sheds the tiny detective with big ideas to catch up with the steamship, Manhattan, bound for Berlin. That's where the suspects are, including the girl in white fur.

Lee is onboard as part of the swimming team, helping his friend Betty in the romance department but finding time to help with the mystery too. Getting the device back is only part of the story, as Lee is then nabbed and offered to Charlie in a swap. A worried Charlie may prove even more dangerous to the criminals, however, as he sifts through clues and sets a dangerous trap. Coded messages, a lip reader, and the famous Olympics all play a part in making this a fine entry in the series. The sets are nicely done in this one, from Honolulu to Berlin, giving it an enjoyable atmosphere.

You can't miss Lee winning the gold, or Charlie's backup plan to aid him! Great fun for Charlie Chan fans.

CHARLIE CHAN AT THE CIRCUS

Charlie takes his wife and always increasing brood to the circus for one of the most fun entries in the Charlie Chan franchise. A bit more amusement and humor has slipped in to the screen version of Earl Derr Biggers' famous sleuth at this point, with Warner Oland retaining the elegance of Chan while loosening up a bit, showing amusement in dealing with his most enthusiastic supporter, son Lee Chan (Keye Luke). We get to see all Charlie's offspring in this one, as well as his often mentioned wife, portrayed by Annie Mar.

Charlie rarely had a setting this fun, and director Harry Lachman takes full advantage of it, creating a fun atmosphere in which our favorite detective from Hawaii can solve the good mystery concocted by screenwriters Robert Ellis and Helen Logan. Charlie brings the wife and kids to the Kinney and Gaines Circus with free tickets. Soon, one of the disliked partners is found dead, murdered by an ape someone had intentionally let loose. Son Lee keeps busy chasing pretty contortionist Su Toy (Shia Jung) while helping Pop and studying methods of the police. George and Olive Brasno are nice as the circus couple who convince Charlie to stick around with the circus till the next town and investigate.

Things heat up when Nellie Farrell (Drue Layton) makes claim to half the circus by virtue of being the murdered man's wife. Marie Norman (Maxine Reiner), who loved him, isn't convinced, nor is her sweet sister Louise, whose boyfriend is one of the many suspects. Marie's knowledge leads to near tragedy and Chan sets a trap for the killer before anyone else can be harmed. An old news clipping regarding a shooting in El Paso, Texas, will prove the key to solving the case, but not before the ape is on the loose again, and Su catches Lee in drag, with little George disguised as his baby!

Fun, mystery, romance, and Charlie's many children make this entry one of the best. Real circus performers blend seamlessly with a seasoned cast, and this one will become a favorite once you see it.

CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA

Charlie Chan vs. Boris Karloff is how this one is billed in the opening credits, but it is actually a tight little mystery with an opera setting that most Chan fans consider one of the best in the franchise. H. Bruce Humberstone returned as director while Scott Darling and Charles S. Belden adapted Fox's followup to Charlie Chan at the Race Track from a Bess Meredyth story. Thomas Beck made his final appearance in a Chan film here, having had parts in three of the Warner Oland films at Fox. He would be among the cast in two Mr. Moto entries as well. Those who remember William Demarest from My Three Sons on television will have a good time watching him here as a none too bright copper who can't keep up with the sharp mind of our most honorable Chinese detective from Hawaii.

A dark and rainy night at Rockland Sanitarium finds Boris Karloff playing the piano as he has every night for the past seven years. He has been unable to remember his name or past and is believed mad. Upon seeing a newspaper with a picture of Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving) this stormy night, however, he remembers being Gravelle, a great opera singer who supposedly burned up in a fire. He also remembers it was no accident, and the manhunt begins. Charlie is asked to assist in the hunt by the police, and son Lee (Keye Luke) forgets his romantic plans to help pop. As usual, Lee's help provides some humor, but also some clues. Lee dresses as a knight with his college pals and prowls the dark passageways beneath the opera house for clues at one point.

Gravelle wants revenge and soon the two leads are murdered, while the manhunt continues. Chan discovers marital jealousy present at the opera also, however, which points to other possible motives, and suspects other than Gravelle. Kitty (Charlotte Henry) and Phil (Thomas Beck) are a nice young couple seeking to meet with Rochelle on opening night and she proves to have a connection with the madman. Karloff is quite good here, never seeming over the top. A good cast and fun setting for Oland and Luke make this one a topflight entry in the Charlie Chan series.

This is a marvelous boxed set for Charlie Chan fans, and perhaps my favorite set overall from the Oland era.

2620554,4,B000GY728I,"Great Atmosphere, Lots of Mystery, and Intriguing Detection

Charlie Chan at the Circus is one of my favorite Charlie Chan movies. Even though I remembered the story very well (which I hadn't seen in at least 40 years), I found myself admiring the mystery and the plotting. The acting is even more entertaining than I remembered.

You have a real treat ahead of you if you haven't seen this movie before (or saw it so long ago that you cannot remember much about it).

As the film opens, Charlie Chan is present with his wife and 12 children enjoying the side show at a circus. The children are lined up in reverse height which is a good play on the photographs of Charlie's family in earlier movies in the series. They are on vacation. The ticket taker is thrilled by the chance to collect $3.50 for such a large family, but he's disappointed when Charlie offers a free pass instead in his hat band.

One of the circus's owners, Joe Kinney, read that Charlie is in town and wants to consult Charlie about some threatening letters he's been receiving. They agree to meet at 9 p.m. in the business office. When Charlie arrives there's no one there, but there is a light inside. Upon closer inspection, it turns out that the co-owner has been strangled and his neck broken. But how? The office was locked and bolted on the inside.

With that locked room mystery to whet his appetite, Charlie reluctantly plans to continue on to the Grand Canyon with his family until one of the circus performers pleads for him to help so that the circus people won't lose their jobs. With the encouragement of his children and agreement of his wife, Charlie and number one son, Lee, join the investigation.

Soon, there are enough motives to lead to a dozen killings. No one liked Kinney, who was brutal to both people and animals. The only person who liked him was a woman who stands to collect on a $50,000 insurance policy.

But death's threats aren't limited to Kinney. The killer seems determined to take out Charlie and anyone else who can provide a threat.

This is an old-fashioned circus which travels by train. Many of the scenes are set on the train or during performances. You get an authentic feel for the old big top days by small circuses. An elephant pushes another animal's cage. A hippopotamus is fed with a shovel. There are some excellent high-wire acts. I could practically smell the sawdust.

Like all early Charlie Chan films, this one features some excellent dancing. The dancers will surprise you: They are midgets (George and Olive Brasno) doing the tango.

There's lots of humor as Lee falls for the Chinese contortionist and later dresses up as a mother pushing a child in a pram to track one of the suspects.

The story moves fast and contains some excellent photography to match the acting. In this restored version, the film probably looks almost as good as it did when it was first released.

Intriguing International Suspense Film Filled with Memorable Scenes of a Past Age

In Charlie Chan at the Olympics you see the future of modern warfare as it is fought in the 21st century through planes piloted by remote control while also getting a look at aviation's dated past in the form of the dirigible Hindenburg soon before it came to a flaming end. Just those two aspects of the movie would be enough to keep many musing for months.

There's also a story of international espionage. During a test of the new remote navigation system in Hawaii, the test plane is hijacked and the key technology is stolen. As those with an interest in the technology quickly leave town, Charlie Chan is dispatched to find and recover the device. By employing the Pan Am clipper to Oakland and then the cross-country nonstop plane to the East, Charlie is able to snag a ride on the Hindenburg and arrive in Germany before the ship containing the suspects does.

Once in Berlin, the device plays hide-and-seek with those who want it so much that you never seem to know where it is. The danger rises when the spies kidnap Lee Chan (Keye Luke) and hold him in hopes of gaining the device. Charlie is clearly sweating bullets at that point but draws on another advanced technology to save the day.

In the background is the story of the Olympics that were held in Berlin in 1936. The American team cheers for Jesse Owens and you see the opening ceremonies. Lee is on the American team and hopes to earn a gold medal in swimming. One of the suspects is also on team as a pole vaulter. You'll be astonished at how the techniques, equipment, and clothing have changed for athletes since 1936. The athletic performances also aren't too impressive, more like what a high school kid would do today.

The movie is filled with much good humor as Charlie interacts with his two sons, Lee and Charlie Chan, Jr. Both want to exercise their investigative powers while Junior also wants to learn fishing. It seems like they both need a detective to find fish. That rare instance of less than perfect performance makes Charlie all the more appealing.

Rich in Acting, Weak on Mystery

In Charlie Chan at the Opera, you'll see a combination of Phantom of the Opera and the Hunchback of Notre Dame displayed as a Charlie Chan mystery steeped in fine acting and good atmosphere. As the movie opens, an unidentified amnesia patient (Boris Karloff) is compulsively playing the piano while singing opera at a sanitarium. An attendant annoys him by interrupting, but offers the evening newspaper as solace. The photograph of an opera singer, Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving), enrages the patient who knocks the attendant out and takes off wearing the attendant's uniform.

Later, Charlie Chan stops by to say good-bye to Inspector Regan before leaving on the night boat to Honolulu. While there, Charlie ruffles Sergeant Kelly's feathers with deductions about the problems the police are having in finding the amnesia patient. They are interrupted by Lilli Rochelle who drops in to report a death threat tied to that night's performance. Charlie and the police agree to attend that performance to keep her safe.

At the opera, it becomes clear that Lilli has been seeing her baritone, Enrico Barelli, much to the annoyance of Madame Barelli and Lilli's husband, Mr. Whitely. All of that turmoil is interrupted when the amnesia patient shows up in Madame Barelli's dressing room, and she identifies him as Gravelle, a baritone who had ""died"" in an opera house fire. Gravelle claims that someone locked in his dressing room, but he escaped anyway and is just recovering his memory.

As the plot goes on, dead bodies begin to pile up and the police are at a loss to track down the unauthorized people who are wandering through the opera house.

A lot of the appeal of this film comes from the fine acting performances by Boris Karloff and Warner Oland who are supported well with some very funny scenes and gags by William Demarest as Sergeant Kelly and Keye Luke as Charlie's oldest son. Charlie also shows himself to be advanced scientifically as he brings up finger prints with acid and arranges for a newspaper to send a photograph by the equivalent of a fax in the 1930s.

The film is fast moving. It has to be. Charlie wants to make that night boat back to Honolulu so he can see the rest of his family again.

The ""Chinese"" sayings of Charlie Chan also provide lots of humor. Here is my favorite from the film: ""Luck -- happy combination of small accidents"" which is offered by Charlie as a face-saving explanation why Sergeant Kelly wasn't able to figure out what was going on.

Little Mystery in This Investigation, But Lots of Poor Cultural Stereotypes

Most of the Charlie Chan films are notable for the dignity and respect that are shown to the Chinese-American ancestry of Charlie Chan. Only the missing articles in front of nouns, missing verbs, and tense slips mark the fictional Charlie as someone who isn't a native speaker of English. The accent is itself is not noticeably Chinese. Although Warner Oland was not of Chinese ancestry, his appearance is sufficiently oriental not to seem like ""black face"" makeup.

Those circumstances change, however, for the worse in Charlie Chan at the Race Track. Charlie doesn't change, but his son Lee (played by Keye Luke, who is a Chinese-American in reality) plays negative stereotype ""just off the boat"" roles (including Pidgin English) in undercover assignments for Charlie in this film. The story didn't need him to do this, so I felt it was gratuitous stereotyping.

That perception is reinforced by one of the most servile, cringing African-American stereotype Stepin-Fetchit roles I've ever seen by John H. Allen playing ""Streamline"" Jones. I felt disgusted to see this exploitation of an actor into reinforcing racial prejudices about laziness, drinking too much, and being a coward.

The story itself isn't much. A great race horse, Avalanche, has been born, bred, and trained in Australia. An American buys Avalanche to bring him to the U.S. to race at Santa Juanita (think Santa Anita).  An international gang of crooked gamblers is involved in sabotaging Avalanche so that they can collect on long shots.

Aboard a ship going to Honolulu, the horse's trainer is killed and mysterious notes float around making threats. It's obvious that Avalanche is switched with another horse, and Charlie sets out to reverse the switch while staying out of the gang's deadly clutches.

If you pay attention to the clues, you won't have any trouble identifying the murderer.  The rest is mostly Keystone Kops imitations involving Lee Chan.

As usual, the best parts of the movie come in Charlie's aphorisms: ""Record indicate most murder result from violence, and murder without bloodstain like Amos without Andy -- most unusual.""  That little ditty leads into a lesson in how to interpret blood stains which turns out to be relevant to solving this mystery.

Unless you feel compelled to watch all the old Charlie Chan movies featuring Warner Oland, you can skip this one.",1203552000,,9995,4.783391405342625
2620555,5,B000GY728I,"Warner Oland, though Swedish, played Chinese Detective Charlie Chan to perfection. As with the other volumes in this collection, these films are fun to watch over and over again.

2620556,4,B000GY728I,"After watching these movies,you will be coming up with alot of Chan aphorisms like that one...but probably much,much better!
This box set includes:
CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA,CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OLYMPICS,CHARLIE CHAN AT THE RACE TRACK and CHARLIE CHAN AT THE CIRCUS.
I haven't seen any of these films in at least 50 years but they have lost none of their charm and heart and that is in BIG part to Warner Oland himself. I have seen Oland,Toler and Winters each playing the famous detective. In my oppinion the latter two just tried hard to imitate Oland but fell far short of the mark. They didn't have the dignity,heart,warmth nor comportment the way Oland did. In fact I have seen very few actors immerse themselves in their characters as much as he did. I would even dare say that after a time the two almost became inseperable. I know relatively little of Warner Oland's career except that I know he had played Oriental parts in previous years and that there was at one stage a walk off of a film set by the actor and then his eventual return to Sweden. He was having personal problems,alot of it brought on by alcohol. By today's standards one might say he was burned out. In the end he never returned and died in his homeland. Tragic,for his family and the public,as we lost a very talented man that day in 1938.
I recall reading but never finishing a Derr Biggers Charlie Chan novel. The reason? I had watched a couple of Oland Chan's before hand. Big mistake. I found the character in the books to be different than the on screen character fleshed out with such panache by Oland. It is one of the few times I have committed the literary sin of preferring the movie over the book. That is the impact Oland had on me and that impact has only been heightened considerably with the release of this and the other Oland Chan
films by Fox.
Each film has been transferred over to DVD using the best available source material on hand at Fox. There is a definite difference in the quality from one film to the next but the age of one particular film compared to another matters little. As I said it's the quality of the material on hand which makes it or breaks it. Some are very clean and crisp while others are quite grainy. However ALL are visually quite clear.
Fox seems to have done the best they can with what they have. When one considers that four versions are seemingly lost we should be thankful to at least have these films.
Finally all these sets come with many featurettes that are sure to delight even the most casual Chan fan. As is my practice I have not seen them yet but I am looking forward to viewing them all at a later time.
In conclusion I highly recommmend these Warner Oland Charlie Chan box sets to one and all. It is a must have for all Charlie Chan fans and for those who have never seen them I will tell you that you are in for a special treat. And for those curious enough to want to see the later Chan actors to compare I would advise you to rent if you can. If not possible just buy one or two and see how you like them. But I think it will become apparent very quickly that THESE Chans with the magnificent and talented Warner Oland will become,like me,your favourites too!",1201478400,3,3203,4.366834170854271

Even though we all know that he was an alcoholic, his exquisite acting was the best for this role!  What people don't know is that he was a superb actor from the start.  Charlie Chan just made him even more famous.  His acting in the Jazz Singer was well done also.  His facial expressions in the silent movies carried over to his talkies.  Simply put Warner Oland is the best Charlie Chan around period.",1200096000,,516,4.425531914893617
2620558,5,B000GY728I,"If you are unfamiliar with the Charlie Chan series, I would suggest you start here. If you don't like these four films this series is not for you, since I consider these to be the best of the boxed sets of Chan films put out so far. All four movies feature Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and also have Keye Luke as Chan's son, Lee Chan. When these two were teamed the best films of the series resulted. Oland presents Chan as the extremely able yet humble detective and family man, and Keye Luke as Lee Chan provides the series with youth and athleticism, even if young Lee Chan does get ahead of himself sometimes, injecting some very humorous moments in the films.

""Charlie Chan at the Circus"" has Charlie taking his very large family on vacation. He visits the circus since the owner has provided his family with free tickets. However, the very unlikeable owner is murdered during the performance and Charlie - with the blessing of his family - cuts his vacation short to solve the crime. Extra features include:
The original theatrical trailer
The restoration featurette (included on all four discs)
CHARLIE CHAN AT THE MOVIES featurette - discusses the four films in this set, their productions, and a little about the cast and crew.

""Charlie Chan at the Opera"" is somewhat misleadingly billed as ""Charlie Chan versus Boris Karloff"". Karloff does feature prominently in the film. However, he plays a sympathetic character who has escaped from a mental institution and walks a line between genius and madness who may or may not have committed the featured crimes in this film. Look for William Demarest who plays a cop who is not too pleased with Chan's involvement in the investigation. Extra features include:
CHARLIE CHAN'S LUCKY DIRECTOR: H. BRUCE HUMBERSTONE featurette - discusses the diverse directing career of Humberstone.

""Charlie Chan at the Olympics"" has Charlie investigating a murder and the theft of a device that could be used by foreign powers. Clues lead him to Berlin, the site of the 1936 Olympics. Once in Berlin he and his son Lee, a member of the American Olympic swim team, are reunited to solve the crime. Strangely enough, no direct mention of what is going on in Germany at the time is a direct issue in this film. However, there are some indirect swipes made at the regime, and this is discussed in the featurette that comes with this film. Extra features include:
LAYNE TOM JR.: THE ADVENTURES OF CHARLIE CHAN JR. featurette - about the actor who played three of the Chan sons in three different films and his stories about life as an actor.

""Charlie Chan at the Race Track"" has Chan investigating a murder of the owner of a prize winning race horse on board a ship that is traveling from Hawaii to Los Angeles. This film has some early mention of forensics, first as Chan is explaining the use of blood spatter patterns to determine the weapon and the position of the killer and victim to a young group of detectives, and later as Chan is using these same patterns to determine how the shipboard murder took place. Extra features include:
NUMBER ONE SON: THE LIFE OF KEYE LUKE featurette - talks about Keye Luke's life as an artist and an actor.

If you like this set I advise you to check out volumes one and three of the Charlie Chan series also, since these two volumes also feature Warner Oland as Chan.",1200096000,,3343,4.66893039049236

2620568,5,B000GY728I,"Both sets have been reviewed many times so I am making mine short and to the point. Vol. I and II are both thematic (I. deals with places--famous world cities) and II (the best) involves events. The best two entries are ""At the Circus"" that shows Chan for the first time with his large family of 12 (it grew to 14 later on in the series) and deals with the murder of the very unpopular circus owner. ""CC At The Olympics"" is an amazing piece of work. #1 son (the great Keye Luke) is a contender at the Nazi occupied Berlin Olympics. This premise on it's own (even with it's great subplot) makes this one of best in the Oland series.

None of the Chan Francishe films ran more than an hour (70 minutes top), so both sets containing 4 discs are quite expensive (although Fox is reputed to have spent $2,000,000 in restoration). To round out the set is the Sidney Toler WWII outings released by MGM--CHANTOLOGY (which is far to cautious due to the times--and the series had moved to B studio Monogram).

If you are a REAL fan, then all three pricey sets are worth the investment. I have tried to buy them used at a lesser price. BEWARE! Once you start watching the series (and unfortunately many of the finer outings have lost their copyright and only available on poorly made homemade bootleg DVD-Rs), you will get hooked on the most famous Oriental detective (based on a real life Honolulu detective) of all time, the amazing Charlie Chan.

Also, there are specials on the discs such as the story of Keye Luke as told by family and friends. It was a great addition, and I knew little of ""Master Po"", but it was a very interesting life he led>",1170288000,6,443,4.091954022988506
2620578,4,B000GY728I,"I have loved Charlie Chan movies since they appeared on TV in the 60's.  They have great atmosphere,and lighting.  The indoor lighting is almost always waist level, giving a shadowy caste.  The character actors are first rate and Warner Oland was the best, although there were certainly some ones with Sidney Toler.  ""Castle in the Desert"" is certainly one. Recently a cable station would only show these movies preceded by a panel discussing the movies portrayal of asians.  Certainly Charlie's accent was unnecessary since he was born in Hawaii. And an asian actor was never used.  However Charlie was an extremely clever detective, perhaps a model detective and extremely respected throughout the world. And a great father. Watching these movies relaxes me and makes me nostalgic for the 30's although I didn't live then. It's too bad some of the early ones with Warner Oland were lost.",1170201600,6,889,5.01360544217687

2620580,5,B000GY728I,"Many critics feel the Charlie Chan films did not truly hit their stride until 1936 and 1937, when the release of four particularly lively titles set a new standard for the series.  THE CHARLIE CHAN COLLECTION, VOL. 2 not only presents those four films, it restores them as well; after years of neglect, Warner Oland, Keye Luke, and company look better than ever.

Charlie was original created by novelist Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933), who very loosely based the character on Hawaii's legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933.)  Biggers wrote six novels in all, and after several false starts 20th Century Fox (then simply known as Fox) hit on the right combination of actors, mystery, and comedy, and the result was perhaps the single most popular film series Hollywood ever created.  Although contemporary audiences tend to view the films as politically incorrect, the fact remains that Chan and his family--most often personified by Keye Luke as son Jimmy--were among the very few positive Asian characters on American movie screens at the time; as such they were particularly popular with Asian-American audiences of the day.

The four Chan films in this collection are actually the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th releases in the series, all starring Warner Oland as Chan, all featuring Keye Luke as son Jimmy Chan, and all but one directed by the capable and exacting H. Bruce Humberstone.  The most celebrated title is CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA, which co-stars Oland with Boris Karloff in what many consider to be the single finest film in the series.  Featuring an operatic score written by Oscar Levant, the story finds Chan called upon to protect diva Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving), who has received a death threat.  It soon transpires, however, that Madame Rochelle is no blushing innocent: she has a past that includes ""an escaped maniac"" in the form of Boris Karloff, and no sooner does the overture begin than murder is afoot.  The film is unexpectedly stylish; the noteworthy cast includes William Demarest and Nedda Harrigan; and the script very distinctly works to undercut racist notions of the day, with Demarest at first offensively derrisive but ultimately impressed with Chan's skill.

Although not as highly budgeted as OPERA, AT THE RACE TRACK and AT THE OLYMPICS also bear Humberstone's distinct touch.  RACE TRACK finds Chan matching wits with a gambling ring determined to turn otherwise honest horse races to their advantage.  John Henry Allen's portrayal of ""Streamline,"" a Stepin Fetchit-like character, is perhaps most charitably viewed as a measure of how far African-American actors have come since the 1930s; this aside, however, the cast is solid and the story entertaining.  AT THE OLYMPICS is remarkably disconcerting from a historic point of view.  Opening in Hawaii and making references to Pearl Harbor, the film concerns the theft of an aircraft device which has military application.  Chan is soon on his way to Berlin via The Hindenberg, no less, and finds himself confronting a host of spies and counterspies at the 1936 Olympics.  Interestingly, the film makers work hard to avoid mention of the Nazis; although stock footage abounds--including footage of Jessie Owens--the inevitable swatiskas are kept out of focus or more obviously simply blotted out.

While the three Humberstone films in this set tend to receive the bulk of critical favor, my own favorite in this collection is CHARLIE CHAN AT THE CIRCUS.  Directed by Harry Lachman, who would go on to direct other Chan films somewhat later, the film is long on charm in its tale of murder under the big top, complete with sultry trapeze artists (Maxine Reiner), dancing little people (George and Olive Brasno), slinky contortionists (Shai Jung), and even one of those bad 1930s ape costumes.  Chan films seldom trouble themselves too much with plot detail, and AT THE CIRCUS is a particularly flyweight entry; even so, it is tremendously amusing, unexpectedly atmospheric, and George and Olive Brasno are standouts among the supporting cast.

The remasters are not flawless, but they are very good indeed.  I must, however, sound a slightly sour note re the bonus features, which are interesting in themselves but which slight in comparison with what might have been done if the studio had really put its heart into it.  Still, the Keye Luke biography is particularly welcome (moderns tend to overlook the truly groundbreaking nature of his career) and the ""Charlie Chan at the Movies"" featurette is quite nice.  Overall, I strongly recommend this collection to Chan fans everywhere.
