6925277,5,B00R9SRADQ,"This workout DVD is very fun. The combination of dance, flexibility, and strength makes it's challenging. The Dvd is not extremely difficult that you feel defeated. The instructor is fun, uplifting, but not annoying. You can chose to do the workout with music or without. The music is instrumental, not annoying at all. Hope this helps someone. I think it's great to have in your workout collection.",1422835200,3,399,4.970149253731344

6925280,4,B00R9SRADQ,"I just got done doing this workout for the first time, and really liked it.  This is the first time I've done one of Anna Kaiser's workouts, but was interested in trying it out since she currently trains Kelly Ripa and Sarah Jessica Parker, both of whom are in amazing shape.  It's a long workout (it clocks in at 84 minutes long total), but it moves quickly and I was sitting in a pool of sweat by the end!  

To do the workout, you'll need the following equipment:

* a mat
* a pair of dumbbells (3', 5's, or 8's are recommended)

You'll also want some supportive shoes and a high-impact sports bra.

The main menu includes the following options:

*  Introduction with Sarah Jessica Parker - a three-minute video where Anna explains how to use the workout; it also includes a fun clip of the set-up for the workout, and some small clips of SJP talking to Anna about the philosophy behind Anna's workouts
*  Q&A with Anna - just over seven minutes long; this is a video where Anna is ""talking"" (it's kind of awkwardly staged) with a group of people, who ask her questions about her workouts; the first question is ""How do I get Kelly Ripa's abs?""
*  Happy Hour Workout
*  Happy Hour Workout with No Music
*  Treadmill Workout -- not a complete workout, but rather a five-minute sample of what her treadmill workouts are like

The workout opens with a twelve-minute warm-up and ends with a twelve-minute cooldown. The main part of the workout is just about sixty minutes long, and it's broken up between strength and dance-cardio intervals.  The strength moves also have a nice mix of flexibility moves mixed in.

Since I sometimes seem to have two left feet, I was worried if I'd be able to follow along alright with the dance segments, but Anna is a great cuer in the dance segments, and so I had no problems keeping up.  After learning each segment, you also put the moves all together in a sequence. I know some people don't like it when workouts do the ""take it from the top"" (or ""TIFTF'ing""), but because it's just for smaller segments, it didn't feel overly repetitious to me -- although the first dance segment did feel a bit boring after we repeated it a few too many times. The dance segments are considered interval-based since Anna will take short breaks during them to stretch you out and lower your heart rate, before jumping back into repeating the dance again. It's been awhile since I've done Tracy Anderson's dance cardio, but Anna's style feels more athletic than Tracy's.

I also love that Anna mirror cues, which always makes it easier to keep up.  Where the cueing could be better is in the strength segments; I often had a hard time figuring out what she was doing when you're not in a position to look at the screen, and had to keep looking up a lot to figure out what we were supposed to be doing.

Each time the workout moves to a new segment (there are ten segments total), the screen greys out, and there is a countdown clock letting you know what's coming up next (i.e., cardio) and encouraging you to take a water break.  I did have to pause a few times since I needed a bit more time to grab some water and get my mat and weights out of the way in time for the next segment.

The music is non-vocal electronica, and was nicely synced with the workouts.  I felt like it had great energy and really added to the workout.  Having the option of doing the non-music workout is great, too, though, if you want to play your own music.

The female background exerciser is a modifier, and she shows great low-impact modifications for each move.  The male exerciser shows more higher-impact moves.  Anna is in phenomenal shape, and is very motivating.

As far as the difficulty level goes, I would say that this is a high-intermediate or advanced workout. During the last cardio segment, I had to take things down a notch since I was feeling pretty tired.

I had been wondering how often you could do this workout, and, at the very end of the workout, Anna mentions that she and the background exercisers do this workout every day.  In other words, it's OK to do this a few times a week or even on back-to-back days without, according to Anna, run the risk of overtraining.

As much as I enjoyed this workout, there are a few reasons why I didn't give this a five-star review:

1.  It's so long that I'm not sure how or how often I will use this.  I knew it was this long before I bought it so I have to take some of the resposibility, but I wish it had included a shorter premix (like maybe 45- or 50-minute long) or at least some suggestions on how to make it shorter.

2.  As mentioned above, some of the dance segments felt repetitious to me -- and I was already feeling bored in a few of them after just doing this workout once since the moves don't have a lot of complexity in terms of the choreography.  I also felt like some segments were uneven; in the last new combo you learn, for instance, you do the whole thing on the right for an entire segment, and only lead with the left the next time around for a few times.

3.  I like Anna's hyper, energetic personality a lot and her enthusiasm helped me get through this long workout, but in places there was a bit too much shrieking.

4.  I'm not sure how I'll use this workout.  Since it focuses on functional training, I feel like I would need to add in more workouts that focus on strength moves.

Overall, though, I have about 300 workouts in my collection, and this one is pretty unique!  I'm really glad I decided to try it, and hope that Anna puts out more DVDs in the future!

UPDATE ON 1-30-15:  Anna just did a short Q&A video on YouTube, where she answered questions about this new DVD.  In that video, she recommends starting by doing this three times a week if you're a beginner, and working up from there.

As far as how to break it into shorter workouts, she said you can divide it up several ways:

--do warm-up, plyos, cardio, and upper body as a workout

--do cardio and lower body as a second section

--do cardio, abs, and cooldown as a third option

--do warm-up, fast forward to strength sections or cardio sections, go to cooldown

If you mix it up in this way, Anna said to change it up so that you hit all the segments over the course of the week, and to also try to fit in the entire workout in its entirety once.

Hope that helps!",1422057600,,6335,4.359215017064846

6925284,5,B00R9SRADQ,"I avoided trying her dvd for over a month because I was afraid of how torturous it would be.  I normally do Zumba and I add a 10 minute Anna Kaiser booty workout video on YouTube which totals about an hour.  Anyway, learning the dance moves on the DVD were way easier than learning dance moves to Zumba. Although, I feel like dancing to Zumba can be more fun.  I gather Anna Kaiser's workout will give you better results than Zumba because she incorporates muscle building moves in the workout.  I actually feel like I worked out my muscles as opposed to only feeling exhausted from cardio.  The last thing I want to be is a ""skinny fat person."" (Google if you don't know what that is) My only complaint is that it's too long!  And she keeps making it seem like you're all finished, but then goes on to something else, haha!",1445212800,,824,4.352941176470588
6925285,4,B00R9SRADQ,"I like this dvd so far but I don't love it.  I've done it twice and made it through the second cardio workout because of time issues.  I'm not a novice to cardio dance workouts so I know that isn't the issue.  I have all of the Zumba dvds and really like them.  I think one of the challenges of this dvd  is that as other reviewers have said, you do need a lot of room for the cardio dance part.  I have a decent size family room where I am doing this.  However, space is still an issue and I have to switch around so I'm not facing the TV to have enough room without cutting down the size of my steps (in the first cardio, Anna and her crew take pretty large walking and shuffle steps and I keep ending up in my fireplace).  I like that the dvd is in segments so that I can choose which ones i want.  There isn't a menu of sections but my play station control lets me jump sections.  I don't really like the arm section (some of the moves have you in a pike position, you're almost upside-down,  and it makes me sick) so I use my TRX for my arms.  I think so far (and I'm going to keep doing the dvd in my rotation of dvds) is that the music sucks. It's electronic club music (I think) and it's really uninspiring for me to work out to.  Anna and her crew are dancing around and she's yelling have fun, live life but the music is really boring to dance to and I'm not inspired.  I don't find the cardio super difficult (Zumba is much more difficult in terms of steps but has much better music) but I just get bored.  I will keep doing it but I'm going to see if I can use my Ipod music for the dance sections.",1443052800,2,1610,3.9411764705882355
6925286,5,B00R9SRADQ,"I am completely new to home workouts and to working out in general. I am a young, 24 year old student who got out of exercising in PE in elementary school by throwing up. I always felt light headed and nauseated with the thought of exercise. I did take to running, but I hate feeling like a stiff brick so I stop after awhile and start up every now again. Now that the backstory is over, I got to say...I LOVE this DVD. Okay, maybe not love, but it's great. It's definitely a challenge and I love the dance aspects. I think I've only gotten close to the end of the DVD once since I bought it a few months ago. It feels efficient and can be really fun. I still get nauseated from exercise, but I don't always care because I am having a blast pushing myself to this DVD. It took me awhile to not feel like a fool doing all the dance moves, but it feels like it works so I keep trying. The cons is that it does take up a lot of room and because I live in a small apartment I would have to find another place to work out because my roommate is bringing a couch soon. If you've got a self-motivating attitude, this DVD is for you. If you don't like a challenge...well...idk...",1438992000,3,1171,4.073593073593074

6925293,5,B00R9SRADQ,"LOVE this workout! Not only is it intense but your body is 100% worked and you are DRIPPING in sweat! One tiny little thing... The workout is 1 hour and 20 minutes Not 60 minutes. BIG difference when you're a mom trying to squeeze workouts in.

This is a circuit training workout. There's a warm up that is about 10 minutes, a dance cardio circuit that is longer then an arm strength circuit, another dance cardio then a leg circuit, dance cardio then the other leg, dance cardio then abs and a really great cool down and stretch that is about 8 minutes (not 12).

I'm so pleased with this workout and I'm an avid DVD workout girl. Jillian, Insanity, Jackie Warner, Tracy Anderson, Ballet Beautiful, Piloxing and more and this is truly in my top 5. If you are looking to be physically worked and spent, dripping in sweat and completely excited, you will want to try this. The dance steps are easy to catch - the second routine is  a bit more difficult but completely doable. You'll love this, promise!",1433808000,,1001,4.489010989010989
6925294,2,B00R9SRADQ,"The DVD is very unique and I feel like it absolutely does physically challenge people both cardiovascularly and resistance-wise. Anna gives good tips and is very enthusiastic and motivating to follow. In fact, she is so motivating, I did this DVD for the first few times without realizing I had seriously injured sacroiliac ligaments in my lower back-- I thought I'd just strained a muscle in my lower back and kept doing it thinking it wasn't that big a deal. I think it was specifically the lower body resistance moves that injured my back ligaments: in the video, she has you do these twisting, side squat exercises (I did the ones she was modeling given that I'm in pretty good shape as opposed to the one's by her female assistant who does the less challenging ones) and then the gluteus muscle exercises seemed to make it worse as well. Anyway, I went to my doctor after my ""muscle strain"" not healing for 2 weeks, and then discovered I'd actually sprained and re-sprained several sacroiliac ligaments that are supposed to take 6-8 weeks to heal. I ride dressage, road bike, run, and am pretty physically active, so I was devastated to learn that I can't ride horses or bike for this amount of time or longer while the ligaments heal, and that they'll always be prone to re-injury since the scar tissue will be weaker than the original tissue, which can definitely impact my ability to ride uninjured long term.  As someone who loves these types of exercises, it was really depressing to get this news from my PT.  You do take a risk with ANY exercise video because you're not being supervised regarding proper form, and everyone's bodies are different - as I've learned through PT, we all have muscular imbalances, alignment imperfections, and things like muscle tightness that can affect our vulnerability to injury when doing challenging exercises. I think I will stop doing workout DVD's and transition more to doing exercises in classes with supervision to ensure good form. On the other hand, I also have to say that I've done a ton of Jillian Anderson DVD's and I have never gotten seriously injured by any of those DVD's. Anna's exercises are unique and involve twisting with some of them, and for my body, this was just something it couldn't handle without injury, so just be aware if you have lower back issues.",1433289600,10,2327,4.74320987654321

6925297,5,B00R9SRADQ,"Anna Kaiser has done a great job. I own several exercise DVDs and this one is very challenging--well, considering I'm out of shape now. I love the cardio bursts even though I'm cursing her as she leads me through another one. She cues very well and you can tell that she is natural with people and a confident gal. I even don't mind her cheeriness because she's not over the top with it. The assistants are great too. The woman in the back  (Arielle?) is like a Greek chorus whose face displays everything I feel while I work. And Adam rocked the abs section like a beast. Anna has boundless energy it almost seems like she's a robot! I'm not great with the choreography, but I'm not a perfectionist and I look forward to mastering the moves. It keeps me from being bored. Also it is good for your brain to be challenged by choreography.  I wouldn't be discouraged if you don't master the moves right away, just be safe with your body.

Now that I'm on the road promoting my latest book, I take this DVD with me everywhere I go and never miss a beat. AKT InMotion is truly the most innovative, fun, challenging workout on the market today, and this DVD captures the exact same vibe as Anna's super exclusive studio. UPDATE (1/27/16): You can now stream Anna's entire video library of over 1,000 minutes of videos for $50 a month on her website. Less than a gym membership in bigger cities and half the price of Tracy Anderson's streaming service. GREAT DEAL in my book!",1429488000,,670,4.545454545454546

6925300,3,B00R9SRADQ,"I was really excited to try this workout but was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good workout, you will sweat and get a good workout from it.  Here are the problems I had with it:  1.  you better have a lot of room to move around in 2.  it was repetitive and that made it boring - started out good and she mixes in strength in between which did help but then the cardio always goes back to the same thing and by the end I was really burned out on it, probably THE MOST REPETITIVE DVD I own 3.  My pet peeve with workout videos - the whole thing was 84 minutes as it said on the back but it said the cool down was 12 minutes  - it was 6 minutes.  The warmup said 12 minutes and it was 10 minutes. I own many DVD workouts and at least half of them have the incorrect amount of time listed for their workouts and I really hate that.  They just tell you what they think you want to hear so that you will buy it. - Not a big deal but it's annoying because it happens a lot.  Lastly, during the 2nd cardio portion she does the same side the entire time until the very end, when you're burned out on it and then she switches to the other side (turns opposite way and goes down with opposite hand snap move).  It's too late to do the other side now because you are so used to doing it the other way the entire time that it feels awkward now.  It's almost as if she completely forgot to switch over and now your workout is lopsided because most of the cardio was done on one side and she spends only a few minutes doing the other side so you have to remember to just do it yourself.  This is my other pet peeve with workout videos - really? It's the one thing you are doing and you can't get your own freaken workout right? Ridiculous.

Alot of high impact jumps, twists and fast changes of body position which if you are not accustomed could lead to injury such as in my case. On a positive note, loved the music, Anna is super high energy and motivating...just make sure you are conditioned for this type of workout before you dive in.

I know you need the cardio for all over fitness just wish it was less choreographed and more calistentics.

This is her first dvd (that I know of) and Im going to keep it.  Definatley challenging but hope shell come out with a series like Chris Freytag (upper body, lower body, total body, etc.)  That way you can do what you have time for and want to hit the most. I know you cant spot train.  She gives directions on how to do this in the q and a but personally I don't think there are enough reps in the arm series.

It'd be fun to do in a small open gym type area.  Its a good dvd, the parts that I could do.

6925315,4,B00R9SRADQ,"The Cardio:
The cardio in this workout is a mix between hi-low aerobics, dance and kick boxing. If you like dance type cardio you will like this. She does combinations where she builds on the routine. The moves are not overly complicated, but you do need to be semi-coordinated. She does a great job cuing and you will catch on to the moves, as she repeats them multiple times. If you are used to athletic cardio like burpees, jumping jacks and high-knees, this cardio is very different. I felt as if it was more of a steady-state cardio than a true interval.

The Weights:
The weight section was AMAZING! but way too short! I could have done it 3 times in a row. This is a cardo and strength DVD, but the cardio far outweighs the strength. The arms and leg section had really unique moves, I just wish she did more of this.

Timing:
The warmup is 12 min, then there is about 20 min of cardio and then 6 min of arms, then 10 or so more min of cardio, then 8-9 min of legs on one side, then 10-15 min of cardio and then legs on the other side, and then cardio and then core.

NO premixes
one of the main reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that this workout is LONG (I think 80 min or so) without any premixes. I tried skipping sections by hitting 'next' on my remote, and this worked, but this was a major miss. Workout DVDs are  made for people who are busy, and often we need to do 20,30 min at a time. Premixe4s and different workout options are a must!

Anna is a great instructor and very energetic. If you prefer dancy cardio or like zumba, kickboxing or high-low aerobics, I think you will like the cardio. If you are used to more Athletic cardio from instructors like  Jillian, Amy Dixon, Insanity or any of those types of videos, you might struggle with the cardio a bit (it is not bad at all,  it is just not my preferred style).

If she came out with a weights only video, I would buy it in a heart beat. I'm going to have my laptop and TV side by side and pop in an Amy Dixon tabata video and do her cardio mixed with Anna's weight section and then do the weight section multiple times (I really liked it!)",1424908800,6,2128,4.148058252427185
6925316,5,B00R9SRADQ,"This video is terrific. Challenging, high energy, fun to do - little bit addictive. Not crazy-dancey, don't be intimidated if you're not used to choreography. Strength training intervals feature different moves than most and really make you work. Good stuff!",1424908800,,258,5.475
6925317,4,B00R9SRADQ,"Typically, I workout with Kelly Coffey-Meyer and Cathe Friedrich, in addition to gym workouts and running.  So, I deliberately ordered this because it is so different from all my other workout types, and that is why I will probably reach for it, to shake things up fitness-wise, every 2 weeks or so.  More than that I could not handle though.  Anna gives you 4 cardio segments.  She uses one as an extended warm-up, and then uses all 3 remaining segments to teach you just 1 simple cardio routine.  It is easy to learn and Anna cues quite well. Problem is, the main routine is repeated so many times that a lot of break down isn't needed and I got bored.  She has the opportunity here to introduce 4 different cardio routines in the entire workout, but does not do so.  I wish she had.  Workouts are for the brain too, and with routines this simple and easy to learn, and with her good cueing, we can certainly handle learning 4 different routines.  Since we have purchased this DVD to use for the long haul, more variety in the cardio dance segments is most definitely needed.  So, I can't rate this DVD above 4 stars.  The lower body moves are excellent and you will feel these!  The upper body work, though, was not much to my liking.  I couldn't go much heavier than 5s and 3s for hand weights as it is all so fast paced.  Hence, we can't really call this upper body strengthening, just toning.  I'll stick with Kelly and Cathe for my strength training!  Anna also does not make it clear exactly how each move benefits the upper body muscle groups: I would have liked to have known, so I could improve my form.  I felt like I was ""flailing around"" somewhat in this section due to lack of direction and fast pace.  The core section is also well done.  Anna says she and her crew do this workout every day: I couldn't.  The high level of repetition and the lack of real strength training for the upper body would make me bored and would not lead to total body fitness.  Still, this workout has its place in my (large) collection of workout DVDs.  However, I do not think there is enough variety here to merit the $29 price tag.  Cathe and Kelly DVDs are cheaper and better value for money as they include so much variety per DVD.  I hope Anna will take some of these comments on board as she entertains the idea of a second DVD workout release.  I'd like to workout with her further and see what else she has up her sleeve.  I like her personality a lot.",1424736000,3,2456,4.3428571428571425
6925318,5,B00R9SRADQ,"I knew who Anna was but I did not know she had a DVD so scrolling on Amazon I found this gem, it is sooo worth the money! This is a complete workout,plyo,cardio,weights(light) but you will feel it all over. I love the choreography and the music is great then you add her vibrant and motivating personality and believe me you will not be disappointed. I already complete a week and my body feels great and up for more,I'm going to buy another dvd because this one will be worn out!",1424476800,,480,4.285714285714286
6925319,5,B00R9SRADQ,"I love to run in the warmer months, but come winter time I'm in the house working out with a variety of DVD's. I love workouts like Turbo Fire and Insanity, but needed something new and fun. It turns out, Anna Kaiser's Happy Hour was just what I needed. I don't consider myself a dancer, or even coordinated, but I can follow this workout. Anna breaks down each part of the routine making it easy to follow. I wasn't sure if I would sweat the way I do during other activities, but from beginning to end of this video, my heart rate is up and yes, I sweat much. The strength portions of the video are intense. I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, but these parts of the video are challenging to me so much. My goal is to be able to finish with completing all reps, not there yet. Although this video is repetitious as others have noted, the repetition makes it easy for me to follow, and setting goals (like finishing all leg reps without sitting once) completely appropriate. Anna is motivating, bubbly, and this workout is fun. If only it came with a mini disco ball like she has in her studio.",1424390400,,1104,4.3125

6925321,5,B00R9SRADQ,"I stumbled, by accident, across an article regarding this ""gem"" of a workout DVD in a fitness post online.  I am a collector of FUN and EXCITING workout DVDs, and immeditely knew this one HAD to be added to my collection.

In a nutshell, this workout is the perfect, get-it-all-done-in-one TRIFECTA!  Cardio, strength and flexibility and stretching all on one DVD.  There are modifications for all levels of exercisors, from beginner to advanced.  This workout is about 80 minutes in duration, and includes a upbeat warm up, followed by two cardio/dance sequences that are interspersed with upper body, lower body and abdominal work.  I am notorious for having two left feet, and I can't dance to save my life, but the routines on this DVD we're very easy to follow, and FUN!  The footwork is all very repetitive, and you have plenty of time to catch on.  I felt like I was dancing in a music video.  The routines fit somewhere along the spectrum of kickboxing, ballet and Zumba.

I used 3 lb. handweights for this routine, and they certainly felt adequate for the upper body moves.  The strength moves we're not just your simple bicep curls and squats, but rather, more functional moves, incorporating multple body parts at one time.  The core/abdominal exercises targeted the entire abdominal wall.

I highly enjoyed this workout DVD.  I couldn't beleive how quickly time passed when I was HAVING FUN working out!  Was this DVD easy?  Certainly not.  Was it challenging?  YES, but not to the point that I wanted to give up and turn the DVD off, and not so hard that beginners couldn't complete.  This DVD can be broken into segements, or done it it's entirety based on your schedule and preferences, making it highly versatile.

The only negative of this DVD is that it does require some space, roughly 5-6 feet on each side, and in front and behind, so it is not easily done in small spaces.  There we're a few moves in the dancing sequences that could have been demo'ed that we're not.  I just paused the DVD and practiced until I got the hang of it.  :)

To Note; I am a 5'7 female in her 30's.  I burned 910 calories during my first attempt at this DVD.  I would expect this number to increase with future rounds, as my first run thru had a bit more of a learning curve.

THANK YOU Anna, AKT and crew for offering this workout to the masses.  While my heart and soul long for NYC, unfortunately I am stuck here in the middle of the states, where I cannot get to a live class and this is the next best thing!  I look forward to other DVDs in the future!",1422921600,24,2558,4.5

8694709,1,B00R9SRADQ,"Argh#@!$... I sooooo hated this work out.  It is beyond ""annoying"",  from music to constant yelling of instructor , the choreography "" annoying "".
The weight section "" roll my eyes"" hardly anything useful .
So much hype about this DVD and I think it is total garbage, won't put it into my DVD player again. I waited so long for it to be available in Canada, this was a MAJOR disappointment.
Maybe a Cheerleader would like it or a retired Cheerleader?!
I would recommend Christine Bullock's DVD's way over this workout, her dance workout in EVOLUTION 20 is easy to follow and one get way more value for the money.",1512518400,,612,4.504504504504505

Anna is super fun and keeps you feeling energized. Her workout seriously works every muscle in your body and leaves you sweaty to the max. I def recommend this or AKT On Demand if you want to be flexible with your workouts / travel a lot :),1489622400,,376,4.094594594594595
8694712,4,B00R9SRADQ,"The pros and cons of this DVD are pretty clear: on the good side, it will absolutely kick your booty, even if you're an advanced exerciser. It's a big time commitment for a DVD (over an hour), but you feel so accomplished at the end because you work absolutely every inch of your body - hard. It's easy to follow and it's effective, and a lot of the strength moves are really creative and efficient.  The biggest con is that the dance/cardio portions, particularly in the beginning are extremely repetitive and boring.  Other reviews have noted this, and it's true.  If you can get past that (adding your own music and freestyling a bit will help), you'll enjoy the bang you get for your buck here, and you will see results.",1489449600,,724,4.511450381679389

My heart rate was up the entire workout as well. Anna herself is very charismatic but not over the top like some instructors on fitness videos can be. She genuinely seemed to be having fun, which motivated me to want to have fun too. I wish there were more DVDs, but I plan on streaming the workouts on her website once I get tired of this DVD.",1473552000,,508,4.247422680412371
