8533389,3,B0090SI4Q0,"This is a story about modern lives, something most of us have experienced from one side of the coin or another. Bryce (Lance Gross) and Judith (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) have been together since childhood in a good Christian relationship. As work wears them down, they become content, if not boring as Bryce forgets her birthday...again. Bryce is very straight. Judith wants to experiment and grow. When Judith meets a man who listens to her and says all the right things she becomes tempted, hence the title of the film.

The film moves slow. It builds character. Since it is a Tyler Perry production, the dialouge is mildly humorous with Kim Kardashian giving Judith fashion advice. Perhaps the best way to describe it would be a Christian soap opera, light on the religion. At times the lines and situation appears stiff and forced as Judith comes out of character.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Off screen implied sex. The thing missing from this film was The Free Movement's ""I've Found Someone Of My Own"" during the closing credits.

""The Marriage Counselor"" is the working title for ""Temptation...""",1365206400,5,1110,4.956989247311828
