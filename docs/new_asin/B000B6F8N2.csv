8082558,3,B000B6F8N2,"Once upon a time, just after the horrors of the second world war, television became a cheap means of escape from reality. Therefore, the TV series were rarely based in any way on reality. Such a series was ""Champion, the Wonder Horse"" (and Gene Autry never appears.) A silly series to help you relax. There are at least two horses that play Champion -- a horse with a dark mane who specialized in rearing and the British-born light-maned Champ. If you look hard enough, you can see a very thin bridle/hackamore used on Champ. But the real hero of the show is the dog, Rebel (played by Blaze although Wikipedia states the dog was named JR). What German Shepherds used to look like, Rebel not only has a large repertoire of tricks and a penchant for always biting the right arm of any attacker but is also apparently bullet-proof. This is not a complete series -- only 8 episodes. Sadly, two episodes of the series are missing (as in NO ONE can find them) but I suppose no one is looking particularly hard for them.",1517270400,,1013,4.481081081081081
