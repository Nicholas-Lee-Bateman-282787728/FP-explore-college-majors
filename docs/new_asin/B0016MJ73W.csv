3160517,5,B0016MJ73W,"The 'slim packaging' concept is truly a great experience. The weight of the complete series (9 dvds) is so much less and the size so small that it takes a lesser amount of real-estate space on the shelf. People who thought of this packing concept are to be commended on taking into consideration the size & weight problems with our ever-growing dvd collection. Consider if the same set was packed in 14mm dvd cases or even the slimmer 7mm dvd cases:the whole thing would STILL be quite large and heavy. People who complain about the slim packaging really don't know what's good for them ; they really don't have a clue.
Picture quality is as excellent as any Seventies show quality is ; I don't have any problems here either.
A very good show at very good price in very convenient packing. One cannot go wrong here.",1303948800,3,815,4.551020408163265
3160518,5,B0016MJ73W,I love what's happening & bought the entire series. This purchase didn't put a dent in my wallet. Get it while it's cheap & available.,1300492800,,134,4.4
3160519,5,B0016MJ73W,"I really enjoyed watching this show as a child when it was in syndication years ago.  I am so glad I have TV shows like this on DVD to watch whenever I want to, instead of the mindless, irritating reality shows of today. Excellent quality transfer, very entertaining, highly recommended. Just buy a CD book to put the DVD's in because they will get damaged the way they are packaged with all the discs stacked directly on top of each other.",1294790400,29,440,4.432098765432099
3160520,1,B0016MJ73W,"I really, really wish I could rate this video.

3160521,5,B0016MJ73W,"What a deal!!!  I am so glad I purchased this set and didn't mind the slim packaging.

3160587,5,B0016MJ73W,"Anybody who previously bought either the individual season sets or the big, bulky series set originally put out by Sony are highly advised to sell those sets and get *this* one - especially if you are getting tired of watching all those by-now-dated promos for other Sony TV on DVD sets, unrelated extras (think ""minisodes""), and also now-dated promos for then-upcoming theatrical films distributed by Sony.

This Mill Creek reissue contains only *the original, uncut episodes and nothing but!* *No* extras, commercials - *none* of that stuff (and, it's space-saving and shelf-friendly besides)!

But as for ""What's Happening!!"" itself: this was one of my favorite shows when I was a teenager back in the 70's (I was only 14 when it premiered  in September 1976). Two episodes from the first season are my all-time favorites: ""The Birthday Present,"" in which Raj, Dwayne, and Rerun buy a blouse for Mrs. Thomas' birthday which she believes is ""hot;"" and ""The Tickets,"" in which Raj, Dwayne, and Rerun are arrested for scalping a pair of tickets to a Stevie Wonder concert - the ending of that one is *so* funny, but I *won't* reveal it for fear of a spoiler. (In the case of ""The Birthday Present,"" however, that one holds some special memories for me because when ABC repeated that one on Thursday, July 7, 1977, I had won a T-shirt from a local radio station an hour earlier - the first thing I ever won in my life, and also the first time I ever heard myself on the radio! But, that's another story.)

By contrast, however, the only two episodes I *didn't* care for were from the last season: ""No Clothes Make the Man"" and the series' final episode, ""The Benefit Show"" (especially when David Hollander does an impression of a nauseating, all-time UNfavorite of mine, for which I had to hit fast-forward) - but, to paraphrase an old adage, ""Two bad apples don't spoil the whole bunch,"" especially since this show was *consistently* funny and enjoyable for the memories of my ""wonder years"" it holds.

So, if you need more shelf space and want to see *only* the episodes and not endure *any* ""back-patting"" for the manufacturer's other (dated) products - I *strongly* recommend this Mill Creek reprint of ""What's Happening!!"" It's also *cheaper* than the original Sony sets!",1504742400,4,2275,4.823076923076923

3160590,5,B0016MJ73W,Here was a show that had you laughing. All the actors had their own part they added to the show. If you watched it a while the show wouldn't have been the same if one was gone. Mama was one of my favorites she took no back talk from her two kids. They respected Mama and she would punish both no matter how old they were. They were good kids and not out destroying property. Not perfect but knew not to push Mama to far.,1500336000,,420,3.9529411764705884
3160591,4,B0016MJ73W,Funny shows. Only complaint is the picture quality is not re-mastered at all..not sure if it's because they cannot do it or because the cost it would take of making them look better.

You cannot go wrong with this price for an entire series of a class sitcom!!! I saw that a few people were not liking the packaging that the show comes in, but it clearly states ""slim packaging"" and you are getting what you paid for...the show! This set contains all 65 episodes (three seasons) on 9 discs. The main cover/case opens up with a flap (like a book) and the ""container"" slides out where all the discs are stacked on a spool of sorts. My discs have not gotten scratched at all and play great. You're not really paying for the ""fancy-shmancy"" packaging, but rather the actual show. You can't go wrong here! Excellent show for a great price!",1381276800,14,815,4.54421768707483

The show is a cultural archive; I love seeing how we dressed back in the 70s ... and huge afros back ... and the tight fitting pants. I am happy to own and add the series to my DVD collection. The slim, budget packaging is no problem for they (they basically come on a spindle, just like when you buy blank cd/dvds); with care there should be no problem, but I wish there was some padding between each DVD, but so far no problems. There are 9 DVDs in the series, and I paid $24, so that is only $2.66 per DVD, that is a great bargain.",1370995200,3,691,4.203007518796992

3160865,5,B0016MJ73W,"I remember watching this show as a kid.  I absolutely love this DVD set, which I received as a Christmas gift.  I've had no problems whatsoever with any of the discs.  The quality is as good as the original show, which was not as good as ""modern"" shows, but it's fine for me.  The sound and video are just fine.  The DVD packaging is cheap, but so is the price.  I ripped all the episodes to my home server using WinXdvd Platinum and watch them from the rips now - fantastic.

One thing I really like about the show itself is that these are good kids.  Sure they get into trouble, but they suffer the consequences, like real life.  There's a lot of ""fat"" jokes, but that's just part of the show, and Rerun gives them back as much as he gets them.  It's all in good fun.  Mabel King is a caring, honest woman who disciplines (God forbid!) her kids when they need it, and sees the value in people regardless of color, religion or anything else.  Shirley is a hard worker with a bit of an attitude, but a heart of gold.  Dee is obnoxious, but funny, and smart - and her character develops well in the first several episodes.  Roger, Dwayne and Rerun are true friends.

It's a good show.  Period.",1361318400,6,1192,4.254464285714286
3160866,4,B0016MJ73W,"This DVD collection features all of the episodes from the three seasons on network television. The sitcom is inspired by Cooley High and I don't honestly know what that was or is. I do remember watching ""What's Happening!"" in syndication in the 1980s when local stations still reran sitcoms to fill the daytime slots. The show is set in urban Los Angeles, California with a gang of three best guy friends, Raj (Ernest Thomas); Dwayne (Haywood Nelson); and Rerun (Fred Berry). Raj has a younger bratty sister, Dee (Danielle Spencer) and their parents were divorced. Divorce was still a taboo topic until the 1980s in mainstream society. The series also featured the wonderful Mabel King (Navin's adopted mother in the film, ""The Jerk) and Shirley Hemphill (waitress at Rob's Place where the gang hangs out).

The sitcom tackled serious issues even in it's day. Raj was an aspiring writer while going to high school and working at the supermarket. This sitcom had a mother figure in both Mabel King and Shirley Hemphill. I'll never understand why the producers allowed Mabel King to leave the show. Supposedly, she was like Esther Rolle (Florida from Good Times) who insisted that there was a father figure in the series. Even though with divorce, Mr. Thomas played a part and reunited with his estranged children.

What's Happening! lasted only three seasons. I would have liked to have been more but the producers had other ideas for the show. We never saw Rerun or Dwayne's parents on the series for example. We watched Rerun and Raj move into their own place and have their own adventures. Still, money was a subject of not having enough in hard times in the 1970s. The cast is likable especially Shirley Hemphill who would take over the motherly role by moving into Mama Thomas's house, pay rent, and help raise Dee in the house.

Still despite the departure of Mabel King which I never could understand and still don't, the show bounced back and had memorable episodes like the Doobie brothers in a two part episode. I just watched the touching Christmas episode where the kids' father invites them over for Christmas dinner but Mabel doesn't feel comfortable to mention that she was given the day off. There are episodes that tackled pressing issues for teens especially African Americans in the 1970s Los Angeles, California.",1355356800,6,2331,4.8813131313131315

The weight of the complete series (9 dvds) is so much less and the size so small that it takes a lesser amount of real-estate space on the shelf. People who thought of this packing concept are to be commended on taking into consideration the size & weight problems with our ever-growing dvd collection. Consider if the same set was packed in 14mm dvd cases or even the slimmer 7mm dvd cases:the whole thing would STILL be quite large and heavy. People who complain about the slim packaging really don't know what's good for them ; they really don't have a clue.

3395084,5,B0016MJ73W,"Anybody who previously bought either the individual season sets or the big, bulky series set originally put out by Sony are highly advised to sell those sets and get *this* one - especially if you are getting tired of watching all those by-now-dated promos for other Sony TV on DVD sets, unrelated extras (think ""minisodes""), and also now-dated promos for then-upcoming theatrical films distributed by Sony.

This Mill Creek reissue contains only *the original, uncut episodes and nothing but!* *No* extras, commercials - *none* of that stuff (and, it's space-saving and shelf-friendly besides)!

But as for ""What's Happening!!"" itself: this was one of my favorite shows when I was a teenager back in the 70's (I was only 14 when it premiered  in September 1976). Two episodes from the first season are my all-time favorites: ""The Birthday Present,"" in which Raj, Dwayne, and Rerun buy a blouse for Mrs. Thomas' birthday which she believes is ""hot;"" and ""The Tickets,"" in which Raj, Dwayne, and Rerun are arrested for scalping a pair of tickets to a Stevie Wonder concert - the ending of that one is *so* funny, but I *won't* reveal it for fear of a spoiler. (In the case of ""The Birthday Present,"" however, that one holds some special memories for me because when ABC repeated that one on Thursday, July 7, 1977, I had won a T-shirt from a local radio station an hour earlier - the first thing I ever won in my life, and also the first time I ever heard myself on the radio! But, that's another story.)

By contrast, however, the only two episodes I *didn't* care for were from the last season: ""No Clothes Make the Man"" and the series' final episode, ""The Benefit Show"" (especially when David Hollander does an impression of a nauseating, all-time UNfavorite of mine, for which I had to hit fast-forward) - but, to paraphrase an old adage, ""Two bad apples don't spoil the whole bunch,"" especially since this show was *consistently* funny and enjoyable for the memories of my ""wonder years"" it holds.

So, if you need more shelf space and want to see *only* the episodes and not endure *any* ""back-patting"" for the manufacturer's other (dated) products - I *strongly* recommend this Mill Creek reprint of ""What's Happening!!"" It's also *cheaper* than the original Sony sets!",1504742400,4,2275,4.823076923076923

3395087,5,B0016MJ73W,Here was a show that had you laughing. All the actors had their own part they added to the show. If you watched it a while the show wouldn't have been the same if one was gone. Mama was one of my favorites she took no back talk from her two kids. They respected Mama and she would punish both no matter how old they were. They were good kids and not out destroying property. Not perfect but knew not to push Mama to far.,1500336000,,420,3.9529411764705884

You cannot go wrong with this price for an entire series of a class sitcom!!! I saw that a few people were not liking the packaging that the show comes in, but it clearly states ""slim packaging"" and you are getting what you paid for...the show! This set contains all 65 episodes (three seasons) on 9 discs. The main cover/case opens up with a flap (like a book) and the ""container"" slides out where all the discs are stacked on a spool of sorts. My discs have not gotten scratched at all and play great. You're not really paying for the ""fancy-shmancy"" packaging, but rather the actual show. You can't go wrong here! Excellent show for a great price!",1381276800,14,815,4.54421768707483

The show is a cultural archive; I love seeing how we dressed back in the 70s ... and huge afros back ... and the tight fitting pants. I am happy to own and add the series to my DVD collection. The slim, budget packaging is no problem for they (they basically come on a spindle, just like when you buy blank cd/dvds); with care there should be no problem, but I wish there was some padding between each DVD, but so far no problems. There are 9 DVDs in the series, and I paid $24, so that is only $2.66 per DVD, that is a great bargain.",1370995200,3,691,4.203007518796992

3395362,5,B0016MJ73W,"I remember watching this show as a kid.  I absolutely love this DVD set, which I received as a Christmas gift.  I've had no problems whatsoever with any of the discs.  The quality is as good as the original show, which was not as good as ""modern"" shows, but it's fine for me.  The sound and video are just fine.  The DVD packaging is cheap, but so is the price.  I ripped all the episodes to my home server using WinXdvd Platinum and watch them from the rips now - fantastic.

One thing I really like about the show itself is that these are good kids.  Sure they get into trouble, but they suffer the consequences, like real life.  There's a lot of ""fat"" jokes, but that's just part of the show, and Rerun gives them back as much as he gets them.  It's all in good fun.  Mabel King is a caring, honest woman who disciplines (God forbid!) her kids when they need it, and sees the value in people regardless of color, religion or anything else.  Shirley is a hard worker with a bit of an attitude, but a heart of gold.  Dee is obnoxious, but funny, and smart - and her character develops well in the first several episodes.  Roger, Dwayne and Rerun are true friends.

It's a good show.  Period.",1361318400,6,1192,4.254464285714286
3395363,4,B0016MJ73W,"This DVD collection features all of the episodes from the three seasons on network television. The sitcom is inspired by Cooley High and I don't honestly know what that was or is. I do remember watching ""What's Happening!"" in syndication in the 1980s when local stations still reran sitcoms to fill the daytime slots. The show is set in urban Los Angeles, California with a gang of three best guy friends, Raj (Ernest Thomas); Dwayne (Haywood Nelson); and Rerun (Fred Berry). Raj has a younger bratty sister, Dee (Danielle Spencer) and their parents were divorced. Divorce was still a taboo topic until the 1980s in mainstream society. The series also featured the wonderful Mabel King (Navin's adopted mother in the film, ""The Jerk) and Shirley Hemphill (waitress at Rob's Place where the gang hangs out).

The sitcom tackled serious issues even in it's day. Raj was an aspiring writer while going to high school and working at the supermarket. This sitcom had a mother figure in both Mabel King and Shirley Hemphill. I'll never understand why the producers allowed Mabel King to leave the show. Supposedly, she was like Esther Rolle (Florida from Good Times) who insisted that there was a father figure in the series. Even though with divorce, Mr. Thomas played a part and reunited with his estranged children.

What's Happening! lasted only three seasons. I would have liked to have been more but the producers had other ideas for the show. We never saw Rerun or Dwayne's parents on the series for example. We watched Rerun and Raj move into their own place and have their own adventures. Still, money was a subject of not having enough in hard times in the 1970s. The cast is likable especially Shirley Hemphill who would take over the motherly role by moving into Mama Thomas's house, pay rent, and help raise Dee in the house.

Still despite the departure of Mabel King which I never could understand and still don't, the show bounced back and had memorable episodes like the Doobie brothers in a two part episode. I just watched the touching Christmas episode where the kids' father invites them over for Christmas dinner but Mabel doesn't feel comfortable to mention that she was given the day off. There are episodes that tackled pressing issues for teens especially African Americans in the 1970s Los Angeles, California.",1355356800,6,2331,4.8813131313131315
