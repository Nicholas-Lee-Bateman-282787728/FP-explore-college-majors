354160,5,6301782666,"I hadn't seen this movie since 1985 when it first came out and was excited to find it on DVD and it was a great as I remembered!  This is an original fantasy that is a lot of fun.  Mia Farrow is charming as Cecilia, a woman in the depression era who is addicted to movies.  Jeff Daniels plays the character from the movie ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" whom she fantasizes about.  The fun begins when Jeff Daniels character walks off the screen and into Cecilia's life.....but reality soon sets in when the REAL actor gets wind that his character has walked off the screen.....the movie is simply wonderful and forgoes the typical happy ending....favoring REALITY over fantasy.  Watch it you won't be disappointed.  Even if you don't care for Woody Allen movies, I know you'll love this one!",1020211200,5,787,4.585714285714285
354161,5,6301782666,"Woody Allen has long admired the works of both Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini, and while he has done other movies that intentionally (and not very successfully, in my opinion) mimic those two great directors, I think ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" is his better homage to Fellini.  He captures the same poignant combination of humor and pathos as Fellini does in his earlier masterpieces ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria.""  In fact, the concluding scene of Cecilia (Mia Farrow) staring at the movie screen, her eyes transforming from despair to hope (as her life has just gone down the toilet) is a mirror of the concluding scene in Fellini's ""Cabiria.""  This is also Allen's most loving tribute to ""the movies."" Movies allow us to escape to a better world and--at least temporarily--to escape our selves. The cast is great--especially the wonderful supporting characters who seem right out of the Depression era, as are those who play the movie characters who get stranded on-screen when one of their colleagues steps out into the real world. While this may not be one of Woody Allen's most popular films, it is a near-perfect little gem.",1017187200,19,1138,4.916666666666667
354162,4,6301782666,"Cecilia goes to the movies night after night, to escape her dreary life, and sees The Purple Rose of Cairo over and over.  Each time, we pick up little scenes from the movie that is unfolding within the  movie.  Imagine the surprise, when a scene we've watched before isn't quite right.  The Tom Baxter character seems distracted.  Is it possible he just glanced out into the audience?
This is exactly what Tom Baxter does, as he's noticed Ceclia watching the movie night after night.  We watch as he starts speaking to her as she sits in her theater seat and eventually he jumps down off of the screen to the surprise of the audience and the cast of the Purple Rose of Cairo.
The comedy is great, as the movie cast can't proceed without Tom.  They start to bicker amongst themselves and even take out their frustration on the audience...""You think you've got problems?  We've got problems of our own!""  Tom and Ceclia begin an offscreen adventure that makes clever use of the fact that Tom isn't actually a real person.  There are plenty of gags and some great lines, particularly when Cecila proclaims that she's finally met the perfect man, ""although he is fictional.""
This is one of my favorite Allen films that doesn't actually star Allen.  I'm happy that this movie, along with Hannah and Her Sisters, Broadway Danny Rose and Play it again Sam, have finally been released on DVD.  This is a typical no-frills MGM release, with the movie in widescreen format, the theatrical trailer, and optional subtitles.",1005177600,,1512,4.729007633587786

354695,5,6301782666,I had to interrupt watching the film to write this. A terrific movie ! It's like a cross between The Wizard of Oz and The Matrix. Mixes the nostalgia of 1930s Hollywood with the dreamlike scenario of people walking (waking ?) into a parallel world. Woody Allen created a masterpiece with this one.

354696,5,6301782666,"This is a fairly short, very well made film.  It is simply a cleanly assembled film, nothing fancy to it or the story, yet this simplicity adds a sweetness to the film that is refreshing.  Just can't really find anything wrong with this film.  Of course, some won't like it IF they just can't tolerate stories that have a sense of the romantic and playfulness, and a story that is impossible but fun!  Woody Allen shows he is a good film maker here, once again.  I don't always agree with or share Mr. Allen's perspective on life, but I enjoy seeing it portrayed, thinking about it, and taking off on the landing which he establishes---which takes me further on my own path of understanding my own takes on life---and that is what art and film can quite often be about.  As always, this film has a perfectly cast set of actors.",1439337600,3,827,4.443708609271523

On the plus side, Mia Farrow was perfect in the lead role, I can't think of any other actress who would have been better in this part.

I did NOT like Jeff Daniels though, I thought he gave a ho-hum performance and could have easily been replaced by a number of other actors in this role, easily.

The story starts out well but about half-way through it starts to ramble on and on and gets rather boring. I also didn't like the ending.

Woody Allen but NOT at his best.",1437782400,,550,4.259615384615385

The crossover from reality to fantasy to reality was a cinematically mind bending experience of the best kind.  A sea change film that may not seem like much but convinced the world Woody Allen was no one-hit wonder.  In its own way, IMHO. it is up there with Hannah and Her Sisters as a must see and a far more important film than Annie Hall (except for the Christopher Walken scenes, Holy Smoke!).  Again, IMHO, we all have favorites and these should never in be in a conversation of ""...'s Best Work.""

354800,5,6301782666,"It seems very Woody Allen to present characters in a world that seem to just go with the flow, and when a character from a black-and-white movie decides to leave the film and enter our real world, chaos ensues - but not because characters are terrified that they happened. It's more that the lead female becomes shocked, the audience becomes annoyed, the black-and-white film characters are confused, and the producers of the black-and-white film seem only concerned with the reputation they will have because of this outbreak. I personally love this kind of humor, and the performances are great. it's along the same magical qualities as Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris, though maybe with less stardom and recognizable cameos. Still, I would give this film a chance if you enjoyed MiP or other Allen comedies - but this is not with the same tone as something like Zelig, Sleeper, or Love and Death. Maybe a little like Love and Death, possibly like Annie Hall, but closest to Midnight in Paris. Nonetheless, the script is clever and it's a film that is light with a lot of intrigue when the characters rediscover themselves.",1426464000,2,1125,4.864583333333333

354802,4,6301782666,"Jeff Daniels plays an actor who played a character in an escapist film, and Mia Farrow plays a woman who needs to escape. In this movie about people's intimate relationship with movies, virtually every meta- angle is explored, with humor and heart. The ideas are not new: at issue are the distinctions between movie problems and real world problems, celluloid romance and real life love, the idealism that art reflects and the cynical business of making art. It is, however, rare for a film to be able to critique its own medium without abandoning the medium's conventions; it is difficult to be truly experimental and yet to tell a relatable story with a familiar dramatic arc. ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" finds a way, and it works as both a commentary on classical movie stories and as a classical movie story in its own right.

Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) is a minor character in a big RKO release sometime in the 1930s, a decade when incomes were down but box office revenues were up. He is earnest and heroic and wealthy and romantic because it's ""written in his character"" to be those things. When he meets Mia Farrow's Cecilia, a woman from the real world, he is a breath of fresh air from her distinctly unromantic problems of poverty and an unhappy marriage. Baxter doesn't know about the Depression, about brothels, even about God; those things aren't written, which provides an opening to discuss them and to contrast the world that is with the world that we like to imagine could be. Leaving no permutation unturned, the film also examines the downsides of life on the other side of the silver screen. Movie characters, were they to become cognizant, would face existential questions about the limits of their free will and about what happens to them when the projectors shut off. Though real people have more or less the same uncertainties, the film eschews the macabre and maintains a humorous tone. There are moments of real emotional weight, though, as when Cecilia must choose between Baxter and the man who brought him to life, Gil Shepherd, whose excuse for being less perfect than his creation is ""I'm real."" The darkest the film gets is the fatalistic final sequence in which Cecilia, having chosen to live in the real world and to experience the perfect life of movie characters only vicariously, is denied a Hollywood ending. Farrow's face is achingly expressive as it slowly changes over a few long shots.

It must have been difficult to create a rapport between the actors in the fictional movie and the actors watching the movie, and between the two characters played via split screen by Jeff Daniels, but the pace of the dialogue is steady and the jokes are well-timed. Yet the script is not Woody Allen's densest or wittiest. Some of the words feel ad libbed, even in crucial plot-moving scenes between Baxter, Shepherd, and Cecilia. There is also a fair amount of repetition despite the movie's short runtime. Some of this is essential, as in the two scenes when Cecilia's manipulative husband tells her she'll be back despite her apparent intention to leave him. But there is perhaps one scene too many of Hollywood producers debating and fictional movie characters bickering about the absence of a supposedly minor player. More interesting are the vignettes that explore the implications of Baxter's existence: what happens if he gets in a fight? What will he do for money? Can he make love without a Hays Code-era fade out? The movie's answers manage to be funny, touching, and thoughtful all at once.",1423094400,,3530,4.823432343234323

354804,5,6301782666,"Woody Allen takes on the subject of movies vs. reality, and does a great job of it. Both moving and funny, the Purple Rose of Cairo is the name of a film that a Depression era waitress, played by Mia Farrow, sees over and over again at her local movie theater in order to escape her life as a waitress with a husband who is an abusive gambler. Mocking her, he does not take away her self-confidence because she can escape to the movies. Nonetheless, Allen demonstrates that she has to be a little naive to believe that the movies are anywhere near real life, as much as they take us into our dreamworld for 90 minutes",1422144000,,617,4.282051282051282
354805,5,6301782666,"Twilight Time is showing itself to be one of the best independent companies when it comes to providing excellent Blu-ray presentations for fans and film collectors alike. Fans of Woody Allen can now celebrate once again with Twilight's release of ""The Purple Rose of Cairo""(1985) making it's Blu-ray debut this week. This is the fourth Allen film to be released by Twilight in the last year following ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", ""Broadway Danny Rose"" and ""Radio Days"" all from Allen's Orion Pictures period where he made over eleven films in a nine year span(1982-1991). Made right before ""Hannah and Her Sisters""(his most popular film during his Orion years), ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" is an enchanting romantic fantasy comedy that fits nicely as a companion piece to ""Radio Days"". The story takes place in 1935 during the height of the Great Depression and centers around Cecilia, a  clumsy New Jersey waitress played by Mia Farrow who escapes her loveless and abusive marriage by going to the movies and dreaming of a better life. It's what happens during the showing of a fictional  RKO film called ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" that sets the story in motion and the results are delightful to say the least. MGM(which owns the Orion catalog) has provided Twilight with an exceptional print for ""Rose"" and the cinematography by the great Gordon Willis is really on display now on Blu-ray. Willis uses a film stock that is similar to the one he used for ""The Godfather"" which makes the New Jersey locations all the more depressing for Cecilia but do not detract from the nostalgia of the story. The entire production design(Stuart Wurtzel) looks fabulous in Blu-ray which is really highlighted in the Art Direction(Edward Pisoni) and Set Decoration(Carol Joffe) so much so that it makes you feel the entire film was made in 1935 instead of 1985. This is very apparent in the B&W film that is projected in the theatre that Cecilia visits and where a lot of the action takes place(There is a poster in the lobby for the 1935 Ronald Colman film  ""Clive of India"" that tips viewers off concerning the time period of ""Rose""). Allen makes great use of locations, including the Bertrand Island Amusement Park and the Kent Theater with costumes and automobiles having a very authentic and lived in look that is brought out even more on Blu-ray. There are no vertical lines, torn or damage frames and only a few specks in what is overall an exceptional video presentation.  Acting honors once again must go to Mia Farrow who gives an exceptional performance as Cecilia. Farrow did some of her best work during her association with Woody Allen and that's certainly on display here. She gets great support from Danny Aiello and Jeff Daniels.  The Audio( English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.) ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" is 82 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.85:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include an isolated music score track and the theatrical trailer. There is an informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo also included. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a standard solid Blu-ray case(Note: I purchased this Blu-ray directly from Screen Archives Entertainment for a lot less than what some sellers are asking). If you are a fan of Woody Allen then Twilight's new Blu-ray of ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" should be essential to your film collection and comes highly recommended.",1421798400,5,3466,4.928082191780822

354910,1,6301782666,"Generally Woody Allen films are a hit in my home. Unfortunately, bad endings spell doom, even for an otherwise great film. This is one of those films. I've noticed, often times, critics will say, ""It was a great film with a bad ending"" and then give whatever film they're discussing a four out of five or eight out of ten. I just can't see it that way, no matter how I try. If an ending doesn't work, the film is a bust. I actually loved this film for a good portion of the show (in High Definition with lovely color and excellent detail, preserving original film grain), until it became apparent that this film, centering on a battered wife seeking solace in films during the hardships of the great depression and falling in love with a kind character who steps off the screen just to be with her, was actually one of Allen's commentaries on how much life sucks. He is known for his depressive attitudes and fascination with how horrible things always seem to turn out in life, which is why so many of his films tend toward the sadder ending. In this case, we see a film that Allen has described rather proudly as having been one of the few to ever turn out close to what he intended (and what he intends is nearly always a sad, more realistic ending). So, even though this film is all about us people, out here in the real world, in hard situations that we can't control, turning to the screen and seeking comfort in cinema, he missed the point entirely of making a film for that particular audience and ended up beating that very specific audience over the head with his personal sadness, as if to say, ""No. There is no comfort. Life is terrible. Deal with it. Ha ha."" This attitude is actually part of why I adore Woody Allen, as my father is a profound depressive and pessimist as well, and in so many of Allen's films this attitude yields a fitting ending while reminding me of my dear old Dad. This film however, was too romantic, too sweet and too on point with the human experience of seeking escape in cinema, at least in the way I interpreted it, as a viewer, for me to have felt anything other than slapped in the face by the horrible ending. I won't say exactly what it was because I'm not a fan of spoilers myself, but I will say that if you are seeking a happy story, don't watch this. Wait to see this one until you are in the mood to cry and feel sorry for a woman who reminds you of yourself or a woman you care deeply for. This female character was deliberately never fully fleshed out so as to allow most of us to see ourselves in her and, as usual, Allen's character development strategy was horribly effective. I felt I would never love again after watching this film, for about two days and it is one of only a few Allen films I can never watch again. Good luck with this one, if you've never seen it.

355086,5,6301782666,"This is possibly woody allen's most imaginative screenplay.  he has a movie character (played by jeff daniels in the role which made his career) leave the silver screen one day because ""he"" wants to escape to real life.  he meets a woman mired in the Great Depression, mia farrow, and falls in love with her.  that would have been enough for most writers without adding more but allen has got a lot more to tell in this story.  chiefly, he is juxtaposing real life with our imaginary and fantasy lives and then crossing back and forth between them.  he even gives the farrow character choices of a reality lover vs. a fantasy one.  it is really a very profound work.

both daniels and farrow are excellent here.  once again i marvel at how underrated farrow has been as an actress.  ironically she is still best known for ROSEMARY'S BABY even though she left that long ago role in the dust with all the roles she filmed with allen. she is just perfect here and although daniels has the showier role, the whole thing would fail without her character being perfectly realized.

michael keaton was originally cast in the daniels' role but woody allen after filming several days with him thought he was not right for the character.  i think allen was right.  keaton was just too hard edged for this role. keaton was a big star at the time and had never been fired so this was not an amicable breakup.

if this film had been made in europe by some unknown, it would have been heralded far and wide.  since it was american and made by allen, it was consistently underrated when it was released.  it is a masterwork and should be regarded as such.

355163,5,6301782666,"Over the past weekend, I watched this movie with my wife and daughter. While we've seen plenty of Woody Allen films, somehow we'd missed this gem from the mid-'80's. Viewing this movie, set in the Great Depression of the 1930's, is probably a more uncomfortable experience today in 2013 than when it was first made nearly 30 years ago. With the shadow of the Great Recession of 2008 still hanging over us, the real-world context of this movie feels a lot more uncomfortable and a lot less nostaglic than when the movie was originally released. In  any case, this is Woody Allen in his heyday, a fundamentally fun movie that, nevertheless, offers you the opportunity to reflect on deeper issues, like what is reality and what is fantasy and, ultimately, which is preferable. The answer's not as clear as you might think. In some ways, this movie is a love letter to the Golden Age of Hollywood mixed with a bit ""Six Characters in Search of an Author,"" which gives it both a bittersweet twinge and an existential angsty edge.

After she attends the same movie every single night, one of the actors (Jeff Daniels) turns from what he's supposed to do on-screen, speaks to Mia, steps OUT of the movie and has a romance with her while fellow film players left behind wonder what the heck to do.

355254,5,6301782666,"An utterly sweet, inventive and charming film that examines our love
affair with the movies and our need to escape into fantasy. The central
device of the wall breaking down between the characters in a film and
those watching is great fun, and both Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels do
some of their very best work in this.

That said, for me, it lacks a little of the depth and complexity of my
very favorite Allen films. It's a little too cute and simplistic
in the middle, although the first and last third, and the uncompromised
ending are terrific. It doesn't quite hold up on multiple viewings
the way 'Annie Hall', or 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' or 'Hannah and Her
Sisters' or 'Zelig' do. But even 2nd tier Woody Allen is better than
almost anything else out there. And on a certain level, with great
filmmakers its about personal taste, not right and wrong. (e.g. Is Chapln's
'Modern Times' better than 'City Lights' ?) So, if you like Allen's
work at all and you've never seen this, you owe yourself a look to

355388,3,6301782666,"It surprises me to learn that this is Woody Allen's favorite among his films, because in my opinion he has made many movies that were much better, with some of his best work of all appearing in the last decade*. Watching this film reminds me of reading a first draft of a manuscript in that it came off as roughly sketched and unfinished, and the ending, a surprise I admit as well as being admirably bold, seemed to come along in place of an entire missing act in the story. (OK, I understand perhaps WHY The Purple Rose of Cairo ended as it did but should it truly have ended WHEN it did?) My words here are meaningless, I know, since those who love this film have their reasons for loving it, it's obviously long since too late to change anything, and I'm not here to discourage someone from seeing it, but I will say that this wasn't the movie I was expecting and it wasn't one I came away from feeling like I'd want to see it again.

355390,5,6301782666,"The word that comes to my mind when I see this film is balance. Like a game of catch the elements of this story are lightly moved along to form a picture that is fun and charming. After more than 25 years it hasn't become dated. Jeff Daniels is handsome and 'adorable' in the double roles of Tom Baxter and Gil Shepherd, Mia Farrow is like a sweet doll playing along; a refugee from reality suddenly overwhelmed by the world she'd escaped into. While the story could be simply a romance there are loose ends and pitfalls that aren't neatly sidestepped or explained away. The film doesn't have a 'happily ever after' end, it has 'what abouts..' and 'what ifs..' that bring the viewer back to watch the game again.",1325030400,,712,4.484615384615385
355391,5,6301782666,"I think everyone is familiar with idealization. Idealization is, after all, what we always do. It is how we deal with the real, we adapt it in a way that can provides us with reassurance, with a certain logic. Philosophers like Zizek would affirm that, in fact, fantasy can be stronger than reality. Because, in the end, what is reality but an amount of statements and common sense that we all agree upon?

Cecilia, a waitress trying to survive in the middle of the greatest financial depression in America, lives a common life. She barely makes enough money to get by, she's married to an abusive, alcoholic and jobless man. And she has no real future ahead of her, rather than spend her youth, her whole life washing dishes in the local diner.

Her only cheerful moments take place in the cinema. She goes every day and watches the same movie. For a couple of hours she feels transported into a world of glamour, of beautiful men and women, a world in which everything makes sense, a world where happy endings are possible. In an era of poverty, movies are the ideal escapism. Movies are a window that allows the impoverished people to see life not as it is but as it could or should be.

Woody Allen is not only a great director but also a true connoisseur of cinema. Hollywood's films in the 20s relied deeply on spectacular images just as they do now, but what today is CGI (and explosions or big action sequences), decades ago was grand sets, hundreds of extras, complex choreographies, exotic scenarios and so on. That's the kind of films that Cecilia has access to. And as enamored as she is with this world of richness and splendor, she must come to reality and accept the hardships of life.

That is of course, until Tom Baxter, the adventurer, the handsome hero from the film, starts talking to her through the screen. He knows she loves the movie, she's been there every day. And he knows he loves her. And just like that, Tom Baxter is no longer a black and white, two dimensional character, he is now a person walking out of the screen and reaching out to her.

It happens in the movies, but it can also happen in real life: love at first sight. Cecilia and Tom are in love, but she doesn't know how to deal with this strange situation. He is a fictional character, he has never been in the real world, and he carries a certain naivet but also a certain magic, a sense of wonder that reminds her that being alive, and making choices, is all that matters.

With a very ironic venue, Woody Allen reminds us that Hollywood is a cruel machinery in which profits and lawyers are more important than directors or actors. And once that these businessmen realize that the impossible has happened in New Jersey, they decide to fix the situation. Giles Shepherd, the actor that plays Tom Baxter, is worried about having a duplicate of him running amok in the streets. He has a career to protect, a reputation to uphold. When he discovers that Cecilia knows where to find Tom Baxter he tries to convince his creation to return to the screen, where he belongs, but to no avail.

Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan used to say that desire towards our 'object a' depends on the phantasm (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ecrits-The-First-Complete-Edition-in-English/dp/0393329259/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ecrits: The First Complete Edition in English</a>); which in a way means that the object of our desire is never ours, our thirst is never quenched and we are doomed to unsatisfactory pursuits, always. This happens because the object of desire comes to us mediated through a veil that conceals the real, and thus strengthens what in this case is only an idealized image, a reflection of something that doesn't necessarily has to be there although that is all our eyes can see. Tom Baxter is the mirrored ideal that originates from Giles Shepherd, but at the same time, both are the ideal partners for Cecilia. One of them is fictitious and because of that he is also perfect; the other one is human, flawed, but authentic.

As the days go by, Cecilia falls in love with Giles, and dreams of leaving behind an awful reality, a mediocre existence. At the same time, she has some of the most amazing experiences of her life with Tom Baxter, as he takes her into the screen and into the very world she has always fantasized about. He takes her to the exclusive clubs and the mansions she had only seen in screen. He makes her know a new world, visually stunning; a black and white universe where things have a way of always working out in the end.

And then comes a moment, a moment in which she has to make a decision. Will she stay with Tom Baxter or Giles Shepherd? The character or the actor? The fiction or the reality? The ideal or the real? Making decisions is what makes us humans, but then again, pain, hunger, poverty and decay inevitably come with humanity. I won't spoil the ending, but suffice to say that I have never seen a greater, sadder and more significant sacrifice than the one seen here. The Purple Rose of Cairo is truly one of the most magnificent classics ever.",1320796800,,5118,4.671476137624861

device of the wall breaking down between the characters in a film and

That said, for me, it lacks a little of the depth and complexity of my
very favorite Allen films. It's a little too cute and simplistic

ending are terrific. It doesn't quite hold up on multiple viewings
the way 'Annie Hall', or 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' or 'Hannah and Her
Sisters' or 'Zelig' do. But even 2nd tier Woody Allen is better than
almost anything else out there. And on a certain level, with great
filmmakers its about personal taste, not right and wrong. (e.g. Is Chapln's
'Modern Times' better than 'City Lights' ?) So, if you like Allen's

Nonetheless, it was done well here and I got a kick out of watching it back in the '80s as part  of a good fantasy, romance, drama and comedy film by Woody Allen, who made this movie but is not on screen.

Jeff Daniels does a terrific job in a dual role, playing Tom Baxter and Gil Shepherd. One an actor, the other a ""real-life"" guy. Mia Farrow is appealing, as she usually was, as ""Cecilia."" Danny Aiello is another usually-interesting actor who gets your attention no matter who he is playing.

355508,5,6301782666,"If there is one Woody Allen film that I think anyone can enjoy, it is `The Purple Rose of Cairo' (although `Hannah and Her Sisters' is quite universal too).  There is something about the way that Mia Farrow's character Cecilia connects so well with the average human being, and the way that her love affair with screen character Tom Baxter feels so genuine even when it is impossible.  I just can't help but feel this wonderful feeling of closure every time I watch this movie (which has only been a few times since I just recently have been turned onto Allen in general).  I just feel such a raw connection to this movie, and I know that many have felt the same connection.

The film takes place in 1930's New Jersey and follows unhappily married Cecilia as she smothers her sorrows by frequenting the local movie theater to watch a film entitled `The Purple Rose of Cairo'.  Cecilia's husband is abusive and unfaithful and her clumsy demeanor has just cost her her job.  Feeling low and worthless she decides to watch `The Purple Rose of Cairo' once again to lift her spirits only to have her world turned upside down when one of the characters, archaeologist Tom Baxter, walks right off the screen into the theater and drags her out the back door.  Tom is everything that Cecilia needs and she him, but their romance is ill fated.  Hollywood is up in arms at the fact that Tom Baxter's all over the country are walking off the screen and the film is suffering since none of the other characters can function without things back to normal.  Cecilia's husband begins to suspect something fishy with regards to his wife's newfound affair and the actor Gil Shepherd, who plays Tom Baxter, is desperately trying to convince his character to return to the film from which he escaped.

The film sounds like frothy fun, and it is fun, but it is also far from frothy.

`The Purple Rose of Cairo' is a very strong character study on the fact that all of us make a difference.  Even a small character in a film is there for a reason and without him the rest of the world ceases to operate.  It also shows the desperation in all of us to break free from the confines of expectation and just be our own person, instead of what the world has conditioned us to be.  Cecilia wants to be like the characters in her favorite movies and Tom wants to be like the average Joe sitting in the seat in front of him.  We all want what we can't have, but in the end have to find that balance that makes us happy.

Woody Allen is a classic director, and the more I watch of his films the more enamored I am by the creative genius that he was (and at times still is).  I have never been a huge follower of directors, always being more of an actor's man than anything else, but recently I've been researching directors and their body of work and I must say that Woody Allen is one of the most impressive.  A lot of people that I know are put off by Allen's style of filmmaking, but what I find most impressive about films like `The Purple Rose of Cairo', `Hannah and Her Sisters' and `Alice' is that they have so much of Allen's style while building themselves into another bracket altogether from his more famed work like `Annie Hall'.  This is without doubt a Woody Allen film, but it is an Allen film that any and everyone can enjoy.",1220572800,,3310,4.39672131147541

355512,4,6301782666,"There's something appealing about those few Woody Allen films in which
he doesn't act, as they give us a chance to catch a glimpse of his
amazing talent from a different angle. The Purple Rose of Cairo is, if
I'm not mistaken, the second time in his career he'd stayed behind the
camera (the previous one was Interiors), and much like he would again
in the 90's with Everyone Says I Love You and Sweet & Lowdown, Woody
has taken the opportunity to examine film and entertainment from a
different angle, and not use the kind of sly dialog and dry humor that
usually character his starring roles.

These films, of course, don't quite have the depth of his earlier, more
personal works - namely and especially, Annie Hall and Manhattan. Nor
is it as daringly original like 1983's underrated masterpiece Zelig.
The Purple Rose of Cairo is closer to it's predecessor of the previous
year, Broadway Danny Rose, and like that film it's, on most levels,
entertainment as pure in form as Woody has ever made. Still, what both
these movies have in abundances is charm and atmosphere, and in my
opinion, Purple Rose is the better of the two. In Purple Rose Allen
revisits his great love-hate relationship with Hollywood, and he
creates a charming ode to Hollywood of the 30's while never neglecting
to point out how naive and out of context it really was. Clearly,
there's no room for a Manhattenite Woody Allen character in there - he
gracefully gives center stage to his spouse and muse Mia Farrow, who
gives one of her most powerful performances in an Allen film. She's
supported by a lovely young Jeff Daniels and a fantastic Danny Aiello,
who both highlight the huge gaps between Hollywood life, small town
life and the movies during the Great Depression.

The Purple Rose of Cairo is neither deep or particularly involving; the
characters and relationships are, for the most part, stereotypical and
symbolic and lack any real intense exploration. What Allen does succeed
in creating in it, and wonderfully so, is atmosphere, an amazing
atmosphere that manages to capture the viewers and transport them. And
so, even if it's neither extremely important nor extremely funny,
Purple Rose is grabbing and entertaining all the way through, and it
manages to blend the comedy, romance and fantasy elements into a
perfectly charming piece of cinema. Purple Rose is a pleasure,
recommended for viewing with a loved one, in a darkened living room, on
a big screen TV, with a big bowl of popcorn.",1187395200,,2481,4.794392523364486

Quite clever.  Rich settings and a high end cast. Well directed by Woody Allen.  Woody does not appear in this film, but if you watch/listen closely, his presence is there vicariously and unmistakably in Farrow's character.

Woody pokes a little fun at the Hollywood elite and tinseltown ""phonyism"", while giving a nod to the working class with their paycheck to paycheck existence and respectable values.

""The Purple Rose..."" is wonderful, is one if Allen's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor, romance and drama, reality and fiction. It is the movie-within-the-movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and Depression Era New York City where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater. The story focuses on Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man (Danny Aiello). Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities. One day, as she watches ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" for the 10th or maybe 15th time, the leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) decides to leave the movie and be with Cecilia in real life. His screen partners are left confused and ""trapped"" in a scene they can't get out of. The live actor who plays Baxter is blamed by the film's producer for his character's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen. Cecilia's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening. On the top of all, Tom Baxters in other theaters try to leave ""Purple Rose of Cairo"", too... It is not the first or last time Allen has played with the concept of the thin line (in this film, the silver screen) that divides film's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet, gentle, sad, technically realized and simply terrific as ""Purple Rose of Cairo"".

355517,5,6301782666,"Woody Allen's The Purple Rose Of Cairo ranks among his better films. The film centers on the experiences of a poor woman named Cecilia who is played wonderfully by Mia Farrow. Cecilia is trapped in a loveless marriage to a brute named Monk who is played by Danny Aiello.

Cecilia has a job as a waitress in a small diner during the depression and although she tries to work hard she can't help but fantasize and chat about the movies with her sister who also works at the same diner. Cecilia's only comfort is in the movie theater watching glamorous but highly contrived movies about rich people who aren't suffering from poverty and the scorn of her husband. Cecilia eventually loses her job and after catching Monk being unfaithful to her she winds up watching The Purple Rose Of Cairo endlessly at the small movie theater in their town.

Imagine Cecilia's surprise when one of the characters, the dashing all-American type guy Tom Baxter, decides to leave the film, jump from the screen into the audience, and run away with Cecilia! Tom represents the purity of heart and the true compassion that Cecilia longs for in her real marriage. She knows Tom is fictional because he came off the movie screen; but Tom maintains he's never going back because he wants to experience the real world with Cecilia as his new bride.

Of course, all of this horrifies the movie theater manager and the Hollywood studio that produced the film entitled The Purple Rose Of Cairo. How inconvenient this is for Gil Shepherd, too, the actor who portrayed Tom Baxter in the film! The movie studio executives and Gil Shepherd hatch a plan to get Tom to return to the movie--but will it work? What would happen if Tom returned to the movie but took Cecilia with him into the land of make believe?

The Purple Rose Of Cairo is a film you cannot afford to miss. Mia Farrow as Cecilia, Danny Aiello as Monk, Cecilia's husband and Jeff Daniels as both Gil and Tom all give some of the most convincing performances I've ever seen. Their performances moved me and engaged my attention much longer than I initially thought they would.

This movie deals with the universal human desire to escape the pain and boredom of everyday life so many of us experience and to replace that misery with a world in which there are no real problems and everyone has money or at the very least a secure job. Cecilia represents us all as she delights to Tom's world of relative innocence and harmony. Therein lies the true strength of this film.

The cinematography shines: I like the scenes in the movie house where you see the film being screened within Woody Allen's picture. The scenes filmed in the amusement park reflect careful forethought concerning lighting and camera angles. The choreography amazes me: I love the scenes in which both the movie theater patrons and the actors in the film are stunned by Tom's decision to leave the movie and they all move about simultaneously in ways that prove good judgment on the part of Woody Allen and his colleagues who worked on this film.

Overall, The Purple Rose Of Cairo will remain an excellent film as long as the human condition and the quality of our lives are imperfect. Everybody dreams of a world where their true desires are reality and their troubles disappear. The Purple Rose Of Cairo elegantly explores this theme with sophistication, wit and poignancy.",1172793600,3,3375,4.700507614213198

355599,5,6301782666,"An absolutely masterpiece, Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" is a great movie that even people who don't usually like Woody Allen might like. I love Woody Allen and out of all of the films I've seen by him (7, I think) this is in my top 3 (below Annie Hall and Manhattan). The movie blends comedy, romance, drama, and features a genuinely sad ending. Allen's baby mama (and wife's mama) Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a Depression-era housewife trapped in an unhappy marriage. She works as a waitress, makes little money, and is clumsy which frequently pisses off her boss. To escape from everything, she goes to the movies. When she sees the newest movie, 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' she falls in love with the character Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels); When Cecilia is finally fired from her job, she sees the movie five times in a row prompting the character Tom to take notice. In doing so, he walks right out of the screen and into the arms of Cecilia. Leaving his fellow characters trapped in the movie and needing him to come back, Tom takes off from the theatre prompting management to call the films producers. When the actor who plays Tom, Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels again) gets wind of it...He fears his career may be in jeopardy and he seeks out Tom, but falls in love with Cecilia in the process. Meanwhile, on screens across America; The Tom Baxters are going haywire, forgetting their lines and trying get out of the movie. It's definitely a strange and original idea that could fail in the wrong hands. Any fan of Allen's should love it, but I did say that non-Allen fans would like it too. Here's why. If you don't like Woody Allen because of his work (a lot of people don't like him because of the Soon-Yi debacle), then it's probably because you don't like the neurotic character that's featured in almost all of his films (and almost always played by him) or you don't look his way of storytelling (the Greek thing in ""Mighty Aphrodite"" or the three endings in ""Sweet and Lowdown""); This film has no neurotic Woody character, straight-forward storytelling. The only way you could even tell it's a Woody Allen movie is from the score and the credit sequences. This is a truly wonderful movie and I highly recommend it.

355600,4,6301782666,"In my humble opinion, Woody Allen is the best movie director that's currently out there practicing the trade.  He says more, amuses more, and creates more on a relatively ""shoestring"" budget than any other director today.  His popularity is apparently rather limited to the point that his movies usually don't even get shown in my town.  Allen's films get praised by a lot of people ""in the know"" but, come Oscar time, about the only award handed out for his productions goes for Best Supporting Actress.  Well, to each his own but I'll recommend every movie he's ever been involved in (with the lone exception of ""What's New Pussycat?""); even the ones I haven't seen yet.

Last night I got my first look at ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" and I ended up rating it ""4 Star"" mainly because I thought it moved along rather awkwardly at times (by Woody Allen standards).  The concept is certainly original; an actor in a movie steps out of the screen and into real life (seems they're watching us as closely as we're watching them).  I started seeing all sorts of possibilities and, I admit, I was disappointed that some of them didn't emerge.  What did emerge was an excellent study of fantasy vs. reality.

The setting for the film was in the midst of the Depression which was a brilliant idea because it gave a readily understood backdrop of gloom and doom.  Anyone would love to escape from such an existance.  Our main character, played by Mia Farrow, finds her escape in the movie theatre.  As the strange events unfold, she finds herself ultimately having to choose between fantasy and reality and we, the audience, find ourselves rooting for one choice or the other.  (Even the exasperated screen characters were cheering sides as well).  In the end she makes her choice and has to live with the consequences...or does she?

I saw this movie on TCM on a night they were celebrating Van Johnson.  I presumed that the ""late"" Mr. Johnson would somehow be shown in one of his old sceen roles.  However, there he was in a fairly small part looking well and doing a credible job.  I learned, from Robert Osborne's introduction to the film, that it's still a little early to call Van Johnson ""late"".  Much of the cast is competent to good with top kudos to Ms. Farrow.  The ending to the movie was strong and I was almost tempted to give it a ""5 Star"" rating but I remembered that I had been significantly more impressed with some other Woody Allen movies I've seen lately.",1156464000,,2466,4.5995423340961095
355601,4,6301782666,"This is a very strong movie, a gem as other reviewers have said.  It is Woody Allen entering the world of fantasy, mixing a very large dose of fantasy in with his reality.  Characters in the movies relate directly with the audience and in one case, walk off the movie screen and into the theatre to mix with the people.  Jeff Daniels of Dumb and Dumber is a small player in a film who walks right off the screen to be with the real life girl he has fallen in love with, Mia Farrow, wife of the loutish Danny Aiello, during the Depression.

Mia is frustratingly weak.  She allows herself to be hit by Danny, to be cheated on and ridiculed.  She is a sponge and a sap who supports a worthless taker of a husband.  When his entreaties and his threats both fail to make her stay with him and continue to support him, he lets her go, knowing she won't last out there alone, knowing she'll return to him in a little while, and he's always right.  So Mia is a frustrating character to root for.  She never wins.

Danny isn't the most realistic character, or at least I don't think he is.  In almost every one of his scenes I am left believing that his words and his behavior are not realistic.  A real man wouldn't talk and act that way.  Of course a real man might cheat on his wife, lie to her, smack her.  I'm not disputing that.  But I think every one of his scenes is poorly written and unrealistically played.  Woody is dabbling, making it up as he goes along, creating a character who doesn't behave as a cheating, lying, brutish man would.  Are you a sensitive enough viewer to pick that up about him and recognize the lack of realism in the lines he is given?  Probably not.  Most people aren't.  But it's there.  If you have an ear for realistic dialogue and motivation, Danny Aiello's scenes will all be jarring.  His quick changes are all artificial, maybe because Woody doesn't have a feel for how a guy like that would really be.  Does the fight scene and its aftermath ring true for you?  If so, you don't have a feel for reality either.  None of Danny's scenes are very good, and it's Woody's fault, not Danny's.

I suppose he could argue that the whole movie is a fantasy, so what am I looking for reality for.  He doesn't really care about realism.  He's just painting, like a French impressionist, so enjoy the ride.  But I prefer some realism in my characters.  Otherwise what's the point.

Still, I was debating between four stars and five, because it is an excellent movie.  The reason I settled on only four isn't the lack of reality in Mia's marriage, but the dud of an ending.  It didn't have to be that way.  Woody didn't have to leave us with a dud ending.  He thinks he did have to, I think he didn't.

Look, Mia, you are too weak and stupid, too chained to your circumstances, to do anything about your marriage or your life, and besides that, we will see to it that you don't catch a break anywhere you turn.  So just live out your futile life and then die a loser and a sap.

Thank you Woody for that excellent view of life on Earth.  For that, I take away one of your stars.

The strongest thing about this movie for me is the way Woody tears away the veil of reality from our present lives.  I happen to agree that this world is a stage set, that there really is another, a more real world, call it Heaven, and that everything here on Earth is a stage prop.  As Macbeth says, we are poor players strutting and fretting our hour upon the stage, and yes, I think this Earth is nothing but a stage to play out our dramas before we return home to reality, to our home in Heaven.  So I like the way Woody strips away the illusion of reality to our lives here on Earth.  I don't think Earth is ""real"", and if you read a modern physics book you will see that our top scientists don't either.  Earth is just the view that we are set up to see, based on what we're made of.  A tiny subatomic particle would pass right through the space between the atoms of the Earth and not even know a planet is here.  And its reality is as ""real"" as ours.",1146096000,2,4058,4.217165149544863

Her husband Monk (Danny Aiello)is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and Cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent. The only escape that Cecilia has is going to the movies--the fantasy world of Hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world. Her favorite movie ""The Purple Rose of Cario"" featuring Gil Shepard (Jeff Daniels) as Tom Baxter (also Jeff Daniels in a dual role)changes her life when the character Tom Baxter walks out of the movie into the real world. He says he's in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except Cecilia's sister cares about. The rest of the characters in the film (Edward Herrman,Milo O'Shea, Deboarh Rush, Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Van Johnson)are pretty upset and end up sparing with the audience watching them on screen when they complain how boring the movie is.

""Purple Rose"" is one of Allen's most complete films and captures all the wistfulness that lurks in the background of his films. This DVD looks extremely good considering that the transfer is from 2001. There's some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly on screen but, on the whole, it's not a big deal. Allen hasn't done commentary tracks are allowed extras on his releases which is too bad as there's cut footage of Viggo Mortensen and Michael Keaton (who was originally cast in the lead instead of Daniels)that would be of interest. I don't know if that footage still exists but if it did it would make a lovely addition to this. Why MGM didn't choose to include archieved footage of Allen talking about the film and new interviews with the stars is beyond me. This Oscar nominated (for Best Screenplay)film certainly deserves a documentary on its making or, at the very least, a featurette. We do get the original theatrical trailer and a booklet that discusses the making of the film.

When the new film ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" opens, Cecilia becomes infatuated with it and its star Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels).

She goes to the film every night, until one night Gil Shepherd (Tom Baxter) stops mid-scene and addresses Cecilia.  She is shocked but more shocked when he steps down from the screen.  Not only does this throw Cecilia for a loop but the movie is stuck at that point and the actors cannot go on.

Gil does not understand that his false world on the screen and the real world are different.  Also, the studio executives are perplexed on what to do.  What happens if this happens elsewhere.  Tom is also worried that this might hurt his career. So he goes to the town to find his alter ego and convince him to return.

This is a wacky romantic comedy and is Allen's most imaginative film ever.  There was no subtext, no hidden messages.

If you want a great original film this is it.  If you do not like Woody Allen films, you will probably like this.

Set during the Depression, Mia Farrow is a waitress who spends her spare time going to the movies. Her favorite is one called The Purple Rose of Cairo, which she sees over and over again. One day the lead male character, Jeff Daniels, begins talking to her in the audience and then steps down off the screen. He is sick of playing his role over and over and wants Farrow to show him the real world. They fall in love, of course, and Hollywood goes crazy and sends the real actor (also Daniels, of course) to persuade him to get back up on the screen again. He falls in  love with Farrow, too, and she must decide what to do - stick by the actor of the film (his film name is Tom Baxter) or the real Daniels. She opts for the real guy only to be dumped by him. (Ah, reality!) It's a clever idea, though it doesn't have many places to go; thus the picture seems somewhat slight.

355702,5,6301782666,"`The Purple Rose of Cairo', written and directed by Woody Allen, is one of those rare movies which is so strongly and imaginatively crafted that it is almost painful to watch a second or third time. While it is certainly not Allen's best, it almost seems like Allen, his actors, and his crew almost flawlessly craft it. Even the fact that Allen does not appear in the film seems to heighten its quality.

While movies (or fiction) in movies play a big role in many of Allen's films such as `Play it again, Sam', `Stardust Memories', and `Deconstructing Harry', this film is unlike those, most especially since this one is not at all biographical. It is most similar to `Zelig' in that the primary premise of the plot has something of a sci-fi twist to it. In addition to the foreground story of the principle characters played by Mia Farrow, Jeff Daniels, and Danny Aiello, there is the comic relief provided by the actors on the screen in the New Jersey theatre who are free to ad lib their time on the screen, since they cannot follow through with the plot with one of the main characters out roaming the streets of New Jersey. One has to thank Allen for this, as without the relief of the figures coming alive on the screen, the movie would be almost unbearably sad.

As Allen's movies are typically done on a small budget and he has a great reputation for bringing projects in on time and within budget, it is a little surprising to see the quality of the filming in this movie. Of course, since the whole premise is based on the contrast between the fictional film and the `real' film, much effort was put into the quality of both. The quality of the `film within a film' is especially well done, as the characters really look like they are from an early 1930's film, except for the very recognizable Edward Herrmann.

And, the acting in the `real' film is even better, as the `fictional' film acting is just a bit over the top. Daniels and Aiello are especially strong throughout the film. Farrow seems just a little too much like her usual `Rosemary's Baby' mousy character until the final scene when she shows a transformation on her face over the course of about two minutes which is so subtle, you may miss it if you were not expecting it. Since you do look for it, the incredibly slow but obvious transformation from sadness to engagement in the Fred Astaire / Ginger Rodgers movie is a tour de force.

This may be one of Allen's most philosophically deep films, which enhances the film's interest without weighing it down so that you can no longer appreciate the story. I can attest to the deep philosophical content with the fact that when I was young, I wondered whether I was `real' or only part of a movie. And, this was at least 25 years before the release of `The Purple Rose of Cairo'. This puzzle led me to take up the study of philosophy in college.

None of Allen's films have any director's commentary, but this is one where I would be most interested in hearing where Allen got some of his inspiration. Then again, there is very little here which is entirely new. Allen is giving us a new treatment of many of his usual themes using many of his usual devices. But, as usual, every time Allen throws all these ingredients into to the mix for a new movie, he seems to come up with a new and engrossing way to bring them all together.

Surprisingly, for a film with a fantasy premise, this work has a lot less humor than the very realistic movies such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors' and `Hannah and Her Sisters'. For that reason, it may be less enjoyable to own, but I think it is easily among the upper half of Allen's films in overall quality.",1116979200,,3664,4.469357249626308

Like so many in blue-collar America, the only solace she can find is in the hey-day productions of RKO with the like of Fred and Ginger and the offbeat serio-comic fluff such as presented in their latest feature, "";The Purple Rose Of Cairo"";.

Allen skillfully brings this premise to bear in a touching and romantic fantasy so unlike his other efforts.

355704,5,6301782666,"""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" is one of those rare films whose concept is intriguing as the end product.  ""Rose"" is witty, thoughtful, masterfully directed and acted, and, for once, we get a chance to enjoy Woody Allen's great talent as a skillful director, without his setting foot on the screen (not even in a cameo--like Alfred Hitchcock did in all of his films).

Cecilia (Mia Farrow), is a waitress at a diner, during a time in the 1920s when the Great Depression has set in, times are tough, jobs are scarce and the people are looking  for an escape.  What better way to seek a diversion than in a movie theatre, where one can live a life of romance, comedy, drama and adventure, vicariously through the larger-than-life actors on the projecting screen?

Cecilia's all-consuming passion for films is her one refuge from the grim life she has built with her abusive, philandering husband (Danny Aiello).  One of her favorite films, by far, is ""The Purple Rose of Cairo.""  When she likes a film she will see it over and over again, almost nightly.  Furthermore, when she isn't in the movie theatre watching the film she knows almost line-for-line, she discusses the plot and the smoldering actors with her co-workers.  Cecilia may have stepped away from the fantasy of the silver screen, once the picture has ended, but it lives on in her heart long afterwards.

One night, when she goes to ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" for the upteenth time, the adventuresome and brawny Tom Baxter, the romantic lead (Jeff Daniels), sees the starstruck Cecilia sitting alone in the theatre, and literally steps off of the screen to be with this mysterious and beautiful woman whose life revolves around films and melding life on screen with life in the day-to-day world.  This has never happened before, and Tom causes quite a stir in the film world, as well as up on screen, because the characters literally cannot leave the scene they were acting in until he returns.  Also, the actor who portrays Tom Baxter is stunned and concerned that his clone, or, rather, his character has taken on a life of his own in the 3-D world!

This film truly has staying power from beginning to end.  It is packed with witty dialogue, clever insight and plenty of warm, over the top humor that is, oftentimes, uproariously funny.  You can tell that Woody Allen wrote and directed this film as a tribute to the films that inspired him--perhaps, to become the great director and screenwriter that he is today.  ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" is truly an underrated masterpiece.",1102118400,7,2540,4.738636363636363

Add a perfectly cast Mia Farrow as a waif-like dreamer of a girl, living in the grinding poverty of the 1930's Depression and married to an blustering, brutal man.  Top it off with a brilliant dual performance by Jeff Daniels who is a cinematic film hero who steps out of the screen and the actor who plays this hooky playing fictional character.
Cecilia (Mia Farrow) works as a waitress (on the verge of being fired).  Her life is grim, living in a tenement with her no-account husband (Danny Aiello).  Her one pleasure is the movies that she attends daily.  Her favorite is ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" and the explorer character ""Tom Baxter"" brings radiance to her eyes that never leave him.  After multiple viewings, one day ""Tom"" falters in his lines, seems distracted, then steps out of the film and joins Cecilia in the audience.  The cast and audience are suitably stunned; the cast enjoining him to get back on the screen so they can finish the movie, and the audience grumbling they didn't pay good money to watch the cast arguing among themselves.  ""Tom"" is resolute, and out they walk, he in his pith helmet and explorer togs, Cecilia radiant.  The movie industry is appalled. They worried about litigation and insurrection if characters start walking off the screen.  Gil Shepard, the actor who played""Tom"" is sent to the scene to talk ""Tom"" into getting back onscreen where he belongs.  ""Tom"" clearly is innocent of what the ""real"" (as opposed to ""reel"") world is about.  He is in love with Cecilia and she allows that he ""is the perfect man.  Of course, he's fictional.""  Real life ""Gil,"" Tom, and Cecilia meet. The ending is surprisingly intense.
Jeff Daniels is dazzling as Gil/Tom. He handles both roles to perfection.  The interaction among Daniels, Farrow, and Aiello is flawless.  Much as I wanted to thoroughly despise Aiello as the low-life husband, he managed to make me laugh and feel sorry for him with his bravado performance.  All the jokes and humor work in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" which isn't the case in many Allen movies.  I believe this is Woody Allen's valentine to his beloved movies.  It couldn't be better.  Even if you are a dedicated Allenophobe, see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.

This obviously causes something of a crisis, as the studio fears more Tom Baxters walking off the screen and commiting crimes, and Gil Shepard (Jeff Daniels again), who plays Tom Baxter, fears for his career.
The DVD is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) and generally looks pretty good. While there are some scratches and grain, the DVD handles the warm autumn colours pretty well.

Suddenly Cecilia is happy, even if Tom is just a fictional character. Meanwhile, Hollywood is in an uproar as other Tom Baxters are threatening to walk out of the picture as well, leaving it to actor Gil Shepherd to try and reign in the character he created.
Some critics dismissed this Woody Allen film as a flip on Buster Keaton's silent classic ""Sherlock Jr.,"" a surreal fantasy about a film projectionist and amateur detective who climbs into a movie. But so what if the idea is not new? The chief charm here is what Allen does with the idea. The romantic triangle between Cecilia, Tom and Gil is pleasant enough, but for me what is hysterical is what is going on back at the theater with the characters in the movie who are waiting to find out what happens. Henry (Edward Herrmann) is worried they will turn off the projector and make everything dark, while Jason (John Wood) insists the movie is really about him so they do not need Tom to come back. Rita (Deborah Rush) points out she is rich and does not have to put up with this nonsense while the maid, Delilah (Annie Joe Edwards) objects to people being in the wrong reel. Of course the time comes for Cecilia to go through the looking glass to join Larry (Van Johnson) and the Countess (Zoe Caldwell) at the swank nightclub, where Kitty Haynes (Karen Akers) is quite upset to find Tom with another woman. The idea that movies are truly ""screen plays"" that the actors play out several times a day is carried off marvelously. Meanwhile, the audiences are staying at the theater to see what happens next. The non-movie is as interesting as the real thing.
Mia Farrow actually has the Woody Allen part in this Woody Allen movie in which Woody Allen does not appear. The accent is a bit much (not as grating as her comic turn in ""Radio Days""), but Cecilia is clearly a sweet soul and there is something about the way the light of the movies plays with her eyes that captures her happiness at finding the escape. Of course, reality, not to mention the Hollywood studio system, are out for money and not happiness, so that there cannot be a storybook ending. ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" is more than a one-joke film, although certainly it is more streamlined that your average Allen film. Besides, despite the enticing impulse to do so, I do not see this as an indictment of Hollywood or the para-social interaction of real audiences with fictional characters. This is a charming little fantasy with enough of an element of reality to keep the dream from staying alive.",1029715200,3,2923,4.601532567049809

Hot Toasty Rag, September 18, 2017

During the Great Depression, a poor, unhappily married woman seeks solace in the movie theaters. Mia Farrow stars as the lead, and shes fantastic and heartbreaking as a woman beaten down by life. She gets scolded at work, and her husband, Danny Aiello, treats her terribly. The only time she feels peace and comfort is when she watches the film The Purple Rose of Cairo. Its magical for her to watch the classic actorsJeff Daniels, Edward Hermann, John Wood, Deborah Rush, and Karen Akersrepeat the adventurous and romantic plot over and over again on the big silver screen.

This isn't my all-time favorite Woody Allen moviethat title is reserved for Hannah and her Sistersbut I always enjoy this hopeful romance whenever I watch it. Im a Mia Farrow fan, and shes just as sweet and likable in this as she is as Hannah. The portion of the film that shows the old movie is totally authentic. Often, actors feel contemporary or as if they're trying too hard, but everyone on the silver screen really seems like a 1930s actor. The extra dose of makeup, the movements, delivery of their lines, and camera angles will make you think it really is an old movie, and the recognizable faces have been photoshopped in!

Theres a surprise in the plot, and if you look it up on Imdb, youll probably read about it. My advice is to just watch it and let the surprise unfold. Many times in Woody Allen movies, his characters find comfort by watching movies. If you identify with that familiar plot point, feel that the best people are often fictional, or ever wished you could interact with movie stars, youll probably love this movie.",1505692800,,1692,4.671140939597316

Well, maybe not THAT surprisingly... it is, after all, a Woody Allen picture. Great cast, clever premise.
