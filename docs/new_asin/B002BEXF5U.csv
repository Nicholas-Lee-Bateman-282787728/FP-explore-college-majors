I also recomend all of his legendry DVD's to the young generation, in order to see what remained to us after the polution!!!",1254268800,9,301,4.592592592592593

3894270,5,B002BEXF5U,"Absolutely excellent! I love the old grainy video and the soft French accented narration.

3894282,4,B002BEXF5U,"Though this documentary is about 20 yr. old, the explorations done by this pioneer in undersea research is still relevant & worth watching. Though I have seen many similar programs, this one is special, in that it gives us a view of how things were, & are no longer (due to global warming). It's like traveling right along with them on their adventures, & seeing amazing animals up close & personal. It is a nice program.",1455667200,,421,4.552631578947368
3894283,5,B002BEXF5U,A must see for any one interested in ocean exploration and Antarctic marine biology with Jacques Cousteau and the crew of the Calypso. One of the first explorations of the world under the Antarctic ice sheets and video of the great bio-diversity that is found there.,1454544000,,266,4.804347826086956

3894286,4,B002BEXF5U,"It's an old documentary but still has lots of interesting information about the Antarctic that I did not know before.  It kept my attention the whole way through, brought back old memories, had me sitting on the edge of my seat during the ice storm, and even made me cry when one of the crew lost his life.  Beautiful, wonderful story.  I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.",1450310400,,370,4.333333333333333
3894287,5,B002BEXF5U,Loved seeing it again.  Watched it as a child on Saturday mornings during the winter.  Danger causes extreme adventure wanderlust.,1447632000,,130,5.45

Oceans Oceans.
You as a light Katrana.

But what there fate?
Here, the corals and currents.
And at the bottom is always excitement.
Evolution itself.

3894307,4,B002BEXF5U,"I'm a fan of the Cousteaus and their work. This amazing voyage into the northern arctic was beautifully filmed, with running commentary by Jacques Cousteau.  It documents the death of his son mid-voyage, which is confusing, since Wikipedia 'reports' he died in Spain.  But the documentary is lovely.  I only faulted some of the older sound track, and the over-dramatization of some of the obvious dangers of ocean travel in snow and ice.",1415923200,,437,4.958904109589041

3894338,5,B002BEXF5U,watched it with my 4 and 6 year old sons who were introduced to Jacques Cousteau through a children's book. they loved watching it. their questions and our conversations were great.,1414454400,,181,4.870967741935484
3894339,5,B002BEXF5U,Picture and sound quality are a little 20th century  in places but this was expected from previous reviews I have read.  Always enjoyed the programs and still an enjoyable watch now.,1412294400,2,182,4.838709677419355
3894340,5,B002BEXF5U,Quintessential underwater adventure. One of Cousteau's finest. Films like these made me want to become an explorer.,1411344000,,115,5.823529411764706

3894343,4,B002BEXF5U,Content was very entertaining but picture quality was not great. The diving scenes were quite impressive and loved the penguins.,1402099200,,128,5.45
3894344,5,B002BEXF5U,I think Amazon would get a lot more ratings if they let you rate without having to type a review. Anyway this is a beautifully photographed movie. I remember seeing it in the theater when I was young. It surpasses most of the cinematography of today. When they are swimming inside the iceberg ; I had to put a sweater on.,1396224000,,321,4.278688524590164
3894345,5,B002BEXF5U,"Great early television documentary.  Plenty of scientific discovery with the everpresent narration of Jacques Cousteau.  Great environmental awareness.  If you are an adventurer, this is for you.",1395187200,,195,6.148148148148148
3894346,5,B002BEXF5U,Highly recommended. One of the most incredible and intense Cousteau films I've ever seen! Great diving footage under a glacier.,1380153600,,127,5.4
3894347,5,B002BEXF5U,"It is hard to find the old Cousteau specials available on DVD.
When I saw this one could be view as a free down load for Amazon Prime I was pleased.
Image wuality was great and the down load delivery work well.",1379980800,2,210,4.023809523809524
3894358,5,B002BEXF5U,"Astonishing and terrifying, but absolutely enthralling.  A+  I wasn't sure what to expect of this, but I will truly never forget having seen it.  Couldn't believe I had never seen it before.  Everyone should see this.",1379030400,,217,4.944444444444445
3894359,5,B002BEXF5U,"Gonna go buy this on Blu Ray. It's an absolute must have for an oceanography, historical, documentary, jacques cousteau fanatic!",1377734400,,128,5.45
3894360,5,B002BEXF5U,"I have seen mostly every Cousteau documentary that was ever produced,being an active sport diver for about 44 years they were my mainstay when I wasn't wet, to view from a professional  group of undersea explorers who loved that world, a place that very few divers would ever get to view. This DVD has been remastered in HD for the Blu-ray format,a top notch video and audio is the end result, taken in ANTARCTICA, one of most inhospitable places on our earth..It was originally produced in 1976 -- 93 min. long . Definitely worth the buck's , 18$ or so,ENJOY!",1372291200,,560,4.6
3894361,5,B002BEXF5U,"During my childhood, our family always watched Jacques Cousteau specials when they were shown on television.  While the footage is now dated, the adventure is not.  Cousteau and crew were poineers, exploring the undersea world, and exploring where others had not yet been.  Besides, who doesn't like a soothing, French accent?  Sadly, though, a crew member and friend was lost on this adventure to the Antarctic, joining others whose lives were lost in the process of visiting that harsh clime.",1367625600,,494,5.1375
3894362,4,B002BEXF5U,"There isn't much subsurface exploring in this film, but it is well done in showing life in the water around the southern continent. The death of crewman Falco as tragic and Cousteau does not shy from telling how it happened. Ironic that son Phillips also died a few years later. Technically, it was interesting to see the audio track was not synchronized to the camera during filming. The soundtrack was synched in post production, no doubt was many sound effects added, although ambient sound is used. Country's visual adventures are missed for their sense of wonder, wisdom and poetry.",1365811200,,587,4.9393939393939394
3894363,5,B002BEXF5U,It is amazing how ahead of his time he was. Even with the outdated technology it was still worth watching.,1365465600,,106,4.35
3894364,5,B002BEXF5U,I think this is my favorite of the three Cousteau film classics.  Perhaps it was the presence of penguins in so many shots.  But they are all enjoyable to watch - I've already viewed each several times.,1364774400,,202,4.4324324324324325
3894365,5,B002BEXF5U,"This is a must see! As always the beautifully done videos are spectacular as I remember from my childhood watching their shows on television. Jacques and Philippe brought me this world that I had never seen before and sparked a curiosity and love of nature because of it. I have appreciated the hard work and perilous dangers they faced in order to explore and obtain the footage. To Jacques and Philippe, et al: Thank you and may you and the Calypso sail gracefully; eternally plying the oceans and exploring new horizons!",1358553600,,523,4.758241758241758
3894366,4,B002BEXF5U,"J Cousteau's exploration films have always been enjoyable, well documented and well presented. In time, I'm sureI will purchase others.",1356307200,4,135,5.8
3894367,5,B002BEXF5U,"We don't see documentaries as raw as this anymore. What I liked about this is that Cousteau really drew you into the story. What separates Cousteau from other documentary directors is he does the best job at identifying you with one or more people in the story. When one of the people in the expedition gets killed you really feel quite sad. Again, I am glad this finally came out in Blu-Ray.",1352246400,3,392,4.458333333333333
8361235,4,B002BEXF5U,It has some strange watermarks that appear and go away sometimes. I love the show.,1526515200,,82,4.533333333333333
8361236,5,B002BEXF5U,Interesting historic material. This is probably how the natural documentary had begun. Jacques Cousteau did a lot for this gender.,1517270400,,130,5.55

8361239,5,B002BEXF5U,superb.  fantastic.  Cousteau was a sort of a unique genius,1498435200,,59,4.8
