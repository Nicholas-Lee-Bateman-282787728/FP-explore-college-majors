5092671,3,B007K7IBTS,"Some pretty good action sequences, kept me watching to the end. This anime has a fairly high production value and feels like a fully developed plot. It won't disappoint.",1348617600,3,169,4.862068965517241
5092672,3,B007K7IBTS,"Let me start off by saying I did enjoy Towanoquon. It was fun. It had action, some mild comedy, and an engaging story. However, my main problem with the show is the feeling of ""been there, done that"". All forms of entertainment borrow from previous works but the whole time i felt like i was was watchint X-MEN: THE JAPANESE VERSION. Overall the story is about ""Attractors"" who are basically mutants. They are people with special abilities. The main character finds newly awaked Attractors and tries to save them before the villians destroy them. He then takes the Attractors/mutants to his Theme park (very reminiscent of Xaviers school for the gifted) and helps the children better understand their abilities and how to use the. Overall the show is fun and not a waste of time. I would never bash the show for being unentertaining just unoriginal. If you are bored and looking for something to watch its not a bad pick up. But if you have a long list of anime you are trying to see you may wanna pass on this one or move it down the line and watch some better shows before this one.",1348099200,7,1084,4.50761421319797
5092673,5,B007K7IBTS,"Basic Overview:
Centuries ago there were many people who had special abilities but as time progressed their numbers became fewer and fewer.  Those people without abilities began to fear those that had abilities.  Over time those with abilities became known as the demons and monsters of the mountains and valleys. As the fear grew in those who lacked abilities they began to hunt down those who were different, reducing their numbers even more.

In a futuristic Tokyo, unique human beings who have awakened distinct powers are being hunted by a secret organization named Custos. Known as ""Attractors"", these exceptional humans are joining forces to defend themselves. They are led by a boy named Quon, an idealist who is determined to save all the Attractors he can.

My Review:
Towanoquon is definitely a must watch anime, it is very engaging, has great character development for the series I've seen recently, and a pretty straight forward type of story telling. The first part of the series will definitely get you hooked but the story tends to speed up a bit and be a little rushed in the last part.  Admittedly the last episode has the best quality of art, the others are all quite good as well, just not as good as the last.  The last episode is a bit rushed, I admit, but I felt it did have a rather satisfying ending, which I haven't seen much of lately in anime series.  Though in retrospect as you watch the series you will notice at the end of a episode/movie there is a tribute to the director at the end of a episode (though I can't remember which one at the moment) as he died of lung cancer, which may have resulted in them ending the series, that could have been longer, before planned.

I've read a lot of places where this has been compared to X-men, and while it is a little like that I think a better comparison for it would probably be Towards the Terra (which the art style reminds of a bit too).  It also could compare a bit to Blassreiter, it reminds me of the people with abilities from Towards the Terra having something like a transformation into something like the demoniacs from Blassreiter (not to mention the cyborgs).  It is most definitely not for kids, there is plenty of blood, gore, violence and a bit of fan service to go around.  I would give the series a 9/10 overall as I enjoyed the story, characters, art and ending.

I would also like to note I watched the dub, though from looking at the Japanese cast I'm sure that track is amazing too, but it wasn't as bad as some I've seen.  I didn't notice any spots where they missed the mark, it was very enjoyable as well.  They seemed to have done a very good job casting as they voices seemed to match the characters very well.  I was rather impressed.

Packaging:
I bought the DVD set (not the blu-ray) which has episodes 1-3 on the first DVD and episodes 4-6 and a commentary for episode 6 on the second DVD from what I remember.",1345766400,11,2918,4.487712665406427
5092674,4,B007K7IBTS,"I saw Towanoquon as I was browsing for new anime to watch.  I threw it on my preorder list and waited for it to get to me.

As far as the packaging goes, this item came in a typical blu-ray case and contained two discs.  The 1st had 4 of the 6 movies on it, while the other had the other 2 movies and some extras.  The extras were just your typical clean opening and endings and some commentary.

The show itself was very enjoyable.  The action was well done and the plot line kept me interested throughout the entire show.  I think the only bad thing I noticed about this show is it reminds me too much of X-men.  It has some originality, but most of the basic concepts are repeated.",1341619200,7,684,4.128787878787879
5092675,4,B007K7IBTS,"""Towanoquon"" is an action-packed anime reminiscent of X-MEN. The main character wants to 'save' all of those with special powers from a secret organization bent of capturing/destroying them. Lots of the characters' powers has been done by (pick a comic book series)~ and this doesn't really take anything away from the series. The fight scenes and animation are AZZ-KICKING and the pacing is just right. The story is also one of it's strongest points. The soundtrack amazing too- as I watched it, I started to wonder whether an OST was available...
  It also has very likeable characters. The only minus this gets from me is the character development. There just wasn't quite enough of it. BUT the series doesn't have a DEFINITE FINAL ending (the 'bad guy' was dealt with but not the 'TRUE bad guys'), although if there wasn't anymore to this, it'd be ok still. I believe it's an ongoing manga so I hope to see more from this one!! Like well-animated action and great storylines? GET IT.",1375833600,3,987,4.8
5092676,4,B007K7IBTS,"I really liked Towanoquon.  There are only 6 episodes, but each is like a mini-movie, I think they're about 40-45 minutes long  It took an idea that had been done in many different anime and made it new and interesting.  The character development was limited to just a few of the main cast, but it worked better for the story that way.  There was a lot of action in this, and the action scenes were drawn/animated very well.  I really wish there was another few episodes after the last one, the story wrapped up nicely, but I feel that they could have done a little more with it.  I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a shorter action series.",1373846400,5,662,4.429752066115703
5092677,4,B007K7IBTS,"It is a lot like the x-men It's a great take on the mutant type of anime it has a great art style and the fighting Scenes in each episode were epic, it's just for me the story fell a little shot I don't know if it was because of the English voice actors or just the story it self but I will watch it again in Japanese later on down the road",1371513600,,340,3.671232876712329

5092681,5,B007K7IBTS,"The show was good and completed itself well, It's nothing amazing but it's definitely worth watching.

The story line it's self was was good but a bit used, that's not a problem but its not the best adaptation of the idea of  mutated people with powers being hunted,Killed,discriminated against and experimented on by an origination. That's acceptable cause the action in the show was amazing in this show that kept your eyes glued to the screen.

The packaging was just a normal blu-ray case with two disc containing all 6 films
Japanese audio subtitles optional to turn on or off
And English dub, which wasn't that bad.",1361923200,2,621,4.785046728971962

5092683,4,B007K7IBTS,"This six part series really isn't that bad. I liked the idea behind it and although I feel it would have helped by a at least 12 episode set up, it caried off the idea of the plot fairly well. Good action and a nice group of characters help it. I just wish they had given a bit more time to character interactions. Overall, not bad.",1354924800,,332,4.045454545454546
5092684,4,B007K7IBTS,"Intense action with every film, the ""Towanoquon"" six-film series is an exciting X-Men-like storyline from BONES.

Directed by Umanosuke Iida (""Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"", ""Hellsing""), written by Toshizo Nemoto (""Tokyo Majin"", ""Getbackers"", ""Chrome Shelled Regios"") and featuring music by world renown Kenji Kawai (""Eden of the East"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Ranma 1/2, ""Mobil Suit Gundam 00) are among the talented crew behind BONES sci-fi film series.

And now the film series will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.

VIDEO:

""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  And because these are films, not a TV series or OVA, I came into watching these films with very high expectations from BONES.  And I'm glad to say, that BONES delivered!

Not only do you get the detailed backgrounds, vibrant colors but also wonderful character designs, awesome use of lighting and visual effects and great balance between CG and cel work. The Blu-ray features vibrant colors, black levels are nice and deep, shadowing is well-done and once again, wonderful detail when it comes to scenery, may it be city landscapes or lush environments.

""Towanoquon"" is a wonderful accomplishment from BONES and awesome picture quality!  I didn't notice any banding or any artifact issues during my viewing of the six films.

AUDIO:

""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  And if I had one word to describe these films, the word would be immersive.  Because of the high level of action seen throughout each of the six films, your surround channels and subwoofer are put into use frequently.

Rarely do you hear anime soundtracks this immersive, so I was impressed.  This is one of the better sounding anime lossless soundtracks on Blu-ray and audiophiles should be pleased!

As for the voice acting, both Japanese and English soundtracks are well-done!  I watched the films with both soundtracks and they are well-acted.  If anything, it's about preference and whichever version you decide on watching, just know that both are equally fantastic when it comes to voice acting and overall soundtrack!

Subtitles are featured in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Episode 6 commentary featuring various time dedicated for the English voice dub actors to talk about their characters and being part of the ""Towanoquon"" which include ADR director Steve Foster, Ty Doran (Yuma), Corey Hartzog (Quon), Elizabeth Bunch (Midori), Andrew Love (Kamishiro), David Matranga (Shun) and Emily Neves (Kiri).
  Trailers - Sentai Filmwork trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Towanoquon"" is an exciting, action-packed anime series that has many similarities to the Marvel Comics series ""X-Men"".  With the storyline of humans being born with special abilities and being hunted, it does resemble the X-Men and the mutants (humans with special abilities) who are being targeted by the government and the Sentinels.

The first three films helps develop the storyline around the Accelerators vs. the Custos and how the Accelerators, or people born with their special abilities, are finding it difficult to deal with their powers and also dealing with their own kind who are very critical of their special abilities.  There are a lot of characters featured in the films, so the first three films focuses on developing the characters, showcasing their personalities and more.

But also how relations are among the accelerators and how difficult a life one lives with their ability.

For example, one episode features a boy who has the ability to talk to plants and can control them.  But he's also bullied by other accelerators who think it's stupid or don't believe he can talk to plants.  And the bullying becomes so bad  that he loses it and wants to show people he can be dangerous and deadly.  But things unfortunately get out of hand.

And in the process, we see how Quon and the Accelerators grow their group but try to make sure people practice their special ability and have control over it.

By the fourth film, things start to get more intense as we get to learn more about Quon's past.  Because he has lived for over a 1,000 years, we get to see how tragic of a life he had lived and why he is so determined to protecting other accelerators.

And then, there is another storyline that involves the character Shun Kazami.  A member of the WTOC and an antagonist in the early films.  But you also learn about his tragic past and what led him to the WTOC.  For Quon, he knows the pain that Shun has lived with and wants to embrace his ability and have him join the group, but because he's from the other side, others are not as welcoming.

While the films are action-packed, violent and has its share of a growing body count, what I found entertaining about ""Towano Quon"" is its characters and how they engage in battle against the WTOC while trying to save other accelerators.  They are literally the hunted and odds are often against them.

The series also looks fantastic!  Featuring anime production by BONES, the character design and visual effects are fantastic.  The studio put a lot of time into making sure the special abilities of the characters are well-featured and lighting effects look amazing. The art backgrounds are gorgeous and full of detail. On Blu-ray, the films look vibrant, full of colors that really pop and a good blend with cel animation and CG.And the lossless soundtrack is equally impressive with LFE and the use of surrounds during those many action sequences to make ""Towanoquon"" quite immersive!  I do wish there were more special features aside from the one single commentary but at least a special feature was included.

While the storyline is nothing new and fans who grew up reading or watching ""X-Men"" will find many similarities between the the well-known Marvel series and ""Towanoquon"", the main difference would be cultural sensibilities.  Because Quon has pretty much grown up during traditional Japanese times and his immortal status has taken him to Japan of the future, there is a good blend of traditional Japan and futuristic Japan featured throughout these episodes.

The characters and their abilities are well-presented and thanks to the visual effects, lighting effects and beautiful animation and background art combined with an exciting storyline.

An action-packed series with a heavy hitting storyline, beautiful animation and an immersive lossless soundtrack on Blu-ray, ""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" is highly recommended!",1354147200,3,6642,5.140726933830382
8518823,5,B007K7IBTS,"The movie arrived in great condition and earlier than expected. It was package nicely.

Whenever I buy a movie thats not produce in the USA Im always worried about the quality and English subtitles. Is it high definition? Does the subtitles make sense? Is there any miss spell words, etc. However Towa No Quon does not disappoint. Video quality is great. Subtitles is accurate and there is no miss spell word or phrase. Lots of time when I watch anime I cant stand it if subtitles are off, makes no sense, or lots of miss spell words. As Ive stated earlier it was easy to follow the anime and understand the plot.

8518830,5,B007K7IBTS,"Towanoquon has a simple, yet elegant, plot - to save and teach those with special abilities. Of course, it is never that simple. The plot is pretty in-depth with action, hand to hand combat, sword wielding, special ability fighters. There is a smidge of romance in the story but I didn't mind.",1392768000,,293,4.653846153846154
8518831,3,B007K7IBTS,"I looked at reviews and watched a clip online before buying. The reviews were either glowing with no gripes (which isn't the best indicator of real quality), or the gripes that were voiced had to do with the storyline being borrowed from X-Men, which I was sure I could get past (or so I thought).

***PROS***

ANIMATION
Very fluid, like they had a feature-film budget. The opening scene is mind-blowing. (This was the clip I came across on the net and bought the series with the quickness after viewing.) The fighting choreography is fast-paced and inventive. The powers the characters possess are not original by any means, but the choreography employs them in a graceful and effective way.

MUSIC
While not abundant in variety, the music is powerful and driving. It helps the show reach for epic.

That is all.

***CONS***

STORY
It's X-Men. There are kids with special abilities. The mean old authorities have it out for them. The main character owns a secret refuge where they can learn to control their powers and dodge prejudice. The episodes are only six in number, but each is longer than the norm. As a result, the narrative drags to a crawl. The storyline is two-dimensional and for kids. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if this is for children, then why the stellar animation and blood? Blood and gore are abundant, but the adult nature of the action seems out of place for a story that is open and shut, basic.

CHARACTERS
These characters are pieced together from successful animes and formulas, and delivered unsuccessfully. *SPOILER - BUT NOT REALLY* When a cool bad guy with white hair and an attitude shows up, you know he's going to be part of the good team (Vegeta/Green Ranger syndrome). The good guy (Quan) has a past: He was brutal, but now he's nice and wears a girl's hair band so, okay. He also can't be killed (ingenious) and takes tons of damage hoping the audience feels for him. He'll heal. Who cares? There's a cool girl who cares but doesn't let people get too close. There's a kid with a beanie who pretends everything is lame but has the biggest heart of all. All the other kids with abilities cry ""They don't understand me!"" while causing a ruckus until Quan shows up to say ""We're in this together.""  Then they stop and smile. The finales are a jumble of fantastic action sequences and floating, nude characters touching fingers in a blinding limbo to attain POWER THAT CAN'T BE BEAT! I've seen it too much.

In summation, this show has some noteworthy battles and beautiful animation, but the storyline demands patience while offering nothing new. I will say that kids haven't seen everything under the sun yet and might enjoy it. Fans of art, choreography, and animation quality are invited to watch it through once to admire some masters at work, but don't stay for the story; it falls victim to repetitive mediocrity fast. It just doesn't hold up well with all the good stuff out there, and that's a shame.

I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",1380153600,2,3131,4.676363636363637
