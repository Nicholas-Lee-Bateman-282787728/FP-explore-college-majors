8387163,5,B0031OAL9C,"Being a Baby Boomer and a little kid in the fifties I loved reading Blackhawk comic books. I also loved the serials from the thirties and forties that would be shown in bits and pieces at the end of the five o'clock movie broadcast from Boston. As an adult living in Southern California there was a video store that I frequented and they had tons of serials on VHS. I was in seventh heaven. With the advent of DVD , Blu-Ray & Amazon, a huge section of my movie library contains tons of serials. You can just imagine how thrilled I was to learn that not only was the Black Hawk comic book turned into a serial but was also available on DVD. Of course I bought a copy and I have not been disappointed . If you love serials and remember Black Hawk comic books from when you were a kid I highly recommend that you buy a copy of this serial and settle in for a good old fashioned rip roaring time.",1501804800,,892,4.132183908045977
8387164,5,B0031OAL9C,"At About the same time that the comic books ""Blackhawks"" were being published, along came the Chapter Play Cliffhanger.  Ok, It is not as good as I remembered it, but still, in retrospect, a lot of fun.  This is a good, clear copy, packaged well and delivered as advertised.  The star, Kirk Alyn, became famous as ""Dick Tracy"" in many other movies and serials.",1366761600,2,360,4.59375

8387166,3,B0031OAL9C,"I read my first Blackhawks comic book in 1947, and as a child I was impressed.  Lately I have started researching the Blackhawks to refresh my memory.  This DVD is a set of serials.  It is entertaining to my wife and I but several liberties have been taken with the Blackhawks.  In this series they are crime fighters who carry no weapons, so there are a lot of fistfights with guys who have been shooting at them.  Its low budget but entertaining, and brings back the experience of seeing serials with the movies.  The vendor provided quick service and the condition was as stated.",1318204800,3,582,4.548076923076923
8387167,5,B0031OAL9C,"Bringing comic book heroes from the 40's and 50's this was an unexpected treasure. This is state of the art 1950 type stuff. A bit campy for some, but loads of fun for my family! If you are in to detail and color and expect blood gore and guts this is not for you. Its entertainment and for the whole family.",1314662400,3,308,4.065573770491803
