7895863,3,6305793972,"Hwang Jang Lee and Philip Kao Fei Lap in a movie together. You know it must be good right? Well kinda sorta.
This movies plot was based on a rich woman who's dog has been stolen. She goads her  husband into having the police find the dog and when the theif is caught he is to be beaten and thrown into jail. However, the police chief, Hwang is a very shady character. He uses this excuse to roust all of the locals. Enter Philip Kao. He is one of the locals that can not stand for all of the police brutality. To make a long story short. Hwang and Kao end up in the final confrontation, which by far has to be one of the most explosive and violent fight scenes ever filmed. The sad thing is is that this one fight can not make up for the lack of action or storyline in this film. If you're a fan of Hwang and Kao get  it as you should have this in your collection. By the way do not get annoyed by the  ridiculous voice they used to dub over Hwangs. I liked it enough.",984009600,,968,3.953846153846154

Once again Hwang Jang Lee is the villian, But it only adds to his amazing martial arts skills.  Phillip Kao is also mesmorizing in a class act performance.  One of the more confrontational final duels ive witnessed, and massive replay value.  May not be a popular movie to many, but a definate must see!",969753600,,406,4.597222222222222
