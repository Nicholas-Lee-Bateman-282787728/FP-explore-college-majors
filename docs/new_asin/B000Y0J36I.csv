Follow the instructions and play it as intended, learning and repeating the vocabulary along with your child. As a language teacher of 4 languages, I highly recommend this series. My infant/toddler uses it.",1333411200,,286,4.979166666666667
8230474,1,B000Y0J36I,"Maybe if your child already knows French this might work, but not for my kids. My kids are 2 1/2 and 7 1/2 and do not watch a lot of tv or movies so when they are allowed to watch something they sit glued to the tv.  This held their attention for about 3 minutes and my 7 1/2 year old asked me what the heck was going on with this thing. I told them to be patient and watch but it really did not make any sense to me either. Definitely one to skip, sorry Little Pim.",1299888000,,466,3.7551020408163267
8230475,5,B000Y0J36I,"My grandson just turned two.  My daughter strictly limited his exposure to TV during his first year and he has showed little interest in watching any shows, preferring books and playtime.  However, since my daughter is well traveled and wants to expose him to other languages and cultures, she bought Little Pim in French.  Something about this DVD really sparked his interest and he began going over to the DVD player, asking to see the panda! Now both he and my daughter are learning some French vocabularly together and he is having fun watching the kids and babies on screen.
I am excited to buy him the other other DVDs in the series for the holidays.  Thank you for the delightful music, the cute panda and the vocabularly....it all works so well together.  I would rate this a 5+.
