good show on the band's behalf. if you aren't too familiar with the band just know they are obsessed with horror. their stage show involves some small gwar like acts. this clearly is a great setlist for any fan of necrophagia. however the sound quality lacks a little bit, one of the guitars and the bass is wayyy to quiet and loses the vibe at times. similarly killjoy seems to lose his timing on some of the songs. worst of all, the crowd hardly seems like they are enjoying themselves at the show which is kind of a bummer cuz this would be a sweet show to be at.

dvd also includes sickness, a mockumentary/homemade horror movie of the band on tour. and also a couple extras like the soundcheck and instore signing are on it. buy it online or if you are lucky enough to find it in a store (which i did) pick it up, you will not regret it if you love necrophagia",1199145600,4,1223,4.60091743119266
