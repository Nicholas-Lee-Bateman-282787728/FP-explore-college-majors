8245661,1,B0012EI89S,"They attmepted to put too much information into a single recording. Also, for a documentary it was much too wordy with few photos and film strips. I will not be purchasing any more of this series.",1307404800,2,196,4.472222222222222
8245662,4,B0012EI89S,"I bought this together with Battlefield: Air War Over Germany which I had some very harsh words to say about. So my expectations were quite low when I began watching. However I was very pleasantly surprised. It's possibly not the very best telling of the battle of the Atlantic, but it's engaging, informative and generally well made. Most importantly, it avoids the pathos that the other title wallows in. If you're interested in the battle of the Atlantic I would say this is well worth a watch. Not bad at all.",1286323200,7,513,4.648351648351649
