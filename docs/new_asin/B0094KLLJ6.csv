If, on the other hand, you prefer truth, logic, and facts to ridiculous conspiracy theories, you won't want to waste your time on this tripe.

I just wish I could give this DVD 0 stars, because it doesn't deserve the one required to write this review.

Just look at the other garbage put out by the person who made this DVD. Seriously. Click on the name ""Pastor Mike Hoggard (Actor),"" and you'll see what sort of snake oil this presumptuous 'pastor' peddles.

It would be hilarious if it weren't so sad.

If you value your reputation and dignity, don't waste your time and resources on this, and if you made the mistake of so doing previously, well, you probably won't want to admit to it.

And to be clear, I attended the 'Restoring Honor' event at the Lincoln Memorial with my firstborn son, on 8/28/2010, that is pictured on the DVD's 'artwork.' The event pictured on the DVD has nothing to do with the ""Divine Destiny Rally,"" which was wasn't a rally at all, but rather an inspirational patriotic meeting at the 2,454-seat Concert Hall in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, on the previous evening. Pastor Hoggard's description is riddled with inaccuracies.

I had never heard of Pastor Mike Hoggard before he released this DVD. I wish I could get the time back wasted on this, and that I had never heard of Pastor Hoggard. This DVD is an insult to the entire human race.",1381449600,2,1498,4.630188679245283
8535991,4,B0094KLLJ6,"I was watching this DVD and Pastor Mike Hoggard words very intensive.
I've to mention that I like Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin with their message against
transforming America and our founding fathers.
But there is some more in Pastor Hoggard's message, and it made me curious.
I also learned some more facts regarding the Mormon church, what I didn't know before.

I would suggest this DVD product for an intensive listen and understand for every
American. Than it is up to every individual to make their choice where to stand,
where to go in their religious believes.

Be sure to do alot of research on both sides on the Internet.",1364083200,,629,4.657657657657658
