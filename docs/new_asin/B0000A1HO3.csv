1900813,5,B0000A1HO3,"DL Hughley is a comical genius.
He has the timing of one of those expensive grandfather clocks or a rolex.
Impeccable , and worth listening to on repeat, even after i'm dead i'm gonna have some 22 inch speakers on either side of my grave to play DL Hughley.

Aint no thang a but a chicken wang.",1267056000,,294,4.157894736842105
1900814,4,B0000A1HO3,"I have never been a great fan of DL, and so it was with great trepidation that I sat down to watch this one, but he certainly brings on the laughs in this performance. I went and bought a copy immediately after viewing it for the first time. Each time I watch it, it is funnier than the last. He is outrageously hilarious. His side-splitting commentary on the US invasion of Afghanistan is par excellence. The only reason I have marked him down is that there a few jokes that are off the mark. It is a must-have in any serious collection of stand-up.",1225843200,,550,4.298076923076923
1900815,3,B0000A1HO3,"This ""Platinum Comedy Series : D.L. Hughley"" is really not that special if you own the original (ASIN : B0000A1HO3). It is the exact same dvd with a new cover. I was hoping for a ""Deluxe edition"" with a bonus cd. That would have made this worth re-getting. This special was halarious.",1190851200,3,284,4.480769230769231
1900816,3,B0000A1HO3,"Let me start by making sure that you know I laughed extremely hard about six times during this hour-long live set. Hughley addresses a lot of the same topics that Chris Rock does during his sets (men vs. women, white people and black people, growing up poor) but his material does not hit as hard and is not quite as understandable. The first half hour is great, but the second half runs dry. This set is very good, but if you're looking for the cream of the crop, go straight to the stand-up of Chris Rock. This DVD was the first time I ever experienced anything Hughley related-I've never seen his TV show-so maybe that had something to do with it. Overall I'd say this is a very solid rental at Blockbuster.",1093737600,5,710,4.386363636363637
1900817,5,B0000A1HO3,"This DVD has to be one of the best stand up performances I have ever seen. I also checked out Cedric The Entertainer's Starting Line Up,and this is better! D.L. Hughley is one of the best comics on the scene today. This DVD proves that. The only drawback to this DVD is that it has to be the most vulgar stand up routine I have ever seen. So if you have young children,DO NOT let them watch this. I'm signing off for now. In the mean time,check out the rest of the Platinum Comedy Series,includingStarting Line Up 2,which comes out October 21st. Also watch some reruns of ""The Hughleys"",I guarantee that you will like it.",1064534400,5,621,4.408695652173913
1900818,4,B0000A1HO3,This is another DL banger. I have been a fan of DL since his Going Home special. This guy is funny. He's all over TV doing a lot of big things. Comedy fans should definetly check tihs joint.,1060041600,4,190,4.026315789473684

7995379,3,B0000A1HO3,"While this is the only D.L. Hughley stand-up DVD we've seen, we have enjoyed him in several TV appearances, and also a fantastic live set at a comedy club in the last year.

D.L. is a great talent but this is not his best work. He seems to try to force in unnecessary extra profanity, and while there are a number of good jokes, it misses some of the fine-tuning and great wit & insight behind other D.L. comedy. That said, if you have already watched his other stuff, this is certainly still worth checking out. Because on an average day, D.L. matches many comics on their best day!",1341100800,,583,4.348623853211009
