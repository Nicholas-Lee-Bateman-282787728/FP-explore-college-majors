7924887,4,B00004W5UP,"This Best of Tromadance Volume I is great, but the shining star is Red's Breakfast II.  Gore, blood, mayhem, and an amazing love story... how could you beat that?  It so perverse, and yet so titilating.
Word on the streets is their filming a feature.  Can't wait!

7924889,4,B00004W5UP,"I love this tape. The character of Red is an man after my own heart. He is non only demented but he is an hopeless romance. Him tender scene with Violet satisfy my need at saw an roamantic cinema presentation,  while him cannibalistic side satisfy my thirst for film from gore. It is my willpower that yonder be several sequels at Red series. Perhaps film distributors voin want release the film with Romanian subtitles so all citizen from my earth want enjoy.",987465600,,460,4.609756097560975
7924890,4,B00004W5UP,"This movie tape is one of the best ever I have seen. not like movies I in Czech Republic not at all.  Zitlover is grosse like Toxic Revenger with boils all over. Very funny. Harry Knuckles also funny fighting dusty mummy and the girl who gets spanked is beautiful when she talks Spanish all fast. but the touchingest and most bizarre perhaps is the story of Red's Breakfast. Red is a killer but he is adoring and nice even when he saws off legs of a friend. The friend, who works for Jerry's Architecture Firm, doesn't seem to mind at all because Red is such a great guy. Then Red goes in love with Violet and it is so nice. This movie will make people happy and feel nice-hearted. For these three movies the movie cassette tape is well worth the cost you pay it. Most especially for Red's Breakfast, which is so great.",982972800,2,819,4.318181818181818

7924892,4,B00004W5UP,"WELL I AM NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS TAPE BECAUSE SOME OF IT IS SWEET AND SOME OF IT IS CRUMMY. LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. EVERYTHING ONO IT IS TERRIBLE EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE REALLY WIERD MOVIE ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER NAMED RED. EVEN THAT ONE IS NOT SO GOOD TO BE TOTALY HONEST BUT IT IS JUST SO BIXARRE THAT IN A WAY IT BECOMES AMAZING. I MEAN IT IS ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER WHO FALLS IN LOVE AND SO THIS WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE PERVADES EVERYTHING, EVEN WHEN HE KILLS PEOPLE THEY ARE REALLY HAPPY TO BE KILLED BECUASE THE ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE IS EVERYWHERE. IN MY BOOK THAT IS PRETTY WIERD. ALSO THE MOVIE IS PRETTY FUNNY ALTHOUH NOT AS FUNNY AS IT THINKS IT IS, WHICH IS DEFINITELY TRUE OF THE OTHER MOVIES ON THIS TAPE. SO ALL IN ALL IT ONLY GETS FOUR STARS OUT OF FIVE.",979171200,4,776,3.949044585987261
7924893,4,B00004W5UP,"Troma's ""Best of Tromadance"" video is fantastic: A collection of 5 short films from Troma's annual fil m festival in Park City, Utah. All films are worth watching, but ""Red's Breakfast II : Dawn of the Red"" and ""Zitlover"" are standouts. ""Red's Breakfast II"" reminds me of what made all of the early John Waters films great. Dirty,grainy and raw visuals, with charming yet subversive dialog and subject matter. Hilarious. ""zitlover"" is a gross-out short that definately belongs with Troma. I recomend this video to anyone who wants something...""different"".",979171200,,555,5.247191011235955
