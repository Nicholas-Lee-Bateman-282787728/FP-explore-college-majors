8204950,1,B000SAJC7E,"Out of all the wonderful things in Wamego, Kansas to make a documentary about, they picked the one thing Wamego would like to forget. Making sure that I keep this review about ""Wamego Strikes Back"" and not the other abominations the Baldersons have produced, this ""documentary"" seems very scripted and over-dramatized. The composition is not ""terrible"" but not great either. If you haven't seen any of Steve Balderson's films, you could find yourself being caught up in this documentary thinking what a shame it is that Hollywood never picked up any of his movies. I would tell you to go watch ""Firecraker"" or ""Pep-Squad"" so you can understand why investors dropped his films, but I would never want to inflict that type of torture on another human being. The Baldersons can't write, can't direct and can't produce. Steve's new stuff is even worse than his old. If you receive any of Steve Balderson's films, throw them in the trash because that is exactly where they belong.",1311638400,,975,4.879518072289157
8204951,5,B000SAJC7E,"This is a brilliant documentary of the trials and trials behind the release of the excellent 'Firecracker'.

Steve and Clark Balderson are an absolute inspiration to watch. The belief they have in themselves and their ability to recognise the Hollywood crap in an instant is remarkable.

With their hearts on their sleeve, these men are dedicated to achieving their vision in their way. Nobody knows their film better than they do. So why the heck should anybody else dictate how their film should be released?",1184112000,7,510,4.988235294117647
