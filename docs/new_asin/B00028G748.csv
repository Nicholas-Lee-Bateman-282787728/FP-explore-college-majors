2067394,5,B00028G748,First of all I would like to apologise for the bad pun but I couldn't help myself!! I don't own this set but I am a huge fan of the show.,1131408000,8,137,3.4516129032258065
2067395,3,B00028G748,"Many old classics released on DVD today are minus the original theme songs.  My husband use to duplicate videos for a living.  He said he thought the theme songs were missing because they were under a copyright licence.  The shows themselves are possibly public domain which means they can be reproduced for little or nothing, but the songs are under a different licence. That means they would have to be paid for, or maybe the owner would have to be paid a royalty.  This way anyone with a duplicating business can duplicate these classic, replace the theme songs and still make money.",1130371200,,586,4.715686274509804
2067396,5,B00028G748,"I first started watching The Dick van Dyke Show in the mid to late 1960's when it was already in syndication.  My brother and I used to rush into the house during summer vacations, stopping whatever game we might be playing, to watch the show at 11:00 (or was it 11:30) AM.  In the 80's with the first video recorders. I began taping each episode when they started running on Nick at Night.  The shows were still unbelievably fresh and funny.  Now, my brother has the episodes on DVD, and I am happy to say, his son (12 yrs old) loves this show, too.  It is timeless because it is simply the best TV show ever.",1129248000,6,610,4.224137931034483
2067397,5,B00028G748,"I grew up with this show, have enjoyed it in reruns, actually taped every episode and was delighted when it came out on DVD.  It is a timeless program for all ages. I love it!",1128902400,2,175,4.0
2067398,5,B00028G748,What great writing and what a cast. There were a few clinker episodes in the series ( just as in I Love lucy) but does the writing hold up. And the supporting cast was perfect. I could watch them hundreds of times.,1125705600,3,214,4.119047619047619
2067399,5,B00028G748,"Watching episode after episode of unadulterated half-hour TV genious-- the writing, the talent of the lead and his supporting cast-- transports me to the mythical past of this nation when it could have been great if it had been more Van Dykian in its approach to the world and its myriad peoples.  Funny, sparkling, humane, certain but not overbearing, innovative, energetic, polished without contempt, idealistic, and no where near perfect.  What a great series.",1124755200,6,463,5.243243243243243
2067400,5,B00028G748,"... what the Beatles were to pop music!  Already available on DVD as separate seasons, this boxed set puts the entire 158 episodes under one roof.  It's no exaggeration to state that THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW came as close to perfection as situation comedies could be.  Any way that you want to look at it, this show was state-of-the-art!  The cast was brilliant without exception, from the Petrie family (Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Larry Mathews) to Rob's co-workers (Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, Richard Deacon), their neighbors, and a who's-who of guest stars (Don Rickles, Greg Morris, Jerry Van Dyke, etc.) who contributed to the humor without upstaging the regulars.

Not to mention Carl Reiner, who not only was effective on-screen but very creative behind-the-scenes.  He merely invented the show, for one.  In fact, another ingredient that places the show on a pedestal is the quality of the writing.  Amazingly, there is a consistency over the thirty-plus episodes (multiplied by five years) that makes me hard-pressed to think of even one subpar show in this series (""The Twizzle,"" maybe?).  Sure, some shows stand out: the walnut episode, Alan Brady's wig disclosure by Laura, the ""wrong baby"" episode, and so on.  Yet every show is a delight to watch again and again.  The humor is genuinely witty and most of the topics are still relevant even today.  In fact, I sometimes think that watching the way Rob and Laura realistically dealt with a wide range of human emotions (jealousy, etc.) and marital situations (misunderstandings, etc.) was probably an effective early form of marital counseling for many viewers.

Yes, the show is of its time: you'll find yourself dropped right in the center of the early-1960s, right on the brink of changing attitudes regarding gender, race, marriage, etc.  Rob and Laura slept in separate beds?  Yeah, right.  Not to mention Laura wore the capri pants in the family.  Yet the show's overall vision elevated it to timeless status.  The series' style may be dated to the era in which it was created, but the substance remains relevant and laugh-at-loud funny even four decades after their original broadcasts.  Other reviewers have remarked on all of the DVD extras, great video quality, etc.  All of that is important, but the bottom line is the greatness of the show itself.  It seems as if every t.v. show that ever existed is being reissued on DVD, moreso than anyone could possibly have time to watch.  You'll want to make time for THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW, though!",1113696000,123,2516,4.912322274881516
2067401,5,B00028G748,"If you're looking for a super-sensational, tantalizingly-terrific, and spectacularly-massive DVD set containing some of the greatest comedy moments in TV history, then look no further than this colossal 25-Disc DVD set containing every last episode of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", the multiple Emmy Award-winning CBS-TV comedy series which ran from 1961 to 1966.

This Complete-Series mega DVD collection houses all five seasons of the very funny and perpetually-entertaining Van Dyke Show, encompassing 158 total episodes, all restored and remastered by Image Entertainment and Paul Brownstein Productions, with each episode exhibiting darn-near perfect video and audio quality. And every single episode is complete and unedited. Not a single second of any show has been cut out. Average running time per episode is a shade more than 25 minutes.

All 158 shows have been bundled together here to form one gigantic and money-saving 'Complete-Series' collection. Each of the twenty-five discs gets its own individual ""ThinPak"" (slimline) plastic case. Each case has unique and nicely-designed cover art (featuring a different publicity still photograph on every one of the 25 cases). Additional photos grace the back cover of each case, as well as more Van Dyke Show pictures (and a complete ""Scene Selections"" list for each of that platter's 6 or 7 episodes) on the inside of every case. (These plastic cases are the ""clear"" type, so you can read the ""Scene"" listing on the inside front covers right through the plastic.)

The back of each of these slim cases provides quick at-your-fingertips info about each show on that disc -- such as: Full episode titles; Film dates; Original CBS-TV air dates; Brief episode descriptions; Plus some crew credits (""Written by"" and ""Directed by"" notations). The 158 episodes are arranged here by ""Production"" (or ""Film Date"") order, instead of an ""Air Date"" chronology.*

* = With one (very wise) exception being Episodes 157 and 158. ""The Gunslinger"" was actually the last (158th) Van Dyke episode to be filmed; with ""The Last Chapter"" being the final episode that was aired, in June 1966. So, for proper continuity sake, Image Entertainment has flipped the order of these two episodes on the last disc of Season #5 -- with ""The Last Chapter"" being presented as the final show of the series.

More Packaging Notes -- The 25 individually-cased discs in this Mega-Set are placed side-by-side inside a large outer ""slipcase"" box.

Image Entertainment distributed five separate season-by-season ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" DVD boxed sets in 2003 and 2004, with each of those five sets featuring a 5-Disc slipcase box. However, those individual seasonal slipcases from each of the previously-released Van Dyke seasons are NOT included in this Mega-Set.

Many, many supplemental bonus features are also included on these twenty-five Digital Discs, including: Audio Commentary tracks for many episodes, along with cast interviews, original TV commercials, Emmy Award snippets, documentaries, featurettes, photo galleries, behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage, Easter Eggs, trivia games, CBS-TV promos, and gobs of other little interesting extra tidbits besides! A 12-page booklet, packed with interesting info about the series, is also a part of this Dick Van Dyke Show bonanza too.

There are even full-length TV-show bonuses included on selected discs, including a complete episode of ""The Danny Thomas Show"" (which has Van Dyke Show character ""Buddy Sorrell"" popping up).

Other complete TV-show extras include the original ""Pilot"" episode for ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (called ""Head Of The Family""); plus a full-length 46-minute CBS-TV documentary made in the mid-1990s (""The Dick Van Dyke Show Remembered""); and an absolutely-outstanding and ultra-fun-to-watch TV game show entitled ""Stump The Stars"" (aka: ""Mike Stokey's Pantomime Quiz""), which has several Van Dyke Show cast members playing a lively charades game. Great, great fun!

If you want to know the full details regarding each and every little bonus extra you can expect to find on these 25 discs, you can seek out my extensive reviews for each of the separate Van Dyke Show boxed sets here at Amazon.com. If you type in ""VAN DYKE SHOW SEASON"" while searching under ""DVDs"" here at Amazon, you'll get a convenient and handy search result that places links to all five of the Van Dyke seasonal sets on just one webpage for easy reference.

Pull out any one of these 25 discs and you'll have some great shows, including all of Rob Petrie's inimitable physical comedy bits -- not to mention Dick Van Dyke's unsurpassed ability to act out a ""one-way telephone conversation"" (which always amazes me when I see him do this -- and there are many such ""telephone"" moments during the series). Then, too, via this amazing boxed set, you'll also get every one of Laura Petrie's (Mary Tyler Moore) ""crying jags"", plus all the standout ""Rob & Laura dancing and singing"" scenes. And don't forget about all those ""Buddy insults Mel"" gags (which must number in the hundreds over the course of the series).

Just suffice it to say that I love this television program. .... Its humor is timeless. The characters seem ""real"" and ""non-phony"". And the writing is remarkable. And you'll be able to see why when you pop in any of these wonderfully-restored Digital Versatile Discs.

""THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW: THE COMPLETE SERIES"" DVD collection is, without fear of argument, a ""complete treasure"".",1109635200,497,5457,5.215753424657534

There were 2 special diversions that were fun  - 1) sometimes there were flashbacks to when Rob (who was in the army) and Laura (who was in the USO) met, dated, and married, and 2) sometimes there were occasions, for example, at parties, when everyone would showcase a talent - a variety show built into the series framework.

(Pressing ""menu"" will get to the menus, but any attempt to leave the menus freezes it again.)

They can make the picture quality HD, but they can't expand the format for the episodes? I tried changing the settings, but to no avail.

It was a blind-buy for me. I can see a lot of Dick Van Dyke in Jim Carrey. He seemed to be completely boneless too. It's a family-oriented show with loads of laughs and a big heart.
The picture quality is nearly perfect. Some episodes have a bit more damage, which is never really distracting, and some of the fade-ins and outs suffer from macroblocking, but it's no biggie. Overall, it looks sensational.
The sound is OK, but certainly nothing to write home about.
No subtitles is a bummer, but not the end of the world, since the dialogue is almost always intelligible.
Special features aren't that great either, but there are some interesting bits.

The black and white is crisp and clear and the sound is just as excellent.  There were a couple of episodes early on where the sound sort of waxed and waned but only for a few seconds.  The extra bonus features are just enough and gratefully short to not be intrusive and they were interesting to listen to.  There are several short interviews with the, at that time, still living actors and also short shots of the Emmy award shows during their wins.

But, I think it was because of the position of the actors at the time and the boom mike not being able to keep up/get the right angle to capture the sound fully. After seeing the bonus clip of the Color Test for the Walnut Episode, it makes me wonder if they filmed ALL of the episodes in Color (you can tell that this isn't ""colorized"" and is the exact same footage as the black and white version) and if so, would they be able to put THOSE on Blu-Ray?!?! It was SO cool to see what everything/everyone looked like in color back then. Man, would THAT be a treat! If it's on Color-Stock film, then, there should be a way to do it.

Well the tv censors may have forced them to have separate beds but you just knew only one of them was being used every night when the lights went out. The Petrie's were definitely not the Cleaver's. For it's time, this was groundbreaking tv. I mean heaven forbid... a woman in PANTS!!! It's the end of the world!

Not so much. The end of the world turned into one of the best comedy series of all time. To this day I still haven't seen a cast that comes close to the talent that was on this show. Acting, singing, dancing. They had it all.

Eleven years ago I wrote a glowing review of the first DVD release of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show.""  At that time it was a thrill to have the episodes restored, complete and remastered (and with great extras).

Well -- technology has been busy the past decade and here we are again.  The same episodes, many of the same extras, but WOW.

This Blu-ray release is the closest we'll get to actually being in the studio audience during the filming of the show.  The picture quality really is that good, as other reviewers have said.  And because I'm fanatical about aspect ratios, it's great to have the episodes in their original 4x3 size.

""But I already spent money on the DVDs,"" you say.  I did too, and wasn't going to take the plunge and buy this Blu-ray.  But Amazon has lowered the price on this so much that it's really a no-brainer.

Still on the fence?  Think: Beautiful-looking high-definition on all 158 episodes, all the extras from the DVD sets plus some new ones, sleek packaging that takes up less room on your shelf, plus you're sending a message to the studios that Yes, we want classic TV shows released in HD.

OK, time to watch another episode and laugh...",1404172800,41,1184,4.549763033175355

2068092,5,B00028G748,"This superlative series - one of my three all-time fave shows - has been gloriously transferred to blu ray with a truly jaw-dropping picture.  The mono soundtrack has been beautifully transferred, as well, leaving every sparkling piece of dialogue and sound virtually free of any static, hiss or other disturbance.  The cinematographer and technical people behind this show obviously knew their stuff because every major and miniscule detail shines through gorgeously in this transfer.

Interestingly the complex woven patterns of some of Dick Van Dyke's sport coats flickered in some of season one's episodes, signalling a resolution limitation that even blu ray's capabilities couldn't reach.  However, these disturbances seem to have vanished with season two's episodes.

This blu ray set appears to have included every one of the previous DVD release's bonus features, and there are tons of 'em.  Typically included are photos from most episodes, as well as generous amounts of interview footage of the cast that - I believe - was recorded for a Dick Van Dyke Show restrospective called 'The Dick Van Dyke Show Remembered', which I remember having aired in the early-'90s.  The only oversight I discerned was the omission of a couple of color photographs taken on the set during the filming of the episode 'Somebody Has to Play Cleopatra'.  However, one can readily find these pics online via Google Image.

Meanwhile, the bonus features of 'It May Look Like a Walnut' include a color test; this episode was apparently submitted to Legend Films to colorize using the current, fantastic colorization software they've used sensationally on movies like 'Holiday Inn' and the latest colorization of 'It's a Wonderful Life.'  Unfortunately, the resolution of this fascinating footage appears to be in standard resolution.  Additional bonus features I've found so far include the cast doing sales pitches for their sponsors (Joy dish detergent and Kent Cigarettes), as well as footage of cast and creative personnel winning well-deserved Emmys.  Overall, the bonus features would rightly be seen as being extraordinarily comprehensive for a current t.v. series, let alone one that's 50 years old.

This series seems to be routinely priced around $100 - a great value given the show's unparalleled quality, as well as the number of episodes it includes.  However, I found a blue-light special, picking it up for $50.  So, keep your eyes open, and you'll probably get lucky, too.

Image Entertainment should get fan mail for the loving care and attention they've obviously lavished on a show that so well deserves it.",1403136000,3,2613,5.23021582733813

So a lot will be sold at this price untill inventory goes down and the price will go back up. The list is $395!!! So $65 for the complete series is a GOOD DEAL.FYI first season of I Love Lucy on Bluray is $75 !!!!! Here is all FIVE SEASONS FOR $65!!!!

2068099,3,B00028G748,"Who doesn't love Dick Van Dyke(the actor).  He is funny, handsome and charming as they come. However, in my opinion this shows don't have nearly as much re-watch-and-still-enjoy ability as Andy Griffith, Beverly Hillbillies or Petticoat Junction.  After watching this for a while, I started to get sick of all the inflated egos.  There isn't anybody on the show that is humble or gracious.  This show is an classic in the American television department but I think most people use DVDs for re-watch or something to watch when they eat and this show doesn't work nearly as well to me as some of the other classics.  And if you are going to get this show for the WHOLESOME feel don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This show has everything from 666 references to suggesting polygamy is how civilize people act.

Now I'll admit the show has some great comedy to offer but it doesn't have any family feel or friendship feel anything for the heart warming which is typically found in classic television sitcoms.

Only so now for the review.

 Pros.
Good jokes through-out the series.
Highlight in the series ( never name a duck )
And you get to see some of the best physical comedy in history.

Cons.

Yes, there are still imperfections to be had; minute traces of dirt and scratches, some light speckling and a nick and chip here and there. What did you expect for a show more than sixty years old. But Image has done a phenomenal job on these transfers - uniformly pleasing and consistent and chocked full of extra features that not even some of the newer releases have received. We'd like to hope that other studios - most notably Fox - will take the hint and start giving us Mary Tyler Moore in hi-def soon. But for now, Dick, Mary and their brethren are superbly revitalized on home video. This one is a keeper, folks. Order it today. Treasure it forever.",1398297600,11,827,4.557046979865772

Over five season's, Grasse delivered a theatrical quality image rendering a fine spectrum of light with rich mid-tones that will sure to please long-time DvDS fans. This release is a significant upgrade over the otherwise fine DVD presentations.

 So far Ive bought DVDs of forty shows. Ive found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John and The Dick Van Dyke Show, which I missed the first time around. Especially, The Dick Van Dyke Show.
 It wasn't difficult to perceive the chemistry between Van Dyke and co-star Mary Tyler Moore. Years later, in an interview, the two of them looked at each other and both admitted: I had a crush on you.
Moores on-show relationship to Van Dyke as husband and wife (Rob and Laura Petrie) was more fun to watch than the visible strain on her face as later in her career she worked her way through the more honored but less funny Mary Tyler Moore Show.
The agile Van Dyke and Moore had such outstanding dance skills that the shows behind-the-scenes boss, Carl Reiner, could not resist inserting song-and-dance routines in many of the 160 episodes. Im not a fan of the old song-and-dance, not even Gene Kellys Singing in the Rain, but Van Dyke and Moore were excellent together.
This show gets my vote as the greatest comedy/variety show of all-time.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10.

2068168,5,B00028G748,"First, I want to say right up front that if you are an Amazon Prime member, you can watch this show for free. Since it is in black and white, there isn't a lot of drop off in video quality when streaming it, and all of the seasons are available. My wife saw this set at a huge discount one day and decided to get it as part of my birthday gifts, so I did not point this out to her. LOL

There are special features galore with this set, and if those are important to you, then the purchase of this set takes you well beyond the content you can get by streaming the series. If all you want to do is watch the episodes, then streaming is the way to go if you are a Prime member.

The picture and sound on this set are fantastic. On Blu ray, plenty of episodes fit on one disk, so the entire package is very space efficient.

The Dick Van Dyke show is one of the funniest sitcoms in the history of television. Even today, it beats just about any current programming hands down. The stories are generally simple compared to modern fare, but that absolutely does not matter. The comedic acting is top notch, and one of the primary writers for the show, Carl Reiner, is one of the funniest men ever in TV. Executive producers Danny Thomas and Sheldon Leonard were top comedy creators who simply produced much of the best comedy of that day.

Dick Van Dyke was already well known, but this was the vehicle that sprung Mary Tyler Moore to stardom, and the rest of the cast was solid and funny. These folks could flat out act, and toss off funny lines so quickly you have to pay rapt attention to catch them all.

With our son and family over for my birthday, I unwrapped this set and played two of my favorite episodes for them. ""Ghost of A. Chantz"" has the crew in a haunted cabin at a mountain retreat. How four actors can produce so much laughter and so much fear simultaneously is hard to understand. Then I played ""That's My Boy"", where Rob (Dick Van Dyke) is absolutely sure they have brought home the wrong baby from the hospital. Even our 13 year old granddaughter was falling out laughing.

Highly recommended.",1373068800,3,2110,4.288944723618091
2068169,5,B00028G748,"Just wanted to add my voice to the others that feel this was a great purchase.

I have the DVD set from a couple of years ago and I was reluctant to put out even more money for the Blu-Ray set, but I did it anyway and I was really stunned by the quality.  You probably already know that the Dick Van Dyke Show was one of the best sitcoms, ever (or you wouldn't be here), but the technical quality of the Blu-Ray edition was more than I expected.  I assume they went back and transferred the images from the original film, because everything is SO much clearer.  The whole show is much more enjoyable.

As a lifelong obsessed fan, I was thrilled to see lots of detail in each set and each scene.  You can see hinges in the corners of Alan Brady's office, seams in the carpets, and wood grain in the Petrie's living room that I didn't know was there.  I could even see that the tickets Rob Petrie gets to a New York show are actually tickets to a CBS Television Show in California.  But these little details are not distracting, they just make everything look more real.

The extras are great.  There are a couple short extras on each disc, like Emmy Award clips, interviews, etc.  They are fun, too.
There is also a few scenes from It May Look Like A Walnut that are in color.  I don't know the history behind that, but that extra is very cool.  I always wished the show had converted to color.

2068189,5,B00028G748,"I'll break this down into two parts, one for the set (Blu-Ray) and another for the show itself.

==========
Blu-Ray Review:
==========
Pros:
+ Image quality is nice and clear. There is some film grain, but the overall details are sharp and I've not seen any scratches or spots. I don't have the DVD version of this series to compare it to, but I have the I Love Lucy and Twilight Zone DVD sets which are soft and blurry compared to this. If you have a nice setup I would definitely spring for the Blu-Ray version.
+ Many episodes include old commercials in them (no more than 1 per episode). These are mostly laundry detergent and cigarette ads, but I think they're pretty cool. I like how they do this with The Twilight Zone as well.

Cons:
- Sound quality is 1.0 channel DTS-MA. It's not crystal clear sounding, but given that it's over 50 years old it's not bad at all. At the end of each episode's credits are a short black and white post-production credit which sounds much better than the rest of the episode.

Other Info (does not impact overall rating):
- Bonus features are mostly short interviews from the cast along with clips from award ceremonies and other promotional clips (there are episodes from other shows here and there however). I personally didn't find any of these very interesting, but I bought the set for the episodes themselves so they're just extras.
- The series is 4:3 full screen, so there will be black bars on either side.
- A lot of the clothing worn by the cast do the screen door effect on the TV (wool suits, patterned ties, etc.).

Series Review:
==========
If you've never seen the show before, I will try to compare it to I Love Lucy to help you decide.

Pros:
+ The characters of the Dick Van Dyke Show are mostly in good spirits compared to those of I Love Lucy. While I like I Love Lucy, I'm often annoyed with Lucy for her nagging/whining/childish behavior, Ethel for constant pessimism and even Fred for his occasional obsessive greed. None of that in Dick Van Dyke.
+ Dick Van Dyke is a great physical actor. If you've seen any of his other work like Mary Poppins, it will give you an idea of what to expect. Every now and then he'll fall down or get smacked (in a good way) and he's great with his falls.
+ Like Lucy, there's a lot of musical sketches. Dick Van Dyke does a lot of pop-n-lock moves, too.
+ Mary Tyler Moore is a treat to see. She's also very talented with her dancing in the show.
+ Some of the I Love Lucy cast even make appearances, like Jerry and Carolyn.

Cons:
- There's a handful of ""filler"" episodes here and there, but as there are over 150 episodes these can easily be overlooked.

Other Info (does not impact overall rating):
- The word ""sexy"" is said a few times. Doesn't offend me in the slightest, I just find it funny as I didn't think this was allowed to be said on television at the time. I would still give it a G rating though.
- Despite there being typewriters and telephones, I would still classify the show as timeless.
- The show was filmed at Desilu.

If you enjoy I Love Lucy, I think you will like the Dick Van Dyke Show as well.",1363305600,16,3128,4.353344768439108

The TV in the writer's room of the Alan Brady Show reads 19"" Magnavox, and in one 1st season episode it's visably tuned to channel 4 (KNBC or WNBC) in LA or NYC (Desilu or The Alan Brady Show). The titles of the books behind the desk are visible; you can see stitching in carpets; the writing on the back side of a piece of paper; what the individual hors d'oeuvers are on a tray. The series is excellent; I purchased the complete set on DVD when Amazon had it at a discount 4 years ago, but I'm thrilled to have the blu-ray to boot.",1362787200,14,654,4.15748031496063

There is a level of clarity and detail that you just don't have in your average sitcom from the era. It makes the whole program come alive - not that it needs to (the writing is witty and entertaining, and Dick Van Dyke and Moore both show their comedic prowess perfectly). In the midst of the Mad Men craze, it is fun to take an authentic romp back to the early sixties (pre-mini skirt), before that experiment in bad taste known as the late sixties and seventies.

2068206,5,B00028G748,"There have been sitcoms from the very beginning of television, and the very best was one that debuted in 1961.  The top comedy series contain not only physical comedy, but are superbly written, and they can probably be counted on the fingers of two hands.  The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Taxi, Cheers, and a few more.  But the king of them all is The Dick Van Dyke Show.  I don't think here was ever a funnier show on the air.

Everyone connected with the show, in front of and behind the cameras, was a terrific talent:

Carl Reiner created it, originally casting himself as a head writer of a TV variety show, but when the pilot failed, it was reworked to star Dick Van Dyke, who was at that moment enjoying great success on Broadway in ""Bye Bye Birdie.""

Van Dyke was an nimble actor who easily combined slapstick tumbles with a charm and abilty to play a situation straight, and still get laughs.

Others in the cast included Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie, both show biz veterans, as the other writers of The Alan Brady Show. Richard Deacon was the put-upon producer of the show within the show...and until this viewing of the entire series, I never realized how very much he added to the series as Mel Cooley.

Carl Reiner even got himself into the series...first as an occasional eccentric character, but then appearing in the last two seasons full onscreen as egotistical, tyrannical Alan Brady.

There were a few other regulars, but the most surprising find was a very young woman named Mary Tyler Moore.  There is no need for me to go into a resume of her later work, but I feel it is important to emphasize that before this program she was a relative unknown.  And what she brought to The Dick Van Dyke Show was the perfect wife for Rob Petrie and the perfect acting partner for Dick Van Dyke.  She could dance, sing, and her comic timing was even greater than anyone expected.  She was youthful, very pretty, and while we see that Rob and Laura loved each other enormously, you also felt there was a lot of hot foolin-around going on behind that bedroom door.

The Blu-ray set has all 158 half-hour episodes from the five seasons.  And you will likely never laugh as much or as hard.  Every episode had something, but in each season there were comic masterpieces that are still held in high esteem today: ""Coast to Coast Big Mouth,"" ""It May Look Like A Walnut!"", ""Where Did I Come From?"", and ""Oh, How We Met the Night We Danced"" are just a few of them.  And it comes to a nice conclusion with a tale that neatly wraps up the series, ""The Last Chapter.""

The picture quality is fabulous.  I watch every episode of the five seasons and I am eager to tell you that NEVER have these shows looked this wonderful! (There are some early episodes in the first season that have Dick wearing jackets that cause some jagged moments, but that is very minor.)

The DTS-HD Master Audio is in the original mono but it is excellent.

The extras that were on DVD are carried over, and there are quite a few of them (mostly in the form of commentaries).  There are also Blu exclusives on each of the 15 Blu-ray discs, but these are mostly clips from old TV programs or awards shows, and so they show varying quality, never anything like today's HD.

The Blu-ray set of The Dick Van Dyke Show contains over 60 hours of the best comedy you will ever see.  It comes VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1359763200,5,3380,4.456910569105691
2068207,5,B00028G748,"I collect alot of TV shows on DVD, with some shows one season is enough to remind you about why you enjoyed the show but after the first season the show either gets repetitive or it goes down in quality. This is not the case with the ""Dick Van Dyke Show"". With few exceptions, every episode the writing and the cast is at its best. Not only the writing is excellent but it has one of best casts ever with Dick Van Dyke (Rob Petrie), Mary Tyler Moore (Laura), Rose Marie (Sally), Morey Amsterdam (Buddy), Richard Deacon (Mel) and so forth. They are so good, you cant imagine anyone else in those roles, but they show the original pilot starring Carl Reiner and you see the orginal concept. This along with other great extras make this one of the best DVD sets ever. You won't regret buying this complete set. Makes you wish the show didn't end when it did, but they wanted to end on top and on top they did. Even the opening music is a theme you remember written by Earle Hagen, who also wrote the theme song for the ""Andy Griffith Show"". Thanks for making this one of my favorite sets which I watch often.",1359244800,2,1105,4.291866028708134
2068208,4,B00028G748,"The US has produced an enormous number of globally successful television series but its prime always remains firmly entrenched in the 1950s and 1960s.  Why?  Simply because all those associated with the shows were Vaudeville, radio, stage and screen veterans who had paid their dues through decades of commitment and hard work.  The reality is that many of those who made television great probably wouldn't even get a job on screen today because they would be deemed too old for the demographics that are being serviced.  But, their age and experience is what made them great and what made their shows truly great.  Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Groucho Marx and Dick Van Dyke were amongst the best of the best.  How fortunate for us then that Dick Van Dyke was selected by Sheldon Leonard and Carl Reiner to create what became the Dick Van Dyke Show.  Even more fortunate that he was surrounded by other enormously talented people such as Morey Amsterdam, Marie Tyler Moore and Rose Marie.

The Bluray set provides sparkling, crystal-clear prints of every episode - the images are so sharp that you can almost make out every fiber on the clothes that the cast wear.  The high quality prints, in dazzling black and white, reveal a very, very slick, fast-paced, modern comedy that has aged very little - if at all.  The dialog is sophisticated and witty, even when episodes have only a light comic touch to them.  In every single episode Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore stand out as utterly charming and engaging characters with whom it's a pleasure to spend time.  That's not something that can be said about modern sitcoms which are so stage-managed in terms of studio-audience feedback that none of the characters can become realistic enough to be engaging.  On the Dick Van Dyke Show, the staging is reserved for the mythical ""Alan Brady"" variety show, for which most of the cast work as writers - remarkably this comes across as a thoroughly believable enterprise - and who wouldn't want Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie writing their comedy sketches.

There are only two very minor downsides to this series - which shouldn't distract anyone from purchasing the set.  The first is how many episodes were devoted to flashbacks about how Laura and Rob first met - and just when one has had more than their fill of these, Dick Van Dyke steps out of character and appears on screen to announce that there will be another four episodes devoted to their meeting.  The second (minor) downside comes from the episodes devoted to Dick Van Dyke's on-and-off-screen brother, which are quite lame and not in keeping with the standard of the rest - ideal episodes to watch in fast forward before moving back to the great ones.  These minor issues notwithstanding, the Dick Van Dyke Show is magical television - and will keep people laughing for many hours.

People who buy this should also consider the complete box sets of ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Honeymooners"" and ""You Bet Your Life"".",1358985600,12,2974,4.798039215686274

The episodes are well written, with sharp, witty humor and a GREAT cast. Mary Tyler Moore was, at the time of this show, quite possibly the most beautiful woman in Hollywood.

2068246,4,B00028G748,The Dick Van Dyke Show - The Complete Series is the complete record of a classic TV show. The cast and the writers have been complimented for turning out a gem of a series and the episodes look fresh. But the box they come in is so tight that I spilled most of the disc jackets on the floor just trying to remove one disc jacket to play the disc. I had to sort out the fallen disc jackets just to make sure they were put back in the correct order.,1335484800,3,447,3.923076923076923
2068247,5,B00028G748,"I got this on a gold box deal and just couldn't pass it up.  It was off the air before I was even born, but I remember seeing some of the reruns in the early 70's when I was a kid and remembered my family always laughing.

The box itself is neat, with the holographic kind of TV screen.  Discs are individually cased, so none of the common ""two disks together that came loose and scratched each other up"" problems.  The picture is great, sound is awesome for something done in the early 60's.

Besides the magical performances by all the cast, I think the best thing about this series was the timelessness.  Yeah, the simplistic situations show the time period, but they did the show in a timeless fashion, with no references to the period it was set in.  So watching it, there's nothing they discuss as far as world events or politics or anything that nails it down to that decade.

Evidently it's also the last series that was filmed in black and white for the entirety of its run.

And despite the limited options they had for humor on TV in the early 60's, the crisply clean humor and wit is still razor sharp, and there's a ton of laugh out loud moments in every episode.

The acrobatics of Dick Van Dyke, the physical humor, just priceless.  And of course Mary Tyler Moore was just beautiful in here.  Great collection!",1334275200,3,1325,4.407407407407407
2068248,5,B00028G748,"I Love Lucy, I'd love to be stranded on Gilligan's Island, but I really wanna lounge around the Petrie's cool house and work with Buddy and Sally!!

This was my favorite rerun growing up in the 1970's.  The show has wonderful slapstick comedy but is written with an intelligence and wit that all other shows must live up to.

This boxes set is simply amazing!  Every single episode is here, plus tons of extras.  The extras include the complete lost pilot ""Head of the Family"" in which Carl Reiner plays the lead.  There are also clips from various Emmy award ceremonies of the era, product ads, interviews with the cast, audio commentary by the cast and a complete vintage gameshow episode where the cast of DVD show play charades.  Brilliant.

The picture quality is first rate.  The transfer is exceptionally clean.  I can watch it on my 55"" HDTV and the detail is amazing.  You can see the subtle details Dick's sport coats and on the set.  Each episode is chapterized for easy navigation.  And every episode is presented in its full original version, not the trimmed down syndicated versions I grew up with.  I finally get to see complete scenes that were cut out to make room for more commercials when the shows went into reruns.

You kids will love to watch it.  My 1-year old daughter goes nuts when she hears the opening theme music.  She loves to watch the show with me...even at 1yo!!!  I can't recommend this set enough.",1334102400,4,1432,4.592885375494071
2068262,5,B00028G748,"Yes, all those things that have been said a million times about the show are true. There are four simple, yet undeniable reasons that it was groundbreaking and remains timeless:
1) For maybe the first time, you not only knew what Dad did for a living, you saw Rob Petrie at work as much as you did at home. And both lives impacted each other, just like in real life.
2) The chemistry between Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore was indeed palpable. This was the first TV couple that actually seemed like they were in love (and lust), not just either parrying (ala Lucy & Desi and Ralph & Alice) or parenting (ala Ward & June and Jim & Margaret).
3) The writing was smart, sophisticated and flat-out hilarious.
4) The casting was one of those rare brilliant / lucky strokes of alchemy that created a true ensemble that worked beautifully together.

The DVD sets are everything TV box sets should be, especially sets of vintage shows. Each episode is digitally remastered from the original 35mm negatives, restored to its full length with over three minutes of restored footage that was edited for syndication. Bonus materials abound, including photo galleries of promotional stills, sponsor ads, show promos, interviews with the cast and audio commentary on a handful of episodes from Dick, Carl, Rose Marie, Ann Morgan Guilbert and Larry Matthews.

Actually, the commentaries are the least satisfying bonuses. Sadly typical of DVD commentaries, there's precious little background or insight and a whole lot of head rattling and cobweb dusting. Hindered by the fact that they were recording while watching the show with NO SOUND (at times for the first time in decades), the cast spends an awfully lot of time trying to remember what the characters on the show were SAYING. Why, oh why can't people record commentaries with one earpiece playing the show so they can actually comment on what's happening? Or at least watch the episode once through before they start taping?

Another bonus is a full episode of STUMP THE STARS, a charades game (also known as PANTOMIME QUIZ) that ran through the fifties into the early 60's. Included here is a show where Dick, Rosie, Morey and Mary challenge Sebastian Cabot, Diana Dors, Beverly Garland and Ross Martin... and lose! It's a bizarre little time capsule, but not half as funny as the game of charades from episode 63, ""All About Eavesdropping"" (On the Street Where You Live!!!!).

The real gem of a bonus is on the first set: HEAD OF THE FAMILY was the unsold pilot that would later become THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW. HOTF (filmed in late 1958) had the same plot, the same characters, but a totally different cast, including creator / writer Carl Reiner as Rob Petrie (here pronounced like the dish). Seeing Morty Gunty playing a 23 year old Buddy Sorrell is jarring and just... wrong. Plus, Gary Morgan makes Ritchie Petrie a thousand times more grating than Larry Matthews ever was. While not awful, HOTF clearly shows that good writing is not enough to make a sitcom work, and makes THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW shine even brighter in contrast.

Sophisticated, sarcastic, sweet, silly, slapstick and a lot of other alliterative adjectives, THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW was rare perfection. Even at its quaintest, it never feels dated. Forty years later, it remains timeless, laugh out loud funny, genuinely touching and utterly believable. This is a DVD set that won't just sit unwatched. This is an ottoman worth tripping over.",1334102400,2,3459,4.8263069139966275

Naturally, the Dick Van Dyke show is a great show, clean, and very funny from back when comedy was actually funny.  However, anyone can find out about the show on the internet and see parts of it or see a few re-runs on TV.  This review is primarily on the quality of the discs, not the  show.

Haven't watched through the entire collection yet, but we are through season 1.  Some early episodes tend to freeze up occasionally, but our DVD player eventually manages to get past it.  Switched them over to a newer DVD player, and it seems to play them better, although they still freeze up occasionally.  We purchased these new, unopened and they arrived from Amazon just that way--new in the original shrink wrap.  However, after they froze up a few times, I inspected the discs and found some very faint scuffs on the playing sides.  Not enough to be a major problem, but this is the first time I've bought a new, unopened DVD that was not absolutely pristine and spotless on the playing side.  There very end of season 1 and so far into season 2 the freezing seems to have gone away.

Overall, we are pleased with the discs, although I would expect flawless play-ability from a new collection of this price.  I would buy these again and do recommend them.",1325894400,6,1340,4.487603305785124

True, it was the Kennedy and post-Kennedy era, and Rob and Laura represented that whole Kennedys era generational media thing.  Ironically, the clothes: they always reminded me of the types of stuff they would sell at that old defunct Kennedy Department Stores chain.  Even for the '60s, all the characters' wardrobe seemed perpetually stuck through its 5-season run in 1961...too many outdated-becoming spiked heels, thin ties, bouffant and Peter Gun hairstyles, Peter Pan collars, and ""do the twist"" dresses to the knee.

2068287,5,B00028G748,"THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW: Based on creator CARL REINER's experiences as a writer/actor for ""golden age"" TV series YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS, TDVDS starred  versatile rubber-limbed comic DICK VAN DYKE. ROB PETRIE, head scribe for the fictional ALAN BRADY SHOW (REINER made scene stealing cameos as its meglomaniacal star), was ably supported by borscht-belt comics ROSE MARIE and MOREY AMSTERDAM as his wisecracking staff, and MARY TYLER MOORE as his charming hand-wringer of a wife LAURA. Unlike its sitcom predecessors, PETRIE's work life was given as much screen time as his domestic adventures in a comfy New Rochelle suburb. Going to the office seldom seemed so inviting, especially one equipped with sofa, TV, dartboard, and other creature comforts. RICHARD DEACON's unflappable producer MEL COOLEY interrupted the highjinks often, perfectly cast as ALAN BRADY's whipping boy, not to mention BUDDY SORRELL's verbal  punching bag. Slapstick bits, comedy monologues, and vibrant song and dance routines were all woven seamlessly into the plotlines, giving the talented cast a chance to mug and shine. Sexy and chic ROB & LAURA PETRIE were TV's ""first couple"", and the intelligent scripts, often supplied by REINER, placed the show several rungs above the competition. This is as sophisiticated, hip and hilarious as early 60s TV ever got. VAN DYKE himself has admitted that doing this series was the most fun he ever had...and it shows in every warm embrace and expertly executed pratfall.

RATING: FIVE OTTOMANS",1309219200,,1506,5.266666666666667
2068291,5,B00028G748,"""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" was the first show I can remember that took itself off the air before it got stale.  This is five years of great television with nary a single bad episode.  It's one of those shows where everything clicked, most obviously the on-screen chemistry of it's cast.  Most situation comedies that followed, owe a debt of gratitude to this show for establishing interesting characters who obviously enjoyed being around each other.  It was one of the first early examples of an ""ensemble comedy"".

A major force behind the shows success was its creator Carl Reiner.  Besides playing the part of boss Alan Brady and occasionally appearing in other supporting guest roles, he was responsible for the overall tone of the show and wrote several of the scripts.  Obviously drawing from some of his experiences while working with Sid Ceasar on ""Your Show of Shows"", Reiner gave the viewer an interesting insider look at the inner workings of a variety show writing staff.

It's also interesting to watch the on-screen development of Mary Tyler Moore's acting and comedic skills while portraying Laura Petrie, the main character's wife.  Its easy to see this show was a training ground for her as well as a major influence of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" which would air five years later and become another huge success.

There are lots of memorable episodes, but watch for ""I'm No Henry Walden"" in particular.  Rob and Laura get invited to a fundraising party and end up feeling out of place amongst the eccentric and wealthy guests (including Carl Reiner as a stuffy author).  This episode has most everything in it that makes trhe series great including some of its most memorable lines and characters.  A snooty socialite declares upon meeting TV writer Rob Petrie, ""Oh, I'm so sorry.  You see, I don't own a television machine.""  Or the lisping poet who donates the proceeds from his latest collection - ""Lavender Lollipops"".

Also watch for the first episodes with Jerry Van Dyke as Rob's sleepwalking brother (""I am My Brother's Keeper"" and ""The Sleeping Brother"").  It launched the comic's career and you can see why here.  He goes from being the painfully shy brother who can't look you in the eye while awake to the boisterous banjo-playing wannabe comedian when sleepwalking. Its a near-perfect performance.

I highly recommend this collection.",1308873600,,2364,4.939240506329114

I watched these shows when I was a kid and they have not lost their charm, comedy, wit or timelessness.  In one special interview on one of the disks, I think it was Carl Reiner who said they purposely avoided time-period references like the hippie movement, The Beatles, Elvis, etc, specifically so that the show would never age. Of course, when you see the furniture, clothing, etc., it's dated, but it's all background compared to the comedy. I have enjoyed every episode so far and can't wait to see more.

2068295,5,B00028G748,"Can a television show have a somewhat rebellious hero, who has a totally beautiful wife, a narcissistic boss, and zany co-workers, be topical, and fresh, and full of human feelings, doubts -- and laughter -- and use NO four-letter words?  The timeless classic, 'THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW', is all these things -- and more!

In thesd days of truly wild TV -- such as the farcical and sometimes incomprehensible ""GLEE"", and the sexual-innuendos, (and often, not just innuendos -- but just sex), of the also-difficult-to-follow-the-plot, ""SKINS"", people, (especially younger ones), NEED to see shows like ""THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW"".  'Rob Petrie', (Dick Van Dyke), is the head-writer, (of a group of three writer, including himself), of 'The Alan Brady Show' -- a TV variety (I think) program.
'Alan Brady', his boss, (played by Carl Reiner....Rob Reiner's real-life father), is a complete ego-maniac, and the show's producer, Mel Cooley, (played by Richard Deacon), isn't much better.  Rob often chaffes under the injustice meeted out by these two -- but, under the genuis of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show""'s REAL writers, these injustices, though very real, do not make us depressed....merely, we admire how Rob fights against them, and laugh at the comedic circumstances in which they occur.

It's nice to see a show about WRITERS, for a change.  Because most people -- except for the stars, of course -- of most entertainment vehicles, are considered to be ""Not Anybody"".  Rob Peitrie -- and his fellow writing-staff members -- may be in a 'glamour' industry, (television) -- but they are part of the ""unknowms"" of that industry....the people whose names flash upon the screen, (in both TV and movies), for a few seconds....then are forgotten.  They have been designated as, ""the little people"", in more than one drama.  But Rob and his fellow-writers, being ""little people"", are definitely people us other ""little people"", (whether we work in TV -- or in a grocery store), can SO easily relate to!  Rob and his staff are often FAR more intelligent than either Alan or Mel -- and the comedic incidents this justaposition leaves, are truly landmark TV.  The genuis of this show is that it is SO well-written, SO funny, with comedic situations evolving SO logically, (most of the time), and with characters SO endearingly true-to-life, that even the ""Alan Bradies"" and ""Mel Coolies"" of the REAL world will, hopefully, buy this set, and laugh along with ""us peasants"" -- thereby gaining, (one hopes), even a slight psycological insight into the lives of the ""ordinary"" people who work for them.....

But mainly, this show is about LAUGHTER!  The situations -- their beginning and evolvment --are not forced, and not convoluted.  They just HAPPEN....and with a perfect comedic timing that can only be matched by Bob Hope.  But -- unlike Mr. Hope -- remarks mixing the ""real world"" and the fantasy-world of the people who work for the 'Alan Brady Show', and those they come into contact with, are never
heard.  It's easy to ""suspend disbelief"" in the world of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", because it believes so much in itself.  And the comedy comes naturally, from the situations presented, evolving logically -- and never forced.

Rob's two co-writers are gems of realism, made funny by what they say, and how they react to what happens.  However, (probably because it WAS produced in the 1960s, when ""Women's Lib"" was first taking hold), the character of Rob's female co-writer, Sally Rogers, (played by Rose Marie), was both a symbol of women's abilities, and a female stereotype, at the same time.  As a female writer, )especially one with two male collegagues), Sally certainly showed that a woman's brain, and creative talent, could match any man's.  But Sally -- being single -- was always seen looking for ""Mr. Right"".  In fact, when talking of her own life, most of her lines were about her singleness, and her endless searh for a mate.  Nothing wrong with wanting to find a husband, of course -- but the fact that this idea DOMINATES Sally Rogers' every waking moment, is indeed a stereotype.  However,
she is often seen as fellow-writer, friend, and collaborator with her two male colleagues, as well.  Like them, she has her share of situation-induced laughs, and, whilst involved in most epsiodes' plotlines, is simply a character within those plotlines.  Her ""husband-hunting"" is always an element -- but, thank God, not the ONLY elememnt in Sally's character.  (In the first episode, Sally is NOT wearing her trade-mark black hair-bow....but it appears in every other episode.
WHY did she wear it?  Anyone know?)

Buddy Sorrell, (played by Morey Amsterdam), is, in many respects, more of a rebel than Rob.  Often, Mel will speak in an (almost)-cordial way to Rob and Sally -- but there is a true WAR going on between Mel's ego and Buddy's.  Butddy SNIPES at Mel, (and perhaps at Alan, as well...I haven't gone through the entire set yet, but it does seem a logical assumption).  Unlike Sally, Buddy IS married...but often wishes he wasn't.  His wife, (""Pickles""), often makes Buddy's life far less than pleasant -- and he often makes very funny remarks, describing these things.

Rob's wife, Laura, (played by the stunningly beautiful Mary Tyler Moore), is. at one and the same time, the perfect wife and mother, and also totally her own person.  That Laura and Rob love each other is obvious, and we never doubt it.  But Laura often has her OWN opinions that clash, ever so lovingly, with Rob's.  She can get into scrapes, as well, (but not quite so many as Donna Reed did, on ""The Donna Reed Show"" -- another excellent, 1960s TV comedy series, which -- like most of the other '60s comedies, revolved more around a family than around the father's, or mother's job.  Still a great show, though!)  I've sen it written about Laura Petrie, that ""she got away with more than most wives do"".  This was written some time ago, though -- and Laura Petrie stands out as a TV character who is a wife, mother, and former dancer -- who, though completely loving her son and her husband, is a total individual, with a mind, and will of her own!  Laura / Mary was also written up as a woman who taught other women how to dress -- and her capri pants, and modest, though extremely stylish dresses, indeed did this.

Laura's sister is married to a dentist, and the two of them, (the Harpers), who are the Petrie's next-door neighbours, add to the fun.

This program is full of comedic situations that grow funnier and funnier as the episode progresses.  It is full of good, underplayed and totally realistic acting,
great scripts, and involving story-lines.  Like most of the '60s comedies, the laughs were NOT made by each character criticizing the others.  No, it was the SITUATINS that ALL the characters created and/or fought, that created the delightful comedy here.  Today's ""comedy"" TV shows are all about people criticizing EACH OTHER.  This makes for a sad example for people to follow in real life.  Hope and happy endings mix, in The Dick Van Dyke show, with trials, tribulations and worry.  After suffering the comedic slings and arrows of the often outrageously unfair, (but always very funny), situations, there is always a happy ending.  This show gives hope that ""we little people"" can MAKE it, no matter what.  And that's not a bad thing for any era in human history, especially today's ""pre-2012"" era.  So, learn to be positive, as you laugh along with Rob and the gang.  Even the very last episode evolves SO logically, that the viewer can't
get away from the feeling that ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" will go on forever!  And, in these wonderful videos, it does just that!

This is truly TIMELESS comedy, and everyone should get to see at least one episode.  Of course, one's pleasure is increased exponentially by getting the bargain-priced set of all five seasons, presented here.  there are many extras included with this set -- including the pilet episode for the series, which had a different cast, (Carl Reiner here played ""Rob Petrie""), and a different comedic slant.  Personally, I felt the original pilot was far inferior to the show that finally evolved from it.  But you watch, and compare, and make your own decisions....

Carl Reiner here comments on the original pilot, and there are interviews with the cast, old commercials, and a recording of a post-program production, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show Remembered.""

All of the 25 narrow, individual disc-cases have a photo from one of the programs on that disc in the front, and detailed information about each episode -- and two pictures from the enclosed episodes -- on the back,  The cardboard case in which these discs come, has additional photos --and, in the front, a holographic ""mini-movie"" of Laura trying to open up a portable bed.  A wonderful and information-packed booklet also comes with this set.

Definitely funny.  Denfinitely classic.  Definitely amongst the best TV situation comedies ever.  If you can't afford this set immediately, do save up for it.  Show it to your friends, relatives -- both those who are well, and those who are ill.  (Laughter, they say, is the best medicine...and it is!)  Show it to older people who saw it on TV, and have the fondest memories of it.  Show it to younger people, who are used to shows with a pessimistic outlook, four-letter words, and comedy which is based on people being nasty to, and making fun of, each other.  Show ti on Christmas Eve, on anniversries, birthdays, family get-togethers, and anytime you are feeling lonely and depressed.  Your, (and their) outlook on life will be made happier.  You and whoever sits wilh you, will be happily transformed.  You will NOT be sorry.

This is one great set!",1304899200,4,9725,4.8585306618093504

I was excited and immediately wanted to watch 2 of my favorite episodes before going out for brunch. My sons (10,12 & 14) really enjoyed watching with me so we ended up making brunch at home while Dick Van Dyke and his team entertained us! The fun that surrounded us while we watched the shows transferred over to the rest of our day.

That night my sons wanted to watch several more episodes. As they fell asleep, I heard them talking and chuckling about the crazy things that had happened in the episodes. They were amazed at Morey Amsterdam's quick wit and just how funny Dick Van Dyke and the others made everyday life. My husband and I appreciated the clean humor and that our boys really enjoyed the same things we did about the shows. I know will always smile when I remember the day I received this collection.

2068299,5,B00028G748,"I grabbed the complete Dick Van Dyke series the other day when it was $66.99. What an amazing bargain!! The first episode my wife and I watched was the, I believe, never-aired pilot episode: Head of the family; with Carl Reiner as Rob Peeeetrie (sic). While the germ of a great show was present, the masterminds of Carl Reiner and CBS to cast Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore (along with Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie) was inspired. The rest is TV history. The chemistry of the cast is second to none. Right up there with Lucy and Andy. The scripts are taught; the musical bits are spot on; but the chemistry between Van Dyke and Moore is for the ages.
The DVDs are presented in a beautiful keep-sake box with a hilarious hologram of Laura Petrie succumbing to her curiosity... You have to see the episode to appreciate it.
I, too wish the episode were in original broadcast order. It leads to continuity errors in the episodes. For example, in episode one, Rob and Laura are invited to Alan Brady's house for a party, but in the very next DVD episode, Rob states that he hasn't been to Alan's house since he signed his contract. Oh well. The trade off is that you will receive 157 episodes of pure family fun. Innocent, delicate, refreshing and suitable for the entire family. Get your kids together once a week and share an hour or two with them and demonstrate what worthwhile television used to be. My highest recommendation.",1302739200,,1432,4.554263565891473

2068315,4,B00028G748,"Love the complete series set, but there is one exasperating and questionable organizing principle for the boxed set. The episodes are arranged not when they were shown on TV (which one might expect to be the standard), but rather according to when an individual episode was filmed. So, you have such odd occurrences as the second show aired (but 9th episode filmed) in Season One is not included in Disc One but on Disc Two. You have to consult the ""aired"" date to know if the fifth listed episode was actually the fifth episode to run on TV. One would think fans of the series (and I count myself as one) prefer to see the episodes in the order that they appeared on TV. Why should film date take precedent? So, essentially, if you want to see the series as it was first shown, you have to constantly switch from one disc to the next after you've sorted through the information regarding ""filmed"" date and ""first aired"" date.",1302480000,15,926,4.517857142857143

HOWEVER...why, oh why, is there no list of the bonus features? There's no list included, nothing on or in the individual sleeves...nothing. The 12-page booklet has some fun trivia, but why couldn't they add another few pages to catalog the bonus material? Do I really have to browse the menus of each individual disk?

I tried looking up each season here on Amazon as someone suggested, but that doesn't work. Example...the standalone second season set has rehearsals listed as a bonus, but after looking at every second season disk in this complete set, I find nothing of the sort.

On our 42"" HDTV the black & white shows look even better than I remembered. The transfer to the DVD format is one of the best that I have seen, and I own four other sets of 60s TV shows.

This is another one of those series I watch over and over.  Currently, I am on my second round of the entire set.  I LOVE Dick Van Dyke's talent with physical comedy!  ALL of the cast is talented and wonderful.  Some of the episodes include live singing and dancing that is really good.  How refreshing!  And how refreshing to escape back to a time when good neighbors came in through the back door and shared a cup of coffee.  In The Dick Van Dyke Show world, dysfunctional just meant a tough day at the office, only to come home to find that Laura also had a rough day, so the evening wasn't so great.  This show takes us back to rotary phones, record players and radios, kids who played outside with their own imagination and kind folks who dressed for dinner.  The clothes are unbelievable.  The show is top of the line, and so is the DVD set. It's very organized and easy to maneuver within the episode.  I like that you click on the show title and can see all of the chapters on one page.  That way, if you have to stop in the middle of a show, when you go back to that episode, you can see all of the chapters on one page without having to click through more pages to see the rest of the chapters.  The special features' link is on the same page as the chapters, and they're awesome.  They include clips from awards shows and individual interviews with the cast (including Morey Amsterdam) about the moments they remember from that particular episode.  It's hard to review such an excellent series, because it's all good.  The comedy is brilliant, still so funny today, and the actors do a fantastic job delivering it.

These are shows recorded during the times when the simplicity of life transformed into great comedy. The show is simply: Best-In-Class!

Mary Tyler Moore plays the part of Laura Petrie, wife of Rob Petrie, a TV comedy writer played by non-other than Dick Van Dyke... and they do an excellent job as they share their married life, the work related trials and tribulations and the day to day struggle to balance parenthood, jobs and house work.

One of the benefits of these shows is the opportunity to see great talent of the time as invited guests and it is with great pleasure that we relive the experience.

Son Ritchie, played by Larry Matthews is adorable, Sally Rogers played by Rose Marie is excellent and the famous ""human joke machine"" Buddy Sorrell played by Morey Amsterdam will keep you laughing the entire episode. As for the mean boss; Alan Brady played by Reiner, he opens the door to such fun that we look forward to his appearance, especially when Buddy takes shots at him.

that was truly a head of its time for TV.  Way back in the
late 1950's and early 60's TV was blessed with this one of a
kind comedy that wrote the book for what laughter was really
supposed to be.  This Show,...""The Dick Van Dyke Show""
started a revolution of what was to come.  It had an ensemble
likable cast of superstars.  To think this show was almost
canceled in the first year because of low ratings.  Today a
show is canceled in a few episodes without given a second
chance.  Thank heavens there was NO Cable TV to speak of or
the competition would have been overwhelming to ax the show.
We were lucky that cable was in its infancy and CBS took a
second look at this great comedy genius of a show.  Many
cast members went on to be even bigger stars.  There were
Dick Van Dyke as Robert Petrie, Richard Deacon as Mel and he
came from ""leave It To Beaver"" , Rose Marie and Morey
Amsterdam, Carl Reiner as the boss, Larry Mathews as Richie
the son, Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Petrie, and she went on
to star in her own show in 1970.  ""The Dick Van Dyke Show""

As a parent, I gladly taped ""The Chairman's Favorites"" when they aired on Nick at Nite. I played the episodes back to my daughter -- who was probably just 8 or 9 at the time -- and she laughed her head off (especially over the ""wrong baby"" episode). Now she's 27, and still enjoys the show.

That's the magic power of DVD: good clean humor for all ages, with plots that are strong on the ""well...it KINDA could happen..."" side.

Too bad that shows like this one could never find a home on TV today.",1250035200,3,947,4.273743016759776
2068357,5,B00028G748,"I was too young to see the original Dick Van Dyke series when it was originally on.  I remember seeing it as reruns on daytime T.V.  It was before cable so obviously network TV was doing re-runs.  I probably was in my early teens.  I feel in love with the show.  I even snuck away from work (I only work 4 blocks from home) when it was on TV Land at 8:00 am my time.

This DVD set is everything I would ever want in a set.  It has great graphics on each DVD cover.  It is not a dual-sided disk.  It has great special features, including interviews with the actors and the actors talking about the show as it is shown (they voice over the show).  Their comments were real interesting!!  You can really tell the actors loved being a part of this quality show.  The writing is so well done; it just blows me away in comparison to today's poorly written shows.  There are so many twists & turns in the shows, that you cannot guess how it is going to turn out.  The actors are real characters, people who could be your co-workers, boss or neighbors.  The characters are also well-developed & their actors doing the parts really play the part.

If you have never seen the Dick Van Dyke show or only seen some episodes on TV Land (where the entire show is not seen due to commercial time needed), but love true classics such as movies like Desk Set - you will love this set.  Buy it & watch it again & again.  You won't be sorry.",1237334400,3,1422,4.165441176470588

2068361,5,B00028G748,"This past Christmas, my parents surprised me with the complete series of The Dick Van Dyke Show, one of my all-time favorite shows.  Having grown up watching some of these on TV Land, it's great to see the entire collection episode by episode in in crystal clear clarity.  As a kid, I used to laugh at the funny antics, but now that I'm a grown adult I can say that this is one of the best--if not the best--examples of sophisticated TV comedy.

The DVDs were not only packaged well, but there are multiple special features that are just as fun to watch as the program itself.  I own many TV series, some of which are other complete series, but none of them have as many--if any--special features.  It's great to see the actors talk about their roles years later, and to hear the audio commentaries by Dick Van Dyke (Rob Petrie), Carl Reiner (creator/Alan Brady), Don Rickles (Lyle Delp), Gary Marshall (writer), etc.  I especially enjoyed the Emmy presentations, and ""The Making of 'It May look like a walnut'"" featurrette.

But, the best part of this series, is that the shows are seen as originally aired, and some with commercials done by the cast.  This is truly the best TV on DVD offering.  So, if you're looking for a collection with great story-lines, great comedy, and kid-friendly values, this is the collection to get.

2068367,5,B00028G748,"The Dick Van Dyke Show consistently ranks high in most critics list of the best sit-coms ever.  It also ranks high in most lists of best television programming of any type.

Along with the Andy Griffith Show, it is probably one of the best 2 sit-coms of the entire decade of the 1960's - a decade which produced many memorable sitcoms.

It broke ground in many ways, and not just in portraying a housewife who wears slacks when she is working around the house.  It was one of the first programs to be both a ""work-comedy"" and a ""domestic-comedy"" at the same time.  It was different from most domestic comedies at the time by having as it's main characters a trendy and upscale young suburban couple living in a tract house development.  Earlier family-based sitcoms had often focussed exclusively on the kids and the parents played secondary roles, like Leave it to Beaver. Earliersit-coms usually had the family living in an old fashioned two-story frame house on a tree-lined city street complete with sidewalks.  This was typical of the upper middle class in the pre-war days, but by 1961 young middle class families were overwhelmingly locating in the suburban development.  Finally, in early family sitcoms, the father's job is only hinted at, never playing a real role in the plotlines.

The Dick Van Dyke Show changed that.  The Petrie family lived in a post-war suburb within communting distance of a large city, just like a large portion of Americans lived by 1961.  The domestic aspects of the show were up to date and the cosmopolitan tastes and interests of Rob and Laurua reflected a life-style that young ""New Frontier"" 30-something couples around America liked to think of as representing themselves.

At Rob's office, there was also a nice behind the scenes look into the making of a variety sketch television show - a tv genre that starting to decline in the early 60's.  The show seems a little dated in some ways today, but it was very much on top of the spirit of its own time.

Aside from all this, though, the program is just plain funny.  Van Dyke's physical humor, Morey Amsterdam's quick wit and Mary Tyer Moore's humorous facial and vocal expressions all complement one another, and each role is perfectly cast and each character is easy to like and relate to.  The interaction among the colleagues at the office is fast paced and full of good one-liners.  The friendship that the Petrie's share with their next-door neighbors (a dentists and slightly homely wife) adds a less glamorous but more common touch to the show, but the marriage relation between Rob and Laura really remains the primary focus of the program.

Running gags throughout the series include Carl Reiner's toupe, Buddy and Mel's mutual feud and Rob's stories about his old Army days (which gives the show a chance to change its setting and format occasionally).  There are also a handful of dream episodes, which was something of an innovation at the time.

Reruns of the program have not been aired regularly since TVLAND took it out of the lineup a few years ago, so I do make a lot of use of this boxed set.

Highly, highly recommended.",1221350400,3,3136,4.749077490774908
2068368,5,B00028G748,"After re-watching a dozen episodes from The Dick Van Dyke Show, I changed my mind and decided that I should, after all, write an Amazon review for the series. Not because I think many people will see my review, which will undoubtedly be hidden beneath multiple pages of previously-posted reviews. Not because I think Amazon readers need any more recommendations to get this set after reading the scores of such recommendations already present. Not even because it would be fun to reminisce as I wrote the review about everything I liked about the show over the years. No, I decided to write this review because, after rewatching these classic episodes again, I realized afresh that The Dick Van Dyke Show is one of the best, perhaps THE best, comedy series I've ever seen, and if even a single person watches this show for the first time because of this review, the effort would be entirely justified.

There are lots of funny TV shows, but I can't think of any that have affected me like The Dick Van Dyke Show has. My childhood is filled with the memories of watching the show with my father as I grew up. We sat there together, laughing out loud, over and over again, day after day, and felt like we were special guests to be asked into Rob and Laura Petrie's family each week. But were these childhood memories just a figment of my passing childhood, laughs that would disappear with time and a new social context? Not one bit. As I watch these shows in sparkling, crystal-clear DVD format (the ""DVD"" being no relation to ""Dick Van Dyke""!), I find myself laughing - and enjoying - these episodes as if I never saw them before. And even when I have the jokes and the sequences memorized - and for many of them, I do - I can find no other reaction other than to laugh out loud as I did when I was kid. This is a downright, flat-out funny, witty, enjoyable, and entertaining program.

Can comedy be funny without resort to off-color language? Can shtick and physical humour actually be supremely hilarious? Can an element of sophistication be woven into comedy so that the audience can laugh at itself without being insulted? Can timeless themes be woven into stories that actually entertain? One needs watch only a handful of Dick Van Dyke Show episodes easily to quickly affirm each of these questions. And perhaps more impressively, its easily apparent that the cast and crew pull this off silky ease, belieing the true work that was put into the show. There's no question about it: the writing, the plot lines, the acting, and the personal charm of those involved in The Dick Van Show set a standard apart from others, a standard that sees no wear from the ravages of time. It doesn't matter that we are watching black-and-white in a clearly post-1950's suburban home and work setting: we see color and modernity even as we look right through these unimportant backdrops. The themes and talent that pours out of nearly every episode is unaffected by time, setting, and costume.

I once heard Carl Reiner say that Dick Van Dyke was the most talented entertainer he had ever known. It's hard to disagree with him once we've seen the show. Van Dyke is like Rowan Atkinson, but in spades, and with an inner charm that endears the watcher. He can sing, he can dance, he can tell jokes with precision timing, he can use understatement as a weapon, and he can make us totally sympathetic to his plights without appearing whiny. Rob Petrie, but more importantly, Dick Van Dyke, strikes us as an intensely decent person imbued with a joy of life that pervades everything he does. Actually, we are CONVINCED he is an intensely decent person, and we are just there for the ride as we watch him move through life with all its comic ups and downs. He could have never done it without Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, and Mary Tyler Moore (not to mention all the others who worked on the show before the camera), but Van Dyke stands out as that supremely gifted individual, a talent amongst a group of talents, Holland's gift to America. That so many gifted individuals could work together without stepping on each other's toes is a miracle in itself. It's an assemblage of people rarely seen, and I fear, not to be seen again for a long time.

Season One gets off to a rocky start. In retrospect, we can see the show is trying to figure out itself, trying to understand how all the pieces work together, trying to determine how stories are to be assembled for best impact. The show was slated for cancellation twice that year, and only after Sheldon Leonard stepped in to rescue it - and a change of time slot for Season Two right after the successful Beverly Hillbillies - did the show take off.

But in Season Two, the show takes off like no rocket you've ever seen before. Season One has some strong episodes and great plot ideas, but it's Season Two that sees the cast working in a seamless, slick, and sophisticated manner that turns the show into a timeless classic. It's almost as if everyone involved realized they were given a second chance, and with that, the gloves came off, the worries were put aside, and everyone just got ""into the groove."" The show knocked out one outstanding episode after another, and by the time Season Five occurred, everyone knew that this might likely be the highlight of their careers. The show was ended at the height of it's popularity because of Reiner's insistence - he said he did not want to show to die slowly, but go out while at the top of form - and we can only wonder what a ""Season Six"" might have held for us. But it's no matter. These are comedic masterpieces at the top of form, a goal for others to try and match, and a standard by which all others are measured.

If you've never seen The Dick Van Dyke Show and wonder what it is about, I'll tell you. It's about a somewhat charmed life of a regular group of people who are talented, happy, and good natured and who face the normal problems, irritation, and strange events that are a part of nearly everyone's life. That's all you need to know. Start with Season Two and work forward from there. When you are done, go back to Season One and see how they figured it all out in those early months. But by then, you'll already be won over by the many wonderful episodes, and will doubtless be re-watching these over and over again. Millions of people of have done so over the years. To watch these episodes is to easily understand why.

A Note on the Technical Quality of the Blu-Ray Release (2013)
Well, it finally happened: the already high-quality DVD release of the complete Dick van Dyke Show has now been released in high definition Blu-Ray format. And in spite of the quality of the DVD release (these truly are a very high quality DVD offering), the Blu-Ray release improves it even further. It appears as though the high definition scans of the original film has brought out incredible detail present in the film that has never before been possible to see. In fact, the Blu-Ray release shows for the first time the incredible film quality achieved at the time of filming, and with little exaggeration it can be said that few television shows, particularly those of this era, but in truth, any television show prior to the advent of high definition, will reveal this level of detail. Tweed suits show every stich. Every piece of hair seemingly stands out on its own. Books, photos, and nicknacks on the wall are readable (ever wondered who those names were on the board outside of Rob's office? Now you can easily tell ...). The whole show seems almost to pop out in three dimensional reality. If you're a Dick van Dyke aficionado, this set is completely worth the re-purchase (give your DVD set to a young person to whom you would like to share Dick van Dyke). If you've never purchased the DVD's, then get these instead. Amazing.",1219795200,7,7830,4.572649572649572

If you were a fan of this show, or just a fan of good sitcoms that are always G rated, you will love this set. A lot of money for DVDs but to own the entire series of a show is great and this show ended after only 5 years before they ran out of good ideas.",1208736000,3,554,3.7435897435897436
2068371,5,B00028G748,"I was too young in 1961-66 to watch this on it's first run, but when syndication re-ran the show, I gave up a lot of baseball, playing Army and catching frogs to watch every episode. Two reasons, it was absolutely hilarious and fullfill my boyhood crush on Mary Tyler Moore, WHAT A MOM!

The show was comic genius Carl Reiner's brainchild that almost never happened. Reiner approached the ""powers-that-be"" with a pilot called ""Head of the Family"" that failed completely. Fortunately, executive producer Danny Thomas (who was gaining success with ""The Andy Griffith Show"") saw the potential. He and co-producer Sheldon Leonard revamped the show and television history was made. But believe it or not, after all the critical acclaim of the first season, it was almost cancelled. Thomas and Leonard were able convince the ""powers-that-be"" to renew it.

As we all know, the show centered around the life of a television comedy writer working for the Alan Brady Show and gave good insight on the TV show developement process. This was based on Reiner's own experience working on the 1950's show ""Your Show of Shows"".

The casting was a bit difficult, Reiner still wanted to be the lead role of Rob Petrie. Thomas and Leonard thought Dick Van Dyke was a better choice for his wirey and agile frame to give the show good physical humor. Jim Carrey has been known to state that Van Dyke was a big influence on him. Then there's the role of the woman behind the man, Laura (called Laurie in the first episode) Petrie. The unknown Mary Tyler Moore made Laura Petrie one of most eyecatching moms in TV. Along with young boys like me, I can lay odds a lot of daddy's across the country were raising eyebrows over those capri slacks as well (Honey, we're going shopping for those slacks!)

The supporting cast was just as stellar. Morey Amsterdam, a radio and TV veteran, was brought in as the quick-witted co-writer Buddy Sorrell. Rose Marie provided the single woman Sally Rogers, another co-writer who seems to have a problem getting a man regardless how attractive she is! Reiner was able to secure an often recurring role as the egomaniacal fictional TV star Alan Brady with hilarious results. In the first and second seasons Reiner insisted on keeping his back to the camera sans toupee. Also, his voice can be heard in various TV and radio commercial parodies throughout the show's run whenever the characters are watching or listening to the said medium.

The show made sitcoms more sophisticated not with just good clever humor, but also would touch on some rather controversial issues at the time. Episodes dealt with things like the Petrie's son Richie using profanity, asking about ""the facts of life"" (to him, Mr. Cabbage is responsible for bringing babies!). Racism was another topic when Rob and Laura were asked to attend an NAACP type organization banquet after accidently dying their hands black. Then there's the flashback episode when Rob thought they had the wrong baby after Ritchie was born and the couple that was mistaken for turned out to be African-American. The list goes on.

The show was also great for lampooning current social and cultural trends. The episode that really brought on Moore's comedic talents was when Laura decides to dye her hair blonde. With Marilyn gone and Jayne's career tanking, blondes at this point in American culture were phasing out in favor of brunettes as seen by other movie and TV starlets like Audrey Hepburn, Stephanie Powers, Dawn Wells and Marlo Thomas. Considered one of the most popular episodes was ""It May Look Like A Walnut"" that spoofed the wave of low-budget sci-fi films going on at the time. Then when the British Invasion brought on by The Beatles hit, the show guested real life British singing duo Chad and Jeremy as the fictional Redcoats who appear on the Alan Brady Show. Again, the list goes on.

Another aspect of the show's appeal was the reflection that Rob and Laura had on the newly elected Mr. and Mrs. First Family, Jack and Jackie Kennedy. Moore's fashions and hairstyles were almost identical to that of Jackie's. Not to mention, there was a constant sexual chemistry between the two despite the usual seperate beds. This was highlighted by an episode where Laura gets her toe stuck in the bathtub faucet and Rob is in there with her thinking it's funny. You know she's naked, but of course it's never mentioned and Rob walks out attempting to explain to the hotel detective saying ""Hey, you want to see something funny?"" then immediatley composes himself and blocks the doorway!

All in all, the Dick Van Dyke Show was the All in the Family of the 60s. It raised the bar on sitcoms and continued it's influence to later shows like Mad About You (where Reiner himself reprised his role of Alan Brady). Reiner never intended for the show to run more than five seasons making it one of the few shows to end at the top of it's game.",1207612800,3,4907,4.771495877502945

I am just old enough to have watched and enjoyed this show as a child when it originally aired on the network and I remember how sad I was when it ended.  Of course, I have watched it in reruns ever since, to the point where I have every episode almost completely memorized!  I now own the DVD set of the complete series, which I received as a birthday gift just a couple of months ago, and I am already playing through it a second time.  It's wonderful to be able to watch ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" any time I want and the speacial features are great, too - interviews with cast and producers, commentary, clips from Emmy Awards shows and some other very interesting and entertaining footage.

This show never loses its interest for me, rather it seems to get better and better with each viewing and it still has me smiling wide and laughing out loud.  Several episodes stand out as classics and some have always been particular favorites of mine, two or three episodes lack the usual originality and sparkle, but in all five seasons there isn't one episode that doesn't offer something to make it worth watching.  The writing, the direction, the entire cast - with their many talents, their singing and dancing, their comedic skills and timing, and the chemistry among them - are all way off the charts!  Carl Reiner - in creating and writing this series based on his own life experience as a comedy writer, husband and father - has imbued his characters with incomparable warmth, human frailty and emotional honesty, making them all nearly as believable and lovable as they are hilariously funny.  I have to say that the ""The Dick Van Dyke"" show touches my heart as much as it makes me laugh and it NEVER insults my intelligence or sensibility in any way.  That is why I can watch it over and over and over again...year after year after year...

There have been many great television sitcoms, but as far as I'm concerned ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" tops them all in every respect!  I only wish there were more episodes to enjoy, but I applaud the decision to quit when they did rather than risk growing stale.

My husband and I, and our families, first watched Dick Van Dyke and company when it was on network television in the 60's. Believe me, my husband bears a striking resemblnce to Van Dyke with all the wonderful character traits of Robert Simpson Petrie included. (It took a while to find him, but I knew I was on the right track when he said he loved TDVDS, too. And he's a writer!!) We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Carl Reiner, his genius, and his beloved wife Estelle, for modelling a really good marriage. Forty years later we're still following the example. As we rewatch these gems we are amazed at how many of the mannerism and traits have become our own.

 Catch phrases like ""keys and parrots"" and ""I do? I don't?"" and ""He looked like Danny Thomas"" and ""Oh, Rob"" were enough to start a giggle, then a full blown discussion of the show in question. We even had a dog who could have been ""Horrible's"" sister.

For an interesting read about ""behind the scenes,"" reference ""The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book"" by Vince Waldron. It's full of all sorts of goodies like the fact that Laura (MTM) really did make that pool shot in ""Hustling the Hustler"" and it was only through the cast's professionalism that they kept in character so the shot could be used.

This Complete-Series set, which was originally released on May 24, 2005, holds all five seasons of the perpetually-entertaining Van Dyke Show, with all episodes having been restored and remastered by Image Entertainment and Paul Brownstein Productions. Each episode exhibits excellent video and audio quality. And every single program is complete and unedited. The average running time is a shade more than 25 minutes per show.

Each of the twenty-five single-sided discs gets its own individual slim plastic case. Each case has unique cover art, featuring a different publicity still photo on the front.

The 25 discs in this Mega-Set are placed side-by-side inside a large outer ""slipcase"" box. Image Entertainment distributed five separate season-by-season ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" DVD boxed sets in 2003 and 2004, with each of those sets coming with a 5-Disc slipcase box. However, those separate seasonal slipcases are not included in this Mega-Set.

Gobs of supplemental bonus features are also included on these twenty-five DVDs, including: Audio Commentary Tracks on several episodes (sporting the voices of Dick Van Dyke, Carl Reiner, Rose Marie, and others), along with cast interviews, vintage 1960s TV commercials, documentaries, featurettes, Emmy Award video clips, photo galleries, behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage, trivia games, CBS-TV promos, some hidden Easter Eggs to seek out, and lots of other little interesting extra tidbits besides!

There are even full-length TV-show bonuses included on selected discs, including a complete episode of ""The Danny Thomas Show"" (which has Morey Amsterdam popping up as his Van Dyke Show character, ""Buddy Sorrell"").

Other complete TV-show extras include the original Pilot episode for the Van Dyke series; plus a full-length 46-minute CBS-TV Van Dyke Show documentary made in the mid-1990s; and an absolutely-outstanding and ultra-fun-to-watch episode of a 1962 television game show entitled ""Stump The Stars"" (aka: ""Mike Stokey's Pantomime Quiz""), which has several Van Dyke Show cast members playing a lively charades game. Great, great fun!

A nicely-constructed 12-page booklet, packed with interesting info about the series, is also a part of this Dick Van Dyke Show DVD-Video bonanza too. The booklet also includes several photos of the cast and crew (with some of the pictures being printed in color).

Note Re. Bonus Features --- Rest assured that every bonus item that can be found on the five individual DVD season sets can also be located within this ""All Five Seasons"" monster set as well. The discs in this mega-collection are identical to those found in the individual sets.

Coming up next here at ""Dick Van Dyke Central"" is my Mega Episode List -- i.e., a look at all 158 Van Dyke programs (plus the Pilot) that can be found at your digital fingertips within this gigantic 5-Season DVD collection.

I've laid out this Program Guide in the same order in which the episodes are arranged on the 25 DVDs, which is a ""Film Date"" order (instead of the ""Air Date"" chronology). The original CBS-TV air dates have also been mentioned in my list below, plus I've added in some selected program descriptions, anecdotes, and funny dialogue for many of my favorite shows.

If you begin to suffer from a slight case of ""Van Dyke Show Overload"" before you're able to finish reading the following tome/guide, I can fully understand. In such a case, stop reading at once and then take two walnuts from Laura's egg carton and wash them down with a glass of fresh air. You should feel better shortly. ~sheepish grin~

""Head Of The Family"" (Pilot Episode) -- Starring Carl Reiner in the role of Rob Petrie. Featuring Barbara Britton as Laura, Morty Gunty as Buddy Sorrell, and Sylvia Miles as Sally Rogers.

""Head Of The Family"" was filmed in early December of 1958, but it didn't get its one and only network television airing until more than a year-and-a-half later, when CBS aired it on Tuesday, July 19, 1960.

----------------------------------------------

""THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW"" FULL-SERIES EPISODE LIST:

SEASON #1 (1961-1962):

1. The Sick Boy And The Sitter (First Aired: 10/3/61) .... The premiere episode of the series does a fine job of introducing America to Rob and Laura Petrie (and company). Young son Ritchie is a little under the weather, and Laura senses that something bad is about to happen at home when she reluctantly agrees to attend a party with Rob at Alan Brady's house.

The assorted talents of Dick Van Dyke, Morey Amsterdam, and Rose Marie are put on display during the ""party"" scene at Alan's house. Mary Tyler Moore's considerable dancing and comedic (and crying) talents, however, aren't fully realized in this debut show; but those MTM traits shine through nicely in the episodes soon to follow.

Ritchie Petrie (played by 5-year-old Larry Mathews) is given numerous funny lines in this pilot program, and he's never cuter than in this first episode of the series. .... ""Do I feel hungry, mommy?""

2. The Meerschatz Pipe (11/28/61) .... ""I sound this way because my wife thinks I've got a cold.""

3. Jealousy! (11/7/61) .... A first-rate episode, highlighting Laura's insecurities when Rob has to work late at the office with a beautiful female, ""Valerie Blake"", who is guest-starring on ""The Alan Brady Show"". .... ""You've been very busy blakely!""

4. Sally And The Lab Technician (10/17/61) .... ""I can't remember when I laughed that much. I found myself laughing out loud -- right out loud!""

5. Washington vs. The Bunny (10/24/61)

6. Oh How We Met The Night That We Danced (10/31/61) .... A great flashback episode, the first of many such ""Let's Go Back In Time"" shows, detailing how Rob and Laura first met while Rob was in the Army.

7. The Unwelcome House Guest (11/21/61)

8. Harrison B. Harding Of Camp Crowder, Mo. (11/6/61) .... One of my all-time favorite episodes. When Harrison B. Harding drops by for a visit, Rob can't seem to remember who this guy is. To his later embarrassment, Rob calls the police on Mr. Harding after deciding Harrison might be some kind of shady character. .... ""Give me a napkin, quick! -- Tomato juice in my ear.""

Just after the hilarious ""tomato juice in my ear"" portion of this episode, watch carefully as Rob ever-so-gently places the glass back onto the exact same part of the wall where he had it previously. (It must have left a 'ring', and Rob didn't want to create a second such ring. LOL!)

9. My Blonde-Haired Brunette (10/10/61) .... This extremely-funny episode has Laura deciding to dye her hair blonde in order to spice up her marriage. But she soon regrets that decision. .... ""I told you, I never dyed before!"" .... ""And the GRAY HAIR!!"" :)

10. Forty-Four Tickets (12/5/61) .... Rob's faulty memory causes him some problems in this episode (44 problems to be precise). Watch for Rob's/Dick's outstanding (and seemingly-effortless) head-over-heels pratfall at the very beginning of this show.

11. To Tell Or Not To Tell (11/14/61) .... ""Can I just say something? Va-va-va-voom!""

12. Sally Is A Girl (12/19/61)

13. Empress Carlotta's Necklace (12/12/61) .... This episode is a favorite of mine. It features just about everything that makes this TV series so fabulous and timeless and charming -- e.g., great ""natural"" humor brought out by life's ordinary occurrences, plus the genuinely-heartfelt tenderness and love that exists between the two main characters (Rob and Laura Petrie). We can really feel Laura's sincerity in the scene where she apologizes to Rob for having suggested giving the necklace to Rob's mom.

Gavin MacLeod puts in a very funny performance here as Mel Cooley's jewelry-selling cousin, ""Maxwell"", who (like Mel) is bald as a cue ball. .... ""You see, Maxwell doesn't have any overhead."" --> ""Kind of runs in the family, don't it?""

14. Buddy, Can You Spare A Job? (12/26/61)

15. Who Owes Who What? (1/24/62)

16. Sol And The Sponsor (4/11/62) .... ""You're both named Henry? That's crazy!""

17. The Curious Thing About Women (1/10/62) .... A classic. A first-class script, a curious female named Laura, and lots of very funny moments. .... ""Honey, did a package come for me?""

18. Punch Thy Neighbor (1/17/62) .... Another fave, with Jerry Paris (as neighbor Jerry Helper) playing a major role here. Frank Adamo, frequently seen in small bit parts throughout the series, pops up again in this episode. He plays the ""Singing-Telegram Messenger"", and he gets to read (sing) a very funny rhyming message sent to Rob by the wisecracking Jerry. ....

""Robert Petrie wrote a show,

Supposed to be funny, ho-ho-ho;

Look how far this man has gotten,

Writing shows that are really rotten!""

~LOL!~

19. Where Did I Come From? (1/3/62) .... Rob's physical humor is a highlight of this flashback show. The ""Perfectly-Placed Hat On The Bedboard"" scene is always worth a big laugh, no matter how many times you've seen it. .... ""Oh, I really need my pants today, Rob; I'm having lunch with the sponsor.""

20. The Boarder Incident (2/14/62)

21. A Word A Day (2/7/62)

22. The Talented Neighborhood (1/31/62) .... Watch for Rob's nifty ""tiger pajamas"" in this show.

23. Father Of The Week (2/21/62)

24. The Twizzle (2/28/62)

25. One Angry Man (3/7/62) .... A proverbial ""lone juror holdout"" episode. Rob, naturally, is the only juror voting ""not guilty"". The scenes in the courtroom highlight this show. .... ""What's the matter with the way I ogled her?""

26. Where You Been, Fassbinder? (3/14/62)

27. The Bad Old Days (4/4/62) .... ""Why don't you wash your hair?! You disgust me!!""

28. I Am My Brother's Keeper (3/21/62) * .... Jerry Van Dyke makes his first of several funny appearances as Rob's brother ""Stacey"".

29. The Sleeping Brother (3/28/62) *

30. The Return Of Happy Spangler (4/18/62) .... Season One concludes with more first-rate physical humor from Dick Van Dyke. In lesser-talented hands, Rob's ""lecture on comedy"" would not have been nearly as funny. But Dick has that magic ""something"" that can turn a scene that might otherwise be ""ordinary"" into pure comic gold.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SEASON #2 (1962-1963):

31. Never Name A Duck (9/26/62)

32. The Two Faces Of Rob (10/3/62) .... I love this particular episode. Rob's telephone gag aimed at Laura backfires on him, and large quantities of hilarity follow. .... ""Like you said mommy, 'dolce far niente'!""

33. Bank Book 6565696 (10/17/62) .... ""A 378-dollar sports shirt?""

34. The Attempted Marriage (10/10/62)

35. Hustling The Hustler (10/24/62)

36. What's In A Middle Name? (11/7/62) .... Ritchie discovers why he's been saddled with the middle name of ""Rosebud"". .... ""If it's a boy, 'Ulysses David'; if it's a girl, 'Ulyssia Davida'!""

37. My Husband Is Not A Drunk (10/31/62) .... ""Oh, Doctor Zorba! Just because I disobeyed you, you didn't have to cut off all your hair!!""

38. Like A Sister (11/14/62)

39. The Night The Roof Fell In (11/21/62) .... Another flashback show, featuring different versions of a rare fight between Rob and Laura. .... ""Why don't you fix yourself up?!""

40. The Secret Life Of Buddy And Sally (11/28/62) .... ""I gotta no -- slike a ban -- anna."" --> ""Now say the whole thing."" --> ""I gotta nose like a banana.""

41. A Bird In The Head Hurts (12/5/62)

42. Gesundheit, Darling (12/12/62) .... Another extremely funny show from the desk of creator Carl Reiner. Rob can't stop sneezing, and Laura thinks SHE is the cause. Keep the rewind button handy when Rob comes home after a sneeze-free day at the office, only to immediately start sneezing after one kiss to Laura's cheek. ~Huge LOL Moment!~

43. A Man's Teeth Are Not His Own (12/19/62) .... Rob busts a tooth and his dentist (Jerry Helper) is out of town. It's quite a dilemma for poor Rob. One of the top highlights here is when Mel gives Rob some ice water when Rob is in severe pain from his broken tooth. Rob's reaction is worth at least one replay.

44. Somebody Has To Play Cleopatra (12/26/62) .... Bob Crane puts in a humorous guest appearance. .... ""Once I get the 'hemlet' on Rob."" .... ""Harry!! GET IN THE CAR!!!""

45. The Cat Burglar (1/2/63) .... This episode features one of the very best scenes in the whole series -- the scene where the musical jewelry box seems to be hooked up to the bedroom door, with Rob quickly closing the door as he looks around, wondering where in the world that music's coming from. It's a brilliant comedy moment that demands multiple instant replays every time this episode is cued up.

46. The Foul-Weather Girl (1/9/63)

47. Will You Two Be My Wife? (1/16/63)

48. Ray Murdock's X-Ray (1/23/63) .... This is one of my very favorite shows in the series. Rob is interviewed on TV and reveals some not-too-flattering details about wife Laura. .... ""Rob, go to your room!""

49. I Was A Teenage Head Writer (1/30/63)

50. My Husband Is A Check-Grabber (2/13/63) .... Time for some more (funny) flashback sequences. This is yet another dandy episode that makes this TV series so immeasurably ""re-watchable"". And we also get a rare look at the Petrie's car.

51. It May Look Like A Walnut (2/6/63) .... A classic among classics here, with Danny Thomas popping up in Rob and Laura's dreams as ""Kolac"" from the planet ""Twilo"" (serving as a spoof and a tribute to the series ""The Twilight Zone""). Keep an eye on your thumbs.

52. Don't Trip Over That Mountain (2/20/63) .... Despite Laura's warnings, ""klutz"" Rob goes skiing. Guess what happens?

53. Give Me Your Walls (2/27/63)

54. The Sam Pomerantz Scandals (3/6/63)

55. I'm No Henry Walden (3/27/63) .... Everett Sloane puts in a guest appearance here. And watch for Carl Reiner, not as ""Alan Brady"", but as ""Yale Sampson"", a mush-mouth intellectual who (as Rob puts it) has the ability to say things that ""seem vague, but are in reality...meaningless"". ~LOL~

56. The Square Triangle (3/20/63)

57. Racy Tracy Rattigan (4/3/63) .... Richard Dawson is ""Racy Tracy"", a skirt-chasing British playboy who gets ""such a kick out of seeing irate husbands"".

58. Divorce (4/10/63) .... Buddy's wife, ""Pickles"", takes center stage here. And she's a howl in this episode, too, as she tries to explain who ""Floyd B. Barriscale"" and ""Barton Nelson"" are.

59. It's A Shame She Married Me (4/17/63) .... Robert Vaughn guest stars as ""Jim Darling"", a former beau of Laura's. .... ""Are you coming, Cooley?"" --> ""Yes, Darling. Er, uh, I mean Jim!"" :)

60. A Surprise Surprise Is A Surprise (4/24/63) .... Laura tries her best to surprise Rob on his birthday -- and she does just that. Watch this fun episode and find out how she manages it.

61. Jilting The Jilter (5/1/63)

62. When A Bowling Pin Talks, Listen (5/8/63) .... ""There aren't too many funny bits we can lift from 'The Telephone Hour'.""

63. All About Eavesdropping (10/23/63) .... This episode actually aired during the third season, but was filmed as the ""head start"" ep. at the end of Season 2. ""Eavesdropping"" ranks as one of my all-time favorite shows in the 5-year history of the series. The hysterical ""On The Street Where You Live"" charades game is sure to put you on the floor. .... ""It was perfectly clear to me Gerald."" .... ""You mean you didn't give 'em the house?"" :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SEASON #3 (1963-1964):

64. That's My Boy?? (9/25/63) .... The third season begins in fine fashion, with another top-flight episode, which tells the story of what happens when new father Rob Petrie's imagination starts working overtime after bringing baby Ritchie home from a very hectic hospital.

65. The Masterpiece (10/2/63) .... This terrific episode features a chipped ""Artanis"", a funny auction, Howard Morris as a kooky-acting art expert, and ""The Thing"".

66. Laura's Little Lie (10/9/63) *

67. Very Old Shoes, Very Old Rice (10/16/63) * .... This two-parter (""Lie"" and ""Rice"") serves as double the Van Dyke fun after we find out why it is that Laura seems to be avoiding the insurance man.

68. Uncle George (11/13/63) .... Denver Pyle pops up as Rob's ""Uncle George"". The standout parts of this show are the scenes with Herman Glimsher's overbearing mother. .... ""Rob's uncle wanted to meet some nice lady."" --> ""We couldn't find any, so we invited your mother."" ~LOL!~

69. Too Many Stars (10/30/63)

70. Who And Where Was Antonio Stradivarius? (11/6/63) .... A crack over the head with a violin sends Rob to Red Hook (in New Jersey) with a case of amnesia. .... ""I left my raisin cake in Red Hook!""

71. Big Max Calvada (11/20/63) .... A spoof on gangster movies is on tap in this fun episode. Sheldon Leonard pokes some fun at himself when he shows up in Rob's office as ""Maxwell Calvada"", a no-nonsense shady character who wants a big favor from Rob's writing staff -- or else! LOL. .... ""Well, I'd call the police, but I don't know what to tell 'em.""

72. The Ballad Of The Betty Lou (11/27/63) .... A day at sea for Rob and Jerry turns out to be no day at the beach. .... ""I don't know how sheep stand each other in the rainy season.""

73. Turtles, Ties And Toreadors (12/4/63) .... Rob hires a maid to help out an overworked Laura. But there are a few problems, not the least of which is the fact that one of her arms is in a sling! .... ""Which arm?"" --> ""Well, maybe she's left-handed even."" :)

74. The Sound Of The Trumpets Of Conscience Falls Deafly

On A Brain That Holds Its Ears... (12/11/63)

75. The Third One From The Left (1/1/64)

76. The Alan Brady Show Presents (12/18/63) .... The one and only Christmas-themed show in the entire series. .... ""We all are fine musicians; we practice every day...""

77. My Husband Is The Best One (1/8/64)

78. Happy Birthday And Too Many More (2/5/64) .... One of the very few episodes that wasn't filmed in front of a live studio audience (the Christmas show, filmed just two weeks earlier, is another). Canned laughter is used here. The reason for that being: this ""Happy Birthday"" episode was filmed on November 26, 1963, just one day after America buried its assassinated President, John F. Kennedy.

79. The Lady And The Tiger And The Lawyer (1/15/64) .... ""We always have a little coffee and cake before dinner.""

80. The Life And Love Of Joe Coogan (1/22/64) .... Rob bumps into an old flame of Laura's on the golf course. It's another very solid entry in the life of this series, with the epilogue scene rising to the level of pure ""brilliance"", IMHO. The show's last line (""You lost him to a better man""), spoken just perfectly by Rob/Dick, wraps up this episode in impeccably-classy fashion.

81. A Nice, Friendly Game Of Cards (1/29/64) .... Yep, this is yet another classic episode. Edward Platt guests as ""Lou Gregory"", who accuses Rob of cheating during a ""nice, friendly game of cards"" at the Petrie house. Funny stuff here. This is a rare episode that features no ""work"" scenes filmed from the ""writer's room"". .... ""That IS my new 'system' -- ante up, take two cards, and fold."" ~grin~

82. The Brave And The Backache (2/12/64)

83. The Pen Is Mightier Than The Mouth (2/19/64) *

84. My Part-Time Wife (2/26/64) *

85. Honeymoons Are For The Lucky (3/4/64) .... Another flashback show, revealing the details of Rob's unorthodox honeymoon.

86. How To Spank A Star (3/11/64)

87. The Plots Thicken (3/18/64) .... Rob and Laura become a ""two-plot family"" in this delightful episode with an unusual ""plot""-line (all about cemetery plots, golf courses, several angry parents, and Buddy's funny ""Home Food Plan"").

88. Scratch My Car And Die (3/25/64) .... Rob gets a new ""Tarantula"" (a car, not the other icky thing) and can't seem to ever get a chance to drive it himself. And when Laura scratches the ""bug"", Rob is fit to be tied. .... ""Oh, honey, I meant to remind ya -- don't park that car under a tree, or a bird.""

89. The Return Of Edwin Carp (4/1/64) .... ""Oh, hot boiling drats, mother wants her cocoa!""

90. October Eve (4/8/64) .... Is it okay to use the word ""classic"" yet again? I hope so. Because it applies here. When an embarrassingly-""raw"" painting of Laura shows up in a popular art gallery, it causes considerable grief for the painting's subject and her husband. .... ""You're not gonna have another {baby}, are ya?"" --> ""Oh Rob! Would Sally call and tell ME that?!""

91. Dear Mrs. Petrie, Your Husband Is In Jail (4/15/64)

92. My Neighbor's Husband's Other Life (4/22/64) .... ""Look, honey, when a man is out on the town he doesn't go around telling girls he's married -- forget what I said!""

93. I'd Rather Be Bald Than Have No Head At All (4/29/64) .... Rob finds 28 hairs in the wash basin one morning and is convinced he's going bald -- fast! .... ""How did I get a head of lettuce?!"" --> ""Well, if you use salad dressing, you can't expect to grow meat loaf!"" :)

94. Teacher's Petrie (5/13/64)

95. My Two Show-Offs And Me (12/16/64)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SEASON #4 (1964-1965):

96. My Mother Can Beat Up My Father (9/23/64) .... The Season-Four opener has Rob tangling with a stuffed monkey -- and losing the battle.

97. The Ghost Of A. Chantz (9/30/64) .... This spooky and hilarious entry has Rob and the gang staying at a ""haunted"" cabin and having the collective daylights scared out of them. .... ""All that's missing now is Vincent Price!""

98. The Lady And The Baby Sitter (10/7/64)

99. A Vigilante Ripped My Sports Coat (10/14/64)

100. The Man From 'Emperor' (10/21/64)

101. Romance, Roses And Rye Bread (10/28/64)

102. 4-And-A-Half (11/4/64) * .... Don Rickles puts in a very funny appearance as ""Lyle Francis Delp"", a rather inept crook. .... ""You mean you've held up people in elevators before?"" --> ""No, I held 'em up in front of a police station, dum-dum!"" ~LOL~

103. The Alan Brady Show Goes To Jail (11/11/64) * .... ""Is this the underwear of a criminal?!!""

104. Three Letters From One Wife (11/18/64)

105. It Wouldn't Hurt Them To Give Us A Raise (12/2/64) .... ""Did you know that Alan Brady's mother-in-law pays the band?""

106. Pink Pills And Purple Parents (11/25/64) .... One of the best shows from Season 4, as a few pink pills have Laura acting very strangely when she meets Rob's parents for the first time. MTM was never funnier. .... ""One for moo-moo!"" .... ""Gonna have a little music, moo-moo, oh yes!""

107. The Death Of The Party (12/9/64) .... Rob tries his best to hide the fact he is sick the same night Laura is giving a dinner party. .... ""Al Jolson, the Jazz Singer!!""

108. Stretch Petrie vs. Kid Schenk (12/30/64)

109. The Impractical Joke (1/13/65) .... Buddy enlists a friend to play a phone gag on Rob. In the days that follow, Buddy is worried sick that a whopper of a joke is about to come his way in retaliation. A great episode. .... ""Now there may be a little dust on your 'loud-soft'.""

110. Brother, Can You Spare $2500? (1/6/65) .... ""Excuse me, is that the 'Louie Wexler' water fountain?"" --> ""I don't know; but ANYBODY can drink from it.""

111. Stacey Petrie - Part 1 (1/20/65) *

112. Stacey Petrie - Part 2 (1/27/65) *

113. The Redcoats Are Coming (2/10/65) .... A very rare ""time-stamped"" type of episode, as the Van Dyke Show writers cash in on the '60s ""Beatles"" craze. .... This show also includes an odd line in the script for Buddy (Morey), when he claims to have been a teenager when Frank Sinatra was in his height of ""teen idol"" status. Only problem there is: Buddy/(Morey) is seven years OLDER than Mr. Sinatra. Oh, well. .... BTW, don't forget the password (""Paul Revere"").

114. Boy #1, Boy #2 (2/3/65)

115. The Case Of The Pillow (2/17/65) .... Ed Begley appears as a court judge in this extremely-funny episode. Rob gets to play a variation of ""Perry Mason"" here, too, which adds to the hilarity. .... ""It's not your fault, Mr. Petrie. It's television. You think you're a lawyer; I think I'm a doctor.""

116. Young Man With A Shoehorn (2/24/65) .... ""I'd like to try them a half-a-size smaller."" --> ""Smaller?"" --> ""Smaller.""

117. Girls Will Be Boys (3/3/65)

118. Bupkis (3/10/65) .... Watch for the ""phone book goof"" made by Rob/Dick, when he dials a phone number BEFORE looking it up in the book. ;)

119. Your Home Sweet Home Is My Home (3/17/65) .... That great-big rock in Rob's basement is causing a few problems in this flashback program. .... ""There's plenty of room for a pool table right over here"" --> ""Oh sure, if we use chopsticks for cues.""

120. Anthony Stone (3/24/65) .... Sally's dating a mortician, and she's not exactly dying to tell any of her friends. .... ""It was nice meeting you."" --> ""Of course."" --> ""Of course??""

121. Never Bathe On Saturday (3/31/65) .... This very memorable ep. centers around Laura's toe. Many moments in this program are worthy of multiple (and immediate) replays. .... ""Don't toy with me, you saucy wench."" .... ""She gets stuck in the bathroom, he paints on mustaches; they're a great match.""

122. One Hundred Terrible Hours (5/5/65)

123. Show Of Hands (4/14/65) .... ""Nothing goes over worse at a formal dinner than the smell of sweaty bunny fur."" ~LOL!~

124. Baby Fat (4/21/65)

----------------------------------------------

Pull out any of these 25 discs and you'll have some great television entertainment. Via this amazing boxed set, a viewer has instant access to all of Rob Petrie's physical comedy bits, along with every one of Laura Petrie's ""crying jags"" (Mary Tyler Moore's sobbing routines are hard to top).

And don't forget about all those ""Buddy insults Mel"" gags (which must number in the hundreds over the course of the series) -- not to mention Dick Van Dyke's uncanny ability to act out a ""one-way telephone conversation"" (which always amazes me when I see him do this -- and there are many such ""telephone"" moments during the series).

Just suffice it to say that I love this television series. Its humor is timeless, the characters never seem phony, and the writing is remarkable. And you'll be able to see why when you pop in any of these Digital Discs.

To sum it all up -- ""THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW: THE COMPLETE SERIES"" DVD collection is, without fear of argument, a ""complete treasure"".

I'm done now. :)",1155168000,72,30343,4.836529149719156
2068383,5,B00028G748,"Although I was too young to see the Dick Van Dyke Show when it aired originally, I've enjoyed the re-runs on satellite TV for years.

I bought a few of the ""best of"" DVD's from a department store and, much to my surprise, my 7 year old son loves the show, too! So when I saw the complete series out on DVD, I immediately put it on my Amazon WishList.

Once our tax refund came in, guess what I purchased?

My son and I LOVE this box set! There are 5 seasons, and each season has 5 discs which are in their own slim case (157 episodes in all). Each case features 6 or 7 episodes that are color coded. All the Disc 1's are blue/green, all of Disc 2's are red, all of Disc 3's are dark blue, etc. A black and white scene from one of the episodes are on the front of each case, as well. There's also a neat holographic insert that comes with the series.

I happened to see an episode on TV the other day, and what struck me was how much better the quality of the DVD's are! They really cleaned up the episodes for the DVD box set. I could tell a bit of fuzziness on the TV version.

Each episode is numbered and titled with original film/air dates and a brief synopsis...making it easy to find your favorite episodes. Although I haven't finished watching them all yet, my favorite is the one with Dick Van Dyke's real life brother...who plays Rob's brother Stacy in several episodes. The sleepwalking ones with the banjo are HILARIOUS. To this day, when I see them, I laugh so hard I cry!

Other great features are different vignettes, interviews and behind-the-scenes moments--such as Dick Van Dyke singing the theme song (you didn't know there were words to the song, did ya?), an interview with Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore about ""the good ol' days"", and other intersting show elements. (It was wild to see ""Millie"" as an older woman talking about the show...still having that whiny voice!)

Highly recommended if you're a fan of the show!",1143417600,32,1944,4.3535911602209945
2068384,5,B00028G748,"I have been and still am a huge fan of Dick Van Dyke.  I was born in 1961 and have watched the reruns of The DVD Show all of my life and anyone who knows me, knows that I've been waiting for years for this to come out on VHS/DVD!!  I have checked Amazon.com periodically to see if it was out yet and finally in January, my dream came true!!!  I ordered it immediately.  The series is as great as I remember it in the reruns!!  I loved being able to watch the episodes in my own home and at my own convenience.  And will continue to watch The DVD Show for years to come.  And even though there are several/most episodes that I have literally memorized everyone's lines, I NEVER get tired of watching The DVD Show.  The slap stick humor of Dick Van Dyke, and how well that Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke play off of each other.  And not to mention the rest of the gang, Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, Richard Deacon, Jerry Paris, Ann Guilbert, and Larry Matthews.  Now, I wish they would put Diagnosis Murder on DVD!!

Even comes with a little book about each actor and fact of about the show and how it started. Great quality, Thanks a bunch!!",1520467200,,576,4.052631578947368
