7895598,5,6305799032,"I remember watching this on SciFi a few years back. I was so astonished at what I saw I completely forgot I was cooking dinner and nearly burned my house down!

The footage on this tape is completely amazing. I've seen it three times since watching in SciFi, and even though I am a little dissapointed that none of the events were actually filmed other than the plasma dripping from the walls, I am convinced this is actual footage of one of the most violent poltergeists to ever make itself known. It's a must-see for paranormal enthusiasts!",1178755200,,542,4.587628865979381
7895599,1,6305799032,"I have seen this documentary on the Sci-Fi channel a few months ago, and I was just speechless totally convinced it was true.  I have since then even began ghost hunting myself.  Let me just say this first...I do believe in ghosts.  So I ordered the video for my own library.  There are some parts that do seem genuine to me, however after watching this video more and more I can't help but notice some inconsistencies.  For starters,  I thought that camera equipment ( particularly the video camera) would not work up in the attic.  However, later on in the video,  two of the research team men are giving their stories about an event that happened, all the while this is being recorded in the attic?  I also found it questionable that there is never actually any phenomenon caught on tape.  For example, things dropping on the stove, objects flying across the room,  always too late for the camera man to get it on tape.  Jackie Hernandez herself made a statement that there was always a man walking around her house with his camera AT ALL TIMES!  However, the ""good stuff"" was never actually seen as it happened.  Why wasn't the seance (spelling?) recorded.  Wouldn't that have been good documentation, especially since Barry was thrown up against the wall.  And who lights a fire in a small trailor?  Also, I think the footage of the ghost at Barry's house was just complete overkill, with so much happening couldn't someone have gotten just ONE actual event as it happened?  Not just afterwards?  And finally, but most importantly, the other night I was up very late watching TV and ran across a movie called The Switchblade Sisters.  Lace, the leader of the gang, credited as Robbie Lee at the end of the movie should does look like a very young Jackie Hernandez!  This disappointed me greatly as I have hoped very much that the account of the San Perdo haunting was real.

7895600,4,6305799032,"I remember watching this documentary on SCFI's ""Declassified Tuesdays"" a while back.  It looked rather interesting.  After watching it, I was in awe!  The same people who investigated the infamous ""Entity"" case years later encountered a force just like their pervious case, but stronger and more frightening.  The difference between the two cases, is that in this case, the force literally triedd to serious injure and try to kill one of their crew memeers, due to the fact that crew member looked exactly like the force's killer!  What was also interesting was that the force not only effected the woman who lived in the home, but otheres close to her, which would include the crew members.  Following them home causing havoc and destruction, as you will see in the documentary.  Like the Entity, I really think this should be a movie, this will sure give one chills just viewing it.",1074816000,2,884,4.8533333333333335
7895601,5,6305799032,"Also known as the ""Haunting of Jackie Hernandez"", it's a wonderful documentary -- and probably one of the best.  If you love ghosts, but are tired of the hokey documentaries with lame re-enactments, this documentary is definately for you.
Jackie is a woman with two small children who is bothered by a ghostly visitor -- and who isn't very friendly.  She ends up calling paranormal experts -- the same experts who were involved in the what was later known in the movie ""The Entity"".
This movie is occasionally creepy -- and downright scary at some moments.  What's great about Unknown Encounter is that you actually get to *see* and *hear* the footage that they managed to capture.  That's a downright rarity.
How's this for a teaser:  the ghost (1) does something to a baby (don't worry, baby's ok); (2) attempts to murder one of the ghost hunters; and (3) *follows them out of the house* -- and that's just for starters.
Blood dripping from the walls a la Amityville Horror?  Theatrics.  Plasma dripping from the walls at Jackie's house?  They got it on film.
How's this:  The phenomenon actually continues in not just one, not just two but in *three* houses.  All by the same ghost.
There are only two small drawbacks:  one is that they occasionally did use computer-generated stuff to show what the camera didn't pick up -- but those moments are not too frequent and can be forgiven.  The second drawback is the length -- unfortunately, they seem to repeat some scenes several times in a row, which can be rather tiresome.
All in all, however, this is a *must* for all ghost afficianados!",1057017600,2,1592,4.707581227436823
7895602,4,6305799032,"I actually saw this on TV a few days ago, and it scared the ... out of me!  I have never seen anything like this before! I was always unsure of the existence of ""paranormal"" activity, THIS CONVINCED ME!  Watch it... it will freak you out.",1051056000,,238,4.1521739130434785
7895603,4,6305799032,"This is a great documentary of a haunting. I am rather disappointed in the way they investigated the matter. They could have investigated the ghost, why it was haunting the person and how could they put him to rest.
They have great footage of orbs, and poltergeist-like happenings. I am definitely ordering this video.",1050969600,,318,4.907407407407407
