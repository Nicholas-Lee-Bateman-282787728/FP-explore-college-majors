7608289,1,B01ATCA3AU,"Extremely disappointed by this film.  As an ASD parent, I have heard lots of negativity around Autism Speaks but never really focused on that.  I think they're doing a great job on spreading global awareness through numerous year-long campaigns.  However, it seemed like they played a huge part in the creation of this film - their logo pops up several times, and some of the things said in the film were what others have claimed Autism Speaks is trying to accomplish.  Namely, that ASD individuals need to be cured.  The mother in the film actually gets upset because she is doing her best with her low-functioning child while another parent who doesn't seem to have done as much has now ""cured"" her child.  No one is cured from autism, and by including something like that in the film it supports this idea that there is something terribly wrong with these individuals that needs to be changed (or eradicated).
Also, this young girl - who has no background in how to care for differently abled children - suddenly becomes a miracle worker... ironically after watching the film ""The Miracle Worker"" and just by copying a couple of notes from other therapists on their services.  It completely trivializes the struggle that many parents and therapists face when they work with special needs children, by saying that some person can just come in with no idea about ASD and suddenly make a child talk.  And of course, the ASD child suddenly makes tons of progress in an extremely short period of time all thanks to this inexperienced 18 year old, who, at the start of the film, pinches and neglects the autistic child she was hired to help.",1462752000,11,1638,4.722807017543859

I was happy to see a movie that pointed out the toll on the family, and revealed more of the physical and emotional challenges associated with raising a child on the spectrum. Although the ending appeared to be a happy one, I was disappointed in the abrupt ending and would have love to seen more successes between Glory and Jack.",1477699200,,405,4.561643835616438

7608319,4,B01ATCA3AU,"As a parent with ASD and also two kids on the spectrum, one high one low,I can say I found this movie interesting. I can't believe any mother would act the way she did in the beginning ie: frantic, manic, and a little bit oh lets just call it crazy. The mothers and fathers of these awesome kids are strong, fearless and unwavering in their conviction to do whatever they must to do right by their kids. Also, if anyone thinks the proper way to teach a child is by dragging them back to a chair and forcibly holding them down to get your desired reaction, you are 100% wrong. You don't make them adapt to you, you adapt to their world. The scene with them on the swing and Gloria playing in the background is complete B.S. because right behind them is a water source which every ASD parent knows will attract the child like a moth to flame.  I understand they had to show progress within the movie with Gloria starting to talk and sitting at the table and using the spoon, however in real life these things take months or years of working on if they even get them at all. I did like that they tried to show what Gloria may see through her eyes and some of the struggles the parents have with interpersonal relationships and finances taking care of low functioning ASD kids. All in all I think this movie does give a glimpse into some of the struggles that goes on behind closed doors.",1464220800,7,1384,4.302681992337165
