4530727,5,B0052SO010,"An independent film Directed by Peter Hall and The Royal Shakespeare Company, Stratford-upon-Avon. This is one of those gems that allow many famous personalities of the time to display a little culture.

There are many fun facets of this film; right off, we notice all the actors in a much earlier version. Who would have thought that Judi Dench was once so cute? In addition, Helen Mirren before she was queen. Each version of midsummer Night's Dream displays a different star cast; this is the 1967 version many people will recognize Diana Rigg as Helena. Each version is to our advantage displays a different emphasis and dialog of William Shakespeare. Too many individual actors to point out.

Then there is the negative side. Look closely and it looks like an Italian film with English dubbing; the words and voices are not quite in sync. The cameraman is the one that filmed ""The Blare Witch.""

Believe it or not it is better the second time through.
This film is a must for the collector.

4530758,5,B0052SO010,It is one of my very favorite Shakespeare performances. Though it is old (1969) it is still the best and I am glad to have it in DVD.,1406073600,,133,3.7857142857142856
4530759,4,B0052SO010,"It is good to know that the HD version of this movie that is available on one DVD and from Amazon Streaming is not restored but is better quality than what I had before, and in the wider format. Not a fully restored version, but better than the VHS and TV screen format versions..",1401235200,,280,4.203703703703703
4530760,5,B0052SO010,"This is my favorite film version of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". It's filled with well-known stars from the British stage and screen.",1396656000,,133,5.090909090909091
4530761,5,B0052SO010,"This DVD-R copy of Peter Hall's Midsummer Night's Dream is a HUGE improvement over the WaterBearer Film's DVD release. This transfer is clean, with good color and (most importantly) excellent sound. It's a low budget production but -so what- the performances are great. My 11 year old daughter understood the humor and storyline and was laughing along with us. Now, this is the way Shakespeare should be performed!",1395878400,8,414,5.102941176470588
4530762,5,B0052SO010,"I received the DVD version for Christmas 2013.  I had been watching it on Amazon prime and decided that I wanted the actual hard copy.  The acting is superb, with many actors and actresses who would later become very well-known (excepting Dianna Rigg, who many people knew from ""The Avengers"")  The colors are quite good.  The quality of the grain varies.  On an HD TV, the parts filmed in bright daylight are extremely sharp.  The parts filmed in the more subdued light of the night woods have noticeably more grain.  I am guessing that this is due to a change in film with a higher ISO for a proper exposure, not an improper transfer.  The director's use of lights and the English manor setting grows on you.  It hardly matters, though, with the delightful acting of so many superb actors and actresses.  I also own the 1935 production.  What a contrast!  I enjoy them each in their own way.  The spirits of the Godfrey version are much more primordial/elemental than those of Reinhardt (1935).  The most ""complete"" version is Godfrey's.  Reinhardt sacrificed a lot of the dialogue (probably about 1/3) to give prominence to Mendelssohn's music, which gets extended play via ballet sequences.  Both versions are fascinating interpretations, and both are magical.",1387929600,,1264,4.8915094339622645
4530763,5,B0052SO010,"This version of A Midsummer Night's Dream has much to offer. It is directed by Peter Hall, the creator of the Royal Shakespeare Company and director of many great theater and film works. It also comes with a fantastic cast.

The considerable drawback of the film is the existing DVD sound quality. The voices of the actors appear to be post-production voice-overs, somewhat like the chessy Italian gladiator movies from the 1960's. The dialogue sounds like it was recorded in an air tunnel, leaving a tin-like, annoying ""hiss"" with every ""s"" uttered by the actors. The video quality is not bad, but the entire production, video and audio, is in serious need of a re-mastering.

The rewards of getting past these technological deficiencies are considerable. The cast contains the pantheon of English stage and screen from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. The cast includes Diana Rigg (Avengers); Ian Richardson (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy; Brazil); Michael Jayston (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy; Nicholas and Alexandra); David Warner (Morgan!, Titanic); Ian Holm (Brazil; Chariots of Fire);and, of course, current superstars Judy Dench and Helen Mirren --- All in one production! The performances are masterful, and even the existing condition the audio and video creates a great, almost magical, effect to the night scenes with the night spirits.

This review is based on the DVD version. It is my understanding that viewers purchasing the movies directly from the Amazon website is in HD quality, and hopefully with better sound quality.",1381190400,,1533,5.223577235772358
4530764,5,B0052SO010,"I love Shakespeare and this is by far my favorite....having this version, I have several others, with Dame Judy Dench and Ian Holm is amazing. I love both actors works and try to find everything they have done to watch at least once!! Now I can own this in the original Shakespearian english...LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! The package arrived exactly when the seller said it would and was in perfect condition!!! I will order from this seller in the future!!!",1377561600,,448,4.6835443037974684
4530765,5,B0052SO010,"The Twentieth Century Fox and MGM's 2011 release of Peter Hall's 1968 film adaptation of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a perfectly good print of this splendidly performed and clearly enunciated play. This is the print to obtain not the other poor copies issued earlier and much complained about on Amazon film reviews.

A host of Britain's finest actors from the last quarter of the twentieth century are shown here performing in the (near) nakedness of their (relative) youth from Judi Dench, Helen Mirren and Diana Rigg to Ian Richardson, Ian Holm and many more! They speak and act the text clearly, and the camera angles apart from a bit of camera tricky favour the faces and the viewer's right to hear the text properly.

The only significant flaw worth mentioning is the lamentable lack of subtitles, essential in all Shakespeare films.

Get it while you can!",1365897600,12,865,4.870748299319728
4530766,5,B0052SO010,A fun movie with excellent acting.  I would recommend this movie to any Shakespeare lover.  I'll be showing it o my kids during our Shakespeare unit.,1357344000,,149,4.6923076923076925
4530767,5,B0052SO010,"Seeing Judy Dench, Helen Mirren and Ian Holm (he of the Lord of the Rings) looking like 20 somethings in 1968, was a hoot. This is the Royal Shakespeare Company's production, so expect it to be faithful to the text.

We purchased it for the parents for Christmas. They're elderly academics, and big Judy Dench fans, who loved it.

Highly recommended.",1356566400,,350,4.721311475409836
8454229,5,B0052SO010,Took a while to arrive but the quility of the image is much better than a version I purchased ten years ago. Worth the wait.,1510704000,,124,4.0
8454230,5,B0052SO010,"You can't beat this amazing cast. Best DREAM ever.  Production values and filming style are a tad dated but it's still fun in a ""yay 60s"" kind of way. Thanks Amazon for making this hard to find DVD available in the states.",1499904000,,222,4.285714285714286
8454231,5,B0052SO010,Definitely a unique production with some great performers. As much fun as the Mickey Rooney version.,1497312000,,100,5.3125
8454232,5,B0052SO010,"Peter Hall's amazing film version of Midsummer features a bevvy of matchless Shakespearean actors from the RSC all of whom went on to outstanding careers.  Highlights are the nearly nude green fairies with red tongues (Judi Dench and Ian Richardson, with Ian Holm as Puck), the lovely friends turned rivals Diana Rigg (Helena) and Helen Mirren (Hermia), and the quick cuts and other camera tricks that add some late 60's magic to the timeless story.",1480118400,3,449,4.986666666666666
8454233,5,B0052SO010,"Outstanding film! The actors are stunning... it filled me with a deep sense of loss, though, for that higher caliber of actor that trained in traditional Shakespeare. We don't have a lot of those left these days.",1468281600,,212,4.756756756756757
8454234,5,B0052SO010,One of Shakespeare's greatest comedies performed by a fantastic cast. See it regularly!,1455408000,,87,5.769230769230769
8454235,5,B0052SO010,"This is my favorite film version of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Some people have complained about the image and sound quality. Previous versions may have looked bad, but the MGM Limited Edition Collection version looks and sounds fine for a move from the 60's. The online Amazon Video version looks much worse than this DVD version.",1444003200,,331,4.928571428571429
8454236,5,B0052SO010,"Absolutely marvelous adaptation of Shakespeares A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Reading this play is more than a little confusing.  Watching these masters reveal the play expands your understanding.  Seeing Dame Judi Dench as Titania, costumed in little more than green body paint is revealing, to say the least.  And Dame Helen Mirren is incredible (though clothjed).  Dame Diana Rigg is equally wonderful.  And Ian Holme as Puck is fantastic.  Make sure you buy this edition of this Royal Shakespeare Company play because it is much better reproduced than the other one available, a Water Bearer reproduction.  As to the other productions of the play (even by the RSC) I think this more traditional production and to be preferred.  Enjoy it.",1437004800,5,739,5.142857142857143
8454237,5,B0052SO010,"The Royal Shakespeare Company + Dianna Rigg, Helen Mirren and Judy Dench make what I think is the best version of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  I don't know why this version is not more widely known.",1425168000,3,197,4.472222222222222
8454238,5,B0052SO010,"I first saw this version of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM as a special presentation on commercial television before going off to college (yes, commercial TV did things like that back before PBS and in the pre-cable days). I fell in love with it and this is before I knew who any of the people (outside of Diana Rigg who was Emma Peel in THE AVENGERS) were. It is my favorite adaptation of the play. The late 1960s-early 1970s were a Golden Age for Shakespeare on film as directors reached out to humanize Shakespeare and remove him from the lofty pedestal where earlier theatrical generations had placed him. Starting with Franco Zefferelli's ROMEO & JULIET (1968) through Roman Polanski's MACBETH (1971), there were a handful of fresh, youth oriented adaptations of the Bard that featured gifted, up and coming performers. This is one of the best.

First up there's the once-in-a-lifetime cast almost all of whom would go on to major careers in movies and TV. There's Ian Holm, Helen Mirren, Diana Rigg, Ian Richardson, David Warner, and dressed in little more than a fig leaf (ivy actually) the one and only Judi Dench. Second and probably more important is the way they deliver Shakespeare's dialogue. Not stuffy and erudite but as if it were everyday conversation. They are also highly sensitive to Shakespeare's meter reminding us that Shakespeare was a poet as well as a playwright. Rarely have the lines sounded this fresh and spontaneous. This is one of the few Shakespeare adaptations where you won't need subtitles which is good because this DVD-R doesn't have any.

Finally there is the DVD-R itself. For years this performance was released in a substandard DVD from Waterbearer Films who simply copied their already existing VHS tape with its muddy visuals and muffled sound. It wasn't great and it was good enough just to have a record of it but it was a far cry from the film that I saw on TV and then in college. This new MGM Limited Edition DVD-R restores the film to how it looked then. A sharp, clear, colorful picture with clean, crisp sound so that you won't miss a word of dialogue. You also won't miss the Carnaby Street fashions which were contemporary then and now make the movie something of a period piece. However there's nothing dated about Shakespeare's dialogue or the way this cast delivers it making this A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM for the ages.",1414022400,15,2372,4.768856447688565
