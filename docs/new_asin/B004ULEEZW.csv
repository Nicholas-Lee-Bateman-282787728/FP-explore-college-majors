4467436,5,B004ULEEZW,"When I started watching this I felt a sudden deja vu, but then it hit me: ""To Have And To Have Not"" and ""Key Largo"", both with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.  is based on the same story by Hemingway that was the basis for the Bogart and Bacall picture. In fact many of the same key lines in ""The Gun Runners"" were from ""To Have And To Have Not"" and the ending is nearly the same as. in ""Key Largo."" This story develops differently from either so it is not strictly a remake of either even though it comes close to both in parts of the film. The acting is very good and the supporting cast is very strong. I like Audie Murphy films and this was not a disappointment. It will be added to my permanent video library.",1406764800,4,717,4.121428571428571

4467438,1,B004ULEEZW,"I could not play it on any DVD player or bluray player, but it would play on the computer. It would skip a bit, but you got the gest of the story. I don't know what the problem was. There was no blemishes on the disc. I tried it on two different DVD players and it wouldn't play. I tried it on three different Bluray players and it would start, but would hang up in the first few minutes. When I finally tried it on my desktop It played through, but jumped ahead a few times.",1404864000,,475,3.9583333333333335

4467442,1,B004ULEEZW,"Didn't really cared for this one or anything that Castroite DrunkardCommie/SovietSpy Hemmingway wrote or had movies based off his dumb pointless jibber-jabber drunk books. The Gun Runners Movie is Slow-paced and boring and this time takes place before or around the so-called ""Revolution""(The Movie is from 1958 so based then.)As Usual couldn't get an Decent Cuban to portray an Cuban and as Usual an American is the Villain or an ""Foreginer"" That's coming to take from Cuba that's how I read off of it,Although The Rummy I noticed he was in an Route 66 Episode don't know who the others are. Saw it On Netflix,Wouldn't go out of my way for it.",1367193600,2,644,4.758928571428571
4467443,5,B004ULEEZW,"I gave this a 5 star because of Audie. I had never seen this movie and didn't know what to expect because I've only seen Audie in westerns and ejoy them all. I thought he did an excellent job in this movie, and it kept my attention all the way through. Audie ta me wasn't only a war hero but also as a actor, ta me he always gave it everything he had and then some.",1351123200,5,365,3.8157894736842106
4467444,4,B004ULEEZW,"This is actually not a bad movie at all.  I thought Audie Murphy was better in this than anything I have seen him in before, and I am a big Audie fan, and have seen almost all of his films.  Not a typical role for him.  This movie reminds me of Key Largo with Bogart in certain parts ( not trying to compare it, but you'll see what I mean if you watch it).  I definatly would recommend it. I really enjoyed it and is a must for Audie Murphy fans.  I think this and No Name on the Bullet were his two best films.",1336521600,5,511,3.8285714285714287
4467445,3,B004ULEEZW,The movie is fair as is a little slow paced. I thought could have been a little more exciting. Not the action film of Audie Murphy roles I'm use to. I would tell everyone it's worth seeing.,1311292800,7,189,4.135135135135135

8441707,4,B004ULEEZW,"Much better than I expected.  Nice take on the Hemingway story, it's no ""To Have and Have Not"" but a solid B-picture.  Nice performances by Audie Murphy, Eddie Albert, and the always dependable Everett Sloane.  Director Don Siegel always makes the most of his script, budget, and actors.  I give it 4 stars as far as B-movies go.",1479772800,,329,4.620689655172414

8441709,3,B004ULEEZW,"This is one of Audie Murphy's rare non-western, and one of Don Siegel's lesser but still interesting efforts.  Yes, it is based on the same
Hemingway story that ""To Have and Have Not"" is.  (And not on Maxwell Anderson's ""Key Largo"".)  There is enough change in the story line from 1944 to 1958 (Free French intrigue to gunrunning the Cuban revolution) to make it plausible.  The Bacall character in the Howard Hawk's version is named Slim, here it is 'Swede' played by Gita Hall, a Swedish actress who only did a couple of more movies (and who died just a few weeks ago).
There is also just one rather mundane song in the background, rather than the extraordinarily lame songs Hoagy Carmichael wrote for the Hawk's film.  While Murphy is not Bogart, Everett Sloane's portrayal of the wino mate is closer to reality than Walter Brennan's 'Stumpy' routine he would perfect in Rio Bravo.  If there was not that other film to compare it to, this would rate a better rating.",1473033600,,969,4.637426900584796
