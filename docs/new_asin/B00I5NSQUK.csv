6251582,1,B00I5NSQUK,"I'm not happy with it.

The DVD has something wrong with it.  you  cannot fast forward or skip forward or back.  The only thing it will do is skip back to the beginning. If you want to repeat a portion, you cannot do it.  If you want to skip forward, you cannot do it. It is very annoying.",1397088000,5,289,3.913793103448276

I tried to order this on Amazon, but it is out of stock.  The version I had seen on Dish Network was colorized and the coloring was really well done.

6251584,3,B00I5NSQUK,It's a fun old movie filmed mostly in Colorado in the early 50's. This movie has lots of Colorado narrow gauge railroad shots and even has a brief part with a very young Maryln Monroe. It's a good movie but very hard to find.,1224547200,8,225,4.136363636363637

8639427,5,B00I5NSQUK,A classic western and train lovers movie.  The locomotive used in the movie survives and is on display at the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden.  This movie should be in every train buffs library.,1470787200,,197,4.764705882352941
8639428,3,B00I5NSQUK,"This comedy is billed as a satire, but it is not very satiric and it is a weak comedy. Along with Dan Daley, Anne Baxter stars. Rory Calhoun is in the film as a bad guy, Walter Brennan to add humor, and I am relatively certain that I saw Marilyn Monroe as one of the dancers in the film. The plot, which appeared in other movies, is that a train needs to get to a certain town (Tomahawk) by a certain time in order for the railroad to get a contract. A condition is that it must have at least one passenger. Dan Dailey is high jacked to serve as the one passenger.
Several things go wrong. The marshal is shot and cannot protect the train. He deputizes his granddaughter to take his place. She (Anne Baxter) is very good with a gun and a knife. She has no idea about sex, kissing, and relationships with men in general. Grandfather send an Indian with his granddaughter to make sure that she does not become entangled with a man.
The head of the stagecoach wants to stop the train because a train will take away a lot of his business. He has his men do various things to stop the train, including destroying some forty miles of tracks and destroying a bridge that the train needs to go over.",1461715200,3,1191,4.228070175438597
