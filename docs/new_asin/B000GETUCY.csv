8131018,5,B000GETUCY,"Great Spanish-language, Mexican-made double feature.  La Horripilante Bestia Humana aka Night of the Bloody Apes, made in the late 1960's, is a color film about a doctor/scientist who, with the best of intentions, tries to cure his son of a fatal ailment and with his treatment unintentionally turns him into a murderous, raping ape-man.  A female wrestler and her detective boyfriend go about trying to solve the series of strange, BLOODY murders.  My beef is that there is a LOT of blood.  There is also stock footage of actual operations in all their GRAPHIC glory.  The second film is better.  Munecos Infernales aka Curse of the Doll People, made in the early 1960's,is a black-and-white film about a curse laid on a bunch of scientists/adventurers who steal an idol from some natives.  They are then killed and turned into possessed doll people who go about killing the guilty parties with poisoned needles.  The curse is orchestrated by an evil voodoo priest and his zombiefied henchman who looks like he has a wrinkled towel for a face.  The actor who plays the voodoo priest is the most compelling character.  The female doctor who tries to solve the whole mess is the strongest character, a welcome change from the usual damsels in distress from that era.  I ordered the BCI/Eclipse DVD release.  The quality of the DVD is very good, probably the best out there.  It also has English-language alternatives.  Highly recommended.",1393113600,4,1437,4.933333333333334
