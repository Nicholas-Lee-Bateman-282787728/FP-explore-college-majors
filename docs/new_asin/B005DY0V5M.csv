4663275,4,B005DY0V5M,"Mads Brugger, a Danish director/manager takes two Danes of Korean descent to modern day 1984 for a comedy show. It is a Trojan Horse for the purpose of filming a documentary about the totalitarian state and its Dear Leader. Brugger has no illusions about the regime and is uncompromisingly hostile towards it. Behind a smiling mask and low-key statements, he ridicules the dictatorship and its minions, fully aware that behind the government facade lies a panorama of starvation and concentration camps.

One of the two Danish-Koreans, Jason, has a severe handicap and the country has a policy of exterminating ""inferior defectives,"" i.e., handicapped people, just like the Third Reich used to do. Ms Pak, their ""escort"" instantly becomes genuinely attached to him and we get the distinct feeling that her son was done away with for being born handicapped. Jason becomes attached to her as well as to the students who welcome them; it is obvious that he has been starved for affection for a long time. Yet, at the same time, he acknowledges the reality of N. Korea he also has affection for its people. At one point, while watching a Nuremberg-style spectacle, he persistently refuses to give the extended fist salute in spite of Brugger's pleading to go along; when asked why he does not do so, Brugger lies and Jason becomes angry at him. Then, surprisingly, they are whisked into the spectacle and become part of it, with Brugger joining in with the salute in subtle mockery, with Jason infuriated with him and the whole setup. Here, he proves to be the strongest one of all.",1343952000,,1578,4.866171003717472
4663276,4,B005DY0V5M,"Shocking, incredibly risky but yet highly entertaining! ""The Red Chapel"" gives viewers an inside look of life in North Korea but how director Mads Brgger and his two Danish comedian stars manage to pull of this documentary stunt is amazing!  Definitely recommended!

Mads Brgger, known in in Denmark as a filmmaker and TV host who has created documentaries such as ""Dane for Bush"" and most recently for ""The Ambassador"" is known for creating ""The Red Chapel"" (Det Rde Kapel), winner of ""Best Foreign Documentary"" at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and ""Best Nordic Documentary"" at the Nordisk Panorama 2009.

As American films such as ""Borat"" is known for pulling the wool on people's eyes through its comedy, Mads Brgger goes even further, not just for comedic sake but also to expose the nature of a country through incredible risk.

In the case of ""The Red Chapel"", filming a documentary in North Korea and to highlight the injustices of the country and also mock the regime.

But because of how North Korea is strict towards foreigners and everything is under observation and there is no freedom but also the chance they can very much get killed for attempting to film a documentary in North Korea, Mads Brgger knew the only way he can pull this off was to come up with a plan that wouldn't raise suspicion to the isolated inhabitants (note: North Korea has government controlled television sets and people living in the country have no true access to entertainment to television or film from other countries and if they are are caught tampering with their TV sets or trying to watch other entertainment from other countries, one can be executed or forced to hard labor in camps).

So, Brgger comes up with a plan that he will be the manager of two Danish Korean comedians who will be known as ""The Red Chapel"".

One is Simon Jul Jrgensen and the other is the disabled Jacob Nossell (Jacob has cerebral palsy).  Also, both men who do not work together shared the similarity that they were both born in South Korea and adopted and raised in Denmark.  Neither speak Korean but needless to say, it would peak the North Korean's interest.  Also, Mads Brgger would name the duo ""The Red Chapel"", not because it sounded socialist but secretly, the name is from an actual World War II spy ring in Nazi Germany.

Brgger presented the DPRK as a ""homecoming"" visit for the two Danish comedians of Korean descent who would perform a comedy piece for North Korean audiences.  Because North Korea is known to terminate mentally disabled children and only people dedicated to the government can live in the city of Pyongang, Mads Brgger knew that this could be an opportunity for North Korea to to use their visit not to just bridge a relationship with Denmark but also to show that North Korea's attitude towards mentally disabled people is not as negative as the west makes it out to be.  And the North Koreans granted Brgger two-week access to document their experiences on film, but the government would be allowed to review all footage each night.  Also, the three would be monitored outside of their hotel rooms.

So, the rouse begins with the three arriving to North Korea (and a fourth and unseen to the camera, their cinematographer, Rene Johannsen) and immediately they are assigned a guide named Ms. Pak, who is also observed by two others to make sure that these three are not spies and are indeed coming to North Korea to put on a performance.

While Mads Brgger will go under the guise as the comedian's manager and their Danish to English translator for Ms. Pak, the film will focus the emotions of Jacob Nossell.  Because he speaks spastic Danish due to his cerebral palsy, filmmaker Mads Brgger is taking a risk that no one will understand him but also to see the film and their experience through the Jacob. Even if Jacob himself is condemning the North Koreans in front of their face, knowing they don't understand him.

Using the comedians as a way to gain access to North Korea and to film around the country, it will give Brgger the chance to condemn North Korea in his documentary.  But to carefully create the documentary knowing that North Korea will scan through all footage to make sure that their is nothing that would hurt the country.

But all is not easy especially for Jacob as he does not like how the North Koreans are faking their kindness to him because he disabled (Jacob knowing that North Korea terminates their mentally disabled children) but how the North Koreans try to use them for their own propaganda to refute the notion that North Korea is bad towards those who are disabled.

And the fact that there are no mentally disabled people anywhere to be seen, Jacob realizes that what he has heard about what North Korea has done to mentally disabled children is most likely true.

But while they try to keep their intentions hidden, they must perform in front of many North Koreans under their rules and their style that would benefit and please their supreme leader and the North Korean people.

But as the three pretend to be North Korean regime sympathizers, can the three continue to keep up their act and leave North Korea alive?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Red Chapel"" is presented in color (1:85:1).  Mads Brgger could only depend on his cinematographer and editor Rene Johannsen to capture the footage and the film was digitally shot.  Picture quality is very good for a documentary and for the most part, the audio is clear and understandable.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Red Chapel"" comes with Lorber Films trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

 Mads Brgger is one brave Danish filmmaker.  Sure, we have seen Sacha Baron Cohen pull some crazy stunts with ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" for the sake of comedy, but Mads Brgger is not going after individuals, nor playing it safe by focusing on people in Denmark or America, ""The Red Chapel"" has Brgger literally trying to expose and denounce North Korea while being there with his two Danish Korean stars.

The documentary is hilarious, shocking but also very uncomfortable as you know these individuals, if found out, they can literally be killed or forced into hard torturous labor for the rest of their lives.

But his documentary depended on disabled comedian, Jacob Nossell.  To use his disability and knowing that not many can understand his English but also the fact that he speaks spastic Danish, which Mads Brgger can understand.  And through Jacob, we learn how difficult the whole process was for him to be in North Korea.

Especially in one scenes because North Korea is not used to seeing mentally disabled people, because the government feels a bit uncomfortable of Jacob's presence, they request for him to pretend his disabled and jump out of his wheel chair at times to show that he is normal whenever he is in public or at performances.

But Jacob is sharp and knows that not only is North Korea using him for their propoganda purposes, he knows that Brgger is using him for his documentary and he begins to get angered as he would tell Brgger of how uncomfortable he is and when the North Koreans ask what he is saying, Brgger would say something much more kind.  Which is probably smart as Brgger knew the risk that if they found out the truth, especially knowing that Jacob saying negative about the regime can hurt them, he had to play this off as the middle man perfectly.

While the film does not capture anything illegal by the North Koreans, Brgger narrates the portions about the empty roadways, the devoid of people walking the city streets of Ponggang and talks about the injustices of the North Korean regime.  So, while they did get access to North Korea, unfortunately there was no polemicizing that can be done by Brgger because their hands were literally tied behind their back.

If anything, the film depends a lot on Jacob's emotions and fears by the deception he feels on both sides.

There are no normal citizens that the three have access to.  Everything around them are government appointed.  From their guide, Ms. Pak to the cheerleading team who are assigned to star with the comedians for their live performance.

For westerners who are not so familiar with North Korea, they will probably be surprised to see a scene in which both Brgger, Jacob and their guide Ms. Pak are told to take part in an annual demonstration against the United States for splitting North and South Korea (North Koreans have been raised in believing that the U.S. was responsible for splitting the two countries, when in fact it was North Korea who attacked South Korea).  In fact, to showcase the propaganda of using Brgger and Jacob, the two are put in the front of the parade and the footage was televised.

Needless to say, ""The Red Chapel"" is quite audacious and an enjoyable yet risky documentary.  While it's not a documentary that is able to give freedom to Brgger to meet with citizens of North America or even for them to travel alone, it is rather unsettling because we know that Jacob is starting to lose it.  And whether or not his anger and depression of being in South Korea would reveal the true intention of Brgger.  Especially knowing full well that if their acts were revealed, more than likely these guys would receive harsh labor camp sentences or possibly execution.

But while not the most polemic documentary out there, ""The Red Chapel"" is clever, entertaining, hilarious and a bit shocking as well.
