8059847,4,B0009ETCWE,Not much of a movie or acting but the ladies were very attractive  and pleasing to watch.  Pool sequences were poor and u could tell the girls couldn't shoot pool.  If u shoot pool and have 90 minutes to waste this is for u!,1368403200,,224,4.045454545454546

8059850,1,B0009ETCWE,"I bought this movie the other day at Blockbuster. It was selling for $3.99. I wasn't expecting much, but this movie was worse than I thought it would be. The acting, script, and everything else was of a college film class quality. There are virtually no pool shots shown in the movie. The only shots shown are extremely easy. The dialog is corny. The script is predictable and stupid. The only way this film would be worth watching is if you know someone in the cast. Otherwise, do not waste your time.",1191110400,8,502,4.467391304347826
