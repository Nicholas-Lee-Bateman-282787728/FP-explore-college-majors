7996663,5,B0000AC8PB,Apparently neither the Brits nor the French can tell the truth about this little-known piece of history; and the Aussies are too embarrassed to talk about it much. Perhaps only Admiral Zhe and De Gama could really appreciate it.,1453680000,,228,4.871794871794871
7996664,5,B0000AC8PB,"This series, detailing the extraordinary competing voyages of the Englishman, Matthew Flinders and the Frenchman, Nicolas Baudin around the Australian coastline during the period of the Napoleonic Wars is well researched, beautifully photographed and absolutely fascinating.  Also well brought out is the the intense suffering of these expeditions and the pathos of both captains' careers and fate, both dying young, and in Baudin's case, his achievement obscured by the malicious account of one of his expedition members. Even more extraordinary is that these two incredibly gifted captains locked in a race bigger than themselves actually met at sea in the middle of the ocean south of Australia.  Even the academic talking heads (which I often find a real distraction) did not detract from the quality of the production.

Definitely worth a look if you have any interest in tales of exploration, the discovery of Australia or the Napoleonic period.",1275523200,3,951,5.369127516778524
