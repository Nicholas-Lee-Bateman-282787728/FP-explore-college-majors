7861585,3,6304092113,"Out West - A rather dry western, especially in the first half which offers little to no slapstick although Shemp is pretty funny during the card playing scene. Things pick up a bit during the ""breaking Larry out of jail"" scene, but for the most part the boys are just too subdued in these wild west settings. 3 stars

Punchy Cowpunchers - A much better stooge western, this one is a very good spoof of the genre cliches and the background music prevalent throughout the short adds something to the proceedings. Check out Shemp during the hilarious milkshake scene (mighty smooth), Jock Mahoney makes for a pretty funny bumbling hero and Christine McIntyre is splendid doing the ""poor, weak women"" routine, all the while clobbering anybody who gets near her. 4 stars

Merry Mavericks - Pretty much the only bad film Ed Bernds directed during the Shemp years and boy is it bad. The opening section with the stooges looking at their wanted poster is pretty good but things quickly nosedive after that and the supporting cast is very second rate compared to the supporting players who usually starred in these types of roles (Christine McIntyre, Jock Mahoney, Kenneth McDonald). 2 stars

Overall, a mixed bag to be sure, but nowhere near as bad as the ""Listen, Judge"" vhs.",1357948800,,1268,4.780821917808219
7861586,3,6304092113,"This tape is okay, but I'm disappointed that all three shorts are westerns. I don't like real western movies, and even the Three Stooges can't spice them up, at least not very often.
OUT WEST (1947) is actually great. It's Shemp's second short, and one of my top ten Shemp films. Shemp has to go OUT WEST on a vacation so his enlarged vein can heal. Vernon Dent, as a doctor, is his usual funny self. The rest of the short is great, too. They fix the bad guy an ""Ickeymay"" Finn in one scene. A+
I can't say the same thing for MERRY MAVERICKS (1951). The title made me want to see it. That's how I learned not to judge a Stooge film by it's title. The last scene includes blood. That goes against Stooge polocies. Possibly the worst Shemp film ever made. D+
PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS (1950) well, I don't know. This short, in a way, sort of rips off OUT WEST. Most of the characters repeat their original parts. It's not as bad as MERRY MAVERICKS, but it's just too boring. C+
A pretty good tape. Too bad it had to be an all-western themed video.",1009756800,,1038,4.247474747474747
7861587,1,6304092113,"One of the worst Three Stooges tapes I've seen.  I just don't like westerns at all, not even the Stooge versions, and this is an all-Western tape.  To me, Westerns are dry and boring.  OUT WEST, PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS, MERRY MAVERICKS.  OUT WEST is way too Westerny for my likes.  MERRY MAVERICKS is an awful effort from the usually-great director Edward Bernds.  As for PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS, I actually like that short a lot since it actually rips on Westerns and it's a well-done hilarious short, but I hate the idea of it being on an allWestern themed collection.  If PUNCHY was put on a tape with other, non-Western themed Stooge shorts, then it would be more enjoyable.
Plus, there's a nasty error on the back of that tape that states MERRY MAVERICKS is Edward Bernds' personal favorite Stooge film, but it's actually PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS.  MERRY MAVERICKS was a low-quality effort from him and I bet he and the Stooges knew it, so he would not say that was his favorite short.
Meh!  Just may be the worst Stooge tape I've seen.",1005264000,,1025,4.65
7861588,5,6304092113,"The Three Stooges go ""Out West"" in these three episodes.
""Out West"" (1947): Because of Shemp's 'enlarged vein' in his leg, the doctor recommends that he goes out west. So the three hit the trail and the turn a certain town topsy turvy when the bad guy thinks that they mean a gold vein. One of the best scenes in this episode is where Moe and Shemp try to get Larry free.
""Punchy Cowpunchers"" (1950): When the U.S. Cavalry hires the three stooges to break up a gang of border thieves, the Killer Dillons, you can except this episode to be a comedy that can't be missed! I love Elmer who with his Southern drawl, always bumbling along. I also like the part where Nell insists that she's 'a poor weak woman', knocks the lights out of Dillon's henchman, then faints away.
""Merry Mavericks"" (1951): The Stooges are mistaken for famous marshals and venture to stop some crooks from making off with hidden loot. I like the beginning where Larry explains to Shemp what vagrancy means. ""You take a flower, then you smell it. That's 'vagrancy'"".",1001203200,2,1036,4.575268817204301
7861589,5,6304092113,"These three Western comedies (all with Shemp Howard) are among the Three Stooges' best shorts. OUT WEST and MERRY MAVERICKS are very enjoyable, and PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS is outstanding, with a sterling supporting cast and some  riotous acrobatics by Jock Mahoney (the dauntless but clumsy cowboy who  takes spectacular pratfalls). Guaranteed laughs for comedy fans.",956793600,4,362,5.685185185185185
