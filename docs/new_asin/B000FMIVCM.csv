8124692,4,B000FMIVCM,"Much of the content of this video was previously released on Steve Taylor Video Album - I Predict 1990, and Videoworks.

Previously unreleased material:

Chagall Guvera ""Murder in the Big House"" promo video - mainly about the band and how great and original they're going to be.

I Predictionary - I took this as a parody of self-promoting ""up close and personal"" or ""behind the scenes"" videos. Steve  gives us a tour of his small apartment, including the ""office"" (bathroom) where his secretary (his wife, Debbie) is typing. His medicine cabinet is filled with his tapes and CDs, which he encourages us to buy. We also get to watch Steve brush his teeth, read us a Bible verse, and order tacos at a drive-through.

Greenbelt '88 on Super 8 - a tongue-in-cheek look at music festivals, particularly Christian music festivals. Much too long and banal. Fast forward through this one. Really.

The Lost Interview - a clip from the early '80s, when Steve Taylor and Amy Grant had just won Dove awards. The ""interviewer"" is busy trying to explain who Amy Grant is and who Steve Taylor is, what the Dove Awards are, and how this is going to be The Next Big Thing. The few questions he asks Steve and Amy don't give them much chance to talk, and they both look uncomfortable to be there.

Baby Talk and Joe's Distributing - Two short student films Steve wrote and directed. I'd read about these on various fan sites, but hadn't had the opportunity to see them. Each starts with an interesting premise, and shows briefly how that idea might have played out. (Baby Talk is based on an actual event that would have caught my attention.) They're not bad, mainly because they're not long, but nothing I'd want to watch a second time.",1444176000,,1721,4.641447368421052
