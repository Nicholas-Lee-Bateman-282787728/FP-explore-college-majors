7855804,4,6303824374,"A fun variation on the now tiresome action formula (terrorists take over a building; one hero, or heroine has to save the day) popularized by Die Hard.  Cynthia Rothrock performs well on the acting & fighting front, and you can't go wrong with a bit of Stacy Keach can you?  Shame on whoever thought 'yes'; the man's an acting powerhouse.  Keach is obviously not to stretched at all by his role here, but he and Rothrock make for a fun pairing.  This was a made for TV movie, which some have speculated was intended to spawn a TV series.  I can't vouch for the veracity of these claims, but if true it's a darn shame it never materialized.  This is worth 7/10, upgraded to 4 stars for Amazon's rating system.  Shame there are no DVD or Blu Ray releases of this.  Rothrock's output has been rather shamefully neglected on post-VHS formats.",1447372800,,838,4.503311258278146
7855805,3,6303824374,"Cute and Fun and that's about it.  Rothrock looks fine in a tight sweater and tan slacks actuating her in some of her best shape ever.  Stacy Keach brings a very PG-MikeHammer-ish performance, though I've always liked the guy, so it was fine with me.

Would have liked more CR fight scenes, but that's just me.",1409011200,,310,4.5
7855806,5,6303824374,I have always been a fan of cynthia rothrock and i do wish you would release this on dvd because i think this was one of her best films.,1336867200,,136,3.7241379310344827
7855807,4,6303824374,"It seems that for every so-so action film that Cynthia Rothrock makes, a genuinely good one like this slips through the cracks (UPDATE: Thank you, Amazon, for finally releasing a DVD). This comes with the territory of being an obscure action hero, but it's disappointing that this long-forgotten TV movie made 17 years ago is more enjoyable than most of the films she's made since. This is undoubtedly one of Cynthia's best American movies. I cannot speak so surely about fellow star Stacy Keach, but of the relatively few straight action flicks that he's starred in, I can't imagine that this one is among the worst. Director Kevin Hooks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passenger-57/dp/6304936311/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passenger 57</a>) is commendable for taking a small-time production filmed in Australia and making it into something particularly memorable for fans.

The story: Sergeant Harris Stone (Keach,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mike-Hammer/dp/B000SNUR34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mike Hammer</a>) is an aging daredevil cop with just a few months left before his retirement when he's teamed up with Charlie Heller (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>) - a rookie martial arts machine intended to keep him out of dangerous situations. These prove unavoidable when the pair find themselves in the middle of a hostage situation in a shopping mall. With Harris on the outside and Charlie stuck on the inside, the two must become the team they never expected to be in order to take down the criminal mastermind (Christopher Neame,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellbound/dp/B000AYEL2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellbound</a>).

Readers must pardon me for focusing at length about Cynthia, but I get the impression that this is a much more significant movie for her than it is for Mr. Keach. Outside of Hong Kong, Rothrock's relationship with 'A-movies' has been an estranged one: no matter how decent a film of hers may have been, you could always tell at a glance that it was a low-budget martial arts film, but in the case of ""Irresistible Force,"" an exception is made. No, it's not about to be mistaken for a multi-million dollar blockbuster, but this is the only one she's done - with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Getaway/dp/6302150957/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Getaway</a>&nbsp;- where the commercial intent shines through and the movie could be deemed respectable by casual viewers. In other words, it's an actual 'movie,' not a special-interest 'martial arts movie'. Worry not, though, action fans: Cynthia still gets four remarkably well-shot brawls with plenty of kicks and a few frying pans to the head amidst the smattering of gunfights.

""Irresistible Force"" runs at a slim 80 minutes, and that's probably for the best. It's an action movie, after all, and the story didn't need any stretching out. This compactness allows you to enjoy the film for its strengths and pardon the faults that you aren't expected to endure for too long...with the possible exception of Rothrock's acting. While Keach is consistent in his tough guy portrayal and Christopher Neame makes a great hammy villain, Cynthia's lack of dramatic talent shows, even though it takes a while and she's obviously trying hard to remain true to her role. She has a young Michael Bacall (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Proof/dp/B000R7HY0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Proof</a>) to keep her company on the bad actors' bench, but luckily the complaints stop there. The cast also boasts the ever-underrated Paul Winfield (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sounder/dp/B001E1HCRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sounder</a>) as the police commander and Nicholas Hammond (the first person to ever play&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/630180287X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>) as the special forces chief, and most everybody does a more-than-passable job.

There are a couple tidbits introduced in the film - including that Charlie was turned down from by the Special Forces for being too violent and that she's acrophobic - but aren't really pursued. I would have liked a scene where Charlie's overeagerness or fear of heights really gets her and Harris in trouble, but those are nitpicks when considering that we get a scene where the two of them deck bad guys while riding a motorcycle through the mall. You don't even have to be a fan of any member of the cast to enjoy it - simply being a fan of early-90s action films is reason enough to buy this one.",1263427200,3,4915,6.191800878477306
7855808,4,6303824374,"This is a fairly obscure movie, I had never even heard of it until a short while ago, and I thought I had seen all of Cynthia Rothrock's movies. This was a failed pilot made by CBS, I don't know if it ever aired on the network, certainitly no series ever came to be.

The great Stacy Keach stars as an aging cop, who wants to take things easier on the job, he's always getting shot due to his gung ho anticks. He decides what he needs is a female partner, enter Cynthia Rothrock, who's not quite a cop because she failed the academy for being too agressive. But if Keach can work with her, they'll give her a pass. On their first day, they foil a robbery, get suspended and find themselves battling terroists in a shopping mall, Die Hard style.

A very busy 77 minute run, lots of great action, including some great stuff by Cynthia, when she dose her famous scorpion kick my heart melts. Keach is perfect in the Danny Gloverish role, he's wise and wisecracking. If this never aired on TV it was probably due to the level of violence, this thing is non-stop action like a theatrical movie of it's day. It happens to be one of Rothrock's finest moments, working with one of her biggest budgets and most seasoned actors, with the right oppurtunitie she could have been a star on par with Seagal or Van Damme, only prettier.",1247961600,7,1321,4.365853658536586
