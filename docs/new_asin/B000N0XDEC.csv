2752497,5,B000N0XDEC,"INCREDIBLE DVD! Five different stories, each in different languages (Arabic, Turkish, Indonesian, Nigerian, and Farsi) of the conversion of Muslims after a supernatural dream or vision of Jesus.

The fact that the producers choose to keep each story in it's native language and use sub-titles only added to the impact of each story. Simple and very well done production values. Amazing, amazing video.",1178668800,11,401,5.365079365079365

2752503,5,B000N0XDEC,"THIS IS AWESOME! I was told and I observed that most muslims have a sincere desire to know God and to draw near to him, well that's exciting. Muslims also have a very sincere reverence for the Qu'uran, (something we can learn as Christians), well God respects that and God is using that to respond them, these stories of Jesus appearing in the bedrooms of muslims in the middle east will move you to tears, the coolest part is  once they start following Christ, they become radical Christians. Martyrs. Purchase this DVD it will have a profound impact on your life :-) GUARNTEE!",1426464000,3,578,4.611650485436893

This confirms my knowledge of God's love for all of His human creation and how He will not let anyone perish that sincerely seeks Him.  I've read some of these stories in books and know there is even more to these incredible stories and wish they were longer, but even these short ones are very inspirational.

2752519,5,B000N0XDEC,"I don't know if we should call it a movie or docudrama, but whatever it is, I loved watching it.  The stories were very interesting in and of themselves.  I cried watching them.  I appreciated the lengths the film makers  went to to show what these people's lives and cultures really looked like.  You could sense the authenticity they applied to each scene.  It made the characters more relatable, because even though visuals can make cultures seem worlds apart, some things are the same in every human experience- families getting together, fathers playing with children, the uncomfortable seating of a hospital waiting room, not being able to sleep, calling out to God when we don't know where to go.  Christians will love powerful evidence of Jesus calling his children to faith in Him through dreams and visions.  It strengthened my faith in God and depend my love for Him because I know  that he is working miracles to bring his children home.  Muslims and non Christians will find this a tough nut to swallow.",1341878400,,1016,4.787356321839081
2752520,5,B000N0XDEC,"I lived in several of these nations and know that witnessing for Christ to Muslims is something Westerners do not understand how to do.  So this is a powerful tool to tell westerners more about what Muslims are really like and their difficult search for the living God.  Westerners have a very distorted image of what the average Muslim is like, many are seeking God with all their heart.  I was so excited about this movie that I sent a copy to a tiny church in Muslim nation I used to serve in, where I used to worship.  I thought it would help them witness to Muslims in their area.  It was amazing, the story in the movie from the person speaking their language turned out to be a person they already knew in an adjacent country, who is still serving Christ.  It was a great confirmation to me that these are not made-up, feel-good stories, but accurate.  Great movie and shows the age of miracles never ended and Christ is working in areas where Christians don't seem to be reaching on their own.  A great film to give Christians a heart of love for witnessing to Muslim, not trying to beat them over the head with a Bible (which doesn't work).",1341100800,2,1149,4.386792452830188
2752521,4,B000N0XDEC,"The following is an unbiased review of the movie ""More Than Dreams"":

More Than Dreams is a reenactment-interview style movie following the personal stories of five muslims (4 men, 1 woman) across five different countries. Each mini movie (usually around 50 minutes) is told and reenacted in the main person's language and country with English subtitles. The Muslims not only come from different countries, but unique backgrounds, relationships with family and level of commitment to Islam.

Part 1: Review of Production
Pros-
-Camera shots were solid for an independent film. Several shots in particular were above average and interesting to watch.
-For the most part, there was no problem with reading the subtitles.
-Each reenactment was clear and concise.

Cons-
-Several of the actors/actresses for the reenactments were below par at times.
-On one or two of the mini movies, the interviewee was not seen (although heard) until halfway through or at the end of the movie.

Part 2: Faith Factor
Pros-
-The Muslims come from various countries, family backgrounds and with different outlooks on life, showing that Muslims are not ""one size fits all"".
-Each person recounted their personal story, not hiding the level of commitment to Islam (which ranged from barely involved to radical extreme) or their mistakes and flaws.

Cons-
-The very content of More Than Dreams produces debate and biases before the movie is even watched.
-Because of this, many people will either not watch the movie, not watch it with an unbiased opinion or not watch it all the way through.

In the end, More Than Dreams is five people explaining their story of how they came to faith in ""Prophet Isa"". Simply that. Reviews of this movie will mainly be formed from individual opinions of Christianity, Islam or faith in general- not because of the movie itself. When watching this movie, remember that these people are only sharing what they've experienced. It is the same with any movie, music or book- only the theme of the experience is different.

Conclusion: More Than Dreams was well done for an independent reenactment-interview film. It is controversial in the fact that each person's story heavily deals with matters of faith.",1340150400,3,2214,5.082644628099174
2752522,5,B000N0XDEC,"This really is an excellent depiction of the new world-wide trend we are seeing of Muslims coming to Christ. Praise God, He answers prayer! If you want more of this then check out The Seekers (DVD) and Which None Can Shut (book by Reema Goode). Great stuff!",1337558400,,257,4.48936170212766
2752523,5,B000N0XDEC,"This movie simply grabs the heart and lets the mind soar.  No matter how crushing human existance becomes, life finds a way to lift us above it.  This movie challenges the over rationalization of our generation and awakens the heart to possibilities greater than the world of politics and hatred.",1332460800,,296,4.9
2752524,5,B000N0XDEC,"""More Than Dreams"" was a film that Christians,Muslims, and non believers should view. It is not safe for Christians to be Christian in some countries because they bring dishonor onto themselves and can be killed. God over rides all that by appearing to Muslims in dreams and visions. The people in this film were touched by God and accepted Him even at their own peril. The script is believable and the film is well done. This film will be in our church library for families to view.",1308960000,,483,4.563218390804598
2752525,5,B000N0XDEC,"I have seen and heard good, bad, and lots of fear mongering about Muslims since 911, this video treats the subject from a spiritual perspective rather than a secular, non spiritual viewpoint. Religion is often quite different than true spirituality. True spirituality will lead a person TO God. God is not HATE; God is LOVE.
This dvd is really 5 separate stories about 5 different people in 5 different countries speaking 5 different languages all having the SAME spiritual DESIRE. They all wanted to know God more intimately. Their lives were obviously very different but as the case with all of humanity, we share some very basic emotional and spiritual needs. My dvd was not translated into English but was in the 5 original languages with a choice to have English sub titles. My wife does not like sub titles, they distract her. For me the stories were so compelling that afterwards I could not remember that they were not in English. I understood so well that I thought that I had actually ""heard"" them in English.  The dvd is supposed to be coming out in English and may even now be so available, but be aware it may be sub titles and original language. Personally I think that the original languages depict the stories MORE true-to-life, although they are still reenactments (but true stories in their respective countries).

Excellent video!",1302912000,,1349,4.8354978354978355
2752526,1,B000N0XDEC,"I would say watching this DVD was waste of time, same resources and potential you spent on backbiting ISLAM could have been spent on telling right side Christianty and great teachings of jesus.

If you watch this DVD with a fair and honest brain, you will find how disgusting is this thought behind this DVD. I do not think this is putting Islam down in anyway or helping Christianity.

Anyone with slight common sense can smell twisted facts mentioned in this DVD.

I would say SIMPLY waste of my time, waste of resources to make this DVD and all characters seem really fake.",1292976000,2,576,4.572815533980583
2752527,1,B000N0XDEC,"Not based on facts - Facts and figures are twisted to propagate negative images of a religion, In fact Islam is widely spreading religion in the world and this DVD is one of those efforts which shows how much vanishing religions are afraid of it.",1292976000,2,246,4.488888888888889

2752530,5,B000N0XDEC,"This is a wonderful docu-drama that is very well acted and very compelling.  There are five different stories, each in a different language with English subtitles.  Each story has it's own heart felt message of love and forgiveness. It is a very good film to promote the understanding of how God sent his Son, Jesus and still sends Him to the lost.  A wonderful message for adults and children.  I highly recommend this beautiful film.",1282003200,,435,4.76
2752531,5,B000N0XDEC,"I heard of this miracle happening from a friend with relatives who are missionaries.
This movie or docudrama is extremely well done and shows God moving in our world today.",1277683200,,172,4.766666666666667
2752532,5,B000N0XDEC,This movie is not just another run of the mill poorly done movie on why you should accept Christ and his free gift of salvation. These are real testimonies of Muslims who have had a personal meeting with Christ just as the apostle Paul had. It is presented in their language with subtitles. It also shows that Christ does not need a high budget missions organization to do his work. Christians will be blessed and convicted in their faith watching this movie. I have some missionary friends who have been on the mission field in Sudan and they have told me the things depicted in this film are a common occurrence in the muslim world. Thought provoking for muslims and christians alike.,1271894400,6,686,4.631147540983607

2752534,5,B000N0XDEC,"I can't fully express in words how wonderful this docudrama is.  It was awesome, spectacular, powerful and real.  You could actually feel the pain and joy of each of the characters as their story was played out.  It seemed as if God had his hand in the making of this master piece.  There are 5 short personal stories all reenacted, but they all seemed so real.  You will have to see it for yourself; I promise, you won't be disapointed.",1261958400,4,437,4.4125
2752535,5,B000N0XDEC,"I found this collection of testimonies portrayed so encouraging, powerful and heartfelt. No matter who you are or what your cultural/ethnic background is, you will be able to relate and be blessed by one or more of the lives that have been miraculously transformed by God Himself. Gods Great Love and Mercy is undeniable. ""It's not by might, nor by power, But by My Spirit says the Lord!""  In watching this, I see more how unlimited God is. My faith & hope was strengthened. God looks & loves us beyond the variations of skin color, clothing, language (& accents), culture, status & faults and sees the true need of man which is revealed in this collection. May He help us all to see this too.",1261267200,4,693,4.544
2752536,5,B000N0XDEC,"I loved to hear the testamonies of these five people. God has made a way even in face of countries expelling or martyring ministers of the Word of God. This collection of true stories was so inspiring I watched it over and over again. I have been told by my fellow student pastors from other countries that this is happening all over the muslim world, and there is nothing that can stop it! Romans 8.38-39 tells us this. What has happened to these people is happening everywhere. The 'good news' will be preached to all areas of the globe as foretold inspite of men trying to stop it. If a person asks their heavenly Father for a piece of bread He will not give them a stone.",1254873600,2,675,4.322834645669292
2752537,5,B000N0XDEC,"The same phenomenon also happened to me, a former Buddhist from Thailand, just more than a year ago with the same result.  Yes, it changed my life forever and I am now a follower of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ.  Since I was very young, as soon as I could remember, everybody in my family kept telling me, ""There is no God, but Buddha."" and ""All Christians are mentally ill.""  I knew virtually nothing about God, Jesus, Bible, or the cross.  ""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life"" surely appeared to me at my house 17 months ago and made a believer out of me.  The only reason why I was born again is because God exists and Jesus Christ is He.  Now, I can faithfully confess that Jesus of Nazareth is my Lord and my Savior.  If it could happen to a (former) Buddhist who was as ignorant as I once was, it can happen to anyone.  So, please, give Jesus a chance to come into your life, to make you the person He truly created you to be.  The best thing is it's free of charge, a gift from God through His only begotten Son.  It's all about GRACE and it feels great to be saved and truely alive. Praise the Lord!",1253750400,19,1111,4.101851851851852

All the stories are absolutely wonderful (Fire Stars); the one that put me over the edge and by its self is worth the price of the DVD is Dini. I was crying with happiness that made my heart leap for joy for her.  The story made me think how she must have been feeling at that moment she tells her traveling partner she just forgave someone who has cause her the deepest pain from the past.

If you want to renew your own faith in Lord Jesus Christ or are curious about the Bible and Jesus, this series gets right to the heart of Christianity in laymen's terms.

I strongly recommend this series.",1227657600,5,828,4.32258064516129
2752541,5,B000N0XDEC,"I'm not usually fond of movies with sub-titles.  This one however is an exception.  These are true stories of the conversion to Christianity of Moslems from five different countries: Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria, Egypt, Iran.  Each person experienced a very unique visitation in a dream.  Spoken in their native languages the true story of how they were each brought to the Christian faith is retold. All sought God who they knew only as Allah. You meet the actual individuals at the end of each depiction.  Inspirational for any Christian and especially those who are drawn to evangelism.  A wonderful tool for witness to Moslems with an open mind seeking truth.  Truly amazing stories of how these Moslems, broken and fully surrendered discovered Christ without any foreknowledge of Christ or the gospel.",1227398400,3,804,5.138461538461539
2752542,5,B000N0XDEC,"This dvd belongs in every Christians collection, and is truly one of, IF NOT the best film I've ever seen. This film moved me to tears, esp. in the story about the man who is abusive to his wife, and how he became a new man after seeing Christ in a dream.
I invited a friend over to see it, and he was moved to tears after seeing the first story! It was that powerful!
It conveys the important message that the Muslims need to be reached more than ever.
I would recommend this film to ANYONE. Truly a remarkable film! You absolutely need to get this dvd at once! You won't be sorry!!",1219363200,4,583,4.12280701754386

2752544,5,B000N0XDEC,"Without a doubt, the stories in this DVD are among the most amazing and wonderful of any DVD listed with Amazon.com; especially so since they are documented to be true.  I appreciated that three of the appearances of Jesus came in dreams, and two in conscious visions.  Only one of these people had any access to a Christian church.  In one case, the man was faithful to whom he knew was Lord for two years before happening on a Christian radio broadcast; he was then able to obtain his first New Testament.  In another story, the Muslim relatives repeatedly tried to kill the new convert - but he was protected from even a poison drink and poisoned arrows.  The only young woman was compelled to leave her family at the age of 16 or 17; but she remained faithful to her Savior.  So these are not just stories of 'seeds' that sprang up but then withered under the stresses of harsh conditions.  All of them had to pay a high price for their belief.  Christ was not only the Savior of their souls, but the Provider for their needs in a radically new life.

This is a DVD that will not fail to inspire Christians, and one that would prove very challenging to Muslims and members of other faiths.
[For Farsi-speaking Persians, the man in the fourth story is currently listed as pastor of a Persian/Iranian church in Fremont, CA.]",1206403200,38,1326,4.491666666666666
2752545,5,B000N0XDEC,"This is without a doubt the best film I've ever seen!! I laughed and cried through each of the stories that were told. What a blessing to see how God worked in these former Muslims hearts and led them to the way of salvation through Jesus Christ alone. This is one film that every Christian should see. It shows how God is concerned about each one of us personally and will work in our lives if we will allow Him to.

I thought the acting was great and the film seems to be shot on site in each of the countries portrayed. I can't say enough good stuff about this film. Don't miss it! You definitely won't be sorry.",1197331200,33,615,4.168067226890757

The quality is outstanding, but it's the content that is breathtaking.  5 stories - chosen from hundreds upon hundreds of other stories - of Muslims receiving dreams and/or visions of Jesus coming to them to offer a real relationship with God.  Each story is a dramatic reenactment interspersed with interviews of the actual person, done in the original languages with English sub-titles.  The most impressive features of these films: 1) The way that these dreams and visions are depicted on film is simply magnificent - realistic and awe-inspiring; 2) The ethnic/geographic diversity of the 5 stories (Indonesia, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, and Nigeria); 3) These films effectively portray Muslims as real people and not all fanatics - something many Western Christians need to realize; 4) The 5 minute sermonettes at the end of each film by a pastoral figure from that nation.

[13] Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

Galatians 3:26-27
[26] For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.
[27] For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.

Let's continue to pray for our Muslim brother's to accept Jesus not as a Prophet but as the Son of God.
