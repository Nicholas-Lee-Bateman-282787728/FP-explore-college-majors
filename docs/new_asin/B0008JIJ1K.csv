2259633,4,B0008JIJ1K,"Comedic legend Redd Foxx was the star of his own sitcom, ""Sanford and Son,"" in the early 1970s. Demond Wilson played his single son, Lamont, who lived with him in his junkyard home and store in South Central Los Angeles, California. The series was produced by the legendary television producer Norman Lear. Based on the British sitcom called ""Steptoe and Son,"" Fred and Lamont have an incredible final season where both characters are engaged to Janet and Barracude Donna (Lynn Hamilton who was the real life sister of fellow actress LaWanda Page who played Aunt Esther) in this season.

There are all 24 episodes on three discs with familiar faces like Fritzi Burr (the angry white lady on the Hawaiian flight reappears at the Redd Foxx lookalike contest); Helen Martin (Good Times, 227), Eric Laneuville (St. Elsewhere) played Esther and Woody's adopted son; Hal Williams (227); Don Ho; Barbara Rhoades; Greg Morris (Mission Impossible); Whitman Mayo; Janet Dubois (Good Times) ; Roscoe Lee Browne; and others as well. You have to love LaWanda Page as his sister-in-law Esther. I just love watching Esther and Fred handcuffed together in one episode.

I loved how Fred and Lamont went to Hawaii and on location. It began the season off and it was a terrific season indeed for a final one. I enjoyed watching Aunt Esther and Woody adopt a teenage son, Daniel (Eric Laneuville). The cast is first rate and the writing is crisp too. I can still laugh forty plus years later.

I wished there was more special features to the DVD about Redd Foxx and the cast as well. I remember LaWanda Page being interviewed on Sally Jessy Raphael about how Redd wanted her for the series as Aunt Esther. Foxx had recently died at the time too. You can tell they really enjoyed working together despite the onscreen insults. Redd Foxx influenced others as well through his comedy records before sitcom television. Too bad, Redd died bankrupt. Eddie Murphy paid for his funeral but Redd deserves so much more. How about a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and an induction into the Television Hall of Fame? If Redd had lived, he would have been awarded the Mark Twain Prize and a possible Kennedy Center Honors as well.",1453680000,,2201,4.786842105263158

2259654,3,B0008JIJ1K,"Well, if you want to complete your collection, the 6th season of ""Sanford & Son"" is a must have from that standpoint--from a laughs standpoint, Season 6 is definitely the weakest year of the show.

It's hard for me to pick one episode that stands out; maybe the 2 part saga about Aunt Esther and Uncle Woody adopting a kid. And the episode where Fred gathers all his loved ones for the reading of his will--that was pretty funny. Apart from that, the writing and the situations have definitely hit bottom.

How the show could have fallen off so far from the hilarious first 4 seasons is beyond me, but you could see the cracks in the show starting with season 5. And the Redd Foxx lookalike contest episode might be the worst yet--another example of the show's creative talents trying to be a little too clever and cute perhaps, harking back to the awful ""Steinberg and Son"" show from Season 5.

I hate to be so negative about ""Sanford and Son"", especially considering that during the show's first 4 years, S & S was one of the funniest sitcoms ever created. At its heights, ""Sanford and Son"" was a riot, but season 6 is anything but.

But as I said before, if you're a fan then you will probably want to complete your collection.

Lamont fears Fred is going deaf in ""A Matter of Silence"", & it is discovered that Fred has an oil well on his property in the episode ""California Crude"". An old friend of Fred's drops by in ""Carol"", which involves a flashback to 1936. In an election year of 1976, politics is the order of the day in ""Committee Man"", as Fred is appointed to serve on the city council. Needing money to pay the lease on The Sanford Arms, Fred goes on a gambling spree in Las Vegas, & Fred accidentally shackles his & Esther's wrists in ""The Defiant Ones"". Fred becomes a church deacon to avoid paying taxes in ""The Reverend Sanford, & Fred faces age discrimination when he's not allowed to purchase a stereo on credit in ""Fred The Activist"". Fred traces his Jewish roots in the episode ""Funny, You Don't Look It"", & ""School Daze"" (the final episode) finds Fred in another misunderstanding while studying for his high school diploma. After six seasons & 135 episodes, ""Sanford and Son"" comes to a close. ""Sanford & Son - The Sixth Season"" contains many comical moments - so many in fact, that you'll want to add this title to your all-important DVD collection. Get it ASAP!

2259720,5,B0008JIJ1K,"The quotes from this 5-star series are endless. The title of this review is a lonely sample of the hilarious zingers that Fred (Redd Foxx) would make in reference to Aunt (""watch it sucker!"") Esther.

Laughs abound in these wonderfully crafted episodes that covered all issues from family values to cultural difference and made great fun of every subject.

Sanford and Son was way ahead of its time for a 1972 debut. Creator Norman Lear (The Jeffersons, Good Times and more) had a great formula with All In The Family, and he applied it perfectly to Sanford and Son.

If you're unfamiliar with this sitcom, bottom line is that Fred runs a junkyard with his son, Lamont, and Fred's wife passed away leaving the two men to also run the household. But who could possibly not have at least seen a rerun of this classic show with its memorable theme tune?

This collection is as ageless as it is priceless. Some of the season 3 and season 4 episodes are without Redd Foxx due to contract issues, and that was a shame and absolutely effected the genius of the show. Thank goodness it was only a total of 8 or 9 episodes.

And, speaking of price, at the time of this writing it seems a bit cheaper if you buy all 6 DVD seasons separately instead of the 6-season box set that Amazon is offering.

Either way, hit the add to cart button. This is the big one! I'm comin', Elizabeth!",1150416000,3,1372,4.446215139442231

Dont buy this trash but buy the other ones!",1145232000,2,147,4.25
2259722,5,B0008JIJ1K,"Sanford and Son was made from 1972-1977, and aired during these seasons, beginning in January, 1972.  The episodes in the 6th season are from 1976-77, and were the final season in the series, although the cast were not aware of this at the time.  Some of these episodes are very funny and have the typical Redd Foxx/Demond Wilson give and take, quarreling father/son chemistry, but some are not as funny, and less spontaneous.

First gripe:  I find Fred Sanford's constant insults of his sister in law, Esther Anderson (LeWanda Page) to become monotonous and over the top, and too much to be funny. Sanford could have done one or two insults, but in some episodes, there are so many insult remarks made one after another, it doesn't seem funny and becomes rather dry, plus bogs down the flow of the episode.  Sometimes LESS IS MORE.

Second gripe: ""The Hawaiian Connection"" seems odd, as it tries to incorporate a ""Hawaii 5-0"" theme into Sanford and Son, and it doesn't quite work.  Somehow, Redd Foxx's junkyard humor doesn't cut it on a vacation in tropical Hawaii.

Really, this is mostly high quality, and of the same caliber as the earlier episodes, but some of the acting seems less inspired and spontaneous, and like some of the ""magic"" of the first 4 seasons is missing.  You may disagree, but this is what I found with repeated viewings.  Still, it is worth having, along with the earlier seasons.",1130198400,10,1406,4.725409836065574

2259730,5,B0008JIJ1K,"Nominated for six Golden Globes and seven Emmys, including Outstanding Series - Comedy, Sanford & Son became one of the first shows in television history to be almost entirely centered around African-American characters. Modeled after the British TV show Steptoe & Son, the series showcased the underappreciated talents of comic genius Redd Foxx (whose skin color and bad language prevented him from becoming a superstar decades earlier). The brainchild of All In The Family creator Norman Lear, Sanford & Son signaled the beginning of a decade of sitcom classics for the prolific 1970's TV writer - Maude (1972), Good Times (1974), and The Jeffersons (1975) being the others. Wrought with memorable one-liners and well-timed humor, Sanford & Son was a Top 10 Nielsen rated show every year in which it aired except for its final season (ranking a respectable #27)...

Sanford & Son, set in the Watts district of Los Angeles, follows the life of Fred Sanford (Redd Foxx), a 65-year-old African-American junk dealer who shares his business with his 34-year-old son Lamont (Demond Wilson). With Fred's wife Elizabeth having passed away twenty years earlier, he often evokes Lamont's sympathy by clutching his heart and proclaiming, ""Oh, I'm coming to join you Elizabeth!"" But Fred always survives those near fatal heart attacks, continuing to disperse sarcastic putdowns (often directed at his sister-in-law Esther) and racist stereotypical remarks aimed against whites and Hispanics (especially Lamont's friend Julio). Using guilt to manipulate his ambitious son into staying and helping run the salvage shop instead of pursuing other endeavors, Fred Sanford spends most of his days lounging around the house (his junk store and home are one and the same) and hanging out with his friends - Grady, Melvin, and Bubba... Well-written and hilarious, Sanford & Son is comedian Redd Foxx at his absolute best...

The Sanford & Son (Season 6) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""The Hawaiian Connection: Part 1"" in which three jewel thieves conspire to smuggle some stolen jewels from Hawaii to Los Angeles. When Fred hops a flight to Hawaii to attend a Junkmen of America conference, the thieves plant the jewels on Fred in the hopes of using him as a dupe to carry out their nefarious plan... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""The Winning Ticket"" in which Fred becomes the victim of a con game by a pair of crooks who convince him to run a $500 raffle promotion for Sanford & Son, and ""A Matter of Silence"" in which Fred nearly goes deaf due to the wax buildup in his ears...

2259731,5,B0008JIJ1K,"As you start from season one and work your way forward, you begin to see all of the classic elements that made this show such a huge success come together.

The first seasons were based upon episodes of the British sitcom ""Steptoe and Son"".  In those first seasons, most of the action centered around Fred and Lamont.  Some of their friends would pop in from time to time, but mostly it focused on the relationship between them.

Move forward a bit and the cast of regulars began to grow as the show picked up speed.  First it was Rolo and Bubba, then Smitty the cop and it truly found it's stride with the introduction of Ralo Whitman Mayo as Grady and Lawanda Page as Aunt Esther.

This final season features a number of cameos which make it worth the price, like when Fred meets B.B. King.  But for what it's worth the all time classic Sanford and Son cameo shows up in this season where Fred meets... Redd.  In this episode Redd Foxx does a cameo as himself!  It's a great way to see the line blurred between Redd Foxx the actor and Fred G. Sanford, the character.",1116806400,6,1068,4.353535353535354
2259732,5,B0008JIJ1K,"Although (as other reviewers have noted) the show started to decline after season three, season six provided some wonderful laughs.  My personal favorite is the episode with Riley King (B.B. King's real name).  He performs his standard ""How Blue Can You Get"" and the episode is hysterical.  Redd Foxx was a classic comedian and Demond Wilson was a perfect straight man. Add all of the other memorable charcters to the mix (Bubba Bexley, Grady Wilson, Aunt Ester et al) and few will argue that ""Sanford and Son"" was a great comedy.",1116288000,4,530,4.802197802197802
2259733,5,B0008JIJ1K,"Redd Foxx- So many took from him, and he gave us much more. He gave us laughter. Laughter is the greatest gift of all, and he had the gift to give, and still keeps giving after all these years after his death in 1991. The most memorable episode in season 6 is the ""Hawaii 2-pt episode"". I always looked forward to this one on tv-land. When ever I hear the ""Hawaii 50"" theme, I don't think of ""Hawaii 50"", I think of Fred G.Sanford in his Hawaiian flower covered shirt and straw hat. I have been waiting for this DVD release patiently, and look forward to June 7th.",1113696000,7,564,4.231481481481482
2259734,5,B0008JIJ1K,"I can not give less than 5 stars for this show, I am very thankfull that all seasons of this show are released.

2- The Royal Family (1st Telecast Sept. 18, 1991 until May 13, 1992).

2259735,5,B0008JIJ1K,All of Sanford & Son seasons 1 thru 6 I'm glad that amazon brought them all out on DVD I grew up on Sanford and Son Redd Foxx  was the greatest RIP. Thank you Amazon for bringing them all out on DVD.

2259736,4,B0008JIJ1K,"Here's a breakdown of how I rate the first five seasons of Sanford and Son, all of which I currently own on DVD.

1st Season:  Excellent, classic TV.

2nd Season:  Show gets even better, with classic episodes such as ""The Card Shaps"" and ""The Puerto Ricans are Coming.""

3rd Season:  The absolute best the series ever was, with one great episode after another.

4th Season:  With Redd Foxx gone for the first part of the season, the show began to slip.

5th Season:  The show hit its lowest.

Though the sixth season isn't out on DVD yet, I have seen most episodes when they reran on TV Land.  I think the show was making a slight comeback from the fifth season.  Episodes like ""Aunt Ester Has a Baby,"" ""Carol,"" and ""Fred Meets Redd"" are very funny.  My favorite 6th season episode was ""Funny, You Don't Look It"" where Fred thinks he's a king.  These shows are very good, and I can't wait to own the DVD!",1112659200,9,904,4.36144578313253
2259737,3,B0008JIJ1K,"By the time Sanford and Son returned for it's sixth season in 1976,not only has issue oriented sitcoms(All In The Family,Good Times) lost their foothold in the Nielsons and replaced by more family friendly shows (Happy Days,Laverne & Shirley,What's Happening!),but the show's quality had erode to the point that it's audience had tuned elsewhere.

 After four high rated seasons,S&S sucumb to poor writing, gratuitous guest stars(like celebraties would visit a junkyard), and cheap ratings catching gimmicks (the Hawaii episode and the Redd foxx lookalike contest).

At the end of the 6th season,the two stars quit,and the next season the show was retooled as The Sanford Arms featuring Teddy Wilson along with the supporting cast. The show only lasted few episodes before it was officially cancelled. In 1980,Sanford premiered sans Demond Wilson. Lacking the chemestry of the previous show,it was cancelled after a year a half later.",1112400000,11,934,5.383561643835616
