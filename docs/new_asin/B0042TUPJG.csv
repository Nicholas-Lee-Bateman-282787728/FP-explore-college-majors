8413953,5,B0042TUPJG,"This documentary on Vivaldi's life and music is based on extended interviews with several very different Vivaldi devotees. It is quirky, informative, and lots of fun. I watched it - then watched it again, twice -- it's that good. If you have an interest in Vivaldi, or in classical music in general, you must have this DVD.  It's apparently scarce, but well worth digging for.",1350259200,,376,4.7846153846153845
