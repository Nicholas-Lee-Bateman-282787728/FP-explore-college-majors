1759520,5,B00006HMPB,"Wonderful movie.  Deeply touch my heart.
The title of my review is the thought that ran through my mind when as I watched the movie.
It is at its heart a Christian movie at a time in history when Christians across the globe are being persecuted, jailed, and killed for the simple act of professing their belief in Christ.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone willing to open their heart, feel the truth, and/or willing to be touched by God and Christ.
I acknowledge that after watching this movie I did open my heart to Christ and allow him into my life and heart.  He also removed the hard stone from my heart.

Instead, I recommend seeing this movie and letting your heart open to its truth.
Definitely worth buying!  And sharing with your friends and loved ones.  Just don't expect everyone to be as deeply touched.  One must be ready first.",1035936000,5,993,4.428571428571429
1759521,5,B00006HMPB,I just wanted to say I love newest movie from the Left behind series!!! I thought it was better than the first! A must see for everyone!!  I hope they come out with more movies on this series!!God Bless,1035849600,3,202,4.17948717948718
1759522,2,B00006HMPB,"My advice is that you save your money. Given the popularity of the book series, they could have put more time, effort, and perhaps money into the movie. The first movie was just lame. Don't expect much from this one either.",1035504000,,223,4.463414634146342
7968971,1,B00006HMPB,"I saw this movie yesterday because I wanted to see how Cloud Ten Pictures handled the rest of the series, as the first movie was absolutely atrocious-the scenes in Israel were shot at a rock quarry in Toronto, and it looked so fake, not to mention that it barely resembled the first novel at all. I asked myself, ""Could it only get worse?"" the answer is a resounding YES. The 2nd movie was even worse. There's a scene that looked like it came straight out of ""The Way Of The Master,"" a program co-hosted by Kirk Cameron. Tim Lahaye sued Cloud Ten Pictures & Namesake Entertainment for breach of contract and a settlement was eventually reached which allows Reverend LaHaye to remake the films. (According to what I read somewhere, he wants to make the films a big-budget Hollywood-style production. that is the only way to go with the series. anyone who has read and loved the books might well agree that a screenplay based on the books should be faithful to the source material. Good actors and excellent special effects also factor in. All of that the three films sorely lacked, not to mention that the ""Actors"" with the exceptions of Chelsea Noble & Gordon Currie (albeit acquitting himself for only for a few scenes) are good. Kirk Cameron WAS NOT Buck Williams. He was too wimpy for the part. See him in ""Fireproof,"" in which he's much better. If you love the books, DON'T waste your money on these trashy movies. Leave them Behind.",1283040000,,1437,4.6171875
7968972,5,B00006HMPB,"The movie ""Tribulation Force"" does an excellent job of following the events from the book.  The movie opens with Buck Williams, played superbly by Kirk Cameron, on television analyzing the events of the past week.  People are still confused as to what has really happened.  Many have chose to commit suicide, but Buck, Chloe, Rayford (Brad Johnson), and Bruce Barnes know the real truth; the rapture has occurred.
Meanwhile, the United Nations has called upon Nicolae Carpathia, played wonderfully by Gordon Currie, to lead the world through this time of confusion.  However, only Buck, Rayford, Chloe, and Bruce know Carpathia for what he really is: the Antichrist. The four friends thus have set up the ""Tribulation Force"", a group of believers who will spread the gospel to anyone at any time. Carpathia has made it his sole mission to destroy the Christian faith.  Rayford manages to get hired as Carpathia's personal pilot, and the force heads to Israel for the signing of the peace treaty.  It is here that we meet Tsion Ben-Judah, a Jewish Rabbi who has spent huge amounts of time researching the world events and he's come to the conclusion that only Jesus Christ could have caused them, much to the dismay of Nicolae and the joy of Bruce Barnes, who yells ""praise God"" in celebration.
I've read each book in the ""Left Behind"" series, and I thought this movie and the first one did an excellent job of following the books.  The actors chosen for each role were perfect as well.  There is an advertisement at the beginning of the film for the 3rd film installment.  I can't wait for it to come out.  I'm sure it will be just as good as the first 2 were.  If you've read the books of this series or if you just like good movies with a strong message, then this movie is definitely for you.",1041984000,48,1795,4.630914826498422

In every way that counts, Tribulation Force, the second installment in the Left Behind film series, is the first film's equal, at least when it comes to tone and spirit. However, this one is better than the first. Director Bill Corcoran has done a
tremendously well done film. Tribulation Force is more enhanced than the first installment, enhancing the religious message. Yet, amazingly, Corcoran manages to enhance the Gospel message without shoving it down the viewer's throats, and although it does get a tad bit preachy at times, it is nonetheless a very vivid and well done continuation of the Left Behind saga.
The film opens with Cameron ""Buck"" Williams reporting live from GNN Studios, reporting on the mass chaos and anarchy that has engulfed the entire world caused by the disappearance of hundreds of millions of people suddenly vanishing into thin air.
Thousands upon thousands have perished in accidents caused by the vanishings. Mass numbers are choosing suicide. And martial law is in effect worldwide. The world looks to Nicolae Carpathia for hope. He is seen as a savior of mankind. The four post-rapture Christians, Buck, Rayford Steele, Chloe Steele, and Bruce Barnes are the ones who see him as he really is - the Antichrist - the one who will slaughter every Christian he can possibly find. As Bruce Barnes puts it, ""Becoming a Christian in this time of tribulation is just like marking yourself for death."" The four companions are determined to spread the Gospel message to any who will listen, despite the persecution they know will ensue. Bruce is an expert on end-times prophecy and the other three learn of the coming judgements - the Antichrist will rule the planet, a devastating war will erupt, worldwide famine will strike, and a fourth of mankind will perish. With even worse judgements still to come after that. Throughout the film, the first judgement takes place, and Carpathia conquers the world through diplomacy.
Then, Ray Steele takes a job flying Nicolae's private plane simply because he knows the Truth and must find information concerning Carpathia. Buck goes along. They land in Israel and Buck and Rayford meet Rabbi Ben-Judah in Jerusalem. Buck figures one sure-fire way to get the Truth out to the world is to somehow infiltrate the Wailing Wall, which has been closed off and is very heavily gaurded by the Israeli militia because of the mass controversy and mystery centering around the two Witnesses, the ones prophesied in ancient Scripture as the ones who would raise up the 144,000 witnesses from all over the world. Buck uses the cover that he wants to discredit the Witnesses, thus convincing Ben-Judah to accompany him. They are supernaturally spared from the deadly threat of the heavily armed gaurds and find themselves in the presence of the two witnesses., where Buck, using his GNN rights granted to him by Nicolae himself, records the Witnesses speaking out truths of God. Then, suddenly, the gaurds attack! As Buck and Ben-Judah try to take cover, the two Witnesses  suddenly breathe out fire from their mouths and the gaurds are incinerated, engulfed in flames. When Buck returns to Rayford, he learns that the broadacast got cut.
But Rayford has acquired information from Carpathia's computer files, and the two of them check it out, discovering that the file is a listing of Messianic prophesies that the Antichrist is comparing to himself. Nicolae is planning on using this as a speech that Ben-Judah will declare to the world . They realize they must change the speech in order to attempt once again to get the Truth out to the world.
Although this film has more of a somewhat pastoral setting than the first one did, it is nonetheless very worthwhile. When one thinks about it, the main quibble is that one would have to see the first film before seeing this film. It is somewhat mandatory. Tribulation Force picks up a week after the the events of Left Behind. The first film had no real ending, since it is picked up with almost seamless continuity. You will no doubt be confused if you see this film without having seen the first one, because hey, first things first! But that is a very minor inconvenience.
Tribulation Force has no real beginning and no real ending. Yes, there will be a third Left Behind. This second installment, like the first one, has a cliffhangar ending. A short trailor for Left Behind 3 is shown before the feature presentation, at least on th VHS.",1041638400,4,4469,4.895778364116095
7968974,1,B00006HMPB,"i think that the greatest problem for Evangelical filmmakers is that they don't understand moral conflict - you're either saved or not.  There's no in between, hence they see nothing exciting or don't know how, I'm not sure, to write morally conflictive scenes, where there's a spiritual and temporal threat to the characters.  Hence, they write dialogue-heavy, overbearing and certainly unrealistic ""religiousy"" dialogue, as though that were all that's needed to resolve every crisis, however dramatically interesting.  Get a real writer for the next film, please.  And don't be so darn cheap with the budget - you made lots on the 1st film.",1040256000,4,642,5.203883495145631
7968975,5,B00006HMPB,"Wow! This is one the best Christian Movies Series ever! Congratulations to Cloud Ten Pictures for their awsome work.
They have managed to do a wonderful movie that has become a bestseller almost overnight, even with their limited resources. I hope they keep making movies on all the Left Behind books, which by the way, I happen to own.
Left Behind II has a wonderful and clear message that is sure to reach millions of unbelievers with the gospel of Christ.
That alone is enough reason to support movies like this, because our goal as christians is to reach out to people using every method that we can.
Those negative reviewers don't even know what they're talking about. I have a few answers to the questions that some of the reviewers  have posted: Why do you think that the End-Times subject is so hot now? Just watch the news or read today's headlines! Everything that the Bible predicts is coming to pass right before our eyes! And where were these people on September 11, 2001? That looked like a scene from Left Behind come true! And there are plenty of Christian movies on other subjects. Have you checked your Christian Bookstore lately?
(But you don't have to be a wizard to know which ones are the bestsellers, right?)
Believers, the time to share the gospel is now, and with the unfolding current events people are showing a growing interest in the End-Times Prophecies. So if you don't want to hear or see more about this subject, I sugest you move to a remote island somewhere, were you won't have access to any mode of information and communication, and stop wasting your time writing bad reviews.
You bought the movie and watched it, so mission accomplished!
TOUGH LUCK!",1038268800,,1688,4.683501683501683

7968977,3,B00006HMPB,"Left Behind II is better, because the producers realized they had tried to do too much with the first film.  Like the Apocalypse series, the Left Behind movies do best with church audiences and those who are interested in Christian spirituality.  This sequel embraces this reality, and is better for it.  Additionally, the first film tried to pack an entire novel into 94 minutes, resulting in a  disjointed and confusing plot--not good for a story that is based on the complexities of end times theology!  #2 breaks the Tribulation Force novel in half, and does a much better job of telling the tale.
Several of the characters blossomed in this sequel.  Chloe's anger, determination and tenderness come through more naturally this time.  Nicolae seems older and more malevolent, without becoming an exaggerated persona.  Great stuff!  Both Captain Steele and Pastor Bruce also seem to catch their stride this time.
On the down side, there is less tension this time.  The film feels more like a TV series, than a action-suspense movie.  The pace is a bit plodding.
In one word, Left Behind II was ""interesting,"" and as such garners three stars.",1036886400,13,1144,4.93717277486911
7968978,2,B00006HMPB,I saw Left Behind and Left Behind II.  Unfortunately I paid for them.  They both should have stayed left behind on the store shelf.  I WOULD NOT recommend either of these movies to any one!  I will be spending my money on the Apocolypse Series.  Much better made and a great story line!  If you really want GOOD Christian movies with a backbone (that could go to the theaters) I would recommend that you NOT BUY this movie!  Purchase the Apocolypse series with Nick Mancuso and STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES!!!,1036800000,,522,4.48936170212766
