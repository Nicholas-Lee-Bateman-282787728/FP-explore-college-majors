1383642,1,B00004ZBP6,"If you want to see the worst acting in the history of film-making -- WATCH THIS MOVIE.
The plot: A professor, his student, a psychic and a cameraman go to an abandoned building, once an insane asylum, now supposedly haunted. These are the frightening methods of torture you will be subjected to:
-- A good third of the movie seems to be the professor reciting the history of the building. This is all done in the typical falsetto voice of very bad actors who think that, when you act, you must raise the voice an octave or two. Once in a while he slips and lets his natural voice come through. He should have stuck to it.
-- The psychic is played by an actress who apparently needed a cue every single time to say her next line.
-- The student has no idea what regular speech sounds like. Her intonations wouldn't match was she was saying. I've met people like that -- they're usually on medication.
-- The cameraman, despite being a marginally better actor than the rest, played a despicable character who needed a good tail-kicking.
A full 95% of the movie was dialogue -- there were times where I was tempted to fast forward because they simply wouldn't *shut up*! There were absolutely no thrills, no suspense, no interest, NOTHING.
The few moments where it was attempted to create some sort of paranormal or frightening scene was a joke. One scene has the psychic ""channeling"" (allowing a spirit to talk through her), and it was done by her talking and two very badly done male voices speaking at the same time as her.
This movie is passed off as, allegedly, FBI tapes that were ""found"" when the four people were found to be missing (Blair Witch, anyone?). They should've lost the tapes, too.
In fact, just watch Blair Witch again. You'll be better off.",1058486400,3,1758,4.548895899053628
1383643,5,B00004ZBP6,A FILM CREW GOES INTO A HAUNTED ASYLUM AND DISAPPEARS 3 DAYS LATER. THEIR FILMED FOOTGAE IS ALL THAT IS FOUND. SOUNDS LIKE A 'BWP' RIP OFF BUT THIS MOVIE IS NOT THAT EASY TO LABEL. THIS JOINS THE BWP AS ONE OF THE BEST ORIGINAL HORROR MOVIES ALONG WITH THE LAST BROADCAST AND THE SAINT FRANCESVILLE EXPERIMENT. A SCENE NEAR THE END WHERE YOU ARE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO COME THROUGH A DOOR SEEMS TO LAST FORVEVER. SCARED ME BAD. WILL DEFINATLY MAKE YOU THINK.,991094400,4,458,4.337209302325581
1383644,1,B00004ZBP6,"This was terrible. I am a fool for believing any slightly positive comment about this. Don't waste your time, if you do at least tell others that you wasted your time on something absolutely terrible!",1521331200,,200,4.742857142857143
1383645,4,B00004ZBP6,Another paranormal team investigation in a shut down asylum. Typical sketchy filming and the dialog was not great. Story line was good.,1428019200,,135,5.181818181818182
1383646,1,B00004ZBP6,"A terrible poor acted confusing ""found footage"" movie. Fans of found footage should stay away from this one unless you get a free rental. However,there is one plus about Strawberry Estates...the bonus features happen to include 4 or 5 short (15 mins) found footage stories THAT ARE BETTER THAN THE MAIN FEATURE!!!",1412121600,,313,5.038461538461538
1383647,3,B00004ZBP6,"...so let me just say that I give the premise an ""A""... but for acting I'll have to give it a ""D-"" at best. The professor, when he was in the obsessed ""mad scientest"" mode, was just plain hokey. The most believable of all the characters was the cameraman, Jason. Not a bad entry into the entire ""found footage"" genre, but it is definitely low-ranking. HOWEVER... The extras were interesting. There were about four or five short stories that, to me, made this purchase valid.",1367193600,,474,4.588235294117647
1383648,2,B00004ZBP6,"Ever see the movie The Blair Witch whatever?  This film was worse!!!  I hate that I bought it! I'm sure I've seen worse, but can't remember what.",1358640000,,145,4.333333333333333
1383649,1,B00004ZBP6,I will save time from how I feel about this movie as the title above says it all. Service was top notch and will buy from this vendor again but the film itself (if you can even call it that) was beyond poor from beginning to the hard to watch end. Where these even actors or was there a script?? Plain awful. Save your money people.,1174348800,2,332,4.045454545454546
1383650,1,B00004ZBP6,"I am a B-movie fan, but this was bad. The box tricked me into renting it. Please rent this before you buy it. I want my three dollars back!",1139184000,2,139,3.8275862068965516
1383651,4,B00004ZBP6,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is no Blair Witch, not even close. But it does deliver a few chills. The story here is a group of 4 go into a haunted asylum to find ""answers"" on what is going on there. If the last 8 minutes don't creep you out, then I don't know what will.",1119571200,5,272,3.789473684210526
1383652,5,B00004ZBP6,what a completly original and scary movie. very interesting to think about in those few seconds after the movie ends.,1088380800,2,117,4.9
1383653,5,B00004ZBP6,"While watching the film I started to notice myself getting more involved in the story.  At first I was a little annoyed with the Proffesor in the film but mid way through I realized that he is just a rambling idiot who is so into himself that he does not see the big picture.  The big picture is the very entertaining film behind the film Strawberry Estates.  I consider Estates not a Blair Witch Rip off because this film is more believable. The footage has video drop out. Sound problems and everything that a real documentary would have if it was never put together and edited profesionally. There is no gore, nudity but the end will sure spook you out.  Make sure you watch it will no lights on and at night.  Also watch it with someone who does not talk through movies.  I personally hate those Yappy Yappy types.  The movie will start out slow.  It builds itself into one heck of a spook show.  Very well put together.  The bonus stuff ""ROCKS"" there are hidden features.  A few short films.  The behind the story on Strawberry Estates is the best.  It is a film about the first verson of Strawbery Estates with Debbie Rochon and Tina Krause.  Ron Bonk put together a very entertaining film.  I like it better than Vicious Sweet.",1075334400,6,1234,4.446428571428571
7928362,3,B00004ZBP6,"When I started watching this film I hated it.  It started so slow, so over the top bad. But I could see potential.  Exploring a haunted asylum sounds like a great premise for a horror movie.  But the acting from Jennifer and Dr Laurel was so atrocious, and Dr Laurel was such a jerk.  I hated listening to the oral history of the asylum.  I wanted to bail.  There were several times I wanted to bail.  The first time was when the discussion of God got brought up.  I thought for certain the film would take a religious slant.  The last time was when Dr Laurel and Jennifer did a controlled possession and the demon's echoed voice over Jennifer's was annoying.  But I stuck with the movie.  All hour and 41 minutes.  The ending was actually good.  If the film had only been the very beginning and the very end, it would've been a 5 star film.  Instead it gets 3 just for the ending.",1525219200,,881,4.260606060606061
7928363,1,B00004ZBP6,"You know, I have seen some really bad found footage films. Lots of them actually. This one though... It is the worst yet. Acting was terrible, Camera work was horrendous, and the script was stupid. About 30 mins of the movie was spent discussing if god was real or not, twice and between 2 sets of people saying the same thing over and over. There wasn't even anything supernatural in this film. Hard pass on this people. Waste of time.",1524614400,,436,4.4625
7928364,1,B00004ZBP6,"Some films have potential but are ruined by swearing. American English has turned to slang without the help of profanities, so when I want to be entertained by a story, why do I have to listen to young adults diminish the language more with their inadequate grasp pf words for which they compensate with profane fillers? I'd rather hear ""ya know"" and ""stuff like that"" and throat clearing than this disgusting excuse for dialogue.",1524528000,,430,4.824324324324325
7928365,5,B00004ZBP6,"Don't be put off by the poor reviews. I think the biggest surprise of the this movie was the level of acting, which was superb. If more indie movies used well thought out plots and good actors (such as this one), then maybe more people would see them. Mr. Bonk definitely has a future in the business if his standards stay this high.
I am sure many people would draw comparisons to ""Cannibal Holocaust"", or ""The Blair Witch Project"", but I believe this film stands out on it's own. It is the story of a documentary filmed in a haunted asylum. As you would expect in a horror movie, bad things happen: as a fan and supporter of independent films, I suggest you seek this film out, therefore I will leave the plot details out. Enjoy!",1523059200,,731,4.382352941176471
7928366,1,B00004ZBP6,"This like almost all of the U.K. Haunted , shows are just plain - Boring nonsense.",1522454400,,82,4.1875
7928367,1,B00004ZBP6,This movie stank. The acting was terrible and the plot reeked. I don't know how people could rate it higher than a 1.,1522195200,,117,4.130434782608695
7928368,1,B00004ZBP6,"Abysmal acting, insultingly bad dialog, atrocious production value, etc.

I had to bail out at the ""Does God exist?"" scene.",1522108800,,123,5.15
7928369,3,B00004ZBP6,I liked this. It is long and drawn out but I watched it.,1521676800,,56,3.3846153846153846
7928370,4,B00004ZBP6,"I really liked this film.  They did a lot of building up of the story for the first half of the movie with very little action, which is typical of this genre, but the last half hour is really creepy.  Overall I think they could have shaved about 20 minutes off the film because there were a few unnecessary scenes, but overall a decent watch.",1521504000,,342,4.246153846153846
