8700828,5,B00DTX84EE,"Great to have if you want to understand Balanchine's style and their pointe ""philosophy"".
Detailed explanation of each pointe step and how to execute it properly aka Balanchine style by Ms Suki Schorer with occasional filler by Ms Merrill Ashley.

I'm so glad I bought it!",1420070400,3,399,4.882352941176471
