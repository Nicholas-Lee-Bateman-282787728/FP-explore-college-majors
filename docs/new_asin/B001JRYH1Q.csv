3659641,1,B001JRYH1Q,"When thinking jonny quest one things of great animation, quality work, story's that make sense.

This re-incarnation of Jonny Quest has none of these things. The cgi art is terrible and painful to watch. The 2d work was no better. The dvd it's self it fine but the contents should be burned for making such a mockery of a good thing. The story lines were nothing like anything that would have appeared in real jonny quest.

I was surprised at all the positive reviews for this show. I urge everyone to watch the real jonny quest (1964) and then tell me that this is still a good show.

jonny quest fans have been writing this show of for ages and it will continue to happen because it's a bad show. It follows nothing about the original and should not be jonny quest.",1236384000,8,767,4.387323943661972
3659642,5,B001JRYH1Q,"As an avid fan of what I hold to be the best American cartoon of the 90s, and certainly of my youth, I was one of the first in line to preorder this dvd collection.  My zeal in getting this payed off, as this dvd collection does not disappoint. The video quality is superb, far better than the homemade VHS tapes that we've been strung along with for these past 12-13 years.  (I cannot believe that it has been so long.)

Testifying to the quality of the shows does not tell much of the quality of the dvds; it is already known that the shows themselves were awesome.  The special features are what make a dvd pack.  There is, sadly, only one special feature on this set, and that is the ""Modernizing a Classic"" segment where creators of this incarnation of the show speak for about 12 minutes, revealing their insight in creating an epic show.

One minor complaint about that special feature is that it tantalizes the viewer with short glimpses at rare material such as character art and biographies, as well as concept art. I know that I would be most appreciative if this material was put out, and I am sure that I am not the only one.  Some of this material could do well in a DVD pamphlet to be bundled inside the box, as the inside of this box is barren, and it has empty clips just begging for a pamphlet to hold.

As another suggestion, I present the motion to include the ""lost episode"" that was featured in many preview clips, and which contributed many scenes (Jessie on horseback, Jonny running from the attack helicopter) to the Canyon Intro of each episode.

My desire is that the dvd publishers will take these suggestions that we have made to heart, and allow them to manifest in the next dvd bundle of the series (3 more to go), but my sincere hope is that everyone who was a fan will pick up this classic so that the show will not die another death.",1235606400,5,1867,4.357348703170029
3659643,5,B001JRYH1Q,This is a great update to the original Jonny Quest and everyone should own it.  I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released!,1235433600,16,135,4.0
3659644,4,B001JRYH1Q,"Warner Brothers finally decided to break out this gem. Before this DVD set came out the ONLY offering on DVD was a dinky single episode DVD (Escape to Questworld was the episode) with no stereo track or extras of any kind. This two disk DVD set gives you 13 episodes and a bonus interview/retrospective with the show's producers. Oh yeah... full stereo audio and English subtitles (you really can't expect surround sound for a 90's cartoon).

The Real Adventures of Johnny Quest is a re-imaging of the classic 60's television. Don't expect the same kind of format that the old one had to be here. It's not really even in the same spirit as the classic series. For one in the old series it was mainly the adults (Dr. Benton Quest and Race) who did much of the problem solving and Johnny was mostly an active spectator. This time around Johnny and his friends are the ones solving the problems. The problems are also not quite the same, but then again we already have the classic series to enjoy. This one may be different, but it stands on its own merits.

When I first watched this show I was a bit put off. One of the things that bugged me was the show seemed to try hard to be cutting edge with the use of some computer generated animation scenes that were used when anybody went into a virtual reality called Questworld. As off putting as this was at first when I finally sucked it up and just saw the show for how the plot develops it was clear this wasn't some flash in the pan production. Eventually the whole Questworld thing kind of phased out of the series in turn for more plots involving the real world. I won't go so far as to say it's as groundbreaking as the original, but I will say they were pretty creative with this show.

While I am glad to see the show finally get some DVD rotation I am disappointed that Warner Brothers went the cheap route and only made a partial release. Considering there are only 52 episodes created that amounts to not much more footage than a first season of shows like Heroes or 24. At this rate Warner Brothers will have to make two more collections for you to get the whole series. Why not put the entire series on one DVD set and get ALL of the fans on board the first time around? Testing the waters? Too scared to simply go for it? Too cheap or greedy maybe?

The Real Adventures of Johnny Quest has a lot of the same elements of the original shows with globe-trotting to exotic locales and brush-ups with high technology while at the same time having a very different look and feel. It's not a bad change, mind you. Fans of the original should still like this. The writing is much better that a lot of what was out there in those days and it's even better than most of what's coming out now.",1234828800,54,2743,4.341130604288499
3659645,5,B001JRYH1Q,I have been waiting FOREVER for this show to come out on DVD! It can't be compared to the older version. I can't wait for this to release! Got my preorder!,1226966400,2,155,4.032258064516129
3659646,5,B001JRYH1Q,"It has now been some years since the release of the original JQ. This was welcomed by fans as the BEST animated ""sci-fi"" series ever. The New Adventures are just as good as the originals (keep the evolution in technology out of the comparison and look at the quality of episode writing and content to compare).
A surprise is that the 13 episode Second season rarely (if ever) surfaces in any discussion of Jonny Quest! All S2 episodes are good (some GREAT) and worthy of release. Fans should join together to get these episodes released so we can enjoy the COMPLETE series.
Please add to Amazon reviews so we can let the studio's know demand exists for the 13 episode season 2!!!",1226534400,28,679,4.573770491803279

A few  years after ""The Real Adventures"" came out, I got into anime.  I feel that JQ: TRA prepared me for that style of ""anything can happen"" animation.  But not every episode is great.  Some seem to preach the politics or eco-mindedness of the people behind it.  That's rather annoying, but overall, this is a great series.",1465430400,,483,4.409090909090909

Anyway this show is dated
I was hoping for more quest world episodes, ha! What a joke. The cgi is very out dated, so bad they walking animation is stiff while the normal animation is great.
Episode: escape to quest world. -sighs face palming, they let a bad guy free and steels thier computers & takes over quest world, are you kidding me? They were that dumb?
4 episodes about saving the animals. BORING! I want adventure & action, not this",1456185600,,607,4.380530973451328
3659662,5,B001JRYH1Q,"There are many things I thoroughly enjoyed as a child that, upon revisiting as an adult, just don't hold the same excitement for me. The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest, on the other hand, is every bit as wonderful a show as I remember it. And I mean EVERY BIT. The characters are engaging, the villains colorful, the action intense, and the animation style eye-catching. Sure, the animation of ""QuestWorld"" is very dated, but the concept is still interesting and its use in storylines is always very fun. I'm shocked that I appreciate the show even more now, viewing it for the first time in so many years. It really has held up beautifully.",1455753600,3,641,4.631578947368421

3659670,2,B001JRYH1Q,"Not sure who thought this was a good idea.  As a kid growing up in the 60's the original Jonny Quest was one of my favorite shows.  Watching it again recently on DVD it holds up extremely well and even my wife who had never seen the series during it's first run enjoyed it.  The show's been well spoofed in the Venture Brothers and clearly serves as a benchmark for other action cartoons from Scooby Doo to the more current Archer.  Out of curiosity I picked this up for a few bucks to see what they'd done with JQ.  If you're an old fan then you'll know you're in trouble from the updated and nauseating opening title sequence.  The modernized makeover of the classic JQ theme music is weak and lacking the surf guitar riffs that made the original theme stand out.  Anyway, Jonny is a teen now as is Hadji.  The visual style and artistry is close to the original but with a darker color palette. The virtual reality ""Questworld"" is annoying, the unnecessary addition of Race's daughter Jesse is clearly attempt to pander to girls in the audience, and the stories lack the excitement and suspense of the originals.  Bandit the dog doesn't show up until half-way through the season and when he does it's only for a moment, in the original show Bandit provides a fair amount of comic relief.  Dr. Quest is pretty much the same but what they've done with Race Bannon is a crime.  He's got a weird haircut, appears physically smaller, and now sports a southern accent and has gotten much chattier spewing endless hokey expressions like he just escaped from Hee-Haw.  Give me the tough and stoic Race and send this hillbilly back to wherever they found him.  Do yourself a favor and skip this depressing attempt to revive a great show.",1433635200,,1730,4.541935483870968

3659679,3,B001JRYH1Q,"Where's season 2? The animation isn't nearly as good as the first series, which was bigger on drama and realism. It wasn't full of obvious jokes, but played to your intellect, not just eye candy. I like this series, but why isn't season 2 out do DVD? I think they strayed too far from what worked, in order to give it broader appeal. It's still fun, just not as good.",1422316800,,367,4.257142857142857

This was one of those experiences. Though the integration of CGI into cartoons back then was novel, it has since been improved many times over. I found the QuestWorld scenes captivating when I was younger, but see them now as being clumsily animated. But that was the time, and I suppose it was good for the time. To be fair, the plots were about what you'd expect: being just slightly more mature than the pap they feed the youngsters nowadays, but nowhere near tolerable to adults.",1400198400,,646,4.725663716814159

One thing I loved about the original Johnny Quest was that it really had a sense of adventure and exploration.  This new series misses those elements horribly.

Unlike the originals (I bought some used on VCR), my kids watched most of these episodes once, but have never bothered to watch again.

3659707,5,B001JRYH1Q,"The original Jonny Quest is a classic that still holds up today, with its good animation, plots & exciting, sometimes violent action.  It set the foundations for the great action cartoons we'd get in the 80s & especially the 90s.  While some episodes were a bit silly, the good ones more than made up for them.  So it made sense to revive it during the 90s, & it's a great continuation with Jonny & Hadji as teenagers, & a new kid character in Race's daughter Jessie Bannon.  Now they face dangers both in the real world & the virtual CGI animated realm of Questworld.  Overall, this is even better than the classic series.  The animation is better (naturally), the humor is funnier, & the plots are more interesting & mature (They don't tone down the level of violence at all.  Some of the deaths are pretty gruesome for a kid's show.).  Some of the episodes are so good (In the Realm of the Condor, Return of The Anasazi) you feel like you're watching little movies.  One thing that should be noted.  Seasons 1 & 2 are a little different from each other.  Admittedly season 2 is by far the best Jonny Quest ever, but season 1 is still excellent.  Here's a review of the episodes.  NOTE: I got the plot descriptions from Wikipedia.

1.  The Darkest Fathoms: Two centuries ago, ruthless pirate Black Jack Lee rode his pirate ship, the Ivory Web to the Bermuda sea floor. When oil explorers are assaulted by a ghost ship under his apparent captaincy, Dr. Quest prepares the Questor for an investigation.  This is a really good episode, but it shouldn't have been the first one.  A

2. Escape To Questworld: Race is hired to contain a nerve gas leak in Chicago, the legacy of a botched raid on Dr. Jeremiah Surd years earlier. When he and Dr. Quest are trapped, it's up to Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji to find the renegade scientist.  Now this should've been the first episode.  It's a tense episode and just feels more like a pilot.  Although Surd is my least favorite of the Quest villains, this is a definite standout of his run.  A

3. In The Realm Of The Condor: The Quest team follows Estella Scheele to find her missing ornithologist grandfather, and ends up finding the lost golden city of El Dorado.  This is an excellent, atmospheric episode.  A+

4. Rage's Burning Wheel: Apocalyptist Ezekiel Rage hijacks the space shuttle carrying Dr Quest and Hadji. Back on Earth, Jonny and Jessie must find a way to stop Rage's apostles who have taken over Mission Control.  This is an excellent episode, but one problem (with the DVD):  This shouldn't have been the first episode with Ezekiel Rage, possibly Hanna-Barbera's greatest villain ever.  If you are reading this & plan on buying this, do me a favor, swap this episode's place with episode 9, and the series will flow a little better.  A+

5. Ndovu's Last Journey: Jonny, Jessie and Hadji track an elephant, Ndovu, as it returns to the elephants' graveyard. On the way, they run into poachers who aren't willing to wait for Ndovu to die.  This is another great episode, with one of the more memorable villain deaths.  A

6. Manhattan Maneater: New York City lives under the threat of a deadly slayer during a trip by Dr. Quest, Hadji and Jonny; they learn that the killer is from a different type of jungle, and become embroiled in a citywide race to eliminate the culprit.  Not the best episode, but still entertaining.  B

7. East of Zanzibar: The Republic of Seychelles has suffered the mysterious wrecks of whaling vessels and the loss of a submarine. Dr. Quest's investigation is hampered when Jonny and Hadji are swept up by a waterspout while sailing.  This is a great episode featuring one of the best characters of the first season, Captain Havell, a man devoted to protecting whales.  A-

8. Assault on Questworld: With Dr. Quest and Race in the Himalayas for a phenomenology conference, Jonny and Jessie are helpless in their attempts to free Hadji, whose mind is being drained by Surd as part of a plan to take over the Quest Compound.  My least favorite episode on the set.  There are moments, but not enough to recommend it.  C

9. Ezekiel Rage: His plea for help turned down, a compromised spy and his family are presumably killed on duty. But when Dr. Quest visits a cave in New Mexico, he finds that Ezekiel Rage--and his anger towards the government--is very alive.  This is the perfect introduction for one of the most sympathetic villains ever (I don't want him to destroy the world, just the people who let his family die).  A+

10. Aliens In Washington: Extraterrestrial transmissions turn out to be warnings to stop a series of space experiments, and the Vice President turns out to be an alien.  An interesting little episode.  B+

11. Return Of The Anasazi: Holding an Anasazi beacon capable of calling the alien fathers of current technology, Alice Starseer is pursued by men in black and asks Dr. Quest for help, whose capture provokes a cross-country rescue by Jonny and Jessie.  This is one of the best episodes of the whole season, with a great guest character in Alice, great action & a great mystery.  A+

12. Alchemist: Dr. Quest is commissioned to find the Philosopher's Stone, which is reputed to turn dross to gold. But when he succeeds, the stone is later stolen from a museum by Quest's partner, who wants to try it out for himself.  This is a little weird, but still a pretty good episode.  B

13. Trouble On the Colorado: Alice Starseer is returning to Earth to lay her grandfather to rest, and Dr. Quest has been invited to attend the ceremony. But Surd & his henchmen lurk among the rapids of the Colorado River, the route to the meeting site.  Her first episode was a bit better, but it's still a great episode.  A

So apart from that one screwup in the chronology, this is a darn good set.  And it gets even better in Season 2.  So buy this set & Volume 2 so Warner Bros. sees the money that can be made and release the second season.",1361404800,,5931,4.5702087286527515
3659708,5,B001JRYH1Q,I watched this series when it came out on Cartoon Network.  I have enjoyed reliving the memories.  The series was good for its time and was a good way of continuing the Johnny Quest cartoons and updating them.,1355529600,,209,4.473684210526316
3659709,5,B001JRYH1Q,"I grew up watching this show after coming home from school. I still remember that epic opening theme and starting up the first episode brought back a lot of great memories. The episodes probably won't be what you remember, but the quality of the DVDs are great and this is only legitimate version I am aware of.

If you are new to the series or only familiar with the originals, this is a good update. Johnny Quest is great because he is an attainable hero. Most of the adventures are realistic enough that younger kids will find it easy to identify with him. More so, the fact that the kids and adults in the show team up to find solutions to tough problems makes this a good example. The show can be violent at times and there is gun play, but non-violence tends to win out and the adults always serve as the voice of reason when it comes to safety. The CGI may be a bit laughable by today's standards, but I just found that added to the nostalgia.

The only downside is that this isn't the entire first season, so keep that in mind when purchasing. It still has plenty of episodes and thus I thought it was well worth the money.",1354233600,2,1131,4.280373831775701
3659710,4,B001JRYH1Q,"These series really remains me my childhood. I know this kind of compilation are meant to be cheap, but they should know that fans might like to pay a little more just to have maybe a little booklet with early draws or some extra information. In the other hand, the brief documentary included in the second DVD is nice, but fans still want more info. That's the only reason I didn't put a 5 star review. The quality of the cartoon and all chapters are really great and it really brought me a lot of memories. I found it in a very low price so my advice is that you should buy it right now. It will be a great excuse to spend time with family or children. I will buy the second volume, because there are some of my favorite chapters of the series. Jonny Quest really RULES!",1348012800,,772,4.1879194630872485
3659711,4,B001JRYH1Q,I loved this show and was thrilled to get season 1 on DVD and am now holding my breathe for season 2 to be released.,1339977600,,116,3.68
3659712,4,B001JRYH1Q,"Only thing I have to say bad about this is that when I got it the DVD divider in the case was broken, but that's no big deal. Also on a couple episodes I noticed it't periodically freeze, but I'm not exactly sure if it's the DVD itself or my DVD player. Other than that it was money well spent.",1336521600,,294,3.9166666666666665
3659713,5,B001JRYH1Q,"I used to watch ""The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest"" on Cartoon Network when it was still airing the show. The series was one of the best on the network. I'm happy to have found this compilation from Season 1 and introduce this series to my kids. I am hoping Hanna Barbera will release the succeeding seasons. I will definitely purchase them. Great product, came as described by seller.",1281916800,,386,4.608695652173913
3659714,5,B001JRYH1Q,I like this show it is as good as when  i first watched as a little kid on cartoon network. I hope they release the other seasons.,1275955200,,130,3.814814814814815
3659715,5,B001JRYH1Q,"Awesome product...very satisfied. It's great to watch these shows again after so long. I bought the DVD, which is in phenomenal and brand new condition btw, and within days it was at my door. Great seller and product!",1271289600,,217,4.7368421052631575
3659716,5,B001JRYH1Q,"One of my favorite tv shows from when I was a kid is finally at long last on dvd!  This show is inventive, action packed, with a solid cast of characters.  It was refreshing to see a female character holding her own with the boys and outshining them sometimes.  Plus it has a kick-a** theme song, hehe.  I really hope they put the remainder of the show on DVD and don't drag out the release for too long....",1262390400,,407,4.17948717948718
3659717,5,B001JRYH1Q,"TRA: Jonny Quest features the first 13 episodes of the series. Although they may seem somewhat similar to episodes of the original Jonny Quest, they feature more of a paranormal feel. I remember watching these on cartoon network all the time along with other classics like Scooby Doo where are you? it has pretty good graphics for the time and nice story line in the beginning. As the story advances the plot seems to get worse. But i would recommend this for its nostalgic feel. Also the extras are pretty good featuring a commentary extra about TRA: Jonny Quest and the original. Can't wait for season one volume two to be released :)",1256428800,,636,4.6371681415929205
3659718,5,B001JRYH1Q,"I am a huge fan of the original series which made for this new series a difficult time to measure up. I enjoyed the shows, especially since they were more fantastic than the original, but I would not say it has replaced the original series in my mind as the real Jonny Quest. For me I probably would rate this a four star, but my son (who is about the age now I was when I watched the orinal series) absolutely loved it. Based on my son's wide eyed response it earned a five star rating from me. The Jonny Quest torch has been passed to a new generation.",1255824000,4,554,4.091743119266055
3659719,5,B001JRYH1Q,This first season was as wonderful as I remembered it being originally.  Would love to buy the next season.,1252108800,,107,4.631578947368421
3659720,4,B001JRYH1Q,"I remember watching this show every week when I was a kid. Now I see that it's a modern version of all those really old shows (like the original Jonny Quest, Scooby-Doo, etc.). The art is kind of dated but still much newer than the old shows I noted, which I really like because it's kind of its own art style. The stories are very similar to the original Jonny Quest so if you're a fan of that it's a must.",1252022400,,407,4.037037037037037
3659721,5,B001JRYH1Q,"I really enjoyed a visit to my past in these 13 episodes, It was an adventure when I greatly needed one. I am looking forward to the release of the rest of the series..If you also enjoyed Jonny Quest growing up and now, then please display your support to persuade Warner Brothers to release further episodes to DVD. thanks",1251244800,,323,4.491525423728813
3659722,3,B001JRYH1Q,"I was so excited to see this release that 'Complete Season One, 13 Episodes' didn't stick out in my head until I actually received the DVD. Thirteen episodes?! Where are the rest of the season? Some of my favorite ones are missing! Heroes? Expedition to Khumbu? This collection is only a blip on the radar of season one! I've been reading other people's reviews, apparently companies will release one season in two sections sometimes? I hope this is true because if we're given only 1/4th of the series I might have a meltdown. How disappointing!",1250467200,7,546,4.757894736842105
3659723,5,B001JRYH1Q,I have always enjoyed jonny quest and am happy with the season 1 volume 1 Set.,1249862400,,78,3.9375
3659724,5,B001JRYH1Q,"We love the original Jonny cuz it's clean and appropriate for kids. However, as we all know, newer cartoons of classics are raunchy. Thanks.",1249430400,,140,4.875
3659725,4,B001JRYH1Q,"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest was something I grew up watching, along with the original version, so I was really happy to see this out!  This series is a super cool remake of the 60's version with Hadji, Jonny, and Race Bannnon's daughter, Jessie as the main focus.  The graphics are redone and the computer world is revamped with a cyber-world known as Quest World with lots of adventures involving the kids and their high tech gadgets.

The only disappointment was the few amount of episodes on this set, and the only reason there were 4 stars.  I wish the whole series was released together, but this is better than the video cassettes that CN Video initially released a while back.  I found a couple of them at the dollar store, but this is lots better.",1243209600,,762,4.532846715328467

Knowing that the complete series is not available is disheartening because i loved the showed, this is a good start with the first 13 episodes, but i want to see the whole series!",1240012800,,257,4.0588235294117645
3659727,5,B001JRYH1Q,"This is such a great show from Cartoon Network's best years. As James Bond got a 90s facelift, so did everyone's favorite spy teen Jonny Quest.

The action is great, the threats are original and horrible and the animation isn't as good looking as the 60s, but better than anything on TV now. Jonny's one-liners are always hilarious. Hadji is awesome and his talents are appreciated more in this series. As the adults always saved the kids in the old one, the kids are now the main heroes. With the progression of weapon technology and the internet, this is the first cartoon to really capitalize on it. Since its animation, this show could pull off cooler ideas without worrying about logic or budget. The tone is really mature and smart dealing with the concept of alien life and terrorism.

This is only the first part of the first season and I hope they release the 2nd season which had alot of the paranormal elements return and had a lot more campy fun like the original series.",1236902400,,983,4.579545454545454

8313676,3,B001JRYH1Q,"The early episodes of ""The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest"" (as can be found in this volume) are not quite up to the standards that the series would eventually reach.
These are the first thirteen episodes of the series run and, while ""Questworld"" is cool, they spend a vast majority of the first few episodes saving the environment in the ""real"" world rather than heading for Questworld and exercising the CGI animation that was supposed to make this series so cutting-edge. (""Realm of the Condor"" and ""Manhattan Maneater"" standout as pretty hokey. In fact, I half-expected the Quest team to suddenly summon ""Captain Planet"" at some point).
Anyway, that's not even the worst part of these ""early"" episodes. You may recall Roger ""Race"" Bannon, the I1 agent hired out to help out Dr. Quest and basically serve as his son's body guard, as a rather stoic tough guy from Illinois. Now, all of a sudden, THIS ""Race"" talks like a reject from Cajun Country. I half-expected him to pack a  deck of exploding playing cards for no reason other than to complete the illusion (...scratch that; that would actually be awesome). Have no worries; come Season 2, Race would mysteriously sound like his former self again.
Okay; so why even bother with three stars? Because I know what this show BECAME around Season 2 where most of my favorite episodes can be found. That and, even in the early episodes, it's clear that Jonny and Hadji are done always being the ones to get into trouble and expect Race and Doctor Quest to bail them out. No; in THIS go around, Jonny, Hadji, and Race's daughter, Jessie, actually SOLVE many of the adventures.
If you're on the lookout for the return of Dr. Quest's nemesis, Dr. Zin, I don't think he returns until Season 2. In THIS volume, look to be introduced to such repeat adversaries as Jeremiah Surd and Ezekial Rage.",1486339200,3,1838,4.708074534161491
