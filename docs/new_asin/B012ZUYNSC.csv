8726818,2,B012ZUYNSC,"This is NOT a sequel to ABCD (Any Body Can Dance), which was a five-star all the way. The only character repeated from the 1st movie was ""Vishnu"", and he was very different. It was so ""Americanized"" that I was severely disappointed with the whole thing. There were fabricated crises, and HUGE plot holes, and even the competition scenes were not that great. Get the original and enjoy that. This one is not good enough to buy.",1527638400,,426,4.545454545454546
