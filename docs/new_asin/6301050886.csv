310421,5,6301050886,"Hopscotch reminds me of some of the great heist films of the 60s, such as ""Charade"" and ""How to Steal a Million"".  Walter Matthau, known for both serious (Charley Varrick, Taking of Pelham 123) and funny roles (Odd Couple) plays an aging CIA agent being forced out of the field.  Glenda Jackson does a great supporting role as his love interest.  This is a film I have seen several times and knowing how well Criterion teats movies decided to buy it.",1515888000,,450,4.530864197530864

310557,4,6301050886,"Much improved over earlier Criterion collection edition (2002).  Seems a bit grainer, though it's sharper, the colors are brighter and more defined than the earlier dvd.  Still a great experience to see it and laugh and have the family watch it with you.  The addition of the Cavett 1980 interview is a minor plus over the previous dvd.",1506470400,,336,4.758620689655173

310559,1,6301050886,"Very poor quality. Worse than DVD version. Resolution and color of poor quality (not really a remaster?). There is no improvement in resolution or quality of the color of this ""remastering"" ... Features on DVD are missing. Fancy re-do of art work, but thats about it.  Whoever did this ""Remaster"" was certainly not aware of the 2K, 4K, or 8K formats or didn't have access to a high quality master. Apparently an ""electronis"" re-format, not an optical remaster. Certainly not worth the upgrade to Blue-Ray format. Not even worth one star ,,,,, will likely return this disc to Amazon.",1506038400,,582,4.878787878787879
310560,5,6301050886,The movie is great. I have seen it at least 10 times.  I bought this to replace my copy which has gone missing during a move. I found the video quality to be lacking. I will be seeking a better copy.,1504483200,,199,3.8536585365853657

310684,5,6301050886,"If you're like me and already have a HOPSCOTCH Criterion Blu-ray in your collection which you ordered in 2008, you may be wondering whether you need another one. Well, mostly the answer is no. I just watched both the old and the new on a 60' enhanced TV and a blu-ray player that also plays 3d and has upgraded a lot of films that were just plain dvds or blus. The 2008 and the 2017 play exactly the same. So although it boasts 2k restoration in this new one - no difference that I can see. If you have a 2008, you have the movie that is as good as it gets - grainy, especially on outdoor scenes and this movie has a lot of outdoor scenes.

So how about features? As far as I can see there's only one new one on the 2017 - That is the Dick Cavett interview with Walter Matthau in 1980. On the 2008 you already have the 2002 interview with the director and the writer. I haven't watched the Dick Cavett interview yet, but getting these two men together should be fun.

That being said, there were some problems with old Criterions in tthe past and this 2008 copy be one of them Check your 2008 copy for white streaks of a powdery substance (my 2008 is OK). Perhaps this is the reason they're coming out with a new one.

If you haven't watched this movie before, you have a real treat in store, twists and turns, comedy and spies. That's why I can't give this movie anything less than a 5. It is worth owning two of them in case I wear one out",1503446400,4,1441,4.102836879432624
310685,1,6301050886,"Great film, wonderful acted, very funny, an instant classic.  But WHY is this BLU RAY sad? A 2K restoration, rather than a 4K, why?  I have the older Criterion DVD's and I almost think they look better than this blu-ray.  So why have they re-released it, doing such a poor job in the viewing perspective.  One of the reasons to update to blu-ray is the higher quality of the image, but this is a disgrace.  I think Criterion owes us a BIG explanation for this.  I may be returning this.  Why spend another $25 for version not any better than the DVD. Usually Criterion is a master company with releases, but after this, I wonder.  I am waiting for someone there to explain this debacle.  That said, my one star is the blu ray, not the film.  Film is a classic, blu ray is a disgrace,  Shame on Criterion for this truly corrupt and disgusting version.  They should be ashamed.  I also see they released ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" another classic, as a 2K release....Something bad is happening at Criterion.  They'd better be careful, their reputation is starting to right down the toilet.  Shame on you.",1503187200,,1100,4.569230769230769
310686,5,6301050886,"The movie is fabulous, but I had very poor resolution. Also stopped and restarted during the complete film......and on line it said movie was $2.99 and then on Roku was $3.99. To whom should I vent my displeasure?",1503187200,,213,4.631578947368421
310687,5,6301050886,"While I love this movie, and have since It first appeared on the screen. I find the statement, that I ""Own This Movie"" to be very inaccurate, to say the very least. I cannot download it to my lap top, I cannot view it off line. In point of fact the statement that ""You Have Purchased and Own this Movie"" to be little more than a lie. I am quite disappointed I Amazon for this.",1503014400,,376,4.026666666666666
310688,5,6301050886,"This is one of Walter Matthau's best movies. And as with all of his movies there is a great background musical score. They picked just the right actor for each character. I was impressed when he asked the man behind the counter if he knew German (not if he spoke German).
Talk about nepotism David Matthau plays Ross and someone needs their eyes checked in the credits. The seaplane pilot was defiantly female (suppose to be his doughtier-in-law)
Walter Matthau plays a top CIA agent who's being confined by office politics (Myerson) to a desk job for not taking out the Russian agent Yaskov played by Herbert Lom. The disgruntled Matthau quits the service and heads to Austria, where he links up with former lover (a fellow ex-agent) Glenda Jackson. All goes smoothly until Matthau acts on the advice of Yaskov, who suggests that Matthau, his memoirs (his life in the CIA.) Spitefully, Matthau sends out copies of his first chapter to the heads of the spy agencies throughout the world--and from that point on, he and Jackson don't have a moment's peace. This delights Matthau: now that all of his former colleagues are chasing after him, he has a reason to get up in the morning. As written by Brian Garfield, Hopscotch was a conventionally serious espionage novel. As adapted for the big screen by Garfield and Bryan Forbes, Hopscotch is a lively exercise in cloak-and-dagger comedy, even when the pursuit of Matthau turns surprising towards the end. There were several different angle takes and depending on your copy you may see Sam Waterston's face when he is standing on the cliff. Other versions show his shadow only.",1500940800,2,1625,4.827956989247312
310689,5,6301050886,"I watch this every November in honor of my father who has passed. It was his favorite film and might very well be mine.  No violence, no murders, just a lot of fun.  Ned Beatty is great as are the rest of the cast.  CIA officer is relegated to a desk by officious bureaucrat and gets his revenge.  I may have watched this twenty times and I still laugh",1500336000,,352,4.057971014492754

310821,4,6301050886,"This movie is delightfully funny, even if you're accustomed to the 21st C. pacing of comedies.  Walter Matthau plays an expert old-school spy who's not appreciated by the neoliberal revolution. You'll get a kick out of this angle, it just gets more relevant with time.  Glenda Jackson plays a strong and capable character who's patient by choice with Matthau's character's foibles.  Her character clearly loves him as an equal and you'd want to see a sequel of their day to day life. The adventures are fun without reaching the level of wackiness, and I forgive any gaps simply for the joy of watching all the characters progress.  ""This is Eleanor Roosevelt..."" has become a familiar cry around our house.",1487635200,5,706,4.907563025210084

310975,5,6301050886,This movie is a lot of fun. Walter Matthau is great in just about anything in which he appears and this vehicle is no exception. The crafty old spy after being demoted to a desk job decides to write a tell-all book and stays one step ahead of the brass that wants him out of the picture by galavanting all over the globe. The beautiful Glenda Jackson is on the caper as well. Light-hearted fare that is quite witty and fun to watch.,1485561600,,432,4.216867469879518

Even though the spy ""technology"" is old, the plot is fresh, funny, takes great turns, and makes use of some of the finest opera music, even cuts from Matthau's personal collection.

311254,5,6301050886,"Hopscotch is about a CIA field agent played by Walter Matthau whose new boss played by Ned Beatty relegates to the file department. Matthau rebels by shredding his file and quitting (he doesn't tell anyone, he just stops going to work). He goes to visit another ex-spy in Slazburg Austria played by Glenda Jackson. While there, a Russian agent played by Herbert Lom tries to recruit him. When he refuses, Lom asks him what he is going to do with the rest of his life, write his memoirs? Matthau decides it's a good idea and so it begins.

He writes a chapter at a time from a different city and mails it out to the heads of all the big spy agencies in: London, Paris, Rome, Moscow, Peking, Bonn and of course, DC. He tells the truth about various operations and all the agencies are looking to stop him. He eludes them using his wit and succeeds to exact sweet revenge on Myerson (Beatty's character) by relying on the FBI to overreact. He doesn't carry a gun and commits no acts of violence.

It was really enjoyable watching Kendig staying one step ahead of the CIA and KGB, making fools of all of them. The staging of his demise was perfect.

No one wants that, the CIA...the Russians...so...it's a free for all to see who can permanently ""retire"" him once and for all. A jolly romp with lots of laughs.

312042,5,6301050886,"I have seen this movie dozens of times.  One of my favorites.

Walter Matthau was a fabulous actor.  He could do it all -- from Mr. Wilson in Dennis the Menace to the Little League Coach in Bad News Bears to the completely amoral and despicable bad guy in Charley Varrick.

Glenda Jackson and Matthau only made two films together, this one, and House Calls -- both good films, this one being the better of the two.  They play off each other really well in this film.  Sam Waterston is good as Matthau's protege at the CIA.  Ned Beatty, another fine character actor, is great as the politically connected assistant CIA director who has gone beyond the Peter Principle in his job.  When Beatty orders Watterson's character to ""cancel his ticket"" -- kill Matthau -- it is completely believable.

One of the funniest scenes in the film is when Matthau is hiding out in a plantation house and the FBI shows up to root him out.  Keep an eye on the photo of Ned Beatty next to Matthau's typewriter as the scene unfolds.  The expression on Beatty's face keeps changing -- one of the brilliant little gems in the film which can easily be missed if one is not paying attention.

This film is also a family affair.  David Matthau (Walter's son) plays one of the FBI agents, and his daughter-in-law plays a pilot of a small airplane.

Matthau came up with the idea of using opera music -- and chose the music himself -- as he was a big fan of opera.

This Critereon DVD is very good quality, very watchable.  Don't miss this one.",1431388800,6,1517,4.442028985507246

Watler Matthau plays the agent to perfection, using a clever mix of charisma and sincerity to elevate his performance. The script is very good, with crackling dialogue between Matthau and his fellow spies, including his love interest, Glenda Jackson.

Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are in peak form as the main characters, and the supporting cast is equally strong.  Ned Beatty plays an ultra-jerk, a character he has perfected; and a young Sam Waterston shows the promise as an actor that he has since fulfilled.

Other reviews will give you more of a synopsis of the plot.  I just wanted to add my vote to all of those who have given this funny, sophisticated, clever movie the four or five stars it deserves.  A favorite scene that always gives me a laugh:  Walter Matthau in a phone booth (what's that, Mommy?) speaking in falsetto as Eleanor Roosevelt.",1393372800,5,786,4.492957746478873

I first saw this back in the early 80's, and I fell in love with it. I attribute my love of classical music, Mozart specifically, to this movie.

Walter Matthau  is Miles Kendig, and over-aged CIA field operative that decides to go off the reservation and write his memoirs.
Ned Beatty was his boss, and REALLY does not want a rouge CIA agent giving away top secert matierial by publishing it for all the world to read.

there are car chases, gun fights, fire works, and a finale featuring a helicopter trying to shoot down a Bi-plane!
every other line in the movie is worth remembering, AND you get to see Sam Waterson when he was still young!

With the able assistance of his unflappable lady love, Jackson, Matthau outwits Beatty at every turn, always to the delight and amusement of the movie audience.

312879,4,6301050886,"Hopscotch (Ronald Neame, 1980)

What happens when the CIA decides to put a longtime, successful, high-powered spy out to pasture because he's getting old? That's a question that's been dealt with many times (usually in Robert Ludlum-esque cold war thrillers), but never so amusingly as in Ronald Neame's 1980 film Hopscotch which, in the age of Valerie Plame and the media dimwits who outed her, is--as is more and more often the case with political flicks we found absurd-yet-compelling in the seventies (viz. The Conversation)--even more relevant today than it was thirty-two years ago.

Miles Kendig (The Bad News Bears' Walter Matthau) has flipped from the ""asset"" side of the balance sheet to the ""liability"" side, as far as his boss, Myerson (Deliverance's Ned Beatty) is concerned. And for Miles, the feeling's mutual--he's fed up with the incompetence of Myerson and his new flunkie, Cutter (Law and Order's Sam Waterston). In order to show them just how incompetent they are, he issues them a challenge: prevent him from writing a tell-all memoir that will expose reams of highly classified information, not to mention how horribly it's handled by the CIA, the KGB, etc. And thus begins Miles' last great spy game.

Perhaps the movie's most surprising note is that the romance subplot (and I use the term ""romance"" loosely here; Matthau and Glenda Jackson behave more like an old married couple) doesn't feel in any way forced in a movie that really has no place for a romance subplot. Neame and Brian Garfield (Death Wish), adapting his own novel, take enough of a slice-of-life approach in between the car chases and stuff blowing up that it works. (Imagine a romance subplot in, say, Ronin and you'll see just how ludicrous the idea is.) And that's a great example of what a surprise this movie is decades later; with the cold war long over and most of the countries mentioned in the film as enemies now considered our allies, this should feel as dated as a Bell Telephone commercial, and yet it still pops. Ronald Neame, who died in 2010 at the ripe old age of 99, was nominated for three Oscars in his career, all in the forties--twice for writing (both times for David Lean films) and once for special effects. Hopscotch is a very good case that some of Neame's directorial work should perhaps have been more closely scrutinized by the Academy. *** ",1352332800,,2364,4.844059405940594

312956,4,6301050886,"Hopscotch is a funny, clever and relaxingly entertaining spy film.  It manages to combine intelligence with a sweet good humor that is unusual in this genre.  Most of the time one is either biting one's nails engrossed in the taut suspense of a thriller or laughing in an embarrassed manner over the antics in a slapstick spy comedy.  This film breaks such stereotypes in its witty story of rogue CIA agent Miles Kendig, played expertly by Walter Matthau, out to get revenge on his cruel and crude CIA superior Myerson (Ned Beatty).  The story of how Kendig outwits his CIA boss is compelling not primarily in its suspense but in its creativity and good humor.  Yet the humor is more thoughtful and imaginative than the norm.  It is significant that as an active agent in the field Kendig has not carried a weapon for years, and uses trickery, not force, on his enemies.  In the same vein, weapons and firepower in the film are kept to a minimum; characteristically, no one is killed.

The film does include a heavy shot of vulgar and profane language, primarily from the villain Myerson, so anyone wishing to avoid such a verbal blast for themselves and their children, be forewarned.  The romantic relationship between Kendig (Matthau) and a retired agent played by Glenda Jackson is a bit forced, unnecessary, and coarse.

It's a good Matthau performance because he wasn't completely grumpy back in 1980 but he playe a terrible script.

The lesson we and our kids should learn from this movie is this: do seek to work for the government as a spook but, if your boss is not nice and kind to you then expose all the bad spook work. Not because it's wrong - after all, you'd been doing it - but because your boss was not kind to you.

I like everything that this accomplished actor did and he did it all.  I'm partial to the big clumsy, independent, cantankerous but lovable characters in his later films.  Despite the rumpled and ordinary looks he presented, there was always a certain self assured polish and charm that showed through.

Hopscotch is a riot as he continually shows his heels to another old character actor Ned Beatty.  With Glenda Jackson as his romantic partner in crime, he is a delight to watch wreaking revenge on his pinheaded bureaucratic boss(Beatty), who arbitrarily removed Walter from active work at the CIA, thus effectively ending his career.  Getting the dimwit to call in SWAT firepower on his own house, while Walter hightails it out the back is just hilarious. I even ended up humming opera after the movie!!

313005,2,6301050886,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  You'll probably love 'Hopscotch' if you love Walter Matthau. It's really a one man show with the supporting cast playing second fiddle all the way to the late, great thespian. The film dates back to 1980 during the height of the Cold War. Matthau plays Miles Kendig, a veteran CIA agent who takes down a Soviet spy ring but declines to eliminate the leader of the operation, his KGB nemesis, Yaskov. Kendig has been friends with Yaskov for years and when his new boss at CIA headquarters, Myerson (played by an unpleasant Ned Beatty who continually employs the ""F"" word throughout the movie), is angered by Kendig's refusal to eliminate Yaskov, he transfers the veteran operative to the file room.

  Kendig then destroys his own file and takes off without telling anyone at the CIA where he is off to. He then meets with Yaskov who offers him a job as a double agent but Kendig apologetically declines. Yaskov then asks Kendig what he'll do with the rest of his life and when Kendig replies that he's uncertain, Yaskov suggests that he write his memoirs. This is the impetus for the second act of 'Hopscotch' in which Kendig decides to take his revenge on his former employer by sending the first chapter of his memoirs to various spy agencies around the world including the CIA. The memoirs chronicle a long history of CIA 'dirty tricks' in which Myerson had a big hand. Myerson is bent on eliminating Kendig in order to prevent the big expose.

  The rest of Hopscotch involves a cat and mouse game where Myerson, along with the operative who replaced Kendig, Cutter (ably played by a young Sam Waterson), attempt to discover Kendig's whereabouts before he finishes his manuscript and has it published. Kendig ends up globe trotting including a trip to Myerson's house in Georgia where he places firecrackers inside the living room and then phones the CIA from Myerson's home phone. The FBI joins the CIA and they end up shooting up the house as the firecrackers go off. Kendig escapes by taking one of Myerson's bumbling operatives hostage, driving off in a small truck (since this is supposed to be a comedy, no one ever tries to jump Kendig while he brandishes a gun, knowing full well that he would never shoot anyone!).

  Nothing much else happens until the climax when Kendig rigs an old bi-plane to fly via remote control. As Myerson chases the bi-plane in a helicopter, Kendig pushes a button and the plane explodes, leading the CIA to believe that Kendig is no more (it's not clear how Kendig makes it look like he never got into the plane). With the CIA no longer chasing him, Kendig's memoirs becomes a best-seller and he walks off into the sunset with his old flame, Isobel, played by the now retired Glenda Jackson.

  We first meet Isobel at the beginning of the film where Kendig rekindles his old relationship with her in Austria. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two actors fizzles, since they are never seen face to face until the end of the movie (they communicate constantly via telephone). The same goes for all the other principals (including Beatty and Waterston) who have virtually no screen time face to face with Matthau (there's a rather flat scene where Kendig ties Cutter up in a hotel room).

  If you're looking for many twists and turns, you will not find it here in 'Hopscotch'. The whole thing is a rather pedestrian affair, adapted from a popular novel whose screenplay did not translate very well into the intended visual tour de force. Hopscotch is also supposed to be witty and amusing but is undercut by the one-note, nasty image of the CIA, represented by the aforementioned unpleasant Myerson, bent on taking down a rogue agent at any cost. The CIA's attempt to eliminate Kendig (instead of capturing him), ruins the otherwise whimsical tone of the film's narrative. On the other hand, Waterson's 'Cutter' and Herbert Lom's 'Yaskov' are too warm-hearted to have much effect on the proceedings, as the story simply plods along.

  My late father, a big classical music aficionado, was a big fan of this movie and with a plethora of all that Mozart constituting the film's soundtrack, I can understand why. Despite the endearing musical score, Hopscotch's plot is a big dud as its protagonist's machinations do not prove to be very clever. If you're willing to give Hopscotch a 'pass' based on your love for Walter Matthau (as Roger Ebert did in his 1980 review), then you might deceive yourself into believing this is a well-written movie. It's not and in reality it's a rather dull and boring affair!",1270252800,6,4597,4.76448362720403

313059,4,6301050886,"Another Cold War espionage thriller but this one's got a sense of humor. HOPSCOTCH is fueled predominantly by Walter Matthau's performance. Glenda Jackson, then fresh off her pairing with Matthau from the wonderful HOUSE CALLS, steps in for a bit, but she doesn't get at all a lot of screen time. The few scenes Matthau and Jackson get to do together, you can see how well they play off each other. But, yes, this is predominantly a Walter Matthau vehicle. Without him, HOPSCOTCH falls flat on its face. Because the story? Feh.

Decades spent with the CIA as a veteran field operative, and Miles Kendig's independent streak finally gets him disciplined. But Kendig isn't about to take his demotion to desk jockey duty lying down. He erases his personal file and walks out on the agency... and then he starts writing his tell-all memoirs. This instantly targets him for elimination by the CIA. But, first, they have to catch him.

There's a sense of repetitiveness in the film. It boils down to Kendig first taunting and toying with his fellow spooks, then the pursuit, then the getaway. Rinse and repeat. It's one big running ""Eff you"" from Kendig to his overbearing ex-boss Myerson. And, without Matthau's steady presence and rumpled, sad-dog-faced charm, it would all have become pretty tiresome really quickly. Partly it's because the movie presents a series of lightweight cat & mouse games rather than the atmospheric skullduggery which pans out in heavy casualties. HOPSCOTCH lacks explosive action-packed encounters, and in fact no one buys the farm in this one. The tone is more amiable, never mind that Ned Beatty cusses up a storm as Kendig's primary and perpetually provoked antagonist Myerson. Beatty is very good, by the way, as is a young Sam Waterston who fleshes out Kendig's protg. Not really at the level of and tonally different from taut spy classics like THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and MARATHON MAN, HOPSCOTCH offers a less frenzied, more lighthearted look at the world of spooks and skullduggery. But really how many times can we roll with the protagonist tricking the CIA, FBI, and KGB silly thru the cunning subterfuge of assorted passports and messages left on a tape recorder? Walter Matthau makes it work.

The locations are a plus; it's a globe-trotting adventure, after all. We get to see Walter Matthau do his thing while framed in breathtaking locales in Salzburg, Bermuda, Munich, and London and Savannah. Referencing the film's tongue-in-cheeked flavor, note also the subtle touch in which the expression on a framed photo of Myerson keeps changing each time the camera falls on it, gradually going from smiley-faced to morose. Give it a look when you get a chance.

From the Criterion Collection, this DVD has the following bonus features: informative interviews with director Ronald Neame and writer Brian Garfield (who wrote the titular best-seller novel); an optional broadcast television audio track for those with more delicate ears; the original theatrical trailer and the teaser. The featurette with Neame and Garfield is really worth checking out, by the way, as both cats have some interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits to tell. One of the fun facts we learn is that Walter Matthau loved listening to Mozart, this leading to his film character also being an avid Mozart fan. The calming strains of Mozart certainly lend a distinctive touch to this cloak & dagger caper. Not to mention, Matthau's singing along gruffly to ""Largo al factotum"" (the Figaro song) from The Barber of Seville. Walter Matthau a cultured snob?

Although it received mixed reviews when it came out in 1980, Hopscotch still remains popular and is driven by a more than average, clever plot. Glenda Jackson has good chemistry with Walter, even though there's an age difference to deal with. And there's a surprisingly good deal of Mozart and Rossini sprinkled throughout the sound track, mainly because Matthau loved these composers. Matthau's character, who's writing an expose (his memoirs) of the CIA, needs writing music and inevitably puts on a record of a Mozart opera (The Marriage of Figaro). This was Matthau's own idea. He seemed to have brought much to this movie. For instance, he dreamed up the sequence where he becomes reacquainted with Glenda Jackson via a conversation with her about wines. That scene works very nicely. You won't waste your time watching this one. I recommend it as a good brief escape from our mad world.

313422,5,6301050886,"Building on their chemistry in 1978's HOUSE CALLS, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson again were paired in HOPSCOTCH (1980), a melodious and gentle interpretation of Brian Garfield's novel of the same name (as is the basic story line, but with heart and humor; none of the novel characters were anywhere near as appealing).

It's that rarity in movies for the '80's: a truly intelligent but unassuming action comedy, strong on character and language and carrying little in the way of real violence. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one contemporary movie in much the same vein.

Garfield was the primary screenwriter, but it was Matthau who was a major influence in the story, down to suggesting music for the soundtrack (which was sadly never produced, though it could probably be reconstructed) and the casting. Ned Beatty is properly crude, Sam Waterson bemused, and  Glenda Jackson her feisty self. But it is clearly Matthau's film -- mugging, hamming and thumbing his nose at authority. The movie is peppered with jokes about age, politics and relationships, and while it may not generate belly laughs, it sneaks up and grabs you, and doesn't let go.

Critics faulted the movie for Beatty's liberal use of the ""F"" word (well, it was 1980!), and this DVD edition offers two versions: the original as shown in theaters, and a sanitized version for television or for those faint of heart.

That being said, I prefer the original -- without the profanity, Beatty's character would have seemed toothless at times, and it was precisely his earnest crudeness that weighed so heavily in contrasting him with Matthau's urbane character.

I hope no one tries a ""remake"" of this gem. It wouldn't be anywhere near as much fun if it were produced today. In an era where toilet jokes pass as comedy and where ""heroes"" have to either be obnoxious or neurotic, this caliber of writing and acting would simply sail over most people's heads.

No, it's not ""grand cinema,"" but it takes you on a warm and honest little romp that leaves you cheering and laughing all the way. If you're looking for intelligence in your humor and real professional actors at the top of their game, get this one!",1117152000,10,2166,4.822102425876011

I sometimes think, if I had access to the outtakes of this movie, I could very easily put together something along the lines of Sealab 2021...only, it's not animated...anyway...

Walter Mathau plays a bumbling, yet clever spy turned ex-spy who's outrunning agents from both sides of the Iron Curtain while writing the ultimate spygame expose.

With a tagline like that, you'd expect something a little bit more--but the movie seems to just fall flat in all respects. It never quite gets a sense of pacing and relies a bit too much on curious sight and scene gags.

Walter Mathau is never disappointing--except, perhaps when he's called upon to be slightly dramatic in a non-sardonic way. Glenda Jackson is also delightful as a ticklishly dry companion. Works as a perfect pairing to Mathau's warmly dry doberman type humor.",1096848000,5,979,5.138364779874214
313497,5,6301050886,"Off the top of your head, how many funny spy films can you think of?  The James Colburn `Flint' films of the 60's?  The Austin Powers movies perhaps?  Or that incredibly lame Leslie Nielsen film...Spy Hard (1996)?  Over-the-top silliness seems to be a common theme in these films, but Hopscotch (1980), based on a book written by Brian Garfield, also a comedy involving spies, manages to rise above, avoiding the slapsticky and crude humor, rather providing a charming and intelligent story that entertains throughout.  Directed by Ronald Neame (Prudence and the Pill, The Poseidon Adventure, The Odessa File), the film stars a wonderful and accomplished cast of actors including Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Sam Waterston, Herbert Lom, and Ned Beatty.
Matthau plays Miles Kendig, one of the CIA's top field agents who suddenly finds himself relegated to a desk job after control of the department he works for is taken over by a petty, vindictive, and less than capable man named Myerson (Beatty) who seems to harbor a personal grudge against Kendig.  Unable to deal with riding his career out behind a desk, Kendig leaves the agency, and, after much thought, decides to write his memoirs, detailing all kinds of juicy, sensitive stuff about not only his own agency, but also intelligence agencies throughout the world.  After being in the biz for thirty years, he certainly has the inside scoop on all kinds of things, causing his former boss to put out the order for his termination, elimination, liquidation, extermination, what have you...with the aid of a wealthy widow and love interest named Isobel who was also once in the game, played by Jackson, Kendig begins leading his former colleagues on a chase that spans halfway around the globe, always managing to stay one or two steps ahead.  Will he be able to finish his book before his old agency or that of a foreign power catches up to him?  Even if he does, will he live to see his work published?
Hopscotch is a wonderfully witty, light comedy with a dash of sophistication that nearly everyone can enjoy.  Matthau plays his role so perfectly that after seeing the film, you could imagine no one else in the part.  He's certainly got that whole irascible charm thing down, and it fits with the character very well here.  I loved how his character never seemed to lose his calm composure, constantly outwitting and outsmarting his former co-workers in leisure like fashion, given that he probably wrote the book and trained half the men now chasing him.  The element of Kendig using the notion of a book for revenge at first, but then once removed from the work he participated in for so long and seeing just how nasty it is from an outside perspective decides to follow through with his initial threat of finishing the book and getting it published.  Jackson plays so very well off Matthau, and they create a level of chemistry that's pretty rare, in my opinion, between on screen couples.  They just seem to fit so naturally together, creating a level of believability to counteract the somewhat unrealistic element that the CIA are a mostly a bunch of bumbling buffoons.  Did anyone else think her hair was a bit too short, giving her the appearance of a young boy?  Maybe it was just me...  I really enjoyed a young looking Waterston (Law and Order) as Cutter, Kendig's competent and intelligent protg now responsible for finding and eliminating his former mentor.  I read that he'd actually come into shooting late due to the film he was working on prior, Heaven's Gate (1980) ran past its' shooting schedule, and is the reason why Waterston looks so very tired in some of the scenes in Hopscotch.  Herbert Lom is also very good as a Soviet agent named Yaskov, one ""who's seen Casablanca one too many times"", although I felt he deserved a bit more screen time.  Ned (Squeal like a pig for me, boy) Beatty is a riot as Myerson, constantly exasperated by his group's futile attempts to put a lid on the loose cannon he himself let loose due to his own petty dislikes for Kendig.  Imagine someone you work with that no one likes, and then that person finally getting a little bit of power, lording over certain individuals, power tripping here and there, but mostly tripping over his own feet, and you basically have Myerson.  The direction by Neame was most excellent, keeping the viewer (me) engaged throughout, with a smooth, steady pace as the story unfolded, which is a bit light in some parts, but did nothing to reduce my enjoyment of this charming, funny film.
Criterion provides a superior high-definition digital transfer here in wide screen format and a cleaned up soundtrack.  The quality of the picture is really fabulous, especially when compared to my old VHS copy.  As far as special features are concerned, there's not as much as I would have thought from a Criterion release, but what's here is very worthy.  There's liner notes on the insert inside the DVD case by Bruce Eder, a video introduction by writer Brian Garfield and director Roland Neame along with interviews, a separate audio track, a clean version created for television broadcast along with the original version (there's very little profanity in the film, but what this is comes from Ned Beatty's character Myerson) and an original theatrical trailer along with a teaser trailer for the film.  If you're looking for a smartly funny engaging comedy that only gets better after repeated viewings, then Hopscotch is for you.

Throw in Ned Beatty, Herbert Lom, and a very young Sam Waterston, and you have a real winner. Hopscotch is one of those movies that we just watch over and over again. Having gone through two or three copies of the tape, we're now getting the DVD.
This is one of those movies that runs on pure wit. One of our favorite scenes is Matthau's engineering the destruction of the CIA director's country house -- by the CIA, and accompanied by the score of Madama Butterfly. As for the cast, Jackson is a perfect droll foil for Matthau's wild irreverence as he undertakes writing his memoirs -- a disclosure of CIA operations during his career as station head in Europe -- and then proceeds to release them, a chapter at a time, to all the major powers. Suddenly, everyone wants the memoirs -- and Matthau -- suppressed, with extreme prejudice. And the chase is on.
If you're looking for fast action, gun battles, car chases, and Matrix-style special effects, look elsewhere. But if you want a smart, talky, brilliantly plotted and performed romantic thriller-comedy, Hopscotch is a sure bet.

313502,3,6301050886,"HOPSCOTCH (Criterion) from 1980 is a light-weight, cynical but entertaining take on Cold War shenanigans. Walter Matthau is at the top of his form as Miles Kendig, a sardonic CIA agent who, suddenly relegated to a desk job in an agency power play, announces plans to get even by publishing a tell-all book. Ned Beatty is Matthau's arrogant, crude, boss who is increasingly desperate to off Matthau before the book gets out. (By a fluke, there was just such a book that made big news after this film went into production!)
Sunny, globe trotting locations from Atlanta to Berlin to Vienna and laid back direction from Ronald Neame are a big plus, but what makes this a worthy consideration for your digital library is the classy chemistry between Matthau and Glenda Jackson, who plays Matthau's Viennese lover. Remember their near-perfect pairing in 1978's House Calls? It's as good if not better here. The widescreen transfer is super crisp and there's a fun interview with Neame and author Brian Garfield.",1050537600,12,1005,4.952662721893491

This movie made me smile a few times but that's about all.  Everything is too predictable and the many of the characters are so clichd and cartoonish that they aren't believable.  I never felt drawn in and there wasn't any real tension to make the comedy work.
The alternate sound track that takes out the occasional swear word and the lack of violence or sex makes it a light movie that a family with small children could enjoy.  Small children won't be bothered by the major plot flaws at the end.
I'm not sorry I saw it, but there's no reason to watch it again.  If you want to see how good Walter Matthau can be in a movie of this type, get ""Charlie Varrick"".

313612,5,6301050886,"We saw this movie back in the early 1980's and loved it, but by the time we tried to get a copy, it had gone out of print.  Many thanks to Criterion for releasing it on DVD!  This film is superb, well-written and directed, with a cast of very gifted performers.  The actors play their roles to the hilt and have a terrific chemistry onscreen.
The plot is basic revenge, perpetrated on the CIA by one of its top operatives.  Walter Matthau plays the amiable Kendig, a man who's served in the field for decades and is an excellent agent.  He's smart yet still down-to-earth; his reputation among the underworld of spydom is the stuff of legends.  Kendig is respected even by his enemies for his savvy decisions and sense of fair play, and his reluctance to resort to dirty tricks.  His new boss, Meyerson (Ned Beatty) resents his underling's popularity and decides to neutralize Kendig's effectiveness by yanking him from the field and assigning him to a desk job as a file clerk.
To say that Kendig despises his new boss would be a gross understatement.  A switched file is shredded and Kendig vanishes, fleeing to Austria and his lover Isobel (Glenda Jackson).  From there, he nurses his wounds and launches on his vengeance against Meyerson and the CIA by writing a book that reveals the agency's dirty tricks and botched missions.  Meyerson is livid and assigns Joe Cutter (Sam Waterston) to put a stop to Kendig by any means necessary, especially assassination.  Cutter admires Kendig and is torn by his personal feelings for the man and his desire to serve his country.
The story then twists and turns as Kendig leads his former employers on a huge wild goose chase.  He calls them from a phone booth right near the CIA headquarters, hides out in Meyerson's southern house---which is later demolished by the feds themselves---, and feeds chapters of the book to Meyerson to whip him into a frenzy of ineffectual rage.  He plans on getting the entire book to a publisher, and his means for doing so and ensuring his own protection from future assassination attempts are ingenious.
We are very happy that this movie was released to the public once again.  Matthau is superb as a real man working in an unreal world of espionage.  Herbert Lom is great for the role of his KGB counterpart, and Glenda Jackson is both tart and elegant as the enigmatic Isobel, who frankly adores Kendig.  Ned Beatty plays the part of the oafish Meyerson to perfection, making the viewer hate him thoroughly.  Waterston is in excellent form as the good-hearted and conflicted Cutter, and shows hints of his mildly acerbic wit that would come to fruition in his later role of McCoy.  The supporting players are fine, too, and the plot is well-crafted and believable.
The DVD is nicely done.  There aren't many extras, but it's beautifully produced and does have a nice feature:  an alternate soundtrack that deletes the foul language, so even kids can watch it with their parents.  We are pleased with our investment, and highly recommend ""Hopscotch"" to anyone who enjoys a well-done and stylish comedy.  It's also perfect for fans of Walter Matthau!",1036368000,79,3130,4.768089053803339
313613,5,6301050886,One of Matthau's best films as he plays a retiring CIA operative who runs circles around his new clueless boss (Ned Beatty) and former colleaguess (including a young and admiring Sam Waterson). Shot all over Europe and includes a wonderful portrayal by Glenda Jackson as his girlfriend who lends her assistance. Very witty script with Mozart music and also incredibly clever and intricate plot which is completely satisfying in every way.

313614,5,6301050886,"I can't improve on most of the other reviews here, as I too think Hopscotch is an under-rated gem, and I've probably watched it at least 20 times. Matthau is marvelous as usual, Beatty is perfect as the CIA honcho, and Sam Waterston is richly understated as the good-guy go-between between the characters of Beatty and Matthau.
HOWEVER, some people who loved this movie may find it nice to know that the piano and orchestra music that underscores much of the movie is the Rondo from Mozart's Piano Concerto #20 in D, K382. There are several dozen versions of it on CD here and there, varying from Brendel's ponderous and slow reading to Annie Fischer's and Murray Perehia's more spirited ones. After hearing the snappy version during the movie, anything slow seems  far out of character for the piece.
I always knew it was Mozart, but couldn't for the life of me place it until recently. So there you have it. Since there is no ""soundtrack"" album, per se, enterprising music lovers with a CD burner can make their own, betwen the Rondo, Barber of Seville, and Un Bel Di..",1035590400,5,1071,4.636842105263158

The resulting chases, shootouts, and stupid impressions will leave you rolling in the aisles.
What he has done to his boss's Southern retirement home is the stuff dreams are made of.  If you've ever had an idiot for a boss and wanted revenge, you'll be rooting for Miles Kendig (Matthau) all the way.

  another steller performance is played by glenda jackson who has worked with mr. matthau in a few other pictures and plays his love interest in this movie.the chemistry between these two is wonderful and i don't believe there is another actor around that  could have brought off this part as well as she does.
  all the acting in this movie is wonderful and the chemistry between the actors is outstanding. it's a great script and i think persons of my age can identify with the character played by mr. matthay if your getting older and sometimes wonder if you job and everyone around you somedays seem to be trying to retire you early(just alittle healthy paranoia everyone).

313816,5,6301050886,"""Hopscotch"" is one of my favorite movies. Based on a novel by Brian Garfield (who also worked on the screenplay), it's a perfect vehicle for Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson; I consider it to be Matthau's best performance.
Although the plot is totally implausible, it carries the viewer along. I think this is largely because the real world of ""intelligence"" is sometimes equally implausible; everyone who has had even an indirect connection with the intelligence community can relate true stories just as wacky as the episodes in this movie. Almost all of the movie is pure invention, but Garfield must have known something about the CIA; in particular, one of the characters is an extremely unflattering takeoff on Richard Bissell, including a reference to one of Bissell's worst ideas.
Unfortunately, a copy of this video is hard to find for sale. But many video rental stores have a copy for rent.

7809536,5,6301050886,"Ive seen this movie many times over the past 35 years or so (starting a tradition with my parents when I was in high school). Its also a favorite to share with others whove never heard of it but who I know appreciate lesser-known great movies and laughs. I just introduced my 27 y.o. niece and her friend to it. They loved it and added it to their list of favorite movies ever.

Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Herbert Lom and a young Sam Waterston are perfect in their roles, as is Ned Beatty in the role of the jerky, blustering, CIA station boss, Meyerson. Though other lead actors were considered, I cannot imagine another cast, and it feels like there was attention to so many details and to casting choice for every small and supporting scene making the whole film really come together.

With sincere respect for our intelligence community, there's still a timeless relevance to some aspects of this film, and it's great fun to follow Miles Kendig (Matthau) while he keeps one step ahead of the CIA and the Soviets, with the help of old connections and training, a penchant for speaking in terrible accents but a talent for whistling... and accompanied by Mozart and Italian Opera. ;)  Kendig is endearing, as are those who care about him. The pacing and musical score are perfect. The dialogue is witty (much of it written specifically to accommodate Matthau's dry style but some of it ad-libbed by him anyway, apparently). Perhaps Im just a sentimentalist, but the late 70s/early 80s production values and styles and such only add to the charm of this film for me. A couple of things that if you're like me you might wish to know... The R-rating, which likely wouldn't be given to it today, is due to some foul language (predominantly from Beatty's character) and not due to lots of profanity throughout the movie or any violence, nudity or sex. One other note (and I don't think this is a spoiler): There's something important revealed in a brief moment in Sam Waterston's facial expression right towards the end that in some formats or when it comes on t.v. hasn't been visible (maybe pan and scan cutting it off or something?). That's a bummer and hopefully has been corrected on currently offered formats. I can only say that, happily, it is visible on this Amazon streaming version.

Ned Beatty is excellent as the jerk bureaucrat, and Sam Waterston is superb as the agent on the chase for Matthau. But my favorite supporting character might be Herbert Lom as the Soviet spy chief. My favorite line of his, discussing the Matthau character: ""I do like him, you know. One can't help it.""

7809540,4,6301050886,"Hopscotch: Hopscotch is a pleasant adult comedy about a CIA field agent (Walter Matthew) forced behind a desk by new boss (Ned Beatty) and having his young protege (Sam Waterston) take his place. He leaves the CIA instead.

He hides out with an old flame (Glenda Jackson)recently widowed and rich while pursued to turn sides by his old adversary an amiable KGB officer (Herbert Lom)

The Good: Amiable is a good word for this entire film. Walter Matthew does nothing to surprise keeping in his pleasant but rascally grandpa mode he would use to such great effect a few years later in Grumpy Old Men. Despite the globe-trotting, the occasional gunfire and explosion there really is never a sense of threat to anyone. Atomic Blonde this is not.

As for the rest of the cast. Sam Waterston gives a surprisingly pleasant performance as the protege, Ned Beatty seems to channel Jackie Gleason in Smokey and the Bandit (with even less menace) and Herbert Lom is the kindest most relaxed KGB bureau chief you will ever see.

The Bad: Glenda Jackson (who is fine by the way) plays an ex-agent who got out when the CIA started getting too rough. Its that old it wasn't like this in the old days chestnut. The only problem with this theme is that anyone with a cursory knowledge of the CIA certainly would know it was much rougher and no holds barred in the sixties and early seventies than it was under Carter after the Church Committee hearings. Too much paperwork or you're not allowed to torture anymore would be a more accurate complaint but alas would not fit into the theme of the film.

In Conclusion: If you like Walter Matthew you will like this film. It really is grumpy old spies. It clearly dropped some f bombs in the script so it could get an R rating in the US and market itself to an older crowd. There is nothing here in reality that would offend grandma or the grandkids. One trivial aside, there is a scene in a Hilton in London where they use key cards to get into their hotel room. I had no idea hotels had that in the late seventies.
