2244302,3,B0007U7XTE,"""Union Station"" is a post-War thriller revolving around a kidnapping plot, unique for the amount of time it spends in Chicago's Union Station. Joyce Willecombe (Nancy Olson), observes two men enter her train car in a hurry, one of them in possession of a gun. She reports the suspicious behavior to Lt. Bill Calhoun (William Holden), the police officer assigned to the train station in Chicago. It later becomes clear that the men whom Joyce observed have kidnapped the blind daughter of Joyce's employer, Mr. Murchison (Herbert Hayes), and are holding her for ransom. Joyce assists in identifying the men, and Lt. Calhoun and his superior Inspector Donnelly (Barry Fitzgerald) pursue the suspects in slim hopes of getting Lorna Murchison (Allene Roberts) back alive.

The plot doesn't make much sense. The opening sequence of Joyce on the train contributes little to the story except to maneuver Joyce into it. I suppose that Joyce is supposed to be the person the audience identifies with -down to earth, an average citizen with a strong sense of justice-  but she just seems extraneous. The police assume that the kidnap victim is dead for no apparent reason. And they're not much better than thugs when they have a suspect in their hands. There is another superfluous sequence when Calhoun pursues a suspect on a street car. It seems that the writers wanted to include certain elements of suspense, romance, action, and Irish cops in the film, and pieced them together whatever way they could, sense notwithstanding.

The mastermind of the kidnapping scheme is a cruel ex-con named Joe Beacom (Lyle Bettger). My interest picked up halfway through the film, when Joe got more screen time. Beacom and his platinum blond moll seem more interesting than their pursuers, but we see too little of them. Joe remarks that he can't understand why anyone would pay to have Lorna back; I was wondering the same thing. She's a squealy, hysterical young woman who inspires no sympathy. The quasi-heroine, Joyce, is equally unappealing, partly because she doesn't do anything, but also because she is rather homely. I kept thinking that it would be great to see William Holden and Lyle Bettger face off in a better movie. The print on the Olive Films 2010 DVD is a little grainy but has no major flaws and good sound.",1281484800,2,2307,4.910256410256411
2244303,3,B0007U7XTE,"The film's story line - the kidnapping of a blind girl with the kidnappers using the huge Chicago Union Railroad Station as the contact point for the distraught father and dropoff for the ransom. William Holden is the ""boss cop"" {Lt ""Willie Calhoun} of the station who working with  Barry Fitzgerald {Inspector Donnelly} are going to use their knowledge of the layout of the Station to trap the kidnappers when they try to pick up the $100,000 ransom.

Nancy Olson {Joyce Willcombe} knows the victim, works for her father and by a very convienent almost improbable plot twist has put the police on-to the kidnapping even before the initial ransom note is even delivered to the father.

There are some good episolds in the movie, the tracking and pursuit of one of the kidnappers on the Chicago elevated, the murder of a police officer by the boss kidnapper Lyle Bettger {Joe Beacom} who leaves his wounded mistress Jan Sterling {Marge Wrighter} pleading in the gutter as he speeds away and best of all - the casual brutality, slaps, kicks, punches and death threats used by Calhoun and Donnelly and their squad playing ""good cop/bad cop"" to ""extract"" information from an underling in the depths of Union Station that in 2014 would consitute a 5 to 10 million dollar lawsuit and cost a few police their jobs besides. Of course the underling spills his guts and probaly wet his pants in this circa 1950 routine police interrogation. How times have changed!!

The best performances are by Lyle Bettger who is excellent as the boss kidnapper cold stare, steely voice and mocking the blind girl as he slaps her around when she wimpers too much and by Jan Sterling as a trashy floozy who has some sympathy for the victim but luvs Beacom while he treats her like dirt. Nancy Olson playing to type as a wide eyed innocent with ""Backbone"" gives her role some depth and is pretty good.

HOWEVER, Barry Fitzgerald reprising his 1948 role from ""The Naked City"" is too cute/coy as the loveable shrewd Irish "" Full of Blarney"" Inspector. Allene Roberts as the kidnap victim {Lorna Murchison} is an unsympathetic and whiney victim. Rudolph Mate was a great cameraman but his direction of the movie is pedestrian and the final chase thru the station's underground service tunnels is ok but could have been much better - it's to slowly paced and doesn't have enough tension and falls kind of flat.

BUT the film's most serious flaw is the miscasting of William Holden as the hardbitten cop - his performance lacks the hard edge and he's not cynical or tough enough to pull it off. A far better choice for this role would have been Paramount's other male ""biggie"" - Alan Ladd whose tough guy image, dry voice and laconic manner would have played nicely against Nancy Olson's exasperated innocence. I guess after the successful teaming of Holden and Olson in ""Sunset Blvd"" Paramount rushed them into this picture to capitilize on that films runaway success. I wanted to like this movie much more than I did but its elements just didn't quite jell. Still, I give it a 3 1/2 star rating and would recommend its purchase.",1281052800,8,3099,4.729629629629629
2244304,4,B0007U7XTE,"Very good Film Noir film. Fast action and good suspense.

2244305,4,B0007U7XTE,"This is a little-known-but very good film noir. I sure wish it would come out on DVD with a good transfer.

William Holden and Nancy Olson both worked on Sunset Boulevard this same year this was released and here are together again. Actually, I like the two a lot better in this film. Yes, some of the scenes are a bit dumb but the story moves well and keeps your interest which is what a good crime story-drama should do.

I really enjoyed the train station, too. It looked awesome.",1244764800,,483,4.355555555555555
2244306,4,B0007U7XTE,"William Holden stars as Lt. William Calhoun who's in charge of the police force commissioned to patrol the busy Union Station.  Calhoun is alerted by a conductor that a female passenger Joyce Willecombe played by Nancy Olson has spotted two male passengers carrying guns.  The men had hurriedly embarked on the train and appeared suspicious to Olson.

Holden alerted his underlings to tail the two men, one of whom was Joe Beacom played by frequent cinema heavy Lyle Bettger.  They eventually stumble into a kidnapping plot.  Olson's boss a rich socialite named Henry Murchison played by distinguished looking silver haired Herbert Heyes had a young blind daughter Lorna played by Allene Roberts.  Young Lorna was the kidnap victim.

Holden and Police Inspector Donnelly played by the impish Irish born Barry Fitzgerald colloborate to attempt to thwart the well conceived scheme to bilk Mr. Murchison of $100,000.

The highlight of this rather standard film noir drama was the glorious black and white cinematography within the cavernous Union Station located in L.A..  The acting talents of Holden and Fitzgerald are hard to ignore but both shined more brightly in other more notable efforts.  Bettger also did well portraying the devious and calculating criminal mastermind.",1140134400,28,1276,5.272277227722772
2244307,5,B0007U7XTE,"What a treat! No computer graphics. People smoke cigarettes, drink whiskey, carry guns, speak politely and keep their clothes on.

2244308,2,B0007U7XTE,"You really have to like old movies a lot to give this one a good review.  Railroad police investigate the kidnapping of a wealthy blind girl.  Although Union Station looks handsome enough the script is completely ludicrous by modern standards, mainly because contemporary audiences will recognize all of the ridiculously stupid things the police do in the course of their investigation.  It seriously seems after a while like the police want the kidnappers to get wise to the fact that police are involved and to get the blind girl killed.

Actually, the police believe the girl is already dead, which accounts at least partially for the fact that they are so ridiculously heavy handed in their investigation.  Still, they couldn't possibly be more inept.  At one point early they put such an obvious tail on one of the kidnappers he would have to be blind to not figure out he is being followed.  At another point they grab one of the kidnappers in the train station rather than letting him lead them to where the girl is being kept.  Their brilliant plan?  Beat the crap out of the suspect until he gives up the hideout.

It's also rather ridiculous to believe that railroad police would be considered competent enough to investigate any aspect of a serious crime like a kidnapping.  They deal with pickpockets and scammers and the like but if someone was murdered on a train they would not be the ones to actually investigate that murder.  The whole movie just feels like it was made for an audience that knew nothing about how law enforcement actually worked--which might have been true back in 1950 when this was made because the production code that governed Hollywood movies forbade the realistic portrayal of crimes or their investigation since that might inspire people to actual criminal acts (seriously--that was part of the production code).  So Union Station does have an excuse for being so unrealistic--but that doesn't ultimately make it any better of a film.  The production code didn't apply to radio or television--so Dragnet (both the radio and TV versions) would soon be making the likes of Union Station completely obsolete.

If you love old movies and don't mind lapses in believability and logic then you might actually enjoy this crime film for the very reasons that make it so dated--it's a film from a more innocent time when people would apparently swallow anything.  I personally found Union Station to be dull and would rather watch pretty much any 1940's private eye movie, film noir or B crime flick instead.  Union Station was a movie that might have been impossible to make well at the time considering the restrictions imposed by the production code--so it would have been better to simply not make the movie at all.",1463961600,,2751,4.856531049250536

This black & white film truly is a view of the past... the setting of Union Station, the stereotypical ""cop"" and ""bad guys"", the fashions of the era, are all on display to offer the viewer an interesting escape that surrounds the kidnapping of a blind girl, a rich father who would truly like less police involvement, and even a short electric cart ride through the maintenance passages beneath the station... quite reminiscent of the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyworld without the threat of boulders.

2244377,5,B0007U7XTE,"This stars William Holden and Nancy Olsen. William Holden seemed to get these type of movies, sort of low budget. I guess because he lacked the charisma of a John Wayne or Gregory Peck. I think he was a great actor and in this movie the acting was very good. The story is somewhat simple and scenes, etc.. sort of monotonic. Compared to a movie like ""Guns of Navarone"" the movie fails considerably. Beside these details the acting is good and the romantic element between Holden and Olsen works well. I liked the movie and recommend to all.

2244387,4,B0007U7XTE,"As at least one other reviewer has commented, the real star of this film is Union Station itself -- the setting is supposed to be Chicago Union Station but actually Los Angeles Union Station was used in the filming. The place supplies atmosphere in excess and is shown off magnificently in the stark and well-composed black and white cinematography. The story is essentially a straight procedural drama centering around the kidnapping of a blind young woman. The prime bad guy is truly bad, and the police -- led by William Holden and Barry Fitzgerald -- are just as determined to catch him, with the safety of the girl an uncertain calculation in their minds. Meanwhile, a friend of the family, played by Nancy Olson, was the one who just by coincidence gave the cops enough information to put them onto the plot before the kidnapped girl's father is contacted by the crooks. Reluctantly, the father allows the police to quietly pursue the three conspirators. After some truly clumsy trailing in one case and undisguised beating and mental torture in the other, one crook dies and another confesses all, leaving the ringleader alone with his own girlfriend and the victim. From there it's a tense manhunt and search for the kidnapped woman, right down to the end. All that sounds rather exciting, and up to a point it is. However, the initial involvement of Olson's character hinges of rather unlikely coincidence, and her continued presence strikes me as highly unrealisic -- she's allowed to hang around and become a de facto participant in trailing and confronting the bad guys. It's all procedure with virtually no texture -- an attempt is made to humanize Holden's character, and there's just enough down town in the propulsive plot line to suggest that he and Olson's character are going to hit it off romantically once the credits are over. But then, at just over 80 minutes in length, this film has little room for anything but the main show. For what it is, that show is pretty compelling if predictable and largely within the box. It's still worth a watch, however. This transfer is excellent.",1359590400,2,2104,4.847222222222222

2244391,4,B0007U7XTE,"Union Station is a rather terrific police procedural that kicks off with one huge coincidence - the armed criminals Nancy Olsen spots on an train to Chicago just happen to have kidnapped her rich employer's blind daughter - and keeps her around for rather longer than the plot mechanics strictly need to provide potential romantic interest for William Holden's all business Union Station cop, but when it works this well, why complain? There's a typical fascination with the business of policing, be it Holden going on his rounds of pickpockets, pimps and conmen or an intricate surveillance operation, but there's also a streak of real nastiness to Lyle Bettger's very, very bad man, who'll not only kill anyone who gets in his way and not care who the stray bullets hit but will even steal your last sandwich. Not that the cops are that much better, getting a quick confession out of one of the gang by nearly throwing him under an oncoming train. The presence of Barry Fitzgerald's soft spoken older cop doing good cop to Holden's bad cop implies that it's all bluff, but the cops of the day weren't always THAT particular when it came to human rights.

The film does miss a few tricks: while it tries to build up some suspense as to whether the victim is even alive or not, there's never much doubt on that one and one promising moment where Bettger's hiding place in the station turns out to be only a few feet away from the police headquarters offers the tantalising possibility that he might be smart enough to be watching them while they think they're watching out for him - but unfortunately it's just a coincidence that's made little of. But so much does work that again it's hard to complain, be it a chase leading to a stampede in a stockyard or the obligatory chase through darkened tunnels, the script and execution always better than they need to be and raising it above the run of the mill even if it never quite makes it to classic. Tightly directed by Rudolph Mat with a good feeling for real locations that are used to great effect and underplayed performances that help add a layer of semi-realism, it's a very satisfying little stopover indeed.

No extras on Olive's DVD but a more than acceptable black and white transfer.",1345507200,5,2244,4.6498740554156175
2244392,4,B0007U7XTE,"Just ordered the DVD of this movie. I had it on VHS, then was able to record it to DVD-R but want a professional copy also. This movie is among my favorite noir. I like William Holden and Barry Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald in Naked City was excellent and he does a good job here also. The late 40's and early 50's were, in my opinion, the golden age of noir. Many fine movies were made in that genre and this is one of them. You had the tough but really sensitive cop or private eye, the girl in distress, the criminal who was out to get everyone, and some really classic settings on locale. Combine that together and you have some really good entertainment. It's a window to a bygone era. I could care less about some of the aspects some reviewers put into their synopsis. It's entertainment, what more do you want?",1325030400,3,810,4.3355263157894735
2244393,3,B0007U7XTE,"No question I am a film noir aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various film noir efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy; films like Out Of the Past, Gilda, The Lady From Shang-hai, and The Big Sleep need no additional comment from me as they stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching (or wicked, for that matter, femme fatale to muddy the waters also get a pass, or as in Gilda a double nod for the plot and for the femme fatale. Be still my heart, at the name Rita Hayworth. I have even tried to salvage some efforts by touting their plot lines, and others by their use of shadowy black and white cinematography to overcome plot problems. Like The Third Man (and, in that case, the bizarre zither-drenched musical score as well). And that brings us to those films, like the film under review, 1951s Union Station, starring William Holden and Nancy Olson that have no redeeming film noir qualities.

Now I mentioned the stars and the year of this film for a purpose. 1951 also saw this pair in one of the great film noir, no, flat-out great films of all time, Sunset Boulevard, so it is not the acting capabilities, although Brother Holden may have been a little tired from playing Norma Desmond's pet or maybe just a little bloated from being in that swimming pool too long. What is missing here is though is any spark in order to get interested in actors or plot.

The plot line, in any case, is rather conventional. A con, or rather ex-con, who had plenty of time on his hands up in stir, decides that from here on in he is going to live on easy street and so whiled away those lonely prison cell hours devising a plot to get, what else, some serious dough. Easy street, after all, is no place for chump change. So naturally the idea is to kidnap a wealthy guy's daughter (who is also blind, so a conveniently easy target), hold her for ransom, and easy street here we come (of course, said con has a moll, a moll who in the end he does wrong as such bad guys will do out of habit, a blonde moll, although such molls are not always blonde).

So you see, a pretty conventional plot, played out very conventionally. See said con used to work at, where else, Union Station (Chicago version), and so the swap (dough for daughter) is to take place there. What brother con did not figure on was that head railroad detective Willy Calhoun (the part played by William Holden, but don't call him Willy to his face, okay) is like some avenging angel-god when criminal hijinks take place in his precinct. A fatal mistake, a very fatal mistake, for brother con. But it takes time, too much time, for him to learn that sad lesson. Oh, and along the way, Willy (remember don't' call him that to his face) ""falls"" for Joyce (played by Nancy Olson), who is the one who tipped him to the possible criminal enterprise that was looming at his place of work. I will take any five minutes, no, any two minutes of Sunset Boulevard over this whole one and one half hour stew. I guess Willy (oops, William)and Nancy needed dough that year themselves.",1305417600,3,3195,4.430272108843537
2244394,4,B0007U7XTE,"I found this movie riveting although I would agree that it is flawed in some of the ways other reviewers here have pointed out.

To me, the star of this movie is the main setting itself -- Union Station.  (It's supposed to be Union Station-Chicago tho it was actually filmed in Union Station-L.A.)  So much of the action takes place amidst the corridors and passageways and train tracks and tunnels underneath Union Station.  (And at one point the action shifts to the Chicago ""El"" train.)  And since every cop in the movie (with one brief exception) is in plain clothes (which in 1950 apparently meant a dark grey suit and tie), there is a constant sense of tension and suspense as they try to follow and trap the criminals amongst the hustle and bustle of the ordinary folks commuting or working in the vast train station.  The station cops have hidden offices on a sort of mezzanine level overlooking the station and constantly spy on the throngs below, trying to spot the kidnappers and ransom bag guys.  An ordinary train station is converted into a eerie locale of spying and cat-and-mouse between cop and criminal.

In fact, the setting is more noir-ish than the characters. To me, the main characters in the film are not ""true"" film noir characters, it's more an ordinary ""good guy"" vs ""bad guy"" sort of crime movie. But the film transforms an ordinary busy big-city train station into ""Dark City Central.""",1293235200,19,1414,4.719512195121951

2244396,4,B0007U7XTE,"This is a review for the VHS tape of UNION STATION, a film which was
originally released by Paramaount Pictures in 1950.  UNION STATION was
directed by veteran Rudolph Mate from a story by Thomas Walsh, a very
popular pulpster at the time.

Secretary Joyce Willecombe , played by Nancy Olsen, notices a gun stuck in the waistband of one of two men who board her commuter train one afternoon and reports it to the conductor.  He tells her to wait until they arrive at Union Station, the large train hub for the unnamed urban area. She does report it to the head of security for the station, Lt. William Calhoun, played by William Holden.

This is just the start of a path that eventually leads to a kidnapping, attempted murder, a $100,000 ransom, an eye-opening treatise on just exactly how big city police really operate, the desperation of ex-cons for one big score and their willingness to die for it.

UNION STATION also portrays what it takes to succesfully run a big operation like the huge railroad station security system  and the dedication as well as possesiveness of ""My station"" to keep it going.

UNION STATION progresses from an afternoon commute scenario to a urban noir nightdream, with plenty of rain slickened streets and unidentifiable tenement- like addresses, some of which may or may not house the kidnappers and a kidnapped blind girl. It is a taut, tense ride through the unnamed urban landscape with a well earned satisfying conclusion.

UNION STATION also shows, with really fine cinematography,the many different forms of railroads and train transport circa 1950 throughout the movie. It could almost serve as a documentary on the subject of the rail transport system of sixty years ago.

Altogther I give UNION STATION four stars for a suprisingly exciting, if little known,
film noir suspenser.",1281916800,16,1823,4.892857142857143
