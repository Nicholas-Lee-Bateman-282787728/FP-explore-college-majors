8201021,5,B000RJCPUW,"I love Campanella, he has a great talent to create beautiful characters and to tell stories of hardship with a joyful tone. This series is very well-crafted. The part telling the story of the father is a bit better than the one about the son, but they are both weaved magnificently.",1292716800,2,282,4.549019607843137
8201022,5,B000RJCPUW,"Actually, this was a very High-scale, very expensive production (it shows) The series was co-produced with Spain's Channel 5. It was filmed both in Argentina and in Spain. Originally, the series aired on TV, with a not-too-surprising very high response from the audiences (Googling this title will direct the seeker to some very interesting discussions about the way in which the TV channels treated the series as a whole). Unfortunately, neither the Spanish Channel nor the Argentinean one gave this series the place that it deserved. It was taken off the air and sent straight to be sold as a dvd collection.
The acting is superb, and the legendary Alterio gives here one of his best performances.
The writing and direction of the series are consistent throughout. Not an easy task on a 13 episode enterprise with a non-linear strategy. Unlike Roots, rightly mentioned by another reviewer, which was linear all the way through, Vientos de Agua builds a complex narrative web that allows the viewer not only to be trapped, but also to make the necessary connections between them and emerge with a better understanding of the complex forces that shape our lives and our relations with the historical context that we inhabit.
From beginning to end, Vientos de Agua is a rare gem in the Spanish television production.",1259280000,6,1315,4.9818181818181815
8201023,5,B000RJCPUW,"Es una de las mejores miniseries que vi en mi vida. Su ambientacion es excelente en cada lugar que recorre, la direccion y actuaciones son impecables y toca con increible afinacion todas las fibras intimas del ser humano: familia, amor, crisis, miserias...Una prueba de que no se necesita un gran presupuesto ni espectaculares efectos especiales para entregar calidad.
Altamente recomendable.",1242172800,4,392,5.55
8201024,5,B000RJCPUW,"OK, I gave it away, I was born in the 80's, and watched the mini-Series Roots as a kid, that series kept me glued to the TV! Since then, I have never seen anything that has had me hooked so bad, that I could not wait to see the next episode. This is the best series I have ever seen, and probably will see in my life time. It touches on all aspects of life, education, work, family values, and all elated to the spin of being an immigrant and trying to learn the local ways and find a way forward. If we look at today's increasingly Global and culturally integrated world, it's a must see for us, as well as our kids, that face or will face these challenges in the future. This film was produced in Argentina, probably with a modest budget, but has the impact of a mega dollar production. Unforgettable.",1204934400,8,803,4.220779220779221
