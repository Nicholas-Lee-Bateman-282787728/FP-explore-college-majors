It's what you would call an ''import'' In other words, it IS manufactured somewhere else (most imports are made in Malaysia) That is why you will find Chinese subtitles or Malay subtitles etc. And also, this is why imports are always region 0 coding...which means it can be played anywhere in the world not just limited to any 1 DVD player. Understand that if say Funimation releases Fullmetal Alchemist it would be considered region 1 release. You do realize this would be dubbed in different languages all around the world right? Different companies would do the dubbing for it. Well, Malaysia and other places will make these DVDs and dub them in whatever language necessary and sell them off at a cheap price. A bootleg is the term for when someone is literally copying a movie onto a video camera via watching it in an actual movie theater etc. If a movie were just hitting theaters it would be impossible for it to be released on DVD right? That is what bootlegging is...don't confuse bootlegs and imports because there is a VERY distinct difference. If you want a perfect example. Look up the Blood+ animated series for the complete collection or the 2 part set, you'll find that there are quite a few different subtitles...even French. Be careful about passing off info as it being a bootleg if you don't know what you're talking about...you could potentially hurt a seller's reputation and their products..you wouldn't like someone doing that to you now would you?",1338595200,3,1493,4.790697674418604
8202409,4,B000RRS17U,"Just like the title says, it isn't a bootleg. The box set of DVDs was originally released in 480i. The quality is pretty low, and that is my only grief with this product. It comes in a tin case with a sleeve. The .hack//G.U. Trilogy movie is included too, which is a nice bonus. All in all, despite the quality, it's a good purchase.",1312848000,,333,4.21875
8202410,5,B000RRS17U,"This is a good series and this set is a good value.

I don't know what the complaints are from some viewers about this being a  bootleg, it is an import release and I think some people are just used to higher quality packaging from US releases and don't realize that packaging is different in different countries.

And the other question about why would it have English and Chinese subtitles? Malaysian and Hong Kong releases often have both because their two biggest export locations are China and the US.",1303516800,,506,4.662921348314606
8202411,1,B000RRS17U,"Why would something in English and Japanese have Chinese subtitles? The answer is that it's a bootleg. This is a crying shame. Why pay for something you can get for free? If you're paying for something, then you should get the real thing! Two thumbs down.",1262044800,,255,4.565217391304348
8202412,1,B000RRS17U,"No I don't own this series, but it is a good series and this ""boxset"" is obviously bootleg. So if you don't care about bootleg stuff then whatever, but for everyone else I strongly reccomend buying the real boxset, whenever its eventually released or just buy the regular dvds, if you refuse to wait or something then just download some fansubs or whatever, but do not pay for a bootleg product. Buy the genuine dvds instead, they deserve some credit and money for their efforts, .hack//roots, is awesome, and actually so are the other .hack animes as well. Anyways, just wanted to clear this up for anyone who might inadvertantly purchase this set thinking they are getting something legit for some reason.",1231804800,15,707,4.80327868852459
