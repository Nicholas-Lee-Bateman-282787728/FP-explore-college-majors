I was part of the grip crew, setting lights and dolly track, etc ( though unfortunately nothing to do with the post production )  and remember at the time it being very hokey. I'm actually at the beginning of the Louise Mandrell segment for about 1 second LOL

Too bad the audio quality is horrible, I can't believe anyone would issue this sounding that way.  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, if you're a fan of 70's and 80's TV stars, then maybe this could be of interest.  But with the sound quality SO bad, it's barely watchable.  Nice flashback for me though...",1420502400,,679,4.349206349206349
7944996,1,B00005LQ3Z,"I was a bit under the weather for a few days this past Holiday Season, so I curled up with some Christmassy videos that I had never quite gotten around to watching.  Most were charming, in a cheesy sort of way. This one, however, was the absolute worst.  I don't even think I'd put it in a yard sale.  I love Mel Torme's vocals, but while he's the ostensible host, he doesn't really get all that much screen time.  And even he's not at his absolute best.  Other performers include Barbara Eden, Crystal Gayle and Paul Sorvino.  The acoustics are atrocious, so it's hard to know whether the Sorvino--who is certainly an appealing actor--can actually sing as well, but what's presented here is not promising.  Eden and Gayle keep in low key, and their modest efforts work, for the most part.  In between musical numbers, guest hosts provide intros that are completely drowned out by awful holiday music played on a Wurlitzer or something.  Someone below suggested licensing problems, which may well be the case.  But it is just so ludicrous to see a somewhat distinguished presence like Patrick Macnee or a charming performer like actress Lee Purcell mouth words that you cannot begin hear.  And that's ALL they do.  If they were in skits or something as well, then their presence might make some sense. As it is, their bits look preposterously stupid and should have been edited out, if they could not be used legally for whatever reason.  A completely unenjoyable experience.",1230940800,,1475,4.75984251968504
7944997,2,B00005LQ3Z,"This is a neat TV christmas special from the 1990s. The problem is that (I guess for music licensing reasons) bad music is dubbed over many scenes.

In other words, you see Barbara Eden on you screen but you can barely hear her because there is generic christmas music dubbed over her audio (I assume to cover up some background music.)

Plus the dubbed tunes are just awful. They sound like old cell phone ring tones.",1197244800,,418,4.4868421052631575
