7958715,4,B0000635YC,"The fotage in this is pretty incredible to actualy see the plains entering the twin towers. A lot of other DVD's don't even bother to scratch the surface on the actual sights of not only New Yorkers but the world. This rates second on the 911 coverage on DVD. The commerative film makers DVD is the best soul grabber. There is so much to be covered about the attacks
why, how, when, ? This video explains what CNN did that day maybe less. Buy it if your curious about the 767 Boeings entering the towers. In respect to the thousands who lost there lives and the families effected by 911, people should be aware of what happend that day. 911 is the most interesting and horrific event ever.",1049155200,19,689,4.390625
