The points made in the film are speculation and not solid science, but this is understandable as the film is based on a book authored by Mark Lynas, who has a formal education in history and politics. His interpretation of statistical climate models is simplistic at best as would be to the lay person.

I saw ""Six Degrees"" on the National Geographic Channel, and the author of the book was recently interviewed on C-SPAN's BookTV.  As impactful as these media efforts have been, social change is being stalled by reckless voices on radio stations around the country (Limbaugh alone is on over 700 stations) who are misinforming millions of politically engaged people.

The statement says sufficient scientific understanding of climate change exists for all nations to identify cost-effective steps that can be taken now to contribute to substantial and long-term reductions in net global greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.

3094874,2,B0012Q3T72,"Since this documentary is so way-over the top, a few critical words about it.

If shows climate effects that are expected, by some scientists (though not all), to occur as a result of C02 produced from human activities over the next century, with a section devoted to each 1 degree celsius of warming projected, except that the last degree is left out-6 degrees of warming-which according to the documentary ""scientists don't know what will happen... and don't want to find out"". (Well the world has been 6 degrees warmer before and it didn't end, but anyway).

To begin with, as a professional geologist who is aware of past geological changes, I don't necessarily think they have got most of the worst case scenarios here wrong, it's just that I do tend to suspect they have got the rates wrong, and that the effects depicted in this film will take a lot longer to occur than is depicted (think in terms of hundreds or even thousands of years, not in decades) based on past rates of geological change and the buffering capacity of most earth processes. Such views should be more investigated in the scientific literature and in films such as this, (the father of modern geology- James Hutton- after all was also a strong believer in gradualism, who probably would have thought much the same thing).

The film claims to use past earth history to project what might happen, but fails to mention that these past earth changes took thousands and even millions of years to occur in the vast majority of cases (eg past volcanic C02 producing greenhouse over millions of years, not decades). But why should the earth produce the same large-scale changes, but just all speeded up, just because WE are here, like in some 'Day After Tomorrow' disaster movie?

The assumption pervading this film is that:
  `oh yes large-scale climate changes in the past took thousands to millions of years, but we are doing these things- like  adding c02 to the atmosphere-much faster than nature ever has'"" (actually questionable),

but this statement doesn't mean that the earth will necessarily REACT faster to increased inputs. There is a concept in chemistry called 'buffering', which basically means just because you increase the rate of something, doesnt mean the rate of change budges much at all. So just how much are the earth various climate system's buffered to change? The geological record suggests they are nearly always very slow to change, even regardless of input rate. This implies that they are strongly buffered to fast changes.

To take an example where the film has got this 'rate' effect completely wrong, they use the UN IPCC's Himalayan glacier (propaganda) statement that they ""could all melt by 2035"", which turned out to be a date put in the IPCC report by politically-biased IPCC scientists, and nothing to do whatsoever with any scientific data or review. The UN's IPCC has since admitted and retracted the statement, which even under the worst case scenarios won't occur for hundreds or even thousands of years.

Are the rest of the scenarios shown in this film (and in the IPCC report) also not likely to occur for hundreds or even thousands of years? How does one know, for example, that the IPCC hasn't done much the same exageration and other rate errors in the rest of the IPCC report, but which are just more difficult to prove as false or exaggerated?

 The geological record suggests it generally takes very long time periods for the earth to move in such directions as in this film (sea levels, ice melting, etc), and often regardless of increased rate of inputs. Such scientific evidence from the past is routinely ignored by some,  I suspect for the same reason the IPCC scientists ignored criticism that the Himalayan glacier melting rate was wrong before the report was published (and ignored later also by the Chair of the IPCC) even when it was pointed out to them, for political reasons. ""We wanted to highlight its importance to the region...so we kept the statement in..."" (IPCC scientists), ie they kept the statement in there for political reasons, not scientific ones (they would have made good directors of disaster movies). They wanted to do what they believed was the right thing, so they ignore valid critical review. The Chairman of the UN's IPCC described the Himalayan glacier criticism as ""voodoo science"", without bothering to investigate, but which just happened later to turn out to be entirely valid criticism and dead wrong. Is there an attitude problem with such scientists upon which these sort of statements and films are based?. The answer would have to be yes, by their OWN words.

To take the glacier example again, there is no physical way to melt that much ice that quickly under ANY climate circumstances, even if the rate of warming vastly increases. This is now admitted by the IPCC. The same is true of Greenland ice, it is physically impossible to melt that much ice in less than hundreds or even thousands of years in even the worst case scenarios.

Other questionable things in the film: New York subway 25 feet underwater more or less permanently, deserts widespread in the western US, numerous world cities drowned by rising sea level, millions of climate refugees from places like India which has run out of government-propaganda water,  etc etc. (By the way, one of the UN's environment programs also predicted that by this last year- 2010-2011- there would be hundreds of thousands of 'climate refugees', so far: ZERO, the statement has been withdrawn quietly from the UNs environment program website).

If some scientists consistently get statements and scenarios like the above 2 wrong, do you think they will get the past geological record right, which suggests at least, that the earth is strongly buffered to fast climate changes, which is perhaps why past large scale changes generally take thousands to millions of years to occur (rather than that the natural input rates were slower)?

One always hears about 'runaway greenhouse' this or 'runaway greenhouse' that, why doesn't one ever hear about the concept of `buffering'. The oceans are a good example, they are strongly buffered to chemical changes (not mentioned anywhere in this film). Just like the Indian scientists in the IPCC, highlighting the buffering capacties of the earth doesn't suit politically, just like the film `The Day After Tomorrow' slowed down 10,000 years would make a hell of a boring disaster film. Half the IPCC scientists would have to go back to their day jobs, such as the current chairman, -a railway engineer-who would have to go back to work on the railways (or his very thorough, painstaking investigations of `voodoo science').

Which would you prefer for your rental DVD? watching sea level rise 1.7mm/ year for thousands of years (the ACTUAL current rate, as well as the rate in many geological past changes, despite relative changes in inputs), or watching the Day After Tomorrow's storm surge swamping the New York subway?. That will be $5.95, and don't forget to return your DVD by tomorrow after you have watched the sea level rise 1/365th of 1.7mm/year for a couple of very boring hours.

I do think some scientists are mixing up science fiction with science, and can't tell the difference. This 'documentary' is a good example.",1315612800,2,7292,4.922638436482084
3094875,5,B0012Q3T72,"I've seen several videos and read several books on climate change, and this is the clearest explanation I've seen so far.

From what I've learned from other scientifically-based sources, this video is accurate and not mere fear-mongering. It's true that nobody knows if these in fact are worst-case scenarios. But there is indication now that warming may be happening faster than predicted - the arctic, for example, is apparently melting faster than expected.

Usage of oil and coal - energy in general - is accelerating, not decreasing. The third world is only getting started on industrialization. The US shows little will to decrease it's carbon output. Overall, it appears to me that continued warming is now inevitable. The only question is how fast we want it to get really bad. This is my conclusion after studying the matter.

If you are in doubt about whether human-caused warming is occurring, I encourage you to look at all sides before you make a decision. From what I've found, on the ""yes"" side you have scientists for whom this is their expertise - geophysicists and such. On the ""no"" side you have mostly oil companies and people who are not specialists in climate science. A recent study shows that 97 percent of climate scientist say it is real. In the scientific community, the debate is over. The only place you see debate is in venues that have an agenda - and where you will often find the vested interests throwing up as big a smoke screen as possible, to try to obscure the scientific evidence.

3094878,5,B0012Q3T72,"Excellent, well-paced documentary; kept me watching all the way through. Of course it's advocacy. What do you expect? Most worthwhile discussions of political topics are advocacy. It's up to you to decide what to think about such discussions, based on the evidence and your own policy preferences. The same people who complain that films like this are one-sided are perfectly happy to get their `news' from Fox News. For them, one-sidedness is OK so long as it's their side.

And of course the film is simplistic. 90 minutes isn't enough for a PhD dissertation or academic paper. The film  dramatizes the conclusions of a variety of climate scientists. The book it's based on (Six Degrees by Mark Lynas, who shows up quite a lot in the film) notes over and over that many of these conclusions, particularly the more extreme ones, are highly speculative; no one knows exactly what will happen in extreme conditions. (The film says this too, now and then). Of course. These are possibilities, only. Some scientists think they are serious dangers. It's worth listening to them.

The scariest things in the film for me, though, weren't the dramatic scenes of wildfires and super-storms and massive destruction of the Amazon. One of the scariest was a nice segment showing vinyards in England growing champagne grapes. English champagne! You have to have lived in England forty years ago to know just how wrong that sounds. No one had been able to make wine in England for centuries. Now it's a paying proposition.

The biggest problem in environmentalist films is the pathetic nature of the solutions offered. We are exhorted to drive smaller cars, turn off appliances, etc. How hollow and silly this kind of thing is is shown in the film itself. One scientist has spent years researching the carbon footprint of cheeseburgers in the US. Turns out it is bigger than the carbon footprint of all the SUVs in the US. Clearly we have a problem too big for individuals here, if junking every SUV would have less impact than eliminating one particular kind of meal.

The bottom line for climate change is that it really isn't about religion, ideology, or politics. You can argue about those topics forever, and there will never be proof to convince the true believers on the other side. With climate change, however, it is either happening or it isn't. If it isn't, environmentalists' arguments won't mean anything. But if it is, all the claims of the skeptics, all their advocacy, all the money paid by energy companies and others to support them, will not turn down the Earth's thermostat by a tenth of a degree. Climate change will simply be an accomplished fact. Of course, by then, it will be too late to do anything about it.",1266451200,8,2721,4.830472103004292
3094879,5,B0012Q3T72,"This DVD and the book it was based on by Mark Lynas are the only attempt I know of to put together much of what scientists are predicting for the effects of global warming. They answer a question I have had since learning about the problem: what will happen if we let temperatures rise a certain amount? The answers are organized into one degree steps. The book and DVD overlap but each covers quite a bit that they other doesn't, so it is well worth getting both.

Some people will give one star to anything that conveys what climate scientists are saying about global warming. If you have already made up your mind despite the overwhelming evidence, don't bother watching this DVD or reading the book. They make no attempt to prove anything, they simply lay out what scientists are predicting. But if you can at least tentatively accept that what the vast majority of experts are saying might indeed be true, then you will want to know what they are predicting for our future.

Of course you can't expect everything scientists are predicting to be 100% accurate. But I have been following the science for several years, and I can tell you without a doubt that in the vast majority of cases where the scientists were off, they were too optimistic, often by a large amount. Global warming deniers criticize the computer climate model predictions, but in the wrong way. As a whole, they are much more optimistic than they should be, and the reason is that they don't know how to include the various positive feedbacks in their equations. The simplest proof of this is that when they run the models for years in the past for which we have paleoclimatology data, they consistently predict the changes will be slower and less drastic than what actually happened. If they do this for past changes, they will probably do so for future changes too. This DVD has predictions based on these models and on the paleoclimatic data. The scariest predictions come from paleoclimatology, and unfortunately those are probably more accurate. So keep that in mind as you watch it.

The data that has come out since the DVD was made already indicate that some things will be happening sooner than was thought then. For example, arctic sea ice is melting much faster than predicted, and coral reefs are dying off faster than anyone thought possible. Here is another thing to keep in mind. Because of thermal inertia, the albedo feedback that is already in full force, and because of global dimming effects, temperatures are already guaranteed to rise at least one more degree. The Amazon was carbon neutral over the past 10 years, and when it turns into a carbon source, that will cause the temperature to rise another degree. Two to three derees more warming are when other feedbacks are predicted to take over, pushing global temperature even higher. So please realize that we have very little time left to prevent the worst things shown in this DVD. Do whatever you can to convince Congress and the President to treat this threat as more serious and urgent than a world war. If we don't make at least the same quality of effort as we did when fighting past world wars, we will not win this battle, and the consequences will be far worse than if we had lost those wars. We all have a patriotic and moral obligation to do our part, and the most effective thing you can do now is make our leaders do their duty to protect our future.

P.S. Note to the person who thought the DVD showed a nuclear plant's cooling tower: coal power plants also use cooling towers. It would have been better to show a chimney, where the CO2 is released, but the footage probably was from a coal power plant.",1253404800,3,3667,4.636923076923077
3094880,1,B0012Q3T72,Six degrees works in both way. In the late 60's and early 70's environmentalist were preaching that CO2 would cause the earth to go into another ice age.

3329371,2,B0012Q3T72,"Since this documentary is so way-over the top, a few critical words about it.

If shows climate effects that are expected, by some scientists (though not all), to occur as a result of C02 produced from human activities over the next century, with a section devoted to each 1 degree celsius of warming projected, except that the last degree is left out-6 degrees of warming-which according to the documentary ""scientists don't know what will happen... and don't want to find out"". (Well the world has been 6 degrees warmer before and it didn't end, but anyway).

To begin with, as a professional geologist who is aware of past geological changes, I don't necessarily think they have got most of the worst case scenarios here wrong, it's just that I do tend to suspect they have got the rates wrong, and that the effects depicted in this film will take a lot longer to occur than is depicted (think in terms of hundreds or even thousands of years, not in decades) based on past rates of geological change and the buffering capacity of most earth processes. Such views should be more investigated in the scientific literature and in films such as this, (the father of modern geology- James Hutton- after all was also a strong believer in gradualism, who probably would have thought much the same thing).

The film claims to use past earth history to project what might happen, but fails to mention that these past earth changes took thousands and even millions of years to occur in the vast majority of cases (eg past volcanic C02 producing greenhouse over millions of years, not decades). But why should the earth produce the same large-scale changes, but just all speeded up, just because WE are here, like in some 'Day After Tomorrow' disaster movie?

The assumption pervading this film is that:
  `oh yes large-scale climate changes in the past took thousands to millions of years, but we are doing these things- like  adding c02 to the atmosphere-much faster than nature ever has'"" (actually questionable),

but this statement doesn't mean that the earth will necessarily REACT faster to increased inputs. There is a concept in chemistry called 'buffering', which basically means just because you increase the rate of something, doesnt mean the rate of change budges much at all. So just how much are the earth various climate system's buffered to change? The geological record suggests they are nearly always very slow to change, even regardless of input rate. This implies that they are strongly buffered to fast changes.

To take an example where the film has got this 'rate' effect completely wrong, they use the UN IPCC's Himalayan glacier (propaganda) statement that they ""could all melt by 2035"", which turned out to be a date put in the IPCC report by politically-biased IPCC scientists, and nothing to do whatsoever with any scientific data or review. The UN's IPCC has since admitted and retracted the statement, which even under the worst case scenarios won't occur for hundreds or even thousands of years.

Are the rest of the scenarios shown in this film (and in the IPCC report) also not likely to occur for hundreds or even thousands of years? How does one know, for example, that the IPCC hasn't done much the same exageration and other rate errors in the rest of the IPCC report, but which are just more difficult to prove as false or exaggerated?

 The geological record suggests it generally takes very long time periods for the earth to move in such directions as in this film (sea levels, ice melting, etc), and often regardless of increased rate of inputs. Such scientific evidence from the past is routinely ignored by some,  I suspect for the same reason the IPCC scientists ignored criticism that the Himalayan glacier melting rate was wrong before the report was published (and ignored later also by the Chair of the IPCC) even when it was pointed out to them, for political reasons. ""We wanted to highlight its importance to the region...so we kept the statement in..."" (IPCC scientists), ie they kept the statement in there for political reasons, not scientific ones (they would have made good directors of disaster movies). They wanted to do what they believed was the right thing, so they ignore valid critical review. The Chairman of the UN's IPCC described the Himalayan glacier criticism as ""voodoo science"", without bothering to investigate, but which just happened later to turn out to be entirely valid criticism and dead wrong. Is there an attitude problem with such scientists upon which these sort of statements and films are based?. The answer would have to be yes, by their OWN words.

To take the glacier example again, there is no physical way to melt that much ice that quickly under ANY climate circumstances, even if the rate of warming vastly increases. This is now admitted by the IPCC. The same is true of Greenland ice, it is physically impossible to melt that much ice in less than hundreds or even thousands of years in even the worst case scenarios.

Other questionable things in the film: New York subway 25 feet underwater more or less permanently, deserts widespread in the western US, numerous world cities drowned by rising sea level, millions of climate refugees from places like India which has run out of government-propaganda water,  etc etc. (By the way, one of the UN's environment programs also predicted that by this last year- 2010-2011- there would be hundreds of thousands of 'climate refugees', so far: ZERO, the statement has been withdrawn quietly from the UNs environment program website).

If some scientists consistently get statements and scenarios like the above 2 wrong, do you think they will get the past geological record right, which suggests at least, that the earth is strongly buffered to fast climate changes, which is perhaps why past large scale changes generally take thousands to millions of years to occur (rather than that the natural input rates were slower)?

One always hears about 'runaway greenhouse' this or 'runaway greenhouse' that, why doesn't one ever hear about the concept of `buffering'. The oceans are a good example, they are strongly buffered to chemical changes (not mentioned anywhere in this film). Just like the Indian scientists in the IPCC, highlighting the buffering capacties of the earth doesn't suit politically, just like the film `The Day After Tomorrow' slowed down 10,000 years would make a hell of a boring disaster film. Half the IPCC scientists would have to go back to their day jobs, such as the current chairman, -a railway engineer-who would have to go back to work on the railways (or his very thorough, painstaking investigations of `voodoo science').

Which would you prefer for your rental DVD? watching sea level rise 1.7mm/ year for thousands of years (the ACTUAL current rate, as well as the rate in many geological past changes, despite relative changes in inputs), or watching the Day After Tomorrow's storm surge swamping the New York subway?. That will be $5.95, and don't forget to return your DVD by tomorrow after you have watched the sea level rise 1/365th of 1.7mm/year for a couple of very boring hours.

I do think some scientists are mixing up science fiction with science, and can't tell the difference. This 'documentary' is a good example.",1315612800,2,7292,4.922638436482084
3329372,5,B0012Q3T72,"I've seen several videos and read several books on climate change, and this is the clearest explanation I've seen so far.

From what I've learned from other scientifically-based sources, this video is accurate and not mere fear-mongering. It's true that nobody knows if these in fact are worst-case scenarios. But there is indication now that warming may be happening faster than predicted - the arctic, for example, is apparently melting faster than expected.

Usage of oil and coal - energy in general - is accelerating, not decreasing. The third world is only getting started on industrialization. The US shows little will to decrease it's carbon output. Overall, it appears to me that continued warming is now inevitable. The only question is how fast we want it to get really bad. This is my conclusion after studying the matter.

If you are in doubt about whether human-caused warming is occurring, I encourage you to look at all sides before you make a decision. From what I've found, on the ""yes"" side you have scientists for whom this is their expertise - geophysicists and such. On the ""no"" side you have mostly oil companies and people who are not specialists in climate science. A recent study shows that 97 percent of climate scientist say it is real. In the scientific community, the debate is over. The only place you see debate is in venues that have an agenda - and where you will often find the vested interests throwing up as big a smoke screen as possible, to try to obscure the scientific evidence.

3329375,5,B0012Q3T72,"Excellent, well-paced documentary; kept me watching all the way through. Of course it's advocacy. What do you expect? Most worthwhile discussions of political topics are advocacy. It's up to you to decide what to think about such discussions, based on the evidence and your own policy preferences. The same people who complain that films like this are one-sided are perfectly happy to get their `news' from Fox News. For them, one-sidedness is OK so long as it's their side.

And of course the film is simplistic. 90 minutes isn't enough for a PhD dissertation or academic paper. The film  dramatizes the conclusions of a variety of climate scientists. The book it's based on (Six Degrees by Mark Lynas, who shows up quite a lot in the film) notes over and over that many of these conclusions, particularly the more extreme ones, are highly speculative; no one knows exactly what will happen in extreme conditions. (The film says this too, now and then). Of course. These are possibilities, only. Some scientists think they are serious dangers. It's worth listening to them.

The scariest things in the film for me, though, weren't the dramatic scenes of wildfires and super-storms and massive destruction of the Amazon. One of the scariest was a nice segment showing vinyards in England growing champagne grapes. English champagne! You have to have lived in England forty years ago to know just how wrong that sounds. No one had been able to make wine in England for centuries. Now it's a paying proposition.

The biggest problem in environmentalist films is the pathetic nature of the solutions offered. We are exhorted to drive smaller cars, turn off appliances, etc. How hollow and silly this kind of thing is is shown in the film itself. One scientist has spent years researching the carbon footprint of cheeseburgers in the US. Turns out it is bigger than the carbon footprint of all the SUVs in the US. Clearly we have a problem too big for individuals here, if junking every SUV would have less impact than eliminating one particular kind of meal.

The bottom line for climate change is that it really isn't about religion, ideology, or politics. You can argue about those topics forever, and there will never be proof to convince the true believers on the other side. With climate change, however, it is either happening or it isn't. If it isn't, environmentalists' arguments won't mean anything. But if it is, all the claims of the skeptics, all their advocacy, all the money paid by energy companies and others to support them, will not turn down the Earth's thermostat by a tenth of a degree. Climate change will simply be an accomplished fact. Of course, by then, it will be too late to do anything about it.",1266451200,8,2721,4.830472103004292
3329376,5,B0012Q3T72,"This DVD and the book it was based on by Mark Lynas are the only attempt I know of to put together much of what scientists are predicting for the effects of global warming. They answer a question I have had since learning about the problem: what will happen if we let temperatures rise a certain amount? The answers are organized into one degree steps. The book and DVD overlap but each covers quite a bit that they other doesn't, so it is well worth getting both.

Some people will give one star to anything that conveys what climate scientists are saying about global warming. If you have already made up your mind despite the overwhelming evidence, don't bother watching this DVD or reading the book. They make no attempt to prove anything, they simply lay out what scientists are predicting. But if you can at least tentatively accept that what the vast majority of experts are saying might indeed be true, then you will want to know what they are predicting for our future.

Of course you can't expect everything scientists are predicting to be 100% accurate. But I have been following the science for several years, and I can tell you without a doubt that in the vast majority of cases where the scientists were off, they were too optimistic, often by a large amount. Global warming deniers criticize the computer climate model predictions, but in the wrong way. As a whole, they are much more optimistic than they should be, and the reason is that they don't know how to include the various positive feedbacks in their equations. The simplest proof of this is that when they run the models for years in the past for which we have paleoclimatology data, they consistently predict the changes will be slower and less drastic than what actually happened. If they do this for past changes, they will probably do so for future changes too. This DVD has predictions based on these models and on the paleoclimatic data. The scariest predictions come from paleoclimatology, and unfortunately those are probably more accurate. So keep that in mind as you watch it.

The data that has come out since the DVD was made already indicate that some things will be happening sooner than was thought then. For example, arctic sea ice is melting much faster than predicted, and coral reefs are dying off faster than anyone thought possible. Here is another thing to keep in mind. Because of thermal inertia, the albedo feedback that is already in full force, and because of global dimming effects, temperatures are already guaranteed to rise at least one more degree. The Amazon was carbon neutral over the past 10 years, and when it turns into a carbon source, that will cause the temperature to rise another degree. Two to three derees more warming are when other feedbacks are predicted to take over, pushing global temperature even higher. So please realize that we have very little time left to prevent the worst things shown in this DVD. Do whatever you can to convince Congress and the President to treat this threat as more serious and urgent than a world war. If we don't make at least the same quality of effort as we did when fighting past world wars, we will not win this battle, and the consequences will be far worse than if we had lost those wars. We all have a patriotic and moral obligation to do our part, and the most effective thing you can do now is make our leaders do their duty to protect our future.

P.S. Note to the person who thought the DVD showed a nuclear plant's cooling tower: coal power plants also use cooling towers. It would have been better to show a chimney, where the CO2 is released, but the footage probably was from a coal power plant.",1253404800,3,3667,4.636923076923077
3329377,1,B0012Q3T72,Six degrees works in both way. In the late 60's and early 70's environmentalist were preaching that CO2 would cause the earth to go into another ice age. Funny how they can reverse this theory when we go through a few years of hotter than normal temperatures. Guess what? We're going through cooler temperature again for the next several years and their regrouping again even trying to explain why the perma frost will not melt as quick as they had predicted.

It explored a quickly approaching future, a task that sometimes can be daunting when working with climate change.  While I'm sure they left many things out of the documentary, because you can't possibly cover every nuance of climate change in an hour and a half, the key points were made about the environmental expectations overall.

In addition, the documentary made the point to make sure the audience knew that the degree in the title is Celsius, but continually converted it to Fahrenheit for continual ease of understanding of myself along with millions of other Americans without the knowledge of the conversion rate from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

I would certainly recommend this documentary to all of those who are wondering how climate change will affect them.  Also, to those non-believers, this will wake them up!",1223856000,5,916,5.12751677852349

It opens your eyes dramatically to see what impact you have on the world around you. The fight against nature will be impossible but the fight to help nature will be rewarding. As a citizen in the United States we have enough resources to solve the problem not only for us but for the smaller countries who have not contributed even a fraction of what we have to the issue but will suffer the most. I believe that over time when documentaries like this become more exposed people will realize the importance of their everyday actions and purchases. There are already dramatic changes that need to be directly blamed on our carbon foot print instead of just a freak instance of nature. Once the truth about global warming is really presented to the people I believe 100% that there will be a reform and the industrial world will have to change their ways for good.,1480982400,,1018,4.5989010989010985
