332507,5,6301528891,"THE ANN JILLIAN STORY is a must-own for all fans of the brilliant, beautiful singer/actress.  Miss Jillian plays herself in this well-crafted 1988 TV movie about her struggles with breast cancer and her marriage.

The film opens in the 1970's.  Ann is virtually a has-been and trying to get herself back onto the world stage.  In Chicago while touring as a singer, she falls in love with vice cop Andy (Tony Lo Bianco).  He becomes her manager and they later marry.  Ann's star rises when she gets a role in the national tour of SUGAR BABIES, and later the pair move to Los Angeles with her parents.

In 1985, just as she is preparing to play the Red Queen in the lavish 2-part TV musical of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, she discovers a lump in her breast.  Soon the lump starts growing and she has to undergo a mastectomy, later submitting to a gruelling regime of chemotherapy.

There are some great moments in this movie.  Ann gets to sing four numbers (including her big ALICE IN WONDERLAND ballad ""Emotions"").  Viveca Lindfors plays Ann's mother.

For Ann Jillian fans, this is a must-own!",1113523200,5,1086,4.628272251308901
