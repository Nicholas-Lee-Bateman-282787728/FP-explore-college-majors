3598478,5,B001GBIOTG,"I am so grateful for the Total Immersion program.  I've been swimming all my life.  I swim regularly for exercise, and I did summer swim team as a kid.  I've always been good at breaststroke, but I've never felt as comfortable or as proficient at freestyle.  This DVD breaks the stroke down into easy-to-master pieces.  I've never had a swim teacher or coach give me such helpful lessons as I've found in this program.  Also, any time I've had difficulty with a lesson in the DVD, I've gotten a quick, professional response from the forums on [...]

It has taken patience and a lot of practice to master these techniques.  But the results have been amazing.

3598481,4,B001GBIOTG,The video was well organized with very good examples shown in slow motion. I was very suprised when I first watched it that the beginning drills were not the same as the book copyright 2004.  I had purchased the video to reinforce the my understanding of the drills described in the book. After trying the new drills I found that the video was an improvement over the book.  The primary change is starting the drills on your stomach versus your back. The other big change is less of a rotation of the shoulders.  After a week of practicing the drills I  reduced my stroke per lap from 12 to 9 and felt much more efficient and comfortable in the water.,1237593600,12,651,4.4
3598482,4,B001GBIOTG,"These instructions are for beginner freestyle swimmers. It clears up many of the common mistakes made by self taught swimmers.

3598483,5,B001GBIOTG,"I am training for a triathlon with a 1.5 mile swim and even though I already ""know"" how to swim (I took an intermediate swim class in college), I know there is a lot of room for improvement in my stroke.

The Total Immersion company puts on two day workshops to teach you how to swim, but they are pretty pricey at $500-700 if I remember correctly.  I opted to buy the Total Immersion book for $11 instead.  While the book was quite helpful and insightful, it didn't cut my strokes and effort levels nearly as dramatically as many raving fans had experienced.  The book also contains some seriously bad drawings that you are left to interpret then try to imitate in the pool (while guessing what your form looks like).  Since that wasn't the best, I figured I'd give it another chance by buying this DVD ($20-something if you go with one of the non-Amazon sellers like I did).

This DVD was very helpful for me.  I instantly discovered that I had been doing some of the drills from the book incorrectly by watching the swim technique in action.  While there are some inconsistencies with the book (different drills at least), overall it was very helpful at reinforcing what I learned and taking me to the next level.  I finally had my moment in the pool where I dropped a significant number of strokes off each length while simultaneously feeling like I was using less effort to get across the pool!  I am very excited to use what I have learned during my triathlon.

You probably won't become Michael Phelps by watching this video, but if you want to take your game to the next level as a recreational swimmer or triathlete, I would highly recommend this video.",1236124800,58,1662,4.525083612040134
3598484,5,B001GBIOTG,"A few weeks ago, a friend convinced me to do a sprint triathlon with him in a few months. Soon thereafter, I decided to go to my gym's pool to see how far I could swim, just to gauge how much work lay ahead. I already knew *how* to swim (via years of lessons at the Y) but figured I needed to work on my fitness level. To my shock, at the end of maybe 75 yds, I had to stop. I was exhuasted, gasping, and had a heart rate through the roof. Even though I'm in decent shape, i figured I must be out of shape for swimming. So to the gym I went, faithfully churning out lap after exhausting lap, trying to kick and splash my way to fitness. But part of me knew there was something wrong. I would see the 65 year old guys doing lap after effortless lap and thought there must be a better way. Well, THIS is that better way. The TI system was recommended in Joe Friel's ""Your first Triathlon"" and his highly regarded ""The Triathlete's Trainig Bible"" as well as in ""Chi Running"".
  Now there's nothing magical or mysterious about the TI system. Some of it is just sound swimming technique known by others for a long time (eg looking down, body rotation, streamlining, etc). But there are other aspects that seem to be unique to TI. Where the system really shines is in the step-wise approach and skill-specific drills to building a smoother and more efficient stroke. It's broken down so logically and systematically that one can't help but to improve one's freestyle stroke by simply trying to execute its lessons.
  The DVD itself is of decent quality, more than adequate to accomplish its goal. While a couple of the video sequences look as though the camera operator was drunk, it is mostly well-filmed and it is easy to see the details of the drill that is being explained. They are shot both above and below the water and from multiple angles, sometimes even using split screens to enhance understanding. The music and graphics are a little cheap but who really cares. Before a pool session, I usually watch a chapter while taking notes. Then I bring my notes with me to the pool (in a ziplock bag) to jog my memory of the important points I need to keep in mind. This really works but it's not magic. You'll have to drill, be patient, and get to the pool regularly.
  While the DVD itself will be sure to improve your stroke, I think the weekend TI workshop is extremely helpful in making sure you're doing the drills properly. Until you see underwater video of yourself, it's really hard to get an accurate sense of how efficient your stroke really is.
  All in all, an extremely useful DVD for anyone (especially triathletes) who wants to improve their freestyle. Highly recommended!

UPDATE:3/2/2014

I have done about 15 triathlons (mostly sprints but also 3 olympic distance tris) since I wrote this review. Then I took last year off for a variety of reasons. I hardly exercised at all (sad, I know). I restarted training this January and figured it would take weeks (or longer) to be able to swim a mile nonstop again. By the 3rd pool session I was back up to a mile (granted it wasn't my fastest). I had not swum regularly since my last tri in august of 2012. I'm sure my form has degraded and i KNOW my fitness has but, just using what i learned way back then, I was able to do it! It's (nearly) all technique! I remember when a mile swim seemed impossible. Now I can do a mile with relative ease. I have even done 2 miles non-stop (it was in 2012 and, I won't lie, it wasn't easy). I still stand by my original review. And, no, I have no affiliation with TI. Hope this helps.

3598491,5,B001GBIOTG,I learned the freestyle stroke in 2008 using this after having a friend that did triathlons let me borrow it (I swim laps for exercise). Super easy to learn from. Lessons build on each other and you can easily see how to combine the previous one to build the next step in your stroke. Learn at your own pace. Have had compliments on my stroke ever since learning the TI method! I have the perpetual motion freestyle DVD too and didn't find it nearly as user friendly/easy to learn same stroke from.,1402790400,3,498,4.423913043478261
3598492,5,B001GBIOTG,The drills in the first lesson on this DVD made a huge difference in my swimming.  I was able to swim for 15 mins straight after practicing the drills twice.  Well worth the money.,1399248000,2,180,4.264705882352941
3598493,3,B001GBIOTG,"I actually fell asleep 3 times while watching it. While I understand the concepts (mostly) it just didn't resonate with me very well. Maybe my problem is that I didn't enjoy at all the drills and it felt so monotonous that I was dreading pool time. Not the attitude you want. I wasn't seeing much progress - but I'm not sure what I was supposed to be seeing. It is definitely presented as a one size fits all approach. There were some great parts like the balance and fluidity in the water which I found helpful.

The very slow, very long, strokes flat did not work for me at all. I've seen it so beautifully with other swimmers in the pool. That effortless look. I just look like I am struggling when I try to lengthen strokes and almost glide more. I couldn't get a good rhythm and breath going. I'm sure this works for a great many folks. In the end I went with a different method where I ended up with more strokes which creates a better rhythm and breathing capacity for me and feels more natural. More efficient for me. I'm short with short arms - maybe that has something to do with it. I don't know enough about technique to critique that - I'm still learning and working on mine.

I think perhaps an in person clinic with some coaching would prove most helpful. Perhaps I was just not able to get enough out of the DVD and book.",1394236800,,1337,4.280632411067193
3598494,5,B001GBIOTG,With the help of this video I saw immediate improvement.  I went from taking a break every two laps to swimming 10 laps without stopping after only 4 of the 10 lessons on the video. I'm now swimming over a mile at a time without a break.,1390521600,2,237,4.042553191489362

3598497,5,B001GBIOTG,"I was 38 years old and a co-worker challenged me to participate in a triathlon in the upcoming summer.  I was a biker and runner, but I couldn't swim 25 meters to save my life.  Lessons at the local YMCA didn't help at all.  I found this video on Amazon and decided to give swimming one more try before giving up.  The production value on the video is relatively low.  The instructor, Terry Laughlin, does not look like a world class athlete.  He is, however, a good teacher.  He breaks down the freestyle stroke into single components and gives you drills to practice one step at a time.  Each lesson builds upon the previous one.  As you master one level, you add the next compenent of the freestyle stroke.  Over a period of several months, I followed and practiced the methodical approach layed out in this video.  Following the techniques taught in this video, I was able to complete my first triathlon with about a 1/4 mile open water swim.  I'm now swiming about 3 miles every week, and I still use this video as a reference as I continually try to improve and fine-tune my swim stroke.  One shortcoming of the video is that it does not give much advice or guidance on breathing for freestyle.  Learning to breath while swimming was the biggest obstacle for me, and this video was not much help in that regard.  As for learning the basic mechanics of the freestyle stroker, however, this video was extremely helpful.",1387411200,3,1423,4.547244094488189

You should be aware that it seems Terry has refined his teaching techniques over the years and the drills don't match his Total Immersion book exactly. There may be another video that's a closer match.

Nevertheless, the principles appear to be similar and I've enjoyed the practice.",1382227200,6,551,4.49
3598499,5,B001GBIOTG,"I never had formal swim lessons.  This was a great intro to swimming freestyle for my upcoming Sprint Triathlon.

Highly recommended.",1380067200,3,311,5.098039215686274
3598500,4,B001GBIOTG,"Early this year when I tried to start my swim training for triathlon, I could barely swim more than 25 yards without stop to catch my breath.  By using the techniques described in the book, after 6 months, I now can swim easily 2500m or more comfortably, i.e. without stopping.  So, in short, TI technique did work for me.

However, I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought there were too much details in the book.  Some were not important in my opinion.  I found a bit overwhem and confusion as I was going through the chapters and did not know what to focus on.  After some trials and errors, I found three main things that were critical in helping better my TI swimming skills:

1. Be able to relax, float and kick on you back, both with your hand streamline or touching you thigh position.  It took me about 3 weeks to get this right.
2. When I got the the back float technique, I started the streamline position on my side, both left and right.  I used a pair of short training fins extensively for this drill.  It took me about 3 months to get this right. As I trained for this, I continued to practice my back float and kick drills.
3.  Try to find my balance.  I find this a bit harder as in involved keeping my head down, pressing chest against water and keep my hand extended in the gliding position.  To get this, I just swam 25 yard each time and kept tuning my balance by trying to adjust my stroke, head position, chest.  It took me about 2 months to get this.

After I was comfortable with all three, it took me another month to put them all together.  One day, I was only able to swim about 50 yard.  The next day, it clicked and I swam non-stop for about 500 yard, I've gone further since then.

I trained 2 and 3 times a week and each session lasts about 30-40 minutes.

Oh, you may ask what about the kick.  I do a 2-beat kick but barely.  As you learned the TI technique, you will actually use your hip to rotate more than kicking.  As I rotate my body to breath, I slightly do a 2-beat kick to help with the rotation.  However, most of the force is from your hip.

Hopefully this would help someone who wants to learn how to swim IT freestyles.

3598502,4,B001GBIOTG,"Terry Laughlin presents ""Easy Freestyle"" to all levels of swimmers in this DVD. Part of the Total Immersion system, this DVD is broken down into eight lessons that are relatively easy to grasp if you have any experience in the water, though unlearning past habits can be more difficult than merely watching the DVD and intellectually grasping the material. Laughlin himself stresses the importance of repetition and practice (in some cases years of practice.) While it's suitable for beginners, there are times when absolute beginners (i.e. nonswimmers trying to learn) will be frustrated with some of the terminology used and occasionally with the order the lesson components are presented in. This is, sadly, my situation. I have been essentially a nonswimmer for my entire life, and have recently been taking lessons at a very highly regarded school, and have been making good progress. I bought the DVD to help me visualize correct freestyle techniques better than when I am in the pool with my teacher. I am glad I bought the DVD, but found that it conflicts with other learning methods in certain (mostly minor) ways. Despite this I think it's a very good instructional presentation, and would encourage anyone looking to improve their freestyle swimming techniques to obtain a copy for reference and occasional review. There is a lot of detailed information presented here, so don't expect to simply watch it once through and be done with it; it's a DVD to refer to at intervals to check your progress.",1375574400,6,1509,5.01593625498008

3598506,5,B001GBIOTG,"The first thing you'll notice when you start following these drills is how deceivingly simple it all seems. When you take the exercises to the pool, you will be saying to yourself, ""This is boring and can't possibly help me to swim better"" - but I can assure you, it's amazing how well they *do* work if you take a structured and dedicated approach to following the lessons.

If you want to be convinced, do the following experiment: Take one lesson and spend about 45 minutes diligently working the exercises as described. Make sure and take notes with you as Terry describes subtle things you should be focusing on and feeling while you do them. Don't just mindlessly perform the exercises but instead 'mindfully' pay attention to what you're feeling while you do them. You might do for example 12x25 of the each drill in a lesson. At 4-5 drills per lesson, this may equate to 1200 to 1500 of nothing but drills. Resist the urge to swim any freestyle in between. At the end of the drills, swim some 50's freestyle. I find that I'm faster and swim more effortlessly when I stick with it this way and just do some 50's or 25's at the end of the training session.

I think this is a great progression, but I had to really stick with it and put in the drill time 'mindfully' to make it work. But then it works REALLY well.

3598516,5,B001GBIOTG,"For newcomers to TI swimming (and I'm one), I'd recommend the ""Easy Freestyle"" DVD rather than the ""Perpetual Motion"" DVD for one's introduction to this type of swimming.  Even though ""Easy Freestyle"" was made prior to ""Perpetual Motion"", I feel it was better made.  For example, breathing technique (important, yet tricky) is given more focus and is much better integrated with the overall stroke in ""Easy Freestyle.""  Also, the DVD medium is better put to use in ""Easy Freestyle"" with helpful on-screen graphics and multiple-angle views.  Finally, I think ""Easy Freestyle"" does a better job of pulling together all the techniques from the various drills and helping the newcomer combine these different techniques into an integrated, smooth freestyle stroke.",1328313600,119,760,5.361344537815126

3598518,5,B001GBIOTG,"If you've been working through the Total Immersion book faithfully but need just a bit more help, this DVD is the perfect complement to your swimming. The shots come from many angles for each drill, Terry explains your desired sensory feeling in a voiceover during each clip, and video quality is great.

This video is not designed to stand alone. It is meant to supplement information in the book and to give you thorough visuals for the drills.

Regrettably, there isn't much footage of whole-stroke swimming, nor are the drill names always consistent with those used in the latest edition of the Total Immersion book.

Conclusion: Short of personal coaching, this video combined with the Total Immersion book is your most effective, most economical path to swimming proficiency. Don't have one without the other.",1307923200,4,815,5.067164179104478

At 60, I decided to try again, and this DVD looked interesting.  I find the conceptual approach very helpful - focusing on relaxing, breathing, and becoming confident that I'm not likely to drown.

I am taking it very slowly, but I have absolutely fallen in love with being in the water, and I am building skills and reflexes that will serve me well as I put the pieces together and build up my strength. My husband and I have also been working with a teacher who teaches in a more traditional way, but she has been very supportive of my doing it this way, and has been very impressed with the results.

A side benefit is that the way I am  learning to breathe for swimming is improving my breathing for singing - another passion of mine.",1281484800,8,949,4.488372093023256

3598532,5,B001GBIOTG,"I have six children so teaching them how to swim and be safe in the pool and surf is important.
It is too difficult to get them all into their different age swimming lessons. Time is an issue.
I opted to teach them myself all together- however wanted their technique to be really good which I have never been taught.
These dvds are amazing- already just after the first two lessons I can see such a change in them. I am so relieved that I have the best to give them now. Me (their father) teaching them with these dvds to help is an extra bonus above just puting them in with someone else to learn. I feel like I am doing what a father is supposed to do - share myself and give to them, but with a worldclass professional teaching me how to teach them. The progression in the exersices given are clear and so good. Very well done.

3598533,5,B001GBIOTG,"Terry Laughlin's swimming philosophy is that the swimmers improve most when they improve swimming efficiency.  This video provides the drills needed to improve swimming efficiency.  The first drill is to learn to swim in a straight path with the body in a streamlined relaxed horizontal position.  Subsequent lessons show how to swim in a rotated position (right side down or left side down), and breath while maintaining a straight horizontal position.  He focuses on the recovery and entry phases of the stroke, and the synchronization of body roll with arm entry.  Initially swimming is very slow; ultimately the goal is to increase the stroke rate gradually while always maintaining correct form.  The quality of the videos is excellent, and all drills are clearly displayed.

There are some swimming efficiencies that are not emphasized.  The video does not describe how to achieve a good catch position.  The video also does describe how to time relative movement of both arms to maintain continuous propulsive motion through the water; the drills suggest a rotate to one side, stroke and glide, then rotate to the other side, stroke, and glide method.  This initial swimming style is less efficient, and more difficult for me as it requires a longer time between breaths than a faster more continuous propulsive style of swimming; I expect that as stroke rate increases with a briefer recovery phase, a more continuous propulsive swimming occurs.  A very useful addition would be to give the swimmer clues that a solitary swimmer can use to determine when swimming form is incorrect.

Overall, a great DVD that improved my swimming, and is likely to improve the swimming of most swimmers as well.",1256342400,12,1703,5.086330935251799
