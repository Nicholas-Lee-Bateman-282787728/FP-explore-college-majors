2068522,3,B00028G6SA,"Tajiri & Rhyno v. Coach & Garrison Cade - Rhyno continues to look for a solid partner to team up with. He may have found it here with the Japanese Buzzsaw. Tajiri mists Cade, Rhyno Gores Cade, kick to Coach and it's over.
Winners: Tajiri & Rhyno
Match Rating: 2/5
Chris Jericho v. Batista - Their rivalry continues from a month ago on Raw. Jericho gets the Lionsault but could not pin the animal. Batista gives Y2J the sit-down powerbomb and Jericho rolls under the ropes. Batista pins Jericho and the ref counts to 3. Jericho had his foot on the ropes, but Batista pushed it off before the ref could see.
Winner: Batista
Match Rating: 2.5/5
World Tag Team Championship Match
La Resistance (c) v. Eugene & Ric Flair - Eugene is like a mime. Anything Ric Flair is known for (Old Man Flop, Flail, Wooo, Chops, and the Figure-4), Eugene did in this match. Classic Naitch flailing when he got pissed at Eugene. They had the match pretty much wrapped up, but Eugene pushed the referee down, disqualifying them. Naitch was not pleased after the match.
Winners & still World Tag Team Champions: La Resistance
Match Rating: 4/5 (2 points for the humor)
No Disqualification Match
Matt Hardy v. Kane - With Matt Hardy having an injured knee, I didn't think he would amount to much, but I knew it would not be a squash match. But he pulled out all stops (with help from Lita) to pick up the victory. He hit steel steps that Kane was holding and it hit him in the face.
Winner: Matt Hardy
Match Rating: 1.5/5
Intercontinental Championship Match
Randy Orton (c) v. Edge - Randy Orton is just the best young thing going today. No doubt about it. Randy Orton (for Raw) and Rene Dupree (for Smackdown) are the future of this business. The best thing the WWE has done in a long time is give the Legend Killer the Intercontinental Title. In this match, Edge was looking to take down the Living Legend. And he did just that. He had promised to take down Evolution one-by-one, and he was going to start by taking the Orton-continental Title. He did it, too. Orton had exposed the top turnbuckle earlier in the match, but it proved to be his demise. Edge whipped Orton into the turnbuckle and hit him with a Spear. Orton looked to be crying after the match. Edge doesn't deserve 2 belts within 2 months of just coming back. Orton will win the World Title by the end of the year. You heard it here.
Winner and new Intercontinental Champion: Edge
Match Rating: 5/5
#1 Contender's Match for the Women's Title
Molly Holly v. Victoria - Short match as it should be. Molly just can't beat Victoria.
Winner: Victoria
Match Rating: 1.5/5
World Heavyweight Championship Match
Chris Benoit (c) v. Triple H - Great match. As you expected, the ref goes down and HHH calls for Eugene to come out. Benoit gets HHH in the crossface and taps out, but no ref. Benoit tells Eugene to get the ref, HHH tells him to help him to the ropes. Eugene doesn't know what to do and gets on the apron. Benoit pushes him down, and The Game hits the Pedigree. HHH tells Eugene to get the ref. He does, but Benoit kicks out. The ref goes down again and Eugene takes a chair away from HHH. He doesn't know whether to hit HHH or Benoit. Benoit grabs it and has a tug-of-war with him. HHH gets up, Benoit lets go, and Eugene hits HHH. Ref back up, Benoit gets the cheap pin. HHH looked pissed at Eugene.
Winner and still World Heavyweight Champion: Chris Benoit
Match Rating: 5/5
Overall: Decent PPV. Horrible IC title change. Edge really does not deserve the IC title. Especially taking it from the great Randy Orton. Orton will show why he's a main-eventer. I predict he gets a 1-on-1 World Title shot around Halloween Havoc in October (This will be the new RAW PPV) or Survivor Series. Great humor in the Tag Team Title Match. DVD Extras should include promos leading up to the matches (No DQ, IC, and World Title Matches), Heat match with Venis v. Tomko, and Backstage interviews (Probably Edge, Orton, and Jericho).",1089590400,,3964,4.499306518723994
2068523,4,B00028G6SA,"I was there tonight! Good PPV! Nothing is going to blow you out of your seat, but it's a really soild ppv. Not a bad match on the card...
World Heavyweight Championship
Chris Benoit v. Triple H **** 1/2- GREAT match.. The eugene suspence at the end is great...
Intercontinental Championship
Randy Orton v. Edge ***1/2- repeat of their match on RAW seven weeks prior just with an extra five minutes added. Good back and forth action.. doesn't really pick up until the last 10-15 minutes.. outstanding finish..
No DQ
Kane v. Matt Hardy ***- exciting match. THe only thing I found dissapointing was that they didn't use more weapons.. would've liked to have seen that... other then that though, there's some great spots in this match. Crowd was really into this one.
Tag Team Championship
La Resistance v. Eugene/Ric Flair ** 1/2- good match... HIGHLY entertaining. Eugene and Flair are hillarious. Las Resistance is hillarious reacting to them.. served it's purpose, but not much in the way of a GREAT match.
Batista v. Jericho ***- LOVED this match personally. BY FAR Batista's best showing to date and Jericho really didn't carry him too much. Batista's power is incredible and Jericho was his usual brilliant self. THe powerbomb in the end will blow you out of the water..
Victoria v. Molly *1/2- Typical women's match.. crowd was dead.. not nearly as good as their Wrestlemania encounter..
Rhyno/Tajiri v. Coach/ Cade **- Again, nothing eye popping, but a great opener. All four work the crowd well. Solid showing and soild opening match.
Haven't felt the long term effects of the event yet, but from just what I wathced live tonight, I'll give this a ***1/2 outta give or about a B.. nothing great, but not a bad match.. Triple H-Benoit was the match of the night.",1089504000,3,1767,4.79672131147541
2068524,3,B00028G6SA,"Vengeance 2004 was on ppv this morning and to me it seemed like a very average ppv, nothing real bad or nothing real special. The best match of the night was Randy Orton vs. Edge for the Intercontinental title, it was even better than Benoit vs HHH. There was one match added on Sunday night heat and it was the opener to this ppv, Coach/Garrison Cade vs. Tajiri/Rhyno. This was the second worst ppv of the year behind Judgement Day. Here are all the matches and how I rated them all.
1 star=Awful
2 stars=Not good
3 stars=Average
4 stars=Good
5 stars=Great
Coach/Cade vs. Rhyno/Tajiri-this was actually a pretty okay opener. This match had some pretty good action but not very exciting as I didn't care who won it. Rhyno did a good job and so did Tajiri and probably deserved to win. Rhyno gores the Cade to the outside to leave Tajiri in the ring to pin Coach after a buzaw kick. 3 stars
Batista vs. Chris Jericho-I am a big fan of Y2J but this wasn't one of his best matches. It was slow to start off with but the pace picked up the end when it was nearly over. The most exciting spot was the end when Y2J hit the insuguree and Batista kicked out then Jericho went for the Lion Sault but missed leaving Batista to win with a powerbomb. A good start for Evolution. This was quite a suprise that Batista won. 3 stars
La Resistance vs. Eugene/Ric Flair-This match was for the world tag team titles. The tag team division on both brands but especially Raw are suffering. They need more specialised tag teams not just 2 guys stuck together like Flair and Eugene. La Resistance are the only specialised team now that The Dudley Boyz, Test/Steiner, Jindrak/Cade and Jericho/Christian are all split up or gone. Remember when The Dudley Boyz, Edge and Christian and The Hardey Boyz were in a fued acommpanied by teams like Right to cencor, Too cool and X Pac and Roaddog. Anyway back to this match. This match like the rest of the night was pretty average with some good spots but also some slow paced and boring action. Ric Flair is a ledgend but is too old and Eugene is good for entertainment but not a wrestler. La Resistance are a good combination but need to polish their tag team skills and double teams. The match went for the right length but if there is one thing I can't stand it is punching all through the match. A good example is Benoit/Edge vs. La Resistance at Bad Blood. Atleast there wasn't much of it in this match. 3 stars
Kane vs. Matt Hardy-No Disq -Finally an over average match and a talented wrestler like Matt Hardy is at a ppv. The no disq stipulation of this match really helped it as it had alot of hardcore action. Both men did a great job of keeping the match going without a whole heap of stalling. There was only 2 things wrong with this match, It wasn't long enough and Lita's interference wrecked it. Overall the best match of the night so far. 4 stars
Randy Orton vs. Edge- Sice Edge came back he had been one of my favourite wrestlers and this is his best match since neck surgery. Orton was great aswell and is the future of the WWE. This match stole the show in the end with fast paced action keeping the audience interested and some close near falls. I really thought Orton would win and keep his title for a while yet but I was wrong. The ending was also exellent with Orton trying to hit the R.K.O getting pushed off, Orton jumping a spear, Orton go's for another R.K.O and gets whipped into the turnbuckle then Edge hits a Spear and gets a three count. Brilliant Intercontinental title match up. 5 stars
Molly Holly vs. Victoria-To be honest not much of a match with alot of boring holds and only about 5 minutes long. The womans division needs some high flyers to put more action into some matches. Like usual a bad womans match, the one at Backlash is the only decent one this year. Victoria wins after not being able to execute the willows peak but beating Molly with a high Kick and becoming the number 1 contender probably for Summerslam. 2 stars
Triple H vs. Chris Benoit-I expected alot better from Triple H and Benoit. The match was pretty good until Eugene came to ringside then it got all sloppy . Eugene didn't know who to hit, Benoit or HHH? In the end it was Triple H by mistake. It all started with the ref being knocked down and Triple H tapping to the crossface but Eugene wouldn't get the ref up. Then Benoit went to abuse Eugene and Triple H got up and hit he pedigree. Triple H told Eugene to get the referee and he did. The ref crawled over to Benoit and got a 2 count. Eugene then got a chair and didn't know who to hit. Benoit tried to get the chair off Eugene but Eugene wouldn't let go. Benoit got the chair and took no chances hitting Eugene with it. Eugene got angry and tried to hit Benoit with the chair but missed and hit Triple H. Triple H was pinned and Benoit retained the championship. Overall not the best main event but pretty exciting. 3.5 stars

2068551,4,B00028G6SA,"Hello and welcome to my review on Vengeance 2004. I use a grading system and each match receives a grade. Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- = 0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  = 8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-Garrison Cade & Jonathan""Coach""Coachman Vs Tajiri & Rhyno-This was a good solid opening tag match with Rhyno being Tajiri's mystery partner. The action was good and well balanced with both teams dominating a little bit at a time. I believe all of these men have lots of talent and should be moved up gradually towards better things. My rating 6.28/10.

Match Two-Batista Vs Chris Jericho-Strength of Batista Vs the quickness of Y2J. This match was a very solid match with it doing what it needed too. The crowd was fairly hot for this match and thats a really good sign. The ending was good as it did what it needed too. Hopefully these two have a major feud down the track with some more matches. My rating 7.87/10.

Match Three-World Tag Team Championships-La Resistance(C)Vs ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair & Eugene-Eugene recieved a surprise Ric Flair robe from Evolution and he throughout most of the match did Flairs moves like the Figure 4, the Woooooooooooooo!, the strut and much more. The match itself was very good as La Resistance are coming together a lot since their debut and they seem to do a lot better. Everyone put in a great performance and the ending wasn't great but it had to be done. My rating 8.23/10.

Match Four-No DQ Match-Matt Hardy Vs Kane-This was a good no DQ match with quite a few weapons used with lots of good spots and a nice solid ending. This feud is one of the few long lasting feuds these days so its good. Keep this good feud going as its really interesting and entertaining. My rating 8.01/10.

Match Five-Intercontinental Championship-Randy Orton(C)Vs Edge-This was a really really long match with Edge having all the crowds support behind him and both of these men deserved the time they got for this match and it was only just shorter then the main event which was awesome. I hope this feud continues because its worth it and maybe they could have a cage match or something suitable between these two men. My rating 8.96/10.

Match Six-Number One Contender For The Womens Title-Victoria Vs Molly Holly-This was a good solid womens match. These two bring out the best in each other and hopefully sometime down the track they can battle over the title once again. Keep up the good work. My rating 6.10/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-World Heavyweight Championship-Chris Benoit(C)Vs HHH-This was an awesome match with lots of great action for nearly half an hour which was great! It was non stiop and it was off the hook. Eugene made his way to the ring in this match and it played a vital part in the ending of this match. Finisher attempts,counters,suplexes,flying knees, you name it this match has it. Though there was no blood this match was still excellent and one of the best i've seen in a while. It told a great story as well. Hopefully there's some interesting down the line for both men in the near future! My rating 9.72/10.

Overall this show did very well with a great score in the main event,Intercontinental title match and the tag match was good also. The score for this show is 55.17/70 which is 78.81% which is a B+. This show thouroghly deserved its score as it was really good and it had some really interesting emotional matches. I reccomend this to all.",1121299200,2,4612,4.550548112058466

  Edge is a face at this point in time.  He beats Orton and everybody is happy but then that gives Orton the oppurtiny to face Benoit.  Edge turns heel at Taboo Tuesday.  Orton wins the title as heel, loses it to HHH and becomes face.  Edge wins in a good match.****

2068554,4,B00028G6SA,"I bought this DVD when in came out on sale for $20.  It wasn't worth that.

Cade & Coach v. Tajiri & Rhyno

  Jonathan Coachman called out Tajiri, demanding a Vengeance tag team match.  But he didn't expect the Japanese Buzzsaw to align himself with the Manbeast Rhyno.  The brut force of Rhyno and the martial arts of Tajiri made for a uniquely effective tandem against Coach & Garrison Cade.  And it's hard to decide who got the worst of the Tajiri-Rhyno assault, in the end.  Cade found himself covered in green mist and leveled by a Gore.  But it was Coachman who recieved a jaw-snapping kick that rendered him unconscious for the three-count.

Victoria v. Molly

  With a wicked superkick, Victoria dropped Molly Holly and became the No. 1 contender for Trish Stratus' Women's Championship.  The back-and-forth match took its toll on Victoria, who at one point attempted the Widow's Peak but had her arm give out mid-move.  In the end, it had been a diffucult pay-per-view loss for Molly, who desperatly wanted Vengeance in Hartford after losing her hair to Victoria at Wrestlemania XX.

Kane v. Matt Hardy

  All Matt Hardy's rage, frustration and pent-up emotion overwhelmed the monster Kane at Vengeance.  Hardy once again showed symptoms of snapping in the mere presence of Kane, bashing the big man with TV monitors, chairs and ring steps in the ""No Disqualification"" grudge match.  With Kane hopelessly tangled in the ring ropes, Hardy even used the ring bell to smash the other man who may have impregnated Lita.  After a brutal beating, Kane kicked out of the Twist of Fate then finally gained the upper hand with a chokeslam.  With the match stipulation in mind, Kane gladly grabbed the steel ring steps for use as a weapon.  Seeing events unfold, Lita put everything at risk by stepping between he monster and his prey.  A tormented Kane couldn't bring himself to smash Lita under the circumstances, choosing instead to move her out of harm's way.  But Hardy capitalized, using the combination of a steel chair and the ring steps to crush Kane and bring him down for the three-count.  Watching her boyfriend prevail, Lita showed a rare smile during the most diffucult of times.

Tag Team Championship

  Besides contributing to Triple H's humble defeat, Eugene's uncontrollable ferocity also cost Evolution the World Tag Titles Championship.  Eugene seemed to be having the time of his life emulating his tag partner, the legendary ""Nature Boy"".  He called out in signature Ric Flair fashion.  He delivered knife-edge chops to the members of La Reistance.  He did the strut, dropped the knee and even fell like the 16-time World Heavyweight Champion.  Then, the man himself took over, showing the Tag Team Champions from Quebec what true champion looks like.  But it all vanished before Evolution's eyes when Eugene snapped. After taking a cheap shot outside the ring, Eugene went berserk.  He took out everyone in his path- including the referee, who called for the bell.  With the disqualification, Evolution lost a golden chance at capturing the titles.

Chris Jericho v. Batista

  The mighty Batista delivered Evolution's lone bright moment at Vengeance, but even that result didn't come with without controversy.  In a fateful sequence of events, Batista blocked a Lionsault, hit a punishing Spinebuster and blasted Jericho with the Batista Bomb.  Everyone in Hartford, Conn., assumed the match was over - including the referee, who counted three despite Y2J's leg clearly being on the bottom rope.  It seemed to be an honest mistake as comeback.  Even Batista knew the questionable nature of what occured, swatting Jericho's leg off the rope before its presence could be detected by the official.

Intercontinental Championship

  When Randy Orton bounced gruesomly off an exposed turnbuckle, into Edge's waiting spear and was covered for three, it served as a powerful reminder of just how hard it is to hold onto the Intercontinental Championship in this age of WWE parity.  Edge said that one-by-one, Evolution would fall.  At Vengeance, he picked off a rising star and with it the Intercontinental Championship.  Edge's success has to be attributed to his ability and negate Orton's finishing RKO.  Once, Edge fought out of the move.  Then, he converted it into a backslide that earned a two-count.  Orton was left working Edge's neck, something he did successfully all match long.  But it was the Legend Killer's choice to remove a turnbuckle's padding - perhaps looking for a shortcut to victory - that ultimately proved to be his undoing.  Edge stole away with his new title, leaving Orton to lament his loss in the ring before an unsympathetic crowd in Hartford, Conn.  The charged fans gave Orton a ""Goodbye"" serenade as he left in a manner that foreshadowed Evolution's woes in the World Heavyweight Championship match.

  Evolution sufferd a significant setback at Vengeance - and it has Eugene to blame.  An inadvertent whack with a chair leveled Triple H, who was dazed enough for Chris Benoit to roll him up and retain the World Heavyweight Championship.  The Game thought he had the perfect strategy to return to glory, working over Benoit's chest with a range of creative and crippling maneuvers.  And he seemingly had the ace in the hole: influence over Eugene and his deceptive strength.  Triple H picked his spot, calling for the honorary Evolution member when on the wrong end of a Crippler Crossface and the referee KO'd.  But Eugene's loyalties proved to be so divided that it left him paralyzed-- and a detriment to both competitors.  First, The Rabid Wolverine dropped Eugene to preserve his title.  Later, Triple H pushed Eugene off the ring apron when he got in the way.  The Game's plan first crumbled, then backfired.  With it went his chance to regain the World Heavyweight Championship.",1099785600,5,5870,4.988636363636363
2068579,3,B00028G6SA,"I was very disappointed with this PPV.  It had one good match, but that is it.

1. Coach & Garrison Cade vs. Rhyno & Tajiri

Nothing really happens.  Kind of a boring match.  I actually like Rhyno and Tajiri together, even though a lot of people don't.  (7/10)

2. Chris Jericho vs. Batista

Not the best match.  It was okay, but not that great.  Batista put on some pretty strong moves.  (7/10)

3. La Resistance vs. Eugene & Ric Flair (World Tag Titles)

Pretty good match.  Flair and Eugene worked good together.  Eugene was very funny in the match.  The match was not the best.  (7/10)

4. Kane vs. Matt Hardy (No DQ)

I was very excited with this match, but because of Hardy's knee injury, nothing really happened.  (7/10)

5. Edge vs. Randy Orton (Intercontinental Title)

Great match.  By far the best match of the night, and one of the top 5 of the year in my opinon.  It started slow, but the ending was amazing.  Many near falls and reversals.  Great match.  The two went on the wrestle another classic on RAW a couple of weeks later.  Great match.  (9.5/10)

6. Molly Holly vs. Victoria (#1 Contender Women's Title)

Yawn.  Who cares.  (2/10)

7. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit (World Heavyweight Title)

I was expecting a lot from this match, but it wasn't that great.  I was very disappointed with the finish.  The two went on to wrestle and Iron Man match a couple of weeks later on RAW, which wasn't that good either.  Eugene makes an appearance in the match.  (7.5/10)

I guess you could pick this up, but the only reason was because of the Intercontinental match.  It is worth it for that match.

2068580,4,B00028G6SA,"Another great Pay-Per-View by Raw brand. I think it was really great event and totally worth the money you will spend on this tape. I do give it 4 stars due to some stuff. But heres my review:

1. Johnathan Coachman, Garrison Cade vs. Tajiri, Rhyno

This was a great opener for the night. Some great action by Tajiti and Rhyno. Finally Coach got what he deserved.

4.0 out of 5.0

2. Batista vs. Jericho

A very great wrestling action. I give it a great grade because none of Evolution interfered and it was a great action by both athletes. One of the best matches of the night.

5.0 out of 5.0

3. World Tag Team Championship

La Resistance vs. Eugene, Ric Flair

Wow! This actually became a great match. After La Resistance knocked Eugene off the apron, Eugene got really mad and Rock Bottomed and Stone Cold Stunned La Resistance. But he he got DisQualified. If he didn't , I think they would win the belts!

3.9 out of 5.0

4. No DQ Match

Kane vs. Matt Hardy

Started off by Matt Hardy hitting Kane with a TV Screen, which made it look like a hardcore match start. Though it was one of a few hardcore spots in this match. And it was too short. I give it these stars because Matt won this match.

4.1 out of 5.0

5. Intercontinental Championship

Randy Orton vs. Edge

Finally a real title defence! No Evolution envolved in this match. All I can say is WOW ! Perfect match ! 5 Stars lead !

5.0 out of 5.0

6. No 1. Contenders Match

Victoria vs. Molly Holly

Does not deserve to be before the main event. Should of been after the opener. Not a great match , really lame. You could see these on Raw. They put it up to just add up some time.

1.9 out of 5.0

7. World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H vs. Chris Benoit

Finally a one-on-one match between these two athletes. It was a great match since my favorite wrestler is Triple H. But I wanted to see this match to end one-on-one. But because of Eugene interfering Triple H lost the match. It deserves to be a 5 star match , but because of Eugene i lower it to 4.1 stars.

4.1 out of 5.0

I recommend buying this PPV. Its great PPV with some great matches involved. Great show by Raw. Get it while it lasts!",1096156800,2,2166,4.206812652068127
2068581,4,B00028G6SA,"this ppv is one of raw's best.orton vs edge was one of the best intercontinetal title matches of all time,matt hardy vs kane was awsome but predictable,batista vs y2j was nothing but a stupid filler.world tag team chapionship was okay but flair was awsome in this match,cade and coachman vs tajiri and rhyno another stupid filler. Benoit vs hhh was cool and i guess eugene was only there to shake things up(which he did).overall this was a cool ppv but not as good as smackdown",1095984000,,477,4.623529411764705
2068582,4,B00028G6SA,"Vengeace 2004 was a good ppv instead for the fact that the audience wasn't as into some of the matches as I thought they would. The extras are good, they even have some scenes from raw the next day after Vengeace where Eugene gets beat up. This is still a solid four star ppv and you should definately check it out.

Rhyno and Tajiri vs. Coach and Garrison Cade: A good match for the comedy. Coach and Cade continue to think they are still the shiz-nit, as my friend likes to put it. Both of them get the crap kicked out of them. The kicks Tajiri gives in this match are unbelievably loud. Cade gets the mist in his face and a gore and Coach gets kicked upside the head. A pretty surprisingly decent opener. 7.5/10

Batista vs. Chris Jericho: This was a good match, Jericho should be wreslting for a title but unfortunately is stuck with Batista because he needed an opponent. The ending sucked because Jericho was robbed. 7/10

Eugene and Ric Flair vs. La Resistance: This was a funny match. Eugene has lots of talent and he copied everything Flair did. The crowd's reaction was great in this match, especially when Eugene poked one of the French Guys in the eye. The ending was kinda cheesy, but I didn't really want to see Flair and Eugene as champions. 8/10

Kane vs. Matt Hardy: I was expecting a lot more out of this match, but unfortunately not enough weapons were used in this one. The crowd wanted tables and I was right with them. A chair, steel steps, and a tv monitor were used. It started out fast paced, but then it was just Kane beating on Matt all the time. Lita came down to the ring and kinda ruined it in my opinion, but Matt comes in and hits the steps in his face with a chair. A good match, but way too short and not enough weapons. 7.5/10

Victoria vs. Molly Holly: DUD, this was a rematch from wrestlmania and nowhere near as good as that one. The kick Victoria gives to Molly at the end was loud. Just a card filler, in this one. 6/10

Randy Orton vs. Edge: This was the best match of the night, even though the crowd was chanting boring at some points. The crowd was really behind Edge in this one. Look for a kid in the front row that has a sign that says Edge killer. Its really funny to see his expression when Randy loses. A great suspensful match, and Randy even cries after the match. 9/10

Triple H vs. Chris Benoit: Second best match of the night. I had been waiting to see them one on one since Wrestlmania. Both of them hit each other with suplexes, throwing them into the ring corners, or applying submission holds. The way Eugene helped Benoit to win when he didn't want to was funny, and Benoit continued his streak to five months at Summerslam. Hopefully he will be champion again. The match was good and the crowd was in Benoit's corner the whole time. A good title match. 8.5/10

This was a good Raw ppv, not as good as Backlash or Bad Blood, but still way better than any of the Smackdown ppvs. At least rent it, you all can thank me later.",1092960000,,2983,4.285968028419183
2068583,2,B00028G6SA,"This ppv was ok but the problem was they only have 5 matches if you're not counting the 2 extra ones that shouldn't have been on their in the first place. It wasn't very exciting also because the buildup for the matches couldn't been a little better. If they would have been able to have Shelton Benjamin, Trish and Christian in matches it would have been a better ppv.

Matches

Coach & Garrison Cade VS Rhyno & Tajiri (Winners: Rhyno & Tajiri)

This match would have been better being on Heat. It didn't belong on the ppv at all. It was an okay match though. The only good thing about the match is that it was used to bring Rhyno & Tajiri back as a tag team. After Rhyno gores Garrison, Tajiri kicks Coach's head off and pins him. 5/10

Chris Jericho VS Batista (Winner: Batista)

This match had the worst buildup. All Batista did was clothesline chris jericho in a tag match once to cause this match to happen. The match was good, but the buildup almost made it not worth watching. Batista hits a Sitdown Powerbomb and covers him, then Jericho gets his foot on the ropes but it is not seen by the ref so Batista is able to get the three count. 6/10

Eugene & Ric Flair VS La Resistance- World Tag Team Titles (Winners: La Resistance by DQ)

I liked the idea of this match and thought it could be entertaining but it still had horrible buildup because La Resistance didn't say or do anything and make this more of a grudge match. Only Eugene's taunting of Ric Flair made this worth watching. At the end, Eugene snaps, then attacks La Resistance illegally and gets DQ'ed. 5/10

Matt Hardy VS Kane (Winner: Matt Hardy)

This was the only match that had good buildup at all so it was better than any of the other matches. Matt Hardy won after Lita distracted Kane, then Matt got up from the Chokeslam and nailed him with a chair while he had steel steps in his hand, then got the three count. 6/10

Randy Orton VS Edge- IC Title (Winner: Edge)

This was a good but slow match. It was just too slow to be completely entertaining. But it was still an amazing match. Edge wins the IC title after Randy hits he exposed turnbuckle and then gets Speared and pinned. 8/10

Molly Holly VS Victoria- Women's Title #1 Contender match

This was another match that was was useless to the ppv and not even that good to watch. Victoria wins after a Superkick. 4/10

Chris Benoit VS Triple H- World Heavyweight title

I had been waiting to see Benoit and HHH wrestle since Wrestlemania when Benoit won the title. But it wasn't that special by the time they had it as the main event for Vengeance. I wish they had it at Backlash or something instead of the most retarded rematch of all time the ""Final Encounter"" 3 Way with Shawn Michaels for the title. The match was solid but just didn't fit on this ppv. 7/10

Overall, this ppv is one of the worst of 2004 and it not worth purchasing on DVD. Either they could sell it for at least ten dollars or not even sell it at all. It's about as good as a weekly TNA pay-per-view. Great American Bashwas better.

1. Rhyno and Tajiri vs Cade and Coach. Predictable match but was a solid opener. It was also really nice to see that WWE is finally using Rhyno and Tajiri. 6/10
2. Batista vs Chris Jericho. Many people say that this match was bad but I think it wasn't all that bad. Although i do agree it could have been a lot better. If Jericho could have had a better partner than Batista this could have been one of the better matches o the night. 5.5/10
3. Tag Team Chmpionship. Flair and Eugene vs La Resistance(c). Was a pretty solid match with a comedic performance by both Flair and Eugene. The match was also better because of the fact the Flair and Eugene didn't win the belts. Solid match. 6.5/10
4. Kane vs Matt Hardy. Very good match dispite the awful premise that the match was made on. Also with Matt's knee injury the segment after the match was well done. 7.5/10
5. Intercontental Championship. Randy Orton(c) vs Edge. Match of the night and one of the better matches of the year. Besides the boring chants this match was awesome. Great technical wrestling then the fast paced ending was all great. 10/10
6. #1 Contender for the Women's Championship. Victoria vs molly Holly. Horrible match. But is worth sitting through to see the kick Victoria gives Molly at the end. 4/10
7. World Heavyweight Championship. HHH vs Benoit(c). This match was a mix of great wrestling and stupid storyline involvments. the match was a great one until the involvement of Eugene. The ending was just terrible. It seemed so sketchy and to make it worse the second straight ending of a Heavyweight Championship match with a rollup. Nonetheless the wrestling gives this match a good grade. 9/10.

VENGENCE 2004

1. JONATHAN COACHMAN & GARRISON CADE VS TAJIRI & RHYNO-this match basically came together because of the musical chairs segment on Raw. Tajiri spit the green mist in Coach's face and so this tag match was announced. To be honest t is better than you would think it should be. It was also a decent opener with Tajiri getting the win after nailing Coach with his kick.

2. CHRIS JERICHO VS BATISTA-this was a good match and once again better than most give it credit for. Jericho really made the match I know but Batista did well. The action was back and forth until the end. Batista gets the pin but Y2J had his foot on the ropes.

3.[TAG TEAM TITLE]LA RESISTANCE VS RIC FLAIR & EUGENE-once again a match that was better than you would think it would be. Of course the story here was Evolution baiting Eugene at the time. So Eugene teamed here with one of his favorite wrestlers Ric Flair. Good action throughout the match with Eugene going berserk towards the end and getting himself and Flair DQ'd. I really liked La Resistance in this one for some reason and both teams worked well together.

4.[NO DQ]KANE VS MATT HARDY-this match had a pretty good story line going on as the lead in. Kane had been torturing Matt and Lita, going as far as possibly being the father of Lita's unborn child. Of course Matt was enraged and this DQ match was signed. This was a really good match with a lot of brawling and weapons. There were a lot of spots with Hardy really showing a tougher brawling side and Kane of course using his power. In the Lita gets involved and Matt gets the win.

5.[I-C TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS EDGE-Edge had been gone for  a while but when he returned he wanted a piece of Evolution. In particular he wanted Randy Orton and his I-C title. So they went into this match and what a match it turned into. Both men were able to get in move after move with near fall after near fall. One of the longer matches on the card but well it was deserved as both guys deliver here. In the end Edge takes the title thanks in large part to Randy screwing himself.

6. MOLLY HOLLY VS VICTORIA-this match would put one of my favorites against another one of my favorites. That is right I love both of these girls and they went at it. Of course a shot at the title was on the line. This was a good match between the two with Victoria taking after a kick to Molly's face.

7.[WORLD TITLE]CHRIS BENOIT VS TRIPLE H-Triple H had been wanting the title back ever since Benoit took it from him at Mania. So leading into this he manipulated Eugene and making him go against Benoit and join Evolution. That would come back to haunt him during this match, at the end of course. But before that this was a really good match and best of the night. Triple H dominated for most of the match but Benoit showed his toughness. The crowd was really into this one which added to the match in my opinion. A chair shot from Eugene would cost Triple H  his shot at Benoit, this match was so well done.

8.[BONUS MATCH]VAL VENIS VS TYSON TOMKO-this was a match on Sunday Night Heat leading into the PPV. Tomko had Trish in his corner and all I could think was ""man I miss Trish as a heel"". Honestly I never could stand her as a face but I loved her in bad girl fashion. Nidia was in Val Venis's corner but that ended up meaning nothing in the end. The match was a quick one with Tomko coming out on top, after the match Maven makes an appearance.
