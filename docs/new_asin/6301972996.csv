7818730,2,6301972996,Soooo bad.  I bought it b/c I'm a fan of Patrick Macnee.  See The Avengers.  He was alright but everyone else was awful.,1509235200,,120,4.130434782608695

7818732,5,6301972996,This is a classic!  You can't lose when watching this movie.,1424217600,,60,4.454545454545454
7818733,3,6301972996,"I had not seen this film for years, and I enjoyed it this time around . It's not the best treatment of Poe's work I've ever seen, but is suitably moody, visually beautiful, though it sports lots of bad wigs!  It's a bit slow at the beginning, then builds until the fear becomes nearly palpable. Great cast, most characters pretty much on the edge (or slightly over) of madness out of fear of the plague that is ravaging the countryside. Interesting combination of suspense, horror and eroticism~ good entertainment for the genre.",1423785600,,529,4.75
7818734,5,6301972996,Finally! Am thrilled to get this on dvd finally. A wonderful telling of such a great story. Adrian Paul is awesome in this.,1418083200,,123,4.391304347826087
7818735,4,6301972996,"Just because I like it, it isn't for everyone. If I were going to be harsh, except for Adrian Paul, Patrick Macnee and the fellow that plays Adrian's best friend, this is the worst group of actors EVER!  Even having this made in 1989, there is no excuse for these atrocious actors. Even Adrian as Prospero, seems to be the most depressed human on the planet. One honorable truly horrible nod to the actress playing the female blonde lead....she is remarkably BAD. I seriously hope nothing even resembling a career come for her! Anyway it is a fun little Gothic story and I did enjoy parts when I could just focus on some of the story. It isn't the best adaptation (that goes to the Vincent Price one) but it will be okay for just some harmless viewing.",1417737600,2,752,4.449275362318841
7818736,5,6301972996,this more closely resembles the book. it has the masque and the disease in it. i am now looking towards vincent prices masque,1394064000,,125,4.478260869565218
7818737,3,6301972996,"Adrian Paul is just as Hunky as ever. If you are an Adrian Paul fan, and will forgive a bit of overacting, you may like this version of ""Masque of the Red Death"".

All others should stay away. The acting is either way over the top, or some of the most wooden acting you can imagine. I believe a High School Drama Department could act circles around most of the folks in this production.

If you are looking for a movie so that you don't have to read the story by Poe....go read the story, its great.....besides, this version is only tenuously related to Poe's original work.",1130112000,5,574,4.355140186915888
