3067679,5,B0011NVCAC,"My husband and I are huge fans of WINGS ... and own the Series 1-6 but cannot find Season 7 & 8 which we would like to add to our collection.  The writers are brilliant.  We laugh our way through all the episodes.  Each character is perfectly suited for their roles and a pleasure to watch.  We feel good after watching an episode or more ... relaxing fun and excellent entertainment.  Witty, comical, endearing, delightful, always in good taste.

I especially like the interaction between the brothers and the staff.  Helen, Crystal Bernard, who operates the lunch counter and yearns to play her cello professionally, is hilarious at times and spirited, often precious, but fiesty enough to hold her own with the brothers, who are her two best friends.  They grew up together in charming Nantucket.  Fay's,Rebecca Schull, humor I especially appreciate as she is like many of my friends.  Lowell, Thomas Haden Church, it took me a while to figure out his unusual wit ... but have enjoyed his character as well as the rest of the staff. And Roy, David Schramm, is perfect for his character and cracks me up every episode.  Antonio, Tony Shalhoub, is a charming taxi driver who longs to find a love interest who would appreciate his charm.  Casey, Helen's sister, is a spirited addition who brings spark to the series.

I love Brian's amusing character ... have several friends with Brian's wit and crazy sense of humor ... and Tim Daly, one of the most handsome actors in movieland, is an attractive catch ... a decent, responsible guy with great humor and an eye for sweet Helen, which involves many endearing episodes.

We watch the WINGS DVD's over and over ... never tire of them and each episode is still humerous and facinating no matter how many times we see it ... each episode seems a new esperience.

I like everything I've seen Tim Daly in ... just watched Bereft, which he produced ... but my favorite, other than WINGS, is 'The Outsider', which I own and watch often.  Steven Weber is attractive and talented as well. He did a great job, as a soldier, in 'Hamburger Hill'. I have seen both actors in other movies and appreciated their ability to play a variety of roles.  I am looking forward to seeing Steven in the remake of 'The Shining', which is on my queue. I will be facinated to see him in this horror movie after seeing him in many side-splitting WINGS episodes.

I thank all who worked so hard to produce such a great series of delightful comedy and can only hope they will continue to do others as well. ***** for all episodes.  Wonderful! Highly recommeded.

Now, where can we buy Season 7 and Season 8?",1209081600,9,2627,4.608602150537634
3067680,5,B0011NVCAC,"Most comedies hit their stride in their second season. It usually takes that long to get a good handle on the characters and really get things humming. While Wings was certainly good by Season Two, I personally believe that it wasn't until Season Six that it truly hit its peak.

3067701,5,B0011NVCAC,"This is my absolute favorite season of Wings.  Alex is history and they introduce us to Helen's sister Casey and Antonio is madly in love with her.  The best part about this season is they applied tags at the end of each episode as the credit were rolling.  Oftentimes, the tags were as funny as the rest of the episode.  There are too many great episodes to list but my favorites are: ""The Waxman Cometh"", Lowell sinks his inheritance into a floundering wax museum.  The use of wax figures in this episode was hilarious.

*Lowell is showing the gang The Beverly Hillbillies exhibit*

Lowell: Come listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed.
Brian:  There is no Jed.
Lowell:  The previous owner was quite a gambler and lost Jed in a poker game.
Helen:  Where's Ellie Mae?
Lowell:  Did I also mention that the previous owner was also a widower?

""Is That a Ten Foot Sandwich or Are You Just Glad to See Me?"", The introduction to a running gag of The Big Sandwich. ""All's Fare"" Antonio becomes the driver of a visiting businessman who has his eye on Casey.  Antonio finds out the man has a family and spills the beans to Casey.  A very touching ending.  ""Have I Got a Couple for You"", Joe and Helen meet another couple but become too clingy.  The final two episodes are a story arc involving Joe and Helen's bachelor/bachelorette parties and following wedding.",1383436800,,1355,4.51440329218107

3067712,5,B0011NVCAC,"This was one of the best seasons of Wings. The show had gathered, not lost steam at this time and the cast had jelled nicely with Amy Yasbeck's Kasey fitting in as if she had been there from day one.. The only sadness is in the fact that this was Thomas Haden Church's last full season. Other than that, Great scripts,  nice chemistry between the cast and some really clever and funny moments make this one of the best seasons of Wings. But then again, I like them all.",1251936000,,469,4.269662921348314
3067713,4,B0011NVCAC,"I remember when ""Wings"" first aired, I was disappointed when Farrah Forke left the show. I thought her and Brian's chemistry was great, and it was nice for Helen to have an ally. When Helen's sister arrives in season six, however, she quickly won me over, as a smart, interesting and funny character. (Although I have to admit, I would love to have had both her and Alex along for the ride). As with most sitcoms, after six years, you're bound to have stories that stretch too far at times, but, to me, ""Wings"" in season six is still fresh and entertaining, and it promted me to finish out the set of all eight seasons, which I originally wasn't planning on doing... sorry about that, walet. This was also, unfortunately, the final season of Lowell, as Thomas Hayden Church left to star in his own series. The best part of a show like this is, it's an ensemble piece. All of the characters mesh well with each other, and that makes it enjoyable to watch. Excellent bantor and humorous situations.",1245283200,,996,4.538888888888889

3067718,4,B0011NVCAC,"Great show! Season six imo is probably the best, but hey they all are good, right! But why on earth did they change the way season six was packaged? Have got to say I don't like it. Cheap comes to mind(insert mad face icon here). Anyway if you are a Wings fan this is a must have for your collection.",1219795200,,300,4.016666666666667
3067719,5,B0011NVCAC,"This season is so bittersweet because it marks the beginning of the end of a fantastic series that is still my personal favorite TV show...EVER!!!!

As we all know, on tv as soon as boy gets girl that marks the beginning of the end of their relationship and/or the show.  Wings was no exception.  I truly felt that  Joe and Helen's 'wedding' was the low point of the show and was the most anti-climatic culmination of a wedding from a whirlwind love affair that I'd ever seen.  Since then I've been equally disappointed with Big and Carrie's 'wedding' but that is another review...

Amy Yasbeck's addition was an improvement over Farrah Forke.  She is funny and beautiful and has a nice chemistry with the rest of the cast.  The rest of the cast was stellar as usual and even though I've seen these episodes literally dozens (if not hundreds of times) I still laugh at them.

My kids are now hooked on this wonderful show and they anxiously await the last two seasons.  I'm not sharing my disappointment in what's to come. Perhaps after all of this time seeing them again will give me a different perspective on them.

Afterall, even BAD Wings was still better than most anything on the tube right now.",1215820800,,1202,4.570093457943925
3067720,5,B0011NVCAC,Its a great show to watch again.  The gangs all here and there are lots of laughs.  I really love seeing Tony Shalhoub as Antonio.,1214352000,3,130,4.16
3067721,4,B0011NVCAC,"The sixth season of Wings was undoubtedly its best and the DVDs shos that. However, the quality of the DVD package leaves something to be desired. To save money, the distributors has inserted the DVDs over the episode summaries so that you have to clumsily remove them to read the summaries. Further, there are no extras yet again as in the previous season collections. Finally, visual quality seems murky at best.
Buy this season for the funny, endearing characters and try to forget about the cheapo packaging.",1214352000,7,512,4.896551724137931
3067722,5,B0011NVCAC,"Get set to laugh as the classic sixth season of Wings has arrived from Paramount Home Entertainment.

Set on Nantucket Island, the series followed the exploits of Sandpiper Airlines, a small one plane operation that commutes between the Island and Boston as well as other points of interest.  The airline is owned by Joe Hackett (Timothy Daly), who is a stickler for details and a solid if unexciting individual.

The laughs start to fly when the supporting cast comes into play, as the characters all have a very interesting history.  There is Helen (Crystal Bernard).  an aspiring Cellist who runs the airport lunch counter.  She has been friends with Brian and Joe since childhood but was hampered by her weight which she lost in becoming a very attractive lady.  Then there is Lowell (Thomas Hayden Church), the simple, yet eccentric mechanic, who is a whiz with planes as he is with oddball saying and situations.

 Rounding out the cast are Rebecca Schull as Faye, a former airline hostess who has buried her past three husbands, and who runs the counter at Sandpiper, and Roy Biggins, (David Schramm), who owns a much larger airline chain that competes with Sandpiper

 The season opens with Helen leaving for New York to marry the wealthy Davis Lynch after spending a night with Joe. Joe follows Helen and convinces her to accept his marriage proposal.  Hilarious consequences ensue as the duo plans for their wedding and have to deal with the arrival of Helen's sister Casey (Amy Yasbeck), who has had to abandon her socialite ways after being dumped by her husband.  As the season progresses, we get to see Joe and Helen plan for their wedding, Case and Brian deal with their lot in life, and Antonio (Tony Shalhoub) the cab driver deal with fealings for his Cousins Fiance as well as his desires for Casey which he is unable to utter.
  Some of the best moments include Lowel purchasing a wax museum, Debbie Reynolds and Helen's mom and a psychotic air traffic controller. All of which leads to one of the most humor filled weddings ever filmed
  Never a dull moment, this set will keep you laughing.
While most shows start to fade after their first couple of seasons, this show keeps getting stronger and this is a collection for fans and collectors alike.

3302198,5,B0011NVCAC,"This is my absolute favorite season of Wings.  Alex is history and they introduce us to Helen's sister Casey and Antonio is madly in love with her.  The best part about this season is they applied tags at the end of each episode as the credit were rolling.  Oftentimes, the tags were as funny as the rest of the episode.  There are too many great episodes to list but my favorites are: ""The Waxman Cometh"", Lowell sinks his inheritance into a floundering wax museum.  The use of wax figures in this episode was hilarious.

*Lowell is showing the gang The Beverly Hillbillies exhibit*

Lowell: Come listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed.
Brian:  There is no Jed.
Lowell:  The previous owner was quite a gambler and lost Jed in a poker game.
Helen:  Where's Ellie Mae?
Lowell:  Did I also mention that the previous owner was also a widower?

""Is That a Ten Foot Sandwich or Are You Just Glad to See Me?"", The introduction to a running gag of The Big Sandwich. ""All's Fare"" Antonio becomes the driver of a visiting businessman who has his eye on Casey.  Antonio finds out the man has a family and spills the beans to Casey.  A very touching ending.  ""Have I Got a Couple for You"", Joe and Helen meet another couple but become too clingy.  The final two episodes are a story arc involving Joe and Helen's bachelor/bachelorette parties and following wedding.",1383436800,,1355,4.51440329218107

3302209,5,B0011NVCAC,"This was one of the best seasons of Wings. The show had gathered, not lost steam at this time and the cast had jelled nicely with Amy Yasbeck's Kasey fitting in as if she had been there from day one.. The only sadness is in the fact that this was Thomas Haden Church's last full season. Other than that, Great scripts,  nice chemistry between the cast and some really clever and funny moments make this one of the best seasons of Wings. But then again, I like them all.",1251936000,,469,4.269662921348314
3302210,4,B0011NVCAC,"I remember when ""Wings"" first aired, I was disappointed when Farrah Forke left the show. I thought her and Brian's chemistry was great, and it was nice for Helen to have an ally. When Helen's sister arrives in season six, however, she quickly won me over, as a smart, interesting and funny character. (Although I have to admit, I would love to have had both her and Alex along for the ride). As with most sitcoms, after six years, you're bound to have stories that stretch too far at times, but, to me, ""Wings"" in season six is still fresh and entertaining, and it promted me to finish out the set of all eight seasons, which I originally wasn't planning on doing... sorry about that, walet. This was also, unfortunately, the final season of Lowell, as Thomas Hayden Church left to star in his own series. The best part of a show like this is, it's an ensemble piece. All of the characters mesh well with each other, and that makes it enjoyable to watch. Excellent bantor and humorous situations.",1245283200,,996,4.538888888888889

3302216,5,B0011NVCAC,"This season is so bittersweet because it marks the beginning of the end of a fantastic series that is still my personal favorite TV show...EVER!!!!

As we all know, on tv as soon as boy gets girl that marks the beginning of the end of their relationship and/or the show.  Wings was no exception.  I truly felt that  Joe and Helen's 'wedding' was the low point of the show and was the most anti-climatic culmination of a wedding from a whirlwind love affair that I'd ever seen.  Since then I've been equally disappointed with Big and Carrie's 'wedding' but that is another review...

Amy Yasbeck's addition was an improvement over Farrah Forke.  She is funny and beautiful and has a nice chemistry with the rest of the cast.  The rest of the cast was stellar as usual and even though I've seen these episodes literally dozens (if not hundreds of times) I still laugh at them.

My kids are now hooked on this wonderful show and they anxiously await the last two seasons.  I'm not sharing my disappointment in what's to come. Perhaps after all of this time seeing them again will give me a different perspective on them.

Afterall, even BAD Wings was still better than most anything on the tube right now.",1215820800,,1202,4.570093457943925
3302217,5,B0011NVCAC,Its a great show to watch again.  The gangs all here and there are lots of laughs.  I really love seeing Tony Shalhoub as Antonio.,1214352000,3,130,4.16
3302218,4,B0011NVCAC,"The sixth season of Wings was undoubtedly its best and the DVDs shos that. However, the quality of the DVD package leaves something to be desired. To save money, the distributors has inserted the DVDs over the episode summaries so that you have to clumsily remove them to read the summaries. Further, there are no extras yet again as in the previous season collections. Finally, visual quality seems murky at best.
Buy this season for the funny, endearing characters and try to forget about the cheapo packaging.",1214352000,7,512,4.896551724137931
3302219,5,B0011NVCAC,"Get set to laugh as the classic sixth season of Wings has arrived from Paramount Home Entertainment.

Set on Nantucket Island, the series followed the exploits of Sandpiper Airlines, a small one plane operation that commutes between the Island and Boston as well as other points of interest.  The airline is owned by Joe Hackett (Timothy Daly), who is a stickler for details and a solid if unexciting individual.

The laughs start to fly when the supporting cast comes into play, as the characters all have a very interesting history.  There is Helen (Crystal Bernard).  an aspiring Cellist who runs the airport lunch counter.  She has been friends with Brian and Joe since childhood but was hampered by her weight which she lost in becoming a very attractive lady.  Then there is Lowell (Thomas Hayden Church), the simple, yet eccentric mechanic, who is a whiz with planes as he is with oddball saying and situations.

 Rounding out the cast are Rebecca Schull as Faye, a former airline hostess who has buried her past three husbands, and who runs the counter at Sandpiper, and Roy Biggins, (David Schramm), who owns a much larger airline chain that competes with Sandpiper

 The season opens with Helen leaving for New York to marry the wealthy Davis Lynch after spending a night with Joe. Joe follows Helen and convinces her to accept his marriage proposal.  Hilarious consequences ensue as the duo plans for their wedding and have to deal with the arrival of Helen's sister Casey (Amy Yasbeck), who has had to abandon her socialite ways after being dumped by her husband.  As the season progresses, we get to see Joe and Helen plan for their wedding, Case and Brian deal with their lot in life, and Antonio (Tony Shalhoub) the cab driver deal with fealings for his Cousins Fiance as well as his desires for Casey which he is unable to utter.
  Some of the best moments include Lowel purchasing a wax museum, Debbie Reynolds and Helen's mom and a psychotic air traffic controller. All of which leads to one of the most humor filled weddings ever filmed
  Never a dull moment, this set will keep you laughing.
While most shows start to fade after their first couple of seasons, this show keeps getting stronger and this is a collection for fans and collectors alike.

After her failed marriage Casey moves to Nantucket and lives with Helen. This season is full of hilarious hijinks and antics, including Lowell buying a wax museum, Brian sending a nude photo to Helen's parents, Joe and Helen trying to plan a wedding and even Antonio pursuing Casey. Special guests include Farrah Forke, Debbie Reynolds and Soupy Sales. This is also the final season with Lowell, Tom Church left afterwards because he felt his character wasn't going anywhere. Book your flight for another hilarious season.
