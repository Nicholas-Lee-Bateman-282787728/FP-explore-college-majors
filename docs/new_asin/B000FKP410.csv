8124253,3,B000FKP410,"I'm an Ida Lupino fan, & recently discovered this series.

Between this, Volume 1, & the 2 disc Timeless, there appears to be a total of 17 episodes. There are also is a 32 episode set for that's quite expensive on a label I've never heard of (Home made?) called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Star-Playhouse-Collection-Classic-TV-Shows/dp/B002IS6Z7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Star Playhouse Collection - Classic TV Shows</a>"" but which episodes they are are not listed on Amazon & Alpha (yuch) appears to have 12 episodes on the 3 Alpha DVD's that are not on the ones I own. Most are reasonably good.

As far as this set, it has better picture quality then the Timeless (There is 1 duplication of an episode between the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timeless/dp/B000H30CFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timeless</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vol-1/dp/B000FKP406/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;of this series, A House For Sale.) The last episode does have some wavering in the video, but it's not washed out like the timeless. And Lupino stars in 2 of the 4.

As a previous reviewer stated, ""Let The Chips Fall"" is missing the last 3 minutes or so. It obviously had a surprise ending; but I have no clue what that ending is. If anyone reading this knows the content of the missing 3 minutes, please post. It's obviously a bit of a cliff hanger, & my guess is we are set up for the ""surprise"" missing ending by the entire first 20+ minutes!

As I mentioned in a review of the Timeless 2 disc, it would be nice if Criterion would do a complete series box with some restoration.",1401062400,,1730,5.74609375
8124254,4,B000FKP410,"I just received this, and since I am a fan of classic television, now and then I have some duplicates of a show.  The first program in this, is called, ""Let The Chips Fall,"" which I have in another series.  As it
had been awhile since I watched it, I viewed it here.  Imagine my shock
when it suddenly cut off during dialogue and went straight to the closing
credits a good five minutes BEFORE the ending!  And it is the ENDING which makes the story!  The story doesn't even make sense the way the ending has been cut off.  It is a great story though, and for those interested, it is available on ""100 Classic Television Shows"" DVD series.  The other three programs on this are fine, and are STILL very much worth the money.  For Ida Lupino fans, such as myself, she stars in
two of these!  The other three stories are, ""Looking Glass House,"" ""A Place Full Of Strangers,"" and ""The Case Of Emily Cameron,"" which was also written by Ms. Lupino.  Again, aside from the problem with the first story, this is well worth the price.",1182038400,23,1025,4.347368421052631
