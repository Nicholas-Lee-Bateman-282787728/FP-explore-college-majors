8139233,4,B000HEWGT2,"This is a campy 70's Japanese girl biker gang film. The Red Helmets are four girls in a gang that go to Kyoto during a festival. They shake down people for money, one of the girls is a bit of a nymphomaniac. They take over the girl gang in that city, but must pay homage to the Yakuza, which they don't but infect with the clap.

The film includes cat fights, a passed out nude girl being groped, and a naked girl being beaten with a bamboo broom. Not much in plot. High in 70's camp value. The girls ride Yamaha bikes, although at a distant it looks like they have muscular stunt doubles.

Implied sex.  Nudity, especially if you like tattooed breasts.

8139234,4,B000HEWGT2,"Full of female bikers, gang violence, catfights, over-the-top exploitation and bubblegum grindhouse experience extraordinaire, this entry from cinema auteur Norifumi Suzuki (Amazon - get this man`s name right, would you?) expands on classic ""bad girl"" archetypes similiar to the 'Stray Cat Rock' series from the late 60`s (starring the iconic Meiko Kaji) with explosive abandon and glee. Miki Sugimoto('Terrifying Girls High School') is leader of The Red Helmet Gang, an all-girl biker group who travel to Kyoto amidst a bid to take over the turf of local rival girl gangs there. But it isn`t long before she and her crew run afoul of the local Yakuza, and are then forced to seek the assistance of Pinky Violence icon Reiko Ike ('Sex and Fury','Female Yakuza Tale','Girl Boss Revenge') for help. This 1972 flick from Suzuki ('School Of The Holy Beast','Star Of David:Hunting For Beautiful Girls',etc.) is a classic example of the films constantly plundered by Tarantino - it`s one thing to utilize them in a homage and another to outright rip them off, as he has repeatedly done, but I guess that`s the only way to re-introduce them to an American market that otherwise wouldn`t watch them. If you`re in Quentin`s Choir, you need to check this one out, as well as the others I`ve referenced here.",1268524800,6,1297,5.0092592592592595
8139235,2,B000HEWGT2,"Another Exploitation flick by Pinky violence...this one is nothing new.  The actors are fun, and the plot though contrived and silly is also fun.  There is some entertainment to be found in this film...but it is far from the best Pinky film.",1235952000,,241,4.714285714285714
8139236,5,B000HEWGT2,"Let me start off by saying this films picture looks fantastic visually,along with good audio on dvd. The movie itself was a lot of fun to watch packed with action and sex. I have to say i really liked it but perhaps not for everyone as Japans urban culture is different then anything in the U.S. states in the early 70's . For me this just adds to the viewing experience. I highly reccommend to any fan of old Japanese grindhouse exploitation .",1219968000,6,444,4.36144578313253
8139237,5,B000HEWGT2,"this is a great, great film... exactly like ""the wild one"" (1954) but make it an all-girl motorcycle gang using their sex and fist-fight violence to get what they want... then they split town!",1193356800,2,192,4.676470588235294
8139238,4,B000HEWGT2,"Girl Boss Guerilla is a film from the guy who directed Sex and Fury and stars Reiko and Miki Sugimoto as co-leaders of a Japanese female biker gang. The movie has all the elements of a classic Japanese bad girl film, violence, mischief, a few comedy scenes and sex and nudity. Girl Boss Guerilla may have been an inspiration for the many American bad girl films of the 1980's and 1990's.",1176595200,8,387,4.464788732394366
8139239,5,B000HEWGT2,"This is the perfect film for the jaded film viewer. A delightfully amoral comedy/tradgedy this film combines girl gang violence with sex and even blasphemy. Miki Sugimoto is great as the leader of the red helmet gang combining a tough cool with supermodel good looks. A tale of love, revenge and sisterhood. If your a fan of either Japanese films or exploitation movies you will love this work of mad genius.",1165708800,9,408,4.76056338028169
