2322195,3,B0009UZG00,"The best Five Sandra Bullock Movies... 1- The Blind Side 5 Stars! 2- While You Were Sleeping 5 Stars! 3- Miss Congeniality 4 stars 4- Demolition man 4 stars 5- Speed 4 Stars.  In love and War I would give it 3 stars.  I expected a better ending... The Bachelor, was a bonus movie, I am not a big fan of Chris O'Donnell, but a couple movies are good, Batman Forever 4 stars, and Disney's Three Musketeers 4 stars.  i guess because Chris o'Donell was a supporting actor.  He is kind of a Robin! A side kick, but Batman he ain't!",1367193600,,526,4.178217821782178
2322196,5,B0009UZG00,"A great combination of acting and directing. I didn't expect to find this level of maturity and emphasis on acting skills from Sandra Bullock. No question the combination with Chris O'Donnell was a success and the directing by Richard Attenborough masterful. In my opinion it took his directing to bring out the acting ability of Sandra Bullock that I always felt lay just below the surface. Don't get me wrong, some of her other performances and movies have been great, but they relied on great stories/beauty to be a hit. This one adds great acting as well, and what a combination it makes. I don't quite understand why it hasn't already become a major hit, but I'm quite sure time will justify my rating of 5 stars. For those viewers who have seen other versions of Hemingway's story, this one is so far ahead it's not even funny. The supporting cast is exceptional as is the quality of the production/filming. Lets keep our fingers crossed that more performances like this will be forthcoming.",1068163200,4,997,4.76878612716763

8066810,4,B0009UZG00,"I haven't watched this DVD yet but have seen both movies before. I ordered it for ""In Love & War"" specifically because I loved this movie & never see it offered on TV. Even tho this DVD was used it looks in brand new condition.. No rub marks, scratches, or cracks. Am very pleased with the condition & the quick time in which I received it. I recommend this movie as a wonderful love story, maybe some truth to it as it's about Ernest Hemingway, that takes place during the war. As for "" The Bachelor "", I really do't remember much about it, but I'd probably only give it 2 or 3 stars for content.",1428796800,,597,4.155172413793103
8066811,5,B0009UZG00,I was in a Chris O'Donnell mood after watching Circle of Friends too many times to list.  He is a cutey.  Love and War even though it was good can't compare with Rock Hudson.  The Bachelor was cute also.,1400976000,,203,4.153846153846154
8066812,4,B0009UZG00,"The first one was a surprise for me because is what really happened in Italy and how great Hemingway told us in his Farewell to the Arms. We can watch here how he was as a very young person anxious to be part of quite everything. Really a privilege to know this facts coming from a very close friend. The bachelor is a gift when you are with tons of stress or you are bored. And having this 2 for 1 is something to think about, isn't it? In the both we can picture that all stars are going to have a very great career as it happened.",1400112000,2,533,3.9444444444444446
