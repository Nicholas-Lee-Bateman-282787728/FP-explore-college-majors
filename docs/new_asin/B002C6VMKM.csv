8363272,5,B002C6VMKM,A LION CALLED CHRISTIAN is an amazing documentary. The powerfully moving ending must be seen to be believed. Chistian will always be in my Heart.,1341273600,,145,4.84
8363273,5,B002C6VMKM,"This is a great DVD featuring four great specials. I bought this solely for the ""A Lion Called Christian"" segment, because I enjoyed seeing it on Animal Planet, and Planet Green, and it was the same version that I saw on those shows.

 This is my favorite Christian The Lion DVD......""Christian, the Lion at World's End"" is good, too (plus it's proceeds help to protect Lions in the wild)..but this DVD is more upbeat, and features brand new interviews with Christian's human parents,The men who bought him at Harrod's on that fateful day, the men who Christian hugged in ""The Reunion"" footage,  as well as introducing us to Lisa, the young woman who made ""The Christian Reunion"" a sensation by posting it on YouTube.

 This DVD is worth it, just for the Christian the Lion special, alone. The other specials are good as well.",1280016000,,826,4.708333333333333
8363274,2,B002C6VMKM,"The obvious star of this DVD is the segment titled A Lion Called Christian. However, you should be aware that this is not the full documentary about Christian. That full documentary is found on a DVD titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christian-The-Lion-at-World-s-End/dp/B001EBI3GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christian: The Lion at World's End</a>. The full film runs 95 minutes; the show about Christian here is only 41 minutes, plus it's filled with talking heads and irrelevant silly footage. They have included some scenes from the full documentary, but I can only describe the editing as dishonest: they have used a couple editing tricks to make the scene of the lion Boy hitting Christian seem much longer and more dangerous than it actually was.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christian-The-Lion-at-World-s-End/dp/B001EBI3GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christian: The Lion at World's End</a>&nbsp;has been loved by everyone who's seen it; why did the makers of this DVD feel it necessary to fake things?

Adding to the faults is the fact that the scenes taken from the original film about Christian have been over-enhanced to increase apparent sharpness, but the result is that they are VERY grainy. The full documentary has recently been digitally restored and it looks much better than what's included here.

Also, all the shows on this disc are in widescreen format, but the disc is not designed for widescreen TVs, so if you have one, you'll get the programs ""window boxed""--black bars on all 4 sides.

I love shows about lions, but this DVD is a very cheezy production.",1258070400,4,1672,5.900826446280992
8363275,5,B002C6VMKM,"Love, absolutely love, the ""A Lion Called Christian"" story. Precious footage of Christian the Lion. A must...very heartwarming story. Christian the Lion is definitely one story you'll remember. Get this!",1256342400,,203,5.8
