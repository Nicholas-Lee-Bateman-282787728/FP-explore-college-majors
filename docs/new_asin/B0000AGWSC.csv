1906565,5,B0000AGWSC,"Evan though the last two aren't the best of movies, the first two are classic's and this is a great set to have in your collection, Highly recommended",1102118400,3,150,4.392857142857143
1906566,5,B0000AGWSC,"I can remember the awesome sensation that was Home Alone. I can remeber goind and seeing it theater so many times. All the fans that love the movie as much I as do can all be happy because it's finally out on DVD.
Home Alone tells the story of Kevin McCallister. He's one of the youngest memebers of the McCallister family and he gets a lot of crap put on him. The family is planning on going to Florida for a special Christmas. He is left home by accident. The McCallister neighborhood is being hit by robbers. The robbers know the McCallister's are in Florida and plan on taking the house. Will Kevin be able to stop the thieves or will they rob his house? You'll just have to watch that and find out.
Macaulay Culkin is awesome in the movie. It's one of the best movies he ever did, and for a while he was a house hold name in the early 90's. He did such a good job playing Kevin. After watching it I think half the kids in America wanted to be left Home Alone to see if they could stop bad guys. I know I did.
Joe Pecsi is funny in the movie. I think it's one of the better roles he ever did. He doesn't do a lot of family films. Joe will leave you in tears as you see him and his partner endure the beating they take.
Home Alone is a great family film. It's a great christmas film. Every kid in the world should see this movie. I love this film and am glad it's on DVD in this special eddition. I garuntee your family will love it.",1067990400,4,1436,4.024475524475524

1906583,1,B0000AGWSC,"As the 1 and 2 star reviews have noted, the picture quality is not good. Bizarrely bad as a matter of fact. They display as a widescreen letterboxed picture in a 4:3 frame. No, I'm not kidding. The only way to fill the screen is to use your TV's zoom function. By then the mediocre picture quality is reduced to looking like a video tape.

Can you watch and enjoy the movie because it's awesome? Yes. But you also have a reasonable expectation of presentation and these are just plain sub-standard. I have over 800 titles in my collection and this is the first time I've seen this problem.

I cannot recommend wasting your money on this set.",1483142400,,641,4.423728813559322

1906599,3,B0000AGWSC,"DVDs
This is a box set. There are 2 slim plastic DVD cases with 2 movies in each case.
Home Alones 1 & 2 share a case and Home Alones 3 & 4 share a case.
There is a cardboard box that holds the 2 slim cases.
There are no special features (besides trailers).
Movies 1,2,3 are widescreen, 4 is widescreen on one side and full screen on the other.

Quick Synopsis:
Home Alone 1: Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) was mistakenly left at home while his family goes on Christmas vacation in Paris. It is up to Kevin to try and defend his house with a string of booby traps against two clumsy burglars who are trying to break in and rob the place.
Home Alone 2: This time Kevin makes it to the airport but gets separated from his family and somehow manages to fly to New York City when everyone else is headed for Florida. Kevins luck just keeps getting worse as he happens to run into those blundering burglars, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), in the big city. Will Kevin outwit the Wet Bandits yet again?

Opinion
I would give Home Alone 1 - 4.5 stars, Home Alone 2 - 3.5 stars, and Home Alone 3 & 4 - 2 stars each.
I would have liked the video quality to be a little better on the first 2 movies, they could have been touched up digitally but they appear to be untouched from their original releases.
Extra features are always cool, but this collection did not have any.
I would recommend this set if you can get it cheap. Personally, I would rather get the first 2 on Blu-Ray than these 4 as is.

Thanks for reading my review.  I hope this is helpful to you!",1463011200,3,1570,4.188741721854305

Despite of his current problems/status, he could make a comeback playing grown Kevin (same role) for an upcoming ""Home Alone"" movie or something similar.

They could have just sold one and two and not included three and I would have been happy.  This is a pretty wholesome movie to watch during Christmas Time.  Great movie because it allows children to just use their imaginations to see what it would be like to be home alone for days or wander the streets of New York.  Yes, as an adult, most of the events that occur doesn't seem probable but it is just a great and funny movie to watch.",1450656000,,568,4.118181818181818

The problems don't end there, however. The first film is just a standard release (not the superior Family Fun edition). The others are as well, but I'm not aware of better versions floating around. All films are in a cardboard container with no interesting insert and all DVDs on a single spindle.

As for the actual content - no notable special feature. The first two films are good comedies and enjoyable by all I should say. Only kids would likely enjoy the last two - mine do.

The price is worth it for the first two alone, however, because Macauley Culkin is ever-adorable in these two Christmas classics about the world's cutest little boy, with the world's most unforgivably stupid parents and even dumber criminals.  I love the Christmas-time interior design in their home, which creates a perfect holiday environment for the stories.

My son wanted to watch the last two, but was only really interested in the last 15 minutes or so when all the ""action"" was happening.  Horrible story lines and the actors not that great.

1906828,3,B0000AGWSC,"""Home Alone"" (5 Amazon stars) was a good humorous kid flick and still is, good enough to profit from a sequel, ""Home Alone - 2 Lost in New York"" utilized the same actors playing the same characters. Lost in New York was an amusing tale and worth 4 stars. ""Home Alone 3"" however slipped. The general Chicago setting remained but all the characters changed names and so did the actors, I suspect in part because Macaulay Culkin was a bit too long in the tooth (old). Perhaps #3 would have been more successfully if it had been divorced from #1 and #2 completely with another title and setting? ""Home Alone - Talking Back the House"" was a travesty. The characters, Kevin and the bumbling villain Marv were revived but the new corp of actors took the poorly written story to the pits. So ends the Home Alone franchise.",1415318400,4,814,4.506756756756757

The last two movies are the opposite. It is hard to watch them one time. Never really funny. They should have stopped after the second movie. Dont try to continue a legacy without the same actors, expecially the main character.

1906923,1,B0000AGWSC,"Do yourself justice and skip this boxed set. Yes, at first look it appears legit and a really good deal. But, when you pop in the DVD you'd think that you just bought the set from a bootlegger-- the picture is HORRIBLE! The picture quality must be sub-VHS in quality and is definitely a major disappointment. I bought this set for our annual family Christmas movie night (Where 20+ close family come, dine, and enjoy a Christmas movie) and waited til the last minute to check that the disk would play in my blu-ray player without trouble. Well, it did play without trouble, but the experience was frightening. I just couldn't stomach the thought of shaming ""Home Alone"" by showing it in such poor quality, so I rented the HD version from Amazon and streamed it perfectly via my Roku. Voila! It worked like a charm, so thank you Amazon for having that as an alternative. I'm thankful to God that my family movie night was salvaged! DO NOT BUY THIS SET.

1906929,2,B0000AGWSC,"Great movies, horrible quality.  I understand these are not the remastered versions, and some people don't care about that, but the first 2 movies are actually WORSE than even dvd quality.  Basically, they just took the VHS copy and smacked it onto a dvd.  Pretty complete if you ask me?

Here is an understanding of the quality.  The original picture frame should perfectly fit your HDTV, no black bars on the top or bottom.  The first 2 movies are fullscreen, BUT they included the black bars on the top and bottom of the picture IN the movie.  This means that if you try to make the movie fullscreen, what it will do is basically stretch out the movie horizontally, that's it, because the TV recognizes the black bars as a part of the movie.  So basically, what you get, is your favorite childhood movie watched a the wrong ratio in the horrible stretched out type, quality that goes back to VHS, all for $13 plus shipping!  You're better off looking in the bargain bin, hell, you are even better off streaming it online!  I don't know about you, but I don't like watching my favorite movies through a screen-door of bad quality.",1386806400,,1132,4.5594059405940595

1906932,5,B0000AGWSC,"I have enjoyed Home Alone for several years.  Good plot, good acting and delightful.  I especially liked the meeting of the next door neighbor and Kevin in the church and their discussion of solutions to their problems,  and later when the neighbor rescues Kevin from the Water Bandits.

The sequel located in New York has Kevin in VERY innovative situations that he handles with a lot of finesse.  The way he saves the toy store's big donation from the same bandits is clever, and the scene with the turtle doves is very touching.

All in all, it is good to have the whole set of Home Alone movies together.  Home Alone 3 is one of my favorites.",1386460800,,646,4.47008547008547

1906976,4,B0000AGWSC,"What can I say, complete pretty much sums it up.  This set holds a special place in our hearts, because it was filmed in Winnetka, one of our neighboring communities near our home in Illinois.  We are big fans of anything John Hughes has ever made, and this one is one of our favorites.  The young Macaulay is the perfect character for the part of an overlooked at times because of a large family, yet very grown-up for his age because of his older siblings, young boy.  The home this movie was in, recently was put on the market and sold for a few million dollars.  There was a news article on one of our local channels who interviewed the elderly couple who owned the home and had said the house in the movie was made to look like it had an entrance in the back leading to the basement, which in fact was not an entrance at all.  It was a shed or some other outdoor structure original to the home.  It fascinated to me to learn this.  It looks, for all intents and purposes, like the basement entrance was always there.  But, that's Hollywood for you.....  The movie and it's sequels are like a blast from the past to me.  They bring back many happy memories of when our kids were little and how we used to do things together as a family.  Now everyone, well almost everyone is grown up and on their own.  I know I'm not alone in feeling this way about movies that make you feel warm and fussy like ""Home Alone"".

For that price you really can't beat it. We all know that the only good movies out of the pack is the 1st and 2nd version, but if your buying for a child, it's nice to get the whole series. My niece who is only 3, loved the movies especially when the kid sets up all the traps and the robbers fall for it all. Since it comes as DVDs do not expect the HD effect, either way the movie quality was still good to me.",1357171200,,586,3.9327731092436973

1907001,4,B0000AGWSC,"It's pretty decent. Most people will probably prefer the first two movies. The third one maybe and i have no comment on the 4th one. My nephews didn't like it at all. Maybe other kids will. The quality isn't bad , but it wasn't remastered. Oh well , still worth the price.",1356825600,,272,4.25

I asked for a few more days, hoping the USPS would get thier stuff together, but kingofalldiscounts sent a second set anyway.  the second set made it, still waiting on the first.  So---all my future orders will be with kingofalldiscounts first.  thank you guys!  Wish I could say more.

1907063,3,B0000AGWSC,"I was looking for Home Alone and Home Alone 2 to add to my holiday collection. For the same price as buying the first two movies separately, I was able to buy the 4-pack. The movies come two to a disc and the two cases are super-skinny, so be warned if that matters to you. Nothing else seemed to be a trade for buying the movies together - and four movies for the price of two without any major detractors is a pretty good deal.",1264809600,19,429,4.0588235294117645
1907064,5,B0000AGWSC,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, but it's still hilarious. Home Alone is one of those classic comedies that will manage to make you laugh despite yourself. In fact, I'm surprised at how well it has worn the test of time. The movie is filled with great scenes and impeccable timing, sometimes approaching slapstick routines. The humor is good natured, but doesn't shy away from some curse words. Of course, Macaulay Culkin makes it all possible with his adorable acting and wisecracks (""I'm 10 years old, TV's my life""). Most people have probably already seen the first two Home Alone movies. If you have, I invite you to watch them again whenever you feel nostalgic (especially in light of the fact that Hollywood can't make good comedies anymore). If you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat.",1262390400,2,801,4.728571428571429
1907065,3,B0000AGWSC,"Let's just say I am a huge fan of the works of music legend, John Williams, most notable for the scores of Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, Home Alone, Harry Potter, the list goes on. I also enjoy Christmas as well. The time of good will, family, friends, and giving. Speaking of which, I also received the Home Alone boxed set in my stocking as well as others. This Box set includes all four Home Alone movies in two cases with two movies per case. The original film was released in 1990. It was directed by Chris Columbus, written and produced by the late comic legend John Hughes. It stars Macaulay Culkin as a troubled boy called Kevin McCallister whose family doesn't understand him. After a tiff with the mean older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) stealing Kevin's pizza, he wished for his family to disappear. The wish came true since his family accidentally left him behind while rushing to the airport for a Christmas vacation in Paris. Kevin sees what it is like to be on his own for the first time, especially when a duo of thieves, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern respectively) are robbing homes and the McCallister house is next. Kevin discovers this and sets up comical traps to defend his home and leads to get them arrested in the end. Kevin's mother, Kate (Catherine O'Hara) realized they accidentally left Kevin behind and was determined to find him at all costs, with the help of Gus Polinski (John Candy). On Christmas morning, Kevin's family makes it back and they and Kevin reconcile. The sequel, Lost in New York, picks up where the first left off one year later and almost everyone has returned, with some newcomers. After Buzz plays a payback prank on Kevin for accidentally trashing his room in the first during a Christmas Pageant, Kevin wished to be on his own again. The next morning at the airport, Kevin was duped into hitching the wrong plane and found himself in New York. Kevin borrows his family's money to check into the Plaza Hotel, but the concierge, Mr. Hector (Tim Curry), suspects that the credit card was stolen ans sends his employees to get him. If that's not enough, the Wet Bandits escaped from prison to plan a heist at Duncan's Toy Chest and Kevin hones his trap-setting skills to save the charity money with more violent and clever traps that were still hilarious. Kevin's family finds him again and everyone wins except the Wet Bandits. The first two were just as good as one another, but in slightly different ways. The first has more of a holiday feel to it and the second was a little darker, edgier, and more serious for a Christmas movie, but they are similar. The third tries to bring in a new protagonist, Alex Pruitt (Alex D. Linz) who was left home alone with chicken pox while his mother runs errands, and uses traps and tricks to stop a gang of thieves from getting their hands on a lethal missle microchip hidden in a remote truck that can lead to world domination. When it would feature completely different characters, almost everyone dropped out, especially Culkin. Only John Hughes and Raja Gosnell stayed on. The third wasn't that good, but at least not horrible. It may have provided with a few yutz, but I missed everyone else and it was basically a clone of the first. Then we get to the made-for-T.V. fourth spin-off film and it just flat out sucks. It is when Kevin (Mike Weinberg) visits his father, Pete, and his girlfriend, Natalie, with a smart house that is being targeted by Marv (French Stewart) and his new sidekick (Missi Pyle) and Kevin deals with them once again. The continuity was messed up, the jokes and traps are not funny, everyone was miscast and different, and it was plagued with cheap one-liners like ""House, clean yourself up. Well, at least I tried"", for example. Same story, same climax, what a load of poo-poo platter, and probably the worst Christmas movie since Santa Conquers the Martians and The Star Wars Holiday Special. French Stewart playing as Marv was absurd. When Stern played Marv in the first two, he was a funny doofus with a hilarious scream, but he knew the fourth was gonna blow. With Stewart as the character, he was criminal mastermind instead, and that just ruins the movie for me. When it comes to his other piece of trash sequel, Inspector Gadget 2, I say I'd come to expect that. Get this for the first two, but sell the fourth while you have the chance.",1261785600,,4401,4.6219667943805876

No we don't expect the last two to live up to the first two but with lower expectations we might be in for a great treat. I wish the child stars father hadn't been such a ""stage Mom"" that actually ruined his kids career and life in many ways. Which is why he didn't do the 3rd movie. And while we are at it what kind of father makes his kids sleep on the floor to punish them while he takes their money and the only bed? Today we wish him much success as he's now well into adulthood & himself a father.

1907076,1,B0000AGWSC,"Not to take away from the absolute joy and hilarity I get when I watch these movies, because the movies themselves are terrific.  But seriously, didn't we get ""The Caper Collection"" thrown at us a few years ago?  And aren't those the same versions of the films we get here?  Much to the disappointment of many potential buyers, the answer to both questions is an emphatic YES!  I love these films -- even number 4, which was widely panned -- but enough is enough.  My recommendation would be this:  if you have ""The Caper Collection"" don't buy this, there is nothing new here.  If you don't own any of the movies, either ""The Caper Collection"" or this one will do, if you want all four movies.  Of cours, for the ultimate ""Home Alone"" experience, go with the ""Family Fun"" edition of the first film.",1229904000,36,798,4.493055555555555

However this three star review is based on the fact that it doesn't include the Family Fun Edition of the first film.  If you are buying this thinking that it includes the Family Fun Edition of the first movie, don't waste your time.  This does include the original dvd releases of all 4 films and it is a great deal.  However when I purchased this I assumed since the family fun edition was the most recent edition it would be included IT ISN'T This is simply a rerelease of the previous Home Alone Boxed Set!",1225497600,135,678,4.4
1907078,1,B0000AGWSC,"To anyone thinking that this collection might include newly remastered widescreen versions of the films, it DOES NOT.  Instead, 20th Century Fox has assembled a shameless repackage of the original non-anamorphic discs for films 1 and 2.  The transfers look like they were done during the infancy of standard def, which means quite lousy.  They couldn't even include the recent Family Fun Edition of the first film (which is remastered).  I didn't bother checking films 3 and 4 because it's obvious this is a cash grab for a surplus of the original discs, which have been collected before.  The outside box doesn't even bother to tell you the specs of the films (probably anticipating a reaction like mine).  Nothing new here except the packaging.  Whatever department head gave the green light to this attrocity is in the wrong line of work.",1224720000,210,841,4.921985815602837

I don't regret buying this item at all!  Cody's loved each of the movies and watched them several times... I even still laugh at the wacky situations and had a blast watching them all with him.  They're a fun  series of family movies which I did enjoy!  I just wish that characters had been played by the same actors for all of the movies.",1171756800,,634,4.07258064516129
1907080,5,B0000AGWSC,"I loved these movies. Of course,the fourth kind of sucked,but nonetheless. The film is about a boy named Kevin who is constantly dumped on by his large family. After his family goes on a trip to France,he is left behind by himself. For a while,he has fun,until he has some uninvited guests:two bumbling bandits who clearly don't know who they are messing with. So,Kevin sets a fancy array of traps for the two idiotic bumblers,and the hillariouty ensues as the bandits are caught up in what might be the most difficult heists of their lives. You'll laugh yourself silly. The fun continues in the second and even funnier sequel with Kevin getting lost in New York while his family goes to Florida. Soon,he gets caught up with the two bumbling bandits who this time plan to rob a toy store of the hospital money it's gathering. But Kevin's too clever as he sets more traps that have the bandits slipping and falling all over New York.

1907081,5,B0000AGWSC,"I have always loved all of the movies in the ""Home Alone"" series. I have loved watching them on television around Christmastime every year,but now,i`m 11,and I have a new little brother. One day I saw where ""Home Alone 2:Lost In New York"" was coming on TV,and so I turned it to the channel it was on,having not seen it in a year. I watched the whole movie straight with my brother,and every time I laughed,he laughed! So,I went on Amazon.com wanting to get the complete series on DVD to have forever. Thats when I saw this boxed set. It includes all four of the ""Home Alone"" movies. Here`s what I thought of each of them,and what i`ll always think:

Home Alone-Wonderful Christmas comedy showing the true spirit of Christmas,with some robbers along the way!

Home Alone 2:Lost In New York-An amazing sequal bringing back pretty much all the charectors from the first film. Definately a good one.

Home Alone 3-Different charectors,different actors,but still a great movie. With the villains more smart,and with a very valuble item in his grasp,the new ""Home Alone"" boy is in for a rockin holiday!

Home Alone 4:Taking Back The House-Kevin is back,but with a different person playing his role. This movie is decent,it is worth watching,but isn`t the best out of the four. But,you will still want to buy this boxed set,cause who knows,maybe you`ll like it better than I do!",1133568000,4,1371,4.772151898734177

They were laughing so hard that I bought the entire set so they could see all of them. The first two are the original actors, the third is a different family -- they are cute and funny and worth the money.  The last one uses the original McAllister family and names, but with only 3 children (Kevin again is the youngest), Mom and Dad are divorced and Dad's girlfriend is rich, lives in a computerized smart home and is hosting the royal family for Christmas - it's awful.  The first three make the boxed set worth the money.",1122940800,2,687,4.444444444444445

#1:  Great movie.  Well acted and a simple storyline.

#2:  The perfect sequel.  The original cast returns and gives another great performance.

#3:  A change in the cast lineup.  Plot becomes more complex.  Bad guys are smarter.  Still a great movie.

#4:  What happened?  Though not a bad movie, it completely changes the storyline.

My personal favorite of the series is the third one.  These are great movies, and this boxed set is a really good buy.",1105315200,21,631,4.581818181818182
1907084,1,B0000AGWSC,"Dont get this low rating confused with the movies. I've rated it no stars because it is again another rip off from 20th. Here's why...

This is about the 100th box set of all 4 'Home Alone' films together. And like all of the previous sets, they have ignored the fact that the first 2 movies where the best, the first Home Alone is a 4 or 5 star comedy, and part 2 wasn't as good, but it's still ok. The first 2 where smash hits, and great movies, you might even call them classics. But where poorly misstreated when they where brought to DVD. First off, there in Fullscreen, not Widescreen, they don't look like they have been remastered too good. And there is no bonus features apart from a trailer.

Why is there no bonus features with home alone 1 & 2? There is plenty to put on them, there where heaps of featurettes done when both of the films came out, so where are those now? And why isn't there any reunion footage, or audio commentery or something? The trailer also shows clearly that there is a few deleted scenes and alternate takes or extended scenes... so where is all that stuff? Why is it the only disc with bonus features is part 3 and 4. Part 4 was ok, but no where near as good as the other 2, and part 4, god, don't get me started on how bad that movie was. Yet they fill the 2 useless ones with heaps of bonus features, but cant go find the bonus features you would actualy want to see.

Dont bother buying this box set. Unless you don't care that there are no bonus features, and you just want the movie's themself, then ok, by this. or wait a few months for another box set edition to come out thats just a different cover on the box.

20th century have got to release the first 2 with the much awaited bonus features, other wise, well, there what the French call, Les Incompidont.",1104624000,39,1804,4.220289855072464
