It's horrible.

I only bought it because I was in it (uncredited). One summer day a group of hangers on were lounging at my mostly empty fraternity when a guy ran in the door (Victor Richardson from the brotherhood of Phi Gam) and yelled the words that make every fraternity man's heart skip a beat:

""FREE BEER !""

We were off to the set like a shot which was a defunct frat house a couple doors down at U.S.C.. Much to our dismay upon arrival we were handed warm cans of Milwaukee's Best and told to go stand in the background. When the camera's rolled for the final party scene we were supposed to ""act"" wild.

Ever tell a pack of wolves to ""act"" wild, things get ugly quick. I think we shook the cans and started spraying beer and some got on the camera, or the directors glasses, who knows ? Anyway, amid much swearing we were told to knock it off and they re-blocked the shot.

Having seen the set up I had an idea what was coming and so was able to maneuver between the bearded dude and the older jones in the red dress. Figuring that bare breasts were imminent and there was no way that would end up on the cutting room floor when he mashes the cream pie on her bare chest . . . that's right baby, there's the kid losing his noodle in technicolor (look ma, I made it !). Yellow t-shirt, shorts, sunglasses, hat, yelling myself hoarse and loving every second of it.

Whoever said the movie wasn't released domestically is correct, it was shipped abroad on the heels of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and in 20+ years I had not seen it until I found it here and bought it.

Interesting epilogue; the director who I never knew, and never saw for more than the 15 mins we stood and shot the party scene, I found him on LinkedIn and e-mailed him, he replied and we talked about the movie nearly 25 years afterwards, pretty funny.

So everyone has a story and this is mine, one of many that will answer the question ""So what did you do in college ?"" and where the answer will have very little to do with anything that happened in a classroom.

Aye lads, never let your school get in the way of your education, and I never did.",1286496000,,2144,4.194647201946472
7989553,3,B000095J54,Interesting but funky nostalgia film from the late 80s and early 90s. Famous erotic star Tantala Rey makes a rare cameo appearance. Fun film.,1278288000,,141,4.916666666666667
7989554,5,B000095J54,"I'm a big fan of those forgoten 80's comedys. Assualt of the party nerds is one of the best. It's a barrel of laughs, has a hilarious storyline and plenty of beautiful girls. One of the highlights is watching Michelle Bauer she's one of the hottest actresses around. If you like 80's school comedys this is for you. I give it 5/5.",986947200,,330,4.338709677419355
