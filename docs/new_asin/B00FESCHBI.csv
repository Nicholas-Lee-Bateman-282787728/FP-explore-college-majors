8614979,1,B00FESCHBI,"Item was advertised as having connection with the BBC TV program James Herriott and ""All Creatures Great and Small"".  It is only a DVD of music and scenes that are taken outdoors.  This mislead me to think the ad was correct so I bought it for a gift and now I can not get a response to return this item.  Do not purchase this item.  Betty Jean King",1475539200,,349,4.088235294117647
