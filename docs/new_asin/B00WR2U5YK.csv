8713966,1,B00WR2U5YK,"To keep a long story short, this is a CUT version. Why? I wish I knew...?!?
TV airing in Germany (Bayerischer Rundfunk, 10/6/2004) seemed complete, was lucky to catch it.
(some stills of cut shots can be found on the web)
So I guess this particular release isn't really worthwhile because also PQ doesn't exceed my TV recording.
