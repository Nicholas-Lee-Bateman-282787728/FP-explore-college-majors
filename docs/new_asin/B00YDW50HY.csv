8718202,5,B00YDW50HY,"Camilo Vilas documentary Aurelio: Rebel with a Cause treats its subject with awe and gratefulness over the course of its pithy 40 minutes.  Aurelio de La Vega, one of Cubas greatest composers, resisted convention from his childhood, when he insisted on pursuing a career in music despite his parents protests, to his adulthood, when he lived as a Cuban exile in Germany so he could compose music that breached the artistic dictates under Castros regime.

This documentary chronicles Aurelios life with a narration by Andy Garcia and an extensive interview with Aurelio himself. Musicians, critics, and professors of music examine Aurelios place not only in Cuban music history, but in international classical music history and Cuban culture as a whole. Excerpts of Aurelios work accent the archival footage, dramatic reenactments (incl. a reasonably funny one depicting Aurelios first encounter with Stravinsky), drawings, and photographs that are interspersed throughout the interviews.

The bonus features on this DVD almost match the run time of the documentary itself.  In this DVD, youll find a 20 minute long interview with Aurelio about classical musicabout what makes it such an important and difficult art form, about what makes a great composer, what makes a revolutionary one, and what makes a good listener.  Two performances of his workCanciones Transparentes and Intrata, both performed in Caracas, Venezuela in 2014accompany the interview.

As someone who knows very little about classical music, but who has an open mind and an eager ear, I found this doc to be quite accessible and interesting.  Even if classical music is not your cup of tea, youll appreciate listening to Aurelios blunt humor as he discusses his art, his politics, and his life.",1435622400,,1764,5.2785714285714285
