3686482,5,B001LM64VK,"For years I have been making do with various collections of episodes, with only a poor instrumental theme bearing little resemblance to the original theme song.  Now at last this wonderful show is being released in full season sets with the original opening and closing theme songs. Some reviewers have applauded the presence of the original sponsor messages on these discs. Personally, I don't like them, but the great thing is that you have the choice of playing the episodes with or without the advertising. Some of the difference may be that as Americans, the other reviewers remember the shows that way, with some nostalgia. For me, living in a country where cigarette advertising on television has never been legal, my fond memories are of the version without the ads.

This is a great set of my favourite season of a fantastic show, complete with all the original music , photo gallery and an excellent special feature, ""The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies"". Every episode is packed with laughs; the Hillbillies are still as funny and as wonderful as I remember them from my childhood.

3686483,5,B001LM64VK,"I forgot how innocent was our humor 40+ years ago.
It is still funny, and as clever as ever.
Yes, it has ""stereo-typical things, but we didn't place such guarded care over good clean,honest and silly fun.
We all need to go back to where our words and actions were just ""sticks and stones,"" and trust more in each other.
Wouldn't we be a lot better off if we did?!",1240099200,24,363,4.2
3686484,5,B001LM64VK,"This is the best Quality DVD's I've ever seen.
The Video is razor sharp. Unbelievable.
The Audio has excellent fidelity.
Only 1 problem:
The rediculous, distracting and disturbing laugh track is louder than the dialog in some places. More annoying than usual.
On most new programs the more ""canned-laughs"" they add the less funny the program is.
Suggestion; Make the laugh track on a turn-on or turn-off option in the DVD's main menu.",1239148800,5,434,4.958904109589041
3686485,5,B001LM64VK,What can you say its The Beverly Hillbillies!! Just love them. Want a laugh sit down and watch a few episodes. Great great show!! A show you can sit down and watch with your kids. Unlike other shows on tv now days. A wonderful way to sit down and enjoy your day. Sound and picture is great too.,1238025600,7,294,4.086206896551724
3686486,3,B001LM64VK,"I just picked this up and watched the first couple of episodes. Don't get me wrong; I'm extremely happy that this series is available on DVD; but I thought this is worth mentioning. It does indeed look like these episodes are shown in their entirety, but some of the scenes look like they were not re-mastered.

In the first episode on disk one; ""Jed Becomes A Movie Mogul""; in the scene after Jane Hathaway tells Jed that he now owns the movie studio; as she drives away in her car the picture looks very grainy with numerous scratches. I noticed it again later in the episode; when the Clampetts drive their truck to the studio.

But in all fairness; it doesn't mention on the package that this set was re-mastered

I'll finish watching all the episodes and give more details.....",1236729600,8,782,4.571428571428571
3686487,5,B001LM64VK,So glad to see Season 3 available on DVD.  Season 1 and 2 have been available for awhile on DVD but not as a whole. The sequence of the episodes were mixed up as well has the cohesion.  Maybe we will finally be getting the seasons released little by little ( though they can keep Season 9.  CBS should have ended the series after the average Season 8).  It is funny that the show was a #1 ratings success for the first two seasons but fell out of the top ten for season 3 which had some great episodes.,1231027200,4,502,4.040404040404041

I didn't see it back then.  I have a question The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies was put out by 20th century Fox on VHS release date JAnuary 1, 1998. This VHS tape has a small scene where Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs are singing in the fancy eating room. This isn't on the DVD third season and I'd like to know why. Was the part I mentioned on the CBS special back in 1993? This was right before Buddy Ebsen was singing like Elvis O BAby. I'd like to know if anyone would have this answer.

also quite beautiful, and my husband hasn't failed to notice that (something he wouldn't have noticed as a little boy!).  We also enjoy Miss Jane with her sophisticated intelligence and her compassion for the Clampett family.  Even Mr. Drysdale (as money-hungry as he is) will
drop anything to stop, listen to and assist this wonderful hillbilly family!  Mrs. Drysdale, with her pompous attitude, can be hard to take, but, even she is quite comical, when you actually listen to her words.  Bessie, the chimp, is adorable, as well!

Like many Amazon customers though, we don't understand why only the first four seasons are available, when there were nine made. As neither 'Green Acres' nor 'Petticoat Junction' are available in complete series sets either, I think it might have something to do with the estate of Paul Henning, but if it's a money issue, I'm sure that heaps of each of these three shows would sell in large numbers upon release. Please release further seasons of 'The Beverly Hillbillies' Paramount, and make all three shows as boxed sets AS WELL AS in individual seasons! (To increase our options!). Agree totally with review by co-Amazon customer Charles L. Hall Jr, made EXACTLY 5 years ago!

We all love feisty Granny, whether my father-in-law who served in World War II or my four-year-old grandson. Humor doesn't get much better than Granny fighting the kangaroo that she mistakes for a jackrabbit or Granny as a ballerina! And practical, good-hearted Jed always came through with backwoods wit and wisdom. This was a show that poked good-natured fun at human foibles instead of getting laughs with sex and sarcasm. We're eagerly waiting for the 5th season to be released. The one thing I wasn't so thrilled with was seeing Ellie Mae in a bathing suit so much.",1432598400,2,770,4.976744186046512

Having said that, this is the best season of the b/w years.  I enjoy it when the writers satirize people, places, and events... in the third season Mammoth Studios and Dash Riprock, for instance.  You get those this season.  The 3 or 4 episode story arc about Jed becoming a movie mogul completely tickles my funny bone.  And a few episodes later, the writers satirize beatniks.  I'm sure others have given details regarding each episode, so I shan't here.  (Yes, I said ""shan't"".)

One final thing I would like to comment on are the commercial tags and the final verse of the weekly theme song that promotes the weekly sponsor.  I haven't seen those since the first run, and I really appreciate them.  So, bottom line is if you are reading this, I figure you must be very familiar with the show.  The episodes are complete, with proper theme song, and the picture quality is vey good.  If you are on the borderline of purchasing season 3, I'd recommend you do it.

3686717,5,B001LM64VK,"Since ""Green Acres"" (Season 4), ""Petticoat Junction"" (Season 4) and ""Beverly Hillbillies"" (Season 4) are all stalled, my only conclusion is that somewhere in the Paul Henning Estate, there is a legal fight to 1) not release the subsequent years of these 3-Paul Henning-produced shows or 2) to release, but over the objections of someone in the Paul Henning Estate..........Otherwise, I can see NO reason when many other extremely MARGINAL, INFERIOR and LOUSY TV Series have long-since been released on DVD.

Just wondering when the rest of the Hillbillies series will be out.  One comment..I don't appreciate Granny in her Southern hat on the menu page.  We need to be a little more sensitive to those whose ancestors were subjected to slavery in the south.  I don't really find any prejudice in the episodes, so don't know why that picture was chosen.",1346630400,2,502,4.595505617977528
3686722,5,B001LM64VK,"Sometimes we'll catch a show or two if they happen to be on a cable channel during the weekend, and we've tried one of the several season compilations which were not great transfers and left much to desire. When looking for a real/official season for my wife's birthday I could only find Season 3. I don't if there was an official season 1 or 2 but the 3rd season wasn't a such a bad start, with ""Double-naught-Jethro"" episodes amongst others. You're given a choice of view with sponsors or without, we chose ""with"", and were surprised to see so many cigarette sponsors, but nothing that broke up an episode. A sponsor was mentioned in the very beginning and at the end. But, so much for sponsors. The video and audio quality is excellent, we wish there were more ""Official"" seasons to go along with this one and have no hesitation in recommending this to you, if this is what you're looking for!",1345507200,3,896,4.537037037037037

3686725,5,B001LM64VK,"If you like the Beverly Hillbillies, you'll like this set.  The quality, video and audio, is very good.  Keeping the original music is also a definate plus in my book.  I especially like the inclusion of the original sponsor ads and cast member spots, it just takes me back to when the series first aired. The only way I can think of that this set could be any better, is if it were to include ""bloopers"" or off set interviews with the cast and crew or some filmography of the show in general.  I'm hoping that additional seasons will be released to the public, as if they as good as this one, I'll be in line for any and all of them.",1327017600,3,634,4.172131147540983
3686746,5,B001LM64VK,"The Beverly Hillbillies Official Third Season DVD is yet another wonderful offering by Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD. It has all thirty four episodes of this third season of this funny and terrific show that ran on the CBS TV network from 1962-1971. It also features a documentary called The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies that was released onto home video originally distributed by CBS Fox Home Video, who originally held the video rights to the TV show, as they released select choice episodes onto VHS until CBS and Viacom alongside Paramount took over the video rights from them.

Likewise with Official Second Season, we are treated with the entire third season. The episodes are digitally remastered from original negatives for superb and superior quality. The original theme song, The Ballad of Jed Clampett, is also included with all the episodes and we also have the original sponsorships and cast commercials that were originally with the series during the episodes initial network run. Likewise, you do have the option of watching the episodes with or without the sponsorships and cast commercials, but I prefer to watch the episodes with both the sponsorships and cast commercials for nostalgic and historical purposes as these spots are definitely a part of history.

Likewise, Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD do another wonderful job here on these episodes. The digital remastering makes the episodes of this wonderful show look fresh, clean and new as the day that they were originally shown on the CBS TV network. They also again make mincemeat of all those public domain DVD sets that were released as the DVD boom was taking off.

Likewise, this is another one of the best sets of this classic TV show that has been released on DVD with Official Second Season, MPI's Ultimate Collections Volumes 1 & 2 and it's companion MPI's Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Christmas Collection alongside this.

If anyone from Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD is reading this, why not release the entire Beverly Hillbillies series on DVD? That way, we fans and admirers of this series can really be overjoyed. This is only a suggestion, but again, I still think that the entire series should be released officially on DVD. That would be ""IT"".

Overall, this is another one of the finest collections of The Beverly Hillbillies that nobody who loves this show should be without. This also should be in every fans DVD library.",1326499200,14,2467,5.007317073170731

3686748,4,B001LM64VK,"I love many of the old television shows that were on. They were suggestive but proper, not like television today. The Beverly Hillbillies is a classic show on how to maintain culture even among the non-cultured. Jed and his family create some of the most spectacular circumstances just out of plain ol' simplicity. And it's this simple humor that makes the Hillbillies a timeless classic. I hope the other seasons are released soon.",1303948800,10,432,4.931506849315069

Paul Henning, the creator of the Beverly Hillbillies was a comic genius. The writing was always good, the acting was always good.

8318656,5,B001LM64VK,"This is a truly solid season for the show. In the third season, the Clampetts finally began to settle into their home in the Hills, so they were using telephones and whatnot without making a big deal about it. From this point on, the focus of the humor is on the clash of cultures and values that the Hillbillies are confronted with. This makes room for surreal, goofy material like Jethro's dreams of being a Double Naut Spy, Ellie's Hollywood romance with Dash Riprock, and flings with the Beatnik subculture (even as, in the real world, we were on the cusp of meeting the hippies of Haight Ashbury).Also not to be missed are the occasional commercials for Kelloggs at the ends of many of the shows, featuring cast members eating corn flakes with (usually) blank expressions on their faces. The oddest bit of all is a commercial (if you can call it that) of ""Miss Jane"" staring at the camera in full Hollywood love goddess mode, with wig and makeup. Why? Who knows? But it's all good stuff.",1515456000,,992,4.578651685393258
