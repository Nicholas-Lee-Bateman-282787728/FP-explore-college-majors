1809774,4,B00007GR8M,"I watched this movie only once, when I was about ten years old.  I must admit, I have never forgotten it and it is one of my favourite movies of all time.  I am most disappointed that the DVD is not available; hopefully, it will be eventually...

The story is the typical tale about a Prince enchanted by magic, and only true love will set him free.  The ""twist"" is in the fact that it is not romantic love that does this, but that of true friendship.  Maybe this is why I love it so much...

The acting was okay, and the movie did drag at times, but the singing was wonderful... I still remember the songs... my favourites being ""Have you forgotten me..."", and ""Friendship"".  They may not be the actual titles of the songs, but if you saw the movie, you know to which songs I refer.

Final thought: Wonderful movie; if you ever find it on DVD, watch it! (And then tell me where you got it!!)  ;)",1132963200,6,896,4.192982456140351
1809775,5,B00007GR8M,This is a great movie!  Does anyone know if and when it may be released on DVD??,1123718400,8,80,3.7058823529411766
1809776,5,B00007GR8M,"I havn't seen this movie in almost 10 years. I agree with everyone else who left reviews, and this was my favorite movie when I was growing up. I popped it in the vcr the other day, and I found that I still remember every word, every line. It's a heartwarming story with a good message, and it still makes me cry!",1118707200,7,313,4.064516129032258
1809777,5,B00007GR8M,Please put into DVD format. We no longer have vcr's and we love this movie. It really is a childhood classic! PLEASE CONSIDER!!!!,1112659200,4,129,4.6521739130434785
1809778,5,B00007GR8M,I have not seen this movie in almost ten years and I remember it like it was yesterday. I have been looking everywhere for this movie. It is one of the best fairy tales and learning tools for children of all ages. Adults will love the story line just as much as their children. Aileen Quinn gives a wonderful performance. Hellen Hunt also give a wonderful performance. I did not even realize she was one of the characters until I read some information on this movie. Everyone should have the pleasure of seeing this movie atleast once,1012521600,26,534,4.515463917525773
1809779,4,B00007GR8M,"This is a wonderful video.  It is a musical starring Aileen Quinn (Annie),Helen Hunt (Twister, What Women Want), and John Paragon (Pee Wee's Big Adventure).
  The new princess is to be chosen.  Little Zora (Aileen) is an awkward and backwards girl.  Her sister (Helen) is more graceful and beautiful.
  A frog (a prince in disguise) helps teach Zora how to be a true princess.  The rest? Watch it and find out for yourself.
  It is a great movie.  The ending is kind of predictable, but it's teaches that you should keep your promises.  It also teaches the value of true friendships.
  Highly recommended.",1002585600,28,605,4.747572815533981
1809790,5,B00007GR8M,"Wonderful Family movie with great songs and moral to the story. Would recommend this to any family that wants good clean entertainment. Story about young girl with a ""Frog"" as a friend and how important it is to be true to your values and yourself as a friend.",1236643200,2,260,4.4375
1809791,5,B00007GR8M,This really is one of the best movies of all the Cannon fairy tales.  I own it on video tape and my kids watch it over and over and over...  Plus this is the only other movie that Aileen Quinn (Annie) was ever in.  They really need to put this into region 1 format.,1226188800,3,265,3.8703703703703702
1809792,3,B00007GR8M,This was one of my favourite films that was played on Disney Channel pretty regularly in about '89 or so from when I recall it. It is the best Frog Prince movie made and it's such a shame that I have never been able to get my hands on it. This is one that should be brought back from the dead. It is a great story about a young girl who is the tormented younger sister who befriends a tall frog who is a prince. It stars the girl who was in the original Annie movie musical! There is singing in this film as well from what I recall! Recommended for kids!,1216771200,11,554,3.955357142857143
1809793,5,B00007GR8M,This used to be on TV *all* the time when I was little. It's awesome that i found it here on Amazon !,1215302400,3,101,3.4347826086956523
1809794,5,B00007GR8M,"I agree with the 1st reviewer as a little girl this was the best movie ever, the version we have on tape is wore out I watched it so much! I am 23 and have set out to purchase a dvd copy for myself and my daughter!  I remember how much I loved this particular version of this movie, no other will do!",1208736000,8,300,3.761904761904762
1809795,5,B00007GR8M,Why is there no Region 1 DVD release available? All of the other Cannon Movietales( except for this and Sleeping Beauty) are available. I think it is unfair that the best ones are not available. Please release Region 1 DVD releases of this and Sleeping Beauty. Pretty please!!!,1186358400,26,277,4.791666666666667
1809796,5,B00007GR8M,"This is is one of my favorite of the cannon movie tale series. It has a great moral which is to stand by your friends no matter what especially if they are in trouble. I like the princess character portrayed by the girl from annie. She was alot nicer than the princess in the origioanl story. In that varsion the princess didn't keep her promise to the frog and threw him against the wall and killed him. Thre frof then became a prince. The mean character in this version is helen hunt's character. She became jealous of her younger sister and captured the frog and put him in a deep hole. TRhe good princess whose name is zora was able to rescue her friend and her love for him broke the witche's spell and turned him back in to a prince. Zora was in cometition with her cruel sister to be crowed as a true princess. The princ3e was able to get zora to the ceramony on time and she was crowned. This movie is my favorite besides snow white,beauty and the beast,sleeping beauty,and rumelstiltskin",1170979200,4,996,4.389189189189189
1809797,5,B00007GR8M,"This is an amazing movie about the true value of friendship.  Aileen Quinn's character is the younger of two daughters of a king and she is constantly being bullied by her older sister, played by Helen Hunt, and has very few friends.  Quinn's character meets a human sized frog who instantly befriends her and teachers her the value of true friendship.  It's an amazing movie for the young in age and the young at heart.",1153353600,6,420,4.573333333333333
1809798,5,B00007GR8M,"I love the songs, the setting, and Zora's character.

Zora does all she can to be a true princess. After being mocked by her sister and the court, but receiving no aid from ""Uncle,""  Zora retreats to solitude and the comfort of her lucky golden ball.  Just when it seems life couldn't get any worse, Zora's golden ball sinks to the bottom of a deep fountain. Life seems to be unbearable.

Suddenly a ""too tall frog' (wonderful song there) appears and in exchange for the frog rescuing the ball, she becomes his friend. Through the eyes of the frog, nicknamed ""ribbit"", Zora learns that she is lovable, and begins to gain confidence.

Ribbit promises to help her prepare for an important ceremony that evening which will determine the identiry of the one and only true princess. When morning comes, Ribbit is nowhere to be found.  Zora discovers he is in terrible danger and leaves the palace to look for him-- understanding that she may well forfeit her chance of being the true princess by missing the ceremony. Her Uncle tries to stop her from going to save Ribbit, but she asks him desperately on her way out of the palace: ""I think friends more important, don't you?""

Natually there is a happy ending, life's lessons are learned, and all that. This movie has been a friend for me. I have it memorized completely (including music cues!) and adore it. I still watch it occasionally.",1151884800,,1385,4.651639344262295
1809799,4,B00007GR8M,"When I was probably 5 or 6 my mom taped this movie from tv and it was my favorite.  The basic story is about the younger good sister, on the verge of becoming a young woman, who is overshadowed by her older mean sister, Helen Hunt.  When she meets a very large frog who teaches her how to be a young adult and not a child.  Perfect movie for younger children and even older ones.  I am so glad that I found this movie I have been looking for it for a while.",1142380800,8,457,3.881720430107527

The children are 8,7,5 years old.  I wish that it were on DVD.  They also learned what a VHS was because they had never seen one in their lifetime.  I would recommend this movie for those that have good taste and love good music.",1336435200,4,402,4.1688311688311686

I told her that it was indeed a great movie and neither one of us ever thought we would see it again!!! It was amazing how we both remembered it, yet didn't know how to get our hands on it.  I am shocked that it isn't on DVD.  I reccommend anyone get it even if it never comes on DVD...It's just that worth it.  I mean..I wasn't 10 yet when I watched it and it has stuck with me nearly 20 years!",1266969600,2,555,3.7094017094017095
