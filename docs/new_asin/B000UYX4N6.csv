2927232,2,B000UYX4N6,"I was raised by the adage, ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.""  Hampered as I am by this, I am hellbent on saying only nice things about the documentary, Manufacturing Dissent.  Well (gulp!) here goes:

This release has some rather useful features.  For example, I was able to use its case as a makeshift writing surface when my daughter needed me to initial her reading log for her homework assignment.  I'm sure that the disc itself would make a very nice coaster, once some absorbent surface is attached to the data side.  I've even seen such discs used on the mortarboards of Computer Science graduates during such college ceremonies, so I'm sure for that use it will be quite appropriate.

For members of gun clubs, it could be used for skeet shooting practice.  In such a situation, bulk purchases could no doubt be arranged.  However, it seems rather unlikely that members of the NRA would go against their own kind, much preferring copies of Bowling for Columbine instead.

As far as its entertainment value goes, it could be used for games of fetch with smaller breeds of dogs such as toy poodles and chiuauas.  For such breeds, it would be much more humane than full-sized Frisbees and much more enjoyable all around.  However, it does not fare so well as a chew toy as the shards could be consider hazardous for any breed of canine, much the same way that chicken bones are a no-no for Fido.

If one wished to avail itself of its cinematic virtues, it could be utilized for student sci-fi productions as part of a make-shift UFO.  Just add the two halves of a ping pong ball cut in half, hot glue them to the disc, spray paint the object silver as a futuristic motif, attach a fishing line and voila!  A most fitting prop for any budding Ed Wood devotee.

Regarding the actual filmic content of the work itself, I really can't be bothered to say anything about it at all.  Remember, I was raised to say only nice things so I will have to keep silent on such matters.",1197244800,3,2002,4.516666666666667
2927233,4,B000UYX4N6,"Finally,  someone made a documentary on him...

I remember watching his ""Bowling for Columbine"" and thinking that he twisted information for his own agenda. After watching this I'm sure of it.

I'm happy to say that watching  ""Bowling for Columbine"" was a barrowed copy. Never has that man received a penny from my pocket... Nor will he. To conduct himself in the manner that he does in the name of gathering facts, is at best shameful. His titles and awards should be stripped. Along with being banned from cinematography.

If you are a Moore fan or not this is a must watch.",1196640000,9,576,4.607843137254902
2927234,4,B000UYX4N6,"First off, I am very sympathetic to Michael Moore's ideas. I would love to see more gun control in  the US, the Iraq war come to an end, and health care for everyone. I enjoy his movies for their entertainment value and because they champion causes I believe in. His methods, however, are disturbing. How can you trust anything the guy says knowing the following:  The premise of ""Roger & Me"" was Moore's quest and ultimate failure to get an interview with Roger Smith. Turns out he did interview Roger Smith but decided to cover it up since it didn't make for a compelling movie.

Manufacturing Dissent is a fair documentary. The interviews are with people from both sides. Some love Michael Moore, some hate him. But the important thing is that a lot of the people interviewed worked with Michael Moore. The movie reveals that Moore is not necessarily in search of the truth, just in search of a way to validate things he already believes to be true. This movie is great for anyone who values intellectual honesty.

See Manufacturing Dissent for its content, because its production quality will not impress.",1196121600,22,1109,4.730569948186528
2927235,1,B000UYX4N6,"Michael Moore is not a very good filmmaker. Most of us know that except those that accept his bias as fact and believe wholeheartedly in his persuit of that ""truth"" to all extremes. Don't get me wrong - I'm politically radical but Michael Moore's work is not objective as this ""film"" is not. This is an incredibly hack presentation that displays exactly what is wrong with the onslaught trend of filmmaking that Michael Moore has undoubtedly encouraged.
Most of this ""documentary"" is non-linear and doesn't make or build upon points. It is merely a series of cursory, non-incisive interview clips that are strung together, seemingly at random. I really enjoy watching anti-Michael Moore documentaries in general (FareinHYPE was excellently entertaining) but if this is supposed to be an ""objective criticism"" (is not really neither as no points are made) then perhaps it shouldn't simultaneously be billed as ""Michael Moore doesn't want you to see this"" or things like how incisive it is.
Sure, it's clever to turn the cameras on Michael. Sure, his life has blown up immensely over the last 20 years, but since so many of his pundit enemies employ the same tactics that he does in directing and editing, we are really just treated to the same problems.
This was extremely disappointing. I can only hope that ""Michael Moore Hates America"" is better...",1195689600,5,1350,4.977876106194691
2927236,3,B000UYX4N6,"I think it's a 2 star film, but I give Manufacturing Dissent 3 stars because they used a clip from my film ""This Divided State"" in it.

Other than that, it was ok I guess. I liked ""Michael Moore Hates America"" better.

I'm generally a pro-Moore viewer and I really liked ""SiCKO"", but I don't think ""Bowling For Columbine"" deserved an Oscar. ""Capturing the Friedmans"" was the best documentary that year. But, I digress.

Manufacturing Dissent brought up some good points along the way and I agree with them, it just didn't do it in an engaging way.",1194912000,2,547,4.561224489795919
2927237,2,B000UYX4N6,"I am not a MM fan. I absolutely disagree with his methods. If you are going to edit your ""documentary"" to bend the truth (or outright lie), then don't call it a documentary. Hollywood is showing its true colors by giving him awards in documentary categories.

I don't know if I agree with his politics or not. With all of his lies and extremism, I really don't know what he stands for, other than making money.

As far as this film is concerned, it really only scratches the surface in challenging his films. They would have been better off focusing more on his film inaccuracies. We don't need another documentary (on top of MM Hates America) that focuses on someone not being able to get an interview with him. They didn't even really touch F 911.",1194307200,3,749,4.5
2927238,1,B000UYX4N6,"I find it very ironic that so many documentaries have been made about a DOCUMANTARIAN. Listen, Moore wears his liberal bias on his sleave. He has stated on many occasions that he presents one side of a story, in defense of the other side of stories being told on a daily basis by corporations, politicians, and our very own news media. And speaking of the media, no one thing/person has been attacked more harshly by Moore in his films than the media. I find that very ironic as well, because if you listen to the Bill O'Reilly's and Rush Limbaugh's of the world, our news media has a strong left wing bias.

Look, if you don't like Michael Moore's opinion, fine. But it's not like the other side isn't being represented 24/7.",1194220800,36,726,4.5
2927239,2,B000UYX4N6,"First see all of Michael Moores Documentary's...(including BLOOD IN THE FACE and PETS OR MEAT) - then watch both of Moore's TV show Box sets.
Then watch this.
It will make more sense - since this film is not put together very well...but should be seen simply because someone who has had such an impact on modern film - as MM has - should have their tactics examined.
I think it's important to recognize that, for better or worse - the onslaught of Documentaries in recent years would have never gotten made or released or accepted if it weren't for MM... (including this one).
He made the modern documentary appealing to the average person.
Also: Moore is a comedian - he makes very funny movies about very serious subjects. An overwhelming majority of comedians utilize social commentary in their acts. So why not a documentarist? If you want to look at Moore - you need to keep in mind that his style is directly linked to Will Rogers and Mark Twain. Is he 100% truthful? I'd say I believe undoubtedly that he believes in the points he makes. I would also say he does in editing what an Attorney does when presenting a case. Moore always makes a good case and always makes us laugh. This is something this documentary didn't understand.",1193270400,54,1238,4.581081081081081
2927240,4,B000UYX4N6,"I agree with most of Michael Moore's politics and appreciate that he has helped bring many vital issues into the mainstream. He's done a ton to raise awareness. That said I also think the film ""Manufacturing Dissent"" is fair and has very legitimate criticisms of Moore's tactics. I would hope that Michael Moore would welcome the criticism. Many people will undoubtedly have a strong opinion about this film without watching it just as most conservatives have very strong opinions about Moore without ever having watched his films (Like the previous reviewer ""Bob K"" who thinks this is actually a Michael Moore film). I say it is wiser to keep silent until you can speak intelligently on a subject.

The one thing the film is lacking is context. Moore is popular because the mainstream media feeds off highly polarized simplistic politics. So to talk about Michael Moore with out talking about the mainstream media and its manufactured culture is like making a film about a football player without mentioning the football game.

Watch this film but also watch Michael Moore's films. For all the criticisms, Moore's films are worth watching but with the understanding he sometimes plays tricks to make his point. Even knowing about his tricks I still believe that most his points are valid.",1191628800,99,1289,4.9906976744186045

2927257,4,B000UYX4N6,"This is a well crafted documentary. My rating does not mean that I agree that Moore is an egotistical opportunist, just the opposite. The film is instructive because it shows that even our heroes have feet of clay. That Michael Moore is not as pure as his ardent proponent argue is clear. That he is any less than a dedicated American exposing systemic political and economic problems is false. If you want a mostly balanced view of Michael Moore, this is a good movie. If you are looking for an effective hatchet job that undermines his message, you will be disappointed. So, in sum, I side with the those who laud Michael Moore but admit that it has historic value. Who else speaks for the downtrodden middle and working classes better than Moore as he exposes cultural and economic hypocrisy?

 I have known about Michael Moore for quite a long time now, and many of us know about his showboating schemes just to get mass media attention.  But after watching this documentary I had learned a lot more about the true history of this fraud, and the disgusting hack job manipulated ""so called"" documentaries he creates in order to brainwash regular people.  Even his fellow members of the Far Left have been push aside and abused by this man, who relishes in portraying himself as this poor everyday regular person who feverishly works hard to uncover the so called hidden facts, even pretending that his political opponents (George Bush) had used the Disney Company to censor his messages.

 Michael Moore is nothing short of one of the biggest political hoaxes in modern US history, and the sad reality is so many people still today swear by the Socialism and radical left ""anti-freedom"" policies he endorses.

 Very good detective work had been done here uncovering the total scam Moore perpetrated making and presenting his insanely absurd Far left propaganda hit piece ""Fahrenheit 9-11"", trying to fool huge amounts of people to believe his fairy tales and vote against George Bush.

  Taking the issue of the war in Iraq completely aside, it is one thing to be against or for a political leader's policies, and quite another to manipulate the media and the mass public to believe something that isn't true or be dishonest on how one presented the message.  Moore is a true charlatan of our time, and it is good that at least some people are doing their homework and not swayed by his manipulations and conman scheme.",1432425600,,1703,4.854671280276817

2927306,1,B000UYX4N6,"I saw this film in a cinema and was struck by several things. The first was the paucity of material on which it was based. Sure, the bank giving out guns in it's main lobby was a setup, but so what? The insanity of an organisation (that robs people blind in the first place) giving out guns full stop was given dramatic license, and I thought well done.  It was a dramatic trick of presentation, but the essential message was the point. These folks are just shooting the messenger, and they look soooo cheap doing it.
  There were a few other things, bits of fluff really, but in the main the most interesting thing was, of all things, the musical score. Sitting there in the cinema it seemed to me the music was out of all proportion to what the filmmakers were actually saying. Listen to it sometime without being distracted by the fluffy content. It's very creepy, ALL through the film. It says: 'this man is not to be trusted. Do not trust him. He has lied to you, he is an illusionist', or sentiments to that effect. In other words, the music is out of proportion to what's being said, which is not much, and certainly not worth the film used to say it. It's like a Trojan horse: the feeling from the music is totally out of proportion to the facts articulated. It tries to turn the viewer against him, but doesn't present a compelling enough reason why -I hope you're getting the point at this stage! So one has to wonder where these fools got the money to make it. Ever hear of Cointelpro? Look it up. And I'll leave this review at that.",1280102400,7,1544,4.354166666666667

There's no getting past the reality that the ends justifying the means is the operative principle underlying Moore's work. I caught this documentary on Sundance recently though it's now about two years old. No histrionics or transparent animus at work here. Just a steady-handed evisceration of an ethically-challenged narcissist. The film scores its points effectively through the testimony of former associates--supporters disillusioned and friends betrayed, going all the way back to Moore's being fired at Mother Jones in the early 1980s. There are no right wing bogeymen to aid and comfort the denial crowd, just the likes of publisher Adam Hochschild, labor attorney Guy Saperstein, Nader lieutenant Jim Musselman, film maker Kevin Rafferty, film critic Jack Matthews, writer Christopher Hitchens, Ralph Nader himself, and so on. Definitely worth viewing.",1248220800,5,959,5.530612244897959
2927310,4,B000UYX4N6,"What is interesting about this documentary is that it is made not by conservatives, but by Canadian liberals who largely share Moore's left-wing perspective.  They start out sympathetic to Moore, but, by the end, are finally forced to admit that Moore is a self-aggrandizing liar whose films, while entertaining and well made, are certainly not ""documentaries.""

The filmmakers are clearly not hostile to Moore or his politics.  For example, they point out that Moore was absurdly and unfairly prevented from being admitted to his high school's ""hall of fame.""  And one of their critiques of ""Bowling for Columbine"" was that Moore, instead of calling for a ban on the handguns which are involved in most gun crimes, launched into a convoluted critique of American culture.  Most of the interviewees were left-wing activists who totally share Moore's politics, and worked with him at places like ""Mother Jones.""

So it is all the more damning when they expose Moore's shoddy propaganda.  The film most comprehensively dismantled is the one that made Moore's reputation--1989's ""Roger and Me.""  The whole conceit of the film is that Moore chases GM CEO Roger Smith around with a camera and microphone, but never gets an interview.  In reality, Moore got a 10 minute interview with Smith, the transcript of which still exists, although Moore tried to get his left-wing colleague to deny its existence.  Moore crafted the movie to make it appear that he was alone in his quest to call GM to account, when in reality, there was a huge union and activist movement calling for the same things Moore was calling or.  Moreover, Moore changed around chronology and invented out of whole cloth a story about a stolen news van (and shot a fake local new segment reporting the ""story"").  He also created a scene to make it appear that he had been cut off from speaking at GM shareholder's meeting when, in fact, that never happened.

Then there is ""Bowling for Columbine,"" in which Moore staged a scene in which he receives a gun in return for opening a bank account, making it appear that you could get the gun right there in the bank, when he knew very well that that was not how it worked.  And his ambush of Charlton Heston, who was already suffering from Alzheimers, is aptly decribed by another left-wing activist as ""mean,"" which it certainly was.

Moore is a good and entertaining propagandist, but he is no journalist and he has never made documentary in his life.",1215648000,16,2460,4.837708830548926
2927311,5,B000UYX4N6,"Some other anti-Moore films have fallen short, but Manufacturing Dissent provides a fair and interesting view of Michael Moore's filmmaking tactics.

I first only thought that Fahrenheit 9/11 was Moore's only film with twisted facts and out-of-context imagery, but it seems that's been Moore's process from the very beginning, from Roger & Me on down.

While other reviewers criticize these filmmakers of repeating Moore's own techniques, they did so in attempting to get an interview from Moore that he never granted.  Instead, they were frequently dismissed and even removed from an event on one occasion.

Bottom line: Michael Moore does not make documentaries, nor has he ever.  He makes movies, if only to entertain an audience that he would be lost without.

Give this documentary a try -- while the editing and flow of the film is a little jaunting, the lies it exposes is worth giving it 5 stars.",1210982400,8,904,4.993333333333333

When his closest collaborators are willing to be interviewed saying he twists the facts, and outright lies, I feel vindicated in my suspicions about Michael Moore.  This is a good film telling the other side of the story about the real Michael Moore. I highly recommend it to people who want to know all sides of an issue, and not just the side they agree with.",1210291200,9,840,4.707482993197279
2927313,4,B000UYX4N6,"I just saw ""Manufacturing Dissent"" for the first time, and what I came away with mostly is that most of the arguments intended to discredit Moore are calculatedly specious. At the same time this documentary is claimed by some to be an even handed account of Moore and his methods.

For example, much is made of Moore's manipulativeness. Well, I don't think I've ever known anyone in public life, especially in the political arena, get up to speak before an audience, on camera, without presenting a point of view! Usually just exactly what he thinks his audience wants to hear, which he thinks will gain him the most political mileage.

Moore is trying to present legitimate alternative points of view, which despite their frequently perfect validity, have been systematically ignored, if not derided, by public officials, politicians and journalists, who are supposed to represent the citizenry, but who in fact actually represent money and power, in most cases. Of course he's trying to manipulate us to his point of view, exactly like every other person in public life. You can't demand that every leftist also present his opponent's position! Neocons and other right wingers don't do that! People in journalism, business, industry, the military and every other source of power do the exact, identical thing, albeit in much slicker, better funded ways than Michael Moore ever did.

Take the case against the gun give-away by a bank in Columbine scene, in ""Bowling for Columbine."" He's criticized for having made it appear that they had 500 guns in the vault in the back room, and that they just handed them out over the counter there in the bank; they didn't - they were, apparently, in a warehouse 300 miles away. Well, effectively, that is exactly what they did! Perhaps they used a roundabout, circuitous method of delivering those guns, so that guys like Michael Moore (or any guy with a camcorder) couldn't film it so easily, but it came to exactly the same end. Those guns were in fact delivered to people who opened bank accounts, which is the only point. Sure, perhaps Moore made it happen in a way that was more cinemagenic, a way that made a more compact and tellable story, but the essential truth behind the story, as he told it, is absolutely true.

And sure, Moore understood early on that he was better off using humor if possible to get his message out. How does one get people to listen to ideas that run contrary to what virtually the whole commercial and conventional political establishment wants you to hear? How does one get people to hear words and think thoughts which government and industry have spent billions of dollars on PR and propaganda, over the course of the last 60 years at least, to prevent people from hearing and thinking? It's an established fact that the government spends more on propaganda, aka PR, than every other client of the marketing industry combined (re: Inventing Reality, by Michael Parenti, 1993).

What this film actually showed me is that Michael Moore is in fact a wonderful, highly intelligent and sensitive, mostly ordinary human being, as well as a bold activist, being savagely maligned by those whose vested interests are threatened by his films, ideas and success. Practically every effort to demonize him and assassinate his character falls flat, in MHO. The very cases used to discredit him instead show me a man of practically unimpeachable character, standing practically alone against that juggernaut that is the establishment in this country.

So what if he's not comfortable with his new-found celebrity, power and exposure, and makes a verbal misstep once in a while? Who wouldn't? He's not a slick politician, thank The Goddess and the God. Despite the fact that he's made a little money, only recently that is, he is, unlike any established politician, truly one of us.

If Moore has any serious faults it may be that he is not very politic - perhaps an understatement. But that is also his charm. When one is faced with overwhelming power, as anyone who opposes our big government, big industry, big business, or the military establishment is, one can hardly demand that he hold back! When the president of the United States goes on the air 3+ times a day, repeating the exact same oversimplified, propagandistic message, stating nothing more than that ""the US is Right to be in Iraq,"" for months on end, to justify and promote his unjust, illegal and murderous war to the American public, as I clearly recall him doing, one can hardly ask a man to be meek in opposition. When this nation is absolutely swamped by biased messages from the well entrenched right wing, one can hardly demand that one of the few leftists left willing to call a spade a spade ""present a balanced message.""

So I think this documentary is very telling, though not necessarily in the same way it was intended to be. It was without a doubt a very good experience to have, seeing it that is, my only concern being that it may be possible for some to understand it, that is, to misunderstand it, in the ways it was intended to be understood, which I think would be an unfortunate mistake.

My apology if some think I talk about Moore more than about the film, but to me the two are inextricable, so it's hardly possible for me to discuss the film without referring ultimately to the man.

My star rating humbly reflects my opinion that this is a very well wrought documentary, which subtly attempts to deceive its audience.

2927314,5,B000UYX4N6,"I find it disheartening that so many people have bought into the Moore train. The truth about documentary is the allowance of letting the camera do the talking and giving a birdseye view into a story in order to shed some light and expose TRUTHS.

The thing I found after watching Fahrenheit 9/11, SICKO and MANUFACTURING DISSENT was that... walking away from Fahrenheit 9/11... there were no answers, only questions. How much of the video that was VOICED OVER by Democrat Michael Moore was just stuff made up by a man who hates REPUBLICANS? As time has gone by, I realize now... tons of it. He tells us that our government flew the Bin Laden family out of the country after 9/11 which was absolutely ridiculous. He tells us what BUSH is thinking... yes, what he's thinking as he sits in front of a classroom as he learns what has happened on that terrible day. Apparently BUSH is to be hated because he didn't spring up like SUPERMAN, dawn a cape and run from the building.

He was sued by a Iraq war veteran who's words in the film, were used out of context. Consequently, the case was quietly dealt with and barely reported by the biased media.

This, my friends, IS NOT DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKING... this is sheer PROPAGANDA. Propaganda to change the world to suit Moore's hatred of the Republicans. It's this type of devisivness that destroys America. We're not Dems and Reps... we're Americans.

So, then I watched MANUFACTURING DISSENT, and I quickly remembered what a REAL DOCUMENTARY is. The camera tells the story. Not the DIRECTOR/NARRATOR. The facts are displayed through documents and interviews with people who know the man. Video of the supporters that MOORE stepped on in order to continue his PROPAGANDA mission. The actual time and dates of Moore's DISSENT from Ralph Nader and the REAL DOCUMENTARY filmmakers that he worked with and eventually DUMPED because they weren't PROPAGANDA filmmakers who weren't interested in telling stories/lies like Moore was intent on doing.

No. MANUFACTURING DISSENT doesn't have the big hollywood democratic $$$$ backing their production value like Moore has. The quality isn't HOLLYWOOD funded looking... but, the real thing that MANUFACTURING DISSENT has over anything Michael Moore decides to do is an AIR OF TRUTH.

You don't walk away from MANUFACTURING DISSENT wondering what was truth and what was made up by the creators. What you see is what you get. The truth. No speculation.",1202860800,9,2435,4.912408759124087

The film also suggest Moore has no problem  surprising people he wants to film with unscheduled meetings, but apparently does not like the technique used on himself; again, the film give excellent examples.
 The well read, well educated friends I have asked about Moore's films were not aware of his reputation of manipulating scenes. They took his documentaries as being just that, straight honest documentaries: not satires. I do not think my friends are unique.

2927317,2,B000UYX4N6,"I completely get that many people do not like the viewpoints of Michael Moore and disagree with his political views, but the amount of backlash against him seems so petty and weak that it quickly loses credibility. No more is that on display than in the film Manufacturing Dissent.

As far as I can tell a Toronto-based documentarian couldn't get an interview with Moore. And somehow that seems to motivate the entire focus of this documentary as the filmmakers show numerous situations that only seem bad if you feel Moore has to stop, drop and roll everytime a news crew wants to speak with him. Newsflash, he doesn't.

Therefore all you are left with is a lot of whinning from people who basically don't like Moore but can't come up with anything substantive enough to make you understand why their opinion matters. No more is that situation highlighted than in the embarrassing interview David Gilmour gives, basically this former movie critic tries to build a case that an interview with Moore shows the filmmaker seething with anger and hostility, but the interview itself actually shows nothing of the sort when shown. Gilmour actually comes across as the angry narcissist he accusses Moore of being.

There are some interesting viewpoints expressed and revelations about Moore's work that are quite valid (he, it turns out did speak with the Roger, in Roger & Me). But one thing the film comes nowhere close to asking is is Micheal Moore really a bad guy for simply editing his films to be more effective in making their points? In Manufacturing Dissent I heard no opinion that challenged the central premises of each Moore film and no real reasoning that makes you think Moore's practises are truly that bad.

But what I did get was a lot people, for whatever reason, are quite angry with Moore, probably because he's one of the few successful documentarians to actually get his films viewed by a wide audience. Otherwise, instead of calling this film Manufacturing Dissent it should be called Reaching For An Arguement.",1200787200,12,2029,4.872463768115942

2927319,4,B000UYX4N6,"It took awhile but Manufacturing Dissent eventually won me over. Ms. Melnyk illuminated a great many facts which Mr. Moore undoubtedly wishes remained hidden. First and foremost was the one regarding his place of origin. Moore, contrary to his claims, was not raised in working class Flint, but instead in middle class Davison, Michigan. Many other tidbits such as this one he certainly wishes remained suppressed. Fans regard him as being a regular guy who is approachable, but he is not. In fact, such a demeanor is the farthest thing from the truth. Moore is a smug, self-righteous radical who looks down on everybody else just as others of his kind do. This is highly evident in the context of the film as he refused to be interviewed by the director or even to talk to her privately--despite his initially giving his consent during a brief segment they recorded. His disdain for the low budget film director was so great that he actually had his security throw her and her crew out of his speaking events...continually. They were barred and tossed despite his claim of ""liking Canadians.""

Despite notable signs of slant--such as showing clips of battle in Iraq with a song playing lyrics like ""another soldier dying""-- Debbie Melnyk does not do the standard leftist thing of completely ignoring her opposition. She interviews Moore's detractors and lets them speak clearly which is something that won my respect. Moore's megalomania is discernible in many ways as seen in the way that he refused to pay a music critic whose work he printed in The Flint Voice. The same thing can be said of the way he treated his coworkers at Mother Jones. Ultimately, Melnyk is honest enough to let the situation describe itself. Michael Moore, the supposed champion of the common person, is far above the masses and is too superior to allow the documentary crew to interact with him.

I admire Moore and didn't like the slant this film took against him.",1520380800,,720,4.677165354330708

8215783,1,B000UYX4N6,"I learned virtually nothing of significance in this film. A personality is of interest and worthy of paying attention if he or she makes some contribution to the public. The film concentrates on the person of Michael Moore but not the issues he stands for. Who cares if he gets $8,000 more than the original settlement offered to him by Mother Jones when he was fired from the magazine? The title 'Manufacturing Dissent' apparently draws the similarity with 'Manufacturing Consent'. The latter was a faithful depiction of the state of the mainstream media. But the dissent in the country does not come close to being made up, certainly not by Moore. The huge opposition to the Iraq war before it started around the world was a living proof that the dissent was not made up by a small number of the elite class. It is easily understandable from the moral point of view. It's really amazing that people can be so bad at making judgment.",1514246400,,934,4.666666666666667
8215784,4,B000UYX4N6,"I remember Mr. Moore being on Donahue & was intrigued by him then. I have seen several of his projects & remember his show TV Nation.
Sadly I forget why TV Nation went off the air, but I do recall talk shows being preempted & news shows oddly having technical issues.
But as I watched this I was shocked to see people being escorted out of a political rally as Mr. Moore seemed to mocked them.
I now see where Mr. Trump could of copied his ridicule of Americans from & I see the fake comments have spread.
Is it possible Trump is profiting from what Mr. Moore started, nightmare scenario.",1513209600,2,588,4.306306306306307

It's not technically illegal to do this. (Not since 1996 anyway.) But it definitely is not a ""documentary"" by genre. More of an essay that journals no events and documents no evidence.",1508284800,5,341,5.452830188679245
