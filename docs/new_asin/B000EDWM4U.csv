2516770,5,B000EDWM4U,"i bought the 2 dvds together and i can't stop watching them!!  i really wish that A&E would put the rest of the episodes from seasons 1 & 2 on collection dvds...instead of buying each episode @ $12.99 per show!!  A&E are you reading this???  but, yes, this dvd collection is very good, it's like watching COPS...and one of my fave ones is where Dog tricks the guy into thinking he won a free vacuum and the guy gives him his REAL address!!!  I think it's on season 2 under 'baby lyssa' episode...great set!!  can't wait for season 3!!",1148860800,6,534,4.353535353535354

8108575,3,B000EDWM4U,"This is really nothing but a glorified version of COPS.  I happen to be a Cops fan, so I don't mind watching this series now and then, but Dog gets old real fast.  His face looks like he shaves with a cheese grater (too many cigs and the like), his wife dresses like a ho (at Dog's insistence), and the rest of them, well, they're the usual combo of ""kick a**"" types who love screaming ""get on the ground!  Get on the ground!"".  Dog can be quite naive and sanctimonious (putting everything in terms of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", even though he was once a ""bad guy"" himself), and sometimes his praying/born again schtick feels like it's done for the cameras and nothing else.  The main thing here that perhaps Dog doesn't realise he's doing is exposing Hawaii.  Dog lives in Hawaii, and all of his ""clients"" are there for him to round up.  Hawaii has this reputation of being a paradise, but that's just the resorts themselves.  Surrounding them you have immense poverty and crime in Hawaii.  It's almost along the lines of other island ""paradises"" like Jamacia and Fiji, where the resorts are dreamy, but there's a ghetto surrounding it.  Thanks to Dog for pointing this out, although inadvernently.  You're probably better off seeing reruns of Dog on A & E than buying these discs...",1176854400,,1285,4.592105263157895
8108576,5,B000EDWM4U,I loved the two DVDs and I am glad I got season one and two in a package deal.  Well worth the savings to buy both.,1173657600,,115,3.423076923076923
8108577,5,B000EDWM4U,"I remember the first time the show came on. I was watching A&E -- what I had always thought of as a kind of sedate channel -- and all of a sudden this Ozzy Osbourne riff comes on and next thing I know, there's Dog -- he's so charismatic and his family was so fantastic -- I found myself intrigued and sat and watched for the entire show -- and have been a fan of the show ever since.

It's hard to define what it is exactly that I love about it, there are so many aspects, actually. I don't want to give away details about the episodes because you really have to watch them for yourself, but the main characters, Dog, Beth, Tim, Leland, Duane Lee -- what a great family.

Most importantly, they're not just 'bounty hunting' -- they're finding these criminals and they're making a difference in these people's lives, people who otherwise would be so lost, people who sort of fall through the cracks of a system that makes it really difficult for them to straighten up. Dog and his family really take the time with each capture and show them something they probably don't get much of: Love.

It really is an amazing thing to watch.

I also think this is a great series to share with teens, one that teachers might want to share with at risk students, most definitely.",1171411200,,1265,4.3474576271186445
8108578,5,B000EDWM4U,"i really like this show.  i watch it everytime it is on television.  i purchased the dvd and was surprised to see that they have fights that they do not show on television.  my favorite part about the show is when they pray.  also, i like how dog uses biblical principles to lead his family personally and professionally.  they keep God first and that's how it should be.",1169164800,,371,4.397058823529412
8108579,5,B000EDWM4U,a rip roaring good time. nothing like seeing dog slam someone against a car.,1168905600,,76,4.5
8108580,5,B000EDWM4U,"If you are a ""Dog"" fan, this is a must have. It is much nicer to watch the shows with out the 5-7 minute comercial breaks. God bless the Dog!",1167782400,,141,3.7333333333333334
8108581,5,B000EDWM4U,"I am very happy that I bought Dog The Bounty Hunter Seasons 1 and 2!! I must have watched them each 10 times in a row before I could stop! I think Dog and his team are the greatest, and I enjoy watching every new and old episode that airs. I can't wait until the next season is on DVD. If you love watching Dog, this is a very recommended buy!! You won't be let down!!",1167782400,,368,3.8552631578947367
8108582,5,B000EDWM4U,"Dog the Bounty Hunter is such a great show.  The best of Season 1 and 2 are a great collection.  Although not all the episodes are included, it is still a great collection for people who love the show.",1163462400,,201,4.128205128205129
