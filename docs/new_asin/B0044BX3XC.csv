8416061,5,B0044BX3XC,I am a pro guitarist and learned a lot from this set. I really wish I had it back when I was a beginner as I would be so much better now. John is a fantastic teacher!,1515283200,,166,3.5135135135135136
8416062,5,B0044BX3XC,"This is a follow on to the author's previous 2 CD set ""Introduction to Chord Theory and Voicing.""  Get that one first.  The first 2 CD's cover major, minor, and seventh chords in movable forms.  This set expands into sixths, ninths, elevenths and thirteenths.  Also, covers altered 5ths and ninths in chords.  Even if you're very experienced you'll want to do the first CD set to understand the organization of the chords into separate forms.  Presentation is very well organized and the author is very talented.  Chords are practiced in several jazz standards with the author.  Highly recommended.",1393372800,,598,5.030612244897959
