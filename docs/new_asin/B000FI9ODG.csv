2566688,5,B000FI9ODG,"This is one of those shows that you are either just going to love or hate.  Personally, I love this stuff.  It is apparent that the cast has a great time while making these.  Often you will see them trying hard not to break out laughing themselves.  Of course, if you like your humor a little more sophisticated, this might not be for you.  If you like your laughs simple and basic this is what the doctor ordered to git-r-done.  Each show has a central theme, like aging or work, and all the sketches revolve around that.  The most fun, however, is watching the interplay between Foxworthy, Engvalls and Larry the Cable Guy.  Remember, you might be a red-neck if you laughat these jokes.",1154044800,9,688,4.491935483870968
