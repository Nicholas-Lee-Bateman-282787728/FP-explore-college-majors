4255666,3,B0043EZ46Y,"It is a great story and very much a tragic reality for the exploited people of the Andes, unfortunately the flow and authenticity of the film was ruined by the overdone and superficial interludes of surrealism that took the earthiness of the story from the heart back up into the head. It is still worth watching if you skip these overly art directed bits.",1293408000,7,356,4.578125
4255667,2,B0043EZ46Y,"Mostly entertaining because of the cultural background, however, story was flat and slow.",1431993600,,89,5.923076923076923
4255668,3,B0043EZ46Y,"This artsy film did not have a lot of resolution for me.  There are two stories.  One is with a European couple and one with a Peruvian couple.  Neither story lines were very compelling to me.  However, there were some great panoramic views, and if you like hearing 4-5 different languages in a film, it is enjoyable to watch.",1428278400,,326,4.47457627118644
4255669,5,B0043EZ46Y,Excellent Plot! With a deep message at the end. 5 stars to the max,1426550400,,66,3.7857142857142856
4255670,3,B0043EZ46Y,"Great acting however must have an open mind to believe that the indigenous people of the Andes believed mercury was somehow related to spirituality, nonetheless the exploitation of nature caused all that damage--what a shame to create so much chaos because people don't clean up after themselves..",1425772800,,297,5.340425531914893
4255671,5,B0043EZ46Y,"Brosens and Woodworth are a brilliant team - continue to present unique films. Khadak, by them, is also fabulous and visually indulgent.",1419465600,,136,5.2272727272727275
4255672,4,B0043EZ46Y,"A beautiful movie, showing the real damage being done throughout the world. We are not only killing ourselves, but we are depriving one another of our very humanity in the process.",1410134400,,180,4.838709677419355
4255673,4,B0043EZ46Y,"A complex artistic film where several greatly separated stories merge together.  The film is somewhat challenging, but I like challenges and found myself looking up terms such as ""pishtaco"", etc. that came up in the script.  It was well regarded at film festivals.  I'm pleased that this film is offered in my Prime package.",1409961600,3,324,4.962962962962963
4255674,3,B0043EZ46Y,"Interesting depiction of a mercury poisoning episode among Indians in the Peruvian ""altiplano."" The pace is much too slow.  The actual poisoning is only implied, not clearly shown.",1403568000,,180,5.428571428571429
4255675,5,B0043EZ46Y,"Very different and allegorical.  A unique picture of high altitude Indians in Peru, showing their strong religious beliefs along with their conflict with big company miners destroying the land.  Haunting music as well.",1402963200,3,218,5.575757575757576
4255676,5,B0043EZ46Y,"This is by far one of the most original films I have seen in recent times. Masterfully executed and extraordinarily photographed, Altiplano tells a tragic story where very different worlds collide and then reconcile. Haunting imagery where religious and pagan overtones coexist in perfect harmony. Peruvian Indians from the Altiplano of Turubamba are getting sick (and dying) as a result of Mercury poisoning (left by foreigners exploiting the mines). The indians believe the Mercury is liquid silver and they use it for religious purposes. Magaly Solier, the protagonist is an amazing and powerful actor.

The movie has many subplots going on and I believe the directors did an excellent work interweaving them.

If you are the type of person who takes the time to enjoy an art film and inundate your senses with beautiful images, this film definitely deserves a spot in your collection.",1350000000,7,888,5.159722222222222
8414861,4,B0043EZ46Y,"Beautiful images of the Peruvian Andes and a moving account of grief. I watched the film primarily to hear spoken Quechua, which is mixed with Spanish, French, English, and maybe more, but the English subtitles were fine. There are people dear to me who look just like the Peruvians in this film. It is a movie of atmosphere and themes more than dialogue or action.",1458259200,,365,4.630769230769231

8414864,5,B0043EZ46Y,"This is a great story of progress overstepping and ignoring the lives of what industrialists consider insignificant people or to the thinking the sacrifice of the few is necessary for the benefit of the many. It is all in English subtitles and it involves Belgian, Spanish, French and English languages in the movie. I loved this movie and I wish more American (USA citizens) could see this. Magnificent panorama of the Andes and I believe the natives speak their own dialogue besides Spanish. Incas descendants in today's Peru still speak their native tongue and also fluent Spanish.",1453852800,,584,5.030927835051546
8414865,5,B0043EZ46Y,"I absolutely love this film. I have traveled deep into the backcountry and away from in all on the Altiplano and this films cinematography is pure genius. If you truly watch the framing and composition of every cut, you will see there is no mistake with the framing. Maybe one needs to be a photographer to see what I see, but I am just saying the cinematography is out of this world... es perfecto.

A second reason why this film is truly a work of art is because... well... it is! The symbolism carried out with strong surrealist notes are somewhat gothic giving the film a slight creepy feel but never too much to make the viewer uncomfortable. I really feel this is a true arthouse film that I wish would have been considered for higher praise it so well deserves. But as most great works of pure genius, they get overlooked. We can however still marvel as we watch this masterpiece.",1450656000,,887,4.4753086419753085

8414867,4,B0043EZ46Y,"Little slow, but than again at that altitud and isolation every thing IS SLOW.  Thanks to the producer, director, actors and the setting (all involved) for a constructive message.  Mercury, should just be the engines on boats!",1441497600,,226,5.081081081081081
8414868,5,B0043EZ46Y,"Beautifully filmed; outstanding backgrounds and characters. A bit depressing, but an excellent reminder 500+ years of the plundering of South America by multiple nations that still continues today. Added to my collection after streaming it from Amazon Prime Video.",1440115200,,264,5.794871794871795
8414869,3,B0043EZ46Y,Great location shots in the high desert of Peru.  Movie was just a bit too artsy for me.,1439164800,,88,3.888888888888889
