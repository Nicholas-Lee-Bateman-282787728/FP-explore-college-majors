6889077,5,B00QW5MX2A,"Going to LA? Watch this doc...and then go online and book with ""Dearly Departed Tours"" for your trip! It's a great sampling opportunity. The host on the series, SCOTT MICHAELS, is an incredible historian of Hollywood scandals -- and you'll very likely get him as your tour guide! Fun!",1453593600,2,284,4.816326530612245

6889081,5,B00QW5MX2A,Excellent Volume 2 to this series.  I really hope Scott keeps putting this series out.  Scott takes you to the spots in Hollywood where famous people met their demise.  This is a DVD-R disc but I had no problem viewing it.  Pick up the Dearly Departed dvd and The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter dvd from Scott also.  Excellent Job Scott and crew!!!!,1438041600,,348,4.4603174603174605

6889083,2,B00QW5MX2A,"This was such a let down.  The first one was full of cool stories, as was Hollywood Death Trip, and you can't do better than Six Degrees of Helter Skelter. . .this doesn't stand up to the others in any way.  One star for Scott's personality  and dedication, and one for his efforts to preserve this history. Take a pass on this one and watch ones of the others.",1435968000,,361,4.202898550724638
6889084,4,B00QW5MX2A,Overall a good movie. Not as good as Vol. 1 in my opinion.  The movie seems to be clips pieced together over a few years.  The background score music seems very annoying at times.,1434844800,2,179,4.235294117647059
6889085,5,B00QW5MX2A,"If you love Hollywood stories from the old days when Hollywood stars were actually stars, as well as some of the newer happenings, this series is second to none. I cannot wait for the next installment.",1433721600,3,201,4.611111111111111
8693150,5,B00QW5MX2A,Much history and some visits to odd fan-favorite sites.  Re-enactments of horrible events in some cases.  Likeable guy as host.  Good Halloween disc.,1506211200,,149,5.391304347826087
