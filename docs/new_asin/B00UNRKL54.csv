7064237,5,B00UNRKL54,"The movie ""The Amazing You""  is a profound  Journey  of contact with the Self.
It makes us revise our dreams of the times we were little  kids, that sometimes we fail to cherish, disconnecting us, and failing to fulfill our purpose here, leading a life without meaning ... when we could have  Amazing Lifes, full of meaning and contributing to the new world that emerges.

Every interview, are lovingly made to reconnect us in this purpose, through the experiences shared by the incredible guests, and the questions what they show us.

We are here to reconnect the purpose of The Amazing Person that we are and offer our best to the world,  the movie""The Amazing You""  and  training program by Dr. Dragos Bratasanu is a path to this inner Journey."" ~ Mnica Lampe - Brazil",1449532800,,771,4.644444444444445
7064238,5,B00UNRKL54,"An absolutely magnificent story from a very inspiring person - his poor and seemingly hopeless background did not stop him from fulfilling his dreams. And making a movie with NASA legends, entrepreneurs like the creator of Angry Birds, and rock stars is just part of what he has achieved in life starting with absolutely nothing. A must-watch for people who are struggling on their path and trying to find the right ""thing' for them. I actually liked it so much I translated the subtitles into my own language for everyone to enjoy. He will take you on a journey to the best place in the Universe - your Heart.",1449360000,2,610,4.605504587155964

8707674,5,B00UNRKL54,"THE AMAZING YOU explores the infinite potential you start accessing when you begin to listen to the subtle yet powerful intelligence within your own heart. It's a feel good movie about the journey of discovery you embark on when you choose to go after 100% of what you believe in your mind and know deep in your heart is possible. Dr. Dragos interviews tops scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs and gets to the heart of what truly matters when it comes to going after your dreams. This is the kind of movie you'd want to watch when you are feeling lost and disconnected from your life purpose, or when you feel like your goals are too far out of your reach. Dr. Dragos is himself an example of what you can accomplish if you are willing to take the first step. The only thing I didn't like about the film is that there's no women being interviewed. But then again, there's something new and special about a whole bunch of guys talking about following your heart. Love it, and found it very inspiring! Can't wait for the next film!",1449705600,,1032,4.49468085106383
