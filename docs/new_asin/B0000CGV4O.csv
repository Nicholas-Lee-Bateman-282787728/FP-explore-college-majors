1920171,5,B0000CGV4O,"I'm really happy that they've come out with this!! I think all singers from 80's should release a DVD with all of their videos, cuz nowadays, you can't expect to watch any on MTV.",1071360000,2,179,4.294117647058823
1920172,4,B0000CGV4O,Pat Benatar had a really good run back in the early 80's&these videos capture some of the coolest moments of that time period. She truly had a cool edge&this is a good reflection on that time period. Good Stuff here&very detailed reflections.,1067126400,3,242,4.785714285714286
1920173,3,B0000CGV4O,"I love Pat Benatar, I have ever since I first heard that voice back in 1979. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this! I hadn't seen those videos in years and they are an integral part of her career and my love for her. The commentaries from Pat and Neil Giraldo are hilarious, although I think they could have made their homework a bit beforehand (they can never remember the name of the director and small details of such nature). My beef is with the record company. The second ""You Better Run"" starts, the image is grainy and particals can be seen throughout the video. The colors on some of those early videos is sloppy and over-saturated. This gets better as the DVD rolls on, but you can clearly tell the videos weren't digitally remastered. The 5.1 sound is o.k. but again I think a better job could have been done. But I'm most upset about ""Le Bel Age"". Comedian Richard Belzer had a part in the video but has been completly edited out. The least Chrysalis could have done is show us both versions of the clip. So is it essential for your collection? Of course! Is it the best it could have been? Unfortunatly no.",1066953600,5,1120,4.363636363636363
1920174,5,B0000CGV4O,"This is a great DVD. I have most of the videos on old VHS tapes, worn out and of poor quality. This new DVD has excellent quality and has all the videos with commentary by Pat and Neil about each video. A truely unique compilation that brought back great memories. Definitely makes you feel a little bit closer to Pat and Neil.",1064534400,7,327,4.290322580645161
1920175,5,B0000CGV4O,"This is what a collection of videos can be on Dvd.  Excellent sound (5.1 dolby)  Very inclusive....I think every one of her videos are here along with some live concert footage.  The video transfer is crisp and clear...you'd never guess some of them are 20+ years old.  Also the commentary with Pat and Neil is actually fun to watch. Unlike many in the past where all that is talked about is the technical making of the videos and the artsy way we portrayed the song.  ""Buy this dvd!"" you won't be disappointed.  PS Pat's new album ""GO"" is excellent also check it out!",1064448000,5,568,4.466019417475728
1920176,5,B0000CGV4O,"Not only do you get all of Pat's videos (25!!! plus 4 more live performances) but you also get the added bonus of complete commentary from Pat and husband Neil Geraldo for every single one. And you have the choice of either watching them comment or just hearing them comment. It's great to see them having a laugh over some of their more ""80s"" productions.
What other video compilation offers that?
ROCK ON, PAT!!!  This DVD is the best!",1064102400,9,437,4.531645569620253
1920177,5,B0000CGV4O,DVD is well worth the price if your any kind of fan of Pat Benatar. Some of the videos are absolute classics. Good to Great quality of audio/video depending on video.,1343001600,,166,4.387096774193548
1920178,5,B0000CGV4O,"Some of the earlier reviews have already listed all the music videos included in this collection, so there is no need to repeat that here. However, I can attest to the fact, that this compilation has got to be one of the greatest compilations of music videos, ever released by any musician, of any genre of music.  I love the entire collection. As one of the earlier reviewers pointed out, the only thing missing is ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"", however, there is more than enough other ""stuff"" to more than make up for this.

Some other things that make this collection special include: You can watch the videos without commentary from Pat and Spyder, or you can watch then with Pat & Spyder's commentaries. You get bonus live performances of ""Heartbreaker"" (circa 1980), ""I Need a Lover"" (circa 1980), ""Hell is for Children"" (Live at the Sun Theatre, Anahiem, CA, 2001), & ""Heartbreaker"" (Anaheim, CA 2001). Plus included is the very ""touching"" video of ""Christmas in America"", which has Pat singing, along with ""Spyder"" playing his electic guitar, in a snow white, winter wonderland setting. This very ""touching"" song was written by Pat as a ""musical healing"" song, after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. There is more information on this song available in the book ""Between a Heart and a Rock Place"", a Pat Benatar Memoir.

If you like Pat you'll love this video collection. If you like 80's music videos, you'll love this video collection. I definitely love it and I'm thankful that all these fantastic videos have finally been compiled and released on dvd, after all these years. Thanks!!!!",1305590400,,1594,4.831501831501831

1920183,5,B0000CGV4O,This is a great DVD of all of Pat Benatar's popular songs and videos.  A must-have for the true Pat Benatar fan!  It brought back a lot of memories watching these.,1203724800,,163,4.225806451612903
1920184,5,B0000CGV4O,"If you were to strap me into a chair and use mechanical devices to hold my eyes open and force me to watch these videos again and again for the rest of my life, I'd call it Heaven.
Pat Benetar is the hottest, most passionate singer of all time. Sure, some of the vids are a little corny, but we still get to see her strutting around in sexy clothes and belting out songs that ROCK!
I have zero problem that there is no video included for the song Hit Me With Your Best Shot, because frankly I think that is her worst song (she agrees-hence-no video) MY only suggestion here would have been to include her 1984 American Bandstand performance of Love is A Battlefield as well as the original video, because while the original video is smokin' (parade of chicks dancing their way out of the male oppressed bar and down the street to freedom...) the Bandstand performance was one of her most kittenesque and stunning moments, and whenever I watch it on You Tube I feel as though she is singing directly to me. Other than that this DVD is top notch, one of the top five DVD's of all time!",1197417600,,1083,4.313725490196078

1920186,4,B0000CGV4O,"I really enjoyed this DVD, not having seen most of the videos when they were originally aired.  The best part, however, is the commentary by Pat and Neil on each of the videos.  It really gives some great insight on what went on back then.  Recommended.",1176854400,,253,4.456521739130435
1920187,5,B0000CGV4O,"I've been a fan of Pat since before MTV, and have owned and listened to her phenomenal voice on vinyl and CD continuously since that time. This collection showcases her videos, and allows the viewer to see how both her performance, and the art of making videos, have evolved through time.

The earliest are just performance videos of her and the band on stage, before an audience (but no audience noise, these were filmed AS a video, so sound like studio recordings), then on to videos which ""tell a story"", some with very interesting costumes and set designs. In the ""Bonus"" section are some actual live videos from concerts, including one which appears to be quite recent. I'm pleased to report that both Pats voice and Neils guitar playing are both as wonderful as ever.",1175990400,2,773,4.725925925925926
1920188,5,B0000CGV4O,i thought the product was excellent and id recomend it to anyone who is a true fan of pat benetar .,1174694400,2,99,3.761904761904762
1920189,5,B0000CGV4O,"It's a great collection of videoclips, from the begining of Pat Benatar's career. The quality of them are not the ""state of art"", but for those who lived these days, they are special. She's a great singer and it's very interesting to see the evolution of her hair cuts. I loved it!",1167868800,3,281,4.423076923076923
1920190,4,B0000CGV4O,"Interesting to see these old videos.  To tell the truth, I had seen only a couple of them before.  I think it is wonderful to take a look back to a time when I was younger, and yes, it was pretty silly.  As an older person now, it is great to see when our generation had our turn to act and dress silly.  Mind you, Pat is a little cutie and can belt 'em out, too.  Nice disc if you want to take a look back.",1155859200,3,407,3.686046511627907
1920191,4,B0000CGV4O,"This DVD is really value for money.  There are 29 videos including four live performances.  Not all singles are represented though but this is possibly because there was not a video filmed for that particular song (eg. We Live For Love, Treat Me Right, Hit Me with your best shot).  The question is, why did they put on two live performances of ""Heartbreaker"" when they could have put a live version of one of the missing songs I have mentioned (from her various concerts).  The other bad point is the poor DVD art work, it really deserves better (the cover makes it look cheap).

Those little criticisms aside, what I really like about this video collection is that it is in chronological order, and each video contains an audio commentary (if selected) from Pat and her husband Nick.  There is also the option to include the video of them talking at the bottom of each video.  I enjoyed their commentary, it was honest and interesting.

Pat Benatar has one of the most blessed vocals of the female recording world.  Her classically trained voice is divine to hear.  The tracklisting is too long to mention, but it covers 90% of her best known songs. Overall, this is a highly recommended DVD.",1133913600,28,1194,4.642857142857143
1920192,4,B0000CGV4O,"Well this music DVD has loads of music hits by Pat Benatar. It starts out with her first video to her last video in order. I  never knew she married the guitar player, I can see why :0 this music DVD is deffinetly worth buying if you like Pat.",1126742400,5,243,3.9591836734693877
1920193,5,B0000CGV4O,"In addition to being the most broadcast woman on the radio, Pat Benatar was also one of the most recognized stars of the video era. While not as groundbreaking as Madonna or Michael Jackson, each one of her videos was distinctively Benatar.

""Choice Cuts - The Complete Video Collection"" is a 25 video dvd that has every one of her music videos from 1981 to today, all digitally remastered, looking and sounding great. Many of these became MTV classics: the WWII inspired promo for ""Shadows Of The Night"", the killer dentist clip ""Anxiety (Get Nervous)"" and, of course, that one for ""Love Is A Battlefield"". That last video may seem cheesy now, but it's still a classic. I also liked many of the other videos. The first few aren't that great but once you get to ""Precious Time"" everything is more or less fine. The video for ""Ooh Ooh Song"" is pretty dumb, however (though the song isn't exactly an intelligent piece of music, though I really like it). ""Sex As A Weapon"" is a stinging damnation of women who sold their bodies to sell records. Some labeled Pat as a hypocrite for releasing it, but if you watch closely, you realize she scolds herself as well. The worst videos are the ones from ""Wide Awake In Dreamland"". The songs are good, but I hated Pat's look in them. She always looked good with short hair rather than that obnoxiously long mane. The 1990s' R&B videos are excellent. But the ""Innamorta"" videos weren't that great (though the ""Somebody's Baby"" video was rather moving). The closing Christmas video is beautiful, though.

The bonus performances are great, and the commentary by Pat and guitarist/husband Neil ""Spyder"" Giraldo is cool, too. There is a hidden bonus in the ""Love Is A Battlefield"" video. Another reviewer tells you how to access it. This is a truly great dvd that belongs in any collectio.",1123632000,10,1822,4.70846394984326

1920195,5,B0000CGV4O,Just what I've been waiting for-music videos from Pat! They're all here along with commentary and more. I'm a big fan of videos so this is kinda like a dream come true. I've been a fan since I was a little girl. The videos are in order that they were released and with video selection you can see what album they came from. A++,1108339200,4,327,4.125
1920196,4,B0000CGV4O,"While some may say that the video age was on the brain dead side, it still occupies a warm spot in the hearts of others.  Nowhere is that made more clear than on this collection.  I've been a fan of Pat ever since the first time I heard her made-for-AOR pipes on local radio, and became a bigger fan after seeing just how good she looked on some of her earlier videos, but my wife is the true fan.  I bought this on the spur of the moment before we had even purchased a DVD player, and it was only recently that we finally got the chance to watch it.  We spent a Friday evening after the kids were in bed watching in amazement and with amusement almost twenty years of video Pat, and neither of us considered the evening lost.  On the contrary, the early videos from the dawn of the video age were a great nostalgia trip, while the middle ones were good for a laugh because they had somehow learned to take themselves too seriously.  We chose the option where Pat and Neil give their own commentary and explain what they were going through at the time and what some of the videos have come to mean to them.  Okay, so it isn't Casablanca, but if you grew up in the eighties it has a certain charm.",1094774400,15,1196,4.173913043478261

1920198,5,B0000CGV4O,"If you are into Eighties Rock and Roll, and are a fan of this talented young lady from New York you will find this video collection from Pat Benatar a delight.  Knowing that she was trained originally as an opera singer and then changed venues to Rock & Roll makes seeing these videos a necessity and a must for alll fans of this lady from the Eighties.  Especially, for me when she belts out out: Hit Me with Your Best Shot or Lipstick Lies or my Favorite, Shadows of the Night.  The first time I saw this video was on a ferryboat on the North Sea between Denmark and Norway in 1982, I have not seen it since but can always remember vaugely what the video protrayed.  I thought it was phenomenal then and still do as are the rest of the collection.",1088380800,30,749,4.216783216783217
1920199,5,B0000CGV4O,"This is a great, fun, DVD!  Most music DVDs now come with no extra's - artists seem to think they're doing their fans a favour just bothering to perform.  Pat & husband Niel Geraldo seem to be the exception.  This DVD comes with commentary on all the videos (except the bonus live footage), & it's great hearing their memories & thoughts.  A lot of the videos are very ""80's"" & cheesy, but hey, it was the 80's & that's how they made videos then.  Watch it with the commentary on & enjoy!",1084320000,2,488,4.260869565217392
1920200,5,B0000CGV4O,"Is there a cooler couple in the world than Pat Benatar and her guitarist husband Neil Geraldo?  Watch the video commentary to this collection and you tell me:  if this isn't the perfect marriage, what is?  They both look great, they've been on a long fun journey and they clearly adore each other.  Pat's cackle at her most retro moments are worth the price of this collection alone.  NOTE:  I bought this DVD collection along with the CD of ""Best Shots""; there is now a double disc collection (which I got for $20.99) which is more of a bargain than the DVD itself.  And I mention this VIDEO COMMENTARY with Pat and Neil on-screen because it isn't listed as a feature in this double disc; I pretty much stumbled across it.  If you're as sick of today's canned pop and endless ""Idols"" as I am, go back to the days when we had really cool singers with unique styles -- like Stevie Nicks, Debbie Harry and, yes, Pat Benatar.

Although I had never seen any other of her videos I opted to get this. I was blown away at how many videos she did have. Although some are kinda corny but Pat pulls them off with grace and her ""hard chick"" style. I also love the ""Invincible"" video and i have always loved that movie Legend Of Billie Jean which i hope they will put on DVD someday.

1920203,5,B0000CGV4O,"It's a shame that most copies of this DVD will be bought by fans in their mid to late thirties. Pat Benatar is a singer with talent that cannot even be touched by the wannabes we hear today. Could you imagine Britany or Christine trying to cover a Pat Benatar song? It's ridiculous. Like Britany could even come close to Pat's original version of Wuthering Heights. I'm sorry I just can't stop laughing.
Pat Benatar is ageless, all pure talent is. 200 years from now people will appreciate her 2.5 octave range voice, and hard biting songs. Sure some of these videos are silly (Love is a Battlefield and Anxiety Get Nervous border on ridiculous), but Pat and husband Neil know that. However how can you not fall in love with Pat as you watch her sing through Le Bel Age in classic black and white? Or the heartache of the 'lost' video 'Painted Desert'.
I not only recommend this video for the Patty B fans who loved her 20 years ago, but for teenage girls today who have no idea how a woman can really make a name for herself in the music business.",1079049600,5,1048,4.37948717948718

I know that Pat herself does not care for the song, but fans do, and it should have been included somehow on this DVD collection.
Of course, there were some nice gems on it, and quite a few videos I have never seen...

Oh, I remember it all well myself and look back with the much of the humor as they do while listening to this DVD.

This was a nice surprise to find this video collection available and it offered a nostalgic trip through the early hits as well as a chance to see a couple of more recent songs I had not even heard before. Many of my feelings are echoes of comments made by other reviewers but the one thing I want to add is my pointing out the quality of the audio. If you have it hooked up to 5.1 receiver, make sure you set the audio option to 5.1 and you will surely be impressed as was I. I`m sure I will be playing this DVD quite a lot!",1355961600,,612,3.865079365079365
