8031360,5,B0002S9QT6,"Third time is the charm. This is the third movie ""Ginger Snaps Back"" in the ginger snaps series and in my opinion the best. The first ""Ginger Snaps"" of course always get the privilege of being unique as a different more caring wolfy sisters. The second ""Ginger Snaps 2"" however was nothing more than an exploitation film relying on the reputation of the first film.

They seem to have found more money for this prequel and took acting lessons as this film was beautiful and well organized. There were a few overdone ""Blair Witch"" type scenes but they did not distract form the over all feel. It was a bit darker but would have been impossible to make otherwise. You may also notice that they had to go out of their way to show the sisters periodically as the story and some of the other actors were acting rings around them.

During the early exploration of the continent (1815) a group of people built a fort on the edge of the known world. Through a series of misfortunes and events two sisters Bridget and Ginger are lead to the fort by a mysterious native. There they encounter some odd characters and something unspeakable howling outside the fort.

Is it safer inside or out side the fort?
What is seen in the future and must it come true?
Is the bond of sisters stronger than any adversity?

8031361,3,B0002S9QT6,"I was a little leery of this movie when I heard there was  a third one. And I was right to be.
Being a fan of the original I cringe at this third installment because it's basically the same storyline as the first one, but without the spark that made it so special. It takes place in the 19th century, yet they still talk like they would in the 20th century.  We don't get to see the interesting bond between Brigitte and Ginger, the morbid humour, and the quirky supporting characters.  It seems as though the storyline is stuck because there's nowhere really to go with it.
I hope they stop making sequels to Ginger Snaps because they are destroying the original.  Although I enjoyed the sequel and would definitely recommend it, it still wasn't as good as the first. This should have been a sign of things to come.
The 3 is generous. I have a suspicion that they keep making more of these sequels to show off the more realistic looking transformation into a werewolf. And it does look scarier, but in the end the story leaves you unsatisfied and dumbfounded.",1098921600,,1060,4.476683937823834
