8099166,3,B000CKIY92,"I got this for $1 at Family Dollar, and actually quite enjoyed it. The quality of the artwork in the animation is pretty much Saturday morning TV show/straight-to-video quality, which is what it was made for in 1988 in Australia. The transfer is a bit grainy and soft, but for a $1 DVD, it's quite acceptable. The story, artwork, songs are not the caliber of Disney's classic version, but it's quite entertaining, and a good item to pick up for curiosity's sake.",1156204800,2,462,4.646341463414634
8099167,3,B000CKIY92,"Not the most faithful movie adaptation of the amazing book, but far from the worst adaptation too. The anaimation isn't bad it's just not ""eye catching"" enough... but the voice work on Alice, the hearts kingdom citizens, and the chesire cat is really well done I think (heck, Alice even has the cockney aceent, as I've long imagined she likely had in Lewic Carroll's imagination).  While not all of the book made it into this movie's screenplay and some random stuff was added, it doesn't have any singing flowers either.  Really, it's a pretty good take on the story though it's condensed into 50 minutes and that helps its case (longer would have been too much methinks). The imbedded meaning behind all that the author wrote into his stroke-of-genius books isn't alluded to here, but that's easy to overlook as this was clearly meant for afternoon entertainment and not to be thought-provoking... If you can watch and just accept, you'll dig this.

A 1988 Australian production that's made its way to thrifty-nickel DVD, I bought because the story is one of my favorites of all time.  The only real deep-down gripe I can make about this version of Alice is that the theme song is wretched and annoying... and made worse by the fact it's repeated nearly a half a dozen times throught the movie.  ICK.

Not great but by no means terrible either, it's worth seeing for fans of Alice and her descent into the curiouser and curiouser.",1149292800,2,1432,4.730923694779117
