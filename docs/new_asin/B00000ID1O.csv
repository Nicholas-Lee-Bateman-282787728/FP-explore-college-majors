I can not agree with the simple statement made by simplymidget, he/she nailed it on the head.  This movie does not disappoint, it is very much a Troma like movie. I will add; to me personally,  it also has a grindhouse element in it at the same time and it works. Just the actors outfits and film color. I love this movie and it is exactly what anyone is looking for in a great ""bad B movie"".

I read the synopsis and saw whore house/abortion clinic + toxic goo = killer fetus.  Killer fetus... Oh man i love it.  They had some pretty good early effects for the creature based on the budget.  The killer fetus is in essence: The Toxic Avenger had sex with The Blob.....this just might be its offspring.

The stop motion used in  the kitchen scene is sooooo cheesy its adorable.

The movie keeps chugging along and keeps you into it.  If you don't like this movie, you are not a fan of good bad movies.

I have to say I did not care for the incest scene.  And for some reason....call me crazy, I have the strangest urge to play racket ball.

That's a wrap.",1510099200,,1070,4.181372549019608

7910324,4,B00000ID1O,"The Suckling is truly amazing if you like watching REALLY bad cinema. It boggles the mind at every twist and turn of the worst plot ever devised. I would say that the direction (?!) reminds one of the legendary Ed Wood, but the acting in The Suckling is beyond description. It has to be seen to be believed...",1173312000,4,309,4.344827586206897
7910325,1,B00000ID1O,"To any fan of outr&eacute; cinema, the description on the back of the DVD case is simply mouthwatering. Back-alley abortion, toxic waste, an ambulatory mutant fetus, a group of people trapped in a house of ill repute--all the earmarks of a fun, campy, over-the-top horror movie.  If nothing else, it's probably one of those so-bad-it's-good flicks in the Ed Wood vein, right? WRONG!  Wrong, at least, if the film in question is 1990's THE SUCKLING (released as SEWAGE BABY in the UK). Although released on DVD by the well-regarded Elite Entertainment--which has distributed some ""lost"" gems in the past such as the Alan Ormsby-scripted POPCORN (1991), Tobe Hooper's EATEN ALIVE (1977), and the highly controversial I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978), among others--THE SUCKLING is way beneath the company's usual offerings.

Many popular and successful low-budget and indie films rise above their meager foundations by exploiting a well-written script, a talented group of actors, or skilled crew members and technicians.  Or clever filmmakers can even use humor and copious T&A to disguise weak material, talentless actors, or an inexperienced crew.  Unfortunately for the viewer, it seems the makers of THE SUCKLING not only lacked quality material and personnel, they were also not clever enough to camouflage their shortcomings.  Instead, their film reads like a school project slapped together by students who hadn't yet decided if they were going to actually major in filmmaking or not.

The overall look of THE SUCKLING is more frightening than the eponymous infant itself.  Set decoration is drab or bleak at best, and though the bulk of the film's action takes place in a single room, very little (if anything) is done by way of camera work or editing to add zip to the dull surroundings or to achieve any sort of visual interest.  The script is replete with unrealistic and often stilted dialogue, and the obviously amateur actors deliver most of their lines with the same emotive flair seen in high-school productions.  Though small bits of humor are thrown in here and there--one of the best gags is when the abortionist is cleaning off her ""medical"" instrument, then bends it back into its original shape and uses it to hang up her lab coat--they are incongruous with the starkness of the surrounding dialog and events, making it confusingly unclear if the film is intended as camp or serious drama. All the T&A in the film is delivered mainly at the film's beginning with an in-your-face subtlety that makes it seem as if it were tacked on as an afterthought. Not only that, but the nudity is mixed in with downright goofy visual gags that are even more incongruous than the other laughs scattered haphazardly throughout the film.  Worse yet, the denouement of the primary tissue-thin plot is downright ridiculous and unbelievable, and the following epilogue is so predictable and cliche that even a blind person could see it coming.

There is no doubt that those who made THE SUCKLING are fans of horror cinema.  Several aspects of the film are obviously influenced by greats of the genre: As in Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) and its first two sequels, the protagonists are trapped and confined to one locale, forcing them to confront their preternatural enemy if they are to have any hope of survival; a mutant baby, fresh out of the womb, has become a powerful and formidable killing machine, much like the titular character in Larry Cohen's IT'S ALIVE (1974); and the suckling itself has many characteristics of the titular character in ALIEN (1979). Sadly, when making THE SUCKLING, their enthusiasm as fans didn't match their sense of cinematic aesthetics or technical skill, and it is surprising that they were ever able to get such a film into wide distribution.  In truth, a film of this low caliber should've been screened only at the filmmakers' own informal parties or family reunions, if ever shown at all.

The DVD from Elite Entertainment is a no-frills disc offering only a theatrical trailer (one nearly as slipshod in quality as the film itself). It's hard to say if the transfer is a good one, as there is so much grain in the original film that it would be nearly impossible to see any digital artifacts even if there were some. It doesn't really matter anyway, as the DVD edition of THE SUCKLING should be of interest only to those needing an example of really deplorable cinema.",1154908800,5,4418,4.935309973045822
7910326,1,B00000ID1O,"Released in Britain as ""Sewage Baby"", that title more aptly sums up this film

What could have been a good film is killed by only a few faults; bad script, poor acting, and really weak/cheap special effects.

Don't believe the other two reviews. It has no 'social message' about abortion. It is just a film exhibiting one badly mauled person after another - at the hands of an aborted child, who flushed into the sewer comes in contact with some kind of mutant-producing chemical waste! Yep, it's that bad.

What would have been better is if the creature used its umblical cord to feed off its victims in some kind of parasitic way, instead of slashing them with its claws for no apparent reason - it doesn't really feed off them.

Also, I was fooled into thinking that this was a recent film. It was made in 1990, over 15 years ago. It shows in that everyone still has 80s hair (it may have been made prior to 1990, and only first released then).",1134864000,2,947,4.425287356321839
7910327,5,B00000ID1O,"It has been many years since a movie has come along as astounding terrifyingly and dramatically as the Suckling, a visual tour-de-force, unstoppable in horror and hitting you with new revelations about life, love, and happiness every second. This is not a film to be missed, the greatest love story of our time, and a masterpiece of modern cinema.",1107561600,10,347,4.898305084745763
