The Live material from a 1989 concert on their home turf  is magical, empowered with the energy to move and the melodies to stir the heart. A great great band that not only write and perform their original masterpices but touch moments of Randy Newman's ""Sail Away"", Spooner Oldham's ""Dark End of the Street"".
Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this great DVD and share it with as many friends as possible.....................",1168732800,4,802,5.913793103448276
