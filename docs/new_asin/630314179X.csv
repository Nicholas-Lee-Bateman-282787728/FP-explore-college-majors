1177292,5,630314179X,"I well remember when this movie (there's a book by the same title) came out in the 70's.  It's about a 13 year old girl who meets a young man who fronts a band she recently heard and develops a crush on him.  He believes that she is older than she really is and she parlays that mistake into a relationship that is almost too far ahead of her experience for her to handle.  She becomes progressively more conniving until she finally lands herself in more than she can handle and, along with the resulting growing pains, she has a lot of explaining to do, to a lot of people.  It's a good story for young people but many of today's won't find it interesting since it belongs to their parent's teenage years.  But those of us who were teens in the 1970's (especially women) will remember how dreamy ""Michael"" was and how lucky we thought Jessie was.",1454371200,3,847,4.3354430379746836

But to watch it again brings back alllllll the feelings I had back then. When the band starts chiming in to Jessie's Song - I can SO remember how much I too fell in love with Michael Skye!

1177329,5,630314179X,This the best book of my time! I have always loved this book back in the 70s! Jesse is 13 and is in love with her guitar teacher Michael who is 17. She goes around pretending she is 16 and gets him to fall in love with her! She ends up having to tell him the truth and she loses him but he loves her so they try and work it out great story always loved it!,1401148800,,356,3.6363636363636362
1177330,5,630314179X,"This movie is a true 70's classic! If you are / or have been a 13yr old girl, you have dreamed that you could be Jessie and have the experiences she has in this movie!! Every girl dreams of the perfect guy and Micheal is as close as it comes!

It is pure fantasy but it is so entertaining that you can't look away! I saw this movie in 1978, bought the soundtrack on LP and then all of Rex Smith's albums! I am a true fan and this movie is an all-time favorite!

Imagine ""Michael Skye"" writing and singing a song just for you! Stars that glisten, Lips for kissing, Honey listen, It's true, No one ever, Loved you better, Love you Honey, I Love You!! It's too good!

The parents are so out of touch, it's funny, they are on the right track but a little too late! At least they have raised a pretty good/smart girl and she can take care of herself. Caroline is too cute as the best friend. And Karen, although she is not in the book, is a good addition, because she adds a layer to Michael that makes him more adorable because he resists her and holds out for Jessie, his true love!",1398297600,3,1079,4.104265402843602
1177331,5,630314179X,"I remember this movie from back when I was a young teen.  I had the biggest crush on Rex Smith.:)  I ordered this DVD to watch the movie again because it's such a sweet movie, and as far as I know, it hasn't aired on TV again since the original broadcast - well at least I haven't seen it on any station.  Really cute movie.  Rex Smith and Denise Miller are great and have nice chemistry together.",1398038400,,397,4.116883116883117

1177334,5,630314179X,"Absolutely wonderful movie. Great storyline, great acting, AWESOME music. Rex Smith was the sexiest man alive at the time. You would think that his acting would be cheesy but its not. It comes across as very sincere. A very nuanced performance. And his chemistry with Denise Miller is very genuine. What's funny is that in the movie the two characters were only 4 years apart, 17 and 13. But in reality they are 8 years apart. Rex was 23 and Denise was 15! She must have been in heaven working on this movie with him. Sigh... what a fantasy.",1391644800,,541,4.474747474747475
1177335,5,630314179X,"Sooner or Later did not disappoint! I first saw this movie when I was 21 and loved it! Rex Smith is such a talented singer and did a great acting job on the movie and Denise Miller was pretty and comedic. I then bought the cassette tape that had songs from the movie. After much play, it died and I have thought about the movie for many years wishing I could see it again and lo and behold, Amazon carried it! I quickly purchased it and have already viewed it 3 times. I am waiting for my daughter to have a break from college so she can watch it with me.",1391385600,,555,4.009009009009009

1177339,2,630314179X,"kinda thinks this movie is...creepy? Yes, I read the book back when it first came out and saw the movie on TV. Of course when you're the age of Jessie the book and movie will make you swoon just as I used to hearing Rex sing ""You Take My Breath Away.""

Decided to revisit my old VHS tape of this recently and watching it now with older eyes I had a whole different take on it. Now don't get me wrong...coming of age in the 70's and 80's myself makes me a sucker for this kind of nostalgia but maybe I've become an old ""prude"" over the years,lol.

First of all, if Rex Smith is supposed to be 17 in that movie then I'm a monkey's uncle. Mother's...would you want your 13 year old daughter dating this ""older"" man? I'm sure you'd be cringing in your boots if you saw this shaggy teenage boy with painted on jeans coming to pick up your daughter in a STATION WAGON. Well,that's not really the point of view we're supposed to be watching this movie from. It's about Jessie and her ""first love"". And what a first love this is! No wonder she hid all this from her parents. (like we all did!)

""Michael.oh Michael...Michael"" Jessie mutters throughout. Oh Brother! Yes,Jessie looks older with makeup but he really didn't have a CLUE how young she was? Her behavior at the movie didn't ring a bell?

And what about how they show him stopping at a liquor store and coming out with a 6 pack. 17 and buying beer? Sure, we know it happens but I thought it was a little odd showing this in a film for such a young,impressionable audience even if it was filmed back in the late 70's when perhaps things were more lenient.

Well, I won't spoil any storyline here but I must say the soundtrack to this movie is probably the best thing about it. I still have the vinyl record stashed away in my collection and everytime I hear ""You Take My Breath Away"" it does conjure up a lot of emotion but,luckily for me,it doesn't remind me of this film since I heard it before seeing the movie. The ending was a surprise for me...again, totally unbelievable. Next time I go to watch this will be LATER then SOONER. Too bad because Rex is a fine singer...hints of David Cassidy..and the most gorgeous head of hair that ever graced the screen.",1383004800,,2212,4.320481927710843

Rex Smith and Denise Miller are really good in this film. I did not know there was a book written by Bruce Hart and Carole Hart that the movie was based on until a couple of weeks ago. There are also two books after this one to let us know how the rest of the story goes. I have ordered them and can't wait to receive them and read them!!!,1369699200,,479,3.742574257425743

Denise Miller is terrific in the lead role.  She is a natural and really makes you feel for her character.  Rex smith has a beautiful voice and is also great in this role.

1177351,5,630314179X,I saw this movie on network television and fell in love with Rex SmithI have had on my wish list forever and decided to buy it,1366243200,,126,3.8846153846153846
1177352,5,630314179X,"What a way to relive my preteen years. I saw this movie when I was 12, Rex Smith was my first crush. I still love this movie just as much as I ever did!",1366156800,,152,3.5
1177353,3,630314179X,"I remember watching this movie as a girl and thinking that it was so romantic and dreamy.  Rex Smith of course was handsome,talented and gallant, and Jesse was ""every girl"" who wanted to be with the cool guy. At the time I thought the ending was perfect and I wondered if Michael and Jessie could actually make their romance work into a happily-ever-after!

Now as a mom with a 13-year-old of my own, I wonder what the parents were thinking?  Why were they afraid to actually talk to her about sex and boys, and what the heck was the talk Jesse and her mom had even about?

I also was a bit mortified with the ending - a 17 year old boy is going to let the 13 year old make all the decisions? If she were my daughter she'd be driven to a different guitar teacher!  In retrospect I also had a lot more questions about Michael's sexuality - as a young man who doesn't date, rebuffs advances from a girl his own age, and then decides it's a good idea to date a 13 year old!

The scene with Jesse and her grandmother was touching although I'm not sure it added to the plot!

I vividly remember watching Sooner or Later as a teenager and loving it. I also had the book. Even after thirty years of not seeing it, I remembered so much of it, especially the scene between Jessie and her grandma.  That was so touching.

While Sooner or Later seems overly simplistic by today's standards, Bruce and Carole Hart touched upon so many young teenage girls fantasies.  Who didn't crush on an older guy who was out of reach?  Who didn't dream that Donny Osmond wasn't crooning ""Puppy Love"" just to them?  (or fill in your teen dream star).  And letting her take control of the romance?  Yes, the Harts knew what they were writing!

I have watched this several times and it just puts a smile on my face.  Watching a young Rex Smith is heavenly! I loved the picture gallery segment in the menu.  You get to see the stars off camera and how some of the scenes were filmed.

""Ewww! she's 13 and he's 17""!  They were shocked he was buying beer at 17.  Finally, they told me that Rex Smith is not cute!  I still think he is!
Even though they made fun of the movie, they seemed to enjoy it.  The overall message being that everyone meets someone at about 13, that they fall for and
Love has no age hangups.  That thrilled my 13 year old! perhaps she thought this is her year.
 It still was a joy to watch this movie, and the songs were still sweet.  The happy ending was the best, he came back!  They were gonna ""take things slow"", because he loved her. In reality, Imagine the ridicule of his friends, that he's seeing a 13 year old.  My daughter said in ""our days, that is considered HOT by some guys""

Finding this on Amazon takes me back to standing in line with friends at a local mall to have Rex sign our 'Sooner Or Later' albums. Yes, it's cheesy, innocent, and I don't think the men will love it... but for women who came of age during the late 70s/early 80s, and maybe even some of the younger ones, it will be an enjoyable trip back to a time when it was less technical, and less 'dangerous' than growing up today, though no less heartbreaking.

1177381,5,630314179X,"This movie was a great find.  I bought it for two reasons - One: the reviews were very positive and; Two: I really enjoy trying to find ""older"" nostalgic movies.  I did not know a lot about Rex Smith - only from his ""Solid Gold"" hosting days.  This movie far exceeded my expectations.  Everything I had read about it and other peoples comments were true.  It really took me back to a time when video games, computers and constant TV viewing was not a way of life for everyone.  Life was a lot simpler, people had a kinder way about them and kids got out and enjoyed their free time without relying on electronic games to do their thinking and playing.  Being outdoors and in the fresh air was your life.
Do yourself a huge favour and see this movie.  Even if you do not know who Rex Smith is, if you don't know his music, or even if you were not born in the 1970's (by the way I was 8 years old when this movie was made) - take a chance on this movie.  You will be pleasantly surprised at how lovely a film it is.
The lead role played by Denise Miller is beautifully acted.  The songs are catchy and fun.  They are sung by Rex, who has a terrific voice and heart-throb good looks to carry this role through.  A perfect combination to make this a very believable story.  By the way, how dreamy is the ""Simply Jessie"" song?  What teenage girl didn't dream of being sung to like that by their favourite rock star.

When she had her makeup done at the mall and Michael fell for Jessie he kept staring at her.  Other then that I didn't really remember most of it.  I guess I was to young to be into the whole dating scene.  I think it's a great story and gosh forgot how unbelievably cute Rex Smith is.  Denise Richards was a real pretty girl to bad she didn't go onto more things.  Rex Smith also did a great job but I guess he's into broadway shows nowadays.

Like was she expected to go all the way with him even if she was sixteen some of us girls wait in a relationship, and they didn't know each other very long.  Also her parents didn't seem to know what was going on with her and most parents would care if their 13 year old daughter was dating a 17 year old, that is a big age difference at that age.  But don't get me wrong I still love the movie and would recommend it to any teen as long as they understood some of these things.

Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie and Denise Miller does give an excellent performance. There are some very good scenes, such as the jogging in the park scene, and several good humorous lines.

However  - Maybe I am a prude, but I had a little problem with the ending. Even in today's age 13 is a little young for girls to be dating (I know it was just one date) - especially when the boy is 17 years old.

Also - it was amazing that Jesse's parents really had no idea that their 13 year old daughter was taking a bus all over the city and sneaking behind their backs to date a 17 year old high school student. In fact, they did not seem to know their daughter at all.

I wish the 2 would have agreed to wait a couple of years and then see how they felt. And how many 17 year olds, especially one that looked like Rex Smith, would really want to be with a 13 year old when they could have anyone?

We could both identify with all of the emotions, confusion, exhiliration, and lust that Jesse was going through.  My sister is married now with 2 teenaged daughters.

I always wondered why I'd never seen it shown again on TV after all these years and wanted to see it again.  When I found out it was available on DVD, I wasted no time purchasing a copy.

As the movie began, I was completely transported back in time and was shocked that I was able to sing right along with all the songs as if 27 years had not passed since the last time I viewed it!!  I think it spurred my first fantasies of ""love"" and finding that perfect older guy.  LOL

I, like Jessie was 13 and he was 18 and I was so in love, I can say I still feel that little flutter when I think of him today.

I promised myself that if I ever had girls I would share this movie with them.  Alas I grew up forgot about the movie till I came across a Rex Smith web site many years ago, I went out and bought the VHS.  I have since shared it with my 2 daughters when they both turned 13 and they both love it.  We still watch it on that old pitiful tape, at least once a year and have a mom daughter night.  Now that I have found it on DVD you can bet that I will be purchasing it so that I may share this special love story with my granddaughter (when the time finally comes), so that we may share a special night together like I did with their Mommies :)",1155945600,3,988,3.8374384236453203
1177408,5,630314179X,"Wow what a great teen movie! I remember this one very well and it crossed over racial barriers too (I'm African-American)

It came on televsion around spring time in 1979, I was thirteen years old then and in the 8th grade. I watched this movie and fell completely in love with the characters. I mean I just sat in front of the t.v. transfixed and went thru every emotion that ""Jesse"" experienced wondering what was gonna happen next!

Like every other young girl back then I too looked at ""Micheal"" with star-struck desire.  Well he was very hot with those tight jeans and all that hair flowing (in spite of my brother saying he looked like a girl.)

The thing about this movie that made it so sweet and tender was the interactions between ""Jesse"" and ""Micheal"". Teacher and student, hot boy and younger girl. He was attracted to her and wanted her every bit as much as she wanted him. And that is what sparked all of our hopes as young girls watching!

Jesse was hopeful and that is something that all of us want to have.  Jesse believed in magic and that is something that all of us want to believe in. This storyline is so positive and hit all the right cords on so many levels I can't even begin to express them all.

The most positive message being the fact that you should always believe in love no matter what obstacle stands between you.  Love is magic and if you believe then magical things will always happen.

A few months after seeing this movie, I started high school and had my first and only major crush. Ah he was 17 years old and captin of our basketball team and I was well...the 13 year old groupie.  No, I didn't get him then but the jury is still out now...we've recently gotten back in touch with each other and four years between us is nothing now.

I brought the VHS for my niece years ago and this is her favorite movie by far. I'm buying the DVD for my personal collection.

And yes, I'm certain that when I reach the sunset of my life, I will stumble upon this movie and watch it again with some remnant of youthful hope. And I will believe in love's magic and bask in it's tender glow for one second longer then I intended.",1153872000,4,2152,4.312655086848635

I met my first love when I was 13, he was a race car driver with SCCA.  Yes, he was a bit older then I was, and yes I would wear makeup to look older especially when we were around his friends.  He knew I was only 13 though, we as Michael said in the movie took it slow. Things were different back then.  We did eventually get married and were together for the first time and we had a little girl together.  We were married for ten years.  We did grow apart, I think I grew up and he stayed the way he was. It is strange as you get older how much more you can appreciate your young adult times.

When I saw this movie it made me remember how special your first love is.  It was if I were 13 again and had my first kiss. I tried for years to get a copy of the movie and never caught it again on tv.  My son, explained to me in this day and age of computers it was very easy.  I got it in the mail last night and even at 49 years old, I watched it and felt all thoes feelings all over again.  Who said it's corny?  It is touching, sweet and  in these days of sex and violence I love the sweet emotional recall of my young adult times.  Rex and Denise were so good together. It truly is my favorite.

It is not a good thing to live in the past but thank you Rex for letting a old lady visit it for an hour and a half(ok, I admit I watched it twice).  It brought back all my Jr. High days and made me smile and cry.  ""You Take My Breath Away"", was great. I would give it 10 stars and a ""sweet"" not ""corny"" rating.

When you got him, you felt scared, and alive.  This movie will bring back those wonderful feelings and more.  In addition, this is where the song ""You take my breath away"" was originally released.

1177418,5,630314179X,"Somewhere I read that a viewer rated this movie as having 10 stars, in part because of what it was about, but mostly because of how it made them feel. And how does it make me feel, like I am thirteen all over again. As Jesse puts it, NICE! This little gem of a movie has stayed with me for years and I surprise myself on how much of it I remember. I only saw it once 26 years ago and I still remember it as though I saw it yesterday.
I have read from other comments that it was viewed as a afternoon school special in 1979. But I recall that it was shown on prime time the year before. One of those movie of the week things. I had kept, for almost 10 years, the t.v. guide clipping of the film so I know the year of the original release was 1978. On the clipping, Michael's age was written down as 19, not 17. I don't know if that was a T.V. guide error or if it was the original age his character was suppose to be and they later changed it because the age difference was larger. Sadly, the clipping is long gone, having been discarded a few years after college when I cleared my stuff from my parents place.
Watching the film again brought me back to the end of eight grade when I first saw it. Being the same age as Jesse in the movie, I was just months away from turning 14. Unlike the movies, I wasn't lucky enough to get a gorgeous, rock star, boyfriend, but it was and still is fun to see how Jesse got hers. It's a rare film that lasts through the years and changing times and still packs an emotional wallop. The message remains the same. Your first love, will always be the sweetest, most fondly remembered moment.
I just ordered the DVD of the movie, as well as the three books (Sooner or Later, Waiting Games, Now or Never) since I only discovered they are now available. I read from other viewer comments that the third book ends abruptly, leaving the door open for a fourth book? Seems the story of Michael and Jesse is not yet over. I hope Bruce and Carole Hart will heed our plea and conclude the Michael and Jesse story with a happy send off.
The songs were wonderful, ""Simply Jesse"" being my favorite with ""You take my Breath Away"" a very close second. It's a film you can watch again and again. Though dated, it's appeal is still strong. A nice glance back to our teenage years during the late seventies, early eighties, when Shaun Cassidy was the latest hottie, station wagons ruled the roads, and feathered hair was the look to die for.",1078704000,71,2457,4.19661733615222

Rex Smith is DREAMY! And Denise Miller is a perfect incapsulation of nearly every teen I knew in the 70's/80's.
Ironic that the subject of a 13 year old and 17 year old having ""romantic relations"" is the stuff of Jerry Springer and Montell Williams talk shows...but for most of us it's just a part of growing up.
I think there is a sequel to this...but I can't find any info on it! I wanna see how their relationship progresses!!
