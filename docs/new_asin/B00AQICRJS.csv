8556380,5,B00AQICRJS,A great retrospective of Billy's best and most well-known hits.  No collection should be without this one!,1412985600,,106,5.235294117647059
8556381,4,B00AQICRJS,"Make no mistake, I love Billy Idol. However, the few available video's really don't do him much justice in capturing the intensity of his performances. This particular show didn't really warrant a good shelf life. Other concerts by other artists can be watched repeatedly. Sadly for Billy, this just didn't do it. It's good it's just not Billy Idol GREAT, if you know what I mean.",1407024000,3,380,4.7727272727272725
8556382,4,B00AQICRJS,"This is a very rare seen concert. It shows billy in his truly punk mode, as well as his most wild era. It was great to watch him in one of his life evolvements, a concert worth watching over and over again.",1370044800,5,206,3.9285714285714284
