From the beginning you can see something different in the film quality . It's crisp and not so video looking so it gives it more credibility. I was drawn in by the neighborhood looking familiar . Than I saw some nude jogging dude and that made me laugh so I was in for the rest of the film. I recognized a few familiar faces like jeffrey Lewis and Karen Black. And this really cute women (Troy byer)'. The star was not familiar to me but I think his part was well played in a very real way. It was kinda like watching some kinda off dude among actors.

The story is compelling enough to keep your interest and the dream sequences were really well done. I think his director has some cool tricks. I look forward to seeing him doing more. I'd also like to see the lead actor ( forget his name) in another role to see if he is really tweaked or just a good actor!!! Imm thinking just a realistic actor. We need more of that.

All in all I think people will enjoy this film. If your looking for a period piece or a horror move like the BEGOTTEN(freakiest movie ever), than save your $$$$ but if your like to be entertained, tins might be what your looking for!",1304467200,,1260,4.155737704918033
