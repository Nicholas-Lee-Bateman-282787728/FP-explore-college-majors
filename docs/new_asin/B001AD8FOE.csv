8276883,1,B001AD8FOE,"In an age where films are remastered and restored and treated with care and presented in best possible format,I don't see why they didn't do it for this film. The company that released this DVD-R (Sinister Cinema) do indeed live up to their name in doing a very sinister job on this DVD release: the transfer looks like a very bad vhs, has fuzzy and muffled sound and terrible image quality. I'm not fussy when it comes to rare films, I've watched average quality DVDs yet they remain bearable and watchable but this DVD really pushes endurance to the limit: the company just didn't care about releasing the film in a decent transfer. This is very annoying as the film seemed like an interesting hitman film but it just becomes more unenjoyable as the quality so horrendous, I switched it off after 5 painful minutes.",1334016000,,817,4.641379310344828
