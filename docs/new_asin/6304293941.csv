834388,5,6304293941,"Jim Hawkins is a tavern owner's son who acquires a map showing the location of buried treasure. He shows it to an adventurous squire who recognizes its value and outfits the good ship Hispaniola to set off in search of the prize. The squire hires Jim as a cabin boy and persuades his own physician to join the crew as ship's doctor. The gullible squire's first big mistake is to sign up a rascal named Long John Silver as ship's cook. His second mistake is to allow Silver a chance to recruit some of his old shipmates from his pirate days as members of the Hispaniola's crew.
TREASURE ISLAND is an excellent movie with plenty of realistic action and convincing settings. Robert Newton is brilliant as Long John Silver and Bobby Driscoll shines as young Jim Hawkins. A strong supporting cast includes Basil Sydney, Denis O'Dea, Ralph Truman, Walter Fitzgerald, Finlay Currie and Geoffrey Wilkinson.
Director Byron Haskins also directed THE WAR OF THE WORLDS.",1062115200,,958,4.8121212121212125
834389,5,6304293941,"This is the best version of Treasure Island. It doesn't exactly follow the book. In this version Long John Silver is more charismatic and lovable than in the book. The Jim Hawkins character has a sweeter, more lovable disposition. The extras of of Long John holding a knife to Jim Hawkins, Jim having to kill one of the pirates to save his life, and Long John doing what he can to save Jim gave it the extras the book didn't have.",1060214400,,430,4.320987654320987
834390,5,6304293941,"Robert Louis Stevenson's timeless tale of buccaneers and buried gold, TREASURE ISLAND was Walt Disney's first live action feature.  Shot in England in 1949 with meticulous attention to production design, the film has striking scenes reminiscent of N. C. Wyeth's great illustrations.  Wide-eyed, eager, and innocent Bobby Driscoll is a perfect Jim Hawkins and gruff, scary, and charismatic Robert Newton made stub-legged Long John Silver his own for all time.  Sadly, there are no extras of any kind on this disc.  The film has been restored (a few violent shots were cut in an earlier VHS release) and digitally transferred in its original, full screen, aspect ratio. It looks great.
It's hard to watch the naturalistic performance of young Driscoll and not be reminded that 20 years later he would be found in a filthy, abandoned tenement, his dead body covered with needle marks.  He was 32. He never recovered from the fame heaped upon him at such an early age. Treasure Island is a great film that honors Driscoll's memory and is almost true to the original story by Stevenson (there are some changes in the ending).  Recommended.",1053907200,4,1134,4.973544973544974
834391,5,6304293941,"There's no doubt about it-Disney's version of Treasure Island is a classic (particularly the iconic perfomrance of Robert Newton as Long John Silver, a role that people *still* identify as the quintessential pirate), and the restoration of this movie is pretty good, and that's why I've rated this disc 5 stars.
*But*, the extras stink. Actually, who am I kidding? There are no extras! None, not even a trailer (like the oldest Gold Collection releases even had). There's no mistaking that this disc is meant as a tie-in to Trasure Planet, but you'd think that Disney, which has gotten *a lot* better with its DVD releases in the last 18 months, would put out a disc with at least cursory features (trailers, a classic short, and maybe some vintage intro or something by Walt himself). Apparently, I'm wrong.",1052784000,83,808,4.86231884057971
834392,5,6304293941,"I have loved this movie since I was but a wee lad (born in 1967). I had the record LP as a child and still have the VHS tape. It remains to this day my favorite live action Disney film and the best pirate movie to date. Sadly,this DVD is a travesty!!! The colors are good but there is still lots of work to be done on it to call it ""fully restored"". Plenty of grain remains on the print.  And what's all this about no special features?!?! No 2nd disc?!?! This film is a milestone in Disney's history! Yet here it is treated as second rate! Nothing more than quick sell DVD to put on the same display self as Treasure Planet when it was being released to DVD. Now how about doing it right Disney and release this gem on Blu-ray, cleaned up real good and filled with extras. Do it like Walt was still in charge.",1051660800,69,809,4.088050314465409

834394,5,6304293941,The first and one of the best disney Films ever made. It is alot more exciting than the Wallace Berry one I personally think. It has better actors and I highly suggest it to anyone that wants to watch an adventure movie.,1041638400,,220,4.261904761904762
834395,4,6304293941,"There have been a vast number of versions of TREASURE ISLAND, and I am sure the future will bring a great many more, but this one remains the one to watch for one and one reason alone: Robert Newton. There have been many, many fine Long John Silver's, from Wallace Beery to Orson Welles to Jack Palance to Charlton Heston, but none of these others got anywhere near to the performance of Robert Newton. One of the great character actors of the forties and fifties, Newton isn't very well known in the United States because he did only limited work in Hollywood (even TREASURE ISLAND was filmed in England, not in the Caribbean or Hollywood). But fans of film will remember him in Sir Carol Reed's great film ODD MAN OUT (he plays an artist who wants to paint the dying visage of James Mason), in Coward and Lean's THIS HAPPY BREED, and an appropriately terrifying Bill Sikes in Lean's OLIVER TWIST. Newton was a glorious ham actor, in the best possible sense, and to watch him chew up scene after scene, always being over-the-top yet taking the part with complete seriousness. He is everything one can possible imagine in Long John Silver.
To be honest, apart from Newton's utterly dominating performance, there isn't much reason to prefer this version TREASURE ISLAND to any other. Apart from his Long John, the film as a whole is solid if unspectacular. While we have seen perhaps the finest Long John Silver we are ever likely to see in Robert Newton (who was so glorious in the role that Disney did both a sequel film and a television series featuring his Long John), we have yet to see the definitive film version of Stevenson's tale. The book contains darker elements than have ever been brought to screen. The 1934 MGM version (with Wallace Beery as Silver and Jackie Cooper as Jim Hawkins) is highly sanitized family fare, though it is perhaps the version with the best overall cast. It would, however, be nice to see an adult version of the tale, with all the darkness and complexity left intact. But even after that film does appear, this film will be well worth going back to just to relish Robert Newton's incomparable performance.",1033862400,11,2143,4.6569920844327175
834396,5,6304293941,"Robert Louis Stevenson's tale of treachery on the high seas comes to life in Disney's first fully live-action feature film, Treasure Island! The always wonderful Bobby Driscoll, Disney's star of Song of the South and So Dear To My Heart, plays young Jim Hawkins, the son of a local tavern keeper woman. The ocean brings all sorts of seamen into the tavern where the small boy lives and works, filling his head with ideas of adventure and excitement on the open sea. But fantasy becomes reality when a pirate treasure map comes into Jim's possession. Suddenly, he and his adult friends, the sensible Dr. Livesey and the pompous and careless Squire Trelawney, are planning there own adventure on the good ship Hispanola, in search of the treasure of the infamous Captain Flint. But before they can sail, they need a crew, and the foolish Squire allows their strange new friend, innkeeper and retired Navy cook Long John Silver, to sign one on for them. Long John quickly befriends Jim Hawkins and immediately gathers a crew, but rather than recruiting former Navy men as promised, Long John Silver hires on his REAL shipmates, PIRATES! Pirates of every shape and size! Soon, the crew of good guys, and bad guys in disguise, heads out to sea in search of Treasure Island. However, by the time they reach the isle, Jim Hawkins has overheard the mutiny Silver and his men are planning. Now it's good guys versus bad pirates in a battle over life, liberty, and untold riches! No one is sure of the outcome, but the real question is, is Long John really Jim's enemy, or his friend?
 No child should go through life without experiencing this Disney classic! Treasure Island is truly one of the best films to come out of Disney's wonderful vault. It's full of fun and adventure, with great characters and settings, a perfect mood, and a superb cast. Robert Newton OWNS the role of Long John Silver! There will never be another loveable villain like him! For more fun with Robert Newton in the role of Long John, search for the 1953 film ""Long John Silver Returns To Treasure Island,"" a sequel made by some other studio in an attempt to cash in on Disney's Masterpiece. Like I said, Robert Newton plays Long John again in that film, so for that reason alone, it's worth checking out. Also, pick up Muppet Treasure Island if you're a fan of Tim Curry and the Muppets! It's great fun!",1026864000,26,2372,4.6610978520286395
834397,5,6304293941,"Like so many adventure stories, there have been numerous film versions of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"". Walt Disney's 1950 live-action film gets my vote as the best version. Robert Newton, of course, steals the film as Long John Silver, but praise should also go to Bobby Driscoll as Jim Hawkins and the top-notch British supporting cast. This film has almost nothing that is mostly associated with Disney movies, including no songs or funny characters, but that doesn't bother me. I still love it, mainly because of the two main characters, Long John and Jim Hawkins, and the well-developed relationship they have.",993427200,13,629,5.176470588235294

The only thing in this movie that relates to the book or the other movie versions is the Title.

Half of the characters are missing. Much of the dialog is missing. The whole point of the story is missing. It was not necessary for the movie as other movie versions did not do this.

In an attempt to be cutesy Byron Haskin lost the mystery and the morals of Treasure Island. You definitely do not want to spend any money on this version (Bobby Driscoll)

A better choice is Treasure Island (1990) Charlton Heston, Christian Bale.

834723,5,6304293941,"While not 100% true to the classic novel, this version features a performance by Robt. Newton as Long John Silver that is absolutely spot on. All the performances are excellent, but I suspect Newton worked hard to capture the personality, mannerisms, and spirit of Long John. While the typical English pirate is now something of a comical figure (thanks Johnny Depp), Newton manages to shows us the malice that lies just below the surface of Long John's otherwise cheerful demeanor. Having read the book over a dozen times, I watch this film and marvel at how he simply inhabits the character. I would like to think that all the principals involved in the filming took their roles very much to heart, putting  on to film what is easily one of (if not THE) best adventure tales ever told. My grandsons, of the Star Wars/Harry Potter era, fail to see the magic made in this film, a sad commentary on how classic literature and its depiction on film are fading.

835043,5,6304293941,"In Disneys version of the classic tale by Robert Louis Stevenson, little Jim Hawkins mother is missing and hes running the Inn alone (maybe it was bingo night in town).  He has to contend with a Rum guzzling geezer (Finlay Currie as Captain Billy Bones) when an evil blind man shows up with the black spot and a warning.  Knowing the jig is up, Bones gives Jim Hawkins (Bobby Driscoll) a treasure map and tells him to run for help.  Help comes too late and still Hawkins mother has yet to be seen!  Apparently, they didn't have social services in 1765.  Seriously, should a kid that age be tending bar, serving liquor to miscreants and pirates?  Doesnt matter, soon Hawkins is off on a pleasure cruise with Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and Captain Smollett.  The crew is outnumbered by pirates passing for good honest seafaring folk.  A double mutiny puts everyone out of sorts.  And the treasure has already been filched by an old bag of bones craving cheese (Geoffrey Wilkinson as Ben Gunn).

A few liberties were taking with the story, but its Disney after all, and they were never hesitant to be unfaithful to great works of fiction.  Even so, this remains my favorite version of the story.  And Robert Newton is the quintessential Long John Silver.

Sadly, its impossible to watch Driscoll in this role without thinking about how the Oscar winning child actors life ended in 1968.  After voicing the role of Peter Pan for Disney, he was kicked to the curb.  He was unable to find acting jobs and said of his life at that point, I have found that memories are not very useful.

The characters are top notch with Robert Newton just about owning the role of Long John Silver.
The story if you don't know it by now is of Young Jim Hawkins, as played by Bobby Driscoll, gets a hold of a map of Treasure Island where all the gold and riches of a famous pirate was buried. He tells the master of the bit of land his family's inn was located on. Then under the guidance of Long John Silver learns a bit of sailing. A mutiny occurs when the ship arrives at the island because Long John is the long missing quartermaster of the famous pirate and wants the treasure for himself as well as half of the mutinous dogs that had made up rest of the crew. A bit of fighting and digging and the riches are found, pirates are defeated and Jim Hawkins goes home a little bit wiser and richer for both the adventure as well for the riches that were recovered.
This is well worth it if you have kids that are old enough to deal with some of the action scenes and some of the violence, not much and not much blood since it is from the 60's and it is Disney; but still tense and dramatic at points and really for 10 and up.",1455235200,4,1401,4.007142857142857

It made more silly departures from the book than the 1934 version, which clearly went out of its way to include details mentioned in the book.  I will say this though: the two main characters are much better in the Disney version.  However, Silver's accent is clearly affected (which is fine), but he takes it too far.  Really, ""Arrmen"" to close a prayer? ""Jim Arrkins""? That was a real head-slapper.

And what was up with the captain's wound?  He couldn't be injured in the course of fighting, no, it had to be a personal act of spite by Long John because he'd just lost the battle at the blockhouse.  Also, Ben Gunn was made into a buffoon.

People today have become so desensitized to violence on the screen that unless there are at least 100 or more people brutally murded, they feel it&s a boring movie.  A good pirate movie today is dependent on sex, heads and arms blown or cut off, people hanged by the dozens, and a dismal display of lack of respect for human life, dignity, and morality that Disney tried to instill in children movie by movie.

All in all, this is a very good children's movie that most adults can enjoy with their children.  It doesn't follow the book exactly, but what movie does.  It's close enough.  Everyone did a darn good job of acting all the way around, and when I was a boy, I loved this movie.

I still enjoy it today and watch it every so often mainly because the book is my wife's favorite book, and even though the movie isn't just like the book, she still really likes the movie.

Also, it's not that I'm just interested in old Disney movies with simple adventure.  We like all kinds of movies and our viewing is not skewed in any one direction.  I like this movie, and Disney did a great job bringing it to the screen back in 1950.",1345334400,,1339,4.402439024390244

The story begins along the west shore of England in the year 1765. A man enters a small inn and orders rum. Jim Hawkins serves him. Then he leaves hurriedly after seeing a chest. The Captain needs a big drink! Jim meets a blind man who has a message for the Captain: the black spot! The Captain takes a paper out of that chest and tells Jim to go and get help. Five men come ashore in a boat and search the inn. They flee when horsemen approach. The Captain is dead, they see Flint's map to buried treasure. Squire Trelawney plans to sail to this island, Doctor Livesey has questions (a rational man). The Squire hires a ship in Bristol, and a ship's cook. Long John Silver has one leg. He recommends a crew. Jim sees ""Black Dog"", who runs away. Jim learns to handle a pistol. Captain Smolett gives his opinion about what to do. Then they set sail and leave Bristol.

Silver makes `plum duff' for Mr. Arrow. Too much rum? The mate was washed overboard in the storm. Jim fetches an apple, and overhears a conversation. ""Land ho!"" Jim tells the Captain. Long boats tow the ship into the harbor. George Merry acts prematurely. Silver uses Jim as a shield. But Jim escapes when they reach land. He meets Ben Gunn who was marooned on this island for five years. [The isolation affected him.] Can Jim return to the ship? The pirates escape to capture the ship and hoist a black flag. The good guys are in the blockhouse, the pirates have the ship. Silver offers a deal but it is rejected. The pirates attack but are driven back. Captain Smolett is wounded. Jim sneaks away in the night and uses the small boat to return to the ship. He is threatened by a pirate on board but defends himself. The ship runs aground. Jim runs up the British flag.

Jim returns to the blockhouse at night and finds a surprise. The crew holds a meeting and deposes Silver. [Pirates practiced democracy and shared the loot.] Doctor Livesey treats Jim. The pirates follow the map. But the chest is empty! There is conflict that ends badly for the pirates. The good guys are back in control. But Silver has a trick to escape with some of the gold. Can his small boat reach Jamaica?

You can compare this to the 1934 version. I think this version was edited to remove some scenes. This 19th century story is about the dream of finding great wealth (unearned income). [""The Maltese Falcon"" echoes this story.] Bobbie Driscoll did not do well as he aged. In 1968 the NYC police found body of an addict. Later his fingerprints identified this person.
Robert Louis Stevenson's portrayal of Squire Trelawney mocks the inherited wealth of the land-owning aristocracy. The story does not tell what effect the sudden wealth had on poor Jim Hawkins. It might not be a happy ending.",1323388800,,2769,4.50996015936255

  But why don't i like this film? Simply because of the way they portray the story. When originally written, Treasure Island was meant to be , first and foremost, and adult adventure novel. I can hear the grumbling voices in protest already after writing that, but its true. Jim Hawkins is not capable, as a boy of 9-12, of making such adult decisions and performing such physically exhausting activities (ie. launching Ben Gunn's Coracle and paddling way out to the moored ship at night and all the brutal things that happened to him after that, like defending himself against Israel Hands. I could go on and on...). When you put him in the line of young adults, say 16-18, then you have more credibility in completing the hardships he had to go through. The kid in this version looks like a dumb overgrown mouse with bucked-teeth. He is so gullible and naive, its sickening. And the acting!!! Ha what a joke. If you want a real pirate movie, check out Frasier Heston's version from 1990 (recently out on DVD). In this one, you don't see sailors clean and neatly shaven. You do not see sliver with perfect teeth and clean fingernails.

836223,1,6304293941,"I had never seen this movie or read Robert Louis Stevenson's book, although I may have seen a different movie version and read the first chapter or two of the novel - both of which I forgot many years ago. A couple of days ago I found myself in the mood for a pirate movie and got this one from the library. There are classic movies about pirates, classic movies about deserted islands, classic movies about buried treasure. Unfortunately Disney's Treasure Island is not a classic movie if by classic you mean good or entertaining.

This is the most boring and stupid pirate movie I have ever seen, and one of the worst adventures I've seen as well. Watching this one thinks that Disney must ruin everything they touch, but try to remember that movies from the same era like Swiss Family Robinson and Davey Crockett were actually good. The actors in this movie are terrible - every single one of them manages to overplay and underplay their part at the same time. Long John Silver should be frightening and talk with a YARRR growling voice, but instead he comes off as a half-drunk Irish clown in training. The boy can't act either. The screenwriters and director completely butchered this story to the point where it doesn't make sense. The ocean and island both look like manufactured lots at Disneyland. The action scenes are hokey, but at least they show blood.

This movie is so boring that I kept falling asleep off-and-on through the last half hour. My fiancee only kept watching to get it over with. We both hated it. Painfully, dreadfully, excruciatingly boring film. Worst pirates ever. Veggie Tales ""pirates who don't do anything"" are cooler pirates. Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster missionaries are cooler pirates. Freaking Muppets are cooler pirates. These pirates all need to be keel-hauled.",1304467200,4,1812,4.823151125401929

836303,3,6304293941,"With Treasure Island you have to take the good with the bad. Being a Disney film from the 1950's the acting is served up with some thick slices of ham and most of the movie is clearly filmed on a sound stage. I would contrast this with the 2001 film Cast Away that was filled with stunning location shots on a remote island. The fact that it never feels like we actually leave the Disney sound stages does diminish the film for me but that is simply the way it was done back then. The centerpiece of the film is without a doubt Robert Newton as the one legged, parrot on his shoulder, Long John Silver. Newton has essentially become the template for the generic pirate and if you watch his acting now it feels hilariously clichd. After John Silver cleverly disposed of Mr. Arrow a eulogy was held and following the prayer Silver serves up an `arRRRrmen'. I couldn't help but burst out laughing but I wasn't laughing at the film but with the semi-unintentional humor. It's not Disney's fault that Netwon's portrayal made such an indelible impact on our collective psyche that his very speech pattern has become the model of a cartoon pirate. On national `Talk like a Pirate' people are essentially speaking like Robert Newton whether they know it or not.

The film itself didn't blow me away. I found it rather dated and hokey which was not unexpected when watching a Disney film that's nearly sixty years old. There was one fight between the pirates and the rest of the crew of the Hispaniola that gave me a chuckle when the filmmakers used the old chestnut of putting paint on a sword and running it down the bare chest of a pirate to give the less than convincing illusion that that man was slashed. Newton's scenery chewing acting is fun but other actors take it a bit over the top to the point of distracting. I have a feeling the young viewers will find the film a bit boring when compared to modern special effects laden films and I have to confess that even I found it a bit plodding at times. It's a fairly faithful adaptation although the ending was slightly altered. Long John Silver steals a rowboat and paddles off into the sunset which seemed kind of funny since I was always under that impression that Treasure Island was a long way away from mainland. Treasure Island is good for a viewing but for me once was nice and I don't feel the need to actually own it. I would defintely suggest getting the original Robert Lewis Stenveson classic book.",1246838400,,2459,4.501118568232662

836305,4,6304293941,"TREASURE ISLAND is a good example of Disney's way with live action when he began departing from his schedule of full-length animated features. His money at the time was tied up in the European market and he decided to make this version of the film in England with a splendid cast of actors and handsome use of Technicolor.

ROBERT NEWTON easily walks off with most of his scenes as Long John Silver, the man with the pegged leg and the parrot on his shoulder. Newton uses a malicious gleam in his eye to convey the cunning nature of his character but is usually a bit too theatrical to be completely convincing. Nevertheless, he's the focal point as far as the acting is concerned.

BOBBY DRISCOLL is very competent and well cast as Jim Hawkins and must have enjoyed the experience of working in a story like this with pirates and a stolen treasure map as major themes. He's fun to watch and inhabits the role with professional ease. No wonder Disney used him as the live action model for his PETER PAN, released a few years later.

Making a deep impression too is FINLAY CURRIE as Billy Bones, the man who gets his comeuppance early in the story. He gives vigor and flavor to his role, so much so that it's too bad his role couldn't have been expanded.

Treasure Island was released before another classic 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by four years but is classic story-telling at its best.  With their well-timed incidental music and Technicolor tropical scenery, Treasure Island delivers on almost every level.  Robert Newton's portrayal of the pegleg pirate Long John Silver is iconic and set the standard for buccaneer speech with his semi-Irish brogue until Johnny Depp started the Jack Sparrow staggering style in a recent Disney pirate trilogy. (I am sure you know of what I speak.)  Newton's Silver has been the gold standard that virtually all pirate actors have used, even the sea captains on TV's The Simpsons and Family Guy.

Perhaps the only detraction I can offer is the scrunched face of actor Bobby Driscoll, whose facial contortions as young Jim Hawkins fill me with concern that he is in desperate need of a trip to the toilet.  It is unfortunate that, despite his success as Peter Pan three years later, he died an unfortunate death alone and broken.

836440,5,6304293941,"Disney has always called on classic stories for inspiration.  Robert Louis Stevenson's great classic ""Treasure Island"" provided the inspiration for this Disney adaptation.  The adaptation deviates from Stevenson's and becomes a classic separate from Stevenson's.

Young Jim Hawkins (the late Bobby Driscoll, who appeared in ""The Fighting Sullivans,"" ""Song of the South,"" ""So Dear to My Heart,"" and was the voice of Peter Pan in the Disney classic) encounters pirate Captain Billy Bones.  Bones is an imposing figure, and yet he is kind to Jim Hawkins.  Soon, other, more vicious and threatening, characters appear on the scene, all looking for Billy Bones' treasure map, which is now in the possession of Jim Hawkins.  One of those of these characters is Long John Silver (the late Robert Newton, who also played Mr. Fix in the epic 1950's classic ""Around the World in 80 Days"").

Jim Hawkins is now caught up in a series of events over which he initially has little control.  A group of men decide to pursue the treasure shown on the map, and they decide to take Jim Hawkins aboard as a cabin boy.  Jim is our observer throughout this tale, and we see many of the events that transpire through his eyes.  Thus, we gain knowledge of an impending mutiny and come to realize how vicious the pirates masquerading as crewmembers are.

The excitement and action increase when the pirates mutiny and everyone searches for the treasure.  Jim comes into his own as he realizes that he is the one person in a position to make thing happen, if he only dares.  Though Disney modified many things from Stevenson's story in this adaptation, Jim Hawkins' coming of age story remains relatively intact.  We also learn why Long John Silver is beloved by all who have seen this classic as we see his vicious side and the care and concern he has for Jim Hawkins.

I remember seeing this story decades ago as a young child.  The violence in the movie (though there is minimal blood) seemed normal for a pirate movie.  I also thought little of the drinking and smoking that occurred throughout the movie.  Watching the movie as a parent, I was a little surprised at the violence, drinking and smoking that occur in this movie, but I also realize that I survived seeing all those things and, more importantly, I remember my enjoyment of the movie as a child; i.e., for those of you who think children should be protected from these images, get a life.  Pirates drank, were violent and smoked.  Disney managed to keep the rough stuff to a level that achieves a PG rating.  If you object to drinking, smoking and violence in real life, then use this story to help explain why we do not do those things.

I do consider this movie a family movie, in spite of my comments above.  You may wish to wait until the youngest in the family is 7 or 8 years old, just so that you can explain the effects of alcohol and smoking and that life in that era was very different from our life today.

Disney's version of ""Treasure Island"" is a grand classic.  The movie does mute some of Stevenson's morality tale and does remove much of Stevenson's characterizations.  These changes were necessary to adapt Stevenson's classic to a 96 minute film.  In spite of those changes, ""Treasure Island"" survives as a marvelous coming-of-age story that is both entertaining and inspirational.  My children loved this movie when they were in elementary school and I suspect yours will too.

836443,2,6304293941,"An English Teacher's review.  To my fellow educators:

I have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of ""Treasure Island.""  I've seen the version with Charlton Heston, the one with Jack Palance and the 1950 Disney version.

It is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of ""Treasure Island"" has apparently not yet been made, as all three were so abysmally bad that I was unable to finish them.

What no director has yet come close to capturing, is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds, and the simple directness of Stevenson's 19th century morality tale.  Without exception, all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as Wythe.

Again and again with each film, someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by Stevenson apparently wouldn't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen.  What I really want to know is if any of these directors actually READ the book, or had a personal relationship with it?  I find it hard to believe that they did, since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is.

Jim Hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn, when the Captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of ""a seafaring man with one leg.""  The Captain should be tall, mysterious, powerful and terrifying.  In two of these films, he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director's sister.  It only gets worse from there.

The tragedy of the Captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but Stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the English oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum, terror and stroke.

The Captain's fate - to fall dead of a ""thundering apoplexy"" on the floor of the inn, forshadows the essential purpose of Stevenson's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death.  In the guise of a boy's adventure story, Stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power.  His pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted.  They are not caricatures.  They are not the wax mannequins of a Disney ride; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts; even with regrets.  They do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it, gritting their teeth against the death, (from violence, sickness, treachery or rum,) that is always staring them in their faces.  Jim Hawkins' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust.  It is no accident that, despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party, (led by Captain Smollett,) it is still only Jim Hawkins' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from ""death at the hands of the pirates.""  Stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to ""be like the little children in order to be saved.""

To tell this story properly, it must be told absolutely straight, and with the same committed earnestness with which Stevenson tells it.  None of these films is that brave.

To make a film that is faithful to Stevenson's moral, the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined.  Those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice.",1164931200,14,3807,4.737481031866464

Robert Louis Stevenson's pirate story _is_ a children's fantasy. (Stevenson - whose grandson would later become one of Disney's ""house directors"" -- says as much in the book's introduction.) The principal characters are well-drawn and believable, but the story is 98% adventure. There is no _dramatic_ thrust to events. And it's told from the view of a 20-year-older Jim Hawkins, which tips off the reader that Jim is never in any real danger.
The emotional focus of the story is Jim's attraction to / repulsion by Long John Silver. In the novel, the adult Jim briefly acknowledges that he was attracted to Long John Silver as a surrogate for his recently deceased father, but turned away, because Silver is plainly untrustworthy. Stevenson fails to develop the relationship any further.
Not the screenwriters -- they bring it front and center. The story is now properly focused where it should be -- can Jim _really_ trust Long John Silver?
Silver is also worried about Jim, who plainly doesn't need ""Piracy for Dummies"" to recognize Silver is not altogether on the up-and-up. In a scene not in the book, Long John attempts to sweet-talk Jim -- one might even call it a seduction -- ending with the presentation of his parrot as a gift. The effect is subtly erotic -- especially as the gift comes from someone with such an obviously phallic name. (One is tempted to think Stevenson's name choice was deliberate -- he must have known how cabin boys were ""mistreated."") And though Silver is married in the novel (to an unseen wife), the movie leaves his marital status unstated.
Long John Silver is a morally ambiguous character, and the film plays up this ambiguity. Silver alternates between protecting and threatening Jim, and you believe his sincerity in both instances. At the end, Jim is forced into deciding whether he should let Long John escape or be turned over to justice, completing the film with a solid dramatic ""bang!"" (The novel simply peters out -- Silver is taken captive, later wandering off with some of the loot.)
Robert Newton's interpretation of Long John Silver has always been controversial. There's no question it's totally ""over the top."" But that's how we expect pirates to behave, and it's how Stevenson wrote the character. I've seen ""Treasure Island"" several times -- Newton isn't simply chewing the scenery. His is a conscious interpretation, and he's in full control at all times. It's a great performance.",1085097600,8,2620,4.956818181818182

But the entire mood of this film rests on Robert Newton's inspired ""Long John"".  No other portrayal of a pirate has influenced more actors than Newton's, and his characterization has become the stereotype of every pirate performance ever since.  Even a bit of ""Long John"" filters into Newton's portrayal of ""Mr. Fix"" in Michael Todd's ""Around the World in 80 Days"".
One important note: The cinematographer on this film was Freddie Young, who would later win Oscars for his camera work in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", and ""Ryan's Daughter"".
Though this is a Disney film, there are some moments which may be a little too violent for younger children, hence the ""PG"" rating.  Far better for Disney to give us the complete movie as originally filmed than to whack the print with a cutlass.
A must for any collection of seafaring flicks.",1074211200,,1124,4.833333333333333
836475,5,6304293941,"Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure tale comes magically to life in this excellent production.  Robert Newton gives the performance of his life as Long John Silver, the scoundrelly pirate captain who heads up the most likeable group of rascals and rogues that ever belted out a chorus of ""Fifteen men on a dead man's chest, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.""  Bobby Driscoll, who tragically never was able to make the jump from child to adult star, is excellent as Jim Hawkins and the supporting cast is very good indeed.  But this is Newton's movie.  Hamming it up delightfully from one scene to the next, he walks off with the film.

The movie strays from the book in a few places, most notably in the end; but when we see Silver sailing off into the sunset, cackling wickedly after appropriating all the loot, we feel somehow that maybe this is how Stevenson should have ended the book.  Disney's ""Treasure Island"" is a treasure in itself.

836476,3,6304293941,"Billy Bones, an old, scarred sailor arrives at the Admiral Benbow inn, where Jim Hawkins works. Billy Bones fills Jim's ears with stories of the open sea and warns him to be on the lookout for a one-legged man. Some of Bones' former shipmates appear and give him a slip of paper with a black spot on it, terrifying the old man. Bones dies of a stroke, and Jim escapes with his treasure map as the other sailors polish the inn. Jim takes the map to Dr. Livesey, who forms a plan with his friend Squire Trelawney to sail after the treasure, which was buried by the pirate Captain Flint.
  Jim travels to Bristol to meet up with the ship, the Hispaniola. In Bristol, he meets the ship's cook, Long John Silver, a one-legged man who recommended many of the ship's crew to Trelawney. Despite Billy Bones warning about a one-legged man, Jim is won over by Silver's friendly charm. Then, after an uneventful voyage, Jim is on deck one night and overhears Silver plotting a mutiny.. While on the island, Jim sees Silver kill a sailor who won't join the mutiny and meets Ben Gunn, a marooned sailor who lives on the island. Meanwhile, Dr. Livesey, Squire Trelawney, and the others leave the ship and find a stockade on the island, where they settle in for a fight.
  Under Captain Smollett's command, they endure the pirates' first attack. Jim arrives at the stockade and joins the defenders. The pirates storm the stockade, and several men are killed and Captain Smollett wounded in a bloody battle.
After anchoring the ship in a new place to fool the pirates, Jim returns to the stockade, where he is captured by Silver's men (this is the climax of the story). Silver tells Jim that Dr. Livesey and the others agreed to give the pirates the stockade and the treasure map. (Dr. Livesey did this because he discovered that Ben Gunn had already dug up the treasure.) Silver lets Jim live when Jim promises to testify for him if the mutineers are caught. The pirates set out to look for the treasure, but find only an empty hole. When they turn on Silver and Jim, Dr. Livesey, Ben Gunn, and another loyal man ambush the pirates and drive them off. They rejoin the captain and Squire Trelawney, who are waiting with the treasure. They sail back to England, but Silver escapes when they land in South America.
The theme of the story is the victory of good over evil. Saving the treasure from the hands of the pirates and their safe return also records Jim's journey from an immature young lad to a responsible youth.",1066176000,2,2503,4.5432372505543235
836477,5,6304293941,"What can  you say about a classic like Disney's Treasure Island. Robert Newton absolutely owns the role of Long John Silver. What a performance! Sure the rest of the cast is so-so, but Newton earns my five stars for them. Tim Curry was excellent in the Muppet version, but I'll still vote Newton the top honors. He just made my skin crawl.
