1946359,5,B0000UJFBK,"If Wembly stadium doesn't prove Genesis' appeal, then I don't know what does. This is just another great concert from a group, of which there will never be another group alike. Much better video quality than on the original VHS.",1076371200,,228,4.725
1946360,4,B0000UJFBK,"If you are a fan of the some of the best hits of the 1980's, you'll love this concert. It has a nice balance of some of their well-known radio favorites - such as Invisible Touch and Land of Confusion - with some of Genesis' best known 1980s 'long songs' - Home By the Sea and Domino. Coupled with the live instrumental 'Brazilian', this concert has something for everyone.
The collective skill of the bandmembers is outstanding, demonstrating Genesis' musical talents and skills: Chester Thompson shows why he was one of the best drummers in the industry; Daryl Steurmer's versatile work on both the bass and electric guitar; Mike Rutherford's classic rock style on the lead guitar; Tony Banks' unmatched work on an entire assortment of keyboards; and Phil Collins belting songs like 'Mama' - then taking his place behind the drum kit.
An outstanding musical performance - not to mention the other aspect of live Genesis - outstanding light shows.
This concert was excellent in person - and this version of it is the next best thing...",1075939200,,1036,4.825842696629214
1946361,4,B0000UJFBK,"I'm a Genesis fan of both eras: Gabriel's and Collins'. In the concerts I like when the band plays the old songs too. The selection of the songs of the Invisible Touch Tour for the DVD (obviously doesn't contains all the songs of the real concert) from my point of view wasn't the best. In the documentary included on the Special Features, Collins mentioned that they played Supper's Ready (but it's not included on the DVD). Man, you can't do that !!!. I love that old songs. If they decided not to put that one on the DVD (may be because is too long), don't mention that on the Extra Features!!!. They leave you like ""they what?? They played that one?? How in the world the editors...? How could you...??"". I'm looking forward to get the DVD (once it's available) of the Mama Tour (that one includes for example ""In the Cage""). I'm also waiting for ""Three Sides Live"" and ""Seconds Out"" on DVD. That would be great.",1072656000,4,916,4.458333333333333

1946368,5,B0000UJFBK,"Love them or hate them, Genesis was a force to be reckoned with back in the day. I'm a child of the 80's and some of my earliest musical memories are of the album Invisible Touch, so when I got this DVD it was amazing to see one of my favorite rock bands of all time in a live setting performing some of the songs I've loved for almost 30 years now.

Like some folks have commented, the editing work on this concert video can be a little jarring at times (just too many cuts too fast), but the sound quality is excellent and the range of visuals of the musicians at work is quite excellent.

If you have any love whatsoever for Genesis, Phil Collins, or 80's synth/pop/rock in general, you definitely need to watch this.",1398988800,2,720,4.248175182481752

1946378,4,B0000UJFBK,Most would appreciate success of one of their favourite groups. Its just so sad to see this and what could have been. The disappearing support had already begun before this. In taking the band in this direction creativity has suffered in the same way Pink Floyds creativity suffered. That is not to say these men are not skilled but of course BIG BUSINESS is simply Too Big and requires insational amounts of money to supposedly satisfy.,1350345600,,437,4.7631578947368425
1946379,2,B0000UJFBK,"I just sat down and watched this DVD which is part of ""The Movie Box"" DVD set that I bought.  The production and sound seem very good but I first watched the Tour Documentary in the ""Extras"" section of the DVD.  In this documentary Phil Collins talked about the fact that they are playing songs on this tour written as early as 1973, including the last portion of Supper's Ready--footage was even shown.  Well I don't like to look at the setlist on the DVD before watching to keep the element of surprise as if ""I were there in 1987.""  Well, they never did play the old medley of songs on this DVD!!!!  According to Wikipedia, it was editted out of this DVD!!!!!  The Medley evidentally included In the Cage, In that Quiet Earth/Afterglow and the ending of Suppers Ready.

This show has way too much of the post-Duke material and perhaps only Los Endos from pre-""Abacrap"" days (Oh yeah, Turn It On Again from Duke is the encore--a low-light from the Duke album.  What a sad show to see what was once a band at the forefront of progressive rock music descend into being just another commercial pop band laughing their way to the bank while leaving their long-time devoted fans depressed.  Tony Banks hardly does anything impressive  although I do like ""The Brazilian"" a lot.  Why Mike Rutherford is playing lead guitar when Daryl Stuermer is on-stage is baffling.

Had they included the medley of old songs I would have given this DVD a 4 star rating.  But NOT including it is CRIMINAL!",1306972800,2,1485,4.558490566037736
1946380,4,B0000UJFBK,"Considering this was filmed in 1987 the audio is quite good.  The video isn't anything special, but you have to remember how long ago this was filmed.

The documentary on the disc is fun as well to follow the band around in their 80's heyday.",1303948800,,242,4.355555555555555
1946381,3,B0000UJFBK,"This concert from Wembley in 1988 left me with mixed feelings. I've seen this show before in a later incarnation. The sound is pretty good but the video leaves a lot to be desired. It's dark for one thing and the lighting is not all that good for the cameras. There are too many quick shots of the individuals in the band. But the band is tight and Mike, Tony, Daryl, and Chester all deliver the goods. Phil is an irrepressible knome, chatting with the crowd and in general, acting weird but engaged and friendly. His singing is great as usual. As a point of fact, Genesis never made it to the really big time until Phil more than capably took the reins from Peter. However, there are better DVD's to buy than this one. The set list is good:

Mama
Abacab
Domino (Part 1. In The Glow Of The Night)
Domino (Part 2. The Last Domino)
That's All
Brazilian
Land Of Confusion
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight
Throwing It All Away
Home By the Sea (with a long, bizarre introduction by Phil)
Invisible Touch
Drum Duet ( I usually hate drum solos but the coordination between Phil and Chester is something to cheer about)
Los Endos
Turn It On Again (medley, same as Knebworth with pretty much the same intro)
Do The Neurotic

1946382,3,B0000UJFBK,"I have had this awhile and watched it once thinking something was amiss.  I have it on VHS also so I just assumed it was out of sync on that originally so I didn't think anything of it; until this evening.  I put the DVD in and realized very quickly that the audio was out of sync with the picture.  The audio being out of sync; even by a fraction of a second, is inexcusable in my opinion.  I took it out and put in my original VHS and it was the way it was supposed to be.  Im quite upset by this because I do not know if it would even be worth it to replace it and I would rather not pay for it twice only to get the same problem possibly.  So, I guess I am stuck with this.  There is one other review on here of another expressing the same problem and my copy does exactly the same thing that he describes in his review.  Basically, it is terribly noticeable during the first 5 songs or so.  The weird thing is that once you get past that and on a rare occasion before that, there are times when it seems to get back in sync and then gets out of sync again.  It is very strange.  I think this is probably more widespread than it appears to be.  My wife initially did not even notice but it is there.  My suspicion is that this may affect all copies.  It is kind of a blink and youll miss it; hit and miss kind of thing throughout but again when compared to the original VHS, the problem becomes apparent and sticks out like a sore thumb.  Somebody did not do their job for this.  If you can stand watching this with sync problems bouncing back and forth, then by all means pick up a copy.  If you have nothing to compare it to, like the VHS, then you won't really have a problem with it at all.  It is watchable but there are sync issues.  The best way to experience this show thus far is the VHS original from 1988.  I sure am glad I kept mine.",1236297600,2,1849,3.959349593495935
1946383,3,B0000UJFBK,"This past year has proved to be a banner year for Genesis. With a smash reunion of the three parts that have defined the group as one, Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks coming together as one in nearly 15 years. There massive performace all across Europe and the U.S. really did a great service of reminding how potent and strong their music has still delivered over the years. Not only by their performances, but with the recent re-release of their albums like Invisible Touch, We Can't Dance, and Duke to just name a few. But, when Live In Rome came out, it really delivered a cavalcade of classic Genesis songs that are strong and proof of merit. But, back in 1986, Genesis proved that theory with a big performance, but on video that is just a sad land of confusion.

Genesis: Live At Wembley Stadium, is a showcase of one of their biggest concerts of that era. The video shows Phil and company performing songs from their Invisble Touch album, which basically is most of the DVD alone. The songs have been remastered well within the performance, as you hear classic songs like Throwing It All Away, the haunting Domino Parts 1 & 2, and the deep and driven Mama. While the performance is good, I really don't hear a lot more than mainly their 80's songs on this DVD. I really find it a bit dissapointing that they did not perform great classics Genesis has been known for like Afterglow, Abacab, and Duchess. That alone leaves a bit of a weakness. The extras don't also bring in too much to make up for the flubs, by showing a documentary about the tour, and a photo gallery.

All in all, I was hoping that Genesis: Live At Wembley Stadium could've brought down the house heart and soul for many hard core fans. It still misses the mark with better live DVD's like the recently released When It Rome, which sadly is only available at Wal-Mart, or Phil Collins 2004 Final Farewell Tour DVD showed. Still, if you haven't heard any of the Genesis greats' of the 80's era, than this is one you'll say In Too Deep too.

1946384,5,B0000UJFBK,"Excellent, excellent concert.  Phil, Mike, Tony, Daryl, and Chester were spot-on in this performance.  Also a good back stage interview in which Mike reveals that Daryl is the better musician (which everybody could tell by performance).

If you're a Genesis fan, you will not be disappointed by this incarnation of the band.

1946385,5,B0000UJFBK,"I caught a show on the American leg of this tour, all the way back in `87 - I remembered the great production values, but had forgotten what fantastic voice Phil Collins was in at the time! He's one of those singers who (like Rod Stewart), because of the texture of his voice, people don't realize what a range he has. Also, he AND Genesis are not so ""in vogue"" anymore, most likely due to overexposure in the `80s & `90s... I'm glad that I didn't hold that against the boys, because this is one of the finest concert DVDs that I've seen.",1202169600,2,538,4.233009708737864
1946386,1,B0000UJFBK,"This DVD should have been called the ""It's all about me: Phil Collins show"".  See Phil drum.  See Phil chat up the audience.  See Phil do a lousy cover of Mick Jagger.  For those who still remember the question on the average Genesis fan's mind in the 70s; ""who really is the creative heart of the group genesis?"", this DVD makes it clear its certainly not the remaining members of Genesis.  Just compare the musicianship and stage presence of Peter Gabriel in something like the DVD ""Growing Up Live"" and you'll understand.
The sound quality is muddled but passable.  The setlist disappointingly shallow.  The video editing mediocre, particularly on the last few songs.  By the standard of something like ""Eagles: Farewell Tour 1"" this DVD doesn't measure up.",1191888000,3,760,4.8828125

1946388,5,B0000UJFBK,"This is Genesis in England on the Invisible Touch tour. I have been to a lot of Genesis concerts, so this movie is a much different perspective on a show. Lots of close ups, and no idiots sitting two rows back screaming  all the time. I played this with the home theater surround sound and the audio was great. This was almost as good as being there: no lines in the restrooms, smoking is allowed, and it cost less than 20 bucks. I plan to get more concert DVDs.",1187827200,,462,4.191011235955056
1946389,5,B0000UJFBK,"Despite being one of the best live bands in music history, few documents have ever been prepared on the event that is a Genesis concert. We all know the brilliance or their studio work, but it isn't very often that we have seen Genesis live, available for commercial release. Out of their nearly 40 year career, Genesis could have released a dozen films or documentaries illustrating their concert environment.
So this, the first official live footage released to the public, is a must have. Though the entire concert(s) that took place back in 1986 is not provided here, over an hour and a half of Genesis satisfies even the more devout fans well enough. There is a documentary to go along with the concert and a photo gallery of the ""Invisible Touch"" tour program is also included. The Documentary, especially, is somewhat humorous.
The picture quality and sound reproduction is fantastic on this DVD. All of the songs that are included greatly depict why Genesis was one the world's leading acts in the late 70's and through almost the entire 80's decade, even into the early 90's.

I saw the Invisible Touch Tour twice in person, but the venues I went to in the Los Angeles area were no match for Wembley Stadium. Wembley was the perfect place to record this show. Once again, Genesis displayed their superb musical skills and amazing theatrics. The band was in top form here. Genesis was always a band that could effortlessly blend sound and visuals to create a unique concert-going experience. They were so far ahead of their time in that regard.

This video snapshot shows the band at the height of its pop apogee with a dose of the strange beauty that only true purveyors of music can appreciate.

This was a phenomenal tour but, just like every other tour dvd, the entire show is featured.  What is shown is incredible mixture of pop and rock.  Regardless if you liked the album invisible touch this dvd shows the extent of the genesis musicianship.  There is 2 forms of genesis.  There is the studio side and there is the live side.  2 very different bands.  This dvd caputures genesis at the height of their popularity and musical ability.  the dvd has great acoustics and has multiple sound options for you.  Listen to the guitar work on los endos.  Phils drum work is incredible and he uses a mixture of electric and acoustic drums on this tour just like the 1984 tour.  The lighting is quite interesting too.  Genesis is the first band to use an entire set of vari-lights which didn't require dry ice for optimal illuminationand could work durring the day.  This was a great tour and this wembley section was a 4-day, 300,000 people event.  Also, it's interesting to think about how busy collins was at this time.  He was touring and producing with clapton, he had just finished all his no jacket required tour and had worked with sting, gabriel, and live aid.  incredible time for him",1129680000,30,1363,4.635983263598327
1946403,5,B0000UJFBK,"DTS Sound = EXCELLENT

Picture quality = Good

Concert - Excellent

First let me say that the 5.1 DTS mix is with out a doubt, about the best I think I have heard.  Nick Davis did a fantastic job on this.

Secondly, the picture quaility is not excellent, but is good for what its worth.  The reasons for the picture quality is a couple.  At the time when this was filmed, they used state of the art High Definition - Analog cameras that only held 1 hour film reels.  We are lucky that this even exist on DVD.  There is quite a story behind the band borrowing a Sony HD machine, only one of four ever made and hardly in existence.  The picture quality had to be compressed (I believe) from the HD source so there is some loss.  Plus, as the night falls, those particular camera's didn't do real well in low light conditions so it is obvious that the picture isn't as good as the concert goes on.  I actually wish that the concert was delayed a few years and hoped that the High Definintion would reach HD DVD's, and then to the market place.. that would've been a real treat.  Also, it is nice that this is in widescreen be default.

Lastly, I think no matter what you like or dislike about Genesis, this is a good setlist from the 80's primarily.  They are very energetic and put on a great show.

Now, one reviewer already posted but some overlooked this:  That is that the In The Cage medley was infact played at Wembley, all four nights in a row, to all 70,000+ each night.  However, the band decided that the camera should get the film reel's changed at that point in the show so they didn't have to take a break, and the entire show minus the ITC medley would fit on two reel's per camera, hence cutting costs down on filming the show.  The thought was that why film it when it has been filmed several times before.  It is unfortunate, but done.  My opinion is that this is very much worth the $10 that Amazon is selling it for!",1125964800,9,1933,4.241095890410959
1946404,5,B0000UJFBK,"I am a huge genesis fan: gabriel, collins, wilson...it doesn't matter the band is excellent.  I hesitated to buy this DVD as I perceived it was filmed during the highly commercial '80's.  Honestly, I bought this because I spend $9.99 on a 12 pack and that only last a weekend!  I will enjoy this dvd for many years.  The extras were an bonus.  The quality in my opinion is as good as current dvd's.  They do do alot of cuts, but there is more to the band than Phil Collins.

Second, the editing is two rapid- cut to Phil, cut to Tony, cut to Chester, cut to an audience long shot: very 80's MTV.

Fine show, despite the fact that their best show for me is Seconds Out (witch contains the best Supper's Ready version I've ever seen in my entire life but it doesn't have in a DVD version), but if this is their best show, so Live At Wembley Stadium is for sure their second best! I'd like to complete my collection with a DVD version of Seconds Out and I expect in the future they release some show from the Peter Gabriel era in DVD (how about the entire The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway live version guys?), meanwhile, I can watch Genesis in their mullet-period with Daryl Stuemmer and Chester Thompson blowing away classics like Abacab, Mama, Domino, Throwing It All Away. The show also includes Home By The Sea and a fine version of Los Endos, 70's Genesis, and the ambientation makes you travel back to the 70's!' But the final session of the show is awesome too, after the classic Turn It On Again they started to medley with classic rock anthems like Pinball Wizard, (I Can Get No) Satisfaction, (Reach Out) I'll Be There, and many others.

I was blown away by the concert, especially the Drum Duet/Los Endos portion of the show (I play drums).  Seeing it on DVD reminds me of how much I liked the Invisible Touch album, and how much Genesis, despite their success, where still very much a progressive band (note I didn't say Prog).  Seeing them in the live setting underscores this point.  Plus, it's funny to think that Mama, Abacab, and Tonight Tonight Tonight were hit singles when you realize that these songs are all a minimum of 6 minutes long.  Phil Collins has always been a huge drum influence of mine, and he truly shines on this DVD.  I love the setlist for the show, but I wish the old medley from this tour was included as well.  I can do without In Too Deep, but the In the Cage/In That Quiet Earth/Apocalypse in 9/8/As Sure As Eggs is Eggs medley would've been a nice inclusion, especially as a counterweight of sorts to the somewhat plodding old medley on the Way We Walk DVD.

The concerts in the 80s and 90s were lively and fun and this DVD is a great presentation of that period.
There are some great songs on this DVD. The recording and camera work are excelent also.
You can not deny theat Tony banks is a great musician and composer. Phil collins has a lot of presence (and fun) on stage.
By the way Glen, Daryl is a great musician too.  Check out his playing with Jean Luc Ponty or his solo work (yes, he does compose.) Chester is also a very acomplished drummer and plays on Steve Hacketts Tokyo Tapes DVD (I am watching it right now - all I can say is WOW).

I would like to see more Genesis DVD's be available in the future {""Three Sides Live"" and ""The Mama Tour""} and also a documentary on the whole history of the band and last but not least a video collection cause Genesis is a band that definitly deserves a video collection.",1081555200,2,924,4.435294117647059
1946421,4,B0000UJFBK,"I'm an obsessed Genesis fan from way back.  I first saw this performance on VHS in 1987 and have since found it to be a favorite concert of mine.  But, I always felt the sound on the VHS was lacking depth.  Well, they fixed that with this DVD release!  I do not have a 5.1 system, but even on a 2 channel system, the 5.1 mix is superb.  The sound ranks up there with the sound on the Roxy Music ""Live At The Apollo"" DVD.  As others have noted, it is a superior concert to the ""Way We Walk"" DVDs.
So, why only 4 stars?  Well, it's not perfect because the ""In The Cage/In That Quiet Earth/Apocolypse in 9/8"" medley is not here.  It wasn't on the video either, but I figured certainly they would include it on the DVD.  Nope.  Ah, but aside from that ommission, it is the best Genesis concert video yet available.  I don't even like the ""Invisible Touch"" era that much, but these live versions are quite good.  And they fixed the sound problem with ""The Brazilian"" (on the VHS version, the moment in the song where it's just the 2 drummers, the sound is noticeably quieter than the rest of the song -- it's all been fixed).
Highlights for me:
""Abacab"" -- best live version of this song I've heard.  Ramped up some and not as tired as the version on ""Three Sies Live"" (1982).  I hear this and I remember why I was so smitten with this band.
""The Brazilian"" -- This is one of Tony's best songs and, while the version here shows little change over the album version (some solo drumming), it's still great to see this song performed live.
""Domino"" -- A better performance than ""The Way We Walk"" DVD and more energy than the album version.
""Home By The Sea"" -- there are actually a few great versions of this song live around, but this one is perhaps the best played.  There are parts during the second part that have me aboslutely mesmerized.  When Genesis gets to this state, they approach Pink Floyd-type aweness.  A drooler song for those of us that enjoy this artsy stuff.
""Drum Duet"" -- best drum duet that Collins and Thompson have done.  Phil still had speed in 1987.  This is one of the only drum solos I know of that has an actual melody and form -- not just some wiz-bang show-off stuff.
""Los Endos"" -- not to sound like a stuck record, but this is probably the best live version of this song I've heard.  When Mike gets to the ""Dance on a Volcano"" riff and the band builds to the ""Squonk"" theme, it is goose-bump inducing.  And the power they deliver on the ""Squonk"" theme makes me wish that they'd do the whole song!
Well, I've gone on long enough.  I hope the release other live shows (1976 with Bruford please!!).",1081123200,7,2620,4.3040816326530615

Even though Genesis never got the recognition in the last years of the band (Ray Wilson is a brilliant artist that most of America missed out on because of their poor taste and lack of interest) that they, more than anyone else, deserved. Genesis literally changed my life as a musician during the seventies and they opened-up my tastes to many more musicians and styles of music.

Sample, for instance, ABACAB which is powerful and rythmic. It rocks.  The long songs namely Domino and Home by the Sea are played with great energy and vigor and reminds you that Genesis is more than a prog band gone pop.  No, circa 1987 they jam!!
The sound is pretty good given its age;so no complaints.  Likewise, the picture, in widescreen, is pretty decent with minimal blurring and edge enhancement issues.
The only minuses is that this DVD caters to the casual Genesis fan and takes out the classic stuff save for Los Endos.  Gone are the likes of Supper's Ready and In the Cage.

1946425,5,B0000UJFBK,"There are generally considered to be three eras of Genesis--1) the Peter Gabriel pushing the creative envelope ""all five of us"" era, 2) the ""there's still the other four of us"" transition, and 3) the commercially successful, radio-friendly Collins/Banks/Rutherford era.  Fans are divided--some like the old, some like the new.  I like both.  This concert, from July of 1987 captures the band during the commercially successful Invisible Touch Tour, at Wembley.  The setlist is comprised primarily from Abacab, the Superfection album, and Invisible Touch.  If you like these albums, this is a great concert video.  Most of these songs could be heard on the radio back when stations played album-oriented rock.  The songs are performed well, the band sounds nice and tight--more so than on the ""Way We Walk"" cd's and DVD.  Furthermore, the camerawork is nice--smooth transitions from camera-to-camera, with nice sweeping crowd shots, etc.  Songs include: Mama, Abacab, Domino Pt. 1, Domino Pt. 2, That's All, Brazilian, Land Of Confusion, Tonight Tonight Tonight, Throwing It All Away, Home By The Sea/Second Home by The Sea, Invisible Touch, Drum Duet, Los Endos, Turn It On Again medley.

1946426,4,B0000UJFBK,"I'm going to assume that, if you're reading this review, you're already (at least) a casual Genesis fan, so I won't bore you with a band history.  ""Live At Wembley"" is a much-anticipated DVD release, because it's been very hard to get here in the States.  (Europe has had theirs for months, but they're DVDs don't play in our players)  I had the pleasure of seeing Genesis on this tour six nights in a row at the Oakland Coliseum, so watching this DVD brought back great memories of a dazzling light show, great performances and excellent sound.  Considering how bad most concert footage was in the early to mid-'80's, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how clear the picture quality is.  (Compare it with their previous concert tour video from the Mama tour, still available only on VHS and you'll see what I mean)  It should be noted that the VHS version of Invisble Touch concerts also looked far superior to anything else on VHS at the time, but I digress.
My only beef with this release, and the reason I give it four stars and not five, is the omission of their ""In The Cage"" medley, which on this tour included the closing of ""Supper's Ready"".  Why leave it out?  While the VHS version may not have had enough room, surely the DVD could fit it all?!  There's a brief documentary added on the DVD, and the band members mention their inclusion of ""Supper's Ready"" in their set, yet it's not actually shown.  This may be minor to some, but this DVD shows Genesis in all their ""pop"" glory.  (Genesis fans debate the worth of the music from this period, but I love it all!)  Still, I would love to have a visual document of Genesis doing something from their ""early days"", even in medley form.  Rumors run rampant that videos of earlier tours will someday reach us via DVD; one can only hope.  Still, if you saw Genesis back in '86-'87 and remember having a good time, this will be a great reminder.  It's certainly worth adding to your library.",1080086400,2,1946,4.504273504273504
1946427,3,B0000UJFBK,"After I had heard that Genesis was finally going to be releasing this concert on DVD, I was really looking forward to purchasing it.  They are one of my favorite bands ever, and even if the ""Invisible Touch"" era was a little too commercial and drum synthesized for my tastes, I still wanted the DVD for several reasons;  I saw the band on this tour at Three Rivers Stadium; I own the VHS copy of this concert so I knew ( or thought I knew) what to expect; and finally ""The Way We Walk"" DVD was absolutely phenomenal, especially since it gave you the multiple camera options.  From a strictly musical review standpoint, I certainly would have liked to have seen them include more of their older material (i.e. ""Supper's Ready) in the DVD release.  But aside from that, the concert performance in itself is outstanding.  From a technical point of view as far as how the show was filmed, it is a great example of how concerts should be filmed.  Plenty of multiple camera angles with a nice mix that include full stage shots; close-ups; side stage shots etc.  It is easy to watch and you get a nice overall view and impression of the concert;  not like many of the poorly filmed concerts these days with directors that assume that everyone has a 2 second attention span and constantly change shots; or directors that shoot close-ups of the singer's head or face for half the show (i.e. Bruce Springsteen Live in Barcelona).  No, this concert was filmed and edited very well.  The sound mix is also very good (unlike the recent ""Rush in Rio"" DVD disaster).  So what is my criticism?  It is the one thing that I will never understand.  How in the world do you release a DVD with THE SOUND OUT OF SYNC WITH THE PICTURE!!?  Doesn't anyone notice this in the editing room?  I couldn't believe it when I watched this.  The sound is about a fraction of a second earlier that the video.  It is most noticeable through the first five or six songs, it is especially noticeable on ""The Brazilian"".  The second half of the show doesn't seem as bad.  Certain shots are in sync; others are horribly out of sync.  Mind you, it is only a fraction of a second, but that is still bad enough to ruin, or at least make a lot less desirable the viewing pleasure.  I can't believe no one took the time to fix this, or how this was released this way.  With a little more care and effort (fixing the sync problem and including the full concert), this could have been a great DVD.",1076457600,5,2451,4.412026726057906
