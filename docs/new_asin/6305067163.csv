Also the little songs that people used to sing in days gone by, to help them remember how to do their jobs.",1155081600,,268,4.702127659574468
7902294,5,6305067163,"This is the only film I have seen which features oxygen closed circuit rebreathers, similar to those actually used in WWII. The story is about the Italian 10th Light Flotilla and their attacks on British warships in Gibraltar's harbor and the British counter attacks. It tells the first part of the military history of Cdr. 'Buster' Crabb, GM, and his efforts to fight the then unique underwater operations. It deviates from the book of the same period (Commander Crabb), but it is a must see for sport and military divers interested in the history of diving.
(The Tenth Light Flotilla, with only 6 frogmen, sank two British battleships in Alexandria Harbor. The British attacked and sank the German battleship Tirpitz in a somewhat similar fashion, but that is a different story.)",1013644800,7,781,4.969465648854962
