43182,4,0783211201,"There is much to commend ""Crooklyn"".  Each shot is composed with a level of craftsmanship and creativity approaching Hitchcock, and the rich  visual ideas just keep coming at you.  In particular, I loved how the glue  sniffers moved along the sidewalk upside down to suggest their state of  mind, and the way the whole Maryland episode was shot in a smashed-in  distored fashion to underscore that it was ""squeaky clean""  suburbia that was stifling and strange (and thus potentially damaging) to  little Troy, not her crowded Brooklyn neighborhood.  And what's nice is  that these visual ideas don't exist is a vacuum, but are housed in a  genuinely good movie.  The episodic story is funny, touching, involving,  and rings true from start to finish.  The movie also has what must be the  funniest sight gag involving someone opening a sofa-bed in the history of  movies.  But to say more would be a crime-- see it for yourself!  And, rest  assured, you'll enjoy the rest of ""Crooklyn"", too.",966988800,6,991,4.86144578313253
43183,5,0783211201,"Nine-year-old Troy stares in astonishment at the spectacle before her.  The Puerto Rican shopkeeper is dancing sensuously with a transvestite.  As they bump and grind, she leans against the deli case, mouth agape in  fascination.  The cashier speaks impatiently to her.  ""Okay, okay,  keep your shirt on!"" she says, not taking her eyes off the strange  couple by the dairy case.  ""Gimme two sticks of licorice, some  lemonheads...""
Introducing Troy Carmichael, the pluckiest,  scrappiest bundle of brains and mouth and bones you'll ever meet.  She  fights a protracted, sneaky Dirty Little War with her oldest brother  Clinton.  She wrestles boxes of Trix cereal from her no-good brother  Wendell.  She skips rope with the girls, eats ice-cream on the stoop of the  ramshackle, delightful brownstone she shares with her family and a boarder  (her hero) who is gentle to her.  And she evolves into an astute observer  of humanity and--as the result of a family tragedy--a responsible  woman..just like her mother.
Whoever cast the astonishing Zelda Harris  as the indomitable Troy should get an award.  This little girl is  mesmerizing to watch; utterly natural and completely believable.  You drink  her in.  She's the daughter you'd want.  She's the kid you wish you had  been.  She can lay you flat with a look and a twist of that mouth.  And  Spike Lee coaxes a remarkable performance from her as he leads us through a  series of vignettes in a summer on the Block with her family, friends,and  the myriad neighbors around them.
The critics seem to think Crooklyn is a  well-intentioned but meandering mess.  I utterly disagree.  Troy's world is  filled with the little steps in time that make up a life.  Her parents  fight--and briefly separate--not over grand infidelities but instead over  money and family management. She's frightened by, and later triumphs over  the encroaching glue-sniffers on her block.  She makes an enlightening  journey into Darkest Maryland to visit her bizarre Aunt Song and her cousin  Viola (""Don't worry,"" says Viola, rolling her eyes.  ""I'm  adoped."").  And Spike returns her to her kitchen which, with a  resigned air, she finally cleans up.
Not one note in this quiet film  rings false.  Not one scene is staged or dishonest.  And everything has the  look and sound of the Seventies.  A glorious soundtrack brings it all back.  I grew up 3000 miles away and white, but I, too, sat on the bed fighting  over the Partridge Family and Deputy Dog and Soul Train with my siblings.  I found myself warmed clear to the bone by this gentle setpiece.
Spike  Lee is a genius who has made more ""important"" films than this  (the remarkable and disturbing Do The Right Thing is now part of the  western film canon).  But as a mother, I find Crooklyn to be ultimately the  more profound film. Little Troy takes on the mantle and role of her mother  not through harrowing cliffhangers and a histrionic plot but through the  quiet everydayness of little gifts of love from her family and  neighborhood.  It's Spike's Gift of Love to us.  If we're smart, we'll take  it.  Gratefully.",959558400,5,3106,4.887596899224806
43184,3,0783211201,Delroy Lindo&Zelda Harris Steal The Movie. Alfre Woodard is Good in this Film About Middle-Class African-American Family Life in the 70's. The Music feels So Good to the Soul&the Vibe is their.but after a while  much was the un-doing of Girl 6 is the same with this film the Music goes  from going with the film to being One Long Video to Great 70's music.,955152000,3,356,4.461538461538462
43185,5,0783211201,"This movie alone justifies why Spike is one of the best directors out there.  I love the camera tricks he uses during certain situations in the stories. Particularly when the vertically stretched screen was used as  little Troy was staying at her aunt's house, showing the situation as  awkward in more ways than one.  Crooklyn, in my opinion, did the best job  to capture the look and the style of the seventies. The story..the actors  and actresses..I loved it all.",951696000,,467,4.775
43186,4,0783211201,"This is one of the most overlooked films of recent memory.  No one mentions what a great performance Zelda Harris delivers.  If Tatum O'Neal can get an Oscar for Paper Moon, then this child certainly deserved at  least a nomination. Alfre can do no wrong in my book.  A very tender and  heartfelt movie - for the whole family, regardless of your ethnic  background.",948931200,9,365,4.625
43187,5,0783211201,"Being a huge Spike Lee fan, it means much when I say that ""Crooklyn"" ranks very high, just beneath ""Do The Right Thing"" and ""Malcolm X"".  Naturally, this coming-of-age  family comedy set in Brooklyn during the 70's obviously has a strong  autobiographical slant to it (the screenplay was written by Spike and two  of his siblings, the story itself was credited solely to his sister, Joie),  but if you've read Spike's out-of-print diary of the making of his first  film ""She's Gotta Have It"", then you get an even stronger idea of  how personal this film is to Spike; the Clinton character is obviously  molded after him.  The acting, cinematography, cultural references, music  and acting are all superior.  Most creative was the debut of Spike's  ""slimmed-in"" cinematography during the Virginia sequence, which  would soon become a Spike Lee trademark.  Fans of Delroy Lindo who haven't  seen this film will be surprised with his gentle & sensitive  performance.
I'll tell you why this film has such a profound impact on  me.  I, like many others, have seen hundreds of films set in different  times, places, etc.  But very few films have been able to transport me back  to another time & place as effectively as ""Crooklyn"".  For  the duration of the film, I really feel as if I'm enjoying an intimate  portrait of a working-class black family in Brooklyn during the 1970's,  it's like I'm right there.  The irony is, I'm a middle-class white boy from  Chicago who was born in 1974.  This film is a grand artistic & personal  triumph for Spike Lee.",944524800,30,1550,4.787072243346008
43188,5,0783211201,"Anyone who spent most of their childhood in the 1970's will truly apprciate Crooklyn.  I related to everything in this film.  From buying candy at the corner store, watching the Partridge Family and going to visit  relative down South.  Spike Lee truly makes you think an appreciate your  youth.",930268800,3,295,4.938775510204081

Five kids and a mom and dad, one a young girl named Troy, are a family. The lively life of the street from the front stoop, where interaction with the neighborhood happens, rings true. Each day has a dependable sameness for Troy until her mother, the glue that holds them together, faces serious illness. This is one movie that deserves to be among any list of classics.

I don't understand why people like it so much.  I don't get the narrowed cinematography sequence.  I felt like I was just watching some random family and the father was ignorant, stubborn and lazy, in my opinion.  I guess this was basically Spike Lee's childhood.  So, I think that I can understand WHY he made the film.  But it did not speak to meat at all.  If the film was supposed to be a view into a very average Brooklyn family (and community) in the 70's, then what is the point?  There could literally be hundreds of thousands of films like this, for the rest of the Brooklyn families.  In summary?  Meh.",1455494400,,783,4.429577464788732

If you also purchase this DVD, please don't think it's defective when the family takes Troy down south for a stay and the whole time she's there staying with relatives. The screen will be stretched vertically, but it's supposed to be that way during Troy's stay in the south. Troy is the only girl in her family and has four brothers. They live in an apartment building in Brooklyn. It's a coming of age story mainly about Troy and she is forced to grow-up much faster than normally.",1448755200,,562,4.574257425742574

The family Troy stayed with were very gracious to Troy who was determined to not let go of her Brooklyn attitudes.

It remains a very charming, but bittersweet look at urban life for a black family. The actors were excellent, and I especially love Alfre Woodard's performance.  Parents, it has a lot of drug references and a main character dies from cancer. I actually don't like any of Spike Lee's movies, other than When the Levees Broke.",1414972800,,461,4.8354430379746836

44278,5,0783211201,"Ahhh who can forget the good Ol' days of Spike Lee films that had heart as well as insight? Who can forget this gem?
Crooklyn is loosely based on Spike Lee's life growing up. Its mostly a story that mostly details the struggles of a family growing up in Brooklyn as seen through the eyes of Troy(played by Zelda Harris). There are beautiful performances to be seen here. Alfre Woodard's presense is felt as the stern but loving mother of four kids and Delroy Lindo's is great as the father who is also dealing with pressure as a struggling musician and trying to pay the rent on time. They go through the normal strife that any black family has to go through in poor areas but they still find a way to maintain. I remember as a kid that the last scene with the mom passing on had me choked up. Troy and her brother holding hands at the reception for the funeral was a touching scene too. They drove each other crazy but it was still love in the end. Crooklyn has brief moments of awareness like one scene in particular: Troy's aunt comparing troy's hair to her adopted child's hair saying that the adopted child's hair was good hairnad that Troy's hair was rough was a sublte form of self-hatred but most people wouldnt pick up on that. Of course Spike Lee has to make an appearance in the movie. He plays a junkie who chases kids around trying to steal money from them. In short Crooklyn stands out as one the best dramas of all time and one of Spike Lee's best work. The characters are ones that you care about, their struggles are real and anybody who has been there can also relate. Two thumbs up for Spike Lee's work of art on film.",1217808000,,1637,4.318181818181818
44279,5,0783211201,This is a wonderful movie.  My favorite from Spike Lee.  It tells an autobiographical story about a mother dying from cancer and its effect on the youngest girl in the house.  It uses a lot of fun techniques to create a nostalgic mood for the 1970s and offers differences between urban and suburban African-American lifestyles in a hilarious comparison.  The movie has quite a bit of love in it and that carries the story above and beyond the usual family history movie.  The girl's impression of the local drug addicts are hilarious.  They are seen as crazies who are harmless but still scary to young children.  The father is a jazz musician who makes a varied amount of money that the family can't depend on so the mother's loss is felt even more acutely.,1208390400,,758,4.611940298507463
44280,4,0783211201,Crookyln involes Spike Lee's trip down memory lane and it's a memorable one. The cinematography and script are all excellent as always and the soundtrack represents the seventies very well. The film's only down point is that it's a bit long but still a great heartwarming film.,1206489600,,277,4.914893617021277
44281,5,0783211201,This has been my favorite movie since first seeing it when I was nine! I love it and make any of my friends who hasn't seen it watch it. Such a classic!,1194134400,,152,3.78125

44283,4,0783211201,"This Spike Lee joint tells the funny, but also sad story about life growing up in Brooklyn in th Early '70's through the eyes of a no-nonsense mother, a struggling-musician father and their 5 children.  The music of that time was great and you get to hear some of it throughout the movie like The Stylistics, The Staple Singers & Aretha Franklin just to name a few.  Also, clips from nostaglic commercials and TV shows like The Partridge Family and Soul Train (the first season) are also featured in this story that makes this movies worth watching.

And I think the formula used for CROOKLYN may have been some sort of inspiration for the 2002-2005 NBC show AMERICAN DREAMS since they were both produced by Universal Pictures.",1176422400,,727,4.708661417322834
44284,5,0783211201,"The movie was awesome. It had a great story line. Also it takes you back to the late 70's and the early 80's. Spike Lee definitly did a good job with the clothing, the scenary, and the music. It is a great family movie.",1176249600,3,219,4.0
44285,5,0783211201,"The first time I saw this film, I was at my aunt's house. Each character had their own uniqueness, especially Troy. I loved her. The film is one of those timeless classics. Growing up in Brooklyn, this has to be one of my favorite  films. I was born in 1982, but the film still resonates with me, because it shows me how life was back in the 1970s. Spike Lee, when is Hollywood going to give you an Oscar?",1172534400,7,405,4.1265822784810124
44286,4,0783211201,"Another wonderful film of Spike Lee's.  Reminiscent of ""Do The Right Thing"" with the neighborhood flavor, odd characters, a richness of detail and editing.  But expecting it to be funny and light, I was disappointed.  The family was always fighting and Alfre Woodard always yelling at her sons.  I do have trouble with that.  But they all seemed to love one another and the episode of Troy with her southern aunt was very well done, except for the odd way it was filmed.  And the little girl who played Troy was effective in her role.  Woodard is a truly gifted actress.  I've liked her in everything she's been in.  She should've gotten an Oscar for ""Passion Fish"".  It never ceases to amaze me  - the range of films that Lee has made.  All of them good; most of them exceptional.  Only Woody Allen comes close to such a body of work.  Lee's characters are just so believable in their humanness.  It's like you're looking into their lives and troubles and joys.",1144627200,2,962,4.543859649122807
44314,5,0783211201,"As you can see, I loved the movie. I think, for the people who did not enjoy it, it was more of the fact that they didn't understand it or were too critical.

My father grew up in brooklyn in the 70s and when I was younger he shared his love of music and stories of his childhood with me. As a result I could really relate to the setting of the film. I did not try to find the deeper meaning of this story. I felt it. I saw a girl, in the short period of a season, learn about life and how it always moves on. I could relate to her family, immediate and distant. I could relate (because of my father) to the way life was back then (though it really wasn't that long ago.)

I loved every second of Crooklyn and it's beautiful soundtrack. You may not, so don't feel disappointed if you don't...this is only my opinion.",1135555200,5,816,4.030864197530864

It reminds me so much of my own personal life it was scary. All these people who didn't like the movie are too focused on the unimportant facts of a movie and not looking at the movie itself. It has alot of truths in it and I think it is well worth th time and money to explore it and figure out where it parallels your life.,1098835200,23,564,3.622950819672131

It's my personal favorite- and if pop culture got a hold of it, I'm sure they'd feel the same.",1029715200,2,263,4.076923076923077
44343,5,0783211201,"This film is probably one of the best films ever produced from an autobiographical point of view.  It's depiction of the 70s and the world through the eyes of a child is so well crafted that you ""lose"" yourself in this film. It literally transforms you and takes you back to this time and you totally relate to the experiences, the love, the anger, the joy, the sadness that exists in this family.  Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo give performances that are just too good to put into words.  But, folks, the work of the young actress who is at the center of this movie is absolutely astonishing.  She is completely believable and in my opinion born to play this role.  How they found her just goes to prove that probably the strongest talent that Spike Lee has, among his many, is his ability to cast his films.  This little woman steals the movie from every accomplished actor/actress in this movie and I can't imagine it having worked without her.  This is a must see film and should be watched when you have some quiet time and want to relax and enjoy a good, heartwarming, film about love, family, triumph and tragedy, friendship, and above all, youth and innocence.  A brilliant film.",1024444800,7,1188,4.570754716981132
44344,4,0783211201,"""Crooklyn"" is a nostalgic story of the ups and downs of an African-American family living in 1970's Brooklyn . It is probably the second best movie that director, Spike Lee has ever made. Lee's best was the classic 80's flick ""Do the Right Thing"".But while ""Do the Right Thing"" was about ethnic tensions, racism and strife, ""Crooklyn"" is a film about love. In the movie we meet the Carmichael family. They yell, scream, call each names, even get into physical fights. But it is very evident, that love is very strong among this large brood. Dad (well played by Delroy Lindo) is a musician who is trying to create some honest music thats important to him. Mom (fabulously played by Alfre Woodard) is pulling her hair out, trying to keep this inner city family's finances above water, while trying to stop the kids from killing each other. But the film really centers on 9 year old Troy (Zelda Harris) who shows us the ins and outs of her family life and the close Brooklyn neighborhood that she is growing up in. Juvenile actress, Zelda Harris gives us an amazing starring performance that is totally believable. The movie is pretty much autobiographical (Lee wrote it with his sister Joie)and it richly lays on the 1970s nostalgia with cultural references among other things to ""Soul Train"", the ""Patridge Family"", Walt Fraiser, and baseball stategamatic. The film also has a wonderful soundtrack which is packed with '70s R&B and pop music from groups like the Jackson 5, the Spinners, Curtis Mayfield, the Staple Singers and Sly and the Family Stone. In fact, my favorite part of this movie is the opening credit sequence, where you hear Marc Dorsey's ""People Make the World Go Round"", while the film shows us the neighborhood's children playing various sidewalk, kids games. Between Soccer practice and video games, do kids even do this anymore? I just love this movie and I highly recommend it!",1023753600,11,1898,4.825153374233129
44345,5,0783211201,"This movie will take you ""Back Down Memory Lane.""
I grew up during the 70's and this movie hit home to me 100%.  The sound track alone will sell you on the movie.  Spike Lee as well as ALL the characters in this movie will allow those who did NOT grow up in the seventies to know what the experience was like.  The young girl in the movie is a STRONG actress and carries her role as the ""MISS KNOW IT ALL"" sister in the family while each of the brothers give her a hard time.  It is up to the sister to keep the family together in the time of crisis.
Much love SPIKE for bringing this time period in the lives of African Americans to the big screen for those to enjoy!",1017964800,4,668,3.962686567164179
44346,1,0783211201,"This movie has no point. It is a series of random events that sometime relate to one another.  The acting was descent, but the lack of plot nd story made the movie annoying to watch. You will find yourself waiting for the movie to end and then wishing for it to do so.",1017878400,4,268,4.056603773584905
44347,4,0783211201,"I was upset to see the not-so good editorial reviews that were given for this movie. I think that this movie is great and that the reason that Spike Lee directs it as he does (that the editorials led to believe as being confusing or going nowhere) is because it is supposed to be from a little girls point of view. A little girl who is going through a lot in her life from annoying brothers and friends to separation of family and learning about things like drug abuse from people on the street. Not to mention that she is growing up fast. Anyways this is a great movie with all the elements of being funny, sad, and nolstalgic of the 70's",1005091200,4,639,4.245901639344262

44350,5,0783211201,I am sorry I waited so long to watch this movie. Spike Lee brought me back to my child hood when I lived in Crown Heights and East New York Brooklyn. There wasn't a single scene in the movie that I could say was far fetchec or not authentic. I highly recomend this movie to anyone who feels nostalgic about growing up in the 70's. Its funny how things come full circle. I remember as a child being told about the good old days and now I see myself saying the same thing to the younger generations.,987897600,4,497,4.134020618556701
44351,5,0783211201,"Crooklyn is Spike Lee masterpiece that has been overlooked when compared to other works by the revolutionary filmaker.  Along with Malcolm X and Do the Right Thing Crooklyn delivers. The captivating storyline takes you right back to the days of your youth. Spike Lee draws you in with a storyline that we can all relate too whether it is the constant bickering between siblings, the father that is is down and out of a job and the mother who struggles to provide for her family.  Crooklyn will surely touch your hear with the story of ladybug and journey into becoming a young woman. Set during the seventies this is definately a trip down memory lane that is worth the trip.",979430400,,675,4.616666666666666
44352,4,0783211201,"Troy is a bright, beautiful little girl growing up in a fairly large family in Brooklyn.  She is delightfully brash and original, traits she  undoubtedly inherited from her indomitable mother.  Her gentle father, a  musician, is a soft hearted dreamer who leaves the more practical aspects  of family living such as guidance, business issues and discipline to the  no-nonsense mother.
Troy gets a taste for life outside of Brooklyn when  she spends part of a summer visiting an aunt and uncle who live out of  state.  Their adopted daughter, raised as an only child, teaches Troy some  of the finer points of independence -- Troy does not have her brothers to  rely on with this family.
Matters come to a head when Troy's mother dies.  Her father and other concerned neighbors help keep the family together in  a pinch and it is Troy herself, the bright, beautiful little girl who  really radiates hope throughout this ordeal.",967766400,,926,4.852564102564102
