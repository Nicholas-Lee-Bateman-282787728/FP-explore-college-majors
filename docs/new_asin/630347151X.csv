669057,5,630347151X,"I've just finished reading John Toohey's book on the journey Captain Bligh and his fellow Bounty exiles made across the Pacific Ocean (""Captain Bligh's Portable Nightmare""). Rather than focus on the ""men of  Pitcairn Island"" this film focuses on the story told in Toohey's  book-- the amazing 4,162 mile journey Bligh and his men made across the  open sea in a 30-foot launch and the subsequent investigation by the  British Admiralty.
The book and the film agree on most points. The film  stars Mel Gibson as Fletcher Christian, the wonderful Daniel Day Lewis as  Mr. Frye, Liam Neeson as Mathew Quintel, and other now famous young actors.  I hope the film is released on DVD --SOON!",958089600,4,684,4.844827586206897
669058,5,630347151X,"""The Bounty"" is an excellent, well-made movie with a great cast.  For the first time, Capt. Bligh is depicted as a reasonable, intelligent (if hot-tempered) man who was wronged by his crew.  This movie version of  the Bounty mutiny is the most historically accurate yet made, and it ranks  with the 1935 Gable/Laughton version in terms of quality entertainment.  The 1962 Marlon Brando version is a joke by comparison.  I must say that I  disagree with several of the reviewers who blasted the 1935 movie: it may  have had  historical inaccuracies, but it too was a tremendously  entertaining film.",956361600,2,598,4.94949494949495
669059,5,630347151X,"Finally a film that does justice to this compelling story.  One could not ask for more talent with a cast that includes Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Liam Neeson, and Daniel Day-Lewis.  The  characters are fleshed out in a believable way.  Gone are the prissy  affectations of Brando's Fletcher Christian and the cartoonish buffoonery  of Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh.  Anthony Hopkins makes the character  of Captain Bligh much more human.  He is actually a regular person, if a  little misguided, who watches his crew become intoxicated by the beauties  of Tahiti.  Vangelis' soundtrack is marvelous, he really creates his own  atmosphere that totally complements the film.  This is the definitive  version of this saga, don't miss it!",949622400,9,766,5.266666666666667
669060,5,630347151X,the scenery alone in this movie is so wonderful.  photography is exquisite. i own this movie and highly recommend it for a sunday-afternoon-curlup-on-the-couch movie.,933206400,,166,5.916666666666667
669061,4,630347151X,"""The Bounty"" is the story of one of the most famous incidents in maritime history.  For anyone who isn't familiar with it, this particular movie is, perhaps, not the best way to begin that knowledge.  Yet, it has  some of the better characterizations and cinematography which have been put  on film since John Ford left us.  Sir Anthony Hopkins is, as ever,  excellent as Captain Bligh: seeking to do his duty as the British Royal  Navy deems necessary.  His epic open boat journey was a triumph of  seamanship and well deserving of the filmtime devoted here.  Mel Gibson, as  Fletcher Christian, is a young man attempting to come to terms with his  life while learning command seamanship from his older friend, Bligh.  His  performance is, at times, wooden and completely unemotional - just as are  most very young men.  At other times - again, just as other young men - he  lashes out at the overbearing authority-figure in his life.  Only, this  time the lash has the effect of changing not only his own life but the  lives of every other man on the ship.  Mel Gibson may not be the definitive  Fletcher Christian but he most emphatically DOES give one of the more  riveting screen portrails of a torn and ultimately doomed man.  Watch this  movie again and learn to know the inner man as well as the mutineer who's  actions eventually changed the policies of the British Royal Navy itself.",914716800,,1393,4.652892561983471

669158,5,630347151X,"As a lover of British naval history, this is by far one of the best films I have seen about the mutiny on the H.M.S. the Bounty in 1789.  It accurately depicts the harsh conditions faced by seamen during the Age of Sail such as the claustrophobic conditions on the ship, lack of sanitation, crude foodstuffs, drunkenness, heavy, stormy seas, tensions between the sailors, corporal punishment, hostile native islanders, and politics amongst the officers.  This combined with shots of the Sun setting on the ocean and a haunting soundtrack make it one of the great cinematic experiences of the 1980s.",1510272000,,598,4.97

669237,2,630347151X,when under pressure mel reverts to his 'insane' role he's known for.  there was entirely too much sex and suggestive sex in too long dancing on the island.  There was too fast a twist in Bligh's character to one of decency to all out tyrant.  the ending was BAM and over.  It started out with the court room scene and should have ended there.  there was a complete shallowness into any other cast members that made the story float on the surface without any depth to it.  This made me not care about any character in the movie.,1508198400,,527,4.326530612244898

669240,3,630347151X,"It was a good movie, but I much prefer the older version Mutiny on the Bounty with Clark Gable. I feel like this story was told from Captain Bligh's perspective and he seemed somewhat reasonable as a captain. The older version is told from Fletcher Christian's perspective, so you can really see how cruel the Captain was. The intro dragged on for a long time. It was a good movie, but I don't think I will not be watching again.",1504742400,,429,4.375

Two separate commentary tracks, both of which are equally insightful, Vangelis' exquisite ethereal score is given an isolated track (in 5.1), and the picture resolution is about as close as you can get to 4K w/o actually being 4K. This film fires on all cylinders, breathtaking cinematography w/o the use of CGI, costume design, a cast to dream of, including a very young Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson, and of course, Anthony Hopkins. This film couldn't have been made at the current asking prices these actors are getting today (Lewis has since retired).

669418,4,630347151X,"I think there are four or five movies depicting the Mutiny on the Bounty. This movie suggest at least one reason for the mutiny was all the time the men spent in Tahiti screwing the women there. They just didn't want to leave. It's is good an answer to the question as any.

 As movies go it's an entertaining movie and I don't really care whether it's an accurate depiction of what happened especially since we really don't know. The official histories tend to support the idea that Bligh was more or less blameless.

 The movie is rated PG. I would call it a hard PG. There is a fair amount of naked female breasts to be seen along with some vicious fist fights among the crew and various assorted corporal punishment of the crew. Probably not something you want a young child to be watching.

It is not a perfect movie but I found it entertaining and that's what matters",1473552000,,873,4.39751552795031

669494,5,630347151X,"The film adapted from 'Richard Hough's' book 'Captain Bligh & Mr Christian' which tells the story of the
famous mutiny on the 'H.M Armed Vessel Bounty' in the late 18th Century by it's crew led reportedly by
'Fletcher Christian' (Masters Mate)
The story is told from flashbacks during a court-martial proceeding at Greenwich by defendant 'Lieutenant
William Bligh' (Anthony Hopkins) commander of The Bounty on it's ill-fated mission to acquire Bread-Fruit
Plants from 'Tahiti' and deliver to 'Jamaica' (believed a cheap alternative for feeding the slaves)
The 'Bounty' set out on it's epic Voyage on the 23rd December 1787...'Lieutenant Bligh' has it in mind to
fulfil an ambition to circumnavigate the globe which would involve rounding the often treacherous seas of
'Cape Horn'
As was feared by many trying to navigate 'Cape Horn' would prove almost impossible so much so they would
have to add several months to the journey by changing course.
They finally arrive in 'Tahiti' in October 1788, their planned spell on the Island becomes extended by some
four months due to the 'Bread-Fruit' taking longer to grow and be ready for shipment than expected, along
with the Winds being adverse for the continued mission.
During these months the discipline of the crew members were becoming of concern to 'Bligh' including that
of 'Fletcher Christian'(Mel Gibson) who had taken a wife, the island's King's daughter 'Mauatua' (Tevaite Vernette)
When it became the right time to leave the island many crew-members including 'Fletcher' were reluctant to
leave the scantily-dressed and eager to please native girls/woman behind.
'Bligh' decided almost immediately that he had to re-install discipline on board, his methods becoming increasingly
more violent.
When his eagerness to complete his ambition to circumnavigate the Globe by returning to Cape Horn became
apparent..this would be the last straw for many of the crew who turned to 'Fletcher' to assume command of the
Vessel....the love-struck 'Fletcher' would not take too much persuading.
'Lieutenant Bligh' and the few loyal to him would be set afloat in the ships 'Boat' with minimal supply's to embark
upon a seemingly impossible attempt to find safety.
'The Bounty' set sail to return to 'Tahiti' ....though they would find themselves unwelcome on their return.....
of course if 'Bligh' did find safety it would be the first place the mutineers would be sought.
Several of the woman including 'Fletcher's' native-wife would leave 'Tahiti' with the Mutineers on the Bounty in
search of a safe-haven.
A slightly different and perhaps more colourful telling of the story than the Marlon Brando film of the story from
1962.
The film boasts a host of well known stars such as 'Laurence Olivier' - 'Daniel Day-Lewis' - 'Liam Neeson' and 'Edward
Fox'
This is a lavish production, a film i've been meaning to re-visit for may years...well worth the visit in my view.
The sequence attempting to round Cape Horn dramatically convincing...
The DVD picture Quality is pretty good....though on reduced screen dimension to normal viewing expectations.

669790,4,630347151X,"Bounty was a refined telling of the original story. Far kinder to the Captain (Anthony Hopkins) than most depictions. Mel Gibson was solid and restrained in his portrayal of Fletcher Christian, not quite the firebrand one would expect in a man proposing mutiny. He was more of a victim of unrequited love caught up in a tide of crew unrest sweeping him into the position of mutineer captain. It just never quite felt like his heart was in his decision to mutiny. His heart was driven by love and the vision in his mind of a life free from the constraints of the British Navy. Such a desperate action had to require more of a desire for power and influence than was evident in this portrayal. Still, a story well told with breathtaking seascape.",1467936000,,744,4.559701492537314

Bounty from Commander (not Capt.) Bligh in the late 1780's. All the living witnesses and participants were interviewed. What emerged was a documented and very different tale from the fictional one we're used to.
First off, Bligh and Christian were long-time friends who had sailed together before, and Christian owed Bligh 50 pounds (equivalent to about $6,000 in today's money). He had incentive to take over the ship. It's an amazingly authentic film, and the performances by Gibson, Hopkins, Day-Lewis and others are superb.",1466726400,,695,5.27027027027027

Of all the movie treatments of the mutiny on the Bounty, this is the truest to life, presenting Capt. Bligh in a somewhat more favorable light, and calling into question the actions of Fletcher Christian.  Filmed on location in Tahiti, the score by Vangelis at first seems a bit out of place, but in the final assessment, I think it works.

671193,4,630347151X,"I think I am the only one that has never seen Mutiny on the Bounty before, but I do know the basics of the story thanks to History class. So when I saw ""The Bounty"" when I did a search for movies with Anthony Hopkins in it I decided to give it a shot.

I really enjoyed the movie. I could not possibly say enough good things about it. The scenery was breathtaking. I think it was well written and I think that Hopkins did a good job as the Captain. Mel Gibson, for some reason did not impress me in this, even if he is sexy, I can't put my finger on why I was not impressed with his performance, but I was not.  If I would have liked Gibson in this movie it may have received a 5 star rating from me.

Since I have never seen the original I cannot compare the two.

It was not a waste of my time to view this movie.

My reviews are my opinions of the movies I have watched and just my opinion. Everyone is different and could have a different opinion of a movie. How boring would life be if everyone had the same opinion of every movie?

Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Please consider following me here on Amazon for other reviews. Thanks and have a blessed day.

672038,5,630347151X,"This remake of the original Mutiny on The Bounty is well done and captivating in mho is best of the three.  The movie is adapted from the book, ""Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian"", by Richard Hough, and is based on a true story.  The movie portrays events that brought about the eventual take over or mutiny of the crew of the English vessel, The Bounty.  Fletcher Christian, the Master's Mate, and friend of Lt. William Bligh, Captain of the ship led the mutiny. The movie starts with the trial of Captain Bligh before the Admiralty Board.  It is then a flashback flash forward as Captain Bligh relates his account of why he lost a ship under his command.

The Bounty was to sail for Tahiti to pick up breadfruit plants and carry them to Jamaica.  Captain Bligh chose to sail around the horn of Africa supposedly to save time.  I got the impression he had a personal goal to accomplish what others thought impossible because of the unpredictable weather.  It was a bad decision.

The tension grows between the crew and the captain mostly provoked by Churchill.  Cruel punishment is meted out to the crew is pretty hard to stomach.  Reaching Tahiti only adds to the tension as many including Christian who fell in love with a native gail and wanted to stay there.  The much reduced crew finally set sail to carry it's cargo to Jamaica the ship is caught in a storm and is lost.  Bligh manages to save a few of the crew.

Great movie and character well played.  A true classic.",1464652800,2,1474,4.509433962264151

I like about any role that Anthony Hopkins plays. His character in this movie was uneven and not very inspiring. Why he promoted Mel Gibson never made any sense. Even more uneven was the role Mel Gibson played. His jump from second in command to a total love struck idiot for an island girl was weak.

673247,4,630347151X,"I enjoyed it because it was closest to the historical events.  Other films were based on the somewhat overly dramatized novel 'Mutiny on the Bounty', and embellished even more by hollywood screenwriters. These depicted Bligh as a depraved martinet, given to dealing out brutal punishment for the slightest offense. Christian is portrayed as a noble hero driven to extreme acts to protect his crew from Bligh's excesses.
In ""The Bounty"",  Anthony Hopkins played Lieutenant Bligh as he was, an experienced seaman and navigator, but a rigid, withdrawn man and poor leader that browbeat and drove his men because he was determined to succeed in his mission and move up in the Navy. Fletcher Christian was portrayed as a well-to-do Englishman that had ""gone native"", a term of contempt in Colonial England, indicating he chose to reject his heritage as a gentleman, and live among uncivilized indigenous peoples.  Christian turned on his friend Lieutenant Bligh as well, and was tormented by having placed a death sentence on Bligh and the loyal crewmen set adrift, and upon himself and the other mutineers, who would surely be hunted down and punished.",1463788800,,1148,5.095744680851064

673415,4,630347151X,The Bounty stars a good looking Mel Gibson. Before the ugliness that he kept inside seeped outward and turned him into the ugly troll he looks like today. Also look for a young Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson in small roles. The original version with Clark Gable is better but this one beats the Marlon Brando remake from the 60's.

674299,3,630347151X,"I seem to say ""meh"" a lot. But I think I was fooled by the 8.1 IMDB rating. On the one hand, seeing existing and future Oscar winners from Britain (and Australia) all in a film directed by an Aussie is certainly a treat. And, the marvelous Blade Runner-style score by Vangelis really is a reason to see this, what is apparently considered the most historically accurate account of the infamous and eponymous Mutiny. But I found myself wishing it were a lot shorter, and there were a lot fewer tits apoppin'. I mean really, from 1/3 of the way through, and on half the screen time is taken up by nubile ""Tahitians"" with their udders flopping. Considering that hard core sex was still blissfully absent from the big screen (at least in American financed productions) in 1984, this is what passed for soft core porn. Yes, Anthony Hopkins -- pre Hannibal -- is great, and so is Mel Gibson. But Daniel Day Lewis is just annoying as a fey Master of the Ship, and Laurence Olivier is, well, just sad. He was obviously on his last leg or near it when this was made. His entire performance is seated, which I think is no accident. Good, of course - photography is also top notch. Great?

674306,5,630347151X,"How could a film with Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins, Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson sink without trace? That was the fate of Roger Donaldson's 'The Bounty' back in 1984 when none of them were exactly box-office certainties. Indeed, the third dramatization of the British Navy's most infamous act of piracy (excluding the semi-documentary 'In the Wake of the Bounty') and is perhaps best remembered today as the flop that David Lean nearly directed before falling out with Dino De Laurentiis (UA studio boss Steven Bach infamously greenlit 'Heaven's Gate' instead of a Lean version!). It certainly deserves to be better remembered, boasting a superb screenplay by Robert Bolt (originally intended as two films: the second, dealing with the aftermath was quietly dropped after this tanked) that owes a lot more to history than previous versions despite its occasional inaccuracies.

A young Mel Gibson impresses as the weak-willed Fletcher Christian, drawn into rebelling more by place and circumstances as well as by a crew of thugs with dirty mugs than a clichd catalogue of tyranny, but it's Anthony Hopkins' film all the way. Before his irretrievable descent into ham he was a much more restrained screen actor, and his Captain Bligh is a much more interesting creation than you suspect he'd manage today. Fighting his own demons in a permissive place that rips away the moral repressions of his crew and creates a culture of defiance and inertia that he is unable to combat by either understanding or discipline (if anything, Bligh's fault here is that he is too slack on the men for too long before disastrously overcompensating on the return voyage), the film is punctuated by images of his desperately haunted face as he is faced with the realization of his escalating failure and impotence. Yet it is ultimately Bligh who triumphs and is vindicated in this version, with Christian and his mutineers left at each other's throats as they are cast out of paradise and stranded on a barren shore.

It's impressive, powerful stuff, even more so today for its reality. No cgi, few model shots, they built a real ship and took it to sea for real (even 'Master and Commander' was almost entirely shot in a studio tank in Mexico), and the hardships and efforts pay dividends on screen. Donaldson's direction is better than anything he's done since, Arthur Ibbetson's cinematography impressive and even Vangelis' much maligned score has some of the psychological savagery you can find in Alex North's work on 'Spartacus'. Only a hammy Edward Fox (sparingly used, thankfully) and a superannuated Laurence Olivier strike the odd bum note in the court of inquiry scenes that provide the film's solid framework. I for one would love to see the second Bolt script, 'The Long Arm,' finally make it to the screen some day - hard to believe, but it's a much better tale by far.

The Bounty has never had a smooth voyage on home video, with none of the previous releases entirely satisfying - the MGM/UA DVD was a respectable but unexciting transfer though the MGM logo (not on the original theatrical prints from Orion) and Leo's roar drowned out part of Vangelis' score while the only extra was a trailer; the first UK DVD had an impressive array of extras (not all in great quality) but was a rather odd transfer that needed you to 'stretch' the image to see it in widescreen due to what was presumably an encoding error while subsequent releases were extras-free. Thankfully Twilight Time's region-free limited edition Blu-ray finally does it some justice with the best transfer it's received today, reflecting both the dour colors of the voyage that contrast so vividly with the brighter light and palette of Tahiti, As well as a booklet, trailer and an isolated score track it also includes the two audio commentaries from that deleted first UK DVD release, one from Roger Donaldson, producer Bernie Williams and production designer John Graysmark and the other  by historical consultant Stephen Walters.",1436227200,5,3998,4.971599402092676

674480,5,630347151X,"This is  a really great film in many ways. Photographically it will make you want to quit your job and head to the South Pacific. The soundtrack written by Vangelis is probably some of the most well written music I have ever heard. Vangelis did not get the credit due him for writing this score. It was difficult to find the entire soundtrack in the past because of some contractual matter. Anthony Hopkins.. you know he's going to put 100% into film he makes. This is his finest film in my opinion. Mel looks great in this film and he's very fresh. His lines seem strained during the mutiny and I would have to say that scene is the weakest. Mel is trying to ditch his ""Mad Max"" image in this film and he succeeds nicely. The director captures human emotion in a way that will break your heart. I've watched this film about 10 times. I don't think it will ever be boring to me. Photo credit ""The Bounty Club""",1434067200,2,909,4.315789473684211
674481,5,630347151X,"I am a huge Roger Donaldson fan, although I believe his film Thirteen Days (2000) about JFK and the Cuban missile crisis took too many liberties with the truth. This was probably a more realistic tale and one closer to the actual facts of the naval mutiny aboard the H.M.S. Bounty than even the 1935 classic Academy award winner for Best Picture starring Oscar winners Charles Laughton and Clark Gable in the William Bligh and Fletcher Christian roles respectively. In this one, Hollywood's newest male sex symbol on the rise Mel Gibson is an idealistically charismatic foil to a much more complex and not-so-sadistic Captain Bligh portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. Although Laughton was already an Academy award winner for Best Actor (The Private Life of Henry VIII) when he and Gable sailed to Tahiti for exteriors in 1934, Gable was still largely unknown but would win the award for It Happened One Night before Mutiny On The Bounty was released. Hopkins (who won the Best Actor for the year 1991) and Gibson (the Best Director of 1995) were not yet household names, but not exactly nobodies either when they went to the islands in 1983. I believe this film The Bounty is the finest either ever appeared in although I can understand why The Silence of the Lambs won the prize in 1991 with Hopkins in the lead role, and why Gibson's Braveheart won the Best Picture of 1995, although the latter film took more license with history than even Oliver Stone's JFK (actually the Best Picture of 1991 imho). No less an authority than the legendary multiple Academy-Award winning director David Lean (Laurence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai) considered this version of the mutiny the finest screenplay he had ever read. He turned it down because of some arguments with Robert Bolt who won Academy awards for writing the scripts for Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965) and the following year for Fred Zinnemann's A Man For All Seasons, the 1966 Best Picture winner. This version of the infamous mutiny is equal in measure to the 1935 classic and in many ways vastly superior to the 1962 Trevor Howard/Marlon Brando movie, although I think Howard's Captain Bligh is a chillingly magnificent performance and that film's one saving grace. Marlon Brando (ironically like Mel Gibson also unfortunately a closet anti-Semite) was too over-the-top as Fletcher Christian and his British accent was an absolute hoot. He was also more famous at the time he portrayed Christian than either Gable or Gibson were when they tackled the part.
In this 1984 version Gibson easily slips into the role of Lt. Christian as did Gable (then also Hollywood's sex god on the rise). Anthony Hopkins is great as Captain Bligh, although both Laughton and Howard are actually better, if far less human. Howard's Bligh is a sadistically cruel madman. Laughton was, by the way, Hopkins' favorite actor growing up, and he later played Quasimodo in the 1989 televised remake of Laughton's other great role in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939). The Welsh-born Hopkins, who also acted on stage in both Britain and America after his 1968 film debut in The Lion In Winter (which also starred Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn in the fourth of her record four Oscar wins) has had a stunningly superb career in many films of the 1970s and 1980s. He was never fully appreciated until his unforgettable performance as serial monster Hannibal Lector. I thought he deserved the Best Actor prize for this film as well as The Silence of the Lambs, but he wasn't even noticed by the Academy in 1984 and they gave the award to F. Murray Abraham for his astonishingly good performance as Mozart's jealous rival in Amadeus, which was also richly deserved. Amadeus, like The Bounty, is about a true life rivalry, and like Amadeus,The Bounty is simply a perfect time capsule of the late eighteenth century with wonderful cinematography, costumes, and excellent performances all-round. It will also be the only chance you'll ever have to watch legendary Academy award winners Gibson, Hopkins, Lord Laurence Olivier, as well as the future three-time Best Actor winner (and male record holder) Daniel Day-Lewis in the same film. Lewis, who portrays the diffident officer who is replaced by Christian as the second-in-command aboard the ship, would become nearly as big an actor as Gibson would a movie star, but here he makes much of a smaller role that is very fine but which went largely unnoticed. Sir Laurence (arguably the greatest actor of all time) appears in The Bounty as a British admiral conducting the inquest of Capt. Bligh. Another naval officer at the inquest is portrayed by Edward Fox, who was so great in The Day of the Jackal (1973), also directed by the great Fred Zinnemann. And yes, Liam Neeson, the future Academy award nominee for Schindler's List and son-in-law of Vanessa Redgrave, plays a sailor named Churchill (no relation to the aristocratic dynasty of the same name) and Bernard Hill, who would later portray the ill-fated Captain Smith in James Cameron's Academy-award winning 1997 blockbuster Titanic, appears as Bligh's trusted boatswain who quite literally whips the crew into shape, especially the unfortunate Neeson, who has since become a huge box office success in blockbusters to rival Mel Gibson's body of work.
I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's fabulous on all counts, and the young (twenty-eight-year-old) Gibson, who would finally gain international stardom in the Lethal Weapon films, is just drop-dead gorgeous. His scenes with Tahitian princess Tia Carere are breathtaking to behold. So is she. The chemistry between them is beyond terrific. Thirty years on, we can doubly appreciate what once was, however bittersweet. Too bad he hasn't come to terms yet with middle-age and has become such an ungrateful bigot. This is still an exhilarating, though not exactly pleasant, journey down memory lane even if the tale itself (like Gibson's real life) doesn't have a happy ending. The revolt on the H.M.S. Bounty was the biggest story of its day and the most famous shipboard mutiny ever. Its a story that needed to be told on the big screen more than once and this version is hard to top.",1433894400,4,6186,4.9433237271853985

The production is lushly beautiful, contrasting the cold, formal halls of the court martial, the tightly packed fug of the ship, and the lush, wide-open beauty of Tahiti. The dramatic tension maintains stays high throughout, but I wish we could have seen more of Fletcher Christian's lead-up to his decision to lead the mutiny. When everybody knows the story already, the film's job is to show us the details with new insight.

In the beginning of the story, I made judgements of the characters  that I later came to realize were unjust.  As I continue to learn about life, morality and just behavior is usually not black and white and this movie, this tale, was yet another example of how this is true.  As the story unfolded, the complexity of the characters and their personal dilemmas began to color my aforementioned judgement and through its telling created for me an awareness of the humanity of the characters involved.  The films cast was, as expected, supreme even 30 years ago! They gave great credibility to the films authenticity and made it easy to connect with each character.  Of course, Anthony Hopkins, even so long ago, was beyond phenomenal as the ships unstable captain.  I was surprised that I  enjoyed this movie so much and would definitely recommend it.",1433289600,,992,4.863095238095238
674595,5,630347151X,"This is one of my favorite movies, for many reasons.

First is the historical accuracy...the filmmakers strove to achieve that. Captain Bligh is not the horrendous villain of Charles Laughton or Trevor Howard...Anthony Hopkins plays him as a more commanding figure, and downright heroic when he and his loyalists are cast adrift from the Bounty after the mutiny, navigating by memory from the South Seas to Koupang in Timor, purely by memory, with very little food, and virtually nowhere to stop to load up more.

Mel Gibson and Liam Neeson are excellent in their roles: Gibson first as the friend of Bligh who is dissipated by the easy life in the South Seas, and Neeson (and others) as the crewmen who foment mutiny and make Gibson an unwilling supporter of it. Gibson is truly ""in hell"" when he has to lead a mutiny against his old friend.

Edward Fox and Laurence Olivier chew the scenery effectively as the Royal Navy prosecutor and Lord Hood, in the film's bookending and transitional framework of Bligh's after-action court-martial. Fox is efficient, and Olivier is...well, Olivier.

Some critics have suggested there are overtones of a homosexual relationship between Bligh and Christian -- I'm not good at reading people, but I didn't see it. I did see Bligh being discomfited that he was devoting himself to duty and propriety while his pal and right-hand man was lying in a grass shack on the beach, covered in tattoos, bopping a local girl. If anything, it reminded me of how I am at parties -- stuck in the corner, not knowing what to do or what to say, unable to make small talk, while everyone else is having a good time.

The production values are also extremely high...a replica HMS Bounty crewed by appropriately salty-looking Britons sails the ocean to a South Seas island, meets up with local Polynesians, and gets into all sorts of adventures. Everything has a great period feel.

Vangelis also created a superb sound track to this picture, which summons up the tension between Bligh and Christian, the image and feel of a tall ship racing across the ocean, the fear and struggle of Bligh's castaways trying to make it home or Christian's shipmates, girlfriends (some pregnant), and family trying to find a new home amid the wastes of the South Pacific.

All I can say is that this is just one of my favorite movies.",1433289600,2,2337,4.784119106699752

675184,3,630347151X,"Of Course I've heard the title many times, but had neither read the book nor seen the film until this moment.  What I fail to see is the Great Issue,
the Terrible Conflict which supported either a wonderful story. engaging clash of personalities,or interesting mystery.

I usually have admiration for Anthony Hopkins' acting; this time it escaped me.  As Lt. Bligh, he seemed rigid, inflexible, rather distracted and inattentive.  His attention seemed to wander, making several serious mistakes, such as rounding the Cape (Africa) during weather he should have
been able to predict, and later, after the prolonged and luxurious stay in Tahiti, became ridiculously irrational declaring the deck to be unclean and
demanding it be swabbed thrice all without a glimmer of a hint of his real state of mind to tell the viewer he was just tightening things up and really had a respect or love for his men and everyone's best interest.  I never felt any humanness in him, especially seeing him sit with all his linen and woolen clothes on, sweating, in a delightful tropical climate.  His whole character for me was distant, not quite there, and untouchable in any human
way.

Fletcher Christian - Mel Gibson seemed quite young, perhaps only 19 or slightly older, that is, still a teen ager mentally and physically.  We guess they had a formerly long term, highly respectful almost familial relationship of mutual admiration and understanding.  When Christian says nothing but observes and observes, I thought he was taking things in and weighing them against his known values. Because of his high ideals, and youth,
and from what love and respect he had for Bligh, the situation and its' fortune wasn't adding up for him.

I detest the dominator attitude of Bligh and the English Crown of that time, and the result that ""discipline"" included physical torture and beating.  I
think a ""tight ship"" can be run without that extreme, and with consequences that give a man time to grow into a new attitude, such as tidying up,and cleaning, and polishing, or a round of less desirable chores.  Sometimes, I say  sometimes, a person who gets very reactive ,may profit by
a yell or slap JUST to get their attention, although I'm starting to feel uncomfortable about even that, but I fail to see how damaging someone when
there is no real medical care and the food is already really bad is really uplifting or convincing.  So, perhaps Flectcher thought his old friend getting
irrational, and certainly missed a wonderful chance to learn some very interesting values from the natives, which were a lot more life serving than
Engllsh military society's at that time.  Et voila!  a mutiny.  Pretty weak, but what else might be possible?

However, it is interesting to note that Christian experienced the same quality of revolt from the crew as did Bligh, and was successful with less help.  They had the food, didn't they, so no one was starving?  Why didn't the crew come to him in a more conciliatory and grateful mood?  That was hard to understand.  And by striking  comparison, Bligh managed to get a small overfilled boat to a safe harbor by his discipline and training.

So, the story has too many inconsistencies.  It looks like they both survived.  I am curious that there was only one man left of the island group, with 9 women, possibly the same in the original flight.  There were possibly a dozen men who landed, and even if Liam Neeson and his buddies
decided to go elsewhere, more men should be left.

So,it's an unfortunate conclusion:  the story doesn't add up.  I don't understand the big deal, and would like to know what happened on that island.",1430006400,,3644,4.821256038647343

675384,4,630347151X,"""The Bounty""(1984)  is the fifth(and most recent) film version of one of the most famous and infamous mutinies on the high seas that has been studied and debated by historians for over two hundred years. Director Roger Donaldson's film is a revisionist telling of that mutiny told from the perspective of Lt. William Bligh(not Captain). The screenplay by Robert Bolt attempts to exonerate the reputation of Bligh by framing the story starting and ending the film with the British Naval Court-martial of Bligh and telling the main story through flashback. In that respect, Bligh comes off as more human in the film compared to the villainess portrayal by Charles Laughton in the 1935 ""Mutiny on the Bounty"". Released by Orion Pictures in 1984, MGM(which owns the Orion catalog) has provided an excellent print to Twilight Time for it's Blu-ray debut and fans of both the film and story of the mutiny will be pleased(Bitrate:29.94). The film opens and closes in darkness with only the music of Vangelis to be heard. However, once the first images appear on screen viewers will be in for a satisfying visual experience. The cinematography by Arthur Ibbetson is stunning especially when the Bounty finally arrives in Tahiti(although the primary filming location was Moorea and New Zealand). Colors are very vivid now on Blu-ray with many scenes popping off the screen. The only troublesome scenes are those filmed at night where heavy grain is visible but overall this is a very pleasing Blu-ray presentation. Viewers can easily see how the young crew of the Bounty became intoxicated when they finally arrived on Tahiti and saw all beautiful bare-breasted Tahitian girls and laidback life-style of what they probably thought was a paradise compared to their life in puritan England. It's no wonder Bligh had problems with his crew after four months on Tahiti. Anthony Hopkins gives an exceptional performance as Bligh which is more defined, revealing and sympathetic than Laughton's version of the man. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Fletcher Christian is subdued and more on the melancholy side. Future stars Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson are excellent in their supporting roles. The Audio(English 5.1 DTS-HD MA) has been given an upgrade too with dialogue and other sounds being crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pop, etc.) ""The Bounty"" is 131 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH.

675526,5,630347151X,"The Bounty (1984)
 The timeless tale of the Bounty mutiny comes to the screen in this spectacular Dino
De Laurentis production.  Released in 1984 the film maintains solid entertainment value even in the 21st century.
 The main protagonists, Capt. Bligh and Mister Christian are wonderfully played by Anthony Hopkins and the then young Mel Gibson.  Also featured is Sir Laurence Olivier in a supporting role. Watch for Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in small roles as young actors. When actors of this caliber get together in a wide screen historical drama we have the possibility of a great event in film making.  Director Roger Donaldson takes full advantage of the beautiful possibilities of wide ocean views, graceful sailing ships and the scenic views of Tahiti and Tahitian girls.  The drama of the mutiny itself gives us gripping story to watch.
 The Bounty holds up well.  Fans of great historical films and fans of good acting and directing will want to see this one or to watch it again if they haven't seen it for a few decades.
 It lasts a good long while too at two hours and 10 minutes.  I give it a strong four saw blades.",1429488000,,1138,4.702020202020202

A really well done performance by Anthony Hopkins who portrays Bligh as more inflexible, ambitious and petulant than sadistic.  Marred chiefly by a sub par performance from Mel Gibson who manages to make Christian's motivations in leading the mutiny seem murky and unconvincing. Needless to say, it is a more complicated part when not played across from a tyrannical and deranged captain.  It comes across as a mutiny born in self indulgence and sexual frustration and not even from love  Better chemistry with the Tahitian princess who putatively was the precipitating cause of the mutiny might have helped.  Mel simply does noble better than ignoble.  I think the part was just out of his range.  Daniel Day-Lewis appears in a smaller part as the sailing master of the Bounty.  Somehow I think he could have done Christian in a more complex and convincing manner.",1428883200,,921,4.973856209150327

It may be a culturally and historically accurate portrayal, but many parents see a PG rating and think that means family movie, so just be aware in advance of what you will be seeing.",1422316800,,582,4.772277227722772

676392,5,630347151X,"This is the 3rd 'Mutiny on the Bounty' major film based on the actual mutinies that occurred on the high seas during the age of sail.  The prior film with Charles Laughton showed the captain surviving the mutiny and the travails of being cast adrift, but virtually ignored their(the captain and those still loyal to the Crown) voyage and rescue.  Well, 'The Bounty' finally shows us what the captain and his remaining crew experienced in their open launch.  It was a fascinating mini-tour of the Pacific islands and atolls.
The plot, as with the previous films and the basic historical facts, had Captain (really Lieutenant) William Bligh(Anthony Hopkins) as a taskmaster berating his mostly conscripted or impressed crew.  They had to bring breadfruit for feeding slaves in service to the Crown.  The mission is sidelined when they get to the tropical islands and the crew become disenchanted with Bligh, the rigors of Royal Naval duty; then there was the allure of the native maidens.  The mutiny under Mr. Christian(Mel Gibson) slowly developes until Bligh is cast adrift with those still loyal, or afraid to mutiny.  Bligh uses every scrap of his knowledge of the seas, the Pacific islands, and the endurance of men to keep the crew together.  He barely succeeds but does and they make it back to England.  There, an admiralty court absolves him of any blame for the mutiny and loss of his ship.
Meanwhile, Gibson had the dregs of the crew and they find Pitcairn Island, not on the charts of the time.  They burn the ship lest the Royal Navy spot it, and them.  We're left to wonder what happened but the last credits of the film inform us that a whaling ship found some survivors there.  It turns out they had a falling out and only a handful of the conspirators made it.  No one(ostensibly) made it back to England.
This is a wonderful period piece with a haunting musical score.  A must have for historical buffs and fans of adventure or the great stars Gibson and Hopkins.",1418256000,,1980,4.718023255813954

676426,5,630347151X,"Director Roger Donaldson's THE BOUNTY (UK/USA-1984) is my favorite version of an oft-told story.
With Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins, Daniel Day-Lewis, Edward Fox, Bernard Hill, Liam Neeson and Laurence Olivier.

This one has the ring of truth to it, especially during the post-mutiny story, where Lt. Bligh and a crew of 18 loyal men successfully navigate a ship's launch across a vast ocean to the island of Timor, some 3,600 nautical miles from where they were cast adrift. This remarkable feat may have weighed heavily in Bligh's favor during a naval inquest into the events surrounding the April 1789 mutiny, for he was cleared of culpability and subsequently continued his career in the Royal service.

The Tahiti portion of this picture is quite spectacular, especially for those who enjoy the sight of dozens of young lovelies naked from the waist up. It's also interesting to see the local customs, including a feast that has for entertainment a most sexual ritual dance.

Each main actor has his spotlights, often several. One of Gibson's most convincing is the emotional turmoil his Spencer Christian  endures as he prepares to commit Bligh and several crewmembers to certain death in a small open boat. Hopkins' Capt. Bligh shines in his determination to pull his men through the terrible ordeal they now faced.

Rather than seeing the story as a fight for individual rights over tyranny (1935, with Gable the resistor) or youth versus age (Marlon Brando in 1963?), this film tries to be even-handed and views Bligh's incredible achievement  of bringing back 12 men in an open boat across the pacific as more impressive than Christian's attempt to create a hedonist's Eden on Pitcairn Island, a choice that apparently didn't take among his fellow mutineers.  This film feels truer to the actual history than the earlier version, and is particularly well-shot and acted.  Dig Laurence Oliver's gigantic hat if you like.  Not a ripping yarn however.

Number two was the Mel Gibson version primarily for the unrestrained rages of Anthony Hopkins.  The least entertaining was the Clark Gable, Chas Laughton version, which seems to be the critic's favorite.  Perhaps individual critics touted the Laughton version as a classic because all the other critics did.  As much as I like Laughton movies, he seemed dull in the role of Bligh.  And Clark Gable, whom I don't remember from other pictures, contributed a semi-impressive jaw and haircut.

None of the movies follow the Nordoff and Hall book, but plot details are not important.  The movies are all about the interaction between Christian and Bligh.",1396656000,,860,4.916666666666667

The Captain, as with all captains, believes his way is not only the right way but the only way.  Take a crew of hardened sailors and place them in Tahiti for longer than anticipated and the improbable and unimaginable become real.

Captain (LT) William Bligh, exonerated by The Admiralty's Court for his actions, was a hard man.  Master's Mate, and former personal friend of LT Bligh, Fletcher Christian was more of a crew's officer.  While neither is a better trait, and both are bad traits, after leaving Tahiti, his new and pregnant wife, Christian deliberates mutiny - a crime for which he knows to be sure, is a hanging offense.

Christian sets Bligh and sailors loyal to him adrift returning to Tahiti asking the Tahitian King for safe harbor.  The king refuses knowing the British Navy would hold him culpable.  The king allows Christian to take his daughter (Christian's pregnant wife), woman loyal to the sailors and several warriors.

If you follow my reviews and recommendations you than know I am accurate 99% of the time!
Men, women, boys and girls: This is a MUST SEE AND OWN!! A MUST HAVE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION!
This movie cast two of not only thee hottest men but two of thee finest actors! Its therefore a no brainer, nuff said, rent or own this flick!
Anthony Hopkins is at his best playing the role of captain of a large transport sail boat. He undertakes his than great friend, second in command, Mel Gibson to embark on a long distance shipping expedition.
Perhaps half way to their destiny, they spot land in the distance and decide to take a much needed reprieve off the ship. They are greeted by a very large native tribe who ""rush"" them as though never before having saw other people.
Hopkins is a happily married christian man and these natives have women who are sex starved and open for business for the feast of white handsome American men!
What happens next is so lifelike so do able that it makes you really understand the feelings and the behavior of these young men who perhaps never had a woman be so attentive such a sex slave as these naked horny woman are.
Mel finds hes fallen in love with the tribes Chief's daughter. He has impregnated her and the Captain has realized if he doesnt get his men into shape, stop the orgies and all night day drinking and partying he will lose the mens respect and seamen hands.
Half way back into their journey Mel keeps seeing the woman he has fallen in love with and is carrying his baby. The captain makes what happens easy to do as he seems to have ""lost it"" and treats the men horribly to earn or command their respect.
They finally agree they want the easy good life where woman were sex slaves and they did nothing but sex and drink day and night.
Hence: MUTINY!
What happens after Mel and his fellow traitors take over the ship?? That is for Kim who KNOWS and for my readers to FIND OUT!
Your going to be absolutley impressed by the awesome scenery the great acting and you will be in love with the ending.
IM SERIOUS FOLKS IM GIVING THIS MOVIE FIVE STARS AND A BIG THUMBS UP!

The verdict came as a surprise.",1392249600,,141,4.68
676712,4,630347151X,"I finally got round to watching this film and I really enjoyed it. I brought two mirrors to bear in my mind as I watched. One was the film ""Master and Commander"", which is not a mutiny story but depicts the era and life on the oceans. The other is a masterpiece of investigative historical research. The book is ""The Bounty: the true story of the mutiny on the Bounty"" by Caroline Alexander. Examining this story from a wealth of rarely seen documents in Australia and New Zealand (if I recall) she was able to piece together many disjointed parts of the mutiny. Further she provided much background information about what became of Bligh and those involved in the mutiny. I cannot recommend her book enough for those who have a taste for this crazy story.

First of all the film is gorgeous to look at. The scenery fairly drips with colours. The bare chested natives are also nice eye-candy. The uniforms of commissioned officers just about pop out of the screen with such bright shades. I quite enjoyed the manner in which the trial that Bligh, like all commanders or captains who had lost their ship had to endure, was juxtaposed back and forth into the story. (Now that I think about it, this would be a good time to plug all of the Aubrey/Maturin novels of the beloved Patrick O'Brian. From him you will learn as much if not more about naval life than by reading Alexander's terrific book).

A few weaknesses in retrospect come to mind. Sir Joseph Banks was the man who put the entire breadfruit, Tahiti expedition in motion. That it was an adventure to find a way of growing food cheaply and efficiently to feed slaves on Jamaica makes the blood run hot. That they continued back to Tahiti once again to pursue the fruit was surely one of the lowest points in English history. I am surprised that Banks was not inserted more clearly as the initiator of this madness. I would normally say that Mel Gibson gives a strong performance in whatever role he inhabits, given that he is a very talented actor. Notwithstanding a loathing of him as a person outside of the movie industry, I didn't let my revulsion influence watching him act. I found his embodiment of Fletcher Christian a bit wobbly. I say this because instead of emoting something more clearly defined as turmoil when it was appropriate, too often, for my liking, he wore a blank look on his face. Compare this to the master actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins, who is famous for allowing the character he represents to be transparent and fully involved.

Over all I think that it is under rated and if trashed by critics of that time, unjustly so. I saw a comment here from someone who said ""forget Master and Commander"". Not so. It also is a superb film and adheres very closely to the several O'Brian novels from which the script is crafted. Finally, I am not really a big fan of Vangelis. I mean, the only film that I associate his soundtrack music to is the always entertaining ""Blade Runner"". I can't imagine that film without the music. Seen these many years later, the 1984 film of the Bounty does not couple well with the electronic sounds that Vangelis was known for. A minor quibble but I'm a musician and am fussy about soundtracks. By comparison there is not one single sound of music that is out of place in ""Master and Commander"". The Bounty is good movie making.",1392163200,,3333,4.56093489148581

676804,3,630347151X,"Mel Gibson is the worst of the three Fletcher Christian's. He doesn't have much to do - poor guy. The underlying theme of this film, which is not based on the famous Nordhoff and Hall novel, but rather on a recent 're-examination',  is that Bligh was right and the mutineers were the real villains.  This is a kind of British slant. The Brits are more likely to support authority than are Americans.

Almost all the drama - such as there is - is in Anthony Hopkins brain. Gibson's Christian is a rather dull witted but pleasant young fellow who crumbles under pressure. In his big mutiny scene he's depicted as peevish. Bligh's only vice in this recounting is his tendency to yell at the men. Other's like Laughton and Howard have shown in Bligh a sadistic streak, but Hopkins' only fault is that he's occasionally rude.

Be aware that a significant portion of it features the women of Tahiti wearing nothing but loincloths; this sets the stage for the funniest scene in the movie, which involves Anthony Hopkins, but I won't spoil it by giving it away.  Parents may want to use caution, as the native girls perform a welcome dance for the British sailors, and it becomes very suggestive.  There is also a death scene that, while not the bloodiest I've seen on film, was certainly brutal.  No matter what you may think after viewing it, in real life Bligh was the hero of this story.  Vangelis' exquisite score really added to the sense of mystery, danger, loss, and beauty.  Speaking of beauty, the location scouts did an excellent job.  I'd really like to see this film undergo a full restoration, so that the scenery could be viewed in all its glory.  If you want the real story, I believe the History Channel had a program on it some years ago; whether it's available on dvd, I don't know.

A waste of my time and money.",1370995200,,476,4.021052631578947
676932,5,630347151X,"I say this Movie is an Epic, because I think the producers and writers of this flick, were very true and accurate to the actual official records and details, as well as what actually happened on this fateful voyage and the mutiny on the Bounty.
I especially liked the very end scenes, where they burn the Bounty, under the cliffs of Pitcairn at night, realizing this was the only way to keep hidden from British Navy ships, hunting for those mutineers. At least this scene, the ship burning at anchor, under the cliffs, no matter where it actually was filmed, looked like it was filmed on Pitcairn!

I fault the 1964 movie version of ""Mutiny On the Bounty!"" starring Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard for using other views of Tahiti or Moorea Island, or wherever, as set scene for Pitcairn Island. Pitcairn is a tiny rock island with little flat arable land, barely over 2 miles long and one mile wide! The shots of Tahiti or Bora Bora, or wherever, made to depict Pitcarin, at the end of this movie, ruined it for me, because it is horribly inaccurate and historically incorrect. I knew better!
As well, I think Brando and Howard screwed-up the parts they were acting, simply because Howard as Bligh, wasn't mad and maniacal enough as Bligh truly was, and Brando as Christian was just too laid back, until the very end.
However, this older movie had going for it, the fact that: they used the only full scale hand built replica of the HMS Bounty, ever made, as the movie set! That 1964 film was shot mostly on the HMS Bounty, built by MGM just for that movie set, at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, Canada. This ship was hand built by master craftsmen, Lunenburg shipbuilders had long been world-famous for!

Going back to the movie The Bounty starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins: Hopkins as Bligh, at sea under pressure, quickly went absolutely bonkers on his crew, very abusive or the tinest infractions of the men and really showed us the true mad-man Bligh could be at the drop of a hat. Hopkins nailed the part of Bligh, to-the-letter!
Gibson as Christian, acted his part superbly and his Aussie accent didn't hurt matters any, for belivability either! This team of main actors, had their parts down tight! They spoke the lines and played the parts, right along truest with history, as close to how it actually happened in this case, as I think can be done.

That decision on the Mutineers part, once on Pitcairn Island; to burn the evidence and all trace of the ship, held them in good stead, kept them all well hidden from the outside world, for the next 18 years, well after Bligh was too old and no longer a threat, long time after the British Navy ceased their relentless sea search for these fugitives.
I felt the writers and cast of The Bounty flick, had the crews feelings and reasonings, plus Christians reasons for actual mutiny, down tight with the actual facts. I also appreciate actual words Christian was quoted, (by Bligh and the others set adrift with him in the launch, at the mutineers court martial in England), in this pic, they used the very words Christian yelled at Bligh, during the Mutiny. They also had the lines and actions true to actual life as it happened on the Bounty, after the mutiny. Christian as mutineer Captain, always on guard, day and night, to keep this rebellious batch of mutineers from slitting his throat. IF Christain had not stumbled-upon Pitcairn Island by accident, hundreds of miles from where it was charted on the maps, that last morning at sea, I think the mutineers would've killed him, soon.
Unfortunately Christian and most of his men, the mutineers of The Bounty; died on Pitcairn Island, in the earliest years of their purposeful marooning there. Only John Adams lived to write and tell the actual story of the mutiny and life aboard the Bounty under Christian, and finding Pitcairn by accident, and those first long 18 years of life in exile, on Pitcairn.
I think everyone ought to, not only order this excellent DVD movie, The Bounty, but also the trilogy of books by Nordhoff & Hall: ""Mutiny On The Bounty,"" ""Men Against The Sea"" and ""Pitcairns Island.""
I also highly recommend the US English translation of the actual HMS Bounty Log Books written by Bligh, Christian and Adams, as well as the Log books kept on Pitcairn, those first long 18 years marooned there. If the latter is not in book form, there certainly are official web-sites that have those documents you can read! Its well worth your time!

677009,5,630347151X,"This is the fifth and by far the best relation of the tale of the Mutiny on the Bounty.

The characters of William Bligh and Fletcher Christian are portrayed much more accurately than in the 1935 and 1962 versions. Hopkins and Gibson are stunning. The audience can clearly see the tension mounting as the men are recalled from their taste of paradise in Tahiti by an increasingly pedantic and disciplinarian Bligh for the return voyage to England, where many of the peasant sailors lived under virtual slum conditions. Christian is on the receiving end of all of Bligh's complaints about the state of the ship, but is clearly shewn to be of two minds while relieving Bligh of his command and setting him adrift.

Adherence to historical fact throughout the film is better than in earlier versions, which, in particular, tended to portray Bligh as an utterly sadistic bastard (in accordance with their being based on an inaccurate story book about the mutiny). It is apparent from historical records that while Bligh's manner was offensive at times, he was actually lighter on punishment than many of his contemporaries, and was concerned for the wellbeing of his crew.

The soundtrack by the Greek composer Vangelis is excellent.

This is one of my favourite films, and the mutiny on the Bounty is an important event in British and world military history. It demonstrates what can happen when people who have been largely deprived of The Good Life in their home country have their little taste of paradise snatched from them by an authoritarian representative of the King.",1341964800,,1572,4.920754716981132
677010,3,630347151X,"The Bounty is a well told tale with a strong cast - including four future Oscar winners no less - Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Gibson (Producing and Directing ""Braveheart""), Liam Neeson (Schindler's List), and two-timer Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood).  Don't forget to include veteran actor, and already an Oscar winner, Sir Laurence (Hamlet) into the mix.  I compare this version easily with Brando's version, as that one had great actors like Trevor Howard and Richard Harris.  Both Gibson and Brando showed a side of Fletcher that was confused between romance and duty.  These are certainly two factors that led to his decision to mutiny. Gibson was a great actor in his younger days, and this movie showed that the New York born Aussie could hold his own after making ""alternative"" cult classics like Mad Max.  Hopkins portrayal of Bligh exceeds that of Richard Harris.  Hopkins shows a side of empathy, while remaining by the book, and seemingly ruthless - hard to do.

Now, that being said - lets not forget the original screen version of 1935.  This starred Clark Gable (Oscar Winner-1934) and Charles Laughton (Oscar Winner - 1933) as Fletcher and Bligh respectively.  The cast also includes Franchot Tone' in the cast.  It remains the only film to have garnered three Best Actor Nominations - for the same film - in the same year.  And yes, I still think the 1935 version is best.

677011,3,630347151X,"There are some very good aspects to this movie, but it does seem to slow down in parts. The very best thing about it is the music by Vangelis.

Anthony Hopkins plays Bligh, Mel Gibson plays Fletcher Christian and Sir Laurence Olivier plays Admiral Hood. The movie starts and ends at Bligh's hearing/court marshal/trial to decide whether he was to blame for losing his ship. Admiral Hood presides over the proceedings.

You know the story well enough, and this movie seems to stick pretty close to what is known, including a paragraph at the closing about what is not known: what became of Fletcher Christian.

Bligh, as you probably know, was not only exonerated but commended for his courage and seamanship in bringing the tiny boat in which he and his loyalists were set adrift when Christian and the rest of the crew seized the Bounty and returned to Tahiti. The story of how they got from Tahiti to Pitcairn Island is included as well.

Bligh and his remarkable voyage in what was really no more than a dingy with a sail is also depicted, including how they landed on an island which was so hostile they barely escaped with their lives. It was implied but not explicitly stated that the natives were cannibals.

It's a good adventure and lovely photography. But the scenes aboard ship are pretty chaotic, and perhaps we see here a beginning to Mel Gibson's fascination with blood. He does seem to have some sort of fetish.",1336694400,,1426,4.665338645418327

The gradual progression from merry seafaring to all-out mutiny is done with such skill that none will find it unbelievable.

The acting is perfect, especially by Hopkins, who outshines all other attempts at conveying this complex character. And, finally, Vangelis' score, while anachronistically electronic, sets the tone of a driving madness from the opening.

This is one of the best films ever made.",1329782400,,1032,6.103448275862069
677043,4,630347151X,"The Bounty (1984)
Directed: Roger Donaldson
Cast: William Bligh: Anthony Hopkins. Fletcher Christian: Mel Gibson. Mr. Fryer: Daniel Day-Lewis. Lawrence Olivier. Edward Fox. Liam Neeson. Bernard Hill.

The third major remake of the Mutiny on the Bounty incident is not based on the novels by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, but on history, drawing materials from Roger Hugh's book, ""Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian,"" 1972, which differed from the two fictional epics of 1935 and 1962 versions. Thus, the 1984 ""The Bounty"" presented the two principal characters in an entirely different light. To begin with, Bligh and Christian knew each other before they sailed together, and Bligh actually promoted Christian to his first mate over Fryer, who had held this position, soon after the bounty sailed. Bligh, as played by Hopkins, appears insecure, mild-mannered, the image of a true English ""gentleman,"" a captain who cares for his crew, and one who relies on Christian to keep disgruntled and brawling crew members in line. The film begins with his appearance before the Admiralty, where he is giving the account of the mutiny, a trial in which he had to defend himself. The rest of the story is told in flashbacks, as occasionally the action is broken to return to the questioning board. A voice-over commentary is used, but only sparingly, to help the flow of the narrative.

During the first part of the trip, the purpose of which is the same as in the fictional accounts, to procure roots of the breadfruit in Tahiti to transport to Jamaica as food of the slave population, Bligh behaves perfectly with both crew and his fellow officers, and none of the cruel floggings and other atrocities seen in the previous movies occur. The ship fails to negotiate Cape Horn, and has to change route and go around African Cape of Good Hope, thence to Australia and eventually to reach Tahiti, after a considerable delay.

The trouble begins in Tahiti. As Bligh tells the court, his crew, deprived of their domestic comforts for so long, succumb easily to the seductive environment of the tropical island, the climate, easy life, little labor, and the scores of bare-breasted women that welcome them. Bligh attributes Christian's change to his loss of moral fiber, and thus his authority and dignity of an officer of the Royal Navy. Inevitably, discipline is slackened, and when the return trip begins, the men are appalled by Bligh's persistence to go again around Cape Horn in his return route, gaining fame as one who has circumnavigated the globe. Friction develops, and a wild brawl breaks out, a brawl not initiated by Christian, who almost reluctantly takes the leading role, mostly to avoid slaughter on board the ship. Captain Bligh, with his loyal crew are lowered into the long boat, with barely enough provisions to reach a neighboring island. The movie never shows the Pandora (in actuality helmed by Captain Edwards, not Bligh) returning to Tahiti. It only shows Bligh's unbelievably arduous sea adventure, reaching Timor in the Dutch East Indies, while Christian, a few women, including his loyal girlfriend, sail for an unknown destination, under the threat of a new mutiny, until they discover Pitcairn Island, mapped wrongly, where the take refuge. The final scenes show the Bounty Burning, while the few exiles stay there forever. The trial ends with Bligh's dismissal of any guilt and heavy praise for his gallant return,

The Bounty offers good acting all around, excellent photography of exotic lands, and good action scenes, including a spectacular storm sequence. What it lacks, in comparison to its two predecessors, is dramatic tension between the two main characters--Bligh and Christian. Hopkins is too benign a character to evoke hatred, lacking Trevor Howard's sang-froid and Laughton's malice. He is too likable, too gentlemanly. Gibson looks more like a frightened--and tame--youth, too prone to be obsequious, too lovelorn to be brave. He lacks Gable's bravura masculinity, and Brando's mastery of withheld rage. Moreover, in the most dramatic scene in the story--the mutiny itself--what is shown is a chaotic melee which lacks the aura of inevitability of a clash between a villain and hero, in the other moves trumpeted from the moment these character set foot on the Bounty. Thus, the audience is held at a distance, uninvolved emotionally, despite some heartbreaking scenes--one of which is Christian's girl, slashing her head in sorrow when her lover departs. Still, this is a captivating movie, much worth viewing after nearly the three decades it was made.",1324080000,,4594,5.121333333333333

Thre's good action, good drama, good scenery to go along with good acting and casting.  Mel Gibson was still a relative newcomer on the movie scene when this film was made.  He had achieved some recognition from the ""Mad Max"" films but in this role he played a real life character, Fletcher Christian.  Anthony Hopkins brought the experience to the cast that brought out the solid performances from those who made up the ""Bounty's"" crew.

Straight-laced William Bligh commanded the ""Bounty"" on what was to be a circumnavigation of the globe to obtain breadfruit trees for Jamaica.  Storms at Cape Horn forced the ship to divert to the south Pacific via the Indian Ocean.  He alienated many of the crew with his discipline and insistence on order.  Eventually the ship lands at Tahiti amid ceremony and native pageantry.  The crew quickly begins to fraternize with native women which leads to further breakdowns in discipline.

Fletcher Christian, as Bligh's right hand man, emerges as the leader of those who seek to take control of the ship.  This is perhaps the film's defining scene as Christian refuses to harm Bligh, but stands his ground when challenged by Bligh.  Once in control of a mutinous crew, Christian has his hands full in finding safe haven away from the shipping lanes.  He retains order, but many are presumably ready to mutiny again if land isn't discovered soon.  As fate would have it, Bligh and those cast off in the life boat with him, find land and return to England.  Bligh is put on trial where he is exonerated of any wrongdoing.

This movie gives a good account of the mutiny on the Bounty.  With nothing but Bligh's log book as record it is difficult to recreate the events without some bias, but this film seems balanced in its approach.  The mutineers eventually discover Pitcairn Island where their descendents live to this day.  The film is well made with solid directing and acting.  After 25 years, it remains the standard on this historical event.",1273017600,4,2076,4.745810055865922

The Vangelis soundtrack will take you aback for a while. Wasn't sure I liked it at first as it is all synthetic sounds / instrumentation. Initially, for a period piece, it seemed out of place. Over time, I can appreciate it but think that in the end, a really great score with organic orchestral / tribal soundtrack would be better. The Vangelis reminds me a bit to much of Escape From New York. One thing though, the soundtrack is very sparse as is.

For starters, Gibson really doesn't get a chance to shine in this movie, Anthony Hopkins more or less has the larger role and handles it well, but even he seems subdued at times. There was considerable more interaction between Gable and Laughton in the original. The person I had the most sympathy for was Greek composer Vangelis. I've been a fan of this guy's music even before ""Chariots of Fire"", but here, he too seems restrained. Much of the score fits nicely with the visuals, nearly etheral and dream-like at times, but occasionally you get the feeling he really wanted to cut loose with something a little more sweeping and dramatic, ala ""Blade Runner"", but it would have been out of context with the core of the movie.
  Even after all these years, Tevaite Vernette is still a sight to behold. It's a shame this Tahitian-born beauty was a one-hit wonder, only doing this single film before returing to a normal life. I can certainly understand any man's fascination with her, as well as other topless island lovelies, but it would have been nice if the director had shown us more of the incrdeible beauty of Tahiti.

Accordingly, THE BOUNTY is a magnificent film, not only because of the acting, but also due to magnificent visuals depicting tropical beauty to harsh brutality on the open sea.

Hopkins is a sensational actor; his portrayal of Captain Bligh--a gruff, by-the-book officer bent on accomplishing his mission and voyage--is compelling and memorable.  He doesn't come across as a cold-blooded, raving, maniacal sadist, but as a hard man who exercises bad judgment, yet shows he, too, has feet of clay.  In fact, Hopkins's Bligh demonstrates considerable humanity for his men who are adrift with him on the Bounty's launch boat following the mutiny--a launch that will miraculously navigate thousands of miles on the open ocean.

And Gibson puts his own spin on young Fletcher Christian, the most famous mutineer in all of literature.  Gibson brings the torment the ship's mate is experiencing to the forefront, but often does it in Gibsonesque, over-the-top style.  Neeson, Day-Lewis, and Olivier are all solid in their supporting roles.  At two-plus hours, THE BOUNTY only drags (some) when the ship arrives in Tahiti, and the film goes into an inexplicable precipitous lull.  But the eye candy at that point more than compensates for this temporary plot breach.

Moreover like every would-be middle class sort Bligh was a sexual prig of sorts and deeply resented ""Mr Christian's"" (Mel Gibson) liason with the comely Tahitian chief's daughter -- indeed a hint of suppressed homosexual attraction and jealousy is present. Bligh though is a great sailor and a genuinely brave man; Christian in this film is the self-indulgent one, the upper class ""gentleman"" who yields to temptation and even a sexual obsession which turns out, it appears, to be rather less rewarding than the ""south sea paradise"" it may have suggested.

The principals are, as usual, very fine in their roles -- Hopkins is a bit ""mannered"" as his performances often are but Gibson is straight on, ""clean"" and Daniel Day Lewis shows up in a supporting role in which he manifests his ""darkly"" mysterious persona.

677185,5,630347151X,"The 1935 black & White version of ""Mutiny on the bounty"" may have won an oscar for Best Picture at the time, but will likely strike modern viewers as dated and unrealistic. Marlon Brando's 1962 remake is the most epic, captivating and compelling version even though it failed at the box office when first released; indeed the '62 version is a masterpiece (see my Amazon review). But Mel Gibson's 1984 version, simply called
""The Bounty,"" is without doubt the most historically accurate and realistic film version of the infamous mutiny.

THE PLOT: The Bounty mutiny story is so fascinating because it's TRUE. William Bligh, as acting captain, was sent on a mission in December 1787 to bring breadfruit plants from Tahiti back to England. Bligh intended on circumnavigating the globe in fulfilling the mission. Unfortunately he and his crew failed to get around Cape Horn, South America, and had to go the long way around Africa. It thus took them 10 months to reach Tahiti, wherein they were forced to stay another 5 months due to the breadfruit's ""dormant"" period. The natives were friendly and the women beautiful. It comes as no surprise that the crew naturally fell under the spell of the Polynesian paradise; Fletcher Christian even married the King's daughter, Maimiti. But after 5 months they had to get on with their mission and return to Naval discipline and England. Three and a half weeks later on April 28, 1789, Fletcher took over the ship with 18 other mutineers. 22 remained loyal to Bligh and 2 others were neutral. Christian set bligh and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship's launch boat and then sailed back to Tahiti where he dropped off 16 men but picked up 6 Tahitian men and 11 native women, including Maimiti. Fletcher then set forth with 8 other mutineers and the Tahitians to elude the Royal Navy, ultimately settling on Pitcairn Island, which was well off the beaten path and misplaced on Royal charts, seemingly a perfect hiding place to live out the rest of their days.

WHAT WORKS: As already stated ""The Bounty"" is the most historically accurate version. It also has the most realistic vibe, which isn't to say that the '62 version isn't believable, it's just that this '84 version strikes the viewer as completely REAL. It's almost as if the film takes you back in time to view the actual events.

This version also gives the most balanced and positive portrayal of the infamous Captain Bligh, played by Anthony Hopkins to great effect. Indeed the film stresses that he was exonerated in the matter. But it also hints of his character flaws that ultimately provoked the mutiny. In real life Bligh had a bad tempor and was abusive & insulting to his subordinates. The other two versions show an event that really happened on the Bounty: two big cheeses came up missing on the ship and Bligh unjustly blamed and punished members of his crew even though it was he himself that stold them!

Perhaps Bligh's biggest flaw was that he lacked the ability to inspire loyalty in others; by all accounts he was a real bastage to be around when he was in authority. Lending creedance to this is the fact that, even though he was exonerated in the Bounty case, he provoked ANOTHER mutiny years later in New South Wales, Australia!

Despite all this Bligh was certainly a brilliant seaman and navigator. The film shows this with Bligh and the 18 loyalists on the adrift launch. After failing to settle on near islands due to unfriendly natives, Bligh navigates the small craft over 3600 miles to Timor in 47 days on very few provisions. He didn't have any charts or compass. All he had was a sextant and a pocket watch. Although all of the loyalists survived this incredible journey 5 later died due to ailments sustained in the voyage. The '62 version barely addresses this miraculous event but ""The Bounty"" devotes quite a few scenes to it.

The score by Vangelis is very fitting. The best part of this composition is heard during the end credits. The film shows Fletcher, the mutineers and the Tahitians stranded on Pitcairn as they sadly observe
The Bounty go down in flames. They know they can never go home again. Vangelis' unique piece then plays out over the credits. It perfectly captures the mood and setting. It's so magnificent sometimes I just play the end credits sequence. It's definitely one of the most emotionally potent endings in motion picture history.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Although Gibson is more realistic as Fletcher Christian than Marlon Brando, especially since Gibson was closer to Christian's real age of 23-25 (Brando was 36-37 during filming), Mel simply lacks Brando's captivating charisma.

The Tahitian scenes seem to lack pizzazz; the film almost crawls to a halt (which is the the exact opposite of Brando's version). It doesn't personally bother me because the film is attempting to show us what leads to the mutineers' decision to take the ship, but some viewers may have a problem with it, in particular those with ADD.

""The Bounty"" also fails to give any glimpse of what life would offer the mutineers & Tahitians on Pitcairn Island. The '62 version, on the other hand, devotes a number of scenes to this part of the story. This is not a negative to me, however, since showing subsequent scenes on Pitcairn would ruin the powerful end sequence noted above.

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Bounty"" is the most historically accurate and realistic version of the infamous mutiny even though Brando's version is the most epic, engaging and compelling. I recommend seeing both versions back to back, which is what I usually do. Both versions are amongst my favorite films of all time. In fact, I consider them masterpieces.

The film runs 2 hours and 12 minutes; Brando's version is 3 hours.

THE FATE OF THE MUTINEERS: There was ample land, water and food for the 9 mutineers, 6 Tahitian men and 11 women on Pitcairn Island. Christian naturally became the established leader and many children were born. Although Fletcher treated the native men fairly, other mutineers treated them like servants and relations deteriorated. When John Williams' native wife died he took one of the Tahitian men's women as a ""replacement,"" which naturally caused the Polynesian men to revolt. This conflict took place 3.5 years after they arrived on Pitcairn. The result was that five of the mutineers died, including Christian, and all six of the Tahitian men. Of the four remaining mutineers, one died in a drunken fall and Quintal was killed by the other two after a drunken fit of rage. The remaining two mutineers had a bible from the ship and became devout Christians, converting the Tahitian women and children and holding regular church services. Peace and goodwill reigned in the colony. Ned Young died in 1800 of asthma leaving John Adams (aka Alex Smith), 9 women and 23 children to be discovered by an American whaling vessel in 1808. Adams was interestingly granted amnesty by the British government. Today Pitcairn is home to about 50 people from 9 families, most descendants of the mutineers and Tahitians. Many adherents of Seventh-Day Adventism due to a mission in the 1890s.",1196812800,38,7112,4.844444444444444

677188,5,630347151X,"By far, my favortie adventure drama film! My only complaint is the opening and background music. It could have used a rousing ""Gone with the Wind"" memorable theme song instead of the somber haunting music employed. I liked the back and forth switches between Bligh's official enquiry and the story of the Bounty. I don't agree with the too common assessment that Bligh and Christian were both deeply flawed men. This film succeeds in presenting them in a balanced manner. I believe Bligh was mostly a victim of a very unusual set of circumstances. Officially, he was only a first lieutenant, not a captain. Unlike normal crown ventures, he lacked commissioned officers and marines to back up his authority, a critical point the film fails to bring out. Apparently, there is no evidence to back up the implication that Bligh announced his intension to sail around Cape Horn, thus provoking the mutiny. It seems plain that the instigation for the mutiny had mainly to do with the very long(5 months) layover in a paradise of willing girls and relative leisure, which many of the crew, including Christian, preferred to continue over a return to naval drudgery and discipline and an ultimate return to England. Christian apparently, as the film dramatized, had also accumulated an intolerable load of recent brow beatings by Bligh. Apparently, he had considered suicide shortly before the mutiny as the only practical way out of his conflicting feelings, as the film may suggest. It is painfully obvious that the prudish aloof Bligh feels very unconfortable in the leisurely free love atmosphere of Tahiti that most of his men relish.  Thus, he seems to his crew a different species all together.
  I found this version of the Bounty story far superior to previous versions in terms of its characterization of Bligh and Christian and its overall realism. Anthony Hopkins was unbeatable as Bligh, and should have won an academy award. In contrast to some reviewers, I found Mel Gibson entirely adequate as the real Christian. Some prefer Gable's heroic rabble-rousing version of Christian which fit in with other 1930s swashbucking adventure tales. In terms of realism, it also helped that Gibson was much closer to the real Christian's age of 22 than either Gable or Brando.  A few reviewers object to the extensive realistic portrayal of bare-breasted nymphomaniac native maidens, something the strict codes of the mid-1930s wouldn't allow. I found this a definite plus and, having married to South Seas maiden, continue to enjoy the view when not watching this film.",1191024000,5,2565,5.0424528301886795

It seems that the movie protrayed Captain Bligh as the villain and Christian as the hero.  In reality, who was the bad guy?

Is it Bligh, who treated his men badly with an ""iron hand"" (but who acted within the law of the admirality) and kept Christian away from the one he loved the most?

I'll leave those for the viewer. In the end, Bligh comes off very well in this depiction, exonerated by the naval court of inquiry in London without reservation. The movie flashes back and forth from the testimony and story. No problem there. The plot lingers too long in the ""paradisio"" south sea island scenes. They had to get the characters in ""love"" [sex] affairs with the native women - and one in particular [Christian] takes up much too much time. Chief's daughter strikes out with Christian when Bligh finally rains on the parade. Bligh has his woman provided by the chief as well but he's a prude and lives the incompleted life [the Hollywood weltanschauung].

It's back to sea now fellows and Brit naval discipline sort of thing. Then the mutiny and back to the island for some more love [sex]. That doesn't go this time for the chief sees retribution from the Brits. Hollywood already had milked that one for all it was worth. On to Pitcairne Island, burn the ship, and settle.

Granted, it's a tad more historically accurate depiction of the Bounty then the other two films made of the story, but it still didn't get at the heart of it.  In this film, Captain Bligh is portrayed as more human, but that's really just in the beginning of the voyage.  After they leave Tahiti, he becomes deranged and obsessed.  No real explanation is given, and it seems the makers of the film resorted to the time worn ""good guy/bad guy"" stuff because it was easy and doesn't require much thought.  The actual story of the mutiny is quite complex.  Bligh was not at all mad, but actually quite benign, especially compared to the dastardly Captain Cook, who was as cruel as his reputation suggests, and to other sea captains of his time.  Bligh was considerably considerate towards his crew, doubling their rest periods, supervising their diet (to prevent scurvvy), and ensuring they had proper exercise (there is a scene in this film depicting that).  He was also a master seaman, managing one of the most extraordinary feats in navigational history, sailing 3618 miles in an open boat for 41 days.  This is depicted in the film, but it's really not given any real significance, probably because it would show Bligh in a positive light.  It is not really known exactly why there was a mutiny.  The most proper explanation is that Fletcher Christian fell in love with Tahiti (and a woman), and that Bligh was furious at the loss of discipline of his crew.  Originally, this film was supposed to be two films, both of epic length, directed by the great David Lean.  Robert Bolt wrote the scripts, and by all accounts, Bolt's original scripts were masterful.  But due to production delays, cost overruns, bad weather, etc., etc., Lean was never able to make the two films he envisioned.  He tried to get one film made, but that wasn't to be either.  Eventually Lean dropped out of the project, throwing his energy into his final film, A Passage to India.  The massive Bolt script was whittled down into a shorter version, and that's what was used for the film here.  The film feels like a greatest hits version of the Bounty, without any real nuance or deep character development.  The director here, Roger Donaldson, is no David Lean, and it shows.  His direction is very workmanlike, and ends up being stale and he doesn't give this film the epic sweep it so desperately needs.  The film also glosses over the fate of the mutineers.  In this film, it's implied that the mutineers lived in peace and harmony once they landed on Piticarin Island, but in fact, many of which died at the hands of the natives and the others were caught by English ships set out to find the mutineers, and they were all executed.  I would suggest reading books on this subject, rather than seeing the films, as none of them reach the complexities of the real story.",1173916800,4,2879,4.6686507936507935

The movie also stars a young Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson - before either was a really big-name star.  None other than Sir Laurence Olivier portrays the admiral who sits in judgment of captain Bligh.

I saw a documentary on the HMS BOUNTY that was shown on the History channel.  This movie is pretty darned accurate in its depiction of what actually happened.  There was not a whole lot that was Hollywoodized in it, which is rare for an historical movie these days.

The trek of some 2,000 miles over the ocean in an open boat that Bligh & his men had to undertake remains to this day one of the most brilliant feats in maritime history.  Without charts or navigation instruments, Bligh got the boat to safe harbor using nothing more than the stars for direction.  Some may believe that this part of the film was fabricated - it was not.  The journey really WAS that perilous.

I do have one note for parents:  the PG Rating is a bit mis-leading.  There are gorgeous Tahiti women who frolick around topless once they reach the island.  Needless to say, I don't object to this, but parents may want to take caution.  I realize the makers of the film believed it to be nudity in a NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC sort of way, but these women are gorgeous!

This is a much, much better account of the fascinating tale of the Bounty than the crude over-simplifications of the Gable/Laughton and Brando/Howard versions, although both of those are highly watchable movies in their own right. The perennial question about this episode in Britain's naval history is why did this mutiny actually happen? There is no clear or obvious answer: after all, hundreds of British ships ruled the waves for many decades without mutinies, many of them under far more gruelling and cruel conditions than the Bounty. This film surely comes closest to truly understanding the unique factors that led to the fateful insurrection, and it seems to boil down to a strange and unfortunate mixture of human personalities and very unusual physical circumstances. Bligh's major disastrous error appears to have been his desire to round the Horn, which led to a domino effect of mounting problems in achieving the original purpose of the voyage. The film doesn't make it properly clear that the ship was actually delayed for 5 whole months on Tahiti, in order to fit in with the seasonal vagaries of the breadfruit plants.

Some other peculiar flaws in the screenplay have been picked up by another reviewer. There seems to have been no truth at all in the idea that Bligh again wanted to sail round the Horn on his return voyage; and there seems no purpose in introducing the scene of Bligh lying to the King of Tahiti about the death of Captain Cook --- although the record may show that he did do this. What the film does make very clear is that Bligh was certainly never a cruel tyrant, and also that he was exonerated for having allowed the mutiny to happen. He seems to have been a man of sensitivity, courage and intelligence, who wanted to manage his men according to good principles. However, he lacked the human touch and charisma to inspire loyalty. His genuine abilities came to the fore in his astounding open-boat voyage of nearly 7,000 km, more remarkable even than the mutiny that caused it. Fletcher Christian was basically a weak character, who allowed himself to be manipulated by malcontents. The hysterical scenes of the actual mutiny are extremely well portrayed in the film. The actors all perform excellently, and it is good to see Gibson in a restrained, well-judged role, before his downward spiral, from Braveheart onwards, into one ghastly, untruthful movie after another.",1167955200,2,2500,4.966587112171838

Reviewers of this movie (on Amazon, at least) seem to think that his glazed stare throughout most of the film reflects some deep inner torment; I thought it just looked like a glazed stare, angled perfectly for the cameras. Jeeze, even I could have done that (of course, I wouldn't look as good, but it's still not acting, no matter who does it). Yes, Gibson does yell a little when the mutiney finally happens, but by then I don't believe it, because he hasn't given us any character development. Either that, or he's playing his character for schizoid. Go figure.

Brando, on the other hand, is brilliant in the 1962 version. Playing a dandy of sorts at the beginning, his character builds throughout the movie, and we're allowed to watch the evolution and conflict with interest and anticipation. When the mutiney does happen, we believe it. Brando's Fletcher Christian is three dimensional, Gibson's is a cardboard cutout.

While Anthony Hopkins is almost always great, Trevor Howard (in the 1962 film) is equal, if not superior, in the role of Captain Bligh. Hopkins is more sympathetic, Howard is simply evil. The actors play the role differently; they both work.

Of course, there are a lot more beautiful Tahitian women (and exposed [...]) in Gibson's Bounty, so that's worth a point or two (though Brando's Bounty is suprisingly lush for it's time). But on acting alone, there's no comparison; Brando wins easily. Unless you go for the brooding, modelish Gibson sort of thing. But again, that's not acting. That's preening.

One (or two) other things:
1) I like Gibson. It just doesn't work here.
2) Also, - I ""forced"" my 20 and 15 year old kids to watch the 1962 film, and they were totally caught up in it after the first 20 minutes. This, from 2 kids who love comtemporary movies but will not have anything to do with anything as far back as the 60's.

Watch both, then decide.",1161648000,2,2251,4.732142857142857

A rather easy choice to make, military service or life on the beach. I think I would want to be back on that island too.

Technically and artistically a first class production, yet it still only earns 4 out of 5 stars. I found the pace of the film to be rather slow, particularily in the onboard ship sequences. It was when they are on the island amidst all the natural beauty and splendor of nature and the native girls that the movies best moments are found. I also found the ending to be rather abrupt, leaving the viewer with the feeling that something is missing.

677310,5,630347151X,"The Bounty is an adventure/drama set on the high seas and the islands of the South Pacific Ocean. The story documents the plight of an ambitious British Navy lieutenant, William Bligh, who is placed in charge of HMS Bounty and sent around the world on a voyage to cultivate Breadfruit trees in  Tahiti, and sail them to Jamaica as food for slaves. He accepts the task, if only to prove himself for promotion as a Captain, and in doing so he asks his friend and fellow seaman, Fletcher Christian, to join him on the voyage.

Like all great characters, Bligh is a flawed character who leads with his ego and at the best of times his leadership skills are quite inconsistent. For a British Naval officer who's word is law, this is a problem. He is among a seasoned crew of sailors who observe his ever move and when he falters he cracks the whip of discipline. Not a good leader as many would attest to. So when his officers and men fall into the seductive spell and love culture of Tahiti and his friend Fletcher Christian falls in love with the daughter of the Polynesian Chief,  Bligh finds himself in the predicament of having to bring law and order back to the workings of the Bounty

Perhaps the British Navy should have taught a little psychology in leadership to potential Captains, but it wasn't around in those days so Bligh's discipline methods as a leader were harsh and hateful. And Mr. Bligh looses his ship to a mutiny.

This is the first film about the mutiny to be told from the Captain's point of view. Instead of vilifying the Captain's attitude we begin to understand his needs for discipline if not his methods for achieving them. Anthony Hopkins is great as the anxious William Bligh. And I think this is one of Mel Gibson's best performances as an actor. Other parts go to Liam Neeson as a devilish crew member and Daniel Day Lewis as the first officer.

The wide screen photography is breath-taking, transporting us on a voyage to another world of spectacular, beautiful places.

While I love the music composition of Vangelis, I find listening to the sounds of modern electronic synthesizers while watching the voyage of a wooden boat from 1789 a distraction. Seems they could have hired an orchestra to bring the quality of Vangelis's fine musical score to life.",1127692800,3,2285,4.62716049382716
677311,5,630347151X,"Deftly directed by Roger Donaldson and beautifully acted, this is a well nuanced film. Based upon a true story and adapted from the book, ""Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian"", by Richard Hough, the film relates the series of events that brought about the eventual mutiny of the English vessel, The Bounty, by its crew. The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian, the Master's Mate, and friend of Lt. William Bligh, Captain of the ship. The film opens with the trial of Captain Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) before the Admiralty Board, where he is questioned by Captain Greetham (Edward Fox) and Admiral Hood (Laurence Olivier). Captain Bligh then relates his account of why it was that he lost a ship under his command.

The star-crossed voyage of ""The Bounty"" started innocuously enough. Captain William Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) convinced his friend, Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson), to set sail with him as Master's Mate to Ship Master John Fryer (Daniel Day Lewis). ""The Bounty"" was commissioned to set sail for Tahiti in order to obtain breadfruit plants for transport to Jamaica. In order to save time, the Captain would navigate a little used route around the horn of Africa to save time. It was to be a voyage to remember.

During the voyage, the viewer sees the tension build amongst the crew, as well as amongst the officers. The innate savagery and baseness of some of the seamen is personified by Charles Churchill (Liam Neeson), a seaman who needs little provocation. The disdain of the officers for the crew is best exemplified by John Fryer, the ship's Master, who seems to relish the cruelty of the punishments meted out to those crewmen found guilty of infractions. Tension then spills over between the crew and officers, as the rigors of the voyage eats away at morale. By the time the ship reaches Tahiti, the die is cast. Months on the lovely island creates a false reality and an indolence that sets the stage for what is to come. Fletcher's erotic romance with a Tahitian princess further erodes discipline and strains the friendship between Bligh and Christian. By the time they finally shove off and set sail back to England with the breadfruit plants that they had sought, the end is near.

Mel Gibson does a superb job with the role of Fletcher Christian. The viewer first sees him as an ambitious, yet kindly young man, who, having weathered the rigors and cruelties of the voyage, finds romance and peace on the idyllic island of Tahiti. Setting sail to return home and once again encountering the rigors and reality of a sea voyage, Christian seems to be a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown. With morale low among the crew, he makes a life defining decision. The rest is history.

Anthony Hopkins is simply brilliant in the role of William Bligh. Playing him as a hard working, by the book captain, he creates a three dimensional character that is sympathetic. Betrayed by friendship and beset by the fates, Bligh manages to pull together and save those men who were cast adrift in a dinghy with him. Masterful and mindful of his professional obligations, he makes an astounding voyage, believable because of the qualities of character infused in him by Hopkins' portrayal. The viewer senses, however, that he will forever be at a loss to comprehend Christian's actions.

This is a visually beautiful film, with stunningly lush island scenes. There is an original musical score by Vangelis that is wonderfully atmospheric. The performances by the cast are superlative. What more could a film lover ask for? Bravo!",1124236800,,3535,4.865448504983389

He acted out the nice guy part and the bad guy part seemlessly. I love the music in this film, especially the music over the ending credits. I was greatly dissapointed when I found out that the music faded out at the end of the credits.

677313,5,630347151X,"How could a film with Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins, Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson sink without trace? That was the fate of Roger Donaldson's The Bounty back in 1984 when none of them were exactly box-office certainties. Indeed, the third dramatization of the British Navy's most infamous act of piracy (excluding the semi-documentary In the Wake of the Bounty) and is perhaps best remembered today as the flop that David Lean nearly directed before falling out with Dino De Laurentiis (UA studio boss Steven Bach infamously greenlit Heaven's Gate instead of a Lean version!). It certainly deserves to be better remembered, boasting a superb screenplay by Robert Bolt (originally intended as two films: the second, dealing with the aftermath was quietly dropped after this tanked) that owes a lot more to history than previous versions despite its occasional inaccuracies.

A young Mel Gibson impresses as the weak Fletcher Christian, drawn into rebelling more by place and circumstances than a catalogue of tyranny, but it's Anthony Hopkins' film all the way. Before his irretrievable descent into ham he was a much more restrained screen actor, and his Captain Bligh is a much more interesting creation than you suspect he'd manage today. Fighting his own demons in a permissive place that rips away the moral repressions of his crew and creates a culture of defiance and inertia that he is unable to combat by either understanding or discipline (if anything, Bligh's fault here is that he is too slack on the men for too long before disastrously overcompensating on the return voyage), the film is punctuated by images of his desperately haunted face as he is faced with the realization of his escalating failure and impotence. Yet it is ultimately Bligh who triumphs and is vindicated in this version, with Christian and his mutineers left at each other's throats as they are cast out of paradise and stranded on a barren shore.

It's impressive, powerful stuff, even more so today for its reality. No cgi, few model shots, they built a real ship and took it to sea for real (even Master and Commander was almost entirely shot in a studio tank in Mexico), and the hardships and efforts pay dividends on screen. Donaldson's direction is better than anything he's done since, Arthur Ibbetson's cinematography impressive and even Vangelis' much maligned score has some of the psychological savagery you can find in Alex North's work on Spartacus. Only a hammy Edward Fox (sparingly used, thankfully) and a superanuated Laurence Olivier strike the odd bum note in the court of inquiry scenes that provide the film's solid framework. I for one would love to see the second Bolt script, The Long Arm, finally make it to the screen some day - hard to believe, but it's a much better tale by far.",1121817600,6,2793,4.940425531914894
677314,4,630347151X,"Mel Gibson is appealing and charismatic as Fletcher Christian.  Much more so than the 1935 version, Donaldson's BOUNTY depicts the mutiny as a clash in values arising from Britain's hidebound class system, with Fletcher Christian the Cavalier and Captain Bligh the Roundhead, Christian the noble bohemian and Bligh the civil servant obnssesed with getting head in the world by hook or by crook, a man with a vision so small he can't see the big picture.  In the 1935 version, you'd imagine that Clark Gable came from a lower class than Charles Laughton, but here it's all so clear.  Casting Olivier as the one of the officers on the impugning admiralty panel was a stroke of genius (besides giving the movie that touch of class) in the way that he clearly cannot understand Hopkins' Uriah Heep-style singlemindedness.

David Lean wanted to make this movie in the late 1970s and he had the boat made to his specifications years before.  Robert Bolt's script was originally written in two parts, THE LAWBREAKERS and THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW, and Lean spent four years trying to get Warner Brothers to back him properly.  When Bolt had a stroke, Lean despaired of ever being allowed to make the picture he wanted to, and abandoned his sketches and went on to think about his alternative project, Forster's PASSAGE TO INDIA.  In the meantime, severely cheaper director Roger Donaldson was given Bolt's script and asked to make a single picture from it.

He showed a Lean-like appreciation of nature vs. civilization, the photographer's eye, even a Lean-like casting sense, with early appearances by Liam Neeson and Daniel Day Lewis.  Hopkins gives the picture its gravitas, Gibson its glamor.  He is crazy good looking in this part, a true successor to Gable and Brando.  Funny how he plays a fellow called ""Christian"" in this movie, and then got all Christian in real life!  Be careful what you wish for.",1120780800,,1900,4.848297213622291

The mystery of what actually happened on the bounty is told is a series of incidents leading up to, and after that fatal day.  What is lacking is the reason why the men were kept in such idleness when the bottom of the cutter had rotted, and why they did not further chart islands around the area as the gardners prepared the breadfruit for shipping.  As hard as this version tries to extract a shred of justification for Christian, it fails to consider life of a ""jack"" on the high seas in one of HMS ships during the 18 Century.  4 stars are for adventure.",1111708800,3,636,4.364406779661017
677316,4,630347151X,"Wow!  What a great high seas adventure.  Countless times retold and in as many ways, The Bounty is the ultimate portrayal of life aboard the Armed Vessel Bounty.  An all-star cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Liam Neeson and Sir Lawrence Olivier navigate this film through it's stormy storyline of loyalty lost and mutiny found.

Mel Gibson brings a career-best performance as British Naval Officer Fletcher Christian, who has agreed to sail to Tahiti aboard The Bounty under the command of Lt. William Bligh (Hopkins).  Their friendship comes undone as Bligh becomes increasingly intolerant of his crew's behavior while at port in Tahiti.  Christian leads a mutiny and sets Bligh adrift.  In spite of starvation, thirst and bad sunburn, Bligh demonstates his naval supremacy by sailing his dinghy to a French port, thereby saving himself and the few men who would not mutiny.  Christian eventually contends with a near-mutinous crew of his own before finding Pitcairns Island, his final port-of-call before his uncertain demise.

Let me just say that the cinematography of this movie is magical.  The scenes at sea and in Tahiti are absolutely beautiful.  Hopkins plays convincingly as an over-achieving, demanding ship's Captain.  And, contrary to a couple of reviewers, I absolutely loved the musical score by Vangelis.  It provided a hauntingly mesmerising theme to the adventure and danger of crossing vast seas in the 1700's.

Well worth watching, this film, 20+years old, is still one of the best naval-themed movies ever.  I found it more exciting than Master and Commander.  And, the fact it's based on a true story makes it even more irresistable.  4+stars.",1110585600,5,1678,5.201492537313433
677347,5,630347151X,"This movie manages to portray Lieutenant Bligh in a sympathetic and much more historically accurate light. Instead of the 'control freak' monster portrayed in earlier films, we see a man with poor interpersonal skills who is nevertheless trying to be a good leader. After the mutiny, Bligh, along with some loyal followers, was cast adrift on the open ocean to face what was an almost certain death. However, the mutineers did not appreciate just what an excellent seaman and navigator Bligh was. Thanks to his outstanding abilities, the small boat was steered across thousands of miles of sea to eventual safety. The director has portrayed this part of the movie particularly well and, even knowing the outcome, there is still a palpable tension felt by the viewer.
Roger Donaldson has focused on the difficulties of ship life during the 1700's and shown the tensions that can so easily arise living such a precarious life. Tensions that, in the case of the Bounty, led to the infamous mutiny. The cinematography is excellent, you could really believe a camera was following the ship and crew around Cape Horn, and nothing has been lost in transferring it to DVD. The picture is clear and the colours well saturated.
Featuring such names as Anthony Hopkins (Bligh), Mel Gibson (Christian), Liam Neeson and Daniel Day Lewis, to name but a few, this is a film that is well worth watching. The hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack by Vangelis adds to the experience.",1108166400,4,1461,4.96734693877551
677348,5,630347151X,"What I really like about this movie is that it doesn't portray a right and wrong party. Both Capt. Bligh and Fletcher Christian are portrayed as decent human beings. Neither is the villain in the movie. One can equally easily argue that one or the other is right.

One can claim that the mutineers should've acted more professionally, obeyed the captain, and not gotten too involved in Tahiti life (particularly with the women). However, one can also argue that the Captain Bligh was morally wrong in commanding the crew to cross Cape Horn, thereby risking their lives, for a mission that required no need for that (transporting of plants), just so that the captain would look good.",1104969600,5,682,4.829059829059829

The suspense is high on two levels--1. when will Christian and the seamen become so enraged that they will flout Hopkins' order and mutiny, and 2. what will be the final judgement on Hopkins in the trial being conducted on whether or not he was responsible for the mutiny. As the story develops, the suspense keeps intensifying and escalating.

I think Hopkins and Gibson played their parts much better than did Howard and Brando. Hopkins expressed many levels of the Bligh character, showing the inner conflict that gripped him--i.e., trying to be fair and human to the seamen and yet needing to exercise stern discipline to enable the ship to accomplish its purpose. His acting was absolutely marvelous, showing how he was being torn apart while at the same time trying to maintain his sanity. However, in the Howard version, all we see is a viciously sadistic personality--one note--without much depth or dimension. Gibson's performance was also excellent as his tension and anger gradually build to a breaking point, but even here he refrained from exerting the violence that he could have. You can't help but sympathize with him.

There are many touching moments in the story that make this a most memorable film. I was never bored or uninterested for even a moment--the suspense and drama just kept building and developing as I eagerly wondered how the story would finally end.

677350,4,630347151X,"I've not seen either preceding version of Mutiny on the Bounty (neither Gable's nor Brando's) so my review reflects only  the value of this flick independant of how it may compare with it's antecedents.
On the whole, this is a compelling movie.
It's creators understood the value of embodying two polarizing forces within the same character or situation. By exploiting that tension, you create real drama. It's a simple formula, but easier said then done.
Fortunately both Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins are able to pull it off elegantly and seamlessly.
Gibson is simultaneously pulled by both the responsibility of loyalty and the passion that any vital man possesses.
Hopkins is divided by both the egoists desire to create a legacy and the LACK of male vitality that usually fuels such desires.
Of the two, Hopkins part is much tougher, yet he captures it in all it's poetic sadness.
In watching a conflict like this, everyone has to chose a side. I relate much more to Gibson, his disloyalty notwithstanding, as he allowed himself to be led more by power than form. (And I saw this before Mel became one of my all time great heroes for his phenomenal work in THE PASSION.)
Hopkins was an old man in the dark days of pre-Viagra civilization. He just didn't have any mojo left and his men sensed that.
Given that he was cooped up in a boat with ALL MEN for countless days, it boggles the mind that ANY man would not feel he had found absolute paradise when landing on Tahiti and all that it offered. And I mean ALL.
Mel of course understood exactly what they had swung into and, given his game, quickly began enjoying it to it's fullest.
That is essentially what this movie is about. The conflict between true, perhaps even raw passion and an old decaying passion limping along on it's last pathetic leg  while attempting to provide some subtext for it's existence.
Two best scenes:
1) Mel and his Tahitian bride coming together for the first time.
2) The bitter tears shed by Mel's father-in-law as his daughter chose to go with Mel rather than remain with him.
BTW - I don't know why the last 3 reviewers of this film are all from the Ann Arbor/Plymouth Michigan area. Perhaps we just enjoy tropical climates more than others around the country!",1088812800,4,2249,4.662468513853904
677351,4,630347151X,"This isn't a simple retelling of the story of the ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" with a vicious Captain Bligh and a troubled, but virtuous Mr. Christian saving the crew from unbearable cruelty.  This is a much better story.
The movie begins at the trial at the Admiralty of Lieutenant Bligh for losing the HMS Bounty.  The movie flashes back to the story from this trial periodically.  This device allows the movie to focus on key points in a story that takes place over well more than a year without having to try and keep a strict narrative together.
Bligh has been assigned to go to Tahiti to get Breadfruit plants and take them to Jamaica to provide cheaper feed for the slaves and while he is doing that he wants to circumnavigate the globe - a career-making move in 1787.  Assigned to Bligh as first mate is John Fryer who is doubtful about going round the Horn off the southern tip of South America that is noted for its mighty storms.  Bligh brings along his friend Fletcher Christian as the officer after John Fryer.
After they finally reach Tahiti and negotiate to get the breadfruit, they have to wait for them to grow.  They are there many months longer than expected and the men get attached to the local women who are mostly bare breasted and very agreeable companions.  Discipline breaks down.
Bligh remains above all the fraternization, but has a hard time pulling the crew back together and as they set sail for home he applies harsh discipline to get the crew back into fit condition and sets a course that upsets the men.  Christian has his own resentments and torn loyalties, but does lead the crew in mutiny and sets Bligh adrift in a small open launch (it was only 23 foot long and 6 foot 9 inches wide).  Bligh's courage and magnificent seamanship got them through the 3,618 nautical mile journey without loss of life in 47 days.  The movie isn't quite accurate about the survival of all the crew.
Christian goes back to Tahiti but is forbidden to stay.  The mutineers and some Tahitians end up on a then unknown island and their descendants live there to this day.
This movie was made in 1984 as a vehicle for Mel Gibson's charisma and blazing stardom.  He is charismatic and has some good lines and does them well.  His Christian is torn, but also self indulgent and sometimes petulant without much discipline.  The star of this movie, and becomes more so each time I see it, is Anthony Hopkins playing Captain Bligh.  He is wonderful in this role.  His characterization is quite complex.  His Bligh is a good man without charisma who tries to hold order with a discipline that becomes harsher as the men resist.  In this movie there isn't a single villain with good guys, it is a confluence of flaws in all the characters that leads to the breakdown.
My favorite portion of the movie is in the open launch.  I find those scenes particularly powerful.
My least favorite aspect of the movie is the musical score by Vangelis.  He was a hot commodity in the early 1980's having done ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""Blade Runner"" (his most effective score).  Here it gives a strange quality to a movie taking place in the 18th century.  This is especially so since there are large portions of the movie without background music and when the synthesizers come in they are too noticeable.  For me, and maybe not for you, but for me, it makes the movie sound too much like ""Blade Runner"".  It is a small point, however.  This is a very good movie.",1088208000,3,3449,4.542071197411003
677352,3,630347151X,"I must say that this is the first film or book I've been fully exposed to concerning the Bounty and its men.  I was drawn to this DVD primarily because of my secret love affair with Mel Gibson (he doesn't know about it; that's what makes it secret).
But I was hoping the story would be exciting and well-written too.  Except for very good acting by a number of persons, including Wi Kuki Kaa as the king of Tahiti and father of Christian Fletcher (Gibson)'s love interest (That little--never mind.)Considering both Gibson and Sir Anthony can act with both hands tied behind their back balancing a dolphin on their heads, I was not surprised by the  characterizations of Mssrs. Bligh and Christian--a ray of light in the film.  The scenery is magnificent, and the storm scenes exciting. But rather than sail, it floundered.
My problem with this film was believability.  In short, since the overall theme was a cruel ship's master driving his first mate and others to mutiny, I expected to find Bligh's character to be some shade of ruthless.  I also thought he was supposed to run the ship with obsessive authoritarianism, carping at the crew for the slightest departure from English decorum.  A scene of the crew dancing reluctantly to a fiddle tune (the world's first aerobics class!) certainly exhibited a difference between captain and crew as to what they thought sailors should be doing.  But is that any different than drills current people in the service (whether in Britain or elsewhere) are told to do?  At any rate, the dance ""class"" seemed more the idea and for the enjoyment of the 3rd in command, who seemed to get a lot of joy out of it, not the captain, who looked on nervously.
It was only after several people had deserted, his first mate directly disobeyed orders, and all the sailors were involved in behavior not appropriate for officers to be doing in public, that he really made waves.
But that is part of the problem, too.  Up until that point, the movie seemed like an apologia for Bligh.  But after he did get fed up to the gills, ordering cruel punishments for small infractions, and re-ordering the ship back through a dangerous zone for his own glory, that didn't seem the case. Note, however, that all this occurred after the mutineers were hatching their plot. Neither Bligh nor Christian come out smelling like an anenome in this seafaring tale.
This would have been a fine movie to rent.  It's exciting at points, beautiful, and romantic.  But as a story, it does not hang together well.  I would not recommend shelling out any fins to buy it.

677353,5,630347151X,"The movie is excellent, but that is all you get on the DVD.  The only extra is a grainy theatrical trailer.  There is an abundance of supplemental material that could have been included.  I've seen several documentaries about the Bounty mutiny and Pitcairn Island that would have made great extras for the DVD.  In particular is a New Zealand made documentary, ""A Fated Ship,"" that shows the construction of the replica Bounty that was used in this movie.  It is a fascinating story.  The replica was built for a set of two movies that were to be directed by David Lean (""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"") and produced by Dino de Laurentis.  Lean dropped out of the project and De Laurentis was stuck with a full-sized, completely accurate replica of the Bounty.  This documentary is far superior to the short, publicity fluff pieces that pass for ""documentaries"" on too many DVDs. But nothing like that is provided.

There is so much history associated with story of the Bounty that the potential for special features is vast.  I would really like something like ""A Fated Ship"" or the Australian documentary about HMS Pandora, the frigate sent to retrieve the mutineers.  But even a commentary track or a ""behind-the-scenes"" featurette would have been better than nothing.

It seems doubtful, but perhaps ""The Bounty"" will get a decent DVD release someday with a suitable suite of extras.",1085011200,6,1407,4.8655462184873945

All concerned do admirably in this retelling with Hopkins particularly stealing the show with his pitch perfect, multi demensional performance.
Only the score by ""Vangelis"" reminds you that this is a film from the 1980s, with its synthesizer-heavy twang.  It would be wonderful to have this rescored with more period appropriate music.

677355,5,630347151X,"In an excellent dramatic portrayal of a young man in conflict, Mel Gibson as Fletcher Christian must choose the life he has always known or actions that betray his code of honor.
Anthony Hopkins is Captain Bly.  Perhaps the cruelty of the times caused him to treat his men so harshly, perhaps it was the code of the Royal Navy in order to maintain discipline, but either way Hopkins pulled it off perfectly.  I thought how these early rolls gave him the power to play Hannibal Lecter so well in later films.
There is no way to judge the actions of a mutineer by today's standards, but I agreed with Fletcher Christion for the leniency toward the crew that would have kept the ship in tact and in the Master's command.  Beatings, whippings, hitting a man on his bare buttox while is sprawled over a cannon, and depriving the men of the freedom they had been granted for over three months on Tahiti set the captain up for the mutiny.
How could men who had not been all that happy with a captain consumed to circumnavigate the globe on his personal quest, thereby bringing them in grave danger, be trusted?  This was particularly true when this captain punished men for simply speaking out -- not against him -- but with questions about his command to return to Cape Horn where they had all nearly died in a bitter 31 day battle against the sea, which had won.  They did not make it around Cape Horn the first time when their crew was full and energetic.  Though he was warned privately by his First Mate, he still refused to listen.
This is also a love story about men who fell in love with their native wives and did not want to lose them.  Had they not followed the captain's orders to return to the boat, without further shore leave, they would have been flogged or shot.  Perhaps if Captain Bly had not been so rigid and Puritanical, this story would never have happened, but it is as alive and full of questions now as it was then.
This is a deep story.  The acting is excellent.  Five Stars.

677407,4,630347151X,"The Bounty is an excellent movie that tells the story of the mutiny on the Bounty with a different spin.  The H.M.S. Bounty is sent to Tahiti to pick up bread plants to bring to Jamaica so the slaves there can be fed for cheap.  As well, the Bounty and its crew will circumvent the world while completing their mission.  At first, the Bounty's mission goes off perfectly but soon enough problems arise as tension develops between Lt. William Bligh and First Officer Fletcher Christian.  After watching Bligh mistreat the crew, Christian decides he has seen enough and takes matters into his own hand.  This story has already been done twice but this one has a much different tone to it.  There is something unexplainable about the movie, but it is still very good.  The musical score by Vangelis is very well placed to show the rising tension as the confrontation between the two men draws nearer.
  Mel Gibson is very good as First Officer Fletcher Christian.  Taking the role played by both Clark Gable and Marlon Brando is not easy, but he steps into the role very well.  Anthony Hopkins' performance as Lt. William Bligh is equally as good.  This Bligh is much more sympathetic than Charles Laughton or Trevor Howard although he is very unlikable when he finally does crack.  Laurence Olivier and Edward Fox are excellent as two officers at Bligh's trial trying to find out what went wrong.  The film also stars Daniel-Day Lewis, Liam Neeson, and Bernard Hill in good roles.  The DVD offers the widescreen presentation and a theatrical trailer.  This is a very enjoyable movie with an excellent cast and beautiful cinematography in the Tahitian islands.

677409,5,630347151X,"I have always been a fan and a supporter of this underrated classic since the week of its release in 1984.  It opened to mixed critical and public reaction, but I think it deserves a new look.  For one, I think it tells the story of the Mutiny better and more convincingly than the 1935 Laughton/Gable film.  Whereas the original movie mostly had an American cast, an American production, American accents, and a humorous 20th century toungue-in-cheek tone (that renders that ancient movie inaccurate and unwatchable),  THE BOUNTY utilizes an English cast, and takes a more serious tone.  Ultimately, the cast for the Bounty is more believable as British seamen who lived in the 18th century.
As far as the storyline is concerned, THE BOUNTY tells its side of the story well.  Bligh as portrayed as an authoritarian leader who has to deal with a crew of insubordinates, led by a lovestruck Christian.  Their stay in Tahiti among the native population changes the mood of the crew.  But Bligh knows what the true mission of his voyage, and tries (but fails) to remind his men that they are really transporters of breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica.  Ultimately, Bligh's onscreen rages are convincing (whereas the 1935 version portrays Bligh's behavior as the whims of a crazy old man).  The climax of the film, the mutiny itself, is very well done, as the tempers of all involved come to the surface.
There is no denying the exquisite look to this film, and it is better served on the big screen. The period dress is impeccable, and it gives the film a historically accurate tone.  What actually happened between Bligh and Christian in 1787 may remain a mystery forever, but I feel that THE BOUNTY is the ultimate and most satisfying statement of the information left for us.",1065916800,6,1780,4.784313725490196

This film has long periods of inactivity and seems to concentrate more on the Tahiti girls than the conflict between Bligh and Christian.  It also seems to think that it's necessary to show nudity to draw and audience.  While probably accurate, it seems gratuitous and out of place in the story of the stuggle between Bligh and Christian.  Furthermore, this story's tendentious attitude towards Captain Bligh makes Christian look like he mutinied just to sleep with the topless girls on Tahiti.  The causes of the mutiny are much better developed in the 1962 version with Marlon Brando and it has better writing as well. The 1962 film also presents the situation from a much more neutral position.

I found Anthony Hopkins to be much more believable as Captain Bligh, stern, determined, militaristic and difficult, but not crazy! Fletcher Christian, from what i have read in history, mutinied because he had the hots for a Tahitian girl, plain and simple. Bligh was exhonerated of all charges and later, i believe became a governor of Austrailia. This film is an exellent portrayal of the story of the mutiny.

On the other hand, I watched Mel Gibson in a performance from twenty years ago (1983) and I was amazed at his versatility and subtlety. He is outstanding in his role as Fletcher Christian. He is thorougly convincing in his transition from London Bon Vivant (lover of fine wine and living) to love sick South Pacific/Polynesian convert. I felt sad for Gibson because his most recent portrayals involve confident heroic characters whom lack the sensitivity of the Fletcher Christian character portrayal.

The story is told very well, and the acting is convincing. But it did not, I feel, fulfill its potential. There are lots of close-ups and tense scenes within confined spaces, which indicates, to me, that the director was attempting to psychologically analyze the events on board the Bounty, but it seems to fail, nevertheless, to plumb the emotional depths of the characters.

677476,3,630347151X,"Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins star as Master's Mate Fletcher Christian and Captain Lt. William Bligh in this story of the ill-fated Bounty in 1787.  The mutiny of the Bounty is of course a historically documented fact and oft-told tale.  Here the story is told with extended flash-backs from Bligh's perspective, with his court martial being the framework of the movie.  Bligh's failure to successfully round Cape Horn not only frustrated his ambitions to circumnavigate the globe, but also incensed his crew to rebellion.  He becomes increasingly isolated from Christian and the rest of his crew, and when a lengthy stay at the island paradise of Tahiti is over, he finds himself with a mutiny on his hands.  Hopkins' performance as Bligh is outstanding and sympathetic.  He shows how Bligh's devotion to his ambition verges on madness, and his tears at the climax when he is exonerated become all the more powerful in view of the careful control of his emotions throughout the movie.  The movie features a good soundtrack from Vangelis with much that seems to be ripped off from his stunning ""1492 Conquest of Paradise"" score, and although it doesn't quite match the brilliance of that project it does enhance the suspense and action beautifully.

The movie gained a PG rating due to several scenes of violence (such as a fight amongst the crew, the mutiny itself, a vicious flogging, and an attack by savages), frightening scenes (the ship during the storm) and half a dozen instances of blasphemy.  There is also a great deal of sexual content: an over-abundance of half-naked bare-breasted Tahiti natives, several incidents of crude sexual talk, and obviously implied sexual orgies between the male crew and the Tahiti women.

While the sexual content is a major distraction, it is also major theme of the movie.  ""What made them so easy to corrupt?"" a question articulated by one of the characters, is the dominant question that drives the plot, and is actually the question for which Bligh is being tried.  Bligh's exoneration shows that the cause doesn't lie in him.  But the suggested answer ""the place itself"" is not entirely accurate, although it unquestionably was a catalyst for the corruption of the crew.  The island of Tahiti becomes like the ancient Island of Lesbos, where men are unable to escape the clutches of beautiful women.  Tahiti has the lure of a sinful Paradise, and becomes a symbol of pure and unlimited hedonism: food, wine, women and song.  The local girls give freely, and the men can give their primitive instincts free reign, by abandoning all sense of duty and responsibility, and following human passions in a grand display of infidelity and lust.  Fletcher Christian leads the way with his seduction of the island king's young daughter.  Captain Bligh is the exception who resists temptation and remains faithful to his duty, but in the process is presented as weak and foolish.  But as the journey to Tahiti shows, actually the seeds of dissent, corruption and ruin were already present in the hearts of the men before they even arrived at the island paradise.

Although the hedonism is initially painted as a Paradise and presented rather positively, in the final analysis viewers must come to a different conclusion about the collapse of discipline, confirmed by Bligh's exoneration and the harsh facts of the consequences of unbridled corruption.  Ultimately it is not just Bligh, but the sensuous passions of mankind that are on trial.  When people are set free from the apparent bondage of law and authority (represented by Bligh), eventually sin self-destructs and leads to its own ruin.  The mutineers must live with the consequences of their actions, and conclude their days in loneliness on Pitcairn Island, never to see England again.  This of course, is the true story of the Bounty which everyone already knows.  But this isolation becomes almost a metaphor for hell: giving free reign to their passions on the Tahiti paradise has ultimately proven to lead not to heaven but a hellish isolation.  Ultimately it is the depravity of the human heart that has led to this ruin.  Although ""The Bounty"" doesn't show the answer to this ruin in the gospel, this true story shows the folly of depraved human passions and demonstrates that the Paradise which these passions seek is an illusion, and eventually leads to ruin.  Certainly this is a message worth learning, but I doubt that such a vivid and unedifying picture of depravity is necessary in order to learn it. - GODLY GADFLY",1042588800,26,4528,4.96158940397351

Since the 1981 Ocasr winning film Chariots Of Fire, the audience in the United States did not see a remarkable film from the United Kingdom Of Great Britian for some time. When The Bounty hit the big screen in 1984, the long wait had ended. And this film would go down in history as the best and most accurate adaptation of the historical mutiny.
Filmed on location in New Zealand, Polynesia, London, and at Pinewood Studios in England, Roger Donaldson definately put the material he had been given to very good use. Robert Bolt, who wrote the screenplay also did his research well. With such leading actors as Mel Gibson, Sir Anthony Hopkins, the late Sir Lawrence Olivier, Daniel Day Lewis, Liam Neeson, and countless others...this film was a box office winner. The cinema-photography was very sharp and beautiful, and the native women in the film, just as beautiful, native, scintillating, and sexy. Even the nudity of the women was in good taste.
Hopkins delivers an Oscar winning perfomance as Captain William Bligh, as does Mel Gibson in his role as First mate Fletcher Christian. Both actors from Wales and Austrailia portray the characters as human beings with very human faults. There is no villian or hero in this version. It boils down to faults on both sides. Both Bligh and Christian. Liam Neeson gives an excellent portrayal of Charles Churchill, a very scrappy seaman with an explosive force of nature. And Daniel Day Lewis gives a very hateful and sneaky performance as the ill fated John Friar. A character who gets the fate that he deserves in the end.
From an historical point of view, the film was right on the mark. That also includes the sets, costume designs, and other factual parts of the film. Most of all Vangelis's musical score for the film is just as beautiful as his score was for Chariots Of Fire and Blade Runner.

This version is closest to the interpretation of what happened there that most historians favor today. Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) is neither hero nor villain--merely a sea captain faced with the task of taking his ship on a two-year journey to the other side of the world--a journey that would roughly compare today with a space voyage to Mars. Bligh was picked to captain this voyage for the very good reason that he was reckoned at that time to be the best navigator in the British Navy. (Bligh had been Navigator for the great Captain Cook on that earlier voyage to the South Seas).
This is an incredible story, done twice before of course. This version is far and away my favorite. There are no stereotype heros or villains in this telling. Gibson is simply wonderful as Fletcher Christian, Hopkins as Bligh rings true. The rest of the cast is similarly excellent.
As superb as the movie was, the best part of the movie is the outstanding theme music by Vangelis. The music is beautiful, haunting, and not to be forgotten. This is an example of how the musical score to a movie can really contribute to the overall experience.

677480,4,630347151X,"This is the third major cinematic retelling of the story of the Bounty.  The standard is still the 1935 version with Charles Laughton and Clark Gable, of course, but this most recent version has the advantage of color, and plenty of beautiful, topless Tahitian women.
Speaking of which, this retelling places the major responsibility for the mutiny on the beautiful, topless Tahitian women.  Hopkins portrays Captain Bligh as hard-nosed, but not cruel, and his disciplinary actions are depicted as well within the bounds of what was acceptable in those days.  No keel hauling, no letting people die of thirst, no banishing people to the rigging during storms, etc.  The problem is that Fletcher Christian has fallen in love with a Tahitian princess, who becomes pregnant with his child, and he is heartbroken about leaving her.  Bligh is totally insensitive to his friend's predicament, and chooses that moment to start running a tight ship.  Even so, Christian is conflicted about the mutiny.  He seems to know he is doing the wrong thing, but can't help himself.
This may be a more balanced (and perhaps more historically accurate, I don't know) portrayal of the story, but it leaves you with no one to root for and no one to identify with.  You feel bad for both men.  You feel sorry for Christian, because it must have been gut-wrenching for him to have to leave his young Tahitian wife, but you can't really approve of the mutiny, either.  On the other hand, you do not like Bligh, who is an insensitive, arrogant prick, but he has done nothing that even comes close to justifying taking the ship away from him.
On a technical note, the picture looks great, and the sound is unusually good for DVD.  On the negative side, there are no extras whatsoever.  I am chagrined to learn, from a previous reviewer, that there were two commentary tracks on the British version.

677481,3,630347151X,"Roger Donaldson's beautiful film of the revolt on the H.M.S. Bounty was originally intended as a two-part feature for director David Lean.  Although Robert Bolt's original screenplay has been masterfully compressed from it's lavish and detailed original six hour length, the core ideas Lean and Bolt were attracted to remain intact.
The conflict in this superior version of the classic tale is not so much between Christian and Bligh as it is between savagery and civilization.
No computer-generated images can yet compete with the recreation of a full-scale Bounty.  To see it gracefully slicing the open seas of the South Pacific is a delight.  A surprisingly youthful Mel Gibson is a very contemporary Mister Christian up against a disturbed but human Captain Bligh as characterized by a minimalist (and then alcoholic) Anthony Hopkins.
Director Donaldson (""Smash Palace"") gets into a rhythm of tension and release that keeps this stunning-looking movie fully alive. The electronic score by Vangelis (""Chariots of Fire"") was much criticized at the time of this movie's original release but now seems more fitting and less jarring.

677482,5,630347151X,"Deftly directed by Roger Donaldson and beautifully acted, this is a well nuanced film. Based upon a true story and adapted from the book, ""Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian"", by Richard Hough, the film relates the series of events that brought about the eventual mutiny of the English vessel, The Bounty, by its crew. The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian, the Master's Mate, and  friend of Lt. William Bligh, Captain of the ship. The film opens with the trial of Captain Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) before the Admiralty Board, where he is questioned by Captain Greetham (Edward Fox) and Admiral Hood (Laurence Olivier). Captain Bligh then relates his account of why it was that he lost a ship under his command.

The star-crossed voyage of ""The Bounty"" started innocuously enough. Captain William Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) convinced his friend, Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson), to set sail with him as Master's Mate to Ship Master John Fryer (Daniel Day Lewis). ""The Bounty"" was commissioned to set sail for Tahiti in order to obtain breadfruit plants for transport to Jamaica. In order to save time, the Captain would navigate a little used route around the horn of Africa to save time. It was to be a voyage to remember.

During the voyage, the viewer sees the tension build amongst the crew, as well as amongst the officers. The innate savagery and baseness of some of the seamen is personified by Charles Churchill (Liam Neeson), a seaman who needs little provocation. The disdain of the officers for the crew is best exemplified by John Fryer, the ship's Master, who seems to relish the cruelty of the punishments meted out to those crewmen found guilty of infractions. Tension then spills over between the crew and officers, as the rigors of the voyage eats away at morale. By the time the ship reaches Tahiti, the die is cast. Months on the lovely island creates a false reality and an indolence that sets the stage for what is to come. Fletcher's  erotic romance with a Tahitian princess further erodes discipline and strains the friendship between Bligh and Christian. By the time they finally shove off and set sail back to England with the breadfruit plants that they had sought, the end is near.

Mel Gibson does a superb job with the role of Fletcher Christian. The viewer first sees him as an ambitious, yet kindly young man, who, having weathered the rigors and cruelties of the voyage, finds romance and peace on the idyllic island of Tahiti. Setting sail to return home and once again encountering the rigors and reality of a sea voyage, Christian seems to be a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown. With morale low among the crew, he makes a life defining decision. The rest is history.

Anthony Hopkins is simply brilliant in the role of William Bligh. Playing him as a hard working, by the book captain, he creates a three dimensional character that is sympathetic. Betrayed by friendship and beset by the fates, Bligh manages to pull together and save those men who were cast adrift in a dinghy with him. Masterful and mindful of his professional obligations, he makes an astounding voyage, believable because of the qualities of character infused in him by Hopkins' portrayal. The viewer senses, however, that he will forever be at a loss to comprehend Christian's actions.

This is a visually beautiful film, with stunningly lush island scenes. There is an original musical score by Vangelis that is wonderfully atmospheric. The performances by the cast are superlative. What more could a film lover ask for? Bravo!",1023235200,68,3537,4.865448504983389

Great acting as ever from Sir Anthony and a very fine Performance if slightly dodgy English accent from Mr Gibson.  Other notable appearances are Liam Neeson, Daniel Day Lewis and then a little known Neil Morrisey as Quintel.
I can thoroughly recommend this film as a captivating piece of cinema, and one which I regularly watch.  Dispite what other people have said, I think the Vangelis sountrack helps lift the film above the norm, one particularly striking scene is punctauted with a thunder like clap of sound when Bligh reduces Fryer in Rank in front of the crew - you can smell the tension!!!
A thoroughly underated and undeservedly ignored film, which I believe deserves the badge of 'Cult Classic'.",1016841600,2,1055,4.904494382022472
677484,3,630347151X,"I viewed this movie before reading the book on which it was based: ""Capt. Bligh and Mr. Christian"" by Richard Hough. There were several distortions which I found annoying: (1) The cause of the mutiny was not Bligh's intention to return via Cape Horn. Bligh never intended to return via Cape Horn -- they left Tahiti in April - autumn in the southern hemisphere - and would not have tried the Horn in winter. The cause was Bligh's continual nagging of Christian after Tahiti and Midshipman Ned Young's egging Christian on to take the ship. (2) When he returned to Tahiti after the mutiny Christian told the king that Bligh had sailed off with Capt. Cook, not that he had taken the ship. (Bligh had never told the Tahitians that Cook had been murdered in Hawaii ten years before - no doubt so as not to give them ideas). (3) Hough's book makes an excellent case that there was a homosexual relationship between Bligh and Christian before Tahiti and that Bligh was enraged when Christian took up with the king's daughter while there. This was hinted at in the movie in the meeting between Bligh and Christian just before the mutiny when Christian calls Bligh ""William"", and also in Christian's final speech to Bligh before he orders him into the long boat.
The second point above may be fairly trivial and the third may have been impossible to deal with in 1974, but the real cause of the mutiny should have been told correctly.
I would have given this 5 stars except for the distortions.  I thought both Gibson and Hopkins were magnificent, fully fleshed out characters, unlike Laughton, Gable, Howard and Brando  before them.",1016582400,2,1624,4.6947368421052635
677545,5,630347151X,"Everybody knows already the story of The Bounty and how it ends. The battle of wills between Captain Bligh (excellent Anthony Hopkins) and Fletcher Christian (equally excellent Mel Gibson). What prompted me to write a review is another review, one from Mr. Stefan Schott from Germany (December 29, 2000), who gave the DVD one star! He said that the dialogues were so distorted that it is impossible to watch the movie and that image quality is below average.
First, maybe the quality of the copy in Europe (Region 2) is different from the one that sells for Region 1.
I bought the DVD yesterday and watched it last night. This is a prime example of low price/high quality DVD. The widescreen is a perfect media to set off the visual quality of that movie.  The sunsets are marvelous, the close-ups are stunning and the scenes filmed at the water's edge leave us breathless. As for the audio quality, I did not find any flaws.  The sound is perfectly clear and the dialogues are all audible.
Obviously, Mr. Schott had a much different experience than I did with the DVD version of ""The Bounty"".  I just wanted to bring that to the attention of potential American buyers so that they will not be put off by Mr. Schott's review.
The only let down of this DVD is that there are no extras.  At that price though, the fact that the movie itself on DVD is exceptional is worth the price.",1011225600,8,1380,4.530120481927711

677547,5,630347151X,"Although this is not a new story on film, it is an excellent reworking of it. Mel Gibson and (pre-Hannibal) Anthony Hopkins are excellent as Fletcher Christian and William Bligh. This version adds backstory: Bligh and Christian were friends before their tragic journey that would leave one on trial and one marooned. The story is told via flashbacks by Bligh in front of a court-martial headed by the legendary Lawrence Olivier. This is not your typical production of the Bounty story, this beginning proves it. Next we are shown something of Bligh: he is an aging, ambitious Navy man who wants to advance with this mission: bring bread fruits from Tahiti to the colony in the West Indies, where a famine is occuring. After accomplishing their mission, some sailors, notably Churchill(Liam Neeson, excellent), decide to stay on the island. Punishing them has detrimental effects for Bligh's popularity. Bligh soon is out of control, and it is time for Christian to stage his mutiny. Beautiful photography is just a part of its brilliance. Modern audiences will love this retelling of a classic tale, and it has a stellar cast, high production values, and has that sense of adventure that is essential.

677548,4,630347151X,"I always liked the Marlon Brando (as Fletcher Christian) and Trevor Howard (as William Bligh) version until I did my own bit of research and found that it was pure Hollywood fiction.  About the only thing Hollywood got right was that the story took place in Tahiti and that breadfruit was involved.
This more obscure version of the story gets it right!  History seems to show that William Bligh was an extremely capable and competent naval officer who was given a very difficult job, with no other commissioned officers for help (Mr. Christian was Masters Mate and Acting Lieutenant) and no Royal Marine guards for protection (they needed the room for all the flower pots).  Bligh himself was only a Lieutenant having previously served as Master under Captain Cook.  Even after the mutiny and being abandoned at sea, he didn't give up and heroically captained his open boat to the nearest settlement 3,000+ miles away on Timor.  Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins do a great job portraying the principles in script which is probably close to what actually happened based on all evidence.
This version at least helps rectify a great historical injustice regarding the command of Mr. Bligh.",998265600,,1184,4.9296482412060305
677549,1,630347151X,"I'm really not a movie critic and I feel there are other people and forums better suited to review a movie than this. This is to discuss the quality of the release for sale at amazon, in this case the DVD. When one writes an online review, the first thing to answer is: How do you rate this DVD? and not: How do you rate this movie!  Well, the DVD unfortunately is a disgrace to the studio MGM. With the monaural VHS tape of ""The Bounty"", they have already proven that they are totally ignorant to audio quality, but the DVD even manages to top this. The dialogues, especially in the latter half of the movie, are so distorted (clipping) that is is impossible to watch this movie with any kind of enjoyment. Although encoded in Dolby Digital, the rear speakers are dead quiet for all but one very brief scene. The same applies for the subwoofer channel, which might as well be out for lunch, even in the scene where the ship gets hammered by giant waves near Cape Horn. To make matters worse, the image quality is also well below average, which is particularly disappointing for an anamorphic transfer such as this. There are compression artefacts throughout and a lack of detail which makes me wonder what transfer MGM actually used to produce this DVD. My guess is they dug up some old letterbox tape from their vaults and gained anamorphic format by way of interpolation. There are no bonus features of any kind, not even English subtitles. To anyone who, like me, loves ""The Bounty"" and the brilliant performances by Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, I recommend not to buy this DVD - you will inevitably end up with a lot of anger and a sour stomach!

677550,5,630347151X,"Please listen to those folks who recommended THE BOUNTY, they are right on the money. This is one of my favorite films and has been for 15 years. Never less than immensely entertaining and beautifully crafted, THE BOUNTY is a powerhouse work-gorgeously photographed,expertly acted (Hopkins,Gibson,Neeson,Day-Lewis,and oh yeah, Olivier),perfectly scored by synth genius Vangelis (don't listen to inane critisicms claiming period films ought only to be scored with 'appropriate' instruments-was the 'Chariots of Fire' score innapropriate?!?),and written sensitively and accurately by screenwriting legend Robert Bolt. I can remember anticipating seeing THE BOUNTY on cable in the mid-80's, having (like most) missed it in theaters. When I finally did, I pretty much became obsessed with it, watching it repeatedly, memorizing whole scenes, and becoming increasingly mesmerized by Vangelis' throbbing,over-heated score(a double c.d. soundtrack I'm proud to say I own since only 2000 were produced). The 80's won't be remembered for many cinematic gems, but THE BOUNTY ought to be mentioned as being one of the few. It's a classy, serious drama(not a melodrama like the other versions), and it really deserves to be re-examined. As does Hopkins performance which is nothing less than brilliant. His Bligh is so textured,his interpretation so authentically prismatic,each mood and expression acted with such devastating skill, it's a crime so few have experienced it.",977702400,,1462,5.741935483870968

Hopkins and Gibson are the only two interesting characters in it, and many great actors are shockingly wasted, especially Olivier and Fox, who are hardly even in it.  The film has a different approach to the story and is not very well told, with Bligh a rather fair person who turns cruel for seemingly no reason, and he doesn't even approach the tyranny that Charles Laughton expressed in his unmatched performance, making the crew's mutiny seem almost totally unjustified.  It also has the look and feel of a TV movie, and though out of interest I would like to see this new DVD in all it's widescreen glory, I am still holding out for a DVD of the definitive 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty.",971654400,4,856,4.503225806451613

I think it should be rated PG-13, however, for it's  topless nudity scenes, done National Geographic style...in other words, not  in bad taste. It adds to the realism, if you ask me.
I just can't  understand why amazon.com will not make available the HiFi version of  ""The Bounty"" on VHS and it just floors me that of all the  ""junk"" out on DVD, that a title such as this with it's awesome  cast isn't yet available on DVD!

677553,4,630347151X,"Dang, don't you just HATE it when your crew turns on you?
That's the problem that Captain Bligh faces in this gritty, realistic story of the mutiny on the Bounty. Mel Gibson plays Anthony Hopkins' first mate, who  rebels and brings a lot of his buddies with him when they reach Tahiti, but  are charmed by the native girls, climate, and the simple beauty of it all.  Unfortunately, when Bligh refuses to budge or sway, the men mutiny.
A  warning: This story is not for the kiddies. It may be PG, but there is a  great deal of casual toplessness amongst the native gals, an  all-naughty-parts-hidden swim, and a fall-over visual of Gibson and his  pregnant girlfriend. Aside from the sexiness of it, there is also a  disturbing section where some former deserters are whipped.
That said,  Hopkins does a fantastic job creating a man who you want to slap for being  so rigid, and sympathize with because of the pain in his eyes while he is  being grilled. Gibson, usually more emotive, seems a bit uncomfortable and  stiff. My personal fave, Liam Neeson, plays a rebellious jerk who remains  behind on the island, and Neesonites will cringe in pain at the look on his  face as he is whipped.
So watch the movie, but be ready to cover small  eyes.",964051200,5,1244,4.5656108597285066
