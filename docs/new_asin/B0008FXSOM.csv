8056074,3,B0008FXSOM,What more can I say?  This is the sort of DVD that you can leave running while entertaining etc.  It'd be great in a motorcycle retail shop etc.  Fun plus.,1339718400,,155,4.1
8056075,2,B0008FXSOM,"I was disappointed in this DVD. It may look new and be a DVD, but it is quite old, and the commentator is boring, almost unprofessional. There is very little variety in the crashes and it only runs for one hour. Definitely not worth the same money as other DVD's with much more material. With how old this recording is, it should sell for $5 at the most.",1121817600,,354,4.220588235294118
