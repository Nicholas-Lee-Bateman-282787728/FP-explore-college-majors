8293860,2,B001DJ698E,"This is a low budget ""comedy"" about local news stations and wanna-bees trying to scoop each other on the story of some strange killings that seem to be connected to the cows. Judging from the actors and dialouge, I supposed this was to be a comedy, although I never laughed at their amateur attempt at humor, including the two ranch hands who copied ""Bill and Ted."" The lone ""special effect"" is someone shaking the camera while shooting.

The comedy aspect of the killer cow was never exploited to its fullest. The movie does have some cute blonds but not enough to carry the film. They use a terrible font where ""M"", ""N"" and ""H"" all look the same on the screen. The movie is far from ""hilarious"" as falsely described on the box. If you see writer/director/actor Chris Palko, tell him he owes me $2.00.

No sex, no nudity, no bad language, no acting, no blood, no gore.",1317168000,,869,4.493670886075949
8293861,5,B001DJ698E,"Based on previous feedback, there seems to be some misunderstanding about this feature presentation. This is a video-movie. It is not a professionally made film. If this dulls your interest stop here. If you like movies that are off the Hollywood radar, or ones that don't classify well in today's mainstream ""independent"" film markets, then take the time to see what The Coterie Of Empirical Efforts has done with this micro-budget movie.

Regardless of how one may judge the production value, all filmmaking is anything if not putting out a series of fires (or creating them). A filmmaker with little to no resources has to rely on what's at hand in order to deliver a story that's both comprehendible, and at least mildly entertaining.

And you're right to think you're not under any obligation to like it, especially just for that. But the accessibility of digital video, along with the Internet, has created a new genre of filmmaking that does not contain the polished post-production that ""glitzes"" its way into our theatres and video stores daily. Not that there is anything wrong with any of those, rather the lack of a highly polished product is simply another way to tell a visual story - as it always has been since cinema's beginning.

As with any film genre, part of the experience in watching is keeping in mind not only the limitations (intended or otherwise) of that genre, but also the opportunities that it provides to tell a story. It is with this acceptance that we choose one DVD to another from day to day.

When standard expectations of movie viewing are opened to at least include the non-professionally made movie, a whole other world of unique viewing pleasure can begin. So sit back, relax, take it easy, and take it for what it is. The 97 minutes (well-paced, and chocked full of laughs btw) will be worth the time.",1228953600,,1843,4.768025078369906
