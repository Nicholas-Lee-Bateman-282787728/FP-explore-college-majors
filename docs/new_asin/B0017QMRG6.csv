8266907,5,B0017QMRG6,"Great hand weight routine. I have three other Joel Harper DVDs and use all of them for exercise variety. I really like how he keeps things going and mixes stretches in with exercises. I am puzzled by why he has the mix of exercises that he does in each video and find that I need to rotate between videos to avoid different parts of my body getting stiff and developing issues. I've also found that Peggy Cappy Yoga videos are a great complement to Joel Harper videos as I get older. Joel harper videos exercise many parts of body really well but don't seem to do anything for forward bends, hamstring stretches, relaxation, and several other things covered in Peggy Cappy videos.  At 68 years old, I find that unless I do different kinds of exercises routinely that various kinds of issues develop.",1411430400,3,799,4.5874125874125875

8266909,5,B0017QMRG6,"This is another one of Joel's workouts, and as usual, they're JUST GREAT!
Joel always has something new to show you and I love them because they're
short and get the job done, plus you don't need any equipment to do them.
I have almost all of Joel's workouts and rotate them so I get something
different each time. I highly recommend them!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-The-Owner-s-Manual-Workout/dp/B0017QMRG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You: The Owner's Manual Workout</a>",1308009600,,517,6.4

8266913,4,B0017QMRG6,"i'm a fan of joel's and the ""you"" series.  the other titles have all used your own body weight. this adds low weight/hi reps.  it pretty basic stuff but you never stop moving, so you definately will build a sweat.  it also has a cardio portion, around 30min.  mixed impact, some old school moves....but they work. as always, joel is very encouraging and he know his stuff!",1216252800,17,372,4.507462686567164
