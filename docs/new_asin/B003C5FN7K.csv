4107627,5,B003C5FN7K,"This is a great concert on DVD. I went to the Michael Bolton concert in Tunica, MS in 2010 and I really had a great experience. I bought this video assumning it would be another disappointment as far as the DVD living up to the live performance experience. I was wrong. This is a great DVD. Great selection of songs....... great audio and video quality.... I highly recommend purchasing this DVD.",1298505600,2,396,4.591549295774648
4107628,5,B003C5FN7K,"In an era when ""artists"" spend a lot on decors, special effects, costumes, dancers etc, it is refreshing to see a performer surrounded only by a bunch of good musicians pouring they souls into their music and enjoying the performance. This was my first impression after I've received the DVD yesterday. It was touching to watch Michael Bolton's concentration while performing. Not a jukebox into which you insert a coin. A great show of respect for his audiance. Lovely concert, lovely atmosphere.",1294790400,,497,5.073170731707317
4107629,5,B003C5FN7K,"Excellent performance!!!!! if you want to enjoy a very good show, you should buy this one. Great 5.1 and DTS sound!!!!!! Excellent image quality using an 32' LCD with a standard dvd player(not hdmi).",1291507200,4,199,4.882352941176471
4107630,4,B003C5FN7K,I had seen Michael Bolton on a Palladia segment recently and realized that I needed to see more of him. I ordered this for myself but allowed my fiance to give it to me for my birthday. I had a hard time waiting two weeks to watch it. I spent the first part of my day blasting it throught the surround sound speakers and Im sure the whole neighborhood heard him as well. A great way to spend almost three hours.,1289520000,6,411,4.08641975308642
4107631,5,B003C5FN7K,"The acoustics at the Royal Albert Hall is fantastic and the audio on this Blu Ray does not disappoint.  The choice of Dolby 5.1 or HD DTS brings to you the full theater experience, with Michael Bolton and his band rendering a sterling performance.

Although the video is 1080i, it's definitely one of the crispest Blu Ray concerts that I have seen!  The video is certainly  rendered close to 1080p quality - there is  virtually no noise (sparkles).

As an added bonus, this Blu Ray comes with an 8 page color booklet/sleeve notes filled with generous photos of the concert and a ""centerfold"" of the full band.

This Blu Ray is now my number one choice for showing off my home theater!

Yet another great concert at the Royal Albert Hall.  Well done Michael Bolton!  5 Stars!",1283644800,6,808,4.580419580419581
4107632,5,B003C5FN7K,"Ever looked forward to seeing a concert so much you were really ""let down"" and disappointed when you bought it? NOT this one. This Michael Bolton concert shows the quality of the singer, the musicians and the audio and video crew. It is what every great concert should be...entertaining, enjoyable and definately not disappointing.",1281225600,17,331,5.148148148148148
4107633,5,B003C5FN7K,"I'll be honest with you. I love his music. I do. I'm a Michael Bolton fan.

For my money, I don't know if it gets any better than when he sings 'When a Man Loves a Woman'.",1274572800,21,171,3.6216216216216215
4107634,2,B003C5FN7K,"This concert sounds good in stereo and looks good, too. Unfortunately, all DVD functions do not work. I tried many times to get this to work as far as any function like selecting dts,etc. It would only play in stereo, which is a shame. It did sound fairly good in stereo, but that was not what i bought this for. I have a 8.1 home theater system and I had hoped for more than just stereo. The player that would only play in stereo is a brand new Oppo BDP-SE top of the line SACD/Bluray player. It has done well with all other discs, but this one. My other player is a lap top entertainment pc HP dv7. It refused to play it at all, saying I needed to put a disc in. I do like a lot of Michael Bolton's songs and have many concerts from Royal Albert Hall, so was looking forward to this one.",1274486400,,789,4.031847133757962
4107635,5,B003C5FN7K,"The vocals are excellent and also his large band as well.  The High Definition video and Dolby 5.1 sound is about as good as it gets.  Many cameras were used to thoroughly capture this great concert.
A very good mix of some 'Vintage' songs, old 'Classics' and his popular cuts.  This is probably Michael captured at his BEST.",1274400000,,325,4.568965517241379
4107636,5,B003C5FN7K,"This is by far Michael Bolton's best DVD concert to date.  Eagle Eye HD inc. has gotten the closest to capturing the actual concert experience.  With the HD picture and sound quality that was recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound it will really connect with your home theatre system.  These are some of the clearest vocal performances he's ever laid down and the venue is georgeous.  Show stoppers include new song One Love, When a man loves a Woman, Hope It's too late, Nessun Dorma, Thats Life and and incredible vulnerable and powerfully depicted cover of Van morrision's Crazy Love-- in my opinion this is the definitive version now!  You will not be dissapointed with over two hours of content and in depth interview and of course Michael Bolton at his best!",1273104000,16,770,4.7593984962406015

4107670,5,B003C5FN7K,"What can I say about Michael Bolton's talent and gorgeous voice?  His talents are so versatile, he can sing anything with great passion, the emotion he brings to every performance wraps around you and pulls you into the music and lyrics.  I love Michael's classical style, would love to have a full CD of mew operatic/classical music without the applause and cheers, which he so deserves!  The musical choices on this album are excellent for his amazing vocal range.  Listen once,  you will be forever hooked as a fan of Michael's beautiful voice and AMAZING vocal ability!  Michael has been in the league of Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett for decades, and has continued to move forward to become a master of many musical styles.  What a voice!  This CD of Michael's will lift your spirits and fill you up with love and amazement.
