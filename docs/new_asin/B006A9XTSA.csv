4981413,4,B006A9XTSA,"""Revenge is a vicious circle, once you start you can't stop.""  After Antonio's (Zaror) parents are killed when he was young he turns into a ruthless bounty hunter named Mandrill.  He is obsessed with finding his parent's killer and when he finally does he also meets Dominique, who could be his downfall. Going in I was expecting to see a Latino James Bond type movie.  What I got was a Latino James Bond type movie that is also a 70's Kung-Fu type thing. The fighting was a little cheesy and the music and editing were very much like a 70's TV show. All that said, I was very entertained throughout the entire movie and I recommend this. The ending is great and the last scene leaves you wondering...which is rare for this type of movie. Overall, much better then anticipated and worth a watch. I give it a B.",1330214400,,810,4.422818791946309

8495700,5,B006A9XTSA,Marko Zaror is the best martial artist in the world and this is a James Bond spoof but with great fights and a good story I recommend Mirageman too Zaror deserves to be at the top when it comes to action stars and deserves a big budget film,1435190400,,240,4.020833333333333
8495701,4,B006A9XTSA,Enjoyed this film at Action fest Film Festival. Marko Zaror is in Machete 2 and did a great job starring in Mandrill. Great action and martial arts skills. And I understand that NO wires for stunts were used.,1381449600,,208,4.5
8495702,3,B006A9XTSA,"Upon this film's North American release, my like for the fantastic Marko Zaror - the only performer currently putting South America on the map of the martial arts market - was overcome by my wariness of spoofs and parodies, as this was said to be a take on 1970s spy fare. Thus, I let this one slip my mind for the better part of the year before finally committing myself to watching it. I truly believe it'll be a long while before Zaror manages to top his excellent performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>, and with this mindset, disappointment doesn't come as easily, regardless of the film's other flaws. And while these flaws are indeed there and take their toll on my rating, I was surprised by how much of the film actually works. Its strengths aren't evident on the DVD cover, but they're apparent enough to enjoy for anyone who picks up the movie.

The story: an international assassin (Zaror) tracks down the crime lord who murdered his parents (Juan Aliaga) but in the process falls in love with his daughter (Chilean TV star Celine Reymond).

For starters, let me clarify that this is not an action-comedy, but rather an action film with comedic parts, mostly in the form of flashbacks and references to the hero's obsession with a fictional James Bond knockoff. The production emulates a '70s style, but this isn't done to the extremes of something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dynamite/dp/B002BWP3W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dynamite</a>. Cumulatively, the whole '70s aspect could have been done away with without damaging the film, and just exists to give the movie some flavor. Not that it'd be tasteless without it, of course, since the story and script are both surprisingly strong. The plot is an examination of the cycle of revenge, going on where other films conveniently end and showing - however dramatically and unrealistically - that violence doesn't end just because you've killed your version of the bad guy. The acting of Zaror and Celine Reymond stands out in the end, as they prove themselves capable of both lifelike emotion and comic book beef. A remarkably tense standoff in the second half of the film impressed me to no end, and the ending is a breath of fresh air for an action flick...for the most part. Did they really need that twist at the very end?

For those of you unfamiliar with ol' Marko, be aware that he's without a doubt one of the better screen martial artists of our time. Complementing his sound forms are pleasing acrobatics that are all the more impressive for the 6'3"" frame of the man performing them. This here's a good enough vehicle for him to showcase his physical skills, but yet, it's not the martial arts movie of the year. Six fights demonstrate a surprising variety of choreography, from the flipping and spinning we expect to a couple of grounded technical exchanges and even a bit of MMA-style stuff. I particularly like that several fights demonstrate that Zaror's character is not invincible: the lack one-sidedness, even against opponents who look less impressive than him, is a nice switch from the action norm. However, none of the fights are what I'd call genuinely dynamic, part of which has to do how they're shot: it's not the maddeningly claustrophobic filming style that I usually complain about, but too large a portion of the fights are filled from the back, therein hiding the strikes of the fighters. Additionally - and I can't believe I'm writing this - but Marko's signature acrobatics look more than a bit out-of-place in this film, especially when the fight is taking place in a cramped corridor. I'm glad the filmmakers did their best to maximize their resources, but moderation would have definitely been more harmonious in this case.

I haven't seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirageman/dp/B002I41KNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirageman</a>, but ""Mandrill"" here is definitely a superior overall vehicle to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiltro/dp/B00127RAK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiltro</a>. Zaror fans oughtn't be without it, and it's good enough for passive action fans to expect a reasonably fun time. I'm pleased to see Marko trying out different kinds of styles, but I think he has yet to find the one that truly works for him.",1349395200,,4532,5.47925608011445
8495703,3,B006A9XTSA,"I first ran across this movie a couple of years ago when I randomly found the trailer online.  I thought it looked very cool with a lot of nice action.  I didn't think much of it after that, never really went out of my way to find it or anything.  Then recently, it randomly popped up on Netflix and I remembered the trailer.  I gave it a shot.

There are some positives and some negatives to the flick.  I would say that the majority of the negatives are due to budgetary constraints, as this is obviously a low budget flick.  The locations don't always feel real, there's not a lot of extras walking around scenes you would think to be crowded.  A scene taking place in a bar looks like the least populated bar you'd ever run across.  These are things that don't necessarily make the movie a bad movie, but you just kind of notice on a peripheral level.

What I did like was the lead, Marko Zaror, who shows a bit of charm and a lot of action chops.  There are some action moves that I questioned if he could actually do or was assisted in some way.  Either way, the guy is a skilled martial artist and had plenty of opportunity to show off.  The movie has its share of ""running through the hallways, chasing or being chased by guys with guns"" moments, but when he could let loose with his moves, the movie worked wonderfully.

The tone of the movie is another thing I really enjoyed, though I do think sometimes it didn't know if it was trying to be a revenge thriller or a take off of Bond/Blaxploitation type of genre movie.  It can be a bit uneven that way, but I still think it works.  Mandrill takes his lead from a Bond like in universe movie series ""John Colt"", which explains his cheesy approach to women that still somehow seems to work.

Until he meets one girl.  On a mission that will finally put him face to face with the assassin that killed his parents, Mandrill has to get himself romantically involved with the man's daughter.  And she doesn't fall for the obviously shallow cheap one liners he attempts to use to seduce her.  The weird thing is, when he ""gets real"" with her and drops the act, the cheese in his lines doesn't go away and she eats it up.

So yeah, I think the flick works as a nice little Bond homage with some 70s Kung Fu funk going on, but the movie does try to dig a little deeper.  It has Mandrill wrestling with themes of revenge and if the ultimate cost is worth the nightmares going away.  There are consequences in actions taken that drive the movie to a twist that you may or may not see coming.  It was a nice departure to show that the decisions Mandrill makes might make things worse for him in the overall scheme of things.

It's a fun flick that moves at a good pace.  If you don't mind the obvious low budget setting, you can sit back and enjoy where the money really went.  On some nice action set pieces with some good performances from the two leads.",1340236800,,2905,4.272893772893773
8495704,4,B006A9XTSA,"I loved this movie. In many ways, this movie is as much a loving Bond spoof as the French OSS 117 films with Jean Dujardin...though not nearly as broadly comical. Everything about the film is brilliantly on-target, from the staging to the John Barry/David Arnold-esque music. The movie is structurally an homage to DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (stealing the teaser almost beat-for-beat) and yet surprisingly original, too. As a child, Mandrill sees his parents killed and grows up seeking revenge against their murderer. The clever twist here is that Mandrill intentionally models himself on ""John Colt,"" a cheesy 70s Bond/Shaft/Flint character. So you get a spoof within an homage. Cheeky. If you are fan of Bond films, Blaxploitation, and Eurospy movies, this is a must-see. Now I have to find the soundtrack!",1337990400,2,803,5.137404580152672
8495705,4,B006A9XTSA,Mr. Mandrill has moves the likes of which I have never seen! The movie is spanish subtitled and has a James Bondish way about it that keeps the movie light. The physical ability of the star is extraordinary. Loved it.,1336608000,,217,4.45
8495706,4,B006A9XTSA,"I really enjoyed this Chilean revenge action film. The hero is on a mission to avenge his parents death but a woman makes his revenge a pyric victory. Filled with campy goodness including a series of fake 70's spy films starring a fictional ""John Colt"" who the hero modelled hmself after this film has tounge firmly in cheek but also delivers on good gun battles and mma style fight sequences. The lead female is smoking hot, the heroes uncle is a great mentor who has great advice for seducing women and best of all  Mandrill  is an old school bada**. Watch Mandrill you won't be disappointed.",1333843200,2,594,4.59433962264151
8495707,3,B006A9XTSA,"It would seem after watching MANDRILL that the folks in South America are in love with the whole James Bond mystique. At least the folks who made this movie are. Everything from how Bond captures the attention of women to the tux to the actual image of the poster for FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is on display here. In some places it works, in others it seems played as much for camp/comedy as anything else.

Chilean born star Marko Zaror stars as Antonio Epsinoza aka Mandrill. The movie opens with Mandrill killing his mark and being well paid for his assassin skills. During the payoff he is given the option for another job, one that will lead him to the man he's sought for years, a man known as Cyclops.

Flashbacks lead us to how and why Antonio became a killer. As a child he witnessed the murder of his father and mother at the hands of a ruthless killer. Before being killed his mother was able to wound the killer and taking out one of his eyes, thus the Cyclops name later on. As Antonio grows up, he is raised by his uncle and learns what type of man his father was. It seems his father based his life on a film character who was the quintessential ladies man and spy. We never learned who he worked for but the uncle does help Antonio with his one weak area: women. How to be suave and debonair and always get the lady into bed is taught in one lesson. How this uncle who seems more sleazy looking than inspiring is part of the camp.

Back to the present and Mandrill heads to the home of a killer for hire who knows where to find Cyclops daughter, the weak link in his armor. A hand to hand martial arts battle takes place and eventually the two sit to talk. Before he has the chance to kill him Mandrill takes out the hit man.

We move on to a casino as Mandrill checks in. Working his way into a high stakes poker game, he meets the Cyclops's daughter and tries to woo her, failing in the attempt. When he meets her again as she sings karaoke, a tune that he recognizes as the one played on a locket his mother owned that was taken by Cyclops, he begins to fall for the woman. When he gets up and disco dances to the next song, she falls for him. Like I said, this film has all sorts of campy incidents throughout.

The pair end up in bed and afterwards Mandrill is captured by Cyclops and his men. Sitting at a table facing one another, a gun nearby, Mandrill is taunted by Cyclops to shot him while his daughter watches. As the men go for their guns, Mandrill kills Cyclops fulfilling the oath he made to do so when his parents were killed. The love birds part ways as enemies and the rest of the movie is filled with the daughter's attempts to kill Mandrill.

Yes as always there is something lost in the translation. The acting appears to be solid and the martial arts fight sequences are nicely done as they have been in other Zaror films I've seen. The funniest parts are the movies within the movie of the spy character he emulates, some of the cheesiest looking sequences ever put on film on purpose.

The film rarely gets boring and it's all played for laughs. No not gut busting laughs but laughs with a nod and a wink. As I said at the beginning, the film makers here absolutely love Bond and it shows. But make no mistake; this film doesn't live up to those classics. It does offer a decent amount of entertainment though and it's interesting to see how other countries treat the source material.",1332201600,,3417,4.280185758513932
8495708,2,B006A9XTSA,"This film is so bad I thought it was a spoof of 70's action films complete with wack-a-da wack-a-da music and disco. Marko Zaror plays hit man Mandrill and is given a voice that sounds like Jason Statham. His parents were killed by a hit man named ""Cyclops"" who lost an eye during the incident. He has become Mandrill's target. Earlier we saw Mandrill looking for a guy named Waldo, asking everyone ""Where's Waldo."" You can't help but laugh. There are flashbacks to his youth and his TV idol, John Colt, an oriental action hero who is also unintentionally comical.

In order to get to ""The Cyclops"" Mandrill must get the information from his daughter who he woos.

Terrible acting and dubbing.

No f-bombs, brief sex? no nudity (arms in way). This film might be better to watch as an MST project.",1331337600,,796,4.591549295774648
