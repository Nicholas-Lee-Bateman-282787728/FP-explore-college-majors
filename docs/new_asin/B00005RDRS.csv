1654452,4,B00005RDRS,"I have to say this Venoms flick ranks near the top on my favorites list. The story is great, with a band of martial artists tracking down a group of masked killers, with twists and turns and plenty of kung fu action. It only has 3 of the 5 Venoms, but still delivers the goods. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the picture quality was not all that great, it looks like it was dubbed from an old vhs copy, and the sound is garbled in some spots. Regardless I am still happy that I purchased it for I hadn't seen it for quite some time, and would recommed it to all Venoms fans.",1032393600,,593,3.991596638655462
1654453,3,B00005RDRS,"Masked Avengers may be my favourite Shaw Brothers film... certainly it rates highly.  I've bought, copied and stayed up late to tape it more times than bear mention.  Naturally I was thrilled to see it on DVD... in digital format at last!!
But the product is mediocre at best.  It is mastered from a very old video copy with plenty of artifacts, and very clearly not from film.  It's not letterboxed, making much of the dialogue literally one-sided (since you can only see half of the screen), and as with other films released by NS and Ground Zero, there are gaps in the sound. To put it bluntly, there are plenty of better copies out there in private collections.  Even the uncompleted synopsis on the box (""...a stunning climax at the Mask Gang's""--  what?  The Masked Gang's what?!) indicates the level of carelessness that went into this ""Limited Collector's Edition.""
Still, this is likely to be the one and only digital print of a Chang Cheh milestone, and it's no worse than a 3am broadcast of Black Belt Theatre.  Unfortunately, it's no better.  Admittedly it's nice to see these old workhorses finally being immortalised and made available for sale.  It would be nicer, however, if it could be done professionally, and with a bit of the affection that makes diehard fans buy them",1012262400,19,1289,4.739910313901345
1654454,4,B00005RDRS,"Most of the popular Venoms appear here in a convoluted story of a masked gang of trident-wielding villians.  No Lo Meng (Toad) or Sun Chien (Scorpion) here --- my favorites.  With a large cast of Venom and Venom-like characters, most of the movie fits into place.  However, very little hand-to-hand fighting is to be seen --- the weapon of choice, obviously, here, is the trident, an infrequently seen kung fu weapon.  Boasting undoubtedly some of the best, if not the best, trident fight choreography ever staged, executed by none other than the Venoms, there is little to go wrong here --- if you like the trident.  This is truly a trident lovers feast fest.  Personally, I'm not that big on the trident, so I didn't appreciate the movie as much as some others might.  Add to that, my favorite Venoms are not in the movie.  Therefore I just can't give the movie my highest rating.  But its still a solid Venom flick.",991008000,6,918,4.617283950617284
1654455,5,B00005RDRS,"This is a must for Venom fans everywhere. There is a gang that uses tridents, in a booby trapped hideout. This one is a little on the gory side, but the fighting is second to none. Great fight scenes and great technique.",977184000,,220,4.261904761904762

1654458,5,B00005RDRS,The Chi saw gang was very well put together.  Golden Arms skills is unmatched.  If General Hi To did not have his wine I think that duel would of lasted forever.  On second thought this might not be  totally true.  The more Hi To drinks the better he fight.  So after a while he would be exhausted and Golden Arm would prevail.  You don't see Golden Arms even remotely close to be winded during a fight.  Overall  I will give it 5 stars.  Collectors classic,1402617600,,457,4.270588235294118
1654459,5,B00005RDRS,I like a karate movie when the fighters get busy.  In this movie the fighters get busy and there is a little suspense.,1396137600,,118,4.130434782608695
1654460,3,B00005RDRS,The movie itself is great...classic old school kung fu and one of my favorites...my problem is with was the audio...the audio kept switching back and forth between english and chinese (with subtitles).,1390003200,,201,5.3125

1654463,5,B00005RDRS,"This is most probably one of the best Shaw Brothers movie ever made with some of the finest armed combat sequences you will ever find. However, there is a problem with the dubbing process as the dialogue keeps switching back and forth from English to Mandarin in the beginning, this being coupled with high distortion by the way of hiss during the dubbed segments, a problem that persist even though I exchanged the copy I bought for another . If you're willing to live with the slight annoyance, then by all means add this movie to your kung fu collection.",1372118400,,557,4.58
1654464,1,B00005RDRS,"order was not what thought, the product a VHS transfer, poor and I mean poor quality, the DVD didn't even work, it froze during play, I would never order from this person, I'd warn from ordering from this person cz of the quality of the product, I read the other reviews on this person, and don't believe the reviews coz of the product I received so buyer beware from this person",1362268800,,379,4.352112676056338
1654465,2,B00005RDRS,Movie audio continued to change throughout the movie. Going from English dubbing to it's original recorded track. This made the movie very irritating to watch.,1359072000,2,159,5.4

1654467,3,B00005RDRS,"The title of this movie should really be: Look at my shiny stick! This flick is a murder mystery! Just because the venoms were in it didn't make it any better. There were no spectacular martial arts battles just guys running around in masks stabbing people with shiny sticks! The only good things you could say about this is that: 1)It has plenty of blood, 2)Samples of this movie were used for a rap album called ""The Pillage"" by an artist named Cappadonna of the Wu-Tang Clan.,and 3)There is no love story! Its better to rent before you buy! This movie is just another example of false hope. Just because a certain actor or a group of actors are in a movie doesn't change the fact that the movie will suck regardless!",1242777600,,719,4.454545454545454
1654468,1,B00005RDRS,"I just got a copy of this movie, ""limited collector's edition"" and it is a worse-than-VHS scrunched transfer on a DVD with no label whatsoever.  Very disappointing.  It was not the ""remastered"" version as displayed on this page.  I don't want to get burned again.  Anyone see the Red Sun version or know who's selling a good U.S. version of this?",1237075200,,346,4.622950819672131
1654469,4,B00005RDRS,"Anyone who has clicked on this movie or has read any of the reviews must be familiar with this Chang Cheh classic from the latter-days of the Venoms (1981).  Despite missing Lo Mang & Sun Chien, director Chang makes up for that by combining his core Venoms-Kuo Chui, Chiang Sheng, Lu Feng & Wang Li and supporting Venoms-Yu Tai-Ping (he gets the acid at the end) & Liu Huang-Shih (he gets the arrows)- with Chien Siu-Hou (from ""Fist of Legend"") & Chu Ke; an exciting, acrobatic martial artist who also contributed to the choreography.  Great performances, awesome hard-hitting trident fu, and a dark atmosphere (almost like a horror/kung fu combo).  Amazing climatic end fight here.

Now, just wanted to let everyone know that the version I received recently is a digitally restored & remastered DVD of this Venom classic.  Celestial just released this last year (2007) and Bonzai got their hands on a nice, clean, widescreen print that they enhanced for 16x9 TVs! I never saw it look this good before.  Great picture; so-so sound though.  The audio comes from the NS VHS version.  While the English dub itself is decent, it's incomplete here (there are about three or four times it switches to Mandarin-don't worry, it's accompanied by subtitles), and it's real ""hissy"" for the first 30 minutes, then it's fine.  Bottom line, for a guy who had to rely on a bootleg, pan-and-scan video for 15 years, I'll deal with the so-so audio because the picture on this DVD is, like the Venoms, awesome.",1229904000,3,1492,4.796875
1654470,4,B00005RDRS,"This is one of my Favorite Kung Fu movies. Philip Kwok does an awesome Trident Kung Fu Form of which I have won tournaments doing. Because I took parts of his movies and incorporated into my form its great!. But this movie is bloody. Very bloody and not suitable for younger audiences. Its action packed. Good sword play but very little hand to hand combat as written in another post. What I highly suggest is that you get this movie but the REMASTERED Version. Or you will waist you money. The DVD cover is mostly Red. Check it out its one of their Best.

Based on the hype right here on Amazon, I rushed out to get this SO CALLED collector's item,,,,,,,,,OH PLEASE!!

1654475,4,B00005RDRS,"I have to tell you all, I am just a Venoms Fanatic ! Kuo Chui, now Phil Kwok, is so ""Dirty Harry"" like in many of his roles. He is a quiet, soft spoken hero with a hidden identity. While I would rank Kid with the Golden Arm above Five Deadly Venoms, this one fits in nicely to my collection. The music to start you off makes me feel like we are in a 1970's theatre in Hawaii about to see a great thriller. This one does not dissapoint ! The pagan trident bad guys are pretty scary, which adds a new dimension to the Venoms, its like they have to solve a mystery thriller. The old temple is akin to a haunted house and its many traps at the end of the film make it great ! Why does Won Far(I forget the characters real name from 5. D.V.) always get killed off ? He lives at the end of 2 champions of Death, but gets a nice kill scene at the end of this one. Sound could be better, but characters are still there. For the True Venoms fans, novices might not be able to follow our boys in their regular roles. If I ever met Phil Kwok in person, I would fall to my knee's and put my left fist in the palm of my right hand and exclaim, ""Master, please teach me !""",1039996800,2,1158,3.890295358649789

7952033,4,B00005RDRS,"DVD Review: Concerning the ""Digitally Remastered and Restored"" Bonzai, Panmedia generic version. Yes, it is the IVL version of the movie which means it is in Widescreen which is a good thing. The audio is a bit suspect as it tends to oscillate from Chinese language to English. There are subtitles that go with the Chinese audio but it sticks whenever the English audio manifests and it can be distracting. 4/5 of the movie is in English and the subtitling can be turned off. The transfer quality is very good and watchable. Overall I was very satisfied with the product. Much better than the stupid Ground Zero version.

Movie review: Aside from the 5 Deadly Venoms, this is my favorite Venoms film. Masked Avengers is chalked full of torture devices, traps, blood and guts, some of the best kung fu action around, a good story but with predictable plot twists (let's face it, we all know Lu Feng is going to be the main villian. SHEEESH!), flamboyance and a cartoonish forced copulation scene. It's everything you can hope for in a Chang Cheh movie. Yay!

In conclusion: Some inconsistencies in the product but it is fine. 4 stars for the DVD and 5 for the movie.",1413676800,3,1165,4.650485436893204
