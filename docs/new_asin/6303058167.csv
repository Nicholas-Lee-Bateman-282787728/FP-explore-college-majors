572578,5,6303058167,"National Geographic was given unprecedented access in order to produce their film on the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and they took advantage of it to produce a documentary which does show what life is like for both the detainees and the guards who must serve inside the wire.

While not a 100% accurate portrayal of what goes on in the facility (the very presence of the cameras changes the behavior of the detainees) it is as close as it gets to seeing the inside of Gitmo without actually getting assigned to JTF Guantanamo Bay. Interviews allow the viewer to get a better idea of the issues which surround the controversial facility, including (unfounded) allegations of ""torture,"" the problems involved with releasing detainees, and the legal responsibilities of the U.S. government. Lawyers for detainees, guards, military officers and even released detainees themselves all discuss issues which surround Guantanamo.

If the film has a weakness it is that the statements of former detainees are not more strongly challenged. For instance, the former Taliban ""ambassador"" to Pakistan stated something to the effect that Islamic scholars ""studied and respected"" the U.S. legal system prior to the long detention of detainees at Gitmo. This statement is absolutely absurd... the only legal system they study and respect is Sharia law. They hate everything else. I disliked the fact that this statement was not challenged.

Also, the implication that detainee treatment at Gitmo ""radicalized"" them is equally stupid. Jihadists were bombing our embassies, ships and the WTC (twice!) well before Guantanamo. The lawyers could have used some more scrutiny as well, in their statements that ""they only wish to see due process"" in the case of detainees. Many of these folks are antiwar and antiprison types and have agendas other than judicial.

My take? Could have been a bit better. But it could have been a LOT WORSE. Anyone who questions the mass media's template of Guantanamo Bay does so at their own risk. Just look at what happened to Miss Universe.",1238889600,4,2062,5.127976190476191

572799,1,6303058167,"I figured a National Geographic documentary would at least attempt to be bipartisan, but this is a very political commentary, and neglects to show how many of the detainees committed terrorist acts against the U.S.",1329868800,,214,5.142857142857143
572800,2,6303058167,"I have an interest in both Cuba and the Middle East, and thought this documentary would be interesting.  Like some of the other reviewers, I was extremely disappointed.  Too much sympathy is given to the detainees, and their plight of being unfairly imprisoned.  National Geographic has clearly taken the side of trying to ""expose"" improprieties and alleged human rights violations.  I believe there are reasons for each of the detainees to be held, and what they do there is (and needs to be) classified for good reason.  These are not thrillseeker liquor store hold-up robbers with ""Born to Lose"" tattoos on their chests...

And unfortunately there is almost no mention of how the base exits in Cuba with so much animosity between the two nations.  Why does Cuba permit the base to operate there?  That seems like pretty important information to be included in a documentary about Gitmo, but there is not a word about that.

So, yes, it is a glimpse into the life of a guard at Gitmo, but it certainly was overly sympathetic to the detainees, even painting the former prisoners as upstanding family men, and who are now political servants in their own countries.  There are some things that the general public just simply should not know about, just ask Jack Nicholson's character Col. Nathan R. Jessup in ""A Few Good Men"":  ""I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it! I'd rather you just said thank you and went on your way.""",1325376000,3,1575,4.711678832116788
572801,3,6303058167,"I ordered this movie to use in class. It is 90 minutes in length and it gives a general overview of the prison at Guantanamo Bay while following along a couple of US military members. The footage was all filmed during a 3 week period but is supplemented with shots of other periods. There are also some interviews with former detainees that have been released back to their homeland. The movie tries to give a fairly balanced view of what went on, but tends to dwell a bit on the question of whether or not improper treatment took place. The depiction of what the place is like is quite accurate. The viewer comes away seeing how the place represents something of a no-win situation for the US and situation of prolonged desperation for the detainees. The only issue with the documentary is that it bogs down from time to time. The story probably could have been told in an hour or so. If you are interested in Guantanamo, it's worth checking this film out because there isn't much out there and this one represents almost unprecedented access to the camp by an outside film crew. The Guantanamo camp has been a very big image in the war on terror and it will probably always be remembered in the history books.",1321660800,6,1211,4.509090909090909
572802,3,6303058167,"I am teaching a college course on Guantanamo and want to start the first class by defending the Bush viewpoint.  This video shows guards stating there is no abuse of prisoners, interrogators saying they followed the Geneva conventions, and Bush saying Guantanamo is protecting us from further attack. The film sympathizes with the Americans there as well as with the prisoners, (It must be Hell to work there), and introduces us to many well-meaning Americans. There are hints that more than is visible is going on, but no images of any violence on the part of guards, and the most we learn is that the prisoners are angry and uncooperative since the film-makers were forbidden to speak to prisoners or view the high security prison. There is some mention of legal problems , but merely a suggestion that most of the men have proved to be innocent. The film seems even-handed unless you know that most of the men abused there have no idea why they were imprisoned, are low-level Taliban who were fighting the Northern Alliance, not Americans, and that guards, who are not even told the prisoners' names, are led to believe that all the men in custody are Al-Qaeda, which is not true.
If you use this for information, I recommend you do some independent reading about the prisoners and how they were captured.",1280793600,6,1308,4.762114537444934
572803,5,6303058167,I thought the DVD was informative.  I have a loved one at GTMO and wanted to know more about why in th heck are we still holding the detainees.  Seems illegal for and administration to capture people and not let them know why.  I just don't get it.,1258416000,3,248,4.125
572804,3,6303058167,"""National Geographic Explorer"" Inside Guantanamo Bay: 6 out of 10: National Geographic was given access to all but one of the various prisons at the Guantanamo naval base on the island nation of Cuba. The base holds prisoners captured while fighting the war on terror; and was used to house said prisoners without those pesky habeas corpus rulings or Geneva Convention rights. (The idea was that the base is in Cuba so it did not count as constitutional territory like a regular military base or embassy would; out of bounds if you will. Yes, an adult thought this up; why do you ask?)

Well, needless to say, you do not have to be a flaming liberal to see how holding prisoners indefinitely without charge or redress is a bad idea. The Supreme Court promptly slapped the Bush administration into next Tuesday; and politicians of all stripes quickly began defending themselves against Americans who had previously read that pesky Constitution.

The Obama administration has quickly moved to close the jail, and therefore this chapter in American history. The jail at Guantanamo will go down with Prohibition and the 55-mile an hour speed limit as one of those what were they thinking moments.

All of which makes a good chunk of Inside Guantanamo Bay mute. What we are left with is a military version of MSNBC's Lockup. In fact, Guantanamo so resembles a regular prison in America, one really wonders why the most of the prisoners cannot be moved to say Leavenworth or Pelican Bay.

A few things I did learn from the hour and a half documentary.
The prison 'guards' are just kids and woefully undertrained.
Don't be a dick seems a good rule of thumb.
Female civil rights lawyers are sexy.
Cuba has some big lizards.
I have George W Bush fatigue. (I found myself cringing when they showed his clips.)

Overall, more of an interesting historical novelty rather than a cutting edge documentary. Guantanamo is certainly no Abu Ghraib; and the sailors, for the most part, have nothing to be ashamed off in the way they conducted themselves. As for the politicians on both sides of the aisle? Well they clearly should have known better.",1248912000,2,2130,4.808743169398907

7839147,5,6303058167,"During the early 90's Coliseum Video  put out  HQ stuff
This is when the WWF had insight and understood what they were selling to the fans
There was no internet, no pro wrestling msg boards, etc.
The business as a whole was much more protected
There was also NWA/WCW  and a new indie federation known as Eastern Championship Wrestling so Vince and his knuckle heads had plenty of
competition in North America
This is one of those true buried treasures on vhs  for two interesting reasons
#1 Pre-Attitude era (Fans romanticizes the attitude era while it was a high point in the Monday Night war) it wasn't as big as people now make it I can understand why people cherish that time period though Pro Wrestling was as a all time boom mostly due to competition
but, the WWF was good prior to the attitude era mostly due in fact to some of the great talent they had locked into contracts

#2 You get Johnny Polo being a goof ball through out the 2hr.  tape  (He is so entertaining and fun to watch) This is interesting less then 5 years later he would magical appear in ECW under his new character ""Raven""
Johnny Polo and Raven are polar opposites
This tape is a good example how the die hard ECW fans that thought they were smarter then everyone else! They wasn't that smart in hindsight
Raven was Johnny Polo but, yet they swallowed the pill and acted like Polo never existed

If you wanna see a interesting time in early to mid 1990's WWF this is a spectacular  time capsule
I honestly doubt this complete version will ever be put on the failing WWE Network
This is one of there best non ppv vhs tapes ever",1450137600,,1604,4.391891891891892
