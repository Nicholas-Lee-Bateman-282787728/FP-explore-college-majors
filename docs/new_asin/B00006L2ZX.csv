Tabs (prints have no standard notations) have mistakes all over the place. 5 short solos written rhythmically all wrong and even have some wrong notes (where? For example: Solo#3, Bar 2, Beats 3&4, or  Solo#4 first bar of the second line, Beat 4...).
 Also, the most important part: I have a filling that tabs for the final song were written by me when I was 10. First of all there is no BARS or Beats, not even a note values (you have to ques the chord changes....) Player does not follow the metronome and his tempo is all over the place. Which makes it even harder to get the idea of the melody or phrase. It has some good info (especially for the beginners) in it but you can not do the 50% good and other 50% whatever job and sell it as a PRO Video lessons.
Please, do the pro job that people can use. Over all I would not recommend this DVD.",1346544000,,888,4.156976744186046
8403356,5,B00006L2ZX,"I've had this video a while. This in one of the better videos I have on teaching guitar lead. Todd shows very basic positions and scales he uses. Gives his thoughts of the positions he's thinking of, moving from lick to lick. Shows the licks in context in a progression of mini solos. Plus a solo call ""Lil' Bucky's "". I learned a lot from this video well worth the money.",1325635200,,372,4.253521126760563
8403357,4,B00006L2ZX,"I really enjoyed the DVD.  He is a very talented guitarist and provides great information in a format that is easy to follow.  I appreciate the individual breakdown of the segments he plays throughout his extended example piece.  I makes it easier to digest the material and see how the individual licks incorporate in the ""Big Picture"" of developing solos.  The split screen of both hand's activity is always a blessing for this type of instruction video.  Highly recomended.",1192579200,3,476,4.974683544303797
