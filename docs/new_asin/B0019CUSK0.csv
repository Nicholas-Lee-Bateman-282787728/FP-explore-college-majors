8273424,5,B0019CUSK0,"Terrifically acted by an amazing cast - Laurence Olivier, Alan Bates, Malcolm McDowell, and Helen Mirren - this is a fun, creepy and disturbing adaptation of the Harold Pinter play.

Not really opened up for TV (it was made for the BBC), more a photographed play. But the writing and acting are so delicious that the rough edged style doesn't matter, as we slowly piece together what did or didn't go on between McDowell and Mirren when they happened to meet at an hotel out of town, and the repercussions on their relationships at home; McDowell with Olivier, Mirren with Bates.

A must for any fan of Pinter's or the cast.",1344729600,,624,4.612612612612613
