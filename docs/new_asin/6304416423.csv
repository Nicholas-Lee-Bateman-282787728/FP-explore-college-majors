My 6 year old had some great empathetic moments towards baby Adam while watching this one- especially when he cried because all he wanted was his bunny and his mommy!

867090,2,6304416423,"I grew up on `Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' and I even remember seeing `Honey, I Blew Up the Kid' in the theater.  As a kid, this was wonderful.  Proof of that is that both of my daughters found this beyond hysterical last night as they watched it for the first time.  I, on the other hand, found it excruciating.  I'm baffled by all the talk on this board of this being superior to the original, but that may be pure bias and then again, I haven't seen the original in YEARS so maybe I'd have a similar reaction to that as I had to this.

`Honey, I Blew Up the Kid' takes place some years after the original.  The Szalinski family is considered freaks on their block (they are) and their kids, especially their teenage son Nick, are embarrassed of what their family, more precisely their father, has become.  Working on yet another invention, Wayne is now trying to enlarge things instead of shrink them and some cartoony villain in his office is trying to take his job.  Wayne makes another dumb mistake (because all geniuses are stupid) and his two-year old son Adam becomes the size of a small city (small exaggeration).  A slew of corny one liners are spewed and then regurgitated over and over until the drawn out ending (which lasts forever and just will not end) comes and then the movie is over.

The kid who plays Adam is cute enough, but there are many moments in the film where I'm certain they adlibbed because he messed things up.  The special effects end nicely, but watching Adam grow was messy and it was obvious that they struggled with adding realism to this concept (the disconnect between obvious green screens was bothersome).

Overall this was just rather dull for me, but my kids thought it was hilarious.",1359590400,,1725,4.511254019292605

  Many of you must remember the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" TV program in the '60's and '70s.  In particular, you might remember some of the quasi-science fiction flicks starring a young Kurt Russell as high-school student Dexter.  In ""high concept"" movies like ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"", ""The Strongest Man in the World"", and ""Now You See Him, Now You Don't"", Dexter would be subjected to wild, crazy plots where he would, respectively, gain super-intelligence, super-strength, and invisibility powers.  The movies were not too sophisticated, logical, scientifically sound, or intellectual, but they were fast paced and fun.  Disney's ""Honey, I..."" canon, especially ""Honey, I Blew Up the Kid"" (hereafter HIBUTK), would have been comfortably at home at ""Wonderful World of Disney"".

  Basic and straightforward as the plot is, I won't bother going into TOO much detail about it - maybe.  Wayne Szalinki's (Rick Moranis's) two-year old toddler son Adam(and his stuffed bunny) somehow accidentally gets into the path of the harried inventor's matter-sizing ray.  But instead of shrinking to the size of an ant, the lively charmer gradually grows larger, especially when stimulated by electromagnetic currents.  Despite Wayne's and his wife Diane's (Marcia Straussman's) efforts to conceal the mishap, Adam, the Amazing Colossal Baby, soon swells to skyscraper size and, naturally attracted to the pretty neon lights, lumbers towards Las Vegas.  Wayne races against time and a smarmy corporate and professional rival (John Shea) to restore his son to normal without hurting him and save Las Vegas from his innocent destruction. Oh, before I forget, Wayne must also save his older son Nick and his would-be girlfriend,whom Adam has grabbed and put into his overall pocket.

  It's easy to find fault with HIBUTK.  Overwrought characterizations, a non-dimensional villian, the impossibility of gigantism (Adam would have collapsed under his massive weight), occasionally dodgy special effects, yes they're all there.  But c'mon people, HIBUTK is a fairly absorbing and suspenseful melding of the time-tested ""Giant Monster on the Loose"" and ""Raising a Cute Kid"" plots.  It's also a fairly realistic portrayal of how a newly-enlarged child would react to his surroundings (everything is a toy) and the special, painstaking care the police and military have to employ to contain Adam safely.  I also think director Randall Kleiser should receive credit for being able to work with the Shalikar twins (who alternately play Adam) and coax an engaging performance from them, and also not forgetting the tentative relationship growing between Nick and his girlfriend in spite of their predicament.  Against the odds, HIBUTK works, and is even affecting.  If you don't tear up a little when a misplaced fighter tranquilizer shot makes Adam cry and drop the enormous ""Hard Rock Cafe"" guitar sculpture he's strumming, well then, you're truly emotionless.

  But never fear, all Adam needs is a strong female figure to settle him down. Wayne's matter-sizer converts Diane into a 300-foot ""mama grizzly"" who gets Adam to sit still, and Wayne returns both to normal.  Of course, we have a happy ending, and Adam has a 50-foot bunny to play with.

  Sometimes you have to bow to and enjoy the absurd.  That's what I did with HIBUTK.

867308,4,6304416423,"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid(1992) is the sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989). This sequel does something different by turning Wayne Szalinski's toddler son into a giant. Even Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater 3000 pointed out that the film is an homage to Bert I. Gordon's The Amazing Colossal Man(1957). There are a few deja vu moments in the film. Wayne Szalinski yells, ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids!"" after accidentally shrinking Nick(Robert Oliveri) and the babysitter with the Shrinking Ray. The mailman delivers mail to a box with ""Szalinski"" written on it. Bruce Broughton(Silverado, Lost in Space) composed the energetic music score for the film. The filmmakers went on location to Nevada to make the film. Randal Kleiser(Grease) directs the film. For a Hollywood movie made in the 1990's, it uses models, giant props, blue screen photography and little or no CGI. The stunt driving is quite good. Amy O'Neill from Honey, I Shrunk the Kids makes a brief cameo during the first ten minutes of the film. A young Keri Russell plays Mandy, the cute, nubile babysitter that Nick has a crush on. Marcia Strassman returns as Wayne's wife. Twins were used to portray Adam Szalinski. One twin improvised his acting while the other followed the director's orders. Julia Sweeney from Saturday Night Live plays a neighbor. John Shea plays the film's villain and Lloyd Bridges plays a kind, empathic rich guy. In Honey, I Blew Up the Kid(1992), Adam Szalinski is accidentally exposed to Wayne's industrial-sized ray gun. He grows in  size whenever he gets too close to electromagnetic waves. Adam causes (non-violent) Godzilla-like destruction to Las Vegas. Adam plays with real cars as if they were toy cars and he plays with Hard Rock Cafe's giant guitar! In 1993, Walt Disney Pictures was sued for stealing someone else's idea for this film. Some movie critics in 1992 didn't enjoy this film. Honey, I Blew Up the Kid(1992) is an underrated sequel.",1311120000,2,1958,4.969512195121951

  Plus it is exiting to see him stomping trough Las Vegas, as it it were a playground, towering above the downtown and the strip. Great for younger children because it is mostly about Adam, and believe it or not, its tamer than the original. Also great for adults-especially in Vegas! Its cute,funny, exiting, action packed and thrilling-
for all ages!

867310,3,6304416423,"I seem to like this sequel more than Honey, I Shrunk The Kids mainly because this is one of the movies that I grew up watching it. It's true that Honey, I Blew Up The Kid doesn't really hold up eighteen years later, but there are still some pretty good things about it. The story is just as weak as the one in the original, but at least the special effects are pretty fun to watch. There are some fun and silly scenes, as well as a pretty wacky music score by Bruce Broughton. The things I disliked the most about this movie were the lame one-liners said by Keri Russell, the cardboard cutout villain played by John Shea, and, as I mentioned before, the story which isn't really much to start with. In the end, I consider Honey, I Blew Up The Kid a bit of a guilty pleasure. The film beings a lot of nostalgia: I liked it back when I was a kid, and I still like it now (at least SOME of it).

But when he brings Nick & his toddler son Adam to see his invention, the machine unexpectedly starts working. And when Adam comes right up to the machine, he gets zapped along with his stuffed bunny. Now, whenever Adam comes near anything electrical, the electricity causes him to grow. Adam soon starts to grow to the height of 150 feet.

867472,4,6304416423,"The Szalinski Family has moved from Fresno to the Las Vegas suburbs.  Wayne (Rick Moranis) has been hired by the Sterling Corporation, and they are trying to use his original invention to enlarge things now, but it just isn't working.  One weekend while Diane (Marcia Strassman) is dropping Amy (Amy O'Neal in a cameo) off at college, Wayne figures it out.  Taking son Nick (Robert Oliveri) and the newest addition to the family, two year old Adam (Joshua and Daniel Shalikar), to the lab, he tries to make it work.

At first, he thinks he new idea was a bust.  But then Adam starts growing.  While Wayne tries to figure out how to reverse things, Diane and Nick just try to keep Adam calm.  But how to you keep a hyperactive two year old who is bigger than you from destroying the house?  Can they keep his sudden growth a secret?  And if he gets out of the house, how will they ever control him?

This movie came out while I still looked forward to all sequels to movies I had loved.  Okay, so this one doesn't quite measure up to the first, but it is darn close.  While there are some family issues, they are different than the ones from the original.  There are so many great jokes about Adam being a big boy even before he starts to grow.  Some of the special effects show their age, but for the most part, they work quite well.  John Shea's villain is absolutely wonderful.

That isn't to say this movie is a perfect sequel.  I was sad to see Amy leave so quickly.  There's only one slight reference to the Thompson family from the first one.  And the scenes with Adam in the Szalinski house are a tad too long and drawn out.

As an aside, Keri Russell makes her film debut here playing babysitter Mandy, the teen of Nick's dreams.

As far as sequels go, this one is pretty good.  It doesn't measure up to the original, but it has plenty of fun along the way.",1255046400,,1865,4.314121037463977

867474,3,6304416423,"Here's another example of the sequel being slightly better than the original, at least in my humble opinion. However, the original (""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"") was nothing super, not something you'd call a ""classic."" It was ""pretty good."" This one IS ""good.""

It had more laughs and less irritating kids. There is still the stupid teen romance, but not emphasized as much as in the first movie. The little kid in here, who is turned into a giant, is cute and affable and his giggle is fun to hear.

The first 40 minutes of this film are the best. It gets a little too silly after that. At the end, Disney succumbs to the craze of the early '90s: having a woman punch out a man. In this case, it was nice mother (Marcia Strassman.) Give me a break!

The special-effects were okay but not totally convincing. In fairness, it's not easy trying to produce the effects of a 100-foot child walking down the streets of Las Vegas, but they've still come along way from the days of ""The Attack Of The 50- Foot Woman"" in 1958. This movie would look more realistic with today's CGI technology.

However, even for all the shortcomings, this is a fun movie to watch with the kids.  Rick Moranis is reliably goofy and the special effects with a giant baby are not bad.  Really the only complaint I had was that Lloyd Bridges should've been given more screen time.  All in all, it's a good way to spend 90 minutes with the family.",1188864000,,515,4.414893617021277

I agree that the movie should have had more characters involved instead of sticking to the main family (for the most part) but that's not really a big problem.  The fact that the kid blows up and walks around doing some creative and amazing things positively makes this a great family movie, in my eyes.

867642,4,6304416423,"Usualy sequals to movies like this can really lack and leave a lot desired but this follow up to the hit ""Honey I shrunk the Kids"" is actualy a lot of fun and a nice change on the size changing themes that were developed in the first.
This movie realized that we probably saw enough of the shrinking and being lost in the backyard idea and decided to do the opposite. A few new characters were introduced in this movie to make things work. The most important being Wanyes new son Adam who is a 2 year old toddler and will be the focus of this latest instalment with the wacky inventor and his family.  Wayne now is part of a big company who wants to use his size alteration invention for their own uses.  The only problem is he can't get the growth part to work correctly. On a surprise visit to the lab with his two sons to do some extra work, 2 year old Adam accidently gets caught under the rays of the growth ray only to wind up growing very slowly over a long period of time. Before they can blink he has grown to over 100 feet tall and terrorizing
downtown Las Vegas.  To make matters worse an evil partner in the company is trying to take control of things and wants the kid destroyed.
Its a fun story that really has a lot of creative moments like His other son and the babysitter getting captured by the giant and stuck in his shirt pocked for most of the movie.  They make it look really realistic with the giant baby towering over some famous Las Vegas casinos and the crowd reacting pretty realisticly. Kinda like one of those silly Godzilla movies but still with a Disney charm to it.  It has a great story and a good climax and everything seems to end up happily ever after. Its defintely a movie that all ages would enjoy, some may not like it more then the first but this one relies more on fewer characters and a focus of one huge character compared to a lot of small characters. So its a fair tradeoff I feel and worked well.
Unfortunatly though the movie has a few problems. One was that they totaly write out the daughter sending her to college, the neighbors too are not mentioned and they don't really show a lot in the way of the kid growing . He sorta just is one size one moment and bigger another. They could have done a little more with such things but those are minor problems.
Bottom line. If you are looking for a fun, carefree and family safe movie. This is the one for you. If you liked the first or any of the ""Honey I..."" movies this is a must get for the colection. You won't be disapointed.",1045612800,7,2526,4.210743801652892
