6381627,4,B00JMLQGQ0,"As a horror movie its not very scary. As a B type horror movie with cult leanings it's fantastic!  The gore is ridiculously funny, the one liners both amusing and stinging at times, no one is trying to be serious, and random nudity to bump up the rating. It reminds me of the original Night of the Demons.",1405036800,,305,4.258620689655173
6381628,2,B00JMLQGQ0,"Some good concepts, but a truly messy script and goofy direction.  This really needed more focus and it certainly does not need to have a part two coming later.",1404864000,,160,4.517241379310345
6381629,3,B00JMLQGQ0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the movie. It's not a horror classic, but it's stylishly made, has very strong acting from the female leads, and an enjoyable premise. It's flawed and doesn't reach its potential, but I enjoyed it and would watch it again.

Brooke Butler was particularly good in her role. I'd have liked to have seen more done with her character. I look forward to following her career. Reanin Johannink also did a good job, adding subtle depth to a role that became more complex as the movie progressed. Fans of Reign already know to expect an entertaining performance from Caitlin Stasey. The performances are the movie's biggest strength.

The movie set up the sexual politics and character motivation well in the first half. This is where it is most successful as a whole. It needed to explore the zombie elements more, once they're introduced. What we saw was enjoyable, but ended up feeling truncated. The movie largely falls apart in the last third, feeling rushed, and that hurts it quite a bit. It has a nice stinger at the end promising more, and if there is a sequel, I'll pay to see it. That's possibly the best compliment you can give a movie.

Recommended for genre fans, but temper your expectations.",1404086400,,1231,4.742990654205608
6381630,4,B00JMLQGQ0,This is an odd horror movie because for the first quarter it doesn't really play like one. It plays more like a drama where a teenage outsider plans revenge on the people she blames for the death of a popular girl. Also of note there is a good deal of lesbianism in this if that matters one way or another for you. Personally that was selling point for me. The majority of the movie is a battle of the sexes between football players and cheerleaders with a bit of a zombie/wicca horror movie twist. In all honestly four stars is pushing it a bit. It is more a 3.5 but I go high when it is a genre I enjoy.,1403913600,2,605,4.05
6381631,2,B00JMLQGQ0,"A group of cheerleaders are killed in a car wreck and brought back to life by a witch classmate who is in love with one of the girls.  Of course, there are always consequences for that sort of thing.

It's hard not to get the impression that this was meant to be the good version of Jennifer's Body.  It's certainly better than that terrible horror comedy, but that's a pretty low bar.

The main problem with All Cheerleaders Die is that it seems to have been written by the usually reliable Lucky McKee and co-writer/director Chris Sivertson while playing a game of Mad Libs--the movie's plot and tone seems to keep changing every 10-15 minutes, so even when it seems like the movie is finally going to get good it ends up shifting gears again.  And again.

The movie doesn't seem to know what to do with its cheerleader protagonists and their Wicca savior--none are really developed as individual characters.  A potentially funny gag of two rival sisters being resurrected in each others bodies goes nowhere because neither sister has her own personality, so it hardly seems to matter which body they end up in.

All Cheerleaders Die has its occasional modest pleasures--a good gag here, a bit of T&A there, but it's mostly a mess that seems to have been slapped together quickly with very little thought or care.  It's a far cry quality-wise from previous Lucky McKee efforts like May and The Woman, but it's watchable enough as long as you keep your expectations extremely low.",1403049600,5,1481,4.709302325581396

6381633,5,B00JMLQGQ0,"I have to admit I was intrigued when I saw the trailer on Hulu plus.  The film's story line and plot are tight and well thought out.  The characters are setup nicely and the villain of the film is very believable.

This isn't the comedy horror I thought it was.  It's really great to watch and I was hooked all the way through.  Kudos to the directors and the screenplay writers.  I am now a big fan.  Definitely going to by the bluray.",1402358400,4,436,4.180722891566265

6381650,4,B00JMLQGQ0,"Don't let the reviews scare you away.  This one is worth watching.  It's not the best movie ever made, but it is a fun ride.

Plot Synopsis:  A teenager (Maddie) makes a videologue about her classmate Lexi, who happens to be the head cheerleader.  During the shoot, Lexi dies while showing off for the camera.  Maddie then joins the cheerleading squad, with the intent of making Terry (the captain of the football team)'s senior year a living hell.  Turns out, he raped her over the summer while she was comforting him about Lexi.  As things play out, we learn that Maddie's ex-girlfriend is a witch, which is a good thing for Maddie, as her plan for Terry goes awry, and the football team ends up killing her and the other cheerleaders.  Maddie's ex brings them back to life, and they take their revenge on the Terry and the rest of the team.

Directed by Lucky McKee (May, Masters of Horror, The Woods), this movie is oddly compelling.  The acting isn't extraordinary, and the script has some holes, but this movie stayed with me.  I found myself caring about Maddie and her friends, and hours after watching it, I kept thinking about the movie, how it ended, and how the characters' stories would continue.  The end credits bill this as Part 1, so I'm hoping there'll be a part 2.

It's not often that a movie stays with me like that and I credit Lucky McKee, as I had the same reaction after watching May.  Lucky is an under-rated director, and I feel this movie is worth watching.  Give it a shot.  You may be pleasantly surprised.",1422144000,4,1536,4.507246376811594

It's all fictional like most movies of this genre, none of it has any base of reality. But it was an ok movie over all and kinda similar to Jennifer's Body in my opinion. The only thing that was totally annoying was the end, it was left wide open and had you expecting more. At the end it said part 1 but I'm not really sure that this movie will generate enough revenue to do a sequel, not to mention it might be kinda cheesy. They could have just spent 5 more minutes to finish off the ending and been done with it in my opinion.",1422057600,,701,3.909090909090909

6381653,5,B00JMLQGQ0,"I actually really enjoyed this from start to finish, I wasn't expecting much from this movie but was quite entertained throughout, from the cool open sequence right up until the great ending! The story is pretty simple but plays out really well and keeps you interested, a bunch of high school cheerleader girls are partying out with some boys on the football team and a fight gets out of control as the girls are chased off the road in their car and killed, only to be brought back from the dead by their friend who practices dark voodoo and magic, soon the girls realise what has happened and go for their revenge, there's a few good little slight twists in the story too and a fantastic ending which is wide open for part 2! The cast is all good, some nice young cheerleader girls, the effects are all good and great fun, some bloody kills, nothing major gory, cool soundtrack too, for a low budget horror its money well spent, this is a bit more classy and better presented than your usual average cheap horror release, well worth picking up this one! its described as a horror comedy but its really not as I didn't laugh at any point, it has a few troma style moments but its more a Jennifer's body cross the craft type of movie!",1419379200,5,1234,4.416666666666667

""Occulus"" had a beggingmiddle ad fun old-school horror suspenseful ending.... I enjoyed this movie Allergan though it gave me flashbacks to. Jennifer's body,the craft, jaw breaker..and a few other female centered Indy horror flicks that made me enjoy thecheesyiness of this movie.

The acting itself is not terrible, these people are pretty talented even if they don't look quite right for their roles. The football players are a joke, I mean the cheerleaders are bigger than them, and the suppose to be hottie cheerleaders aren't even hot, except for Brooke Butler(damn she's hot!). Anyway, it's so bad it's actually kind of good. I think this movie deserves some credit cause there are a lot movies that try to achieve this and fail, they just end up feeling like lousy low grade movies. Especially all those straight to DVD horror comedies out there you find at Redbox and Netflix.

6381671,4,B00JMLQGQ0,"so i watched this earlier today, and it was very interesting. all cheerleaders die had some really fabulous elements, and even greater ambitions; it was able to execute some them.

the story follows a group of cheerleaders and football players at blackfoot high school. there is a dangerous energy that surrounds these two groups, who are driven by their popularity, good looks, and skill. as the movie opens, the head cheerleader is the subject of a student film documenting the rigors of cheerleading. right off the bat, we get a taste of the dark humor of this movie, as she is promptly dropped on her head in a brutal and hilarious moment. from there we slowly learn what contemptible creeps the jocks are, and and that one of the cheerleaders has ulterior motives when it comes to being on the squad and getting to know the guys. needless to say, all the cheerleaders die, but thanks to the extremely powerful magics of one of their exes, they all come back to life. not shockingly, they want blood and revenge.

there are several clever twists and turns in this movie, and it smartly turns many high school/horror/and gender film cliches upside down. but it is a slippery slope that all cheerleaders die walks. often, while skewering these norms, it also celebrates them. you can only claim to be subverting the patriarchy while showing scantily clad, hot girls for so long before your motives seem twofold, and that's mostly okay. like i said, the movie is generally smart, but it it what it is. there is also some frank conversation about the vile acts perpetrated by the football team, which i really appreciated. all too often, such matters are used lasciviously, and with little representation of actual consequences or pain.

the four actresses who played the cheerleaders were awesome, and really made the movie. they were able to be serious, wounded, angry, and, of course, cheery. the ex-girlfriend witch was a lot of fun, and brought a fairuza balk-like pale-gothness to her role. the football players contained the usual crew: the charismatic sociopath, the well-meaning failure, the follower, the gee-whiz guy, the stoner. the leader, in particular, is really the true monster of this movie.

at times the story gets stuck, but all cheerleaders die does a lot of good things, from an opening that smacks you in the face, an ending that provides a pleasant, open-ended surprise, and a middle stuffed with quality gender and social politics, as well as an excellent soundtrack, and groovy gore. the movie isn't perfect, but it tries hard to be more than what it appears. it's mostly successful. i would LOVE to see a sequel.",1408060800,,2640,4.86
6381672,4,B00JMLQGQ0,"Way more entertaining than it had any right to be.  A complete guilty pleasure.  A very good bad movie, but it looked as if the people making it knew that and had fun with it.  And Caitlin Stasey rocks!",1407801600,,202,4.128205128205129
6381673,2,B00JMLQGQ0,"I'd only recommend this to the most adventurous horror-goer with a good sense of humor and low expectations. There's nothing special here and the tone erratically shifts.  But there's some bonkers humor for those who enjoy such flavor.

After the tragic death of the captain of the cheerleading squad, her meek outsider friend Maddy (Caitlin Stasey; Evidence, I Frankenstein)cleans up and goes undercover as an enthusiastic pom-pomer to expose these mean girls for what they really are.  Early in her sting operation, during a beer bash Maddy and her close newfound cheerleader friends are wronged by the captain of the football team (resulting in their accidental death) and now she has an entirely new target.

But wait, Maddy died.  So how could she exact her revenge?  The answer here is weird little divination stones (or Wicca witch rocks or something, not sure what to call them exactly).  A full moon, a little blood and the right cast of the stones seemed to be enough to resurrect three wrongly killed cheer squad members essentially by accident.  They basically turn into super strong, zombie succubi and they show up to school the next day with a killer new sexy look and an appetite that is to die for! Clich.

Co-writer/directors Lucky McKee (The Woods, May, The Woman) and Chris Sivertson (I Know Who Killed Me) don't really bring us anything special this time around.  Their actors are weak and inexperienced (but serviceable, I guess), the effects are mundane, none of the characters develop at all, and the story and execution is weak.  Strangest and least consistent is that the tone and direction of the movie change erratically between scenesshifting from a zombie succubus cheerleader revenge movie to a weird gemstone-eating dude versus a bunch of scared cheer zombies.  That sentence probably made no sense--rest assured that neither does the movie

But there were some fun perks.  After the resurrection two of the girls accidently switched bodies, there's a randomly hilarious ""cat kill"", we see a lot of girls in their undies, and some bonkers dumb-but-funny things end up happening.

That said, I'll only recommend this to the adventurous horror goer with a good sense of humor and low expectations.",1407369600,5,2227,5.029972752043597

6381675,1,B00JMLQGQ0,"I can count on one hand movies that got a ""hated it"" from me. Here's the first well produced movie that did. Luckily, I didn't pay for it, as it showed up on Netflix. I don't really go for horror flix devoid of appropriate atmosphere. High School is not a setting for good  horror/dread atmosphere. High School dances have been successful settings. High School doesn't have to be anti-atmospheric setting. But you have to do something with it. Transform it in some way, some how. This one does nothing but show you a typical high school's day to day life. The so-called horror is embedded within that, and of course, it includes the typical high school histrionics in the story/dialogue. The alleged ""horror"" trappings were also cheaply handled. Cheaply as in effort, not money. Need some blood, OK, open an artery. No attention to the setting in which that happens. No thought to build something, like an experience for instance. Visually, the entire magical level felt totally fake. My ability to suspend disbelief is pretty strong but this one was over my limit. Stones that light up and glow and make people's bodies glow, for instance. Just because. The girl who had them didn't even think it would work! Lucky her, I guess. The scenes involving blood were also looked fake sans atmosphere. Ditto the funny voice (an attempt at the demonic?) .  It screamed computer generated.  If you take the time to craft horror atmosphere, the viewers brains are ripe to minimize any allusions to reality and you can pull it off when you are constrained by money or imagination. Here it all was glaringly fake. There just was nothing, nothing here for me at all. I did not have any positive expectations either. That's why I put off seeing it until it showed up on Netfllx.

6381678,5,B00JMLQGQ0,"Lucky McKee is a greatly underrated writer/director - with that said onto the review: This is a remake of a film Lucky & Chris Sivertson did back in 2001 - The original was his first film out of film school - The plot is this you have football players & cheerleaders, they party, mess around there is a car wreck and the girls die, no spoiler there as it is the name of the film - There is a witch girl who is in love with the Caitlin Stasey character Maddy - she brings them back to life with some magic and the girls have a craving for blood and whipping some football players butts - there are so many fun parts of this film, the characters - especially the cheerleaders, they are just brilliant and so awesome to watch - there is blood & guts, supernatural powers running wild. This is a fantastic film loaded with so many things that made me smile - now be warned the ending it abrupt(and may make some people mad) but in my opinion it just made me crave a sequel asap - the end credits say ALL CHEERLEADERS DIE part one - so it is a given that a part two is coming and i for one am all for it - grab this film and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.

DVD or BLU RAY? - both have the same features - an almost half hour making of, which is informative and fun to watch - but that is the only features - so grab whatever format you prefer.",1406419200,2,1345,3.9448529411764706
6381679,2,B00JMLQGQ0,"Takes itself far, far too seriously for it's premise, lacking most the horror/comedy elements hinted at in some excellent ads. An extra star on account of progressiveness (a lesbian relationship gets treated exactly as a straight relationship would be) but overall just as overly melodramatic as a real teenager, with very little humor and not enough horror to make it worth while.
Skip this, watch ""Detention"" to see a movie that delivers on what this one promises.",1406419200,,466,5.064935064935065

6381681,3,B00JMLQGQ0,"This is a film that showed early promise, was a great idea, but the actors, dialogue, and plot couldn't bring it on. The film starts out as a reality film as they watch and interview a cheerleader. When she is killed while performing ""America's most dangerous sport"" her friend Maddy (Caitlin Stasey) takes her spot with the intent of enacting revenge especially on football player Terry (Tom Williamson). Added to this mix is witch Leena (Sianoa Smit-McPhee) who makes things happen with stones and crystals that act like a Monkey's Paw.

The film takes 30 minutes to develop. It was good getting there. Once we entered into the meat of the film, the writers didn't know what to do. Or at least they didn't do it well. Character build up was mostly ineffective.

Asylum production. Okay as an inexpensive rental.

6381683,2,B00JMLQGQ0,"Oh my!  I went into this expecting sort of a dark comedy, but instead I got an all-out TERRIBLE movie!  The acting wasn't bad.  It was the general direction that the story went that eventually took this movie from at LEAST a solid 3 down to a LOW 2 stars.  The first five minutes had me ready to throw a 5 star at it, but as time went on, so did the promise of a entertaining couple of hours. (or what eventually felt like days!)

The story begins with Matty (Caitlin Stasey) making some sort of documentary.  She decides to follow the cheerleaders around and reveal how things really are with them.  Head cheerleader, Alexis attempts to show off for the camera and ends up with a broken neck.  Matty decides to do a tribute to Alexis instead and the story continues.

The night before their Senior Year, the football players,......WAIT A MINUTE here?!  Let me elaborate on these so called ""football players"".  Now I'll admit, it's been roughly 16 years since I was in high school, but I don't recall our football players looking like this?  I'm pretty sure these guys wouldn't actually be good enough to be 3rd string on the JV team.  But in this movie, these are the Kings of the High school?!  I can't even imagine,.....  Anyways, the football players all decide to have their annual ""guys only"" party (whatever that means) and the girls all head to a secluded location to have a girls only party after getting rejected by said, Jocks.  Long story short, the cheerleaders all end up dead and that's where the movie REALLY goes downhill.

The only REAL horror this movie produces is the possibility of a sequel!  It's ending leads into it and before the credits role, it lists this movie as ""Part 1"".  Yeah, I told you it was scary!

Final Verdict:  Definitely PASS!",1405555200,3,1768,4.531645569620253

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***

This movie had little to no plot. The movie started with a cheerleader being killed at one of her practices.  The story itself mainly relied on having somewhat attractive women in skimpy outfits running around on screen and occasionally acting slutty with guys they claimed to hate and want revenge on.

So some cheerleaders decide they are going to a party and they have their boyfriends come too. At the party two of the cheerleaders decide they want to date each other rather than their boyfriends. Then when they break the news to one of the guys, they throw it in his face, tease him, belittle him, insult him and say his manhood his small, etc. Now they already knew he had a bad temper, and that he was violent and loved inflicting pain on others on the football field. So what do you think he did to her? Yep, he belted her in the face so hard it knocked her on her ass like she got hit by a freight train and she started bawling like a baby.

Sweetie, what did you think was going to happen? He's twice your size, is like 200 pounds of pure muscle and has a real short temper. Not to mention you knew he was violent, border-line psychotic, and solves most of his disagreements with his teammates with physical violence. Now it's NEVER okay to hit a woman and I'm not excusing his actions for one second, but use your head woman! Don't poke the bear!

Moving on, then the girls are all killed in a car crash and they are then resurrected by the local Wicca girl and they all gain super strength and drink blood to keep their strength up. The main football guy figures out something is wrong as his buddies are being killed off by the girls. So he finds them and starts stealing their strength. But he is eventually killed and the cheerleader that died at the very beginning of the movie is brought back to life and we are shown that this was only part one of a series.

This movie was just horrible! The acting was awful, the dialogue was terrible, and there is nothing that will make me want to watch this again or see the next movie in the series.
