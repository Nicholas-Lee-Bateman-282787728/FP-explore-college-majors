8702409,5,B00TOTNZM8,"It comes from a novel by  Victor Hugo, and you feel Hugo all t he way back. But they made a good opera from it, and I am sorry for Lafont when he was killed.....but not too much. The modern rendition is good, the singers are more than adequate and the prison, well. is a prison. I found this opera very  attractive,  again a new one, where are all my prejudices for modern music going ? It speaks more to  your intellect than to you r heart, but  it reaches you. Yes, I still prefer Verdi and Wagner and Bellini, bu t Claude is not wasted time. On  the contrary.",1454630400,3,562,4.0636363636363635

8702411,5,B00TOTNZM8,"A contemporary opera where finally music, text, and performance have no parellel. I was so intrigued that I read the story on whch it was based.  i was totally floored.  A Victor Hugo story about gay love in prison!!!!!  When I was in graduate school, nobody even mentioned it . And the icing on the cake: An opera about it .  As erotic as Lulu, better 100 times than Brokeback Mountain, snd only comparable to The House of the Dead..  The three principals are simply awesome. Albin is played by a black countertenor, the first I have heard, adding a surpising racial  dimension the the unflinching depiction of homosexual love. This opera sort of rstores my faith in European productions, so plagued by Eurotrash, which this is not.  I am still reeling from watching it..",1440288000,7,772,4.674074074074074
8702412,5,B00TOTNZM8,I ordered this today and will update this review when I have received the DVD.  I saw this originally when it was streaming online.  It was an intense experience and definitely not for the faint of heart.  The performances were superb.  The available titles were in French which I did not understand and I am very glad that this has appeared in a commercial release with English titles.,1430697600,9,386,4.632352941176471
