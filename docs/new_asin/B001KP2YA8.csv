3667841,5,B001KP2YA8,This is my second Harlequin movie and it was very good.  I loved the filmography in Africa and all the animals.  The idea of twins being separated at birth was interesting.  There could have been more action but it just wasn't that kind of movie.,1503273600,,246,4.4222222222222225
3667842,3,B001KP2YA8,"it wasn't exactly what I expected, it was okay. I thought it started out slow, the story line was okay and I did watched it all the way through. I just thought there would be more to the story line. I may have to watch it again",1398297600,,227,3.851063829787234

3667844,4,B001KP2YA8,"I purchased this DVD to add to my collection of works with appearances by Chad Everett. Not being a fan of Harlequin romances and Mills & Boon books, this 2003 movie with Tim Dutton, Chad Everett, Polly Shannon and Nicholas Campbell provided me with a pleasant surprise. A private detective who becomes obsessed by a clients' murdered daughter finds himself on a game reserve in South Africa, face to face with the dead girl's twin sister ! He enlists her help to entrap the killer and not only do they unravel the murder but love blossoms. Well acted, a good story and surprisingly 'hard to forget'. I liked it.",1351468800,3,612,4.623853211009174

Good story - Good film.,1344556800,,359,3.736842105263158

8315721,4,B001KP2YA8,"This movie has many wonderful qualities especially the art work and fine sensitive acting. The geographical beauty as well as the lovely/handsome actors make this movie worth watching more than once. The story is interesting but gives way to the overall warmth and deep felt emotion you get while watching it unfold in South Africa. Kudos to the director and all involved.
Easy to remember this one.",1510444800,,399,4.970149253731344
8315722,1,B001KP2YA8,"The music was real pretty in this movie but the story was real hokey.  There was an COMPLETELY unnecessary and long nasty sex scene that had to be fast forwarded.  Real short ending, all of a sudden it was over with no built up and predictable ending.  Real waste of time.",1508025600,3,272,4.294117647058823
8315723,5,B001KP2YA8,"Max Warner becomes enthralled with a woman who died. They tried to prove the husband killed her, but failed.

Then one day Max sees the woman he's been staring at in videos in a poster and chases the lead until he finds her.

The woman he'd fallen in love with...or was it her after all?

Good movie.",1507766400,,300,4.228070175438597
