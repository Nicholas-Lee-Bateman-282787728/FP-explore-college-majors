611710,1,6303241379,"This version is 67 minutes long. The previous version on VHS and on some other DVD is 73 minutes.

Note - Even the 73 minute version is cut.

There is a very important scene involving the taking of tires. Part of the scene showing important information to the story is cut.

I fortunately caught the uncut film on PBS a number of years ago, thus was able to notice this.

By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.

Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews",1114905600,11,760,4.5588235294117645
611711,3,6303241379,"In this wartime (1943) East Side Kids picture, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey), East Side boxing champion, is scheduled to meet the West Side kingpin in the ring for the City title, but is kidnapped by several thugs just before the bout, resulting in Muggs' friend and fellow gang member, Danny Lyons (Bobby Jordan) replacing him and defeating the West Sider, only to have Muggs believe that Danny was responsible for the abduction in order to achieve glory. The film is marked by the clever ad libbing skills of the entourage which, while at times intentionally corny, help to propel the story rapidly along and the customary East Side mixture of boxers, gangsters, and patriotic propaganda is leavened with a dash of romance and a funny jitterbug contest featuring big band singer/comedienne Marion Miller, all competently directed by Wallace Fox.",1104019200,,845,5.086330935251799
611712,2,6303241379,"This Monogram Picture of The East Side Kids is much slower than the later Bowery Boys incarnation. The last 15 minutes of this 64 minute movie is devoted to World War II patriotism. Nothing wrong with patriotism, this film just makes war look honorable. The beginning of the film aims at Muggs getting Kidnapped, but the bulk of the story is about the relationships between the gang members of The East Side Kids. Leo Gorcey's humorous banter is there for us to enjoy, and Huntz Hall is a scene stiller!
The FRONT ROW DVD is mastered from an original 16mm print, the sound is crisp and clear and the picture is sharp with good contrast. However the original print used in the transfer has many splices, at least four times a word of conversation is lost in a splice. Considering the ""Poverty Row"" aspects of Monogram Pictures I can accept this and enjoy the clear picture.  The dark night scenes show some artifacting, but they are few and far between. Usually the picture is sharp and clear.",1028160000,5,992,4.604519774011299
611713,4,6303241379,"This low-budget movie is a superior entry in the East Side Kids series. The emphasis on courage, integrity, and patriotism goes well with the WWII era of the film. Muggs (Leo Gorcey) is the epitome of the East Side wise guy. The fact that he can bully everybody on the East Side makes him a leader of the gang. Nice guy Danny (Bobby Jordan) is in love with Muggs' sister, Ivy. Danny heeds his mother's plea to only fight for a righteous cause (e.g., country). This gets him in trouble with both the gang and Ivy because his reluctance to defy Muggs appears cowardly. When crooks prevent Muggs from boxing in the East/West championship match, Danny steps in, wins the fight, but earns Muggs' enmity. Glimpy (Huntz Hall) and Scruno (Sunshine Sammy Morrison) are around for comic relief. The gang pokes fun at Alderman Klinkhammer, a hack politician. Klinkhammer hosts a campaign dance that includes a hilarious jitterbug contest. Danny and Ivy are finalists and vie with Muggs and his date for the $50 prize. This is a high-point in the film, even the entire series. Check out Glimpy's Amazonian date as she towers over the crowd. The '40s swing music captures the right note of toe-tapping fun. The poverty row, Martha Raye wannabe band singer is funny, too. The technical quality of the film could be better. The film and the soundtrack jump around in several places. This looks like a flaw in the original film, and not the VHS transfer. The East Side Kids, if not lovable, are tolerable in small doses. These little movies do not pretend to be more than they are. This one has serious overtones besides the silly hi-jinks. Recommended viewing. ;-)",1017792000,2,1649,4.729166666666667
611714,4,6303241379,"The story centers around Muggs and Bobby Jordan. Bobby fills in for Muggs at a boxing match and that's where the trouble starts. The film is fast, funny, and very entertaining. Huntz Hall  and the rest of the gang are there too. Look for the scene with the dancing  contest. It is very good! Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall put on a good and hillarious dance act! This film is a winner!",1010620800,,380,4.263888888888889

This was adopted from the `Saturday Evening Post' story ""The Old Gang"" by Paul Ernst. The movie begins with a view of two East River bridges. Two young men practice boxing. The boys look for Danny. The visit the pool hall to challenge a man with money. [Note the pinball machines.] ""Where's the dough?"" He is sucker-punched! He goes to see some gamblers about fixing an amateur boxing match. A news photographer invites Muggs for a ride. A trick to force a disqualification? [The comments refer to war-time conditions.] Danny doesn't do too well at first. But he wins. Muggs blames Danny for this. Danny gets a job at a garage. [Ration tickets are needed for gasoline.] He learns about what happened from Harry Wyckoff. Muggs won't listen to Danny's explanation.

Later the boys visit that pool hall and its back room. There is a fight for action. They are arrested and appear in court. The judge says they can end up in jail unless they behave. A politician throws a dance for the voters. [Does that dancing look funny today?] There is a jitterbug contest. Couples are removed until only a few remain. The winners are disqualified because Muggs' partner is a professional. Muggs is a sore loser. [Does Danny give in too easily?] There is news about an atrocity in Czechoslovakia! Can Americans pass a citizenship test? [If not, what does it say about schooling?] Muggs starts thinking about things. Danny bought a ring for Ivy. Popcorn too? ""Oh, Danny!"" Muggs has a plan to get new tires.[Rationed during the war.] Danny learned new skills in the Army. Next two join the Marines and the Navy. Ivy joins the WAACs.

This movie is like a TV show from the 1950s. It fills up the time with prosaic drama that reflects life as seen by Hollywood. Note a neighborhood with few cars and many small businesses. The moral is to warn teenagers against following a leader who has flawed judgment. But they may not grasp the concept.",1470960000,,1946,4.684210526315789

7842128,3,6303241379,"By the time the Second World War had started, Leo Gorcey had already made a name for himself as the tough East Side thug, who along with Huntz Hall, Billy Hallop and Gabriel Dell proved to be pleasant diversions from the lingering aftereffects of the Depression.  When the paying audience saw Gorcey as Mugs McGinnis they knew that they would view some pretty funny ad libbing and mangling of English. In KID DYNAMITE, Gorcey continues this trend but to a new purpose. The first half is your routine East Side Kid adventure with Gorcey being kidnapped so Billy Hallop could fight in his place and win a boxing match. Gorcey gets to shine in a vastly amusing dance contest with Huntz Hall also showing his hoofer abilities. But the real star is the United States Army which is praised in ways that sound mind numbing when compared to how the military is depicted today as vicious, hateful, and murderous. In the innocent 40s, the military was glorified to the extent that even the low browed East Side Kids could find redemption merely by wearing the uniform. THE DYNAMITE KID is a period piece that shows that innocence is a trait that need never go out of style no matter what garbage Brian DePalma might put out in REDACTED.",1195084800,2,1226,4.623853211009174
