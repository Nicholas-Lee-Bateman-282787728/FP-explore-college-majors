1650253,3,B00005QW9L,"I do agree with all of the other reviewers, the acting was great, especially one of the main girls played by Piper Perabo. It was basically a story about a girl (the narrator) going to an all girls boarding school and finding out that her two roommates are in love. There isn't a problem until one of the sisters of the roommates walks in on them and people start to suspect things. This causes a problem among the schoolmates and one of the girls makes a decision that will change things for both of them forever.
Like I mentioned, the acting was very good and the storyline or idea kept you interested for a while, but there were parts where it dragged. There were also things in it (my friend called it ""like an afterschool special"") that seemed to be like ""fillers"" and weren't very important. i never got into the stuff about the bird and the friendship with the gardener.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who feels uncomfortable watching two girls having a love scene. I found the emotion throughout the film very strong and I really felt for the characters. I was just expecting more at times.",995932800,14,1103,4.52

1650378,3,B00005QW9L,"One would think a film by four people would have a level-headed approach to the main focus, the emotional confusion of love often felt by young people from dysfunctional families.  However, it seems each contributor was trying to force their style into an easily portrayed story, leaving the audience feeling somewhat lost and disappointed.  The story-line is simple and makes for a good movie; but, the creators put too much nonsense into it for it to be good for second or third viewings.  Most notably, the white-trash song that pops up repeatedly throughout the film will make you want to keep your finger near the mute button.

Reference the film description and remarks on the back cover of the DVD case:  It's painfully obvious that these were not written by anyone who actually watched the film.  Firstly, Roger Ebert states, ""A superbly told story!"" and ""Erotic! Gorgeous!"".  It's a very simple story, that doesn't take a great deal of imagination or skill to tell.  There are no ""Erotic!"" scenes.  And, the actresses, though attractive (especially Mischa Barton), are not ""Gorgeous!""--they're realistic in appearance (The acting seems awkward and forced at times, most likely due to horribly poor direction; but, the girls themselves seem like normal and realistic people.).  Secondly, according to REEL.com, it is ""A moving and erotic depiction of the pangs of first love (in an all-girl environment)."", a comment that should offend the creators.  From a viewers perspective, it's a film about the emotional confusion of love felt by young people who have been rejected by dysfunctional parents; and, it's definitely not an ""all-girl environment"".  Much of the plot is based on the interaction between girls and boys (I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the film for anyone.).  And, thirdly, the description refers to Mary as ""Mouse"", a nickname that was completely and strategically rejected by the other characters in the beginning of the movie, incorrectly refers to the school as being a college (It's a boarding school, as stated in the movie.), and incorrectly says that Mary is torn between her two friends (She is anything but torn between her two friends.).

Overall, it's an ""okay"" movie.  However, it could have been something so much better, especially with higher class music and more realistic drama.",1417564800,2,2330,5.06282722513089

1650418,4,B00005QW9L,"""Lost and Delirious"" is a touching, realistic story of a doomed first love for two college students. The only differences between this and dozens of similar movies over the years are (1) this movie is considerably better made than most, and (2) the two students are women.

The film is set at an exclusive Canadian girl's college. Paulie (Piper Perabo, best known for TV's Covert Affairs) is the school rebel who refuses to acknowledge authority, and she and roommate Tory (Jessica Pare, the current Mrs. Don Draper on Mad Men) seem to inhabit a world of their own, without much concern for what others around them think. Tory and Paulie are actually more than just good friends; they have been carrying on an affair, which, when their third roommate, Mouse, learns about it, she is happy to keep a secret. Unfortunately, it doesn't remain a secret long when some of the other girls walk in on the pair in bed together. Tory, who comes from a wealthy family, is able to convince herself that the relationship was just a bit of harmless fun and tries to convince everyone else it never happened. Paulie, however, is deeply in love and doesn't want the relationship to end.

The film belongs to Piper Perabo (better known for TV's Covert Affairs), whose Paulie tries to hide her hurt and longing behind a faade of literary braggadocio (at one point, she actually challenges Tory's new boyfriend to a swordfight duel). As often happens with young people, her attempts to act adult through her hurt reveal her actual immaturity and lack of understanding of the world. As she acts out her hurt feelings, Tory tries to extinguish her own feelings and get distance, both dramatic and literal, between her and Paulie. The two girls have a third roommate, freshman Mouse (Mischa Barton), a shy girl who initially was thrilled to be part of their circle but now finds herself a helpless observer. Both Pare and Barton are good, but the movie belongs to Perabo.

Films like this often become either silly or excessively prurient, but the emotions in this one are genuine and raw. The movie doesn't avoid sensuality, there's a fair amount of nudity and softcore love scenes, but, more than anything it's a story of a doomed love affair. Piper Perabo's raw emotions that are on display throughout the second half of the movie make this film a sad and powerful experience.",1394496000,2,2358,4.7745098039215685
1650419,5,B00005QW9L,"This movie, I believe, is very important for young girls to watch.  There are so many aspects to young love portrayed in this movie.  I am unsure if a movie has moved me as much in a very long time.",1389916800,2,198,3.925

It was weird and certain parts in the movie (mainly when Piper is loosing her mind) I felt really uncomfortable. The sex scenes were great though if that's the only reason you want to watch it.

1650456,5,B00005QW9L,"I loved this movie.  Why?  For one thing, the acting on all people was superb and particularly the two girls who loved each other..so real!  It's a sad, tragic story but written in a way that isn't simply sap but has a huge amount of substance!  It was also a hip, cool film.  I have recently watched a series of movies with a storyline of two women loving each other.  This one though was different because it was powerful and I couldn't tear myself away until this movie reached it's conclusion!  And as a side note, the woman were all EXTREMELY EASY ON THE EYES!  I highly recommend this film but be warned: it could be considered depressing but often realistic movies are; the ending and the entire movie will stay with you long after it has been viewed.",1373155200,2,758,4.402877697841727

1650460,4,B00005QW9L,"Another girls' school flick.  Ugh.  Chicks rousting each other.  (raspberry).  So I watched it because I like Piper Perabo.  Yes, a bit of nudity, and some ""lesbian"" writhing.  But if you actually watch the movie, it has some teeth.  Maybe it's because I knew a young woman who went through much of what this movie portrays, not as crazy, but all the slings and arrows of someone attracted to the same sex in a time when such was verboten (German: forbidden).  I never could understand all the hate and invective aimed at her simply because she wasn't just another ""boy toy"".  She grew up to be a marvelous person and a woman, in spite of some times I wasn't sure she'd survive.  This movie reflects some of that struggle.  No, not your modern ""let's praise gays"" movie, just a very realistic portrayal of someone trying to find herself, whom and what she really is, and struggling with a dysfunctional family background.....well, no Oscar, but I found it to be a good, satisfying movie, with three especially good actresses who didn't do characters, but rather realistic people in a condemning situation.  I recommend it, especially if you want to learn that gays can be real people too, and teens  really do have to figure things out, sometimes with feelings the hard way, gay or straight.  No, I'm not gay; yes, I went to a private school (military academy) with many of the same prejudices; no, I'm neither pro-gay or anti-gay, I just feel people should be allowed to be themselves, and don't need a lot of unnecessary garbage from individuals on a power trip (that includes all kinds of bullies).",1364860800,4,1601,4.691756272401434
1650461,4,B00005QW9L,"Piper Perabo plays half of a hot-for-each-other ouple until the younger sister of her girl walks in on them at an inopportune time and threatens to expose all to their parents unless they stop.  Mischa Barton (The O. C.) is the new girl at school that they accept as roommate, and her character plays as observer as the girls try to hide their illicit affair. Piper is playing a much darker character here than in Imagine Me and You but reveals some solid acting chops I really didn't expect but happily enjoyed.  I want to see more of her talent involved in telling our stories.  The ending is purely metaphor that built beautifully throughout the film but it took me totally by surprise.  I'm glad I added it to my library.",1362787200,,725,4.511450381679389

1650488,5,B00005QW9L,"There are only a handful of lesbian-themed film that really stand out in my mind. They are the ones I watch over and over and get drawn into every time. This is one of those films. Piper Perabo is a wonderful dramatic actress, and this is one of her best performances. The intensity of her character really makes the movie. She is totally believable as a teen hopelessly in unrequited love. The love scenes are passionate and powerful. You will not be disapointed.",1355875200,2,464,4.602409638554217

'Lost and delirious' takes us on a ride to an all girls boarding school and the events that take place there with two students in particular, and all these events being witnessed by a student as well. As for the performances, it is nothing short of the word 'fabulous' or 'brilliant'. The three leads, Mischa Barton, Jessica Pare and Piper Perabo deliver top notch performances and specially Perabo who easily steals the show. The film may have thrown enough light on homosexual affairs, but just look closer, you will find much more in it. Overall a very simplified direction from Lea Pool and Mischa Barton's brilliant narration makes the film worthwhile.",1349568000,,720,4.909836065573771

1650491,3,B00005QW9L,"The movie starts out with a fascinating dynamic and I thought it was going to be more about how Mischa Barton was going to cope with sharing a boarding school dorm room with two lesbian roommates who are in love with each other. Now before you run for the hills thinking this is some either cheesy and sleazy premise, it's not.

The problem is this is another teenage angst movie with far too much angst and not emphasis on the teenage experience.

Why is it almost every movie that deals with troubled teens end in violence? I just thought (SPOILER ALERT) once the two lesbian girls split up that the entire story fell off the rails. I was, in fact, more interested in Mischa Barton's idea to help out the head gardener Graham Greene with the school's gardening chores. That was a better movie to be honest as Barton shows exactly why she was picked to star in ""The O.C."" as her talent at even this young age comes through.

Anyway, worth renting but not buying just to catch Barton's acting chops.",1322524800,,999,4.478021978021978

1650493,5,B00005QW9L,"Jessica Par was the draw for me.  She does a wonderful job of acting, becoming totally believable in the role of a young boarding school teen (Tori) whose hormones have driven her into the arms of a female roomate, Paulie (Piper Parebo). Young and inexperienced Mary (Mischa Barton) is thrown into their lives as their new roomate, and remains interested but aloof. Mary gradually becomes accepted at the school and is privy to Tori and Paulie's lovemaking, which both confuses and ensnares her in voyeuristic longings.
Plot complications include a gardener as a surrogate father for Mary, an injured falcon nursed to health by Paulie, and Tori's discovery of and experimentation with boys from a nearby boy's school.
As a strongly heterosexual male, I was surprised to find my interest held by, and my sympathies develop for the 3 lead characters. I ached to help all three discover themselves, rise above their troubled histories and learn to fly free.

1650518,5,B00005QW9L,"I am a retired professional and married male who only recently discovered the charismatic cinematic persona of Piper Perabo. I blindly purchased ""Lost and Delirious"" expecting another spirit-uplifting ""Perabo"" experience in this film. It was anything but. Instead it was very sad. This was an excellently produced classic Shakespearean tragedy reflective of modern times. Love is a totally psychotic manifestation. Love normally starts out at the beginning as a euphoric experience, an experience that normally slowly fades to everyday life. If, however, things turn sour, euphoric love can instantly turn dysphoric. ""Lost and Delirious"" successfully explores both extremes of this love-psychosis duality phenomenon.

Also, it correlated very heavily with my own personal history. It took me back into my teenage years when I experienced the very same life-situation with my then teen-aged girlfriend, my first and only ""real"" love to this day. It resurrected all the dysphoria: the life-altering event followed by the ensuing excruciating pain and despair following our break-up. That film hit much too close to home for comfort. It was much too real!

The bonding with ""The Raptor"", an injured falcon that Paulie discovers, befriends, and nurses back to health and independence also added much significance to the story. Been there, done that. I also bond best with G-d's critters.

Although most of the characters are female, this is not a lesbian flick; the characters are much too young to have made that decision at this early phase in their lives. It is, however, very strongly bi-curious. It is a very sensitive classic love story that reflects real people experiencing real life in real situations. The cast was excellent. The production was excellent. The acting was excellent. The writing of the screen-play was ultra-superb!

The UPS guy delivered the DVD about three weeks ago, from Amazon, of course. I have been totally mesmerized by it from the first viewing. I have replayed it at least once daily since I first viewed it. I have memorized almost all the dialog, including the Shakespearean quotes. I have never done this with any other film. I hated Shakespeare in high school. A thorough understanding of all the Shakespearean quotes and their context in the movie is essential to its deepest enjoyment.

I am an avid sci-fi fanatic. All of my favorite films to date have always been sci-fi related. This film has now become my number one and all-time favorite, relegating all the sci-fi films to far distant second place.",1287705600,5,2541,5.18780487804878

1650522,5,B00005QW9L,"Need one reason to see this film? It could be because it is the most beautiful story of two young women in love and the breakdown of their relationship, or the one reason to see this film is the incredible acting ability of Piper Perabo! Her portrayal of Paulie is so eclectic that at times her face takes on a different persona, like you are watching two actors play her part! Her highs bring you up and her lows makes your gut sink into despair with her! In one scene she is crying for the loss of her lover and the camera is close up on her face for almost a full two minutes which is eons on screen and its almost to much for the viewer to watch! At one point in her agony you think she might smash her face up against the screen! There is one intimate scene with Perabo and Jessica Pare who plays Tory that is done so well you really don't think of it as anything but two people in love! Mischa Barton and Pare are good but this is Perabo's ball game! The film is beautifully photographed with close ups and colors of the surrounding forest, and we have to thank the Director for the performances she brings out in these young actors! This is a film, a play, a painting, a book all rolled into one! But above all this, the one reason to see this film is the performance of Piper Perabo, I warn you, you will be exhausted at the end!

It is scary to discover that you were waiting for Juliet instead for Romeo in your life. And not everyone has the guts to live out this kind of love. I guess this happens more often than what we think. And for some it does have a Shakespearean ending to it.

The story is good, and the music is awesome. Some of the photography is really great. And it's a kick to see these actresses at such a young age and see what they turned into as young adults. I did like the movie, although you might want to skip it for a day that you are in a mood for serious drama and tragedy.

I get that people like the star-crossed lovers, tragic romance stuff- I do.  (In fact, I'm a HUGE fan of it.)  But this just seemed like watching a plain crash or a train wreck, because you know the ending's coming the whole time, and all you can do is watch the events (and one of the characters) unravel.  It's that horribly sad, gut-wrenching kind of melancholy that some folks really get off on; like watching movies about horrible tragedies, mass attrocities and dying things...  Some people like that.

Me however?  Not so much.

Don't get me wrong- I love the emotional quality and depth of this film, the cerebral characters and the intellectual nature of the production.  I greatly appreciate all of that.  I just think people have made way too much of watching a love (in 2 senses of the word) spiral downwards.  Plus, ya can't help but wish that somebody wouldda sat a certain little girlie down and gotten her some major therapy- sexuality notwithstanding.

I guess to me it seems they're trying to intimate that homosexuality must be akin to (or bundled inexorably with- if not  out-and-out lie within) some serious mental illness.  To that I say *zerbert.* :P

I was excited to find that the local video store was able to order it for me. The girl behind the counter actually knew what movie I was trying to describe.
The whole character of ""Mouse"" is exactly like that of every young teenager who gets thrown into this kind of situation, trying to help one friend, Paulie, ""win"" back another, Tory. The last half, after Paulie and Tory are discovered, was done wonderfully. The ending was extremely unexpected and actually made me cry at the loss of Tory's love.

It's at heart a tale about fitting in (or not) and the emotional toll of that. Something that every teenager has to come to terms with. And perhaps closeted gay teens more so than many others. This film captures the soaring romanticism of first love and the descent into craziness when it doesn't work out, when everything you wanted to believe about love is first shown to be an illusion--or worse, a fraud. The character of Paulie is riveting--she's a messy, damaged, romantic trainwreck. Tory is a heartbreaker who feels she's in a no-win situation and stumbles through it with unintended cruelty. And in her friendship with the two, the aptly-nicknamed Mouse finds a bit of herself. This is a film that's painted in big emotional brush-strokes that push the bounds of believability and yet somehow get the ardour and heartache of first love down pat.  My only wish is that more attention had been given to developing Mouse. In this story, she serves as observer/narrator, and with the exception of a few excellent scenes (one is when Mouse, Tory and Paulie receite the letters they wish they could write their mothers), she truly disappears into the woodwork. As it is, though, Mischa Barton's Mouse is a perfect observer: wide-eyed, smart, curious and extremely perceptive.

1650608,5,B00005QW9L,"While some would argue that this is a lesbian movie, I would say that this is simply a story of love.  We see a group of teenage girls in the all girls private schoool remotely tucked in somewhere on the east coast.  They are all sort of discards from their families.  Their parents have fulfilled the social contract of having children (or adopting them in some cases) and now that girls have reached a certain age, they are almost an inconvenience to their own parents.  Do not take me wrong,  they are not a problem kids - they are sent away so that their blended families can get some breathing space.  So this seemingly comfortable arrangement has one drawback.  These young women are craving for love and attention.  Tucked in school, away from families that care for them enough to pay hefty tuitiion, they bond by forming cliques or in some instances, strong loving relationships amongst each other.  Two of them fall in love and have sexual relationship that once discovered brings havoc around the entire school.  One of the grils (played by Piper Perabo) is sensitive, caring but unable to let go of her unfaithful lover who does not seem to want to resiprocate the love any longer.  It is in those tender moments of our heroine's distress that one can see that she fell in love with a person and the sex of the person is totally irrelevant to her. Our heroine is seeking love pure and unconditional the one that does not seek approval from the rest of the society. I totally loved this movie and I still keep wondering when I am going to see Piper Perabo in her next role.

The entire relationship unravelled instantly and I made an absolute fool of myself for the next six months trying to ""win"" her love. I was a neurotic wreck for two years afterwards not letting another woman get that close to me until I eventually met the woman that became my wife (and I thank God for her everyday!).

As a father of two daughters I realize that I can't control who they love,that's up to them. This movie has shown me not to be too judgmental about sexual issues. Like Paulie said - love just is.

There is a nude scene with the pretty and very-well-endowed Jessica Par to recommend it to guys, and the school has a bucolic setting. However, the best thing about the film for me are the sightings of some amazing American and Candian actresses early in their careers. Besides Piper Perabo (American) and Jessica Par (Canadian), the story's central character is played by a very young Mischa Barton -- already a willowy beauty.

One girl quotes Shakespeare to no apparent purpose, the other is consumed with anxiety about how others will view her sexuality. The conflict is tepid and the characters are wooden and two-dimensional. Their individual responses to their situation are incredible and unconvincing.

This movie is clumsy, predictable, grossly moralistic and has an infuriatingly insipid ending in which one of the main characters disavows her sexuality and the other offs herslf.

The comparison in another review to an after-school special is pretty accurate. The acting has its moments (Piper Perabo does her best considering what she has to work with), but the script/writing/dialogue is HORRID. Even if I found out a 13-year-old girl wrote it, I'd still be disappointed.

From pretentious qoutings of Shakespeare to the pointless obsession with a peregrine falcon (the lines about Perabo being ''the Raptor!'' are so bad you'll cringe), this movie is one long argument for using the mute button. The ''sex'' scene will please some teenage softcore/cinemax fans (I'm guessing), but then there's the obligatory ''lilting lesbian love song'' in the background. There's also the equally predictable Ani ''did I mention I do it with girls?'' Difranco ballad as backing for the ''devastating break-up''. It's hard to tell if Perabo is crying for lost love in that scene or bored to tears by the script.

1650670,5,B00005QW9L,"Lost and Delirious initially appears to be a simple coming of age story but is also an in-depth study of relationships and of the effects people have on each other.  The story is told from the perspective of Mary, who upon arriving at boarding school, learns that her two roommates, Tori and Paulie, are lovers.  The girls become friends, and it becomes apparent that all three of them have significant family issues.  Mary had a loving mother but has now been sent to boarding school by her distant and unloving father and stepmother after her mother's death two years before.  Paulie is adopted and apparently has never felt loved or accepted by her adoptive family.  Tori comes from a family which is loving and affectionate, but her parents' love is conditional and does not give her the freedom to be herself.  At one point, Tori admits that she is ""addicted"" to her mother despite the problems in their relationship.  Even then, it is apparent that Paulie doesn't feel that way about anyone but Tori.  When she and Paulie are caught in bed together by Tori's younger sister, Tori immediately ends the relationship and denies that it ever existed in order to avoid her family's rejection.  Tori goes back to her 'real' life but Paulie has no such life to go back to.  Paulie does not have family support or even other close friends.  When she does attempt to reach out to her biological mother, she learns that her mother does not desire contact with her.  Paulie is the most gripping character in this movie, but it is also easy to sympathize with Tori, who feels that she is doing what she has to do in order to avoid losing her family forever.  The movie does a good job of simultaneously presenting both perspectives.  Paulie is unwilling or unable to accept the fact that she has lost Tori, and she becomes more and more despondent as her desperate attempts to win Tori back are repeatedly met with failure.  Finally, she is pushed over the edge when she realizes that there is nothing she can do to win Tori back.  At the end of the movie, Mary realizes that the reason she did not completely lose herself in Paulie's desperation was that her mother's love was, ultimately, enough to help her realize that she was lovable and that life was worthwhile.  Paulie, who had never been loved unconditionally by anyone but Tori, was unable to reestablish any sense of wholeness or well being after losing her.

This was beautifully rendered love story.  Although the plot was not necessarily realistic, the characters were.  I could relate to all of them.  I was drawn in by this story and could identify with Paulie's inability to give up the only relationship in which she was appreciated and loved just for being herself.  This movie raises some interesting questions about the role of love in our lives, what happens when we do not get unconditional love from our parents, and what our responsibilities are to others when we begin and end relationships.",1154822400,6,2961,4.6976744186046515
1650671,4,B00005QW9L,"Lost and delirious is the joking phrase that one of the protagonists uses to describe life in a Canadian girls' boarding school, and the description becomes all too true as the story unfolds.  While the script itself is only a B+ effort, the direction and acting is A++ with a strong cast all the way down to minor supporting characters.  Above all, Piper Perabo steals the movie as Paulie, carrying off a difficult role with facility and conviction.

This is a movie about love and the loss of love, centering around a triumvirate comprising one new girl and two who have been at the school for some extended time.  All three girls are to differing degrees adrift emotionally, lacking the firm anchor of unconditional love that parents are supposed to provide.  Another joking phrase, ""the lost girls"" comes to describe Paulie perfectly as she descends into despair after being rejected by the only love-object she has ever known in her life: her friend and lover Tori.  Lacking the emotional safety-net of a family or even other close friends, Pauli is devastated when Tori abandons their relationship in order to protect her public image as a good little bourgeois father's girl.  The delicate balancing-act of the movie is to allow us to feel the full force of Paulie's emotional collapse while also understanding - if not entirely sympathizing with - the motives that drive Tori as she repudiates her one true love in order to save her own future.

Although the lovers are both female, this is not a lesbian movie (whatever that means).  Although there are a couple of love scenes, this is not a soft-porn movie.  Although Paulie is cruelly isolated by the nervous homophobia of many of the other schoolgirls, this is not a movie about sexual politics.  Transiently fashionable notions of ""correctness"" fortunately have no place in this movie, which is about personal feelings.  Love, loyalty, desperation, fear, embarrassment, weakness all play their parts and we follow with foreboding and infinite sympathy Paulie's descent into total despair.  In order to appreciate a movie like this, it is probably necessary to have lived, loved, and lost, and to have thought deeply about the experience(s) afterwards.  So this is not an easy movie to watch, but for the emotionally mature viewer it is poignant and ultimately deeply moving, and represents a triumph of directing and acting quite absent from the vast majority of insipid confections that pass for ""great movies"" in North America.",1152835200,8,2492,4.98792270531401
1650672,5,B00005QW9L,"I bought this movie without ever seeing it.  As I started to watch it I got caught up in the story line, this movie is a beautiful story about first love and true love.  The actors, script and overall feel of the movie are amazing.  The two main characters Tori and Paulie do such a wonderful job that it is hard to remember that it is only a movie and that they are not truly in love.  But if you are looking for a movie with a happy ending this is not one to see.  I of course had no idea what the movie was about and when I got to the end I was very upset about the ending.  This movie is a amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",1152057600,2,644,3.8045112781954886
1650673,4,B00005QW9L,"Being a straight guy, I can't really appreciate this from the viewpoint of a woman or a gay person, the two kinds of people that this movie tries to empower. But I have been the victim of unrequited love, having fallen for a girl who, ironically enough, left me for another girl (go figure).

So, whether I should sympathize with her situation or not, I still felt for Piper Perabo's character, Paulie, as she was denied her true love, merely because Tori was scared to admit what she was. It was unfair, a loss based entirely on outside circumstance (that being a conservative family that wouldn't understand); and of course, it all had to end in tragedy (that much was alluded to from the movie's midpoint onwards, with an overabundance of Shakespearean quotes and artsy symbolism).

While I did genuinely feel for Paulie, and I think that was the writer's intention, some of the girl's actions and dialogue just made you think that she'd gone over the edge (no pun intended, to those who've seen it). At the end, she starts sword-training, and referring to herself as The Raptor. She cuts her roommate Mary (played by pre-OC Mischa Barton) with a shard of glass, then cuts herself, and presses their wounds together, saying ""now our blood runs together."" Coo-coo.

Plus, there are a handful of loose-ends left after the somewhat-abrupt ending, and the whole thing has a really high-school poetry narration, in terms of birds and folklore, and such.

That said, even with the ever-present loom of melodrama, all the actors played believable roles, which is why I could be so enthralled with the film, in spite of it's low-budget and over-the-top emo-tangents.

Above just being a good movie, it also made me realize something: all love's the same. Girls can love girls as much as guys can love girls, or guys can love guys (eww, though). So, in the end, I understand and appreciate the ideal. I'm still mad at my ex, though.",1146441600,8,1926,4.754491017964072

Piper Perabo's acting performance is brilliant, as is the rest of the cast.

Tori cuts all ties with Paulie, and Mary's new role is trying to keep Paulie from doing anything too destructive.  After the relationship between Tori and Paulie ended, the movie really took a turn for the worse.  I found it to be very slow and much too dramatic.

The story revolves around the three main charaters victoria moller ""tory"" (jessica pare) paulie oster (piper perabo) and mary bedford ""mouse"" (mischa barton). As the story unfolds paulie and tory take mouse under their wing and the three become fast friends and mary soon discovers that her two new friends are more than just friends they are  lovers deeply in love with each other and she accepts their relationship without any question, however nothing lasts forever and the happiness and bliss that they have is soon shattered when victoria's younger sister allison (emily vancamp) discovers the two girls in bed together and this is when things take a drastic turn as victoria out of fear of being rejected by her family and peers breaks off her relationship with paulie and decides to play it straight in order to drown any rumors that she is a lesbian and also gets a boyfriend at a near by boys school named jake. Paulie being deeply emotional and deeply in love cannot let go and is devastated by tory's rejection and does everything she can to win tory back. The story is very sad because it takes you into the mindset of a young woman torn apart inside because she has not just lost her lover but also the only person who has ever loved her in return, being given up for adoption by her birth mother and the fact that she has never connected with her adopted family paulie had an almost desperate need to be loved and she thought that she found that in victoria but with the loss of victoria and also the rejection from her own biological mother brings paulie into an emotional breakdown. Because it's almost as if there is no safety net or no wall to save her from her own self destruction and you can actually feel paulie's heartbreak and desperation in the situation and i think that what the film's real message is that it shows how society can influence others (victoria) not to be true to themselves and also judge others (paulie) just because they don't follow the norm and because they love outside of societies rules but also it shows how we all could love if there were no rules.

Having glanced through some of the reviews already in place, I can only come to the conclusion that some of the negative ones were probably written by teenage boys hoping for some kind of teen-lesbo-fest.  They came to the wrong place!

Lost & Delirious isn't focused on lesbianism, or even teenage sex - it's focused on the power that there is in relationships to build up and tear down the fragile foundations of emotional stability.

Lost & Delirious covers a wide variety of subjects throughout its course; first love, forbidden relationships, social stigma, peer pressure, rejection and ultimately the importance of being true to yourself.

Although the obvious focus of the film is on the breakdown of a relationship and the events that unfold from that, the underlying message for me is about the importance of family life.  The three main characters in this film are all victims of failed parenting - a fundamental cracking of their emotional foundations which ultimately precipitates the downward spiral and the tragic conclusion of the film.

It's strange that even though you can pretty much see where the film is headed from fairly early on, it's no less poignant when it gets there.

The performances from all three girls is excellent, but Piper Perabo absolutely steals the show.  She gives an utterly heart-wrenching performance throughout and manages something which many of these types of film fail to do...  Most films depicting teenage angst quickly get me to the point of yelling 'get over yourself' at the screen, but Perabo somehow manages to take you with her throughout the whole piece, even when she is starting to lose her grip and descend into despair.  Up to the very last moment my urge was to want to reach in and save her from the inevitable ending.

Sadly, I expect the sensitive subject matter or 'teen lesbian' monicker will put a lot of people off this movie.  And it really is a shame because I found it profoundly moving.  Like the first time I watched 'Beaches' or the above-mentioned 'Dead Poets Society', I suspect this movie will never leave me...",1133222400,11,2226,4.823684210526316

1650723,1,B00005QW9L,"Oh my God, where to begin with this tragic obliteration of film-making + storytelling. First of all, I want to go on record by saying that any individuals that actually thought this film was good in any way are definately lost + delirious themselves. These people are obviously mislead, unfortunate viewers who are most likely lesbians themselves, and wouldn't know a good film if it fell off of a hundred story buiding, then landed right on top of them. Nobody who's in a right state of mind, and has good taste in films would ever consider giving this movie a single positive thought. That being said, I'll get straight to the point. Okay, this film was so bad, so unbelievably terrible it actually accomplished what I once thought impossible. It made Batman + Robin look like a good film. The story told was meaningless, and you don't have to be a lesbian to appreciate this film. The acting was non-existent. A pathetic attempt by both actress, director + especially writer at telling a story that is embarassingly displayed in the biggest waste of 2 hours I have ever seen. I had to laugh to myself every 5 minutes watching these dumb girls try to convince myself + others that what they're doing is real, and worthy of anyone's attention. As irrelevant as it may seem, the music was also completely, annoyingly stupid. I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone who hasn't yet witnessed the horror that is Lost + Delirious. But, it doesn't matter anyway. Really. These idiots are watching a bird fly away as if it's more interesting to them then the splattered, bloody remains of the main caracter that lies before them on the sidewalk. ""Oh, how terrible, she just killed herself right in front of us. But, look everyone, nevermind that, there's a pretty birdie flying away!"" Need I say more? I think not. In Hollywood's lengthly history there have been truck-loads + truck-loads of films that have been complete, utter crap, but this one.....well, let's just say there aren't enough trucks in the world. In the end, I highly recommend to anyone who values good movies, and the time that is short + precious in your lives, DO NOT see this movie, unless you're looking for something to laugh at, not with. Do not put money into these losers pockets. I think it's sad that there are imbecilic people that actually green-light projects such as these, polluting video store shelves.

You'll wince and remember your own experiences. This is less a film about hormones and homosexuality, far more about teen angst, friendship and betrayal.

Of course, I can't speak for them myself, but I can imagine how it must have been, how it still is sometimes. Any films made during those years would have only reinforced horrific, negative stereotypes about lesbians (think ""The Children's Hour"" without the surprising tinge of sympathy).

  ""Lost and Delirious"" is certainly not the first film of the 21st century to come along and portray same gender love in a less than monstrous light, but is one of the most easily accessible and less preachy ones. It could be about anyone who has ever been a misfit and fallen in love against everyone else's wishes.

  Different people will bring their own history to this tale, but for many it is all too realistic. Even if you gently push the love story aspects aside, the portrayal of life in an all-girls' school is so accurate it almost hurts to watch. It's a sad part of life that many girls are cruel to each other during the teen years, but throw in the fact that two classmates who happen to be of the same sex fall in love with each other and suddenly hearts are being thrown in the meshing machine.

  I swore I wouldn't cry while I watched this, I swore, but Piper Perabo is just too good and too convincing as a young woman torn apart inside by her own feelings. Her vulnerability and the way her classmates (most of all the girl she loves) treat her lead to an intense breaking point that would leave the coldest person in the world in tears.

It's impossible to have any kind of emotional grasp on the characters or the film since the movie primarily consists of empty cliches and tired lines and acting. The emotions that the actors do try to project come across as phony and unrealistic and take place in an incredibly bad story line. Even the brief love scenes were hollow and not worth a watch.

The two lead performances of Piper Perabo and Jessica Pare has really mesmerised me totally. In the beginning before these two characters of Paulie and Tori are discovered, it is really beautiful to watch these two in love, and just going along there business until all hell breaks loose. The emotion, connection and love these two feel and share feels so real and honest.

And the love scene between the two is very tender and real.

Once they are revealed and Paulie's world begins to fall apart is so hard to watch at times, because I SO desperatly want  Paulie and Tori to figure it all out and be together as it once was.

Like I've said this film has and always will leave a lasting impression on me, at times it's hard to get scenes of it out of my head. The raw emotion of Paulie so so excellently played by Piper Perabo, I've seen who I now consider from this performances, one of the most talentled actress' around. I hope she has a long lasting career.

Jessica Pare, I am amazed at too. Her performance of being torn for her true love for Paulie but desperatly not wanting the world and her parents to know her real feelings.

 This is what is heartbreaking to watch, Tori pretending to be what her parents/family,society think/believe how she should be. ie. A hetrosexual girl, so she starts to date a boy that is interested in her, and this also contributes to Paulies melt down. This is when the film can be haunting, especially if you are so into the story and these two characters.

Also let's not forget Mischa Barton. Mischa gives a well done performance as there witness througout the film.

I absolutely recommend this movie for a number of reasons. One it isn't some dyke movie, this shows a natural, beautiful, honest look at two girls in love and the tragedy  I believe at what happens when they are found out and how one partner can clam up and not reveal how they really feel for fear of what their parents and everybody will think about them, and the destruction one will go through, cause they are so in love that it is  killing them.

Take a touch of Shakespeare, a dash of drama, and the passion of first loves, and you'll have ""Lost and Delirious,"" the stunning  film by Canadian filmmaker, L&eacute;a Pool. Based on the novel, ""The Wives of Bath"" by Susan Swan, the film follows the lives of three very different boarding school roommates: shy and unassuming Mary ""Mouse"" Bradford (Mischa Barton, The Sixth Sense, TV's The O.C.), the striking and rakish rebel, Paulie (Piper Perabo, Coyote Ugly), and beautiful, but privileged Tory (Jessica Par&eacute;).

Leaving behind a life filled with sadness since the death of her mother, Mouse is quickly embraced by her new roommates and discovers a sense of belonging for the first time in her life. Dubbed one of the ""lost girls"" by Paulie, she is mesmerized by Paulie's bold and rebellious nature. She also finds her roommates to be more than friends, as Paulie and Tory's late-night rendezvous and moments of whispered passion become part of her daily existence.

Alas, nothing is forever, and the newfound peace Mouse has come to enjoy is soon shattered when Tory and Paulie are discovered, their relationship exposed. Faced with the possibility of her family finding out, Tory panics and abruptly ends the relationship, going to the extreme of fabricating lies and embracing a relationship with a boy from a neighboring school. All the while, Tory professes to Paulie she will never love anyone like she loves her, but it's time they ""grew out of it.""

Tory's betrayal is nothing short of devastating to Paulie, who loves with all her heart and sees Tory as the only person who has ever loved her. Abandoned by her birth mother, Paulie had an almost desperate need to be loved and she found that in Tory. Faced with the loss of their love, she embarks on a mission to get her back and enlists Mouse as her partner in crime.

Torn between the two, Mouse is overwhelmed. Her attempts to console Paulie are shunned after she tells Paulie that Tory's simply not a lesbian. ""Lesbian?"" Paulie responds, outraged. ""Are you f***ing kidding me? You think I'm a lesbian?! I am Paulie in love with Tory..."" At first glance, some lesbians may find that sort of response disturbing in a lesbian film. But if you reflect for a moment, you see the brilliance of L&eacute;a Pool's vision with that statement. For Paulie, she simply loves Tory. Period. End of story. It's not about being a lesbian and all the trappings of the word. It is simply about love from the heart. What Pool does is make you look beyond labels, beyond societal mandates, beyond the guilt placed on those who love outside society's approval, and allows you to see love in its purest form. She lets you see how we all could love if there were no rules.

The character of Paulie is simply fantastic! Reminiscent of Angelina Jolie during her Oscar-winning portrayal of the sociopath, Lisa, in ""Girl, Interrupted,"" Perabo's performance is stunning as she embodies Paulie's eroding mental instability. For Paulie, life is all or nothing. ""Love is...it just is...,"" she says, and if you don't have it, you have nothing. Although young love is typically cast as desperate and angst-ridden, you actually feel Paulie's heartbreak and desperation over the loss of the only person who has ever loved her. The rollercoaster of Paulie's emotions increase when, after making love for the last time, Tory tells her that she will never love anyone as she does Paulie, kisses her, then leaves. Paulie's fragile state of mind is simply shattered after that and the consequences of her ensuing actions bring about an ending of Shakespearean proportion.

The supporting cast is not to be forgotten. Jackie Burroughs as caring head mistress, Ms. Vaughn, and Mimi Kuzyk as tough professor, Ms. Bannet, are superb in their roles. Vaughn casts the sympathetic role, attempting to help Paulie as she spirals out of control, while Bannet plays the tough, but caring, partner who sees danger ahead. Although their relationship is never defined, it is questioned by the girls and often the topic of speculation. Graham Greene shines in his role as the school's gardener, and newfound friend and confidant, of Mouse. Insights into Mouse's life and her growing concern for what's happening and Paulie's deteriorating condition are played out during her moments with Greene in the most delightful manner.

Brilliant directing, superb acting, and love's ultimate sacrifice - this film has it all. ""Lost and Delirious"" is a timeless tale about mad, passionate love that crosses all boundaries, and the tragic consequences we sometimes face when that love goes awry. It is truly destined to be a classic.",1107993600,159,4766,4.925280199252802

Plot: we have three boarding school roommates. One of them has recently just arrived at school(Barton). She soon discovers that her two new friends have a fondness for one another that involves much more than sharing clothes and late night girl talk - well, there is something happening late at night but it's not exactly girl-talk.

I would have rated this film higher if not for these scenes. I've grown weary of sex-scenes that could just as easily been cut out. If you disagree, ask yourself why you enjoy those scenes.

It's clear that all three girls have deep reasons for doing what they do in this film, and it all stems from a disconnected relationship with their mothers. They find reason and harmony in each other. This is the part of the film I believed spoke truer than any other.",1105660800,3,1217,4.699530516431925

Add together an overdose of teen angst with some overdone dark symbolism and you wind up with this film.

1650833,5,B00005QW9L,"This is a French-Canadian co-production, meant for TV.
It's not a large-budget, Holliwood-like superproduction and I think it's important to keep this in mind as the pretentions of this production are dimensioned to the budget. And so ought to be our expectations.
What does that mean? It simply means that in a superproduction, the spectator is entitled to expect that nothing in the movie will remind him or her that he or she is actually watching a movie and not some real-life event. This is not always the case here.
But hey guys, what do you want. Again, it was meant fo TV. And this is also where I found it extraordinary.
In this story we find three adolescent girls sharing a room in a boarding school in Canada. Even though the heart of the situation is a homosexual relationship between two of the three roommates, the movie is not about homosexuality, as Andie from Tennessee beautifully wrote. The important message I got was about the clash of social rules (on one side) and emotional being (on the other). It seems that in order to cope with social life we have to crush our emotions and so give up who we truly are. Adolescence is when this usually happens, and unfortunately also is when we are less prepared.
It's surely not the first time a movie tackles this problem, but in spite of this our society continues to impose its harsh rules. The movie has a beautiful way of remind this to us. It will also remind those of us who are parents of the difficulties our children may be living.
In spite of the 'imperfections', I enjoyed it a lot. I remembered how growing through adolescence was difficult for me and so I was quite involved emotionally.
So to conclude I found it far more enjoyable and meaningful than the average daredevil (just an example). Here's another example of how marketing can bring exaggerated success, when a worthwhile movie may stay in the shadow. And honestly the price of the DVD is more than reasonable, so I wouldn't even think about 'renting' the movie before deciding whether to buy it (how can someone even think about suggesting this, I don't know).

1650834,5,B00005QW9L,"This is an exetremely interesting look at the lives of three girls in a boarding school somewhere in the US. Mary 'Mouse' Bradford (Mischa Barton) is a 15 year old girl who has just been sent to a boarding school by her father. On arrival she is introduced to Tori (Jessica Pare) a fellow student at the school, she is told she is rooming with Tori and another student called Paulie (Perabo). Tori and Paulie take Mouse under their wing and she becomes quite good friends with. After a few nights of rooming with the girls she discovers the real nature of their relationship, they're lovers. Tori and Paulie share a loving relationship until one day they're caught in a compromising situation by Tori's sister. Paulie see's this as no big deal ""F*ck it, its the 21st century"" but Tori completely freaks out. She's worried as she explains her parents are super straight and religious and would never talk to her again. Unable to handle the pressure she breaks it off with Paulie, much to Paulie's dismay. The rest of the movie Paulie spends trying to win back her love, with an interesting and shocking ending. The director does an excellent job developing all the replationships between the characters, very well written. The acting is also very high above average, all of the main characters are portrayed very believeably, with the absolute stand out performance from Piper Perabo, she is utterly amazing, she is able to portray every single one of Paulies emotions brilliantly and she captivates the audience, making them feel for her, defiently one of the best performances ive seen in a long time.

1650835,5,B00005QW9L,"This is a powerful film. Unfortunately, a lot of people have mistakenly reduced this film to a social commentary about the intolerance of homosexuality in today's society. The film is about being lost, NOT gay. The homosexual element simply provides the perfect situation to better comunicate the film's many profound messages. NONE of which messages have anything to say about homosexuality. So please spare me the ""It's so hard to be gay"" sermon. You're missing the point of the movie.

 Paulie and Tori are "" just like the Lost Boys in Peter Pan- only girls"". Tori is lost inside the mask she wears. Unable to publicly admit to the love she feels for Paulie, she rejects both Paulie and herself for the shallow acceptance of her family and friends. Quite the opposite,the passionate, impulsive Paulie is very open about who she is and what she feels, but is nonetheless lost in her idealism. Just like she spent an entire day in the arms of her true mom before she was adopted by her ""fake"" mom, Paulie was in a relationship of true love, but is forced away by a world that puts more emphasis on the norm rather than authenticity. Fakeness and Paulie mix like oil and water. Mary is the only character wo is not ""lost"". She understands the unimportance of what people think and stands by Paulie during her downward spiral much like she did with her mother during her illness.

 Perabo's acting is incredible. My only complaint is that it gets kind of boring watching attempt after attempt after freaking attempt by Paulie to win back Tori. All in all, though, this is an amazing film about the power of love and how it can both save and destroy.

But when Tori's sister storms into the room with her friends and finds the two of them in bed together, Tori breaks off the relationship with Paulie.  Tori fears that her sister will tell her parents and she'll be disowned.  She couldn't take the risk of ruining her family's reputation at the prep school.  Paulie, devastated, loses her sanity and tries to get her lover back.  Tori avoids her at all cost playing it straight.  Paulie goes further into descent and Tori hides behind the mask.
Both girls are tragic because they fear being alone and abandoned.  Tori, while playing it straight, sees that her former lover is falling apart, and stands by allowing it to happen.  Paulie, in addition to her partner ending their relationship, finds that her real mother doesn't want to be found.

It is truly one of the most painful (but beautiful) films I have ever watched (besides 'Savior' - another truly wonderful but hard film); whilst being both beautiful - and magnificent, it is also a true depiction of the bitter darkness and ugliness of betrayal - which would unbalance all but the most well-grounded of characters (one of the main points of the film).  What can I add to the other reviewers? other than that Perabo plays Paulie to perfection.  Young love is painful and euphoric enough without the burning twisting of betrayal in one's guts and heart in front of the whole world.  Only the most cynical of viewers could fail to be moved by this film.  The metaphor of the hawk is a nice touch - the symbolism of freedom and spirituality is something we should all be able to relate to.

1650915,4,B00005QW9L,"I like to review the film, and then the DVD:
Film: The first time I viewed this movie, I did not enjoy it. I had read several comments about the nature of the lesbian relationship being ""true love,"" and about this film representing a ""beautiful love story."" I disagree with these statements. This film is much more about the pain of adolescence, and how different teenagers deal with that pain. The relationship in this discussion is between Paulie and Tori. Paulie is a teenager in need of serious help, on the verge of breakdown. Whether or not Paulie is a lesbian is not of relevance -- gay or straight, her love of Tori is unhealthy. Tori, although much more stable, has her own problems (including an inability to be herself with her family). The narrator, Mouse, is forced to watch the pain that these characters go through.
The acting is fantastic, but I gave this film only 4 stars due to a few factors. I felt that the script, and thus the film, lagged in places. I was also not quite as interested in Mouse's family problems. They were pushed into the background so much that they may as well have been removed, saving some time and helping the pace of the film.

Few movies captivate a true love story revolving homosexuality and I applaud Lea Pool for doing so with much success. This movie reminds me of a Shakespeare poem, so carefully written and so beautifully recited. Piper Perabo definitly struck a cord with me for her powerful performance as the heartbroken girl who turns dark and falls into her own surreal world of delirious fake emotions. A beautifully made movie, this should've got more attention than it did. I love how Lea represented Piper's isolation by a trapped eagle that Piper is teaching how to fly, ""You will fly away from here."" Piper longs for that eagle to be her, hoping she can flutter easily and softly from the heavy world around her. This is one of the few movies that made me cry, actually cry because of the emotional depths that it reached. This is a true gem in filmmaking and the acting couldn't have been any better by Piper. The movie thinks and feels her character revolving around landmines of depression where a way out seems almost impossible. I applaud Lea Pool for finally making a movie about teen homosexuality and not making it something to laugh at. The image of homosexuality now is becoming grossly missunderstood. Especially to young minds who listen to these harsh words from Eminem about homosexuality being wrong.

The story is related in an on again, off again fashion through the eyes of Mary B (Mischa Barton), though half the time it is presented independently of this character.  While some could argue that there should be more consistency with this, I did not find the inconsistency particularly disturbing.
  These are the passions of young (though not necessarily or unavoidably teen) first true love.  I have been a Paulie, and my Tory was a Serada, who cast me off with the same indifference.  Being in my twenties at the time, I knew that such depth of emotion and such passion was in no wise confined to teen years.  For many who watch this movie, it will be a retelling of agonizing first love, whether gay or straight, told from the depths of the heart where places remain unhealed through lifetimes.

It is the story of a girls emotions being turned and twisted leading to the fall of her breakdown..  Pauli and Tori are roommates in a all girls boarding school and their together..  This is where you go ""How typical"".. but its not..  What its about is 2 people in love with eachother and they get busted in bed together by ones disgustingly bratty homophobe little sister and Tori tells paulie that they can only be friends.  you get the impression that they have been together for a long time and tori wants paulie to just walk away.  Right off Tori gets a boyfriend who she has sex with right in front of paulie
then the whole time she is calling paulie a rapist and without any present regret tears paulies life to peices and makes her the laughing stock of the school.  Paulie, as anyone would in this position, falls into a breakdown with noone to turn to but her young naive other roommate mouse..  well, theres only so much mouse can do i mean shes very young and hasn't experienced much life.  You spend the movie wondering when the movie is going to shatter because its narrated and so paulie is always a ""was"" character.  In short.  During the telling of the story paulie has died.  It leads to her finals measures and paulies suicide.
It also brings you through a whirl wind as you despise Tori.  By the end your wishing she hadda thrown that little *... off the buidling before she jumped..  (pardon my frankness)
its a hard movie to watch and awkwardly enough the first time i ever saw it i saw it on tv with my mother.  HA! now that was fun..
its a deep story, its very disturbing though, i will warn you, there are times you are going to have to walk away from the tv and take a break..",1046131200,5,1812,4.3067846607669615

This movie however blew me away, not only because Piper Perabo gave the performance of her life but because it showed the intensity on how hectic love could be, no matter what the sexuality. Ever since the movie broadcastI have become Pipers number 1 fan and im sure u will be too.

1650992,3,B00005QW9L,"I'm surprised to see all the enthusiastic reviews for this movie, as I found it both beautiful and disappointing.  All three leads are excellent, and the love between Tori and Pauli is palatable and convincing.  The story has enormous possibilities: lost love and a friendship triangle in the setting of a girl's boarding school.  But on a number of points it fails to deliver.
The first is our narrator.  Mouse's monologues, a combination of naval gazing naivete and self-pity, slow the movie to a crawl everytime she appears on screen.  We are supposed to see the lovers through her eyes, but Mouse is such a wan icicle that her presence simply creates an emotional distance between the love story and the audience.  I could not help feeling that the story would have been more interesting told through from the perspective of one of the lovers themselves.
The second is the turn in the plot where Tori and Pauli's relationship is discovered, a plot twist better suited to a 1960s setting than the year 2000.  Tori's reaction and subsequent actions are hard to swallow (if she was so concerned, why did she make out with Pauli on their roof for anyone to see, anyway?). Pauli's denial that the two are gay also seems dated.  (You can't help but wonder what bubble these girls have been living in, to have missed the last 30 years of gay liberation.  Frankly, girls elite schools have been hotbeds of out, politically active, teenage lesbians for the last 10 years, at least.)  The end is similarly disappointing, hinting that adopted children are so emotionally fragile, one bad relationship will send them to the other edge of sanity.
The positives for this film are the strong performances by the two female leads and some beautiful love scenes.  Probably worth seeing for those two factors alone.",1044144000,5,1801,4.814935064935065

When I first rented this movie at the local Blockbuster, I was debating to myself whether or not renting this movie was a great idea or just a waste of money. When I started the movie, I was  thrown into a world of confusion and sadness when I met ""Mouse"" played by Mischa Barton, who was on her way to the Perkins Girls College. I immediately developed an understanding of Mouse's shy, insecure personality when she was reflecting on the image of her dead mother. I was later greeted with Victoria -played by Jessica Pare, and Pauline - who was brilliantly played by Piper Perabo. Tori and ""P"", Mouse found out, were lovers who had an incredible bond toward one another. Unfortunately the two lovers were doomed because of the ever present homophobia that existed in Tori's parents, and her disgusting little sister. Watching Pauly pledge her undying love to Tory, and watching Tory reject her over and over again, made me feel like my heart was being ripped from my body. I have never felt such an incredible bond to a movie's characters, and I have never felt so sad and crushed about a movie's ending. This movie will leave you weeping, but it will also leave you with a better understanding of true love, how beautiful it is, and how easily it can be hidden by fear.",1043625600,18,1350,4.532786885245901

If your older than 25 (like me) and remember when all in life seemed wildly active, all was achievable and certainly nothing too far out of reach. It's a part of your past, but not forgotten.  People who gave this a negative review forgot they once felt this way.
People who liked the movie remembered this moment in life or are young enough today to feel this sprit to be alive and kicking. The visual effects equaled the need to feel anything is possible.

Paulie is a very intense character, whose emotions always seem genuine.

1651084,5,B00005QW9L,"I can't believe how many negative reviews there are about this movie.  I do admit the movie has very little to do with the book.  Actually both are extremely different.  So if you have read The Wives of Bath and expect the movie to reflect the book, you will be disappointed.  However this is by far the BEST movie I have ever seen.  It is one of those movies that stays with you, it can consume you if you allow it to. There are so more many themes represented in this movie than the obivoius, a girl in love with a girl.  The most overlooked theme is the main theme: how a mother's unconditional love affects a daughter.  Other themes include: passion, fear, obsession, stereotypes, finding identity, defiance, loyalty, rejection, and vunerability.  Its about how far a human will go for love.  If you like drama and are a fan of shakespearian movies, then you will love this movie.  The acting was the most incredible I've ever seen.  Piper Perablo is awesome.  She can go from a quite soft whisper to a bold loud character on the brink of sanity with minitues in this movie.  The ending is predictable, and movie wouldn't have been half as good without it.  Although it is sad, it is the only way the movie could have ended.  Paulie had to break the mold, you see, she couldn't become Miss Vaughn.  Miss Vaughn (the headmistress) represents Paulie's fate, and Paulie just can't except that.  Paulie doesn't go insane at the end, she just goes to far in love, and that is what this movie is about: love, passion, and going to far in love and how it can affect two lovers. This movie touched me on so many emotional levels.  Anyone who loves a woman should see this movie.  The movies takes away the ""girl/girl relationship taboo.""  It is def. not a lesbian flick, it's a movie about love, and supports the notion that it doesn't matter what the gender is of the person you love...be who you are, and never compromise that, even if it takes everything away from you.  It is a movie for those that can appreciate a good independent film, not those who are into the run of the mill mainstream movies.

1651086,2,B00005QW9L,"This is a film with a lofty aim, and its cause is worth as that of ""Boy's Don't Cry.""  And things that would make a good film are certainly there.  But for all those facts, I cannot help feeling that this is a missed opportunity, and the following is the reason.
""Lost and Delirious"" concerns a girl Pauline in a boarding school falling in love with her roommate Victoria, and newly arrived roommate Mary aka ""Mouse"" who becomes a mutual friend of them.  Pauline and Victoria keeps on the relations until one morning Victoria's sister finds them naked in bed.  Vitoria, afraid of losing the esteem of her parents, leaves Paulie to her utter dismay.  Enraged, passionate, Pauline still clings to her lost love, and comes an inevitable ending.
The film cleverly avoids the stereotyped images of conservative teachers who do not approve of lesbiamism.  In fact, they are always understanding, and the headmaster really cares the students.  So, when Pauline sneaks a bottle of gin, and plays a song of rock'n'roll loudly on the cassette deck, the teachers don't get upset; they too enjoy the good time, dancing to the tune.  Interestingly, however, though the story is set in today, it sometimes looks as if not, maybe because of the good production design of the old-fashioned boarding school, and well-written characters.  So far, the film is very good and unique, and this may reflect the expreiences of the director Lea Pool, who was once a teacher herself.
This film is said to be based on a novel which I haven't read, and it is palpable that the material itself has considerable potential.  But the film fails to transfer the power to the screen even though the cast, especially Piper Perabo, does her best.  Perhaps, it is the director that didn't know what to do with the topic, which could have been done better.
But what is wrong?  Perabo does a good job, but sometimes her acting as a troubled girl seems (just seems) overacting.  Let me hurriedly add that to what extent she is responsible, I don't know.  I can say that though ""Coyote Ugly"" was not a big hit, and critically bashed, in that she is very natural, and I loved that.  Here, she is not.  Think of the scene when Pauline kneels down before now estranged Victoria in a library, and quotes lines of Shakespeare (with unnecessary sound effect of a squealing hawk).  Or, see how angry and lonely Paulie starts to rave in a cafeteria, when the camera pulls back in a flash, and suddenly moves in slow motion, showing MTV like techiniques.  Everytime this heavy-handed direction appears on the screen, her natural charm vanishes, and the film gives away that she is acting, which itself, however, is all right.
And ... casting, which should be considered more carefully.  About Piper Perabo, she was from the first in a disadvantageous position because ""Coyote Ugly"" is a story about a bar, where, of course, no minor can be admitted, and then, she appears in this  film about a boarding school for teenage girls.  Moreover, at the time of shooting the film, she was 23 years old -- that is not a big problem if you didn't know co-starring Mischa Barton as Mouse was only 14.  (You may remember that Barton was in ""The Sixth Sense"" as a little girl under the table with a video casette.)  I don't care their ages; I just want to say that their previous career can sometimes affect our viewing, and they should take care of the importance of casting more.
But perhaps if I didn't like the final result of the film, it is because of the director's way of putting too allegorical factors
into the film.  There is one about a wounded hawk; there's one about fencing; there's also about Shakespeare, but frankly, I don't think the film need them all.  And Barton, who usually gives acting full of nuance, only stares and narrates the events around her, which is very disappointing, and pointless, considering why in the world she ""Mouse"" is here.  About Jessica Pare the same thing can be said; why Paulie is so atracted to her, is not, I am afraid, fully materialized on the screen.
This Canadian film received good reviews at Sundance Film Festival, and I can understand that.  I don't say it is bad; however, we have seen much better films like ""Show Me Love.""  Or in the vein of comedy, how about ""But I'm a Cheerleader""?  If I may be allowed to extend the topic from lesbianism to honosexuality, we get also delightful ""Get Real"" and many others.  ""Lost and Delirious"" deserves much mention and audience, but what it needs is another skillful hand to direct it.",1028073600,11,4526,4.663727959697733

Joe: ""It depends on how much they're paying you, I guess?...How much are they paying you?""
Lea Pool's decadent tale of a love unlike any other is a humorous, passionate, and tragic statement on image and the lengths one will go to in order to uphold a facade created out of fear. The language is real, interesting, and sharp. The acting is superb. Piper Perabo is truly a force to be reckoned with as the desperate Pauline. The woman mesmerized me. This was a role with substance, unlike the frat-boy fodder that was ""Coyote Ugly."" I hope more offers for roles such as this come to her. She is amazingly talented if given the challenge.
Desperation runs deep among the three main girls; albeit in different situations, yet they all yearn for the same peace: to love and be loved unconditionally. An all-girls school is definitely the place to showcase this need. One particularly humorous line comes from Tori near the beginning of the film. While taking Mary to their room, she tells her about the food on campus, stating ""we mostly save up our allowances and order pizza or Chinese, and, you know, the anorexics just eat erasers."" Prior to experiencing the desperation of losing love among the three girls, we experience, from a distance, the desperation of women everywhere: the deeply-rooted desire to be desirable, to be wanted, to be valued as someone, without the burdens of who we are on the outside. From the outside, Pauline and Victoria are two good-looking girls who go to a boarding school. Inside, they are two desolate souls being pulled from what they know to be true. The cruel world that they reside in will never allow them to be as one.
Freud would say this is an inevitable recipe for madness, yet he would justify that by stating that it is simply because of society forcing sexual repression upon Pauline and Victoria. This might be true, but as Pauline passionately tells Mary, ""I AM NOT A LESBIAN! I AM PAULINE IN LOVE WITH VICTORIA!"" She is a soul in love with another. No gender, no face, no creed. Just one belonging to the other. Forever.
Pauline attacks her desperation with conformity, something quite unusual for her. This proves futile and the facade remains, dancing away into a new life without her. We can all identify with Pauline's desire for love without obligation, without a cost to who we really are. Sometimes the desire comes to fruition, and sometimes not. We can only hope for the former, and truly understand that the one and only definitive, eternal source of unconditional love is inside ourselves. With that, we will always be able to fly to our own undying glory.",1022025600,,2671,4.721627408993576

While the script isn't full-tilt perfect, and yes, it is Canadian so the cinematagrophy is very TV-esque (haven't you ever watched any other Canadian films?), Piper's knock out performance is worth it alone, and the girl who plays Mouse (and also plays a girl in love with a girl on the excellent TV series Once and Again) deserves credit just for the amazing projects she's been associated with in just the first few years of her carrear.

1651113,3,B00005QW9L,"The soul of the book lost and delirious indeed
I'll say it up front.  If I hadn't read 'The Wives of Bath' (Susan Swan), on which this film is loosely based, I would have enjoyed it much more.  Set in an all-girls' boarding school, the story belongs to Mary Beatrice 'Mouse' Bradford (Mischa Barton, 'the Sixth Sense'), transferred mid-semester and introduced into the lives of Paulie (Piper Perabo, 'Coyote Ugly') and Tory (Jessica Pare), best friends who are soon discovered to be lovers.
 The very heart of Paulie's hatred of her own gender and desperation to find some way-no matter how extreme-to make her love for passion for Tory acceptable, and the journey she and Mouse take together, are almost completely done away with.  Tory is no longer gentle.  She has been transformed into the streoetypical ""slut""  (newcomer Pare is passable in the role, helped along by Perabo's ferocity)  And the plot twists involving Tory's romantic relationships are erased completely, leaving much of this stirring novel flattened.  Instead, a falcon metaphor is brought in to repeatedly bash us over the head with, a lot of Shakespeare is bandied about, and the ending, along with much of the original plot, is a new creation far less satisfying than Swan's creation.  Mouse is no longer enigmatic and quiet; she's exposition in a kilt, and Mischa Barton's dull-voiced, empty-eyed performance makes this even more painfully obvious.
 But despite flaws both from the perspective of a fan of the novel and the ideas that are just plain irritating (Paulie=untamed predator.  *We get it.*), the love and passion at the center of the story are still there.  Perabo delivers a gut-wrenching, honest, fully un-self conscious performance, genuine emotions and furious passion bleeding through her voice and every movement.  Her own dignity is perfectly visible during her love scenes, which she handles with delicacy and tenderness, but she is unafraid and completely raw throughout the entire film.
 Love is not limited between genders, races, age or religion.  Paulie states it perfectly when she explains in frustration: '(<I'm not a girl in love with another girl>), ""I'm Paulie in love with Tory.""  Through Paulie's eyes, we see beauty, friendship, trust and devotion from new, previously undiscovered angles, and we see betrayal and escape.  I credit more of this to Perabo's abilities than I do the inconsistant screenplay.
 It's worth seeing, I'll give it that much, but it doesn't present any oppertunity for the viewer to ponder its motives.  The film's story presents its point, but doesn't allow us to take anything away from it besides its ideas.  Swan's novel, however, presents us with a complicated maze of confusion, ignorance, sadness and rage, and lets us decide what impressions her story is intended to leave behind.  The bewildering burst of confusion's psychadelic colors and soft, bittersweet tones of anger are left behind for softcore girl-on-girl action.  It isn't a bad film, it's simply an unnecessary one.  It doesn't shame the novel,  but it oversimplifies it to the point of being its own, far less intriguing, story.  Go read the book.  You'll forget the film within six months, but 'The Wives of Bath' will haunt you for years after you finish it.",1019347200,14,3264,5.076923076923077

She has her first dizzyingly exhilarating taste of love (forbidden at that) and then is cruelly broken up with.  Not to mention the girl has serious emotional issues to being with.
So, it's only natural she's going to turn moody, passive-aggressive, and, being the teenage romantic she is, start moping around the forest spouting poetry.  This is what romantic, distraught kids do.  In that way, I think it's an excellent portrayal.
I'd also like to point out that during another movie about boarding school, Dead Poets Society, when all of the snobby prep school boys starting getting pretentious and spouting poetry they knew *nothing* about, everybody gushes all over that film.

Many of the lines that came out of the girls nouths were so over dramatic and a bit ridiculous. I cannot say much for the direction either. A lot of iffy elements. But the point is we cannot blame Piper for everything. She did have some really good moments, especially the ones with Jessica Pare.
But, in spite of all the bad things, I thought it was a decent movie. The plot is there and there were a lot of things that were nailed right on the head. The story is one that most people can relate to, no matter if you are gay or straight. Eseentially it is about the perrils of first love. The destruction and rise. I stayed with story throughout the movie and was touched in the end but, again the end was a little over dramatic.

Of course she was in love and heartbroken but did she have to be soooo dramatic? Piper Perabo is beautiful, no doubt. But her acting skills is not Oscar worthy.
The film is a rental and not for the weak hearted and close minded viewer. There are some scenes where you see Piper(Paully) and Jessica(Tori)making love.

I try as much as possible to avoid using such generalizing terms because it is very apparent to me that a great deal of what is out there on the indie scene really is not art at all. However, in recent years studios have sunk to new lows. Now more than ever major studios are pandering to the teen market with incredibly mediocre comedies that need only to include a scene of someone farting to gross 100 million. That said, it is easy to see how anyone who cares about film as an art form rather than just frivilous entertainment will seek stuff elsewhere.
This has given rise to the ""indie scene."" It is exactly because indie movies tackle tough subjects and are essentially the antithesis of big Hollywood productions that they deserve seriosu attention. In the last year alone, most of my favorites were ""indie"" films. Amelie, Ghost World, Reykjavik 101, The Crimson Rivers, The Widow of St. Pierre are all examples of the genre doing what it does best, producing intelligent, thought provoking and still entertaining films.
Unfortunately though for every genre there are going to be a number of dismal filsm. I can say without any hesitation that ""Lost and Delirious"" is one of the worst films in recent memory. (The Center of the World gets second prize). I don't like to make swift judgements but I honestly believe that anyone who likes this film is an idiot. Not only is it cliched (that ridiculous gardener) and dull, but it is completely bereft of any kind of artistic ingenuity.
It was obviously made by some mindless feminist. Every time the film seemed to run out of gas (every three minutes) somebody would have to break down and cry while some Sarah McHlachlan hybrid girl group would be piped in.

If you can put yourself past hang-ups about sexuality, or the way girls ""should"" act, then I advise you to buy this.  It's worth seeing, and keeping.",1002067200,11,529,4.526315789473684
1651257,4,B00005QW9L,"You probably recognize Piper Perabo from the movie she did last year, ""Coyote Ugly."" She did OK in that, but in this movie she really lets loose and proves herself an actress of intense emotion. The story's about a new girl (Mischa Barton) who moves into a boarding school and rooms with Tori (Jessica Pare) and Pauline (Perabo). Tori and Pauline are involved in a steamy, emotionally intense relationship until they are discovered in bed together.  Feeling threatened, Tori breaks it off and Pauline tries to furiously win her back. I really liked the story line of the movie, especially the way Pauline acts after the relationship has broken off. I thought Barton also did a good job as the shy new roommate, and Pare was good in her role as well. But it's Perabo who fires this flick up, her performance is enough to make those who dismissed her after ""Coyote Ugly"" sit up and take another look. Only part I had trouble with was the ending, it was a bit weird and too fantasy-like for a movie like this. Still, it's definitely worth seeing.",1000771200,16,1043,4.60752688172043
1651258,5,B00005QW9L,"This movie is beyond anything I've seen. The first time I watched it, I thought I would know every twist and turn. I prepared myself. But throughout the film I became filled with all these emotions for these characters. Mary ""Mouse"" Bradford, Pauline Oster, and Victoria Moller were all differently and beatifically captured by Lea Pool's artistic eye. The story follows three girls in a boarding school, two who have fallen in love and the other caught in the middle of the drama. Both the script and performances are memorable and emotional. As the story unfolded, I started to care for Paulie's grand show of love, Tori's fears, and Mouses' confusion towards the loyalties of both friends. I watched the most heart-wrenching scene ever-depicted on screen. Tori tells her sister that nothing really happened between her and Paulie --- the camera goes into slow motion, the song Beautiful by Me'Shell Ndgeocello comes on and Tori realized she just betrayed Paulie. The movie progresses towards a shocking ending and is filled with symbolism and Shakespearean poetry.  Lea Pool has captured first love and all it's anguish. Love is love and transcends beyond anything ""because love is! It just is because nothing you can say can make it go away because it is the point of why we are here. It is the highest point and once you are up there, looking down on everyone else, you are there forever."" as Paulie puts it.
Lost and delirious is a very beautiful and unique film, which deals with the implications of love. The film captures what love really is, an all-encompassing,life-affirming feeling. I truly, madly, deeply recommend this film.",1000425600,196,1639,4.938405797101449

Its rare to see a movie were the story and a few characters can be the whole movie and succeed on all levels, without some big special effects or outrageous humour.

It brought me to tears, it made me laugh, and it really screwed with my emotions...I was crying for 3 days after I saw it the first time, then 6 days later I went back to see it again. I would be honestly surprised if Jessica Par doesn't become high demand after this amazing performance as a girl torn between her true love and what her parents expect out of her. I loved it, I can't wait for it to come out on video so that I can watch it every day. You can watch it from different views, as it is told by Mary, but you can also see it in Polly and Tori's perspectives. A must see for everyone, but be warned that there is a shocking ending.",997920000,2,680,4.044444444444444
1651261,5,B00005QW9L,"I viewed this film in Canada last week, and i really enjoyed it.  The story follows three girls named Mouse/Mary, Paulie, and Tori.  Mouse is new to the all-girl boarding school, and she is roomates with Paulie and Tori.  At first Paulie and Tori's behavior is a bit suspicious to Mouse, for example, she saw them holding hands during choir and even kissing outside, but Mouse just thought they were practicing for boys.  However when Paulie and Tori start having sex while Mouse is in the room, it became obvious they were in a lesbian relationship which Mouse became used to after a while, and the three girls become vey close after a while.  Later on in the film, Tori's sister suprises the girls and bursts into their room and to her suprise she caught Tori and Paulie lying naked together in bed.  If Tori's parents ever found out about this, they would never think of Tori the same way again, so Tori convinced her sister nothing happened.  Out of shame and fear her parents would find out, Tori broke it off with Paulie and they drifted apart.  Paulie was heartbroken!  She couldn't believe Tori would do such a thing, they had been so deeply inlove and now out of fear of what other people would think she just broke it off with her, how unfair.  Paulie eventually became obsessed with trying to win Tori back, she even challenged Tori's boyfriend to a dule, but nothing won back Tori.  As time passed Paulie became more and more desperate while Tori got more an more frustrated with her.  Later on in the film, Paulie does something that will change things forever, but I don't want to spoil anything.  I would definately reccomend this film to everyone.  It is a beautiful movie, the acting is great, the plot is good, and the movie is just entertaining!  Go see it if it is playing near you.",997833600,6,1802,4.535603715170279

I am a teenager, so I know what teenage angst is like and that is certainly not it. This film is full of petty melodrama thatis completely cliche. If you are looking for a good film see Kids, Gummo, Ghost World, or Bully. I'm sure the people that liked this film that are reading this review are and thinking that I am too young to get it or something like that, which is not true at all. I asked for Citizen Kane on my fifth birthday ... . I have loved film since the day I was born and I know a good movie when I see one. Anyway, I think that I am done ranting for now.
P.S. You might like this film if you are pubescent 13 year old girl that is trying to find a reason to feel sorry for herself.
Oh and one more thing, I apoligize if I came off as being conceited or condescending.",997315200,6,957,3.9381443298969074
1651263,5,B00005QW9L,"This film captures teen angst wonderfully. Some may just chalk it up as a lesbian love story, but as the main character Paulie puts it, it isn't about being gay or bi or whatever, it's just about Paule in love with Tory and Tory being in love with Paulie, even though she prefers to deny it. A sort of Romeo and Juliet, or perhaps Romie and Juliet. I really enjoyed this film and the ending was incredibly sad. You wanted to hate Tory for what she was doing to Paulie, yet I couldn't bring myself to despise her because she was simply in denial. She was more afraid of people thinking badly about her than to stand up for love. The love scenes between the two girls were handled very skillfully, I thought, showing how they felt without being overly erotic. They aren't lesbians, they're just in love. As for Mouse, as someone who has known what it's like to be shy and withdrawn, I totally understood her. When she was with Paulie in the woods cursing at her father in a very un-shy girl like manner it was like deja vu for me. Piper Perabo is an awesome actress, she was definitely able to flex her acting skills more in this than in ""Coyote Ugly"", unlike most actresses who only know how to be cute or sweet. Her descent into madness was almost Ophelia-like, only more realistic and modern. And if you don't at least have tears at the corners of your eyes in the end, you're a hard person.

7950999,2,B00005QW9L,"Our first loves are terribly powerful, and that truth is maybe the only thing this movie gets right.  And so much is wrong, but I'll stick to two things to keep this relatively short.  First, the ""main"" character is relatively insignificant to the primary focus of the story, and it makes for a lot of clumsy stitching of stories and around-the-fringes cruft.  Many scenes feel like filler, or simply concocted to be morose.

Second, finding your way back to living your life after having your heart ripped out is one of the essential human experiences.  Failing to get past a broken love and jumping off a building is not.  Instead of treating this school-age love affair, and the eventual fallout, with respect for the characters and viewers, it's played for gratuitous lesbo tit-shots and melodrama.

I liked the scene where the main character begins to accept that her roommates are ""sleeping together"" in the same room where she sleeps.  That struck me as realistic and human, but ""movie interesting,"" as well.  There aren't nearly enough scenes like this.  Instead we see histrionics that don't ring true, and, once again, the only out gay character is the one who can't handle her s***.

Sadly, this works slightly better as pervy smut than as a real story about young love.",1468281600,,1281,4.830275229357798

7951001,1,B00005QW9L,"Lots of spoilers in this review because I consider it an essential public service to warn people away from this movie.

Lost and Delirious (2001) is basically Dead Poets Society with girls. Except with the Bury Your Gays trope more explicitly gay. There's also a strong Psycho Lesbian trope, in that a thwarted lesbian relationship drives one character to increasingly bizarre and violent behavior and suicide. Hey, I told you there would be massive spoilers. Don't blame me if you're still reading.

This movie belongs to the genre of hot-house boarding school stories, in which same-sex relationships bloom and are cut off well before their prime. Mary, the new girl at an upper-crust all-girls boarding school ends up rooming with two girls, Tori and Paulie, who are involved in a hot-and-heavy relationship. All three have problematic relationships with mothers: Paulies birth mother gave her up for adoption and she is currently trying to track her down and contact her. (When she eventually succeeds in locating her, the woman refuses to allow contact.) Marys mother died three years ago and she feels shes being sent to school to make room for her stepmother. Toris mother is trying to make her over into her own image as a socialite. A running subplot involves two of the school's teachers who are widely rumored to be lovers.

While Mary figures out shes ok with pretending not to notice the sex going on in the next bed over, the balance is upset when Toris sister barges in one morning when the lovers are still naked in bed together. Tori freaks out about the potential for being outed and throws Paulie under the bus, claiming she was the sexual agressor and that she (Tori) is perfectly straight. To support this, Tori takes on a program of public heterosexuality, sneaking out to date and have sex with a random boy, selected due to a chance meeting. When Mary chooses to be supportive of Paulie, she takes the risk of being labelled a lesbian herself.

Theres a subplot where Paulie finds an injured Harris Hawk and secretly rehabilitates it in the woods. (I will now forgo discussing the logistics of bird of prey rehabilitation as the event is clearly meant to be Deeply Symbolic and practicality need not intervene.) Paulie is the hawk, a fierce wounded creature. She makes bold symbolic gestures, including a chivalric declaration of love in the library while wearing her fencing gear and carrying an epee.

But both the girls are terrified to name their sexuality. Relevant quote, Im not a lesbian! Im just Paulie in love with Tori and Toris in love with me. In a late night encounter, Tori confesses shell never love anyone but Paulie but that they can never be together.

Paulie has always played the role of Bad Girl, which initially masks her acting out of her emotional crisis. As in Dead Poets Society, poetry and Shakespeare and drama are the medium through which strong emotions are expressed within this shrine of classical learning. This framing drives Paulie to challenge Toris boyfriend to a literal duel on the night of the big school formal (at which all the parents are present) and to cut in when Tori is dancing with her father, threatening a confrontation where she declares her love. Tori, terrified, rejects her. Mary is having her own issues, as her father fails to show up for the dance and Paulie taunts her into confessing that she hates her father, using Lady Macbeths Unsex me speech, and then recruits Mary as her second for the duel.

They meet the boys in the woods with swords, and the duel ensues, but Paulies using an unblunted sword and actually stabs her rival in the leg. The scene cuts to Mary running across the field where all the students and teachers are gathered in a picnic to find Tori, and we see the hawk flying up, called to Paulie where she stands on the rooftop of the school. We see Paulie begin to fall, then see the hawk flying away, and we see all the girls staring up at the roof in horror. But Mary, our viewpoint protagonist, is ok, because now we get a voiceover about the lesson she learned from the hawk and how now shell always remember her dead mothers face.

This version of Lesbian Tragedy (the plot that Emma Donoghue classifies as Rivals) always marks out the butch character for death while allowing the femme character to recant and be redeemed. At the beginning of the movie, I don't recall there being an obvious butch/femme distinction between the Paulie and Tori. But as the emotional crisis progresses, Paulies presentation becomes more and more masculinized, culminating in her wearing a suit at the school dance, envisioning herself as Toris knight, and more explicitly with the Unsex me speech. Tori drags herself by force into a normative female role by her pursuit of a heterosexual sexual experience. So rather than their gender performances locking them into the fates of their respective roles, once those fates were set in motion, the gendered roles claimed and assimilated them.

This is definitely a Do Not Recommend. This is the sort of movie that could convince an entire generation of young lesbians that they are doomed. The fact that movies like this are still being made in the 21st century is a crime.",1461283200,3,5211,4.7811111111111115
