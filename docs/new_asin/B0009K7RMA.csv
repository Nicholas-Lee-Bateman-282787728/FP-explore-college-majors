2296555,1,B0009K7RMA,"The only thing that saved this movie, as backwards as it sounds, is the fact its so horrible, you can laugh at how bad it is. The story is beyond dumb. A dude pulls strings to get Beans out of jail, just so he can set Beans up to go to jail? He was already in for a minimum 15 years, but they get him out so they can set him up to go back? You have to see it to believe it!! HORRENDOUS!!!!!!!!!!",1121558400,7,395,3.7142857142857144
2296556,4,B0009K7RMA,I watched this movie at the theatres when it first came out and it was just simply Gangsta! I thought the acting was average but overall this movie is worth watching!!!! ROC's in the building!,1121558400,,192,4.514285714285714
2296557,1,B0009K7RMA,"A thousand light skinned women, cursing violent ignorant black men, cameos, blah blah blah. B-O-R-I-N-G. I'm not impressed. I only saw this movie because Blockbuster gave me the wrong movie. I decided to give it a chance. Ugh, this trash will rot your brain. Full of stereotypes, veiled hateful sentiments (toward black men and black women, though in 2 different ways), just plain dumb.",1121212800,5,386,5.046875
2296558,5,B0009K7RMA,"To appericate State Property 2 you have to appericate Ghetto Cinema classics like Dolemite, the oringial State Property and countless others films. The film is no where near as good as Paid In Full or Meance II Society nor is it meant to be. The film provides 90 mins of humor some intended and some uninteded and action. Look for cameo's from the whole Roc A Fella clan and countless others.",1121212800,3,392,4.535211267605634
2296559,2,B0009K7RMA,"What a mess. The fundamentals of acting are gone. You got actors grinning during serious scenes and actors looking into the camera. Not much plot, every 10 minutes somebody gets shot up. A lot of cameos including Mariah Carey, Angie Martinez, Old Dirty Bastard, and Kanye West. I give it 2 stars because of Beanie's performance, at least he tried to act",1120348800,3,353,4.709677419354839
2296560,4,B0009K7RMA,"This sequel actually had a very good storyline but somehow a lot goes wrong. First the acting improved, sigal didn't hit it on his second try but he was close everyone else was ok. This to me and a lot of other fans was a very big problem in the first one, how does a director work his magic with bad actors. There were so many flaws that couldn't go unnoticed like for one Rocawear wasn't created until the late 90's so why are they wearing rocawear in the 70's flash backs and everyone in the whole movie is wearing rocawear. Seriously the only time nobody was wearing it was in the jail scenes to some people this isn't a big problem but to me this is another one of damon dash's hustles. This is suppose to be a serious movie I mean in real life somebody's got to be wearing sean john or enyce. It was too cluttered I think we all know the roc was going to try to fit everyone of their artist in there. Besides those things the movie was ok it almost gets a three for the not so improved acting but the story and plot twist are very creative and it leaves you wondering.",1119916800,,1074,4.119047619047619
2296561,5,B0009K7RMA,I got this joint on bootleg and I have got to say that this is way better than the first state property although both are good hood classics.,1119052800,2,141,4.071428571428571

It is worth watching and it had so many rappers in this movie! Beanie Sigel is the realest guy in the game no doubt! I really don't know if it is better than the first one, but the movie was still straight!

2296636,4,B0009K7RMA,"This is a fun and playful movie. While the story of SP1 was forcefully simple, this plot has hidden twists and turns. Things are not what they seem. We also get backstory on Beans and extended bios on others. This one is plot driven. The first movie was an exceptionally strong character piece, and its urgency and force are not matched by v2. It's still fun. In each case the stories here are Lite. At best they're vehicles for dialogue and character and that's enough. To see these actors in the real, try the documentary ""Backstage"".",1402099200,,536,4.59375

This version though isn't as Gangsta as the first one due to how the first one ended & this movies story line switched it up a lot.

The plot was good, guest appearances was cool (Even though we all know Dipset would never put in work like that). Baby Boy's acting in certain scenes could have been better. The shoot-outs could have been more realistic as well. But for a low budget movie, it wasn't that bad. Trust me, I've seen WAY worse.",1270252800,,493,4.369565217391305

I had a customer buy it and he complained it was a bootleg. And i do not do bootlegs at all, so all my personal collection was original. So it was very upsetting to get my ratings low because somebody like to make low budget mess.",1234396800,,414,4.1875

I've never seen it done in film history, and so sloppily. ok he gets shot & goes to jail at the end of the 1st one and in the beginning of this one we're told, ""that never happened"" lol not even the lame a55 it-was-all-a-dream cop out, just a weird nonsensical, 'sike'. ummm. lol but once u forgive that bullish then its all good.",1231372800,,1255,4.126530612244898

2296687,1,B0009K7RMA,"I don't know if this is a movie or a minstrel show.

I would say that it's two things Beanie Siegel and Dame Dash pride themselves on when making these retarded hood movies. One is ""keeping it straight hood"" another is sterotypes.

There's no need for me say what hasn't already been said about this movie because quite honestly, the horrible quality of this movie speaks for itself.

This isn't black cinema it's black death.

anyone with the intellect that's over 12 years old will let the ""State"" keep this ""Property"".

P.S. What's up with the horrible muti-shot scenes( a bunch of scenes in one shot) near the end of the movie where they are attempting to tie up the loose ends the story( if you wanna call it a story).  I guess Damon Dash is the next Quentin Taratino(sarcasm).",1170720000,6,782,4.55
2296688,3,B0009K7RMA,"When I first heard that they were making a State Property 2, I was so excited. That is until I got it. This movie wasn't gangsta at all. As a matter of fact, it didn't even have a plot. Damon Dash's performance was horrible. He should stick to producing records. Even though the orignal is low-budget, is was way better than this movie. They should have got the guy who directed the first movie. This movie was straight garbage.",1158537600,,428,4.430379746835443
2296689,1,B0009K7RMA,"i don't know if it was intended to be a comedy or action, cause either way it came out wrong, poor acting and unrealistic events. if you luv the ROC. don't see this movie cause it was definately a mistake",1130198400,3,204,4.125
2296690,4,B0009K7RMA,"Damon Dash returns to bring us ""state property 2"" a more light-hearted sequel than it's gritty original.

Beans(beanie sigel)after running from block to block and taking over most of philly in the original is now serving a 15 year sentence in prison and his crew back home in phily is messing up. Their getting robbed, busted by feds, drugdeals are going sour and they are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
when D-nice visits beans in prison and tells him whats going on,
Beans gets pissed and tells them no more ""surprise parties""(watch the film and you know what i mean by that)but he really can't do anything because locked up. Untill he meets ""El pollo Loco""(N.O.R.E) and he tells beans when he gets out of prison in one month he will give his crew work and work means that beans crew will be making money. BUT when El pollo and his partner in crime Biggs turn their back on beans and give beans's crew jobs that involve stealing from another crew(dame dash crew)a 3 way crew battle begins.

Now Unlike it's original movie which was dark, gritty, very street and thug, this sequel plays like a thug-comedy.
From The interactive words and designs flying on the screen, to funny lines from all 3 crew's members, to the violent humour(for Example Beans Imagining he's hitting Dame repeately with a shovel)TO El Pollo telling us how he has a diffrent chick to have sex with for everyday of the week and we are shown him in action with these chicks. It's light-hearted humor comedy and i commend Damon Dash for not just rehashing it's gangsta image from the original but for trying to be different and humorous.

The people you will see in this movie are
Beanie sigel, N.O.R.E, damon dash, camron, ol dirty bastard, kanye west, M.O.P, freeway, bernard hopkins, winky wright, oschino, omillio sparks, young gunz, loon, juelz santana, jimmy jones, and mariah carey.

I suggest you rent this movie and you will have a pretty good time watching it. It's a thug movie blended in as a comedy and if your a fan of ""Roc-A-Fella"" you will love it.
