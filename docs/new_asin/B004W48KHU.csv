4485074,2,B004W48KHU,"Politics of Love largely comes off as one of Tyler Perry's more serious flicks, but without the life lessons and funny moments.  The film tells the story of an unlikely romance between an Indian American Obama supporter, and a Black Republican, shortly before the 2008 Presidential election.

The good news is that the film was shot well.  Decent cinematography and color correction, and a nice soundtrack. The film is also rounded out with a seasoned cast of actors.  Veteran actress Loretta Devine and funnyman Gerry Bednob lead the pack of seasoned actors in this Rom-Com.

Having been a fan of Brian White for eight years now since his role of Tavon in The Shield, it was interesting to see him play a character outside of what he's normally cast as.  He and the beautiful Mallika Sherawat were obviously cast (and shown in skimpy clothing) to appeal to an audience that wanted to see exactly that.

The problem with Politics of Love is that the plot is too simple and predictable.  Man and woman meet, fall for each other, run into problems, and ultimately... Well, how do most movies like this end?  The dialogue is uninspiring, it's easy to predict what direction the film will go in, and it's simply more Rom than Com in this romantic comedy.  Many of the characters are overexaggerated, and you never really feel much for Aretha Gupta's parents as you should.

Politics of Love is worth watching if you're a serious fan of Brian White (I know some of you ladies are), or the gorgeous Mallika Sherawat.  Otherwise, I found it mostly unfunny and sticking to a recycled formula for romantic comedies.  Unlike the Tyler Perry movie ""I Can do Bad All By Myself"", which also starred Brian White, Politics of Love was a box office disaster.  This movie is worth a watch online if you enjoy the work of any of the main cast members, but I don't suggest buying the DVD until you've seen it at least once.",1334361600,,1904,4.6447761194029855
4485075,3,B004W48KHU,The story-line was somewhat cute but clearly implosable in todays political society where political views help define belief systems that people hold dear.  It it one's world-view that are a meaningful part of what attracts one to another person.  This movie was clearly a comedy based upon illogical constructs.,1320710400,,312,5.346938775510204
4485076,2,B004W48KHU,"Now can't you just guess the plot?  Two people of the opposite sex and of opposite camps start of hating each other but eventually get together romantically.  Shoot, I saw a porn flick where a Black woman played a McCain volunteer and a white dude played an Obama supporter too.  Let's just say this film just couldn't possibly have the gravitas of ""MS Masala.""

However, it's novel in some ways.  The woman plays the Democrat.  Yes, women are more like to vote Democrat than men.  However, I think far more Indian Americans vote Republican than African Americans do.  The 1st Indian-American congressman was a Republican and Gov. Bobby Jindal of LA is one.  African Americans are deemed the most loyal Democrats by countless political scientists.  I am an African American and my jaw drops every time I hear of a Black person voting for ""those people.""  Thus, it's surprising to see a Black Republican in a fictional work when there are so few of them around in real life.

And some more things.  I think this film is made by a company that targets a Black audience.  Many Black women feel hurt when they see a Black man with a non-Black woman.  Thus, this film may upset half of its targeted audience.  Further, we live in a racist society where getting with a Black man is often deemed ""marrying down"" or women who get with Black men are deemed ""bad girls.""  Yes, this Indian actress gets more US exposure by starring in this film.  However, something tells me many a non-Black man may look down on her for making this film choice.  It took some bravery on her part to go here.

Now, I personally have no problem whatsoever with some curry-and-barbecued-ribs lovin'!  I'm just saying others might.",1316563200,,1700,4.6375838926174495
4485077,4,B004W48KHU,"The story was very interesting as it depicted a modern romance between members of the  Ascendant Coalition. I like the idea of  showing a romance between  a woman of Indian descent and a black male. Especially, with the black male playing the role of a Republican and the Indian being a democrat supporting future President Barack Obama. Some of the dialog between the mixed members of the Family of the Indian Father  and Black Female Mother were simply hilarious an well done.",1440979200,,478,4.7926829268292686
