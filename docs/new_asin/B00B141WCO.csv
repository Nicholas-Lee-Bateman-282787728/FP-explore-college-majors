Eye and ear candy for folks who's world is our playground, laying back on smooth faces, ripping tubes; threading standing waves; no boundaries. Peter's still shots of kites and boards make magazines, glad he shares these lines!

8560490,3,B00B141WCO,"Good surfers, probably around 2003/4, judging by the boards and wetsuits and taking into account the European equipment time lag.  Great video of Madeira, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and France.  Some interesting frozen locales as well.  I was impressed by the quality of surfer, given that Europeans historically don't perform that well on the WCT.  A ton of talent and beautiful wavescapes over there, still mostly unrecognized by the California/Hawaii/Australia surfing world.  Makes you want to load up a coffin bag and invest a couple years checking out the ""old world""!  Enjoyed watching Kepa Acero and family rip it up.

Full old school video -- just surfing and tunes (ranging from reggae to electronica...lots of electronica!).  Worth a watch for the break from all the typical surf vids.",1402876800,,803,5.21875
8560491,1,B00B141WCO,"This guy traveled for how many years and this is all he manages to put together? The shots are great, but it has no continuity or real story line, it is just haphazardly all over the place. It could of had a lot of potential.

The music is freaking weird, it's like strange 80's european electronic music, really messes with the vibes of the epic waves these european surfers are charging.

It's worth about five bucks, that's about it.

The only reason this guy made it into any film festivals was because he spent so many years out in the field trying to capture something. Probably spent his life savings doing it. I'd give him an award to the ""Pity Party Award"".

Check it out though, pretty neat seeing waves that aren't mainland, south america, or tahiti...just make sure to mute it...
