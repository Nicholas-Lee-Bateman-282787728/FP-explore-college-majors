8525680,5,B0085O9BNU,"I had previously purchased 'Play the Harp Beautifully Level 1 and Level 2' instructional guides and was so taken with the detail and tone that I had to check out Ms. Bruner's video. I was not disappointed.

This video contains two discs, Level 1 and Level 2, that follow the instructional guides.

Ms. Bruner has a calm speaking voice and gentle instructional manner. If you do not have access to a teacher, these books and video are excellent resources to start your harp journey.

She plays each exercise so you can see the hand placements and hear what the exercise or piece will sound like. These lessons are not rushed; she moves slowly through each chapter. When you get to a musical piece to play, she plays the piece slowly counting off the timing, then plays it at the regular tempo. This is so helpful in understanding placement and rhythm.

This is a well made video. Lighting is good, sound quality is good and navigation is easy.

I look forward to my daily practice and Playing the Harp Beautifully.",1371254400,14,1013,4.636871508379889
