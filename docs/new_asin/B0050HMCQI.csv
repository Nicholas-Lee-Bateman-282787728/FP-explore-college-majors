4514173,4,B0050HMCQI,"BOTTOM LINE: Though barely clocking in at an hour in length, this British apocalyptic invasion movie is engrossing, tense and exciting. It's got some decent chills & thrills and a nail-biting down-to-the-wire finale. And who can forget those charming, wonky-looking robots? This film is a small gem that's well worth catching - and now better than ever thanks to this nice hi-def upgrade from the good folks at Kino-Lorber. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): As the film opens we observe the tail end of a mysterious world-wide attack by an unknown force that wipes out approximately 90% of all oxygen-breathing terrestrial life on Earth. After witnessing a few Brits in the act of biting the dust we catch up with Our Hero, a leathery Yank test pilot named Jeff Nolan (Will Parker), who's roaming about the English countryside in a commandeered Land Rover, searching for survivors. Stopping at a small village to get his bearings and grab a few supplies, including a handy shortwave radio, he begins to encounter a handful of survivors as they trickle into town. Not too long afterwards we see the perpetrators of this deadly apocalyptic attack, (or at least their foot soldiers): clanky, clunky robots that can electrocute with their touch. Worse yet, those electro-zaps have the chilling ability to resurrect people after killing them. Soon Jeff and the other survivors find themselves under siege by mechanical men & shuffling corpses. Nolan and the others eventually discover an exploitable weakness in the lumbering robo-enforcers, but they'll have to risk everything if they hope to put a stop to the invaders' plan.

THOUGHTS: For a B-movie programmer this has a surprising amount going for it. The script is, by necessity of the brief runtime, stripped of all fat and trimmed to the bone. The actors all fit their roles perfectly and turn in solid performances. Although hired to attract American audiences, the ""star"" of the picture (Willard Parker) will be, to many modern viewers, essentially an unknown. But don't worry, he does a fine job. Fans of Brit horror & drama will doubtless be familiar with most of the rest of the cast. Direction by Hammer horror legend Terrence Fisher is, as always, first rate. Cinematography is efficient, if unspectacular, though a few shadowy moments of genuine creepiness do pop up here and there. The picturesque hamlet of Shere, where the location stuff was shot, is quite lovely. And yes, the robots are rather laughable and almost certainly non-threatening by today's standards, yet they do have a eerie otherworldly look about them that projects a sense of menace and they're used effectively, if sparingly. The ""zombie"" make-up here is downright unnerving. Similar to the reanimated corpse make-up used to great effect in HORROR EXPRESS, the unblinking boiled egg-looking eyes of the zombies gave me shivers as a young kid... and they're still pretty damn creepy. All-in-all this is a crackerjack little film that has many similarities to several other zombie/invasion films that came later, most notably George Romero's immortal NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. In fact, the only negative observation I have about this film is how criminally short it is. Plus the ending leaves you hanging... this could so easily have been turned into a trilogy. When I first saw this film years ago I thought that it was part of a mini-series and I searched high & low for the other entries. Alas, this is it. A shame.

THE BLU-RAY: The folks at Kino-Lorber have scored another bullseye with their hi-def release of THE EARTH DIES SCREAMING. (Apparently, Kino-Lorber & Olive Films are trying to work their way through the entire catalog of MGM's now-defunct ""Midnight Movies"" line-up?!?) This particular effort looks great. Nice sharp focus, inky blacks & even mid-tones. Only a smattering of dirt & debris, along with a little crush (video noise). Otherwise the video portion of this Blu-ray is outstanding. Audio is clean & clear, with no hissing, pops, crackles, etc. Bonus features include a full-length audio commentary track from historian Richard Harland Smith that's informative, if a bit rambling. There's also a 3-part photo gallery: publicity stills, behind-the-scenes pics & a pressbook for the film. A few trailers from other K-L releases are thrown in, along with the one for this movie. All told, this is a very nice hi-def release. Thanks, Kino-Lorber!",1476144000,14,4405,5.073103448275862
4514174,5,B0050HMCQI,"If you enjoy early British Sci-fi, along the lines of Doctor Who and Quatermass, you will enjoy this movie.  The commentary by Richard Harland Smith is very insightful and adds some value to this package.  The only downside for me was that the running time is rather short.  Highly recommended.",1475971200,4,294,4.84
4514175,4,B0050HMCQI,"This rarely seen British Horror/SciFi Cult Classic was directed by Hammer Films Terence Fisher, who was responsible for the British Golden Age of Horror (1957-1968). This creepy, moody film is very much like a  futuristic Zombie movie, with dead-eyed people stalking the English village! The Invaders are android-like and unemotional. Very effective atmosphere by Fisher.",1472342400,8,371,5.745454545454545

8451179,5,B0050HMCQI,Most enjoyable especially on a rainy day! This British Sci Fi is beautifully restored on Blu ray both sound and picture..Growing up on 50's SCI FI I found this 1964 film to be entertaining and not a bit boring as others have stated. Solid characters make the story pretty believable and it moves quite nicely without alot of dull moments. Remember it was made in 1964 b4 all those CGI effects yes it's no STAR WARS but it is an enjoyable pure escapism film!! 4 s from me!!,1503014400,,472,4.375

8451182,4,B0050HMCQI,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'The Earth Dies Screaming' by Kino Lorber released in 2016.

This movie has one of the most sensational movie names I have ever seen or heard of. The title is way overblown but it's a decent movie anyway. It is a post apocalyptic story about a group of survivors of a world holocaust that gather together in a small town in England.

It's hard to put my finger on it but I just like this movie even though there is nothing special about it.

BLU-RAY: The pictures is very good. It's sharp and crisp and as good as you would expect for a movie being release by itself on blu-ray.

EXTRA'S: The main feature hear is the audio commentary by film historian Richard Harland Smith. These commentaries are always appreciated and usually very informative. However I have the same problem with this one that I have with many others. Most of the commentary is focused on the people involved and their careers. Not so much on the movie. It's just my opinion but I think commentaries should spend most of the time going scene by scene in the movie and explaining what is happening. Often times you will hear a lot of the same information in the commentaries if the people involved have been involved in other movies (which quite often they are.)
There is an image montage .
There are several trailers for other movies by Kino Lorber. They are 'The Satan Bug,' 'Chosen Survivors,' 'Invisible Invaders,' 'Panic in Year Zero' and finally the title trailer.

PLOT/SUMMARY: Jeff Nolan (Willard Parker) is an American in England working on a joint project between the two countries. At the open of the movie he is driving around England with dead people lying everywhere. He can't find anyone alive and stops in a small town where he decides to take refuge in a hotel and try to use a radio to communicate with people. When he gets in the hotel he discover two other people, Peggy (Virginia Field) and Taggart (Dennis Price.) Taggart tells Nolan that they are married but they are not. Taggart convinced Peggy that they would be safer that way. Taggart appers to be shifty sort of fellow and untrustworthy.  Nolan goes outside and discovers that two of the people that were in a car dead are now missing. Shortly, Edgar(Thorley Walters) and Violet make their appearance. They join up in the hotel. Finally a young couple, Mel and Lorna come driving into town. Lorna is pregnant. They too join the rest in the hotel. After discussing the circumstance as to what they were doing when the attack came, they come to the conclusion that it must have been some sort of gas attack on earth. All of the characters were in places where they would not be breathing the outside air.
A little while later....what looks like two people in hazmat suits come strolling into town. Violet decides to go outside and greet them. She is touched by one of the two and killed, but not before we get a close up look. They appear to have to faces and look robotic in appearance.
They bring in Violet's body and they notice that her eyes appear to be mostly white. They lay her body on a bed in one of the rooms.
The group decides that they need to arm themselves and prepare themselves to find others. They go to a nearby armory. They find some guns and return to the hotel. During the evening while Taggart is on watch, Violet seems to come back to life and Taggart shoots and kills her (again.)
The aliens (robots) return. They all decide to take refuge in the armory. When on watch, Taggart knocks Nolan unconscious and kidnaps Peggy. He heads back to town with her. Nolan goes after them. After Peggy runs away from Taggart he takes off. Nolan gets to town as Peggy is being attacked by the robots. He runs one day and discovers that they are in fact, robots. Peggy has a baby.
Back at the armory, Nolan figures out that the robots are being controlled by a local radio tower. Him and Mel go to shut it down. After he leaves the robots attack the armory along with a white eyed Taggard but are stopped just in time when Nolan shuts down the tower.
The survivors head to the airport to go in search of other survivors.

PRODUCTION: This movie had a production budget of around 100,000 pounds (I think it's pounds but it could be dollars.).
The space invaders outfits are ridiculously cheaply made (we later find out they are robots.)

The movie was directed by the excellent Terrence Fisher. Fisher spent most of his time working for Hammer films.

Willard Parker was used because at this time, the English still felt that they had to have an American star in the movie in order to sell it to American audiences.

The opening scenes of the world going down the toilet were actually taken from other movies. Some of the scenes such as the car crash and the airplane going down were taken from 'Village of the Damned.' They are not the same scenes as in that movie but are alternate camera angles that weren't used in that movie.

The movie is short, just slightly over an hour.

THOUGHTS/ As simple as this movie is, it just has a quality about it that makes it enjoyable to watch. Even for the short length it goes by fast.

When Violet runs outside, a greater effort should have been made by the rest to stop her, Especially by Thorley Walters character, who seemed to be in love with her.

For the most part I like post apocalyptic movies especially when they deal with a group of survivors who band together.

CONCLUSIONS: Recommended obviously for fans of the movie that want to upgrade to the best possible picture and fans of 1960's science fiction.

I don't think that getting this one old movie that is only 62 minutes long is a particularly good value but like others I just like the movie even though there isn't anything exceptional about it.
I'm giving the actual movie itself 3 stars and 4 to 5 stars for the picture. I'll give it 3 stars for the extra's (mainly the commentary track.) I'm making it 4 stars because I just want to.

Thanks to Kino Lorber for making this movie available on Blu-Ray.",1491696000,,6014,4.502752293577982
