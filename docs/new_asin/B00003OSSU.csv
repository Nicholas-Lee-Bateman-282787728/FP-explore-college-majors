1332276,5,B00003OSSU,"Namek's final 5 minutes really get going in this tape. Everyone on Namek except for Frieza and Goku are transported to Earth, so the two superpowers go all-out. Unfortunately, the tape ends with Frieza in pieces, so you have  to wait for the next tape to see what happens to him.",953078400,,279,4.470588235294118
1332277,5,B00003OSSU,"Goku has become so powerful but he is still the best good guy around, offering Freiza another chance to turn from his evil ways. Finally, Freiza is getting what he deserves. GO GOKU!",952646400,,182,4.545454545454546
1332278,4,B00003OSSU,"In this 4-episode tape, the endgame between Frieza and SSJ Goku ends with a BANG! In ""The Last Wish"", both Dende and Frieza race toward the giant Porunga, each with their own wish in mind. In ""Duel on a  Vanishing Planet"", with everyone on Namek save Frieza and Goku safely  returned to Earth, the two superpowers go all-out. In ""Pathos of  Frieza"", it appears that Frieza has been defeated by Goku...or has he?  And, finally, in ""Frieza Defeated! "", the mighty tyrant is (AT  LAST) destroyed by his own attack. But can Goku get off the planet before  the explosion?",951696000,5,566,4.61
7919271,5,B00003OSSU,This is an excellent tape and the fighting scenes are excellent too. There is some awsome music in this tape and I just love the way goku looks.,1033430400,,144,4.178571428571429
7919272,4,B00003OSSU,This video kicks... It has four episodes to start off instead of tre and therefore is longer. It has many excellent fighting scenes which show case the events leading up to Freiza getting cut in half. LiterallyGok puts all his strength and it shows. On thing that botered m is that by the third episode it wll get pretty annoying at how many times they mention that planet namek is goingto explode. Other then that thisi a great video which Isuggest you get right away...,1021248000,,471,4.552941176470588
7919273,4,B00003OSSU,"Dragonball Z at first I thought would be a dumb cartoon show. But as soon as I watched this episode I was instatly hooked. I loved the action, and the suspense. I like this one the best out of the Frieza Series. Goku is such a babe ~_^. I Like how the very last episode keeps you hanging. You're not sure whether Goku is going to make it off Namek or not. I've seen all of Dragonball Z, and this would make it in the top 10 episodes that I've seen. I hope you enjoy ^_^.",996019200,,470,3.90625
7919274,5,B00003OSSU,This tape is not only exciting but it's also very cool. BUY IT! A must  have for any DBZ fan that thinks they are a true fan. It's a cool tape.  Even though Goku really doesn't destroy Frieza(Trunks finishes him off in  the Trunks saga) he still beats him. And on this tape it proves just how  much of a kind man Goku really is. Buy it or get left in the dust! 'Nuff  said.,966470400,,373,3.92
7919275,5,B00003OSSU,"Goku has just transformed into a Super Saiyan after the death of his close friend Krillin.  Frieza is in for a shock as Goku makes some pretty devastating moves.  But, Frieza isn't finished yet and still has a Trump  card.  Goku battles all out as Frieza goes to 100 percent of his power.  When things are looking bad for Earth's hero,  and Frieza is about to  finish his job... The mighty midget Gohan shows up to confront his fear,  and to attempt a win against Frieza.  I do suggest buying this tape.  This  tape is one of the few tapes where there are 4 episodes. And, if you  thought that Goku was powerful before, this tape shows him at a new level  of might.",963014400,,665,4.266129032258065

7919277,5,B00003OSSU,"If you relly like the frieza saga then this should be your first pick. it looked good on cartoon network but its even better this time around(YOU WOULD BE SUPRISED AT HOW MUCH THEY TAKE OUT). aside from being 4 episodes  long,all of them are cool (my favorite was when frieza gets cut in half by  his own power) now i must warn you if you want to see frieza die this is  the wrong video to get ... but it makes the next one more fun and not so  stupid.",953078400,4,452,3.934065934065934
