1805626,4,B00007AJDL,This is a great video to introduce children to the world of baby animals.  My son loves it.,1178928000,,91,4.055555555555555
1805627,5,B00007AJDL,"I love watching shows about animals on Animal planet, Discovery and national Geographic, but it can be heartwrenching to see the animals get stalked and killed (even though this is the way nature intended!).

This DVD is very uplifting to watch, no killing, only happy baby animals with their mothers.

Not sure how they got all the scenes, but it is very enjoyable.  The polar bear cubs are exquisite!

Definitely worth the money- for kids or adults.",1178064000,37,451,4.818181818181818
1805628,5,B00007AJDL,"MY kids LOVE this show. It's over 3 and a half hours- even I found myself fascinated with this show- it's worth it's money. It is a documentary form, but it switches animals fast enough to keep my kids watching. It's so educational I decided to make it a part of their preschool class (I teach them). My kids are more mellow, and they just love animals- I'd recommend it to anyone! If your kids for some reason get bored with the documentary voice, maybe you can turn down the volume and play some nice music. This video is certainly worth the effort!!",1171324800,18,552,4.368932038834951
1805629,2,B00007AJDL,While this DVD has nice video it is narrated as a documentary. I brought it for my young son who loves animals and he lasted less then ten minutes with it. Not entertaining for children.,1152835200,15,186,4.3428571428571425

7974938,4,B00007AJDL,"It is an excellent film.
1. They take baby animal films that are really hard to see by person -- mothers are always aggresive to protect their babies. As they decribed at the end of film, they put the recorder there and got it back several days later. Therefore, we can see more naturally actions of baby animals.

2. However, the background speaks makes me asleep. I can't say it's boring but it's kind of old fashion educational scientific style and I am always not a very concentrating student (laugh) Maybe they should try some more energitic, light classical next time.

But I really need to emphasize it again -- I love the film",1227916800,9,634,4.552631578947368
7974939,4,B00007AJDL,"Most of the footage is old, from the 80' I guess, and the narrative style is oldfashioned and classic. But my little son (1 1/2 year old) loves it and likes to watch all the fun and cute little animals. We don't speak english in our family, but he doesnt mind the spoken language at all. This is great for all who loves animals.",1220832000,,328,4.140625
7974940,5,B00007AJDL,"I love the facts and pictures of all the baby animals, my little guy has watched this over and over. He is 5 now, still loves watching it. You can pick which animals to watch on the menu.",1210636800,4,187,3.9473684210526314
