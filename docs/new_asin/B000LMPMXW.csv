8162186,5,B000LMPMXW,got it on time.  great DVD no problems. My students love this video he takes his time and shows the napkin fold twice with easy directions.,1353024000,,139,4.346153846153846
8162187,1,B000LMPMXW,"I was very disapointed in recieving this dvd.  First it only plays in certain players not just in any dvd player, and the centerpieces that ""Chef Ted"" made look like a 4th or 5th grader could do them.  There are MUCH BETTER carving vids out there please look for another one before buying this disk",1226275200,,298,4.4
8162188,1,B000LMPMXW,"The centerpieces are not spectacular, they are very low age juvenile and pretty silly looking.  There was not one thing or technique that impressed me whatsoever and he used the same food items over and over again. It was boring, his voice was annoying, the centerpieces were not anything I would ever use for anyone's party over 11 years of age.  Overpriced piece of work.
His napkin folding video was useable so I bought this one.  I want my money back!",1221868800,,455,4.592592592592593
