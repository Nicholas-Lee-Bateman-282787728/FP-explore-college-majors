8049893,5,B0007OQANA,"Two seasoned PROs in Southern Gospel Music, George Younce (Cathedral Qt famed Bass singer) and Jake Hess (Statesmen Qt famed Lead singer) join with Wesley Pritchard on Baritone) and Ernie Haase on Tenor to create a wonderful close harmony album of some of the best loved songs in the gospel music. This is real SGM music and it doesn't get any better. George and Jake have passed over to glory but you can still hear Ernie Haase with his Signature Sound quartet. Wesley Pritchard went on to sing with Signature Sound for a couple years and then into full-time ministry as the Senior Pastor in the Fayetteville Community Church his father founded in Fayetteville, North Carolina.",1331769600,,678,4.853448275862069
8049894,5,B0007OQANA,"If you love Southern Gospel music and if you follow the Homecoming videos, you already know that George Younce and Jake Hess are gospel music legends.  It is so awesome to watch these two interact.  They were a great combination, and their many fans miss them terribly. This DVD features both George and Jake A LOT, which is only fitting.  They were the stars.
  There is also some really neat humor.  George was a tremendous MC and had a gift for making people laugh, and Aaron Wilburn is also on here.  He is very funny without being crude or vulgar.
  The song selection is top notch. And the whole project is put together with the kind of dignity and class that people expect from the Gaither Gospel Series.
  If you like quartet harmony and good gospel music.  You won't be disappointed in this one.",1323475200,,804,4.506944444444445
8049895,5,B0007OQANA,Good dvd as always good music from Jake Hess and company.  It is sad most of the old and good ones have gone on to what they sang about.,1313971200,,136,3.689655172413793
