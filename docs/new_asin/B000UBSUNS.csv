8212826,3,B000UBSUNS,"The synopsis posted as of 28 Jan 14 is completely off the mark.  The plot is about a search light unit in Britain during WW II, covering apparently a period of at least a year,  Ian Carmichael plays an officer from the parent battery who pops in to check on the unit from time to time.  Contrary to the Wikipedia article, the officer is not inept but controls his troops with understanding while still ensuring that they stay on the ball.  The presence of a young Benny Hill is misleading.  While there are comic moments, this is not a comedy, and his character has as much drama as humor.  This is a typical small scale post-war British war movie, not particularly exciting, but covering an aspect of Britain's air defenses which is often overlooked.  Ultimately a depiction of ordinary men in an important, but not exciting mission.",1390867200,2,834,4.63265306122449
