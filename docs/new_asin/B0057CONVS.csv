4595198,5,B0057CONVS,"In 1971, all PBS tried to do was set up mics, lights, and keep rolling for several months.  This large ""rich liberal suburban"" family is a rare snapshot of the times. Although 1 or 2 family members do ham it up on occasion, their personalities are essentially intact.  If you prefer a less decadent family, watch PBS ""The Farmer's Wife"" filmed in 1994 for an equally raw and informing portrait.",1350259200,,394,4.614285714285714
4595199,2,B0057CONVS,"I was disappointed in this DVD as I expected the original series, not snippets and ""after the fact"" scenes.  Apparently the original mini-series was never recorded and this is all that was ever taped.",1341446400,10,200,4.882352941176471
4595200,3,B0057CONVS,"Awhile ago I reviewed a VHS recorded edition of ""An American Family,"" the first true reality TV show featuring the Loud family of Santa Barbara, CA circa 1971.  A remarkable documentary, but those who think they are getting the entire series on one DVD are sorely mistaken; bear in mind this is strictly a documentary on the series and the work of Craig Gilbert, the series director, and an overview with highlights from the show running approximately 95 minutes.

Nonetheless, for the uninitiated to the series, it is still a worthy foray into the show with some engaging interviews and background into the show, its historical significance, and its impact on reality television to this day.  For more information about the series itself, please check my review on ""An American Family""--a plea to the powers that be at PBS or elsewhere to transfer this seminal television artifact to DVD for all to enjoy.",1340236800,12,906,4.908496732026144
4595201,5,B0057CONVS,I missed this on PBS and Amazon was the only place I could find anything about An American Family. I Loved it and thanks Amazon!,1323820800,,128,4.16
4595202,4,B0057CONVS,"In 1971 - for 13 weeks many folks in America - including me - watched the first ""reality TV"" show (though there wasn't a word for it then.) There was also no PBS. It was NET (for National Educational Television). The New York affiliate of NET (ironically called WNET) produced a 12 hour documentary on ""an American family"". As the original WNET Producer reminds us in the bonus feature interview, this was not a ""typical American family"", or an average one. But it was truly American. The Louds (Bill and Pat) had 5 teenage children. They allowed the cameras of Alan and Susan Raymond to follow them for seven months from May to December 1971. The cameras were at their home in Santa Barbara,CA and in New York where openly gay son Lance moved. They follow them as they go to Europe. During this 7 months Pat and Bill separate and divorce.

For the 40th anniversary of the show, WNET worked with the Raymonds to re-edit the 12 hours of film down to 1 hour and 50 minutes. The show aired earlier this year on PBS and is now on this DVD. 53 minutes of Bonus features are here too including an archival panel discussion from 1973 lead by Margaret Mead and new interviews with NET and WNET personnel - including the Raymonds.

It's a fascinating story , though, like a previous reviewer, I felt that it worked best in the longer chapter-ized version, which allowed things to be revealed at closer to real time. But this is still better than nothing. And the additional interviews add more perspective to the story. After all, this was a FIRST for NET - a real series.

The show was shot on film and it shows some age. Those used to the crisp images on TV today will have to settle for some graniness. The clothes (and even Bill Loud's ""long sideburns"" will bring back the 70s even more than an old Sonny and Cher or Fifth Dimension song.

This is an iconic moment in American TV and it's good that it has been released, even in a truncated version.

4595203,2,B0057CONVS,"I just wish they could just get the music licensing issues handled so that they could release the series in it's entirety. All the highlights and commentary can't express the impact of actually seeing the full programs.

I'll skip this and wait for the real thing.",1313366400,35,264,4.739130434782608
4595204,5,B0057CONVS,"This DVD presents highlights of the 12-part series that became one of the most talked about television programs in America in 1973 -- perhaps in the entire decade. ""An American Family"" moved cameras into the California home of Bill and Pat Loud and their five children. (Lance, the oldest child, lived for a time at the legendary Chelsea Hotel in New York; Pat's visit to him there is one of the most memorable sequences of the series.) Eventually Bill and Pat separated -- an event shown on camera -- but remained friends (difficult, but, as these people proved, not impossible). They continued to care for each other and for their children.

It's often erroneously stated that Lance was the first openly gay person on nationwide TV. Although that was never made explicit, it's not difficult to read between the lines. And his family was completely accepting of him -- including his father, who was something of a macho type (he owned a company that sold replacement parts for heavy machinery). Bill's obvious affection for Lance is, to use an old-fashioned word, heartwarming.

This is often considered the first reality show. The difference is that it's real reality, unlike the scripted, manipulated kind all too common in today's shows of that description. Viewing it today, I find it just as engrossing as it was way back when. Highly recommended.",1310083200,34,1353,4.9298245614035086
8460510,3,B0057CONVS,"This was a disappointing video. because it wasn't anything new but, as another reviewer said, just bits and clips of the original.  In 1971 PBS released the first American reality TV series that featured the Loud family of Santa Barbara, California.  The family naively bared their personal lives to the nation and the world and paid a heavy emotional price from what I saw on the original series and on the talk shows that followed the series.  I hoped for some new information about the family and about the making of the original series.  I also hoped to know more about Lance Loud who became beloved by many of us and I hoped to gain more insight into his difficult life as a gay young man in America in the 1970s.  The original series was very good and as close to reality TV as we will probably ever see.  Reality TV as we call it and know it is just another version of rehearsed and edited TV shows that we watch in America everyday.  The stars of these shows only show us what they want us to see.  But the Louds so innocently bared their lives before us and man of us would love to know how they have come out on the other side all these years later.  Hopefully, the next video about this family and series will do it more justice and give those of us who love the Louds a real update about their lives.  Especially I'd like to hear how Pat Loud did over the next half of her life.  In her book, Pat Loud: A Woman's Story, she seemed so hard on herself during the first few years that followed.",1525651200,,1503,4.23859649122807

It's good, however I thought it was going to be the entire series as it was presented then. I  hope someone will release the original series in its entirety. I would be interested in purchasing that.",1505779200,2,286,4.39622641509434

8460514,3,B0057CONVS,"I did enjoy this DVD, but I was hoping to see more.  I loved the mini series so much, I was hoping to see some follow-up of where they are now.  In the early 1980s, I saw an update about the family.  The youngest daughter was engaged and living in NYC.  If there was ever a way to purchase the original program, I would be first in line to get it.  It was still good to see everyone, though.  I was only 14 at the time, but I looked forward to this every week.",1458604800,2,460,3.8404255319148937
