7844301,5,6303359906,"Here are two of the greatest Lupin III episodes ever (heck, I'm hard-pressed to think of ANY recent series that can measure up to these) and it galls me no end that the only way to get them with English sub-titles is on a VHS tape.  Someone needs to re-issue these in a format that doesn't have me trying to pick the dust-kitties out of an old, dead piece of machinery stored for the past decade in my garage.  This is no way to treat the only two episodes of the second Lupin III series that were directed by Miyazaki.",1460678400,,519,4.18
7844302,4,6303359906,"This video contains two of the Lupin III TV episodes.  The first one is ""Albatross, Wings of Death"" and the second is ""Aloha, Lupin.""
In ""Albatross"", Lupin and company are waiting for Fujiku to arrive.  She's Lupin's sometime girlfriend, ally, and competitor.  She's in trouble and so Lupin is off to find out what she's gotten herself into.  What he finds is a rich ""madman"" who's stollen nuclear components to make bombs and has them in his ""Sproose Goose"" style plane known as ""Albatross"".  Fujiku comes off strong in this episode despite being a prisoner for much of the episode.  The final fight on board the plane is pretty enjoyable as well.
In ""Aloha"", Lupin and crew are robbing jewerly stores with the help of a powerful robot and her naive creator.  Lupin and his gang don't seem right and shortly thereafter it is revealed that they are impostors when the real Lupin shows up.
Lots of fun, but at 25 minutes per episode, these go buy very fast and don't have a lot of time to tell a great story.  Still, if you like Lupin III, I'd recommend adding this to your collection.",1027728000,3,1084,4.551546391752577
