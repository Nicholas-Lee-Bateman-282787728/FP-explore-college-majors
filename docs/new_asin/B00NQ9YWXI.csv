6676598,5,B00NQ9YWXI,Andre showed clips from prior concerts over the years. Perfect. One of his best,1417305600,,79,4.714285714285714
6676599,5,B00NQ9YWXI,"Beautiful music, great performances by his singers and musicians.  Always a pleasure to listen and watch.",1417132800,,105,5.5625
6676600,5,B00NQ9YWXI,"Absolutely one of the best performances I have ever seen.  I really enjoyed Amira, the 9 year old soprano!!  DVD is well made and the sound is phenomenal!!",1416355200,3,155,4.5
6676601,2,B00NQ9YWXI,"I HAVE 30 ANDRE RIEU DVDS AND THIS DVD IS MISLEADING FROM THE TITLE ""LOVE IN VENICE"".  WHITE BANNERS (FLAGS) WAVING IS DISTRACTING AND MANY, MANY NUMEROUS VIEWS OF THE AUDIENCE IS IN POOR  TASTE.  PURCHASED THE DVD TO HEAR AND VIEW ANDRE RIEU AND HIS FANTASTIC ORCHESTRA NOT THE AUDIENCE AS MENTIONED ABOVE.",1416355200,12,307,4.648148148148148
6676602,5,B00NQ9YWXI,"Although the DVD was excellent, it is packaged in the same type of package normally used for blue-ray discs, and this can be confusing.  This is not the fault of Amazon, or I should probable say the poor packaging decision of the manufacturer.",1416268800,,243,4.651162790697675
6676603,2,B00NQ9YWXI,"This 10th Anniversary Concert should have been a showcase of the most memorable moments from ten years of Rieu's hometown concerts.  Instead it was a theme show.  Fine except for the fact that very little outside of the scenery is about Venice.  Why have a theme that is basically non-existent in the music?  Neapolitan songs and Italian opera arias (all of which are based in locales other than Venice) are not Venetian, but Rieu is banking on most people not knowing or caring.  Mix in a few waltzes, the obligatory hometown tunes and those that are Spanish or German, and what you get is a mish-mosh that is strung together with the same banter we've all been hearing for years.  The sound quality is fine for a live recording, but there are WAY TOO MANY SHOTS OF THE AUDIENCE.  Fifteen or twenty shots for the entire dvd is more than enough to let the viewer know that the audience was moved by the performance.  I always get the feeling when watching one of Rieu's videos that he is trying too hard to let me know that I should've been there.  To me these audience shots in such abundance are a marketing tool that detracts from the performance for the viewer at home.

Otherwise, the performances are what is to be expected from him and his entourage.  The orchestra gives its usual performance, but must be bored by now with so many years of the same thing.  Vocals are what they are:  good for those who only experience these voices singing these pieces.  Underwhelming for those who have heard these same pieces sung by true artists.  Again, Rieu is hoping you don't know or care.

Bottom line:  if you are a recent Rieu fan and don't remember the good old days when every year was a new and different program, then you'll be happy.  Otherwise, older fans will be seeing a lot of the same old, same old.",1416009600,31,1812,4.489296636085627
6676604,3,B00NQ9YWXI,According to the review above the DVD contains 32 songs and 2 1/2 hours of music...the purchased Love in Venice DVD only has 16 ....and is definitely not 2 1/2 hours...obvious at the end of performance that you did not see all performers!,1415836800,9,238,4.558139534883721
6676605,5,B00NQ9YWXI,"My initial review below was wrong as it was written before I viewed the concert DVD. It does state on the back of the DVD case that it is 16.9 wide screen. However, it played like a 4.3 letterbox full screen. Sorry for the miss information and I won't do another review until I play the DVD first. By the way 5 stars....

I have been buying Andre DVD's since day one. I ordered two copies of Love in Venice (this years summer Maastricht concert).
I per-ordered through Amazon and when I received them, Low an behold they are in widescreen format. Never before did they use this format and it was never listed in the Amazon Product Details page sight regarding this or any other format. So when i play the concert I'll have a top and bottom black screen as a result. Shame on Andre and Amazon for leaving out this important info.
I'm done with Andre from now on.....
Oh, by the way I had to give it one star as it won't except zero stars.....",1415750400,8,941,4.256983240223463

6676623,5,B00NQ9YWXI,"My initial interest in this DVD was created by my being an Amira Willighagen fan.  This is indeed the concert he invited her to perform in not too long after she won the 2013 Holland's Got Talent contest.

Having watched parts of this DVD on YouTube (posted by Andre's company and referencing this title) I knew I liked his style of music and wanted to see the parts of the concert that weren't included in the YouTube samples.  With a length of 2:39:55, this DVD is almost twice as long as some of his concert DVDs are, making it a better bang for the buck than some of his concert DVDs that are specific to a show he did on the road somewhere.",1465257600,3,645,4.227642276422764

She is so amazing, the audience were very happy and they were so emotion, and were in tears.  This video showed more audience than usual, but I think it was done deliberately to show that the audience were satisfied and happy of the concert.
