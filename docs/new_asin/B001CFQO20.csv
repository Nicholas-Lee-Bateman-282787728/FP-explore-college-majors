3512295,5,B001CFQO20,"Forget that review with a 2-star. This anime is a great example of how anime should be done!
It details the story of a teenager named Shiro who is involved in the Holy Grail War, with his partner (called Servants) named Saber. They must go about and defeat the other Servants and Masters in order to win the Holy Grail, which gives it's possessor one wish that it may have granted.
PROS - Great artwork, and great animation. You can tell that it has great production values.
  - Great storyline! It's a bit difficult to follow at times, but if you are attentive, you will understand and enjoy this story.
  - Awesome characters! Each character is in this War for their own reasons, and each character has his or her own personality; no ""vanilla"" characters here! The main character Shiro does seem a bit bland compared to the rest, but that doesn't mean he's a paperweight! The relationship between him and Saber is what's most significant in this anime!
CONS - It seemed a bit rushed in the last episode, and some aspects weren't fully explained (such as the connection between Archer and Shiro, and about the last Holy Grail War).
Overall, this is a must-see anime! You will NOT regret it!",1238198400,,1191,4.60377358490566
3512296,2,B001CFQO20,"I purchased this product based on the reviews seen here.  All I can say, they are probably created by preteen boys.  At their age, I can't fault them for it because I liked Voltron at that age too.

The series consist of mostly fighting.  As such the enemies become more difficulty as the series progresses.  So, it's episodes can be similar to that of Angelic Layer without the fun, enjoyment, and an actual storyline.

There is some romance.  It can be as stale and lacking as is in Green Green or DearS.

For a similar fast pace action and better series look toward Angelic Layer.  For romance, choose Chobits.  If you want gut breaking heartbreak then Elfen Lied would be a good choice.  Warning, Elfen Lied is not a kid friendly anime.",1230681600,7,740,4.53030303030303
3512297,5,B001CFQO20,"Fate/Stay night fought an uphill battle for a few years to get released stateside and I had always heard about the craze for it in Japan, so needless to say I was ecstatic when it was finally brought oversea's a little over a year ago. Of course it was extremelly limited and I had to fight tooth and nail to compelte the collection, but with this new package it can be yours easily.

As for the series itself, its a simple premise, but one with slight nuances and touches that make it interesting enough to sit through. Seven people who are themselves Magus'(people controlling the elements and magic) must summon themselves each one servant to do their fighting in a sort of battle royale to determine which is worthy to recieve the ultimate prize, the Holy Grail. Thats the main jist of this series, but again, I won't say anything more about who or what or why because its a fun series that mixes very well action and plot. The action sequences are some of the best I've seen in a long while, on par with something like the more epic scenes in Samurai 7. This IS a series about magic and beings who posess incredible powers afterall and, more often than not, they will be taking a lot of the environment around them with them during these scenes. I think a great thing about this series too is that its more relatable to our society than most animes because the character's are based off of many cultural, historical figures, not simply those pertaining to Japan.

If you love action scenes in your anime and some good story laid down over a foundation of suspense and dramatic mystery, then you'll love this series. I think it deserve well its enormous following in its native homeland. And who doesn't love a hottie like Saber wielding a simply wicked sword anyways?",1227312000,4,1772,4.551724137931035

3512300,5,B001CFQO20,"Since I am personally somewhat of a TYPE-MOON fan (company that is responsible for producing the Fate/Stay Night PC game this anime is based on) I give this show a 5-star rating, something I rarely give out. I'm not a total TYPE-MOON fanatic though, I haven't played either of their PC games Fate/Stay Night or Tsukihime since I can't read Japanese and/or can't find the games. So I think most people will enjoy this show whether they already knew about it or not. I've only seen this disc with the first 4 episodes on it (out of 24) not the whole series, so that is what this review will be based on.

Story-wise I say Fate/Stay Night gets a 5 out of 5. It's not a perfect 5, and it's not some all-time classic, but it's quite interesting and will almost certainly continue developing in the same intruiging fashion that TYPE-MOON has become famous for. Directing is probably the weakest area of this show, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. It's still fairly good, but the thing that annoys me the most is how everything gets silly the moment that girl with short brown hair appears. I forgot her name, and while she gets her share of screen time I don't think she is an important character in regards to the fights and main plot. I wish she didn't exist, I blame her whenever the atmosphere changes into silliness. The rest of the time Fate/Stay Night is moderately serious and fits the tone I prefer for these types of shows.

Drawing style I give a high 5 out of 5. As I've seen a number of others say, Rin Tohsaka is one of the best character designs ever. Drawing consistency I can't yet comment on as I've only seen 4 episodes, not enough to see how badly the drawings may degenerate in the bad episodes. So far the consistency has been pretty good but I saw some ugly things in the episode five preview. Animation quality is a low 5 stars. For those who saw the Fate/Stay Night trailer (found on some other Geneon DVDs), the general animation quality of the show itself is not quite up to the level of the fights shown in the trailer. But it's not that much worse. There's pretty much no sign of frame-saving efforts ever, it's just not ultra spectacular at all times like the fights in the trailer were. Background drawings are 4 stars, quite nice but not the best I've ever seen. Music is 4 stars, done by well-known anime composer Kenji Kawai, but only a few songs are really memorable. It's inevitable I think when the same composers are over-utilized, they can't produce that many good songs for each show they do. I agree with the previous review that the intro and ending songs aren't that good. They are not composed by Kenji Kawai, only the BGM which is better is by him.

In terms of the genre this show is in, Fate/Stay Night is kind of unique. It's a blend of the fighting/action genre together with the dating sim genre, which is the trademark of TYPE-MOON productions. And I think this is a good enough show to appeal to fans of both genres. It also has an interesting historical feel, as most of the combatants in this show are historical figures from ancient mythology, such as Hercules, Medusa, Sasaki Kojiro, etc. Or so I hear, in the first 4 episodes so far only a couple identities were revealed. Some people might get mad when they find out who Saber is supposed to be. Ha ha ha. I don't know when that gets revealed though.",1184112000,5,3345,4.4269480519480515
8287633,5,B001CFQO20,"I got this used but it came in great shape! Disks are all fine and its box is to. For those buying this is not the extension that's streaming on Netflix. This disk set follows a slightly different path then one on Netflix. But still has the same characters and voice actors. Unlimited Blade Works is the continuation. But for $20 as I got this, its well worth it to see from a different eye set. This is the classic, so worth it its such a gem.",1462233600,,444,4.114942528735632

8287636,5,B001CFQO20,"Shirou lives alone after his adopted father passed away and left him with a huge house. Shirou has the ability to reconstruct objects with his magic. He stumbles across a classmate and a couple warriors in a battle after school. He soon becomes part of ""The Holy Grail War"". A battle fought every so often to obtain the Holy Grail. The winner gets to make a wish. He becomes the master of a legendary warrior spirit. Her name is Saber. Togther with their ally Rin and her servant, Archer, they will fight against ruthless enemies for their 1 most precious wish.

This anime is simply amazing. It has action and drama mixed together with mythology and magic. The modern day setting with legendary mythical heroes is really cool. I normally prefer anime dramas (Kanon, Clannad, Air, etc.) over action series, but this anime combines the 2 genres very well. The voice cast, animation, story, and soundtrack are all top notch. It's a very addicting series. There are many great, and memorable characters that keep you interested in the story and wanting to know more about them. There is also a dash of comedy thrown in there to lighten the mood. It's a very well rounded series with a lot to offer. I honestly think that no matter what genre of anime you're into, Fate Stay/Night will make you a happy camper. I highly recommend it and I hope you enjoy it!",1354924800,,1353,4.614107883817427
8287637,1,B001CFQO20,"This offer for Fate/Stay Night has all the markings of a Bootleg, 1 disc, all regions, from Malaysia...wait...1 disc! That's a lot of episodes on 1 disc, I think that's wrong...probably 3 is more likely.

I've watched my share of bootlegs in the past (I was once a New anime fan) and speaking from bitter experience the quality is dreadful, dialogue doesn't sync up, sometimes the episode skips or locks up.  So if you are a frequent bootleg buyer you'll find everything about as you'd expect.

There is the appeal of price, I realize the American Geneon/Funimation releases are getting expensive...

...but Sentai has re-licensed the series.

So if you are a new fan of Fate/Stay Night, or of anime in general and you are wondering which release to buy I recommend waiting until January and picking up Sentai's Blu-ray release.  The Transfer is from a 720 print of Fate/Stay Night that is of better quality than the previous dvd releases...or you could get the Sentai DVD release... Long term you may find that the better Sentai release reduces the price of those currently expensive releases.

Long story short...Unless you are already purchasing bootlegs and are satisfied with the quality lapse, I suggest waiting...and hey there's a lot more anime out there...if you're new to anime and you 'have' to buy something cheap today...buy something else.",1351296000,,1353,4.960176991150442
8287638,3,B001CFQO20,"This is a well paced anime, with the strongest stretch of episodes being in the middle before and after the change in credit sequences.  The premise of the anime revolves around mages in the present day who battle in a tournament using 7 ""epic hero"" spirits.

These epic heroes are figures of real life legends with great fighting prowess, like Hercules, or say Jean D'Arc.  As they appear in this mage tournament though, they are basically super heroes with super strength, often the ability to fly, and certain special attributes.  A lot of the plot hinges on the stipulations around this mythology, so I won't go further into it.

The main flaw of the series though, is an over wrought love story that begins to monopolize everything towards the end.  Despite some cool action sequences, interesting mysteries, and quality animation, it becomes relentlessly sappy at times.  Its the kind of romance where the lovers are so self involved that you want to punch them in the face.

The series is also undermined by a predominance of female characters, who are pretty regularly reduced to fawning over the singularly male protagonist.  Its sort of like Twilight inverted, with our protagonist mage Shirou's biggest conflict often being his extraneous lady friends.  This unfortunately makes the story pretty boring when the ""epic heroes"" aren't dueling to the death.

To its credit Fate Stay Night has a coherent through line plot across its 24 episodes.  There isn't any ""filler"" or gaping plot holes.  It simply becomes hard to get through at some points because of the juvenile overbearing love story.",1333843200,,1603,4.981203007518797
8287639,5,B001CFQO20,"Now here is a real hidden gem of an anime.

On the surface, 'Fate/stay night' doesn't look that much different from many other fantasy, harem, and high-school drama series.  A fantasy-themed battle anime depicting a variety of ""Servants"" fighting each other may sound a bit derivative on paper. Yet it tweaks the formula just enough to set it apart from similar anime, making it a very memorable and enjoyable series.

For me, the characters are what really make the anime great. All of them are familiar, yet distinctive and with surprising depth. Shirou is a fairly standard male lead for these sorts of anime,  a ""nice guy"" who balances a desire to do the right thing with a reluctance to fight. Sakura initially comes across as a typically shy and submissive girl, but she has a great strength that manifests over time. Fan-favourite Rin is everything Asuka Langley should have been; bold and assertive without being obnoxious and snotty. Despite her confident manner and sharp tongue, she is a very likeable character. And of course there is Saber, Shirou's servant, who combines old-fashioned grace and femininity with ruthless fighting ability. While there are a couple of genuinely ""evil"" characters, the majority of the other Masters and Servants are simply antagonists because they stand against Shirou. Quite a few of the rival Servants are very memorable and likeable characters in their own right, such as Archer and Rider.

The anime combines many elements; obviously it is fantasy and action based but also includes some quite realistic drama. The series doesn't shy away from the fact that this a real War, and people die or suffer injuries during the battles. The more serious elements are offset by plenty of light-hearted comedic and romantic moments, plus some quite strong character development. There are also some obvious harem influences (Shirou had FIVE girls living in his house at one stage!), but there is very little if any fan service or cheesecake nudity. Apart from the obvious crush Sakura has on Shirou, the relationship Shirou has with the female leads are more friendly and platonic, so we're spared the silly sight of perfect girls pointlessly throwing themselves at the hero.

The art and animation are generally well-done, although it's a bit inconsistent in the character designs. The main females (Saber, Iliya, Sakura and especially Rin) are all beautiful and fluidly animated, whereas Shirou is a pretty basic design.  The battle scenes are well animated, with the different abilities of the Servants utilised to good effect.

In all,this is a fantastic series, and proof that you can make an anime that is both very familiar, but unique enough to be memorable. Well done Fate/stay night!",1277856000,,2731,5.066815144766147
8287640,4,B001CFQO20,"I can't really write a review for this item, only because I got it as a christmas gift for my brother. But I will comment on the fact that the box set arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape! Thanks will definitely do business with you again!",1265414400,,252,4.06
8287641,5,B001CFQO20,"I'm not sure what the 2-star review person is going on about. I'm a 20 year old female and I think this show rocks. XD This is the very first anime I ever watched, and it had me hooked from the very beginning. Which, given my short attention span, says something in and of itself. :P If any of the information in this review is off, I apologize, it's been about 2 years since I last saw it, hence the reason for me buying it again lol.

Pros:
Great artwork, epic fight scenes, both Japanese and English actors did a fantastic job. Each character has their own individual storyline, and their own issues. It's one of those shows where you can actually feel sorry for the bad guys. AMAZING soundtrack, Kenji Kawai is a freaking genius. To be perfectly honest, if I don't like the opening theme for an anime, it usually means I won't like the anime itself. I'm not sure why. But I loved the opening theme for Fate/Stay Night, and loved the rest of it as well.

Cons:
I thought there were too few episodes, so the end of the show seemed a little rushed and packed into a too tiny time frame. The relationship between Saber and Shirou was one of my favorite parts, and there was not enough effort put into that. Also the ending is slightly abrupt, and leaves you wanting more, which sucks because there is no more, unless Fate/Hollow Ataraxia is released in the US. (Hint hint! XD)

That's about all I can think of lol, I haven't seen this in about 2 years so I don't remember too terribly much. I'm really super excited to receive it in the mail and watch it again! Anyhow, great show, maybe not the BEST, but certainly worth watching. :)",1261699200,,1634,4.350819672131148
8287642,4,B001CFQO20,"The Japanese blu-ray of this collection has only been out for about 3 months. Unfortunately while it is region free the cost of importing the blu-ray is just around $320 (not including shipping), compared to the current (on sale) price of $38.49 for the domestic DVD collection. Also, there are /no/ English subtitles option with the Japanese blu-ray release. So for now it is still easily recommended to purchase this DVD collection. But for those who want to see this series in 720p resolution and English dub or sub it will require more patience as it may still be a much longer wait for Funimation to release the domestic blu-ray set. Hopefully it will be released at a much lower price than the current cost of importing.

Additionally note that this reviewed item is the 2009 re-priced version of the DVD collection. I am not sure if there are any major differences within the extras or content compared with the earlier DVD collection.",1248480000,,942,4.779141104294479
