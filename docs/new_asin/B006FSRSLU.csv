4985318,4,B006FSRSLU,I didn't read the label properly so when I got it I didn't know it was for someone with leg injuries. I gave the dvd to someone i thought could use it. I would buy from seller again and I recommend,1377475200,,197,3.8292682926829267
4985319,5,B006FSRSLU,"I recently came out of an orthopedic walking boot because I sprained my ankle badly.  My ankle is not strong enough to fully support  my weight for extended periods of time, so I started using this DVD.  I love Susan, she is fun in a qwirky way and she makes me smile.  This DVD consist of two 30 minute workouts and I like them both.  There is enough variety to make the workouts different.  The workouts require a band  which is included with the DVD.  This DVD is good for someone who is recovering from a lower body injury like myself or someone with joint problems.  Everything is done in a chair except on one of the workouts, there is a quick section where you try to stand or lift your butt from the chair while working your chest with the band.  I try to stand if my leg lets me, otherwise I sit and concentrate on my chest.  What you get from this DVD is great stretching exercises from your neck to your feet and also stretching and  exercises for your hands and fingers, You also do a fun cardio segment.  I really enjoy the resistance/strength training and you get to do a good number of reps.  I feel like I am training and rehabbing my body.  The video is great quality, the background is bright and colorful and the music is fantastic.",1371859200,36,1251,4.286324786324786
4985320,3,B006FSRSLU,I like Susan's upbeat attitude.  It keeps you goings I'm just disappointed that it doesn't go into more exercises on the one DVD.  I'd like it to do leg stretches too.,1366156800,3,167,4.354838709677419

4985325,4,B006FSRSLU,I have another Susan Tuttle DVD--I like her energy and the fairly fast pace of the exercises.  They do get my heart pumping.  This one has 2 workouts and a lot of variety within each session.,1464912000,,191,4.277777777777778
4985326,3,B006FSRSLU,My class was happy with the dvd. It was a bit slow for me. So it depends on what level of activity you want.,1454371200,,108,3.5416666666666665

4985328,5,B006FSRSLU,"I've read some bad/sad reviews on this.  This is a cd that was made to address everyone at every stage of exercise.  So it's a one size fits all.  After you learn the exercises you can turn down the sound and still follow along just fine.  I have been doing these exercises for a month now and have already lost 8 pounds.  You wouldn't think it would work but it does.  And as I say, any exercise is good exercise.  So go ahead and do something for yourself and get this CD.",1434844800,14,474,4.086956521739131

4985339,2,B006FSRSLU,"I bought this for RESISTANCE BAND training not a full workout and it's only got approximately 10 minutes per 30 minute workout of resistance band training. Also you can be ""perked to death"" by Susan Tuttle's forced smiles and perkiness! You can just tell that someone off camera keeps telling her to smile! Oh my goodness! I am looking for an alternative immediately! I guess if you can get past that and you want a full workout with no warm up or cool down phase this is the one for you. Otherwise save your money.",1408320000,11,515,4.431578947368421

8497187,4,B006FSRSLU,"I would've given 5 stars, but it took so long to receive it. However, the company resolved the issue quickly.
Once received, I was very happy with the dvd. The moves aren't too complicated, she addresses major body parts and I didn't wear myself out.
Also, Susan Tuttle is very personable and I found myself smiling along with her during the workout.
