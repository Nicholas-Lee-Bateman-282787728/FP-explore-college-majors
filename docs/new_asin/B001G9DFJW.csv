When Greg's voice started, my daughter stopped nursing and cocked her head to listen with a calm look on her face, as if she, too, was taking in the great information Greg provided for making your own baby food. I look forward to introducing my daughter to the wonderful world of healthy homemade food as she becomes ready for solids. I'll also be looking into purchasing a ricer to keep it simple. Love the philsophy that Life Happens At the Table!",1222992000,,528,4.510416666666667

Truly a gem, thank you Chef and Father!",1222992000,,255,4.163265306122449
