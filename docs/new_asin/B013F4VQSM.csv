7363308,1,B013F4VQSM,"I love the real Toy Story adventures as much as you do.  This is not one.  It is a feature-length commercial for some cheesy dinosaur toys that have nothing whatsoever to do with the Toy Story Universe.  For about the first twenty minutes of this shameful sell-out I thought that Pixar was doing a not very funny parody of  Disney-style commercialism.  Then it gradually dawned on me that, no, this is our beloved Pixar selling out.
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  But no, kids, there is no longer a Pixar if they will stoop to something like this.",1441670400,21,556,4.51
7363309,5,B013F4VQSM,"We had dvr'd this for our 4 year old granddaughter in December of '14 and she has watched it frequently since then.  It is thoroughly charming, with a certain depth about childhood play that all the Toy Story films have.  This one manages so much in a short.",1441152000,8,258,4.354166666666667

7363311,1,B013F4VQSM,"Pixar really jumped the shark on this one.
Although there are many toys in this blatantly made for tv cash grab complete dramatic fades for commercial breaks, this show (it is NOT a movie!!) is nothing more than a vehicle to sell more merchandise.

Show runs 20 minutes.",1440979200,9,270,4.625
7363312,2,B013F4VQSM,I so love the Toy Story gang but this was my least favorite of all their adventures poor plot and not something the whole family could enjoy> Maybe because it was released at Christmas time on T.V and was boring,1440806400,9,211,4.3

7363314,1,B013F4VQSM,My five year old was super excited to see a new Toy Story movie but he was extremely disappointed when he got less than half of what he expected.

I have NEVER been disappointed watching any of the Toy Story movies, and that is saying a lot since I usually despise sequels: they are usually made for profit and poorly put together.

7363348,4,B013F4VQSM,"Theyve reused the idea from the first film, creating a story about toys who don't realize they're toys.  Its up to Trixie the Triceratops to convince them that they are toys and have a greater purposeto serve children.  She has to do this before they sacrifice Woody and Buzz to the blades of a fan in the floor.

This was a Christmas TV special complete with blackouts where the commercials were interspersed.  At a mere 22 minutes, its not that involved.  Its cute enough but not all that clever when you consider how much time they spent in the first film trying to prove to Buzz that he was a toy, not a space man.  They did the same thing here in a lot less time.  This feels like a rough sketch, the bare bones of an idea not fully developed.  They especially did not make good use of Angel Kitty.  What was the point of introducing new characters then giving them little to do.",1504396800,,884,4.3090909090909095
7363349,1,B013F4VQSM,this is a short film even though it says its 55 minutes. do not be fooled. the rest of the time its about the director and how he recorded it.,1502582400,,142,3.7666666666666666

7363353,3,B013F4VQSM,"The best parts of this half hour were Buzz, Woody and Rex.  Trixie isn't my favorite TS character, and her ""romance"" with the action figure dinosaur just didn't hold my interest.  They should leave the romance to the TS power couple Buzz and Jessie.  The rest of the characters were a lot of fun.",1495238400,3,296,4.444444444444445
7363354,2,B013F4VQSM,It says it's like 50 minutes which it is but the movie itself is only 20-25 minutes and the rest is about the making of it.  My grandkids don't care.  I'm very disappointed! I would not have purchased had I known that.,1494892800,,218,4.166666666666667

My son can watch this over and over again in the same sitting (kindve sad but mom's gotta clean sometimes). If you liked the Toy Story trilogy, this is worth watching even though it is not as emotionally engaging as the original movies (not every movie needs to make me bawl my eyes out like the incinerator scene in Toy Story 3 for me to like them). I especially like the love song/video for Trixie included in the extras. Maybe I've got a weird sense of humor but it cracked me up.",1487894400,,574,4.275229357798165

And my daughter couldn't care less about that part.",1486339200,2,352,4.786885245901639
7363372,1,B013F4VQSM,Terrible!!!  My kids love all of the toy story movies.  This one is a short with the majority of the producers talking about their inspirations for this short video and how they made it.  Kids will be bored with it.,1486166400,,215,4.325

7363375,3,B013F4VQSM,"If you are expecting an epic adventure, you will be disappointed. It will appeal to most younger children. Older kids and adult fans of Toy Story will be greatly disappointed. New characters are not fully developed, the story line is weak and the overall advcenture is dull.",1485561600,2,274,4.851063829787234
7363376,1,B013F4VQSM,I too did not read the reviews.  Don't waste money for short 22 min video.  They need to fix the duration from 50 minutes. I would have never purchased.,1485388800,,152,4.206896551724138
7363377,3,B013F4VQSM,We used digital credit that we accrued over the holidays for most of the cost.  We ended up paying about $2 for it. That's probably what's it worth.  The actual story line is 20 minutes. You can see the interest fade in my son's eyes as soon as Steve Purcell comes on and starts talking during the bonus stuff.  However the boy will watch it over and over again so I'd purchase again.,1485388800,,384,4.232876712328767

7363387,3,B013F4VQSM,So the movie itself is great. The run time is shown as about an hour but the movie is actually only about 20 minutes. The rest is the animators taking. It's a little misleading.,1482710400,,177,4.235294117647059

I wrote Amazon customer service.  They are refunding me.  I suggest everyone ask for their money back.  Eventually, they will make the description truthful.  Run time: 15 minutes with another 30 minutes of stuff that your kids won't care for.  The 15 minute part was great, but not worth $10.",1482451200,,413,4.638888888888889

7363392,1,B013F4VQSM,Don't waste your money. This states it is 50 mins but really the sho is roughly 20 mins. The remaining time is spent by the creators taking about making the movie.,1482192000,,163,4.290322580645161

7363427,5,B013F4VQSM,"Toy Story That Time Forgot sure ain't like other Christmas classics many of us know and love, but it sure is definitely worth a shot, especially for action/adventure toy lovers, such as Bonnie's friend Mason, who's been given a huge collection of Battlesaurs (AND an Optimum X video game system) for Christmas in this instant holiday classic; in fact it takes place 2 days AFTER Christmas! Luckily, a special Christmas ornament named Angel Kitty reminds us this is a Christmas special, with her words of wisdom, and Trixie tries to set the Battlesaurs' leader Reptillus straight. Too bad they were a lot more delusional than Buzz used to be, thinking they're real warriors; that is until... well, see your yourselves, if you wish! The bonuses are sparse on DVD, just a short documentary & a commentary on the feature program, but the Blu-ray disc has a bunch of 'em, including the opening sequence of the made-up Battlesaurs TV series! Just as Santa Baby is a unique snowflake among Rankin/Bass' own Christmas classics, Toy Story That Time Forgot is the same for Disney's line of animated Christmas classics, only made by Pixar, and it debuted on ABC in December of 2014! If you like to add this to your Pixar collection, OR your holiday classics collection, go right ahead!  This and Toy Story of Terror for Halloween, will be truly worth the wait for Toy Story 4 in 2019! ""To Infinity And Beyond!"" as Buzz would say.",1475452800,,1418,4.764227642276423

Andrews Blu-ray Review: TOY STORY THAT TIME FORGOT [2015] is presented to audiences as a Christmas Special, the PIXAR animation film actually has little to do with Christmas at all, apart from the Angle Kitty decoration and Bonnies home being filled with Christmas decorations. The majority of this special gives us a look at the Battlesaurs, a fearsome fighting breed of dinosaur toys that have Trixie captivated.

Trixie the triceratops [Kristen Schaal] is overjoyed that, for the first time, shell be played with as a dinosaur, the very thing that she is. Unfortunately, just as little Bonnie [Emily Hahn] is about to pick up the underutilized reptilian, she opts for a Christmas teddy bear ornament instead, which actually is a cat angel. Shortly thereafter, Bonnie visits her pal Mason, who is too preoccupied with a new video game system to engage in make-believe with the items in her backpack: Woody [Tom Hanks], Buzz [Tim Allen], Rex [Wallace Shawn], Mr. Pricklepants [Timothy Dalton], and Mr. Potato Head [Don Rickles]. Seemingly abandoned for the afternoon, the unsupervised gang decides to interact with Masons enormous collection of Christmas gifts and the entire line of Battlesaurs figures.

Taking on an amusing Gladiator theme, featuring the Arena of Woe, mixed with Army Men militarism and an unending lust for warfare, TOY STORY THAT TIME FORGOT introduces numerous new characters, including warrior leader Reptillus Maximus [Kevin McKidd] and an evil pterodactyl The Cleric [Steve Purcell]. The fantasy realms of Battleopolis pits hardened soldiers, which have never been played with and don't realise they're toys, just like Buzz Lightyear in the first film, against a bevy of mirthful, unsuspecting creatures, like a sock monkey. And its up to the veteran toys to educate sheltered viewpoints.

Although this short PIXAR animation film, was originally airing as a TV programme in America in December 2014, that has plenty of motifs from the theatrical trilogy, including a harrowing sequence in which several of the main characters are threatened with impending doom, theres still moderate entertainment in seeing artistic takes on popular action figures getting their own quirky translations into animated personas. Of course, the PIXAR animation film continues to break a few of the same rules it has always toyed with, such as when an ornament comes to life, where the begging question we all ask as to what inanimate objects should be capable of taking on movement and self-awareness and when, after a group meeting, the toys are interrupted and drop where they are instead of where they were left. No new ground is traversed in this swift little episode, but the Battlesaurs are nevertheless a slick addition to the TOY STORY cast. Its worth a watch for all avid fans of PIXAR animation.

Overall, this PIXAR animation short is a really nice cuddly addition to the other TOY STORY franchise and it is totally fun to see the TOY STORY characters back on our screens. However, the story feels flat and trite, rehashing the same conflict Buzz encountered in the first film: toys not realizing they are toys. That being said I still enjoyed the wildly creative and fun Battlesaurs, from their 1990s rockin theme song to their overdeveloped action figure muscles. During the credits as Mason is sleeping, Reptillus says he looks forward to seeing Trixie again, next Tuesday, around 3:30.

Blu-ray Video Quality  PIXAR / Walt Disney Studios comes with an a stunning colourful 1080p HD encoded transfer image presented in an equally brilliant 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The video presentation looks like it was made for a wide release rather than just a run-of-the-mill straight to video release. The detail is highly sharp and vivid throughout. Every scuff mark and imperfection on these animated plastic toys is very impressive and can be seen clearly, making each object look fairly realistic. For Trixie and Maximus. Every plastic scale on Trixie and Rex looks great and has the plastic and leathery look. Background characters, mostly seen in the Battlesaurs fight also look excellent and never go soft. Colours are bright and simply pop off screen, plus all colours are well-balanced and saturated and even provide those different shades that would tell us which toys have been played with more often than not. Black levels are deep and inky as well. There was a small amount of banding, but it's very minor and not worth writing home about, leaving this video presentation with top marks.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  PIXAR / Walt Disney Studios presents us with three English soundtracks: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1, 5.1 DTS-HD High Resolution and 2.0 Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo surround. All are strong, solid tracks with the 7.1 offering, of course, the most sophisticated use of. There is some welcome directional dialogue though most of the dialogue appears in the centre channel with great clarity and conciseness. Michael Giacchinos delightful background score gets a nice spread through the front and rear channels. The score adds to the mood to each scene and never drowns out any of the sound effect and dialogue. Speaking of the dialogue, it's perfectly clear and easy to follow, and free of any pops, cracks, hiss, and high shrills. During the bigger action scenes here, the bass has a nice rumble to it as well is excellent and the dynamic range is very wide, leaving this short PIXAR animated film's audio element are top marks.

Audio Commentary: Director Steve Purcell and Story Supervisor Derek Thompson: Steve Purcell and Derek Thompson offer insightful information in discussing some intimate details about character definition, constructing story themes, outside inspirations, character and environmental design and visuals, and much more. They also explain the reason why they chose the outline for the start of the opening sequence for the animated film, especially bringing in the theme of the Christmas Festive Season theme. They talk about when Bonnie chucks the backpack into the other room, especially about the crash landing in the room with all the massive amounts of the boys toys, where they wanted to incorporate other genre films that the team are their favourites, like Planet of the Apes; Star Trek; At The Earths Core and the Ray Harryhausen prehistoric films and wanting the original toys to experience a different scenario and reality, as well as make Trixie feel wanted as a toy in this new world of Battlesaurs World and especially being welcomed into BATTLEOPOLIS. They also inform us that they had a lot of fun with Rex getting his giant pair of bionic arms and found it highly entertaining. When Trixie runs away towards the Canyon of Sacred Packaging and where Reptillus Maximus finds out he is really a toy. They say they favoured a lot of British actors voicing the other Battlesaurs toys, like you had with the film GLADATOR. They talk about how Bonnie is lured into trying out the video game, that really her heart is with the toys and much prefers to play with them and the bond that Bonnie feels for the toys. The filmmakers manage to cram in plenty of detail into a track necessarily condensed under the film's runtime constraints. But at the end they both say that they hope Reptillus Maximus and the Battlesaurs toys hope to meet the other toys in the very near future and especially another animated film they hope to produce in the very near future, which I hope so, and all in all it has been a very enjoyable audio commentary from Director Steve Purcell and Story Supervisor Derek Thompson.

Finally, TOY STORY THAT TIME FORGOT is essentially a snapshot from the Toy Story universe, that I found very fulfilling and the epic scenes gave you that wonderful nice, warm, familiar feeling that TOY STORY centres on that we have come to expect and is surrounded with plenty of totally hilarious funny bits and a few fine moments of action and mild peril. But most important it is a welcome addition to the 'TOY STORY' universe franchise, even if it's only just over twenty-two minutes long. Each character is back and funny as ever, and the story itself is hilarious, thrilling, and highly entertaining, while still relaying a heartfelt message that PIXAR animation films are well known for. The video and audio presentations are both top notch, and the extras are totally brilliant, with some bonus features for the young children as well. This excellent value for money for just over 21 minutes PIXAR film of TOY STORY THAT TIME FORGOT, comes with an excellent high pedigree! Highly Recommended!

It advertises that the movie is 50 minutes but in truth the movie is only about 20-25 minutes long. The other content is director commentary on scenes that did not make the cut.

How it immerses you in the world of the Battlesaurs while still telling you they are toys is brilliant! And the bonus features are amazing! Although I wish there were more. And they should have put some Toy Story Toons on there. Seriously though. If you love Toy Story, Action Figures, Or science fiction, BUY THIS!!!!",1452470400,3,545,4.618556701030927

The sound track was one of the main reasons I purchased this movie. The 7.1 Master Audio track is for lack of a better word WOW.
folks that dismiss this film as a money maker for Disney Pixar are correct. That why they are in business. To make money. But this short film didn't have to be put out at all. Frankly i'm glad they did. So for those of us that are Disney and Pixar fans and those that take the chance and try this film out will enjoy it for what it really is. A fun short film of the Toy Story World.

I feel very cheated. It is 100% ridiculous that they lure you in with the 50 minute run time, only for you to find that only 20 of it, less than half, is actually something you're child will enjoy. This is supposed to be a kid's thing... why is 30 of the 50 minutes dedicated to something as mature as ""this is what we did, here's some deleted scenes, this is why we did this, this is what we were planning on doing.."" and general things that the average kid isn't going to give two hoots about.

7363585,4,B013F4VQSM,"Disney and Pixar really aren't ready to let the Toy Story gang go.  Since the final film came out a few years back, weve been several shorts with the gang and two TV specials (not to mention confirmation that they are making a fourth movie).  Not that Im complaining since I love these characters myself.  Toy Story That Time Forgot is the second TV special, and fans of these characters will definitely want to watch it.

Its after Christmas, and Bonnie (Emily Hahn) is going on a playdate to her friend Masons (R. C. Cope) house.  Shes grab a few of her toys to take along, including Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and her two dinosaurs Trixie (Kristen Schall) and Rex (Wallace Shawn).  Trixie is currently frustrated because she is never cast as a dinosaur in Bonnies play.  In fact, she is currently a baby reindeer while other toys get to be the dinosaurs.

Mason got a cool new video game for Christmas, and he and Bonnie quickly get absorbed.  However, the toys discover that Mason also got a BattleSaurs play set complete with many action figures.  Trixie and Rex are excited to be making so many new dinosaur friends.  But danger is lurking for Woody and Buzz.  Will they survive this play date?

I watched this special when it first aired last year, and my initial impression was that it was a little dark.  Rewatching it this year, I found more of the comedy, although a couple of scenes might be too much for extremely sensitive children.  Its nothing worse than weve seen in the films, however.

We can pretty much guess where the plot is going early on, and it doesnt really break any new ground for the franchise, but thats okay because its plenty of fun.  There are laughs and memorable moments that fans of the series will enjoy.

It is a shame we don't get to see more of the regular gang.  They do have cameos at the beginning and end, but thats it.  However, this is just a half hour special.  There just wasn't room for the rest of the toys, especially when you consider the many new toys that we meet along the way.

The voice cast does a remarkable job bringing the characters to life.  You can tell they love these characters as much as we do.  The new cast jumps right in and fits perfectly into the story.  And while this may be a TV special, the animation looks great.

Fans of the Toy Story characters (and really, who isnt) will be glad they sat down to watch Toy Story that Time Forgot.  I think I will always enjoy checking in with these friends no matter what format the story takes.",1451606400,2,2521,4.423913043478261

7363612,4,B013F4VQSM,"This is one of my favorite Toy Story shorts. And, yes, as other reviews have stated, it is short - only 22 minutes. However, using the words of Reptillus Maximus, those 22 minutes are ""glorious."" This film introduces the Battlesaurs, a hilarious send-up of 80's cartoon awesomeness - gladiator dinosaurs who live for battle and glory. They even have their own metal-inspired theme song. There's also a new character, the somewhat creepy and mysterious Angel Kitty, a mostly silent character who occasionally pipes up with profound maxims that perfectly fit the situation (""Limitations are the shackles we bind to ourselves""). This short is super dark in places, but there are some big gut laughs and touching moments (you know, the typical Pixar film.) Like most Disney merchandise, the price is a little exorbitant, but I must say, my 2 children (aged 4 and 6) and I cannot get enough of this. We've watched it probably 15 times since it's home video release. If you're willing to pay a little extra, I'm betting that you'll get your money's worth from all of the repeat viewings. I know I did. (Note - I did dock one star for it being overpriced.

WOW!  Jeff H. and I wanted a complete Battlesaurs Play set after watching ""Toy Story That Time Forgot"" - which plays delightful homage to the old Saturday morning cartoon shows based on the latest and greatest toy set of the moment - in this case Battlesaurs!
Trixie the Triceratops is the star of this Toy Story tale.  She yearns to for Bonnie to let her be an actual dinosaur instead of a make-believe reindeer with homemade antlers. It's only when Bonnie takes her, Woody, Buz, and a few other of her friends over on a play date to a friend's house, does Trixie rediscovers for herself that Bonnie's love for her is a real and binding force, no matter what form imagination may give her.  Oh yes, and Trixie does - spoiler alert - get a boyfriend in the end.

It is evident that they were focusing on her to introduce and attempt to rise her to be as important as all the others, but let's be honest that will never happen. As a result the endearing characters (Woody and Buzz) have very little dialog or place in this story and was a stretch to have them there at all. This one has been my least favorite.

7363684,1,B013F4VQSM,"Honestly I think its OK at best, but as far as entries in the Toy Story line up this one is near the bottom for story quality. The reason that I am scoring it so low is because it is overpriced for a 22-minute special, and I saw it when it aired on TV so I know it is only 22 minutes.

As far as the story goes, it has a lot of the plot elements as Toy Story where Buzz, Woody, Rex, and the new Triceratops toy meet a bunch of Dinosaur warrior toys that think they really are Dinosaurs and don't know that they are toys. Of course they figure out the truth by the end.

Not bad but really a pale shadow of Toy Story as it lacks the same emotional investment and struggle that Woody and Buzz had to go through.

Though if you want to see toys fighting toys this may be up your alley, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.",1448150400,,818,3.9156626506024095

With a play time of 50 minutes we realized that it was not a full length feature film but we expected 50 minutes of family entertainment. Instead what we got was a fifteen minute short with a 35 minute documentary about how it was made. The short itself is mediocre. The only good thing that I could say about it is that the cast is the cast from the movies. Other than that it alone would deserve 3 stars at a price point of $2 for being average and watchable. The other 35 minutes were a waste of time and money. We were very disappointed.,1448064000,2,586,4.149122807017544

7363698,4,B013F4VQSM,"Full review at Metal Arcade.net

Just in time for Christmas, Disney and Pixar have released Toy Story That Time Forgot, a holiday TV special that originally aired about a year ago. Featuring a fun and action-packed journey into the land of the fearsome Battlesaur toys, the special shines on Blu-ray with gorgeous picture quality, interesting extras and vocal performances by all of the original actors, including Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, Kristen Schaal, Timothy Dalton, and Joan Cusack.

In Toy Story That Time Forgot, the story picks up just after Christmas as Bonnie is driven to a playdate with her buddy Mason. Mason just got a cool new video game system and is neglecting the awesome, enormous action figure playset he just received featuring the reptilian warriors called Battlesaurs. Bonnie chucks her backpack full of toys into the hallway, and picks up a controller next to Mason. Since neither party seems interested in playtime with Woody and his pals, they decide to check out Masons room, stumbling into the incredible world of Reptillus Maximus and his ferocious Battlesaur compatriots. While Trixie and Reptillus quickly take a liking to each other, it becomes clear that he and his fellow Battlesaurs don't understand that they are toys. This becomes problematic when Trixies pals end up fighting against Reptillus in the gladiator arena, as decreed by the decrepit, evil old leader whos keeping the fearsome reptilian army in the dark.

While Toy Story That Time Forgot has a runtime of just 22 minutes, Pixar didn't go light on the extras. In fact, this short has more features than some feature film Blu-rays Ive reviewed recently. Reptillus! gives an inside look at the development of the film, the voice recording sessions, and a ridiculously detailed synopsis of the vast backstory that was created for the Battlesaurs. Theres also a commentary track, a Comic-Con feature, a karaoke track, deleted scenes, and perhaps best of all, the 2D animated opening sequence for the Battlesaurs TV show. This was created for a deleted scene (why this was deleted remains a mystery to me), but is shown in the storyboards. The song is fantastic and the intro hit me with a wave of 1980s nostalgia; I wanted to instantly run to the store and buy all the Battlesaurs toys that don't actually exist. For the record, I would totally watch a Battlesaurs cartoon. Every. Saturday. I know Im not alone!

If you're a fan of Toy Story or Pixar films in general (and if you're not, I don't want to hang out with you), Toy Story That Time Forgot is a must-own Blu-ray. The film may be short but it is something that is totally worth rewatching, with great humor and a heartwarming if familiar story.",1447891200,,2696,4.892778993435448

While I understand that, it is misleading to give the actual film such a low rating.  Also, a lot of complaints are about the fact that it is $9.99 for a ""short"" film.  I consider a ""short"" film to be something like Frozen Fever or Mike's New Car - roughly 6-7 minutes long.  This was a full blown TV Special, and much more involved and detailed than a short film.  I think the $9.99 is about right.  Anyway - just wanted to try and offset some of the 1-star reviews, when the actual 22 minute film is VERY good and well done.",1447891200,3,639,4.154471544715447

7363736,5,B013F4VQSM,"In their second made for television special, the Toy Story gang returns during the Christmas season when Molly visits her cousin and brings her toys along for the fun. Once there, she gets distracted by her cousin's new video game system, and the toys go off to explore on their own. They discover an entire playset of advanced dinosaur warrior toys with high tech weapon attachments and an arena for battle. Triceratops toy Trixie is particularly fascinated by their new friends, who, as was once the case with Buzz Lightyear, don't realize they are merely toys and not living on some alien planet somewhere. Things seem great for a while, as Trixie becomes very close to a high ranking Battlesaur (as they're called) named Reptillus Maximus. Reptillus is good-hearted and curious, and equally fascinated by Trixie and her outlook on things. However, Battlesaur leader The Cleric is not happy with these newcomers and knows more about the nature of things than he's been sharing with his followers, eventually landing Trixie's friends, Woody, Buzz and the rest, in the battle arena themselves!

Okay, I'm gonna address this television special first, and then the Blu-Ray release itself, which is getting some even more complaints than the previous Toy Story TV special release for the same frustrating reasons. But, like I said, first, the special itself is excellent. As with Toy Story of Terror, and perhaps even moreso, Toy Story That Time Forgot looks gorgeous, completely Toy Story theatrical quality, and I think it's story even outdoes its excellent predecessor, Toy Story of Terror. This is more of an epic story, so in that sense really, it's just a different type of story, but one that gives off a natural sense of, well, being more of a big deal, while the other special seemed more like a cute little adventure. It focuses mostly on Trixie's experiences (not a ton of screentime for the classic gang this time, though some, but mostly Rex, as this is a very dinosaur-centric story), but I think that kinda works in this special's favor, as we are getting to know one of Molly's toys better, in addition to getting to know these other toys through her. It's a fascinating experience, and it's also a bit of a romance, which we haven't seen before in Toy Story in this way. Yah, Rexie shippers may be a bit disappointed, ha. This featurette, in my opinion, does an amazing job pacing itself to seem like a much longer story than it is, and I mean that in a good way. It's another 22 minute special, but through the course of it, it feels like you got a lot more story than you did in Toy Story of Terror, which was also an excellent special in its own way. This really feels like an epic story. My only complaint about it is similar to my single complaint about Toy Story of Terror, and actually to a lesser extent. That complaint is that this is meant to be a Christmas special, but once again, the PIXAR folks really didn't want to do a holiday special, or so it seems. This sort of thing is a pet peeve of mine and very disappointing for me. However, they do a better job here by at least having a bit of Christmas at the beginning and end, and having the plot be about these new toys being new Christmas toys (but that could have been done anytime as a birthday present thing). Incidentally, this kid is filthy rich or something! He had one heck of a Christmas! But, I digress. There is also a new little Angel Kitty Christmas ornament who tags along with the gang throughout the special and works as a cute reminder that this is a Christmas special. She's cute and funny, and even a bit creepy, as she seems to be in her own world except when she states very ""holiday spirit"" tidbits of advice, like the stuff you might read in a fortune cookie that is disappointingly not a prediction. So, yeah, they did a better job including the holiday than Toy Story of Terror did, but I still don't understand why they don't want to go full on with the holiday theme. Are the folks at PIXAR just not fans of holidays? No idea, but I think a lot could be done with these characters in stories that focus ON the holidays too, and I think they'd be real crowd pleasers. Regardless, this is another fantastic special that I think is even a bit better than the previous one, though I think a lot of people who disagree just don't like the lack of focus on Buzz and Woody. Oh well. Reminds me of how the excellent Halloween 3 received a bad reception for not being about Michael Myers, so we ended up with a bunch of inferior sequels after that one. So, those are my thoughts on the special itself. Fantastic stuff that lives up to the Toy Story name. Fully feature quality, but I do wish they'd do some holiday specials that actually focused on the holiday sometime too.

How about the Blu-Ray though? What is everyone complaining about? Simple. They're stupidly buying something without researching or even taking a look at what they're buying at all. They're complaining that a Disney Blu-Ray (with digital copy) is costing them 14.92 (I caught this on sale and paid a bit less, but even still), yet only runs about 22 minutes. They're also complaining that it has behind the scenes features! What?! Oh my god, what is wrong with you people?!!!

Okay, first, if you ever have bought Disney blu-rays, you know it's pretty amazing to find any for less than 19.99 outside of release week. There have been some changes in this recently, granted, with some of the less popular classics getting big price drops, but that's mainly because most people who want them already have them. For the most part, getting a Disney blu-ray of a half-hour TV special, well, anything under 15 bucks sounds about right, and Suggested Retail Price is still probably 19.99 (as for the features, the SRP is much higher). If you still wanna complain that it's not worth it, well, you really have no excuse to, because the info is all right on the package. Look, if you're just looking for a babysitter rather than high def, great quality programming adults and kids both can enjoy together (and yes, you're paying partly for the beautiful, theatrical quality of this original special over some cheap DVD of low budget TV show episodes randomly mashed together in a themed volume), then may I direct you to the 5 dollar DVD section? Beautifully made featurettes with excellent bonus features are clearly not for you. Reading some of the negative reviews on here have me totally disgusted and thinking, ""So, you folks are the problem? The reason we hardly get any good bonus features anymore, and so many releases are practically bare bones or have very superficial bonus features!"" I was so happy to see the bonus features on these specials! This is what DVDs and Blu-Rays were meant for! If you're not a true fan and collector, the right thing for you is the digital download. We real fans want those behind the scenes featurettes, commentaries and deleted scenes! The bonus features on Toy Story of Terror really go above and beyond, especially for a television special release, but the bonus features on Toy Story That Time Forgot or not slacking either. Sure, there are more behind the scenes focused bonus features here and less purely entertainment-based ones, but it's still fantastic stuff.

I will cut the Amazon customers some slack on this particular Toy Story special though, as it IS falsely labeled on Amazon as being 45 minutes in runtime, which is not correct in regards to the feature attraction. This is a big fail on Amazon's part and needs to be addressed. If you specifically bought this on Amazon, fair enough, you're off my itch-list. If you bought this anywhere else though, why can't you read the back of a package before buying something? If you can't, you have no right to complain. And this high quality of a program is still worth the money at under 15 if you know the market it's released in. Disney animation doesn't sell cheap, especially computer animated. Rare exception being Mars Needs Moms because it was a titanic flop. Even I haven't seen that one. It just looked so... ugly. These Toy Story films though, they all look beautiful and completely live up to their name!

Toy Story That Time Forgot includes deleted scenes, a great behind the scenes featurette, a comic con featurette, a very cool, fake, animated TV show intro for the Battlesaurs, a Karaoke video for a song Rex sings about Trixie (My Unexpected Friend, which is slightly reminscent of the Sting song from Emperor's New Groove, My Funny Friend and Me, but... funnier), and a commentary track for the main attraction as well! I could even have left something out there. This is one fantastic release and well worth the price! I'm puzzled anyone would buy something like this with no idea what they were buying. Why would anyone buy any Blu-Ray or DVD without reading the back of the packaging even a little bit? Especially if they were careful with their money enough to feel horribly cheated so easily. We even used to read the backs of the boxes before we rented a movie, let alone purchasing one! Not worth the money? No way! This Blu-Ray is a fantastic package of superb material! Disney and Pixar at their best! If you don't research an item first, especially these days that we have all the information we could want right at our fingertips, then complaining is just absurd. Granted, Amazon needs to correct their runtime information, but it's still worth it.",1446940800,7,9445,4.660071942446043

Anyway, if you are a fan of the franchise and want to have this entry no matter the cost, you won't be disappointed. The production value is at the expected high level, you will hear all your favorite voice actors here (including Tom Hanks and Tim Allen) and will be introduced to some new fun characters as well.
