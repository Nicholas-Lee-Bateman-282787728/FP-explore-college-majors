7896287,5,6305836760,"If you're a Rick Wakeman fan, this video is well worth having in your collection.  It has a few different pieces than seen on his other videos including Gershwin's summertime which is worth the price of the DVD in itself.  There's a great version of Arthur and Sea Horses as well.  It is short, running only about 45 which is the only drawback, but still well worth having.",1376870400,,373,4.455882352941177
7896288,4,6305836760,Spectacular performance from a genuine maestro.  The recital style of this concert was geared toward true appreciation of such rare brilliant talent.  Mr. Wakeman's ancedotal chats provided entertaining background to some of the songs and past tours.  The only complaint I have is there should have been more material included in this fantastic performance.,984009600,5,357,5.574074074074074
7896289,4,6305836760,"An excellent 52 mins worth of Rick, although would rather have paid more and had more songs. Nonetheless good value for money if you are a true Rick Wakeman fan. Eleanor Rigby by far the best track, Ricks anecdotal ease also  added to the enjoyment.",964569600,4,249,4.533333333333333
7896290,3,6305836760,"As a keyboardist who group up on Tony Banks (Genesis), Rick Wakeman (Yes), and Keith Emerson (ELP), I of course relished the chance to listen and critic this DVD. I already own Rick's other DVD ""Rick Wakeman  Live"" and I have to say it is better. This DVD has some wonderful  songs, but not enough of them (only 7 total). You can tell that the concert  contained many more songs but were edited out. Rick of course was great,  but it could have had some more songs. The sound (5.1) was good, but not  stupendous. The video was good and definitely provided some good shots of  Wakeman. Elenor Rigby was the best song showing Wakeman's dexterity and  creativity. In conclusion, if you are a serious fan, you must have this for  your collection. If you are mildly interested, you can get by without it  and buy ""Rick Wakeman Live"" instead.",959040000,25,836,4.52
