Nice to have Mr. Manilow living in our home town.",1227398400,7,230,4.560975609756097
3491138,5,B001BEK8B0,"To be honest, I hadn't expected much that the concert would be enjoyable. I bought this blu-ray anyway because I wanted some new music experiences in hi-def. After watching, I was so impressed by Manilow's musicianship, showmanship, and his passion towards music. Despite of his aging, his performance is flawless and very entertaining. He knows what audience wants from a concert! He sings most his hits including Mandy, Copacabana, One voice, I write the songs, etc. I wished he'd sung Ships. The concert was well prepared and features an orchestra. I already saw this blu-ray a couple of times and I'm sure this will be one of my all time favorites.

The PQ is excellent with AVC coding on my Samsung LCD TV even though it's in 1080i. The DTS-HD MA audio track is stunning. No extras.",1221696000,17,787,4.744525547445256

The reason to buy concerts in blu ray is cause of picture and sound quality. I would not recommend it to someone that is into quality like me.,1330214400,,307,4.482142857142857
3491146,5,B001BEK8B0,"""Barry Manilow: Manilow Live!"" is an excellent concert.  It's top-notch in both performance and enjoyability.  This is my first Manilow video, but I was familiar with quite a few of his songs from the radio.  There's a long set list of other songs too.

Mr. Manilow is so enthusiastic and more than willing to interact with the audience.  The ""duet"" or sing a long with the excited and happy lady from the audience is so touching and heart-wrenching. Her personal story is sweet and sad, at the same time.  If you are a Barry Manilow fan, you should get this Blu-ray or if you know very little about Mr. Manilow, (like me), and want an exciting concert experience, get this disc.  Mr. Manilow's voice and the band's instruments are great.",1314748800,,738,4.630769230769231

3491150,5,B001BEK8B0,"After 30+ years in the music business, Manilow still sounds and looks better than ever on this BD. This concert was recorded in Nashville, TN in 2001. Manilow obviously spared no expense on this concert. It includes a 30 piece orchestra, along with the musicians who travel with him and they sound great in Dolby Digital 5.1!

Manilow's signature songs are all included on this BD including ""I Write the Songs"", ""Mandy"", ""I Made it Through the Rain"", plus he does a special tribute to Frank Sinatra with ""That's Life"", ""Chicago"", and a few others. One of my favorites on this BD is his opening number ""Could This Be Magic"". One might question whether this is a good opening number for a concert since the original version could be considered slow and sappy. Not so with this version. He starts it out with a bigger than life entrance with the chorus and then builds it up to an up-tempo version (kind of disco-like). It actually comes out sounding awesome with a great groove! The audience was obviously loving it!

If you have a blu-ray player, get the blu-ray version. It looks and sounds great! Otherwise, go with the DVD. Either way, you can't go wrong on this one!",1275436800,,1169,4.615384615384615
3491151,5,B001BEK8B0,"Friends,

As an accomplished professional pianist, and one who owns the top 100 or so concert blu-rays that are for sale on Amazon's website, I can say, unequivocally, that if this DVD will not put you in a ""happy place"" there is utterly nothing that will.  I run a top of the line home theater in my basement, and the sound and picture of this remarkable concert are second to none.  Barry's many years of paying his dues in lesser paying gigs have brought him to this point - an utterly honed, ice-in-the-veins, polished performer.  His vocal chops, piano technique, stories, engagement with the audience and his orchestra, deliver a second to none performance worthy of being on EVERY musician's DVD-shelf in addition to the non-musician music lover.  The crisp visuals of Barry's expressions, the falsetto of the voice, the unbridled happiness and positivity of all of these tunes provide a performance that you will watch over, and over, and over - by yourself, with tears in your eyes, and with friends - with tears in all of our eyes.  The Sinatra section is dazzling, with a particularly touching performance of ""When October Goes"" - Barry's music set to the incredible lyrics of Johnny Mercer.  If that tune does not bring nostalgic tears to your eyes, I don't know what will.  Hits like ""Even Now"" make one think back on every relationship that one has had in younger years - whether the relationship had painful points or not.  The audience reveres in his wonderful story telling - from the buzzing electricity of Manhatten to his grandfather trying to coax a song out of him at a 25-cent recording-jukebox in Brooklyn, with Barry balking and crying about doing it.  They actually play the recording of this nostalgia, with his Brooklyn-thick-accented grandfather trying to get Barry to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to his cousin when Barry is a wee-lad.  You can see a picture of this event in his wonderful biography:  ""Sweet Life.""  ""Can't Smile Without You"" - one of his standards, is infinitely touching and heartfelt, with a sincere lady-fan (Michelle) from Arkansas, being the lucky one helping him, tearfully, through the duet.  Mr. Manilow is the definition of showmanship - happy, positive, a million hits, and one who truly can engage his audience.",1272672000,3,2263,4.890052356020942
3491152,4,B001BEK8B0,"I like Manilow music, so I like this Blu-ray.  This is not an one-time listening disc and enjoy watching is once in a while.",1262304000,,124,4.166666666666667

3491154,5,B001BEK8B0,"The Best of All Manilow DVD Concerts

I own many if not all of Barry's DVD concerts and I think this concert is the best for these reasons:

1) He pulled out all the stops, reached into his bank account, and hired a full orchestra to accompany him. The sound is much better than the usual machine-based musicians who accompany him. Barry obviously wanted this to be a special night that he would put in the time vault, and I'm glad he did;

2) This was the most personal of his concerts. In many concerts, the performers play song after song with some brief chit-chat in between. It gets a little predictable sometimes and you tend to tune out. But Barry includes some backstory and a few personal touches that give you a sense of his life and career, and that gave the experience more depth.

For example, he includes an old 75 rpm recording of when his grandfather tried to encourage him to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to his little cousin at one of those cheap recording booths in New York City when he was around 9 years old. It was really cute the way the then-shy Barry refused to sing. It apparently sparked Barry's love for music, and ""This One's For You"" was heartwarmingly dedicated to his grandfather;

3) The song list was the most comprehensive and personal for hard core Manilow fans. There's everthing here: his biggest hits, as well as some Broadway show tunes, some Sinatra, some Latin rhythmns (Copacabana). I don't really like the latter type of songs, but Barry does them in his unique style that makes them enjoyable for me anyway. I'm sure this is one of the reasons why he's widely known as the greatest showman in music.

I would have to agree. His love of Broadway musicals obviously influenced his musical writing, and you can hear the build-up of his songs toward the final resolution just as you would watch the build-up of a play towards the third act resolution. By the end, he finally hits the payoff and you leap up onto your feet with rousing applause at the third-act climax.

On another occasion, Barry revealed his love for odd musical instruments. He did some funny bits with an accordion and another funny-sounding instrument. It was good for some comic relief while bopping along with some silly but catchy tunes.

What I really appreciated was his including his lesser-known but more personal songs, like the beautiful ""When October Goes"" and ""I Am Your Child"". These types of songs aren't usually included in his more commercial concerts for more casual fans, and I'm glad they were included here. His music is unique in that it is for lovers, not fighters, and I'm glad he gave us a little extra something to make us happier this time around. That was not always the case.

In the late 1970's when I was in high school, Barry was in and so was the ""Sensitive Male"", as portrayed by men like Alan Alda and Phil Donahue. Around the late 1980's, our society started to change and adopt a more ""Gordon Gekko"" type of personna which resulted in a big backlash against sensitivity. Alan Alda eventually took on villanous roles. Donahue couldn't find another gig anywhere while Jerry Springer flourished. And the Chicago White Sox hosted an evening where they burned Manilow's albums at their stadium during a game. It was like a Hitler book burning.

Manilow admitted that he went into hiding and then into therapy during that time to deal with all the negativity. Who can blame him--first they loved him and then they hated him. The people who have a chic dislike for Manilow feel that way because they are insecure about their masculinity. It makes them feel more like men to say ""I'm a fighter, not a lover"", like when their heroes bite the heads off bats onstage. That's surely why out of all his hits, the only one to win a Grammy was ""Copacabana"" - a song that would not tread near the dangerous waters of intimacy.

I always stuck with Manilow and his music throughout those lean years and I'm glad he made it to meet his loyal fans on the other side. Yes, Barry, it was them, not you. Manilow is probably the only artist out there who can give us a night of class, elegance, and heartfelt romance when we are sorely in need of it. And Barry - if you're ever in San Franciso, drop me a line so Chef Ted can say thanks with a great 5-course, 5- star dinner!",1255910400,7,4293,4.540750323415265

3491156,5,B001BEK8B0,"I've been passing over this DVD for months because I am not a Barry Manilow fan.  His music always seemed over played and overrated to me.  But I decided to give it a chance and am so glad I did.

Of course the blu-ray video is outstanding, but it was the performance that got my attention.  This artist has alot of charisma, energy and way of interacting with the audience with that makes it a joy to watch.
 The arrangements with live orchestra make it really special.  It's not a studio sound - more casual, soothing and beautiful.  The concert has so many songs I never heard and many I had forgotten.
  Barry still looks great although his voice seems to have less spark.  After all these years he's still an amazing entertainer!  I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD concert.",1245196800,3,773,4.489208633093525

8283004,5,B001BEK8B0,"For those who like Manilow, this Blu-Ray disk contains a wonderful and entertaining concert that is sure to please.  The sound and picture quality are both excellent.  Barry's energetic stage presence keeps this musical wonderland of hits moving along briskly.  He has so many hits that it would take a 5-hour concert to showcase them all, yet, Barry takes his greatest hits and plays the main melody and lyrics in an abbreviated manner.  (If you desire to hear the entire songs from beginning to ending, then purchase the original recordings).

This is a delightful collection of Barry's greatest hits and more.  It will satisfy all Manilow fans and will also appeal to those who have never heard of him (where have these people been hiding out?!)  The concert is lots of fun, with many costume changes and different sets.  The Copacabana  presentation was really terrific.

Manilow's voice is pretty good, not perfect, but then again, this is a live concert, not studio sound.  One can also listen to his commentary of the concert as well, which is fun too.

I'm glad I purchased it.

I loved all the songs he sang, except the 2 Frank Sinatra songs.  They're OK if & when Frank sang them, but Barry's a different kind of singer. Loved ""When October Goes and Weekend in New England, the two songs that the late Johnny Mercer's wife gave Barry M. to write music for J. Mercer's lyrics.  He wrote beautiful music to those songs.  One of my favorite Manilow songs is ""Could it be Magic and has been since I first heard it. My daughter brought it home one day and I fell in love with it. I'd never heard it played, and sang ""up"" as it was in the beginning of the show, and I had mixed feelings about that, but after I heard it a few times, I liked the up rhythm too.  I sang and played it at my little granddaughter's birthday party.  Two of the songs I really enjoyed were ""All the Time"" and New York City Rhythm.  I also loved the two songs he sang from Harmony.  I hope one day that project will be done, and his musical will be played in NY or DC.",1395273600,,1112,4.041095890410959
