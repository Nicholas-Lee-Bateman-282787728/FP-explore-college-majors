6931723,5,B00RI5KD5C,Great!,1475193600,,6,6.0
6931724,1,B00RI5KD5C,"This first season of the show, does not work in the USA or Canada",1475020800,,65,3.7142857142857144
6931725,3,B00RI5KD5C,"This was an outstanding series, and the availability of all four seasons would be very welcome (5 stars). However, the physical product is radically defective (1 star). Some disks or portions of disks are simply unplayable, despite repeated efforts. The manufacturer seems to have been aware of  problems. The box says, in very small print, ""Layer changes on this disc may cause some models of DVD player to interrupt the program."" That's a gross understatement, but it's more warning than Amazon.com has given its customers on its webpage. Amazon should be ashamed of marketing such a defective product.",1473552000,14,604,5.163265306122449
6931726,5,B00RI5KD5C,"This show is so great.  The Dvd's are good, not perfect, but well worth the investment",1472688000,,86,4.375
6931727,4,B00RI5KD5C,"While the Season 1 DVD released in the USA is remastered from the original film, this set from Australia is a mish mash -- Season 1 & 2 are remastered versions, but then converted to PAL format video. Season 3 & 4 are not remastered, and are taken from a PAL video source rather than film.

The picture size is odd. The episodes are at PAL frame rate - 25fps - which means that they run a little fast and the audio is fast. It has those drawbacks of PAL, but without the benefit of the higher 576i resolution: these are at NTSC (480i) resolution. None of the episodes is mastered to DVD from film, they are first telecined (from 24fps film, to 30fps interlaced video, then to 25fps video). And for some reason, a couple seasons are presented as 16x9 with the 4x3 picture in the center -- burned-in pillar boxing.

As these are taken from the video masters, the quality is not super high. They're equivalent to what you'd see on TV as opposed to what you expect from a DVD. There are no captions and no Surround Sound.

Still, this is the only complete series offering I've found, so there's little choice!",1472601600,26,1105,4.380487804878049
6931728,5,B00RI5KD5C,"Finally!!!!!  I have waited for the complete series that could be viewed on standard UNITED STATES DVD players!!  I already purchased season one, but it was cheaper to buy the complete series than each season separately.  I just picked this up at the post office,  so I have yet to watch any of them, however, I'm just ecstatic that the wait is over!!!  Picket Fences was one of my all time favorite TV shows of the 1990's.  It's a shame it didn't last longer!!!  The day I purchased mine, they were $79.99, I see that it has already went up to $89.99....don't wait any longer to buy the set!!!",1471478400,3,594,4.394495412844036
6931729,4,B00RI5KD5C,"These DVDs are in 4:3 format so you'll have to fiddle with your TV settings to get a proper picture - at first season 2 was cropping the top and bottom on my picture until I got it into panoramic setting and it gave me a letterbox picture.  Season 3 is a different story because I am not getting that same letterbox picture on the same panoramic setting.  The quality of the picture obviously was not a priority with screen size presentations varying between discs - I wonder where the discs were done because the printing says ""Seasons X Disc XX,"" like they were recorded/printed in a non English speaking country.

I found it disappointing that the fourth season's ending episodes were compiled by their original airdate order instead of a logical order, with the series finale (Three Weddings and a Meltdown) followed by four more episodes on a separate disc.

Two stars for the discs, five stars for the program.

""Relive all the heartfelt episodes of this unforgettable series, available for the first time in this 24 disc collection. This multiple Emmy award winning series from creator David E. Kelly (Ally Mcbeal, Boston Legal) is a remarkable blend of quirky humor and heart-warming storytelling. With an ensemble case including Tom Skerritt (Alien), Kayth baker (The Cider House Rules) and Lauren Holly (NCIS), Picket Fences follows the lives of the people of the small town of Rome, Wisconsin where weird things happen and everybody knows everyone else's business - or at least they thing they do! ""  WOW - check out all the misspellings, typos and wrong words used in this editorial review (written by God knows by who - probably the same persons who wrote ""Seasons 3 Disc 3"" etc.)

UPDATE - on a sad note, Fyvush Finkel passed on August 14th, 2016, at the age of 93.",1471305600,14,1779,4.737864077669903
6931730,5,B00RI5KD5C,"This is one of the greatest and more underrated series of all time. What other show has multiple dead bodies in freezers, cows giving birth to babies, a deaf dancing bandit that becomes the mayor of town, the best lawyer ever (Wambaugh). Don Cheadle as another amazing lawyer, and a judge that is incredible to watch each and ever time. Thank you for finally releasing this amazing show! It is David E Kelley's greatest masterpiece, and it took 9 nine years to get the entire series after season 1 was released in 2007. It's about time, but better late than never.",1471219200,11,564,4.594059405940594
6931731,5,B00RI5KD5C,"For everyone who has had season one for over 8 years like me and live in America, this is the set for you. It has all four seasons that is playable on any DVD, gaming system, etc. I am so excited to finally see season 2 to 4 and for as long as we have waited- the price is worth it.",1469923200,5,282,3.639344262295082
6931732,5,B00RI5KD5C,"Oh for heaven's sake!  When will the powers-that-be come to their senses and release the rest of the seasons for this show?  It's simpley THE GREATEST SHOW EVER ON COMMERCIAL T.V.!  (Except for the final season, the less said about which the better.)

But no, here in the U.S. all we can get is Season one.  Who do we have to kill?  Who's family do we have to hold hostage, TO GET SEASONS 2 & 3!

(And no, the ""won't-play-on-U.S.-machines"" version ISN'T an acceptable alternative!)

Anyone know what's going on with this?  Why can't we get this in a version playable in the U.S.?",1437955200,5,579,4.490384615384615

8695371,1,B00RI5KD5C,only able to watch 2 episodes per disk missing about 2-3 episodes per disk,1486857600,,74,4.357142857142857
8695372,1,B00RI5KD5C,More than half of them won't play!!  Was issued refund,1483228800,,54,4.4
8695373,4,B00RI5KD5C,"There seems to be  US/ Region 1 set and an Australian set. Has anyone viewed the Aussie set? Reading the US version blows, I would like to know if the other was better in it's production ( I have a multi-regional BR)",1482796800,,216,4.142857142857143
8695374,4,B00RI5KD5C,"The show is really great -- I'm happy that it has finally been released on DVD.  The downsides:  no closed captioning, no extras, the aspect ratio is off beginning on the last disc of season three.  Overall, a great show, but an overpriced product, especially for a product that doesn't reflect much effort or care from distribution.",1482192000,,333,4.807017543859649
8695375,3,B00RI5KD5C,"I absolutely LOVE this series!!  Was going to buy the whole set, but after reading that the seasons are not all remastered and formatted to a consistent DVD quality level, I will wait for a better set to come out.  If this is a keeper, I want to spend my money on quality!  (and what's up with ""Region: all regions""?  Does that mean the discs will work everywhere, or a variety of discs are available and you need to specify upon ordering?)",1479340800,,440,4.329268292682927

8695378,2,B00RI5KD5C,"Great show for the family which deserves 5+ stars.  But some of these disks are poorly formatted.  Season 3 disk 6 suddenly goes into a zoom-like mode cropping the edges and there is no way to overcome this. I've tried resizing and changing the aspect ratio to no avail.  Also, the picture suddenly goes out of focus from time to time.  For $90.00 this should not happen.",1475884800,7,371,4.492537313432836
8695379,5,B00RI5KD5C,Enjoyed the TV Show and this complete box set is just what I have been looking for. The shipment came timely and undamaged. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thanks,1475539200,,166,4.387096774193548
