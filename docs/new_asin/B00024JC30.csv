Theres basically NOTHING going on but what's his name and what's her name going out, and ita a horrible date! DONT BUY IT, DONT RENT IT, STAY AWAY EVEN IF YOURE A DIE HARD FAN OF OWEN WILSON OR MORGAN FREEMAN!!!",1095552000,2,338,4.2153846153846155
2062206,2,B00024JC30,"I like Elmore Leonard novels. I like some of the movies based on his books, like ""Get Shorty."" This movie has charming actors playing charming characters. Hawaii is a beautiful place to have a movie.

However, the movie has very few unexpected twists and turns. It has beautiful people doing really stupid, evil things. I like some of the decisions the Owen Wilson's character makes. I like how his character relates to the Morgan Freeman's character. They seem to like each other and they talk some about wise choices and life in general.

Unfortunately, the secondary characters are really simplistic and stupid. I hope Willie Nelson, Charlie Sheen and Gary Sinese had a nice vacation in Hawaii, because they didn't get a chance to act. This makes their characters boring. The end is disappointing. The movie seems empty and pointless to me.

I haven't checked all the features on the DVD. There is a section on surfing shots, which is cool, but quickly gets boring. I did not like the movie enough to check out the other features and they did not look very interesting.",1093910400,,1072,4.783783783783784
2062207,4,B00024JC30,"`The Big Bounce' is a somewhat unusual comedy thriller somewhat similar to `Fletch', where the hero and his allies are perceived to be in real danger in the course of their largely funny business as they try to pull off some scheme or other. I confess I was not expecting a lot from this movie, and was very pleasantly surprised to find some extremely entertaining twists in action, characterization, and plot.

The first big surprise was in an early piece of business where our hero, played by Owen Wilson does a take on a similarly surprising scene from `Good Will Hunting' where the lead character unexpectedly actively picks a fight with a largely innocent supporting cast member. Things continue to get stranger from there, with the three main male supporting cast members, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, and Morgan Freeman are all playing against type. Sheen and Sinise are usually in the role of hero or at least supporting the good guy. Sheen is a bumbler and Sinise is the primary heavy. I won't comment on Freeman's twist because that will give away too much of the good stuff. I was disappointed that the roles for Bebe Neuwirth and the sorely missed Harry Dean Stanton were not larger. It seemed almost a waste to use such good supporting cast members in small roles, but they played them well.

I was surprised to see such a light comedy / thriller based on a story by Elmore Leonard, but it made me appreciate where the substance behind the story came. Like `Fletch' mentioned above, I suspect the movie makers did things to the story which were not really in tune with the tone of the original novel, but I think they succeeded in creating an entertaining flick. I was quite surprised by the quality of the movie, since it seems as if there was virtually no advertising campaign for the movie, or at least I slept through the fortnight when it appeared in theaters.

Several over reviewers gave poor to very poor reviews to this movie, and I suspect those are based on completely different expectations, based either on reading the novel or seeing an earlier version with a cast headed by Ryan O'Neal. As I had no expectations whatsoever other than those conveyed by the cast and the very lighthearted presentation on the DVD case, I was pleasantly surprised, as I am not an especially big Owen Wilson fan, and usually watch his movies based on the reputation of his costars, such as Jackie Chan and Ben Stiller.

For those of you who read the negative reviews, I recommend you reconsider. his is definitely not film noir and it is definitely not the usual thriller. It is simply good entertainment, where the main fault may have been in wasting some of the talents of the supporting cast, including Sinise, Sheen, and Stanton. Freeman is so perfectly cast and plays his role so well, that his fans should see this just for the switch he does here from his heavy thrillers like `Seven'.

Recommended viewing, as long as you don't take it too seriously.",1093824000,,2964,4.681381957773512
2062208,1,B00024JC30,"Why anyone would have thought it was a good idea to remake ""The Big Bounce,"" an utterly unmemorable 1969 caper comedy (based on an Elroy Leonard novel), is a complete mystery to me.  Owen Wilson takes over the role of Jack Ryan (originally played by Ryan O'Neal), a petty crook who has some issues with his ex-boss, Ray Ritchie, a corrupt real estate developer in Hawaii.  Hooking up with Ritchie's bombshell mistress, Ryan comes up with a scheme to rob the big man of a couple hundred thousand dollars.  Ryan is also befriended by an anti-Ritchie judge named Walter Crewes, for reasons that make almost no sense at all until the closing moments.  As in all films of this type, Ryan soon learns that people are not always what they appear to be and that the conning game can work both ways.  Actually, if the truth be told, Ryan is remarkably stupid for a con man.

The pacing of this film is almost shockingly bad.  The story plods along for a good hour or so before the inevitable plot twists begin to kick in.  Then, when they finally arrive, they are so poorly worked out and explained that you will probably be scratching your head wondering what it was that just happened - if you still care that is.  The attitude on the part of both the filmmakers and the actors is so lackadaisical and indifferent that the film is really an insult to the audience who is paying good money to sit through this mess.  In addition to Wilson, the film wastes the considerable talents of Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Willie Nelson, Harry Dean Stanton, Sara Foster and Gary Sinise, among others, all of whom at least got a trip to Hawaii out of the deal.  The people watching the movie, sadly, walk off with only a torn ticket stub for a souvenir.",1092528000,20,1736,4.496815286624204
2062209,2,B00024JC30,"I wanted to like this movie but I didnt. Owen Wilson (Zoolander, The Minus Man) is always pleasant to watch in his movies and you cant hate him. Morgan Freeman (Along Came A Spider, High Crimes) is just the man, why because it's Morgan fricking Freeman. Charlie Sheen (Tv's Spin City, Terminal Velocity) is nicely added since he barely does movies now. Gary Sinise (upcoming CSI: New York, Snake Eyes) is wasted in my mind. Willie flipping Nelson is in this movie!! who would of thought? He probably had nothing better to do. Bebe Neuwirth (Tv's Fraiser, Tv's Cheers) as Sinise's ditsy wife is a treat, Vinnie Jones (Snatch, Swordfish) is just a butthead and he deserved to get hit with a baseball bat. Harry Dean Stanton (Paris Texas, Sonny) is also in this movie! who would of thought also that Stanton would be in here? I certainly didn't and the lovely and ellegent Sara Foster plays the girl who woes Wilson into a cat and mouse game. This movie would do great if Foster wasn't in it, I mean she could be in it but put her in a beach scene, don't have her really act, just have running down the beach like Bo Derek except without the cornrolls. A good choice would of been Sarah Michelle Gellar or just someone. I spent too much time on Foster's parading around naked or half naked and that got me off the plot and when it hit at the end I was like damnit!! I was too busy focusing on the blonde then the movie and it was a disaster. ok, ill shut up now. Elmore Leonard probably was paying more attention on Foster then how they tore up his book.",1092355200,,1551,4.3517241379310345
2062210,5,B00024JC30,"Many of the reviews previously gave this film low ratings. However, their comments were not directed at the cast or the overall story. It was more generally the pace of the movie and the way the characters had limited dialouge and interaction. These comments are absolutely true. If you are the type of movie buff that enjoys overall plot twists (crime movies such as the usual suspects) or emotional acting (like titanic or some emotionally taunt movie) you won't find either in this flick. However, the movie has, in my opinion, something far greater to offer. It gives a realistic portrayal of Hawaii (and tropical vacation locales in general) and the scamming/corupt undercurrent that passes through local life in general. Many people that lived in the north would find it off to see boring, low-life, one dimensional characters randomly conning each other in beautifull breath taking scenery. You would expect an intense/exotic/mysterious con movie. However, thats not realistic. The truth is Hawaii is laid back. Tropical U.S. vacation spots like Miami and Hawaii are like this. The building contractors, various locales, and con men are somewhat low grade criminals and black mailers. There is a large economy of shady dealings and corruption. In all tropical vacation spots almost nobody originated there. In Hawaii there is a large segment of people from the mainland U.S. and Japan that own property. These people are less apt to actually care about the future of that Island, many have families living elsewhere. 70% of Miami speaks a different language than English as their first Language. Most of the people that speak english as their first language are from New York or the East coast originally. So I would estimate almost 80% of the families or people living in Miami are first generation, whether from another state or country. I enjoyed this movie imensly because it accurately portrayed the laid back beautifull environment of Hawaii and the mediocre overwhelming corrupt government and economy in an interesting combination.

  The dialogue also was complained as being too brief. This is another interesting aspect of the movie. The reason all the characters don't interact together much is that they are all scheming each other. The point of the movie as morgan friedman stated was that sometimes things are exactly what they seem: everybody is trying to con each other. If the characters acted and interacted more frequently or more intensly they would not be able to con each other. For example Owen Wilson and Foster(the blond girl?) were complained of not being passionate enough. The reason for this is that they were trying to scam each other. Also the movie leaves a lot of room for interpretation because its not spelled out for you. Both me and my GF had to different ideas of what happened in the end because really no character is the mastermind. Although it seems Owen made out the best (main character ...duh) were never sure, because all the events were portrayed as happening by luck. Because in real life this is how scams seem.... just a coincidence. If everyone could understand all the angles in real life there would be no scams..... because everyone could tell it was a scam from the begining. This is how the movie portrayed the environment, activities (scams), and the characters (one dimensional or as owen narates in the begining ""having bad timing and making bad choices.... luckily i believe in new beginings and running from my problems"" something like that)realistically.  We can instantly see in this that these characters will not be typical hollywood heroes. If your looking for a typical hollywood con movie with big plot twists and expert characters see matchstick men or usual suspects. If your looking for a realistic portrayal of the monotanaeous,relaxed, and tragecly comedic life of criminals,contractors, and corupt judges in the tropics this is the movie for you.",1092009600,6,3928,5.057098765432099
2062211,2,B00024JC30,"This is a stylish production with fantastic sets, stunning scenery, and some decent acting, especially by Morgan Freeman.  The dialogue that sounded like classic Elmore Leonard was taut and witty, but seemed out of context.  Ms. Foster has a hot figure, but her character is more valley girl than sultry temptress.  And while I love Owen Wilson's perennially sunny personality and the fact that he makes such an unlikely con artist, he doesn't bring any cynicism or complexity to this role.  Even his most cold and calculating lines are delivered in a characteristically laid-back and friendly tone of voice.  This flic is billed as a film noir, but it seems like all the noir got laundered out in the gorgeous turquoise surf.",1091318400,,726,4.918032786885246

2062213,2,B00024JC30,"At about the one-hour mark, I realized this movie was never going to really take off.  It's short to begin with (88 minutes including credits), and after being very patient it was frustrating that there was no real payoff.

Don't get me wrong, the movie has sort of an easy-going charm.  A little too easy-going, to be blatantly honest.  For a movie about con men pulling various scams, the movie just didn't have a lot of energy.  The cast can't be faulted, plenty of A-list talent.  Most of the movie rests on Owen Wilson, who is more or less typecast here, and newcomer Sara Foster, who is stunningly attractive but rather bland as an actress.  The movie could've benefited from a little steam, but either Foster had a no-nudity clause or the producers didn't want to go beyond a PG-13 rating for some reason.  In supporting roles, great actors like Morgan Freeman and Gary Sinise have very little to do in underwritten roles.

The movie is easy on the eyes, lots of great cinematography featuring the natural beauty of Hawaii.  The cast is game, even when working with very little.  There are a few off-handed laughs sprinkled throughout.  And for two-thirds of the running time, I was fairly certain that things would come together with some nice twists and a satisfying conclusion.  The satisfaction never really occurred, and the movie faded from memory not long after it was over.

The dvd looks and sounds great (some cool tunes on the soundtrack, sounding great in the 5.1 mix).  I realize the movie was a bomb at the box office, but even so a little more effort could've been put into the supplemental features.  Here's what we get:  a 12 minute promotional featurette (standard mix of movie clips, cast interviews, behind-the-scenes snippets), a 3 minute mini-featurette about the surfing segments (a very minor part of the movie), and 7 minutes of surf footage outtakes (with surfing being such a sidenote in the movie, I guess they wanted to get some use out of this footage!).",1090454400,10,1991,4.75801749271137

No.  It's flat, and chill and beautiful and the only crime is that ""bounce"" you get when you break into a house as a teenager but aren't really going to steel anything.  The vibe.

It's possibly the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation ever, with a cast completely unsuited to playing Elmore Leonard characters. Owen Wilson seems to have infected the whole project with his easy-going surfer dood casualness. There hasn't been a movie that looked or felt so lazy and uncaring since the Rat Pack era. There's not a soul involved who takes it seriously, not even as a lighthearted comedy. It has the feel of a movie they all barely remembered to shoot scene by scene between parties on the beach or by the pool, then left a meager pile of footage for somebody to try to do something with in the editing suite. If you're into pretty girls, you'll like watching Sara Foster, who's hot in a beer-commercial-on-the-beach sort of way and wears little or no clothes throughout the thing. But she can't act to save her life and only seems to be in the flick to distract you from the fact that absolutely nothing else is going on.

Other strange pots of poi simmer on the backburner, here, though, with just enough  twists to keep me watching. Morgan Freeman supplies more than a couple of surprises, and Vinnie Jones from LOCK, STOCK, AND 2 SMOKIN' BARRELS / Guy Ritchie fame brings toned down Brit thuggery moments that add a welcome bit of texture. Gore-free play zone with sex lite occasions and the real sensation of walking-around Hawaii beyond the ugly resorts.

Underplayed and well paced, I thought. Your typical formulaic pacing is quicker with a conventional build in tension as the characters head towards the blocking mechanisms keeping them from their goals. Some people seem to need that format but I often find it manipulating, irritating and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. This film beautifully side-steps these conventions in a stylish, smooth and playful way.

One such example is 2004's THE BIG BOUNCE, the second attempt at adapting Leonard's novel.

Owen Wilson stars as Jack Ryan, a small-time con artist who was recently fired from his job after dislocating his employer's jaw with a baseball bat.  After a series of chance encounters, he falls for the mysterious Nancy Hayes (Sara Foster), who tells him about her fool-proof plan to steal $200,000 from her rich ""boyfriend"", Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise).  Things may not be as they seem, but Jack has too many other things on his mind to worry about that, like his wise new boss (Morgan Freeman), his stand-offish old boss Bob Jr. (Charlie Sheen), and his angry  ex-supervisor (Vinnie Jones).

THE BIG BOUNCE, despite the all-star cast, is not a good movie.  Sebastian Gutierrez's script is rather weak, particularly during the non-sensical closing.  The acting is less than superb, although Freeman is good (as always).  George Armitage is not as talented a director as previous Leonard adaptators Quentin Tarantino or Steven Soderbergh, and thus THE BIG BOUNCE fails as both a comedy and, more so, as a crime caper.

That said, the film is rather entertaining.  Why?  I don't know.  It has its moments - once when Owen Wilson answers a stolen cell phone, and once when he engages in a furious fight with Sheen - but for the most part, it's not funny.  During some scene transistions, we are shown surfers crashing into the ocean.  It's meant to be funny, but it's not.  At all.  And yet the film is still entertaining.  I would attribute this to the cast, which manages to hold the film up for its 88 minute runtime.  If it were any longer than that, however, the film would be almost unbearably dumb.",1150848000,,1978,4.694767441860465
2062345,2,B00024JC30,"Over the past number of years I have familiarized myself with the pleasant oddities of Elmore Leonard's books and the films conjured from his genius. There is a machine concealed within the mind of this man that creates characters and plots so original that you never know what you are going to get. You can read his novels with the same awe that you can watch the film adaptations. A film such as ""Get Shorty"" or ""Jackie Brown"" can arguably compare to the man's work.

Those two films are rarities in the sense that they function solely on the brilliance of Leonard and the social oddballs whom he produces. All of them are interesting people. You have mobsters, drifters, crooked cops, criminals, liars, cheaters, killers, and thieves elbowing each other for screen time. He uses his characters as valuable people, not fictional pawns, and they are all necessities to the story.

In the case of George Armitage's train wreck, ""The Big Bounce,"" we are deprived of the luxuries of interest and captivation that the characters are supposed to create. Instead, the film takes the bold foundation of Leonard's book and mutates it into an inferior lackluster comedy, a ballsy and unfortunate mistake. Would it be wise to point out that ""The Bourne Identity"" at least came within a mile of being as good as Robert Ludlum`s novel, even if it took the plot in an entirely different direction?

The cast appears to be one that was gathered at the last minute. Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman, Sara Foster, and Gary Sinise, all very gifted people who made the mistake of buying into the script, carry the story with some degree of willingness. For a film to have good actors and disrespect their talents is an unfortunate case that is all-too common. ""The Big Bounce"" uses the big name actors for show and narrative hinderance, not for any productive reason.

Jack Ryan (Owen Wilson) is a beach bum surfer dude who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Jack drifts around the Hawaiian Islands looking for work after being released from prison, and he is hired by a local judge, Walter Crewes (Morgan Freeman), to do custodial work in and around a certain beach area. Through his unfavorable job, Jack comes across Nancy (Sara Foster), a beautiful, bikini-clad seductress who wants to run a major scam on her developer boyfriend. That would be the wealthy and powerful Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise), whose apparent ties to the mob will prove to be a challenge to her scheme.

A few of the characters have hidden motives and obscure areas of reason, but the film tries to focus a bit too much on that. Instead of going ahead with their plan, Jack and Nancy tease and kid with one another in an obvious attempt to sidestep their sexual chemistry. The Freeman character stumbles around aimlessly in ignorance of the trouble that his employee is getting into. Sinise shows up only when the film is blatantly desperate for the story to continue. Charlie Sheen, who has gone unmentioned up until this point, is the puppet of the Sinise character, and his rivalry with Jack supplies an admirably humorous moment. And there is an outside player who pretty much ties everything together, however bizarre, albeit marginally brilliant, it may be.

But ""The Big Bounce,"" in its feeble entirety, is a bit of a bore. The story lingers and never really engages itself, making the film seem as long as a Ridley Scott epic when it is only a brisk 88 minutes. It is a wind-up and no pitch, a clock without all of its functioning parts, the Three Stooges without Curly. Everything feels like it originated from Leonard. The movie, on the other hand, feels like it originated from a script that was written for the sole purpose of altering a story unwillingly. Whoever gave this movie a green light should not be happy with themselves. - Isaac

2062346,1,B00024JC30,"Remember ""The Quick And The Dead""? I wondered why such an all star (Hackman, Stone, De Caprio, Crowe, etc) cast would appear in such a mediocre play -one of the worst movies ever made-; well... I tought that was it, one blunder in film history is ok! But...here we go again: Morgan Freeman, my hero!, one of the most respectable and underrated actors ever, ouch!. I bought the movie because of him! Don't get me wrong: his acting is simple impecable; just a natural born actor. But the movie, oh no!, a comedy with no humor...a thriller with no suspense. Why Morgan? Why?

Not everything is bad: Foster's anatomical display is the highlight and Bebe Neuwirth looks very hot and adorable.

2062348,2,B00024JC30,"This movie stars Owen Wilson as a petty thief named Jack Ryan trying to make his way in Hawaii.  After attacking a co-worker with a baseball bat, Wilson is befriended by Walter (Morgan Freeman) the local judge/resort owner who offers Jack a job instead of sending him to jail.  Jack eventually meets Nancy (Sara Foster) who is having an affair with Jack's rich, former boss Ray (Gary Sinise).  Jack and Nancy plan to steal money from Ray's cabin and this forms the ""plot"" of the movie.

I guess that this is supposed to be a ""heist"" movie, but most of the movie does not really focus around the heist much at all.  Instead, Jack and Nancy dance around and have a stupid flittery romance for most of the scenes.  Jack and Nancy's plan is never completely fleshed out and seems rather simplistic.  I can say that there are some suprizes when the actually get around to stealing the money, but the suprises are somewhat predictable and not really that inovative.

I agree with other viewers who say that the actors in this movie are wasted on shallow characters.  There is nothing stellar about Wilson's character and Foster's character is little more than eye candy.  Freeman, Charlie Sheen, and Gary Sinse (who only has a few lines in the movie) should have been better.

In terms of heist movies, this one falls far short.  If you want a good heist movie, see The Italian Job.  Even National Treasure has a pretty good heist scene.  But The Big Bounce has no interesting scenes of thievey whatsoever unless you consider stealing a bunch of wallets from a house as interesting.  Instead, The Big Bounce is just full of petty would-be criminals and half-baked schemes.",1117929600,,1666,4.676975945017182
2062349,4,B00024JC30,"Maybe this second movie version of Elmore Leonard's caper novel of the same name (first filmed in 1969 with Ryan O'Neal and Leigh Taylor-Young) is no GET SHORTY or OUT OF SIGHT, but it's a lot more fun than critics gave it credit for (a lot more fun than the dreary original, for sure!), and it deserved to do better at the box office. When it came out back in January 2004, this BIG BOUNCE's new Hawaii setting was especially welcome during that year's harsh winter season! Hell, all it took to make me love this flick was the playful rock-tinged Hawaiian-style score (though scorer George S. Clinton missed an opportunity: it would've been such a hoot to include Paul Revere & The Raiders' ""Kicks"" or a cool cover of same, in honor of TBB's thrill-seeking leads! :-), the lush tropical scenery, and the sight of Owen Wilson naked in the ocean! :-) Wilson, the king of comedic neo-slacker cool, is in his element as Jack Ryan (so not Tom Clancy's action hero! :-), an ex-con surfer dude with a penchant for getting in trouble (as he says, his ""two longtime companions"" are ""bad luck and bad choices""). Jack gets into plenty of it thanks to newcomer Sara Foster as Nancy, a sun-kissed cutie with the insouciant insolence of the young Lauren Bacall. Wilson and Foster have an easygoing, playful chemistry even when they get their kicks from stealing cars and ""B&E"" (Breaking and Entering, a popular indoor sport for movie couples earlier this year what with TBB and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND). When the stakes are raised up to murder, however, Jack has to start rethinking his laissez-faire approach to life... Wilson and Foster have a great cast to double-cross and be double-crossed by, including Morgan Freeman, Bebe Neuwirth, Gary Sinise, our fave British movie tough guy Vinnie Jones (nice change of pace, seeing him get his butt kicked for a change :-), Willie Nelson, and Charlie Sheen and Harry Dean Stanton as father and son! Add lots of snappy dialogue (I particularly liked Wilson's ""friendship"" speech to Gregory Sporleder: ""If I'm in trouble, you won't be there for me...I won't be there for you..."" It's a Bogart-style tough-guy speech given a slyly witty spin thanks to Wilson's laid-back delivery), much of it uttered over the rocks (in more ways than one -- I haven't seen so much drinking in a crime comedy since the THIN MAN movies, only the drinking impairs the characters' judgment here :-), and you've got a lighthearted, lightweight way to pass a lazy afternoon, especially if the weather is too dreary for real-life fun in the sun!",1117584000,,2566,4.7685393258426965
2062350,2,B00024JC30,"Owen Wilson heads up a pretty amazing cast list here as Jack Ryan, the petty thief pretty boy in Hawaii, trying to hit big. Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, Willy Nelson, Sara Foster and even Harry Dean Stanton......and the list goes on. Even the pedigree of Elmore Leonards novel and George Armitage in the directors chair (Grosse Pointe Blank) make you sit back after watching this and ask - What happened? This is a very dull movie that promises much, but fails to deliver on just about all levels. A who's scamming who? game unfolds that keeps you guessing, but fails to really grab your attention, and looks like everyone was just going through the motions for a paycheck. The visual distraction of Foster (virtually bikini clad throughout the picture)wears thin very quickly, and even though I am a fan of Wilson, I found this picture to be hard work. Always waiting for something to get going leaves you feeling deflated as the end titles roll, and aside from a few sparse moments of comedy I cannot really recommend this movie. Freeman is as always engaging, but even his talents are wasted here, and one suspects that the original 1969 movie was better as it at least had an ending. The confusing and implied added ""twist"" at the end here makes no sense at all, and feels like a fun ride that ends halfway round. Rainy day material only, and rent before buying.",1113782400,2,1381,4.663934426229508
2062361,1,B00024JC30,"Pssshhh....I have seen month old garbage that seemed more appealing than this crooked caper.  Just like the title suggests, The Big Bounce, is nothing more than a deeply contrived story that lacks in story, element, and excitement, and instead takes comfort in the ability to ""bounce"" us around from character to character in hopes that big names and Hawaiian scenery will help us forget about the plot.  Well, Mr. Director, it did not.  In fact, the poor story and lacking excitement only gives us this rotted taste in our mouths that somehow now surfaces whenever we see pictures of Hawaii, Owen Wilson, and Oscar winner Morgan Freeman.  Who read these scripts before the actors jumped aboard?  I am nearly certain that no actor in their right mind would have read this script and with the greatest pleasure, joined this production.  I have no Earthly clue as to how director George Armitage found all these people and got them to sign the dotted line, but it is the only aspect of this film that he can be applauded for.  Normally, when you see the names Morgan Freeman, Owen Wilson, and Gary Sinise, you are expecting some level of decency, yet that never seemed to arrive with The Big Bounce.

The top layer of icing on this disturbing cake were the actors.  Years at Juliard thrown out the window when it came to this film.  Apparently, the appeal of working in Hawaii for free was more appealing than actually doing work that you could be proud of.  Apparently, the appeal of working in Hawaii proved better than any sort of million dollar pay scale that any of these fine, OSCAR-winning actors should deserve.  Either way, the acting gave us nothing into the lives of these flimsy, nearly one-dimensional characters.  The leader of this pact was Owen Wilson trying to give us a spin-off of his character from Bottle Rocket where these ""cute"" one-liners were allowed because Owen Wilson is so ""cute"" himself.  Give me a break.  He wasn't even acting in this film.  There were moments where I thought I could see his character beginning to form, but then he opened his mouth and any sort of evidence crashed down on the hard floor.  The same can easily be said for Freeman (which I never thought I would say about), Charlie Sheen (who was miserable in this film), and Gary Sinise (who just can't seem to cover evil that well).  From the top of the list completely down to the bottom, nobody seemed to care about actually building a character, but instead just enjoying the sun and sand.

Then, as we dig deeper into this pathetic cake, we discover that not all the fault lies on the shoulder of the actors (though I would have to say that a major part does), but instead some of the dead weight of this film actually falls on the shoulders of George Armitage, director at large.  He honestly makes us wait, the honest working people that paid for this film, until halfway through the film to begin bringing us into the heart of the story.  I am nearly certain that this is not the way that Leonard would have penned it.  We have short-term characters trying to give themselves a name in this film with nothing happening within the first hour.  This is sad.  This only causes more confusion and chaos as we slowly, at an ants pace, reach the middle of the film where we finally begin to see the inevitable clichs that follow this type of movie.  Armitage takes no risks or any creativity in building our story from the ground up and honestly acts as if he is enjoy the sand and sun as much as the rest.  He gives us nothing but bits and irrelevant pieces that show us nothing and give us even less.

Then, as if perhaps the bottom of this crunchy cake would finally provide us with something of substance, actually just proves to be yet another disappointing let down.  Even when you think you know what is going on, Armitage throws that extra bit of unknown morsel your way to keep you guessing deep within the hours of the next morning.  The only trouble is, I didn't care.  When the ending of this film finally occurred, it stumped me for nearly three seconds as I realized that this wasn't the film that I needed to worry myself over.  There wasn't any reason for me to be excited when this film started, and by God, there wasn't any reason for me to find myself loosing sleep over this convoluted ending either.

Armitage really did some damage with this film.  Everyone, including the amateurish editor, took a holiday on this film.  It is not a good sign when you watch the theatrical trailer to the film and then watch the film itself only to discover that half the scenes from the trailer didn't make the final cut of the film.  Oh, how sad it is to see a film like this suffer.  It had quite a bit of potential to break the common mold and provide at least several minutes of entertainment, but alas, it chose not to go the extra mile.  The idea of spending more time on the film instead of on the beach collecting rays seemed to be the popular consensus with the cast and crew.  Procrastination and poor workmanship seemed to be a hirer priority for these filmmakers and their final result will show it.

It also seems to be a music video as sometimes the music gets in the way of the story instead of enhancing it (JET's ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" is an excellent rocker). The cast is impressive, but the film seems lightweight and unmemorable. There are some twists and turns to all the miscreant, but something is lacking.  Lead Owen Wilson's Jack Ryan is pathetic and hard to root for. Maybe that is one of the problems with the film (who wants to root a professional thief in the first place). Sara Foster as Nancy is not too distracting of eye candy as the lead femme fatale.  Maybe that is part of the problem also, we want her to be distracting but she comes off as another face in the crowd of beach bunnies. The film is slightly interesting because of the presence of Morgan Freeman in a somewhat phone-in performance and Bebe Neuwirth is always good in everything she does.

The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the humor is average, the plot is way below average, and then there's the great location; HAWAII...

So it's a weak plot, a great setting and a wonderful cast, which when put together fail to take off.

The potential for a great movie was definitely there.

2062367,2,B00024JC30,"This is the second film version of Elmore Leonard's 'The Big Bounce' published in 1969.  In the same year, they made a film starring Ryan O'Neal, which Elmore Leonard, himself a great film buff, didn't like.  Now, for the newer version, Hollywood  assembled very impressive cast, plus the director George Armitage, who did a pretty good job in 'Grosse Pointe Blank.'  SO ... what happened to this newer film, which is so thin in contents?

Not everything is bad, and the star Owen Wilson is not to be blamed.  He plays a very likable small-time thief Jack Ryan, who fell for a gorgeous girl Nancy in Hawaii.  Nancy (played by newcomer Sara Foster) is game for fun, and petty crimes too, but this time the stake is high.  She encourages Jack to steal $200,000 hidden in the house of one rich guy Ray, with whom she is having an affair.  The story is a typical Elmore Leonard.

See this great cast.  In addition to Wilson and Foster, you get Morgan Freeman, Gary Sinise, Charlie Sheen, Vinnie Jones, Bebe Neuwirth, Willie Nelson, and Harry Dean Stanton.  The film is entirely shot on location in beautiful Hawaii, so you can enjoy the blue sea and the landscapes.

And ... what a thin story!  The main story is too cursorily told to interest us, and the pretty amusing performances of the talented actors are sadly thrown away among the weak plot, which gets lost among the pointless set-pieces.  One example.  Vinnie Jones plays a hot-tempered supervisor of a construction site.  In the middle part of the film, he terrorizes Wilson and Freeman, riding a RV.  The scene happens and ends suddenly, out of the context of the film.  The motives of characters, or the relations between them, often lack enough explanation, leaving us wonder 'who is he, anyway?'

I do not know Elmore Leonard's personal reaction to this film.  He must have seen it already, and most probably he didn't like it.  Very sporadically the film shows the unmistakable touch of Leonard's -- good dialogues and unpredictable story -- but you need an ear of Tarantino to make his great books into equally great films.",1102204800,3,2086,4.704419889502763
2062368,2,B00024JC30,"Everything about this movie and DVD screams ""let's wrap this up and get the hell out of here."" For one, the film runs a paltry 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is little better than a special extended episode of a TV show. It seemes like the director realized the film was getting out of control and losing it's pace, so he simply jammed the final scenes together and ended the movie with some island shots. Even the actors seemed like they were just going through the motions in the second half, which is sad considering you have real talent in the leading roles. How disappointed did Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman and Gary Sinese have to be? At least it was filmed in Hawaii and Sara Foster was in a bikini 90% of the time.

The DVD is short on extra features as well. Other than the obligatory ""behind-the-scenes,"" the rest of the special features are surfing shots. They throw in an Owen Wilson interview in where he mentions that his character was a surfer (for about 30 seconds in the film) and then we go right into the big wave footage. Granted, the shots are pretty cool, but they have nothing to do with the movie.

For the most part I like Elmore Leonard adaptations, but it seems like there has to be a top-line director attached to make sense of the complicated plots, i.e. Sonnenfeld with Get Shorty, Tarantino with Jackie Brown (based on Rum Punch) and Soderbergh with Out of Sight. In The Big Bounce you get a plot that starts out interestingly enough, but by the end every single character is suddenly double-crossing the others within a space of 15 minutes. Where is the plot development? Where are the character's motivations? It all ends up as a big mess. Maybe we should be happy that it's only 80 minutes long.

2062369,4,B00024JC30,"I really didn't expect a lot from this movie - but it did feature Morgan Freeman, the greatest actor working today, as well as the scantily-clad Sara Foster, so I said what the heck.  Actually, the movie really isn't that bad.  Sure, it's a little silly and predictably unpredictable (you know how these comic con game movies are), it sometimes seems as if the actors are making things up as they go along, and the ending leaves much to be desired, but - and I hate to admit this - Owen Wilson is pretty darn funny, the Hawaiian setting is gorgeous, there's no shortage of bikini-clad ladies, and the storyline is enough to keep you interested.  You also have all these weird cameo appearances by celebrities such as Gary Sinise, Willie Nelson, Harry Dean Stanton, and Bebe Neuwirth - they don't really add to the movie, but you're always wondering what famous person will show up next.

I don't think I need to explain how these con game movies work, not after all of the con game movies Hollywood has sent our way in recent years.  You've got your con, then you've got your hidden ""conspiracy"" of con men and women making things more complicated, and then you have an ending that flies off in another direction altogether without adequately explaining what just happened.  Owen Wilson plays Jack Ryan, a rather typical roustabout who has made his way to Hawaii.  There's an unfortunate incident involving his supervisor's head and a baseball bat, but oddly enough, the district judge Walter Crewes (Morgan Freeman) gives him a job, and it's not long before he is hanging out with Nancy Hayes (Sara Foster), the young mistress of Jack's now-former boss Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise).  Drawing upon the natural charms she was blessed with, Nancy talks Jack into pulling a heist for her; two hundred grand is going to be ripe for the plucking and - best of all - the robbery victim will be none other than Ray Ritchie himself.  Now that you know the basic setup, forget all about it because things change a great deal by the time everything actually goes down.

Morgan Freeman was, naturally, quite good in this film - although I don't consider The Big Bounce to be much of a feather in his cap.  Methinks my favorite actor really just wanted to spend a working vacation in Hawaii.  It seems obvious to me that Owen Wilson was the perfect choice to play Jack Ryan - I'm not saying he's a great actor, but few actors could have delivered all of his cheesy dialogue without bringing the whole production down around his feet.  Sara Foster is quite good as well (and I'm not just saying that because she was scantily-clad most of the time).  Unfortunately, the ending of the movie just isn't very satisfying - too much is left unexplained, and it just doesn't feel right.

Maybe I'm just too easy to please, but I think The Big Bounce is a pretty good film for the most part - a silly little diversion that will make you laugh a few times and leave you feeling entertained (although the unsatisfying conclusion might lead you to forget the good things about the film).",1098316800,12,3060,4.609576427255985

Basically the plot revolves around Owen Wilson's character who gets in a fight with his foreman at a construction site after the guy doesn't respect the locals who are protesting at the site.  The former company wants him to leave the island, but Morgan Feeeman who is the island's judge, and also runs a cabin park on the beach convinces him to stay and work for him since he doesn't like those former employers much.  Meanwhile the girlfriend of someone else in his former company (I'm not real sure what Charlie Sheen's character was) has caught his eye. She likes bad boys and the two enjoy trespassing in people's houses and stealing stuff, until she proposes a big score.

The movie is fairly short and with so many big names such as Charlie Sheen, you're left feeling they could have had a few more scenes as many don't have much screen time at all.",1465862400,,1286,4.423728813559322
