1960011,3,B0000YWKFO,"I was excited to hear that I could purchase the Due South TV Series on DVD through Amazon since it was unavailable here in Australia (& since my VHS tapes were showing disintegration from the many times I was watching them!)

For Seasons 1-2, I was disappointed to find the packaging format was quite poor and there wasn't anything by way of DVD extras (not even out-takes).  I also had problems with reading a couple of episodes even after attempting to clean the DVD disc surface.

When I purchased Season 3, I was also disappointed to find that it really only had half the number of episodes that make up a normal season, thereby forcing viewers to have to purchase the second half (and given the AUD$ exchange rate, does end up being quite expensive).

The only redeeming feature for the Season 3 release was that the episodes were not double sided this time around and they were properly labelled.

Overall, I'm just happy to have my own copies of the TV series that I enjoy immensely.",1100736000,25,990,4.570621468926554
1960012,5,B0000YWKFO,"It's great having these episodes, even knowing you're going to have to shell out more money to buy season 4 when it is released.  It's not a huge stretch of the imagination to see where the confusion came from:  13 episodes is a half season, and even trustworthy episode guide sites disagree on whether there were 3 or 4 seasons.  Anyways, according to Alliance Atlantis, they are aiming for an early 2005 release of season 4.  I'd take it with a grain of salt considering I got the same kind of message telling me season 3 would be released in January 2004.",1097280000,13,558,4.4411764705882355

1960050,5,B0000YWKFO,"LOVED the show and have been meaning to get this season,....will be getting the last later, looking forward to it!",1399593600,,114,4.75
1960051,4,B0000YWKFO,"For me, ""Due South"" is definitely a show that carries a lot of nostalgic weight.  I remember seeing the show a long long time ago without ever knowing the title...only to suddenly remember its existence and find out it's name this year.  It really was my first ""crime drama"".  Seeing it year later, the show still has a certain charm and appeal...while being quite refreshing in the rareness of it's themes, today.

CONTENT ISSUES:  Well, by today's standards, the show is very ""family friendly"" and clean...BUT not without qualifiers.  Sometimes the characters do cuss (though it does not go much further than ""D****** t"").  There really isn't much innuendo and such, but sometimes when they depict some criminals, at times there are cases like when there is, shall we say, a ""woman-for-hire"" wrapped in a blanket in the background to further accentuate the criminal archetype of that episode's antagonist.  But honestly, it's still quite tame.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
Well, for one thing, this Canadian production earns major props for having a Mountie as one of the main protagonists of the show.  It's not often that we get televised depictions of them.  But beyond that aspect, this show carries a wonderful blend of both real-life-down-to-earth Cop show, to smile-inducing comedies, to straight up serious dramatic moments.  To top it all off, it wonderfully adds a touch of fantasy (that works ironically well, especially considering a lot of the show takes place in the depths of Chicago).  The show certainly has an immense sense of variety...though of course it ultimately comes down (most of the time) to apprehending the episode's criminal.  It is largely episodic by nature (meaning episodes can stand alone), but they do well to reference events from past episodes...and at times have an overarching direction.  The character chemistry is also an experience in of itself since each of the actors really defines their respective characters quite well.

VIDEO:
The video quality is not bad...but it really carries the visual quality it had during the 90s (more specifically: the best video quality you could have had during that decade).  It doesn't bother me and I find the video to still be quite clear, but for some that is worth noting.

SOUND:
It's good.  It's decent.  I have no problems with it.

PACKAGING:
All 26-episodes are found on three discs.  The case is a standard sized plastic DVD case (cheaper plastic, it seems), with the discs stored in flip book fashion.  This next part is the one reason I knocked off a star: You CANNOT select individual episodes from the menu.  Rather, they are generally grouped in threes.  For example, Disc 1 has nine episodes...but those episodes are divided into 3 groups (ex. Group A: ep 1-3; Group B: ep. 4-6, Group C: ep. 7-9).  You select the group.  I honestly can't fathom the reasoning for this when most others allow you to select individual episodes...but at least it just takes 2 or 3 (I forget) chapter-forwards to move to the next episode.  Also, just to note, the episodes are around 45 minutes each.

This is definitely a gem of a show.  The wonderful character chemistry.  Also, the seamless blending of themes and multiple genres (comedy, drama, fantasy, etc.) is truly astounding.  And especially the way that Fraser and Ray both compliment and contrast each other is a great conversation starter.  ""Due South"" maybe underrated...but it can be a thrilling and thought provoking ride to those who find it.",1392249600,,3488,4.9689119170984455

1960071,5,B0000YWKFO,"The DVD releases of DUE SOUTH have been confusing, so it's not surprising that there's also some confusion in the reviews.

I'm holding a copy of this edition in my hand, and it clearly says on the front ""26 Episodes"" (squeezed onto 3 discs, unfortunately). The titles of all 26 episodes are listed on the back (with ""Mountie on the Bounty"" and ""Call of the Wild"" both counted as two episodes).

In Canada, the 13 episodes ending with ""Mountie on the Bounty"" were Series 3, and the 13 episodes ending in ""Call of the Wild"" were Series 4.

In the US, CBS showed 22 of those 26 episodes as Season 3. The four episodes left out--""Dead Men Don't Throw Rice,"" ""Good for the Soul,"" ""Say Amen,"" and ""Hunting Season""--were first aired in the US on TNT.

All 26 episodes are in this set.

There ain't no more--that's all, folks. Sixty-eight total episodes.

Buyer beware: there is a different DVD set called DUE SOUTH: THE FINAL SEASON. There is no episode guide on the box, and you have to have pretty good eyes to read where it says the running time is only about 10 hours. This is the Canadian ""Series 4."" The only significant bonus feature is a Paul Gross commentary track for ""Call of the Wild."" Otherwise, everything included in that set is also included in the set being reviewed here.",1371340800,,1283,4.508620689655173
1960072,3,B0000YWKFO,"This is difficult to assign a single rating to.  Due South is a VERY enjoyable series, but it is marred by the disappointing quality of the video on these disks.  As several other reviewers noted, the producer of these disks tried to ""save a buck"" by cramming too many episodes onto each disk (and not from a master source) - and the quality of the episodes is noticeably sub-standard as a result.  What a shame for such an enjoyable series that, were it not for the disappointing video quality, I would have rated a 4.  Further, were it not for the lack of closed captioning on all of the disks/episodes, my rating would have risen to a 4 1/2 (sorry, I virtually NEVER assign the absolute top rating to anything - but that's just me).  Compounding my disappointment is the fact that reviewers have been reporting this for MONTHS! (years actually), so I was anticipating some/all of the reported disappointments to have been resolved by now (does the seller not read these?).  Personally, I would have preferred to pay a bit more and get higher quality video and closed captioning.

In the end, my headline sums it up - I enjoyed the episodes' content, but found the lack of production quality irritating.  I MIGHT repeat the purchase (if unable to find a higher quality example), but would certainly NOT if a higher quality example was available - even at a higher price.",1368403200,,1372,4.640495867768595

1960075,1,B0000YWKFO,"Navigation, on these disks doesn't work very well, as you cannot select an individual episode, if three (3) episodes are on a single line you cannot select the second or third one to watch you have to fast forward through one to get to two or through one and two to get to the third. It's a bad duplication on the navigation part of the DVD and makes me question the authenticity of the videos.",1355702400,,394,4.266666666666667
1960076,5,B0000YWKFO,I remember when this series was originally on.  Am so glad to now own it.  It is one which we will enjoy over and over again.,1355356800,,125,3.769230769230769
1960077,4,B0000YWKFO,"Hi Everyone,

If you watched the other 2 seasons, you wouldn't want to miss Season 3, which is the final series and does have an ending rather than being a cliffhanger. I'd ignore the debate regarding the new Ray and the old Ray because the good news is that doesn't really matter as the shows are still fun and make for a light, happy and engaging viewing experience.  In the end, the character change works out fine anyhow.

Although the first couple shows or so started a little slow for me, Season 3 picked up steam as it continued and got better and better as we all rolled along.  I hated to see ""Due South"" end because I so enjoyed the characters, especially Frazier's boss, when she let loose. In Season 3, all the characters were starting to develop more and have more air time, which created a more varied and interesting aspect to the series. Good for the whole family to enjoy together.  Congratulations to Paul Gross and all those who made this a very fun show.  Hope to see all of you work together again.",1348272000,,1019,4.422459893048129

1960079,4,B0000YWKFO,"David Marciano from seasons 1 and 2 appears only in a couple of episodes this season, and Callum Keith Rennie is okay as his replacement but somehow lacks his rogueish appeal.

Paul Gross takes a stronger hand in producing and writing this time around, while the dog-wolf hybrid isn't featured much at all anymore.

Still satisfying though not completely so.",1289174400,,358,4.95
1960080,5,B0000YWKFO,"Due South is such a great series--really glad to finally have Season Three in my collection. Paul Gross is wonderful as Constable Benton Frasier (Canadian Mountie); and I definitely prefer David Marciano as Ray Veccio, over Callum Keith Rennie--but he's a good actor & I got used to him after a while. The paper-style packaging keeps the DVD's well-protected, much to my surprise, and allows 4 disks to fit in smaller space than the normal hard-cover cases. (Not sure I would want all of my DVD's in those, however, since I'm not always careful with my boxes.)

1960081,3,B0000YWKFO,I bought the set with Callum Keith Rennie. I became interested in him from Battlestar 'Flesh and Bone'. He did a very good acting job so I am looking for anything he is in.

1960082,5,B0000YWKFO,I am really enjoying watching this set of dvds. I am pleased that I took the time to read the reviews otherwise I would have purchased what I thought was season 4 but was really the last 2 episodes of season 3. I loved this show when it was on tv many years ago and I am enjoying it again now. Here in Australia only 2 seasons were available to purchase at the stores and I was told there was no release date for season 3 ....I couldn't wait so I went to Amazon and have had no hassles with my order..I actually got it before the date they stated on the order. I don't mind the new Ray.......it is so long since I saw it that I had forgotten Ray changed! Great viewing and hard to stop at one or two episodes at a time. I love Due South.,1241395200,,737,3.92
1960083,5,B0000YWKFO,"I'm such a Due South fan. I can never get enough of the cute mountie and the great theme music. I love the original partner, too. He reminds me of my boyfriend in Germany. HoT! Yeah you, Rick!",1222819200,,192,4.078947368421052
1960084,1,B0000YWKFO,"I have both releases- a friend bought me this one and I purchased seasons 3&4 from Amazon.ca- and the Canadian release is better. The American release is cheaper, and looks it. The sound and video quality is bad, four episodes are missing, and they slapped David Mercano all over it. If you're a RayK fan, which you'd pretty much have to be in order to be looking to buy season three, the Canadian release is better.",1215216000,4,416,4.4868421052631575
1960095,4,B0000YWKFO,"Due South is a fantastic series -one of my favorites actually. It's a drama with lots of comedy about a mounty coming to the city... Season three was probably not the best of the three/four but once you get hooked to the characters/story you have to watch it through to the end. You have to be careful when you are buying the episodes because there are two or three versions of the seasons. Some versions divide it up into only three seasons, some four, and some include the mini movie special on a separate disc and others count it as a normal episode. As long as you get the discs from the same release you should end up with every show. The last season is a bit chaotic because they thought they were being cancelled and even tore down some of the set already, also Ray is replaced with an ""imposter"" for most of the season (which they explain). ""Ride forever"" is my favorite (a two parter) but there are several outstanding episodes in there. Benton and Dieff are so easy to love, and all the supporting characters do a great job  - especially ray and franchesca. The music is really well done as well. If you like Canada, Chicago, Cop dramas, or any clever fast talking comedies you should check out due south.",1208736000,2,1215,4.424107142857143

1960097,2,B0000YWKFO,"I have a hard time trusting the quality of a dvd release when the company can't even bother to package it with a photo of the correct actors.  The third season co-starred  Callum Keith Rennie (as Ray Kowalski) yet I don't see CKR on any of the packaging for this US release.  Its a simple matter to check & frankly makes me wonder what else suffered from laziness on this release.  (David Marciano only guest starred a couple of times in the season).

Also, it would be nice if the amazon editors would actually list the episodes included on this release.  Thankfully other reviewers give enough hints to figure out how this differs from the Canadian release (series 3 & 4) of the same episodes.  By the way, the Canadian release actually gets the packaging correct and features actor Rennie as he should be.",1196812800,5,808,4.569444444444445
1960098,2,B0000YWKFO,"On the basis of Paul Gross's work in ""Slings and Arrows"" (which I highly recommend), I plunked for all three seasons of this series. It's not bad, exactly, just not especially good either: the writing especially seems kind of pedestrian. The dynamic between the straight-arrow Mountie and the semi-slacker American detective seems forced, and the crime situations look like recycled ""T.J. Hooker"" episodes.",1194220800,,406,5.4603174603174605
1960099,5,B0000YWKFO,"I am at a loss to understand the confusions and quibbles of some of the reviewers of this final set of Due South CDs.  Paul Gross's portrayal of Benton Frazer is more refined than ever, and his new partner, Ray Kowalski, is played by Callum Keith Rennie to perfection.  Like Gross, Rennie is a master actor.  The two of them clearly formed a close bond making these episodes.  Their relationship as Benton and Ray undergoes a series of transformations right to the close of the final episode, perhaps one of the most open and perplexing and hopeful and beautiful closing episodes of any series, matched perhaps by the final episode of Six Feet Under in which quite the opposite occurs and every character's destiny is made perfectly clear.

The shifting from the first Ray to the second was a situational, contractural necessity.  The writers brilliantly turned it into a splendid plot twist, confusing Benton Frazer and the viewer quiet thoroughly for most of the first episode of the season - and then resolving the mystery as both silly and sinister and letting us get on with the season.

I commend to all who read this the other tv series and films in which either Paul Gross or Callum Keith Rennie appear.  Most of them are good films, and Gross and Rennie can even make the Grade B ones shine with their acting.  Happily, most of them are currently available.  Just search on Paul Gross or Callum Keith Rennie.

Canada has a thriving, first-rate film ""industry.""  We in the United States tend to remain ignorant of the great Canadian directors (such as Denis Arcand), writers (such as Paul Haggis) and actors (such as those in Due South and Slings and Arrows). Yes, you too, Draco, the masterful, hunky-husky canine actor who played Diefenbaker with a wolfy woof.

Maybe that's why the DVDs sell so inexpensively - their value is underrated to begin with.  Our loss if we ignore them; our great delight if we get to know them.

My Canadian brothers and sisters:  I thank you very kindly.

Writing this review reminds me of the time when, making our way north of Vancouver, my partner and I were on the track of - well, a story for another occasion.",1187568000,13,2155,4.658730158730159
1960100,2,B0000YWKFO,"If you enjoyed Seasons One and Two, do not watch Season Three.

1960101,4,B0000YWKFO,"As an Australian fan of this program with no hope of ever finding a Australian released version I jumped at the chance to get my hands on a copy to enjoy this fantastic program and I'll tell you right now I was not disappointed with the show in any way what so ever.  I was a little disappointed in the quality of the DVD transfer. It was a little like watching a high quality video but to be honest I knew it was going to be like that and given the price compared to the Canadian version and the fact it has ALL the episodes I would buy it again if I had to.  If you already have season one I can assure you it's better quality then that but not as good as you would expect from a fairly new release DVD.  Be that as it may if you are a fan of the show, don't have the money to buy the Canadian version, which is separate box sets of Season 3, Season 4 and a separate copy of the double episode finale, don't mind watching a slightly lower quality version and don't mind a box cover that isn't really designed for this season (the images are of the original Ray and of episodes from season One) then get to credit card out and buy this killed before it's time program.",1179100800,,1169,4.030172413793103

With the U.S. version of the DVD's though, don't get your hopes up when it comes to any extras because there aren't any.  The discs are about as plain as they come.  So as long as you aren't expecting anything other than the show itself, you won't be disappointed.  The picture quality is the same as when it first aired on television.  Other than that, the DVD's came out fine, just check to make sure nothing is wrong with the discs as some of them tend to shift during shipping.

I have heard that if you can afford it, get another country's version of the sets, such as the Canadian version, because it has better picture quality and it actually has extras on the DVD's.  I would have given the DVD's a five star rating had it had extras.",1171756800,3,814,4.246753246753247

True, the Canadian sets have difficult packaging (DVD overlay and spindles that require a lot of pressure before you can pop out the disk without risk of damage). True the first two Canadian season sets use the dreaded ""flipper"" (2-sided) disks. True what we saw in the US as a third season of 22 (missing four episodes, by the way) was produced and broadcast in Canada as two seasons of 13 each -- and the third and fourth DVD sets are released separately too. (Does the US ""third season"" set have all 26?) And most ironic truth of all: if I'd known that by waiting, I'd have gotten all three sets cheaper from an American distributor, I'd've taken that route too.

However -- the Canadian sets feature pristine transfers. (I've read that the US sets use videotape as the masters; I'm not sure where this info comes from, but it doesn't make sense that the masters would be any different than what the Alliance sets drew upon, since they license the material.) The Canadian sets feature disks running at the highest speed. (The American disks are single sided because they jam twice the normal amount of eps. per side, and run at a slower speed. That, it seems to me, would account for VHS-like resolution.) The Canadian sets, for whatever it's worth, do feature accurate packaging (the right cast members listed and featured in illustrations). And finally --

-- small thing though it may be --

-- the Caniadian Final (4th) Season set does have a small but utterly delightful extra. Paul Gross does a running commentary for both parts of CALL OF THE WILD. I can live without most commentary tracks I hear, but this is one you'll return to. It's witty, wryly funny and thoughtfully observed.

I won't tell you not to save the dough on the American release, I empathize ... I'll only tell you, the Canadian sets have more vibrant sound and video. And in the end, it's what's ON the DVD that matters the most ... isn't it?",1139097600,51,2091,4.612903225806452
1960115,4,B0000YWKFO,"Apparently I didn't read enough of the reviews because at least one of the reviews I read lead me to believe that this was the complete third season as it was seen in the US-it's not.  Part of the confusion is because of the difference between the Canadian and US broadcast seasons.  In the US, the show only had three seasons-I was expecting the full 26 episodes, especially given the inflated price of the set (I second another reviewer-you can find a cheaper source than Amazon).

Despite what another reviewer indicated, it does NOT include the four episodes that weren't shown in the US the first time around, since they are all part of the ""4th Season"" (is Amazon shuffling it's reviews or something?)

So a warning to all-this set only has the 13 episodes that comprised the _Canadian_ 3rd season:

41: Burning Down the House

42: Eclipse

43: I Could's Been a Defendant

44: Strange Bedfellows

45: Mountie and Soul

46: Bounty Hunter

47: Seeing is Believing

48: Spy vs Spy

49: Dead Guy Running

50: Perfect Strangers

51: Asylum

52: Mountie on the Bounty 1

53: Mountie on the Bounty 2

Bonus-Pilot Episode

And a final Plea to Amazon-I've submitted this as a suggestion so many times my fingers are bleeding, so if anyone else wants to take up the call: INCLUDE THE @#@$#!%$@# EPISODE LISTS IN TV-DVD DESCRIPTIONS!!!!!",1138060800,66,1332,4.688311688311688
1960116,3,B0000YWKFO,"There are two camps in the DS fandom: those who fangirl the ""real"" Ray from the first two seasons (played by David Marciano) and those who adore Ray Kowalski (Callum Keith Rennie) from the last season. This DVD set is the last, third season (as seen in the US, instead of broken into two seasons as it was in other countries) and depending on which camp you fall into, you'll either love it or hate it.

The DVDs themselves are only of average quality, not really what you'd expect from a professional DVD release. More like something that you'd find on VHS. There aren't any good features, either, and CKR is nowhere to be found on the box. But on the other hand, the entire third season is here. No having to buy a whole other box set just to get the last few eps.

As for the show itself, it definitely took a different turn in the last season. I thought it started taking itself less seriously in most eps (there were exceptions for character development) and with Paul Gross at the helm as both actor and producer, it took more chances. Supernatural story lines (not out of the realm of believability, considering that the ghost of Fraser's dead father has been hanging around since the first season), Fraser becoming a bit more ""superhero-like"" in his abilities (which I saw as tongue-in-cheek, not bad writing), and most definitely a nod to fans of slash with major subtext between Fraser and Kowalski. (Something that pleased CKR fans, but made ""real"" ray fans do Linda Blair _Exorcist_ impressions; major split in the fandom.)

Paul Gross put more fun in the third season and yes, the writing could get wacky, as could the acting, but they were all having fun and if you look at it from that angle, you get a good laugh out of it. The finale is probably one of the best parts (aside from the two-part ""Mountie on the Bounty""). It took that wackiness to a new level with the ""resolutions"" of the characters (the actors got to decide how they wanted their characters to end up), and best of all (depending on your view point), Fraser and Kowalski actually do ride off into the sunset together. In a dog sled. With Stan Rogers' ""Northwest Passage"" playing in the background.

Sweet? Funny? Just plain bad? It's all a matter of opinion, but whichever you choose, it's not dull. Due South never failed to be exciting and surprising, and the third season was a good example.",1137283200,52,2377,4.5597189695550355
1960117,3,B0000YWKFO,"I found out about the domestic release of Due South on Amazon.com, and rushed out to buy all three seasons. The Canadian box sets are $80 Canadian, so buying all four seasons from Canada is an expensive proposition. The American release costs a third of that, and contains the pilot to boot, which wasn't included until the Season 3 box set in Canada.

Due South followed the misguided adventures of Benton Fraser, a constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as he tracked his father's killers to Chicago. After closing the case, his Canadian superiors advised him to lie low, so he remains in Chicago as a liaison at the Canadian consulate and works cases with Ray Vecchio, Chicago cop, along with his deaf wolf Diefenbaker (named after a former Canadian Prime Minister). The Canadian/American and wilderness/city culture clash leads to some humorous moments along the way.

The picture quality is noticeably grainy since it was taken from videotape rather than the masters, but for the great price (I now have all the seasons for less than one season of the Canadian box set), it's a compromise that was worth it. Like the Canadian set, there are no extras, also no closed captioning. Menus are bare bones and include episodes and chapter menus (hardly ""interactive"" menus as stated on the box). The packaging is a big step from the clunky Canadian design, featuring an attractive foldout cardboard case with large photos of Ray, Benton, and Dief.

The DVDs are single sided, meaning easier handling. All 26 third season episodes are here, including the two part ""Mountie on the Bounty"" and two part series finale ""Call of the Wild."" Nicknamed ""The show that would not die,"" Due South was resurrected from the dead for the third season, when they were already destroying sets and many of the original cast had other work. David Marciano (Ray) was replaced by Canadian tough guy Callum Keith Rennie from Hard Core Logo. Marciano's absence was explained by having him on an undercover drug bust in Mexico, and Callum was a stand-in as Ray. Paul Gross took on the triple hats of actor, director, and producer, as well as doing most of his own stunts. And the show took a much darker, gritter, sexually charged tone in its final reincarnation. Citing reading Due South slash fiction (homoerotic fan fiction), Gross included elements (real or implied, your call) of homoerotic tension between Kowalski and Fraser, more violence, explicit songs on the soundtrack, and a less family friendly tone in general. My greatest disappointment was with the series finale, in which the storylines are wrapped up in an improbable, flippant way that insulted fans of the first two seasons. Et tu, Benton?

Hardcore fans will want the third season (originally split into two seasons in the US), but the best episodes are in the first two seasons with the ""real"" Ray. And what's up with the packaging? All the box art shows David Marciano instead of Callum Keith Rennie--not a major gripe, but inaccurate to say the least.",1137283200,36,3010,4.896078431372549
1960118,3,B0000YWKFO,"Ignore what the cover looks like, this is season three with CKR as Ray (Kowalski). And it's season three the way those of us in the US saw it, as one big season, not broken up into two seasons.

Once again, don't go looking for anything in the way of features; it's just the episodes and the quality could be better. But for the money and for the chance to finally have the season the way you saw it instead of having to buy two seperate sets, it's well worth getting.",1136851200,25,468,4.142857142857143
1960119,5,B0000YWKFO,"I'm confused by some of the reviews for this wonderful show.

I so far have only purchased the first two seasons, made by ""Platinum"" in Wisconsin.  The price was extremely reasonable for each, about $25.00 to $30.00 at Borders.  I do not understand the very high price shown for season 3 on Amazon. Why would that one season cost three times more than any of the others?

The packaging is very good in the two I own.

My only dissapointment is there are NO special features with either of the two seasons I bought. I got the episodes and nothing more.  Still, I'm thrilled to find this well made show on DVD!",1134432000,5,608,4.383928571428571
1960120,4,B0000YWKFO,"The VHS tape masters were used for the U.S. Platinum DVDs. The budget minded buyer can go for the cheaply mastered U.S. DVDs.

But those wanting quality will go for THIS much higher priced Canadian DVD from Alliance.  These are mastered for DVD by the production masters.  You can save alot of money by ordering them directly from Amazon's Canadian Division (click on the Canadian button at the bottom of this page).",1127865600,30,416,4.75
1960121,4,B0000YWKFO,"To clarify things - this is indeed the complete Third Season as it was seen internationally (i.e. everywhere but the USA). We in the US didn't get separate third and fourth seasons; we got a combined ""third"" season which was missing four episodes that were seen by everyone outside the US.

If this set had been the *incomplete* U.S. version of the ""third"" season, I for one would have been irate.

The four missing episodes, by the way, were Good for the Soul, Dead Men Don't Throw Rice, Say Amen, and Hunting Season.  These four weren't seen in the US until cable channel TNT aired reruns.

I received my set recently, but haven't been able to watch it yet. I do see that Alliance is still using the badly-designed cases, which irk me no end. However, they have advanced to single-sided discs with disc artwork, so that's a (small) improvement. I was really hoping that the Pilot movie would be on a separate disc, and that Mountie on the Bounty would be in the original two-hour format (as it was on the VHS), but I guess we can't have everything.

As far as the more inexpensive USA releases from Platinum Disc Corporation, I understand that they do not include the French audio and subtitle options that the Canadian releases do.  I'm not sure if they are captioned or subtitled in English; I do know that Platinum's release of Call of the Wild is not closed-captioned or subtitled in English.  I also wonder if they might have image quality issues due to over-compression, as the Canadian releases are on twice the number of discs.",1127520000,10,1537,4.608058608058608
1960122,3,B0000YWKFO,"I love Due South.  I love Paul Gross.  I love Callum Keith Rennie.  I kind of hated these discs.  First, they're ridiculously expensive, especially considering that this isn't even the full 3rd season, just the first half.  They're packaged poorly, with one disc overlapping another, which is just a big scratch waiting to happen.

Apparently, Alliance Atlantis has recently issued a new version of these discs, which is the entire 3rd season, including the last two episodes, ""Call of the Wild 1&2,"" which is available on its own for now.  This new version not only has the entire season, but it costs around $20 instead of $80.  However, Amazon doesn't carry it--people have only been able to find it in the Best Buy stores, not online.  I don't know who I should be frustrated with this about--Alliance Atlantis or Amazon.  I'm leaning towards being annoyed with Alliance Atlantis, since they have a history of not really caring whether or not fans of the show can have access to it on DVD.

So, for price and poor presentation, this lost two stars.  The content, however, is fantastic.  I love this show so much.  It's nothing like the hardboiled cop or crime scene shows on TV now.  It's much more innocent, delving occasionally into cheesy, but I can't help loving it because of the characters.  Paul Gross is fantastic as the repressed Mountie with issues the size of the Northwest Territories.  Callum Keith Rennie is one of my favorite actors, and when he came on to the show in the 3rd season as the tough-talking, tortured, romantic, Ray Kowalski, he introduced a dark edginess that had been lacking the first two seasons.

The alliteration in the last paragraph was completely accidental, by the way.

One day I'll find that $20 copy of season 3 with all the episodes on it, but until then, this will have to do.  Although, I recommend clicking on the ""used and new"" link over on the right instead of buying straight from Amazon.  I got a brand new copy for around $45, which is far better than $80.",1124064000,11,2011,4.672364672364672
