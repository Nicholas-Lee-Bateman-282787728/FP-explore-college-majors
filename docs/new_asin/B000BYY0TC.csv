2449590,4,B000BYY0TC,"A nice movie about a old man and his family, and fairly decent script. Ed Asner makes the thing believable.",1230422400,3,107,4.4
2449591,4,B000BYY0TC,This film made my mind review some of the interactions in my own family - I think we need to stop and look at things from the other guys point of view from time to time and just let them handle things in their own way.  This is perhaps the hardes cut of all - Asner was great in this film - well worth watching.,1218844800,4,311,3.7846153846153845
2449592,4,B000BYY0TC,"Young, self-absorbed attorney Matt Fleming (Jason London) is sent out of the city and into the woods by his mother, who is worried over the welfare of Matt's crusty, eccentric nature-loving grandfather Jack (Ed Asner). Not surprisingly, Matt is in for quite a culture shock. Not only does Jack do without any modern conveniences, but he also enjoys wandering in the great outdoors completely naked. Even worse -- at least as far as Matt is concerned -- Jack has spent the entire family fortune on a patch of land that he intends to donate to a local Native American child. In trying to curb Jack's enthusiasm and control the old man's behavior, Matt instead ends up learning about how to fend for himself in the wilderness, a skill that comes in very handy during a serious mid-film crisis. Matt also applies what he has learned from Jack in his efforts to make a lasting commitment to his own girlfriend Linda (Meredith Salenger). Produced for cable's Hallmark Channel, Out of the Woods debuted April 2, 2005.",1203984000,59,1010,4.777142857142858
2449593,2,B000BYY0TC,"This is a very strange movie.  It begins well enough and looks as if it might have some humor, then veers off into two less-than-appealing characters who we are told are grandfather and grandson.  We would never guess it otherwise.

The grandfather's behavior at first is just plain mean.  The grandson's is childish.  His behavior in the wilderness verges on ridiculous.  Okay, he's a city boy, but he's not stupid, nor hopelessly paranoid.  Neither is really a character.  Nor is there really a story.

This is an urbanite's Romantic dream of what life in the woods is like, complete with Rousseau's noble savages.  The movie is preachy, but worse, the ideas preached are hopelessly vague, a mixture of common sense, Eastern mysticism and Indian lore.

The changes in the relationship move in fits and starts without adequate cause.  There is also a totally unmotivated love interest.  And the big change at the end will leave you shaking your head in wonder.

One wonders again: Who writes these things?  And how did they get someone to put up several million dollars for this?  I am sure there are better books out there than this.  Why aren't they chosen for filming?

Suit yourself.  I was not warned before I bought this DVD, but you have been.",1202774400,7,1251,4.761682242990654
2449594,5,B000BYY0TC,"I felt this was an important movie for families and young people who think there is only one way to live and be successful.  When you follow the deepest part of the heart, a person can find success and happinest so rewarding that you really feel alive.  Happiness and sucess is not about money alone.  Ed Asner was gruff and often cruel, but sometimes that is what it takes to move us out of our comfort zone.  Its a great story that reminds people they can always make another choice.

This movie is all about making that which is deranged seem good. If children watch this one, it will help to screw up their minds. I do not think a reasonable adult can watch this without knowing that that whcih is right and valued is being twisted around (perverted) into seeming strange and that the strange is being promoted.

The only disappointment (very small) was the name ""Yodder"" of the mountain community, sounds more like Pennsylvania - Amish type name.  Again,  good casting,  strong acting and of course, beautiful scenery.  Wonderful family movie that does not have a ""Hollywood-type"" ending but a beautiful way to witness the end of life as not frightening but a gentle way one person chose to control his last moments.  Beautiful.",1393977600,,575,5.053191489361702

2449654,5,B000BYY0TC,"I watch this movie over and over again.  The story is great and certainly celebrates our differences in families, and how love is still a binding force that transcends all conflicts.  Ed Asner is definitely wonderful in this role.",1390694400,,230,4.871794871794871
2449664,5,B000BYY0TC,"The story is well documented, so I'll be brief. A family thinks that an estranged father/grandfather is wasting his fortune, and thereby the family's. The grandson, an attorney, is dispatched to serve papers giving the family Power of Attorney so that they can protect themselves from his elderly whims.

This movie makes its own way by creating tension in ways we don't often see in Hallmark movies. The writers did a good job of presenting provocative bits of wisdom without being preachy and self-assured. The grandfather (Ed Asner), dispenser of the wisdom, is humanly flawed. The grandson's role comes through as much more than the shallow caricature it could have been. He is annoyed at his grandfather's odd ways but deals with him as difficult family rather than an opponent to be defeated.

The relationship is built slowly but at a well designed pace that leaves the viewer rooting for both men. I got a lot out of this movie, and I hope you will too.

Highly recommended.",1390176000,,982,4.833333333333333

So when Matt drives up to see him in his flashy BMW, Jack confiscates the keys and the distributor so that Matt is marooned in the woods. This is a simple moral tale of living frugally.

I believe that The christmas card  and out of the woods are two of the best family movies
that have ever been made.  They are humerous as well as having a great story to tell.",1322265600,,268,4.215686274509804
2449699,2,B000BYY0TC,"This movie looked great from the cover and short description on the back.  But honestly, it was not that good.  They had the potential to do so much with the storyline and idea, but instead it was cheesy and unimaginative.

Matt Fleming is a lawyer from a rich family.  He has a pretty girlfriend, and the high life, but he's just not very happy.  When his mother asks him to go visit his grandpa before all their inheritance is spent, he doesn't think much of it and travels out there.  But Grandpa has a few other ideas.  He disables Matt's car and locks the papers inside, then he shuts himself in his cabin (he just bought a property with 200+ acres and will be buying more land).  Matt has to spend the night outside on the porch.  For this city boy it is not a good way to go, he hates the outdoors and seemingly everything with it and definitely is not overly pleased with his grandfather.  But after awhile, and a certain girl that delivers groceries, he may be able to change his mind.

Characters:

Edward Asner-Jack Green (Grandpa)
Jason London-Matt Fleming
Gwen-Missy Crider

There are other characters but they don't play as large a role as these three.  Honestly, all of these characters were very unbelievable.  They were too much in one direction or the other and just didn't seem like real people.  I was hoping that Matt would be killed off rather quickly he was so annoying and idiotic.  I mean honestly, the guy acts like a raspberry isn't something he's ever encountered before and even being a city boy that's largely ridiculous.  The other characters had these same things that made them feel like they were just there to fill a role instead of being normal.

The whole plot felt rushed.  There was too dramatic of a change for Matt too fast and no real reasons are given for any of the motivations in this movie.  It just felt contrived and forced.  I did like that it was about family and returning to things simpler, it just wasn't executed very well.  That being said, there was nothing inappropriate with this movie and it would be fine to watch as a family movie.  I wish I would have enjoyed it more, but it just wasn't going to work for me I guess.  More character development and less rush might have made this movie worth watching.

2449719,5,B000BYY0TC,There are some actors/actresses that are so selective of the parts they portray that you can always feel safe viewing them.  Ed Asner is just such an actor.  And he does not fail to come through in this story of a grandfather and his grandson coming to know and love each other.  Glad to add this to my collection.  Found it at amazon.com while searching for another Asner film.,1297296000,,378,4.434782608695652
2449720,4,B000BYY0TC,"This moving has a good story line.  The Ed Asner character has some swearing, if you can overlook it, it is a good film.  Not recommended for younger viewers, under 12.",1287446400,,168,4.387096774193548
2449721,4,B000BYY0TC,"I really enjoyed this movie for many reasons:  Ed Asner, beautiful scenery, good acting, and great lessons in a slice of life!",1279065600,,126,4.7272727272727275
2449722,5,B000BYY0TC,This was a rally good movie with a great meaning behind it. Ed Asner of Mary Tyler Moore fame played a grandpa dying of cancer. His grandson is to try to get him to sign papers so his mother could have the old man's property and put the old man away. As the film unfolds you learn quite a few lessons in love and understanding. It's really good. I loved it and the price was a good one.,1277337600,,386,3.9615384615384617
2449723,2,B000BYY0TC,"""Out Of The Woods"" Could have been a great show. Ed Asner is a great actor whom I have enjoyed for many years, as well as Mel Harris being in the line-up, (who was in it for a grand total of 2 scenes). The scenery was beautiful and it started out looking like it would have a good ""moral lesson"" involving the materialism of today verses the simple life involving hard work and depth of character, but it missed the boat in my opinion. The Dove Foundation Family Approved award is a little odd to me, using their own words ""Our standards and criteria are based on Judeo/Christian values"" in yet many religious symbol were shown very pointedly in this movie, with the final  summary stating something similar to ""If you go to the Spirit Father and he is pleased with you, He may make you young again"". The writing is confusing also, as the mother (Mel Harris) sends her son to get a signature on the land from the grandfather (Ed Asner) basically giving her Power of Attorney, because she thought he was crazy to be living in the woods ~ but in the end when things change, involving her son basically doing the same thing, doesn't seem upset in the least. Bottomline, this show is not written in a ""believable"" manner, and although they were attempting to have a positive message in a materialistic world, I do not think this movie will give many people pause to think. In my opinion, it just is not written with ""follow-thru"" on the characters, which in turn does not involve a viewer to care about the characters, which is essential in a movie to make it a winner.",1276041600,6,1565,4.452961672473868
2449724,5,B000BYY0TC,"It was a wonderful movie.  I love Ed Asner.  I am glad that there are still great movies written out there for fine actors that we have grown up with.  The story shows that the wisdom of the ""old ways"" have so much more to give us than the way the world is today.  There are so many movies that only entertain at best but you don't really have anything to walk away from them with. This was a beautiful movie, funny and very family friendly.  We will watch it again.",1263686400,3,466,4.076923076923077

After being stranded with his grandfather, Matt advnetageously discovers a whole different way of life, free of the stress of the life as a lawyer he has come to accept as normal.",1256083200,6,522,4.853932584269663

Ed Asner played the Grandfather of a spoiled city boy (Jason)who had everything even a mother who sent her son (Jason) to his Grandfather to get everything signed over to her.  She was plainly out to get everything her Father had.  Changing his thoughts of how life could be lived  was not easy for Jason but he found with the help of a special girl, his Granfather and his Grandfathers true Indian friends how satisfying life could be if lived with love in your heart as will as with the thoughts in your head.

8094543,5,B000BYY0TC,"A classic story of a young adult getting into trouble being sent to relatives to shape up. Only this story is one that teens, young adults, and older adults can learn from and relate to. Ed Asner is outstanding in his role as the grandfather. Jason London plays the struggling irresponsible son who can't seem to get his life in order. So his mother sends him to ""check"" on his grandfather. It is a journey that is probably familiar to many of us, but one that bears repeating and learning from.

8094546,5,B000BYY0TC,One of those movies you see one night and sit through when you are bored only to get to the end of it and say to yourself dang that was good. You spend hours of your life channel surfing and every once in awhile you come across a movie you never saw or even heard of and see it on t.v. and find yourself looking for a copy on DVD because you want to see if again. This is one of those movies. You can read the synopsis of the movie elsewhere but in my mind it is one of the better movies I have seen in a long while. It makes me want to find a cabin in the woods somewhere and get one of those silly hats they wore in the movie.,1431388800,3,628,3.6940298507462686
