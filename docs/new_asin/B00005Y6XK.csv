1675252,4,B00005Y6XK,"Plot Summary: when a station that is searching for signs of intelligent life gets a signal, the owner of the facility, an engineer, a reporter, and a ""new age"" minister go to investigate. They find the site abandoned and signs of a violent struggle. Then, Colonel Garrett (Louis Gossett Jr.) shows up and demands a piece of the action. It is up to them to determine what happened and figure out what to do with the signal.
Random thought #1: Our new age minister, Reverend Fletcher (Jefferson Mappin), portrays a stereotypical ""new ager"". He ""witnesses"" to computer nerd Jack Jones (Judd Nelson) about the importance of accepting a ""higher power"" into his life. He has an interesting mix of theology. Once, he even refers to God as ""he or she"".
Random thought #2: Smitty Turner (Michelle Nolden) is the manager of the search project. She is a saved Christian. It is clear from the movie that she does not believe in intelligent life on other planets. I am rather curious why she chose this particular career path.
Random thought #3: Like most ""sci fi"" movies that take place in the present day, this movie seems to have been created by people with little understanding of computers. The computers were able to display a visual representation of the signal and were able to pipe it through headphones, but couldn't save it? Sorry .... but this just doesn't make sense.
Random thought #4: Why is it that Cloud Ten is convinced that psychic abilities will be present in the end times? Apocalypse III and IV both featured it and in this movie, there is a mysterious Lieutenant Vasquez (Ramona Milano) who is able to move things with her mind. I think there will be some people disappointed if, after the rapture, millions of people don't suddenly start bending spoons with their minds. ;)
Random thought #5: This movie is not particularly an ""end times"" work. There is a Bible verse at the very end from 2 Timothy 3, but this is the only mention of the end times. This movie does not take place during the tribulation. It does, however, feature a ""WNN"" network, as seen in the Apocalypse series.
Recommendation: I enjoyed this movie. It is certainly a good one to have in your library. It is also probably a good for witnessing to unsaved friends or family members who are into the occult or new age.",1017619200,3,2296,4.657635467980295

1675305,4,B00005Y6XK,"Sci-fi/paranormal thriller based on SETI Home & U.S. military paranormal experimentation -- almost all the action takes place in a privately-owned observatory in the Sierra Nevadas. Compares well with the Hollywood movie, ""Contact."" Surprisingly, I liked it a lot up until the end ...

Besides the obvious ""Contact"" comparison, ""Deceived"" seems to me like a grown-up version of Bill Meyers' ""Forbidden Doors"" (a series of novels for Christian teens which I LOVE & I wish someone would make movies out of THOSE), but (to me) ""Deceived"" seems to lose something by the end ...

Can't quite put my finger on it, although I must say that I enjoyed the movie A LOT more than I thought I would. (I THOUGHT it was going to be hopelessly hokey.) I do agree with the basic premise, though -- & that's why I mentioned the ""Forbidden Doors"" series ...",1166918400,5,839,4.739726027397261

1675308,2,B00005Y6XK,"*sigh*...It came so close! Sometimes it seems like it is so difficult to find worthy Christian entertainment we will go to great lengths to be tolerant of near mediocrity.

I will start with the major disappointment of this film: it could have been SO much better with just a little tweaking. Here we have a film with high profile actors and a big budget for Cloud Ten, so much potential in the story line, and it falls short because the script is poorly developed.

As for the story, I'll set aside tragically incorrect assumptions of pre-tribulation rapture for now.  The premise that alien encounters and paranormal activity are demonically driven is an important one to get across and should make for more compelling cinema than this example.

The casting was for the most part exceptional (Judd Nelson and Louis Gossett Jr, wow!).  The dialogue for the most part was formula but okay, and some of the techno aspects lacked polish or were downright hokey. The initial lab sequence had some cool set features and lighting, good suspense and it grabbed.  But it was downhill from there.

Some of the acting was really good, but too often the characters were caricaturized to such an extent that the actors struggled to make them believable. In the case of the preacher, I think he just gave up or had no idea who he was supposed to be. The hearing impairment aspect of the Jack character wasn't very well done. For one so profoundly deaf that turning down his hearing aid resulted in total silence, he exhibited none of the traits of deafness with any consistency.

The whole idea of gathering these particular characters together for a trek to the observatory/lab to hear a mysterious signal from outer space was awkward and flimsy.  Viewers shouldn't be asking themselves questions like:  is this really how it would be done were such a thing discovered?

When will filmmakers learn it's all in the details?  An intelligent high-profile anchorperson would not walk around the Sierras in stillettos, period.  Was the caricature-minister supposed to be a new age Enlightenment guru, a backwoods Southern preacher, or a bigtime televangelist?  If the former, he should have sported a caftan or something, and dropped the preachy fake Southern aspect of the character. There was nothing cohesive in his speech, appearance or demeanor. It was as if they were trying to shove everything negative about church leadership into a ""one world religion"" character and it just didn't work.

When the cast walked into a dark empty lab out in the middle of nowhere they were weirdly ""put out"" - NO sense of suspense or alarm, and no real concern for the missing people even though the place was ransacked and there was a message in blood smeared on the wall! Come on, this is not how people would react in a situation like that... not even self absorbed, worldly unbelievers.

And etc.  I liked the Jack and Smitty relationship, the paranormal experiments were very well done, and the spiritual disintegration of the characters contrasting with the awakening of Jack was great.

I really hated the hamster / desk scene.

By the way, the website could win academy awards, and the DVD extras were fun to watch.

1675310,5,B00005Y6XK,"While promising to open the door to an entirely new type of warfare, a top-secret Pentagon experiment designed to unleash paranormal powers suddenly goes wildly out of control.

Meanwhile, an observatory in the Sierra Nevada Mountains receives a confirmed extraterrestrial signal. With evidence that the two are somehow connected, Colonel David Garrett (LOUIS GOSSET JR.) rushes to the Observatory with his team of commandos.

The billionaire who funded the Observatory gathers his own team, led by brilliant computer expert Jack Jones (JUDD NELSON, The Breakfast Club, New Jack City). Wanting to share the news of this unique event with the world news organizations, the two teams attempt to verify its source. As the beam is repeatedly received and recorded at the Observatory, the tension among the teams mounts. And those who have heard the beam become obsessed and dangerous.

The signal has a dark secret -- and an even more ominous source. Before long, envy, lust and greed explode and create a sinister world of obsession and murder. There is only one way out of this disaster, but even if the team believes it, they may remain deceived.

The approach was subtle, yet some of the dialogue came accross as canned, or even thinly veiled speech-making.

1675339,5,B00005Y6XK,"WOWSERS!!!! We are talking beyond WOW here!
This is a MUST watch!!!!...I have always been a scifi fan loving movies that can hold you on the edge of your seat with things from out of this world. But lately, it seems Hollywood thinks that it takes sex, nudity, and profanity to hold people to their seats. So I had given up on my favorite genre of movies..... that is until now!
Decieved uses more than just special effects to hold you. The characters have depth and carry you through the movie from beginning to end. They have made the good vs. evil movie into one with characters that you can love and some that I know I was moved to extremely dislike. They hold you right until the end with this one!
Cloud Ten Pictures and Andre van Heerden did their best job yet with this film and I really look forward to seeing more things like this come from this great Canadian film company...While they really drew my attention with their movie Revelation...this one just broke through all the boundaries and brought forth a movie that has quickly become my favorite movie! I've bought the video and have watched it over and over and still will watch it again! And I will be buying copies to give to friends and relatives because it is such a powerful film that watching it just once isn't enough!
I do hope that Hollywood stands up and takes notice. You can have a good movie without the sex and language that keep so many movies out of the homes because the kids can't watch them. Some of us adults are tired of Hollywood thinking that we are too stupid to look beyond the sex and 'hip' language to find a film that actually has some great value to it and a real story also. And how great it was to see ""Smitty"" a Christian woman not made to appear stupid, foolish, or a prude. Judd Nelson, a self confessed computer geek, made me proud to be one myself! And Lou Gossett Jr gave the performance of his career in my opinion.
Hollywood take notice!
If you are looking for a good thriller with romance, comedy, and strong characters and a good story line, that you are not afraid of who might enter the room while you are watching it, then I strongly recommend that you rent or buy Decieved today! You won't be disappointed and you may walk away with a new appreciation for a solid story line and a few good basic principles in life!",1019779200,15,2325,4.371824480369515
1675340,5,B00005Y6XK,"Is there intelligent life on other planets? That's the sci-fi theme of Deceived, latest project from Cloud Ten Pictures. ''Intense'' is the word to describe Deceived. Political intrigue, personal greed and authentic faith are stirred together in explosive proportions when principal players are trapped in a space observatory. The human relationships and conflicts are as explosive as the plot's circumstances. Billionaire Emmett Shaw (played by Stewart Bick) claims personal ownership of a signal he believes is coming from extraterrestrial life. He assembles an unlikely crew including computer guru Jack Jones (Judd Nelson), an investigative reporter, and a arrogant radio preacher who is also Shaw's spiritual mentor. Shaw's party travels to the Sierra Nevadas observatory (funded largely by Shaw) with plans to break history's biggest story ever. Upon arrival, they discover that their on-site technicians are missing and the project has been sabotaged. After Col. David Garrett (Lou Gossett, Jr.) arrives from the Pentagon, a violent storm traps the group in the observatory, and a test of wills ensues because both Garrett and Shaw are accustomed to being in charge. The dilemma addressed in Deceived reveals how human nature may lead to compromise and rationalization in order to achieve selfish ends. With the gripping story of Deceived, Cloud Ten Pictures continues to advance the company's reputation for excellent drama presented in the context of a moral worldview. This one gives movie buffs reason to look forward to more work from Cloud Ten.",1019779200,3,1557,5.464730290456432

7956728,3,B00005Y6XK,"Released to video in 2002 and directed by Andre Van Heerden, ""Deceived"" is a sci-fi/drama in the mold of 1997's ""Contact"" or 2003's ""Alien Hunter"" except that it's decidedly a 'B' production with several comic book caricatures rather than characters. Although, thankfully, there are a few likable and realistic characters, like the ones played by Michelle Nolden and Judd Nelson. The story centers around seven people who meet at a remote observatory in the mountains after contact from (presumably) space has finally been made. But something weird and eerie is going on and they might not make it out alive.

While this is a Christian production, the ideology doesn't become a factor in the story until the third act and it ties into the reality behind the strange phenomena happening at the observatory. The production quality is akin the the typical comic booky Syfy movie, but without any palpable monster. As noted above, at least three of the characters are over-the-top caricatures -- the new ager masquerading as a reverend (Jefferson Mappin), the colonel (Louis Gossett Jr.) and the hot reporter (Deborah Odell). Stewart Bick and Ramona Milano complete the main cast.

There are kinks in the script that needed worked out and so the story flow is uneven at times and lacks suspense build-up. But I liked the confined environment and the interplay between the characters. All the main actors (not the peripheral ones) take the material seriously and give their best, despite some campy elements, which was the script's issue, not the actors.

Several other things impressed me. For one, this ain't no conventional Christian movie. Despite its low-budget, it's ambitious and has a unique plot. The three females cast members are all beautiful in their own way, with Ramona standing out, but they're each exquisite. The images of Kara (Odell) holding a candle in the dark tunnel are striking.

Then there's the interesting way the Reverend is depicted: At first glance you'd think he's a Southern Baptist preacher, but it becomes clear that this isn't the case. He's a New Ager, but he's not really a hypocrite in that he really believes what he says and is even shown practicing what he preaches, which isn't to say that he's without flaws. He's obviously a glutton, for instance. Speaking of which, it seems like the screenwriter tried to implement the seven deadly sins into the story but, if so, it was half-hearted. Lastly, as cited above, the character of Smitty and her possible relationship with the computer geek, Jack, is compelling. Smitty is the sole Christian character and I like the way she's portrayed as sincere, but flawed; and walking in some morally-conflicting situations, like working for Shaw (Bick), a company whose goal contradicts her belief system.

The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in Toronto, Canada, substituting for the Sierra Nevadas in California.
