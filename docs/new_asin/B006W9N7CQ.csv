8505457,3,B006W9N7CQ,"I just discovered Michelle's workouts recently and while I really love her innovative and different Strength moves,her Cardio moves remind me why I dropped out of Jazzercise classes 35 years ago/she moves so fast that my feet can never catch up and some moves are downright silly. I would give this 5 stars if it were for Strength moves only. I also don't like how she has you do cardio while using heavy weights-as an Instructor she should know better. I also find her personality slightly irritating-like she tries to act cutesy and motivate but falls short. I usually do my own cardio moves while she's doing her silly awkward moves and play my own music which helps me get through. I also don't like repeating each move twice-I have always found that repetitive-I like to do the move once and say goodbye to it!!",1512000000,,816,4.63448275862069
8505458,4,B006W9N7CQ,I love it the only thing movements are too fast ! She changes very fast from exercise to another but it really works and I sweat a lot! Is too soon to give a complete review about its results. Later I'll post,1493683200,,208,3.9761904761904763
8505459,5,B006W9N7CQ,Challenging and fun.  This workout will really make you sweat.  I find it to be more challenging than her first peak dvds.  If you want to burn a lot of calories...buy this!!,1346976000,,174,4.375
