8118319,5,B000F6ZBV2,"I have long been interested and fascinated in the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash incident/story. I have kept an open mind about it neither completely agreeing that it was a UFO which crashed, or it wasn't one. I have read a number of reports and books about this incident, as well as other supposed incidents.
Something did happen in Roswell during that July night weather  it was of an Alien nature is for you to decide. This DVD is very well presented and documented. It gives undoubted facts and explanations to the Roswell incident and seems very creditable. It does ""tie"" up a lot of loose ends regarding this incident, but then it does, as well, open up thought to weather what the government is saying holds any truth.
An ""open-minded"" person should understand a number of facts, such as the year this incident occurred; the tensions between the USA and the USSR during that time; the "" need"" for the US Air Force to conduct secret high altitude tests due to the growing ""tensions"" ; the reality that many substantial UFO sightings had occurred throughout history, and still continue to this day; and if there is one thing in nature we, as humans should understand, is that Nature does replicate its ""life"" on this world and others, hence we should not ""close"" our minds to such realities as UFOs and Aliens.
This DVD has been made very professionally and is definitely a good addition to any student's UFO library.",1351641600,,1421,4.684
