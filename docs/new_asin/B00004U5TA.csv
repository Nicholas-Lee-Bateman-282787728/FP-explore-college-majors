7923674,2,B00004U5TA,"I am a long-time San Diego Chargers fan and I do not see why anyone would want to buy this video. The 2000 San Diego Chargers were absolutely terrible. The Chargers had terrible players, coach Mike Riley stunk, and the 2000 Chargers only won 1 single game the whole season defeating the Kansas City Cheifs 17-16. The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 star is because a still like the Chargers and believe that they have a great future ahead of them. Ultimately, their is absolutely no reason to buy this movie after such a horrible, and disgraceful season for the San Diego Chargers.",1045440000,2,604,4.5
7923675,5,B00004U5TA,Excellent video for the Charger fan.  Shows Mike Riley laying down a foundation for a solid Chargers future.  Video features plenty of  highlights as well from the 1999 season.  Great video to watch!,967939200,,199,4.9393939393939394
