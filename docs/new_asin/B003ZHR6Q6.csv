4233743,3,B003ZHR6Q6,"DC has a long and interesting history but this 'documentary' skips over most of the really interesting stuff and offers up a bland overview instead. I guess that's to be expected as this is a DC product but a little more depth would have been nice. It would have been terrific to see some featurettes added to acknowledge the ghost artists who did the bulk of the work on Bob Kane's Batman comics, the DC case against Captain Marvel comics, etc. Instead, we get a 90 minute promo video that barely scratches the surface.",1291161600,3,520,4.542553191489362
4233744,5,B003ZHR6Q6,"I'm not a huge comic buff, but I found ""Secret Origin"" riveting.  I had never considered how comics have changed over the years to reflect the times.  The film carefully narrated the 75 year history of DC, along with the evolutions not only of the characters, but of the writers and society around them.  You could see that the writers interviewed believed passionately in their art form and the characters they create.  The movie has a huge scope, encompassing nearly a century of American history.  The graphics, photos and film clips tell the story in an attractive and compelling way.  All in all, an amazing story.  I can't wait to watch it again!",1290729600,3,652,4.716814159292035
4233745,3,B003ZHR6Q6,"What can I say? I'm a sucker for most DC stuff. I buy all the DC DVDs because I hope they'll eventually release something I like. (Like a JSA Animated Feature.) But just cause I have to buy it doesn't mean you have to.

I paid $20 for this, and I was disappointed. It's just 90 minute documentary about DC Comics, and sadly I didn't really learn anything new. Then again, I am a well informed DC fan, so there is certainly some good information for those people who aren't as ""hardcore"" as me. They go over the ""behind the scenes origins"" of the major characters: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, with some mentions about the Silver Age Flash and Green Lantern. Then they talk about Alan Moore, Swamp Thing, Watchmen, Neil Gaiman and Sandman. And about some of the creators, like Gardner Fox, Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, Siegel, Shuster, and Bob Kane. Plus the founding of DC comics. Oh, and it's narrated by future-Green-Lantern, Ryan Reynolds.

It's okay, but it's the type of thing I would have liked to watch on TV for free than pay $20 for it. I suggest waiting until it's worth $13 or less if you feel the need to add it to your collection.

There's no extras either, just subtitles.

I should also point out that this documentary is also included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Beyond-The-Complete-Series-Limited-Edition/dp/B003XMZVHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Beyond: The Complete Series (Limited Edition)</a>.

4233749,3,B003ZHR6Q6,"When a media company gives you an ""inside look"" into its organization, it rarely happens to be a more than a promotional piece for its products.  Do you really expect DC to give a critical self-examination of its history?  Do you think they'll make any mention of such issues as Siegel and Shuster's and their heirs struggle to regain control over Superman, or Alan Moore's struggles with DC over Watchmen, and his eventual falling out?

No, the true origins of DC Comics will remain a secret, as far as DC is concerned.  Look at the trailer and count the number of clips from the various movies and tv shows.  This video exists to expose the viewer to as many of DC's properties as possible within 90 minutes, so that the consumer will want to run out and buy them all (it's no coincidence that Ryan Reynolds, the star of the upcoming Green Lantern movie, narrates).

It is not ""The Story of DC Comics"".  It's not a documentary.  It's marketing fluff.  When was the last time you paid for a commercial?",1286928000,47,1003,4.527777777777778

4233759,5,B003ZHR6Q6,"As I've mentioned in other comic book reviews, I love origin stories. I like knowing where the characters originally came from, and I love reading new origin stories when they inevitably get rewritten.

This, however, shows us not just the origin stories of various characters, but of the people who created those characters and created the business that keeps Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and many others alive and kicking.

We meet artists, writers, and more. I'm not going to give more details here because I want you to borrow, rent or buy your own copy. It is worth watching several times.

4233766,4,B003ZHR6Q6,"While, as most other reviewers have pointed out, this does look back over the history of DC through very rose colored lenses, it is still an entertaining watch. Also, there are some great points in this (Neil Gaiman's closing remarks is probably my favorite one) that make it worth watching at least once. I'm a lifelong comic fan and love the history of the medium as much as the comics themselves so this was fun for me. What made it even better was getting to share this with my kids. After watching it, my son actually said, ""I have always liked comics but I never realized how cool comics really are."" So, give it a watch on watch instantly at least or, if you're a comic nut like I am, just go ahead and add it to your collection for yourself and future generations.",1411516800,,772,4.368055555555555
4233767,5,B003ZHR6Q6,"Secret Origins is a title that plays on the idea that comics have an origins story that explains the genesis of heroes and superhero groups. So what you get here is a well edited 90 minute story of the ups & downs of DC Comics as its products evolve with history and current events.
  Although not intended as documentary of the year for the hardcore comics reader, a casual fan like myself comes to understand; why the Jewish immigrant value of social justice was introduced, along with- how the feminist ideals of Gloria Steinem and AfroAmerican representations in the view of Milestone creater Dwayne McDuffies were botched and redressed.
  So its narrative is clear and focused and somewhat candid regarding how the comics seek to entertain and inspire, lose relevance, update for new realities, perhaps lose their way for being too gritty, then reboot to tell any kind of story for literate adults while regaining the initial heroic ideals. This story unfolds through the creation of new titles as well as the retooling of classic favorites like Superman. So despite some mean spirited criticism against this dvd, I would argue that as a story it links CLEARLY & CONCISELY all its representations in the media to the evolution of social thinking: you get a reasoned explanation for the birth of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Marvel Comics, the Silver Age, Vertigo, Wildstorm, Milestone, as well as how each tv show and movie is stitched to a newfound relevance and popularity. In that way it legitimizes the origins part of the title and validates its 75 year career as no small feat: at many given intervals, DC could have folded from lackluster fan interest and competing hobbies. So this reveals a few warts, (like Dennis O'Neil admitting he botched Wonder Woman, the self-censoring code that cost 75% sales, the dehumanizing depiction if minorities and women, etc. ) while championing the time-honored intent to find new young talent to revitalize the brand: THAT is the heroic proto-American story arch that any company of intellectual property and imagination probably deserves to highlight after 4 or 5 decades of existence. This timeless quest for stories for the young at heart by the next wave of fresh, insightful minds is a journey well told in the voices of the true life characters of the DC story.",1406937600,,2319,4.938461538461539

4233777,3,B003ZHR6Q6,"To be upfront, I'm in my early 50's - and love the older superheros thing - since the mid-80's I don't like how things are drawn or the stories. So - The first hour of this Documentary is pretty interesting, shows some of Bill Gaines - who I love as he was Mad Magazine. Many things I didn't know about the history of comic books and facts. - Mostly an over-view. - I would rate the first hour at a 4.5 stars.
Then comes the last half hour - it turns to the modern (crappy) days of the comics - that you couldn't give to me. - Clearly promoting it. And starts to go off into racial things that do NOT interest me. I forget the guys name - but they go into some freaky - stooped over long haired nut - another one who ruins the older styles. It tried to paint a bright and hopeful future for DC and other comic book heros. I say - it all died years ago.
One of my favorites was Bizarro Superman - from the start to the mid-80's. It doesn't even mention him. So the final half hour I'd give a half a star - just cause they did 'something'. So - if you're like me - watch the first hour  then forget the rest.  Scott MacNeil.",1339977600,,1122,3.9601769911504423
4233778,4,B003ZHR6Q6,"I checked this out from my local public library the other night and was pleasantly suprised at how candid and un-infomercialish (well, until the last 10 minutes or so) it was, particularly considering it was generated by the Time Warner monolith. The format is about what you'd expect -  interviews with various comic book giants (Neil Gaiman, Mark Waid, Neal Adams, Denny O'Neil, etc.), archival footage/photos of same, clips from various films and TV shows featuring DC characters, photos of comics covers and art, and so forth. Not much to write home to Mom about, but if this life-long comic book geek and trivia nut learned a thing or two from it, you almost certainly will, too.

Great men and women who are keeping alive this medium and bringing in new and extraordinary things for all of us fans to enjoy.

Being a fan of comics books, love both DC and Marvel, very happy with any documentary letting me into their world...expect Marvel would or has done the same thing.  Believe we should all let this organization have their day in the sun.

As a collector, I would still purchase this DVD,  However, mostly to see some of the rare archival footage and newly recorded interviews with comics veterans.  As one reviewer pointed out...Stan Lee built a career out of misrepresenting himself to the unknowing public.  So what's the problem with some other reviewers on this DVD release!

That's part of the ""Schtick"", (is a Yiddish term meaning, a contrived and often used bit of business that a performer uses to steal attention), plus we enjoyed the storytelling and artwork of DC, took us out of everyday life, into a world of adventure through the days of GOLDEN AGE, SILVER AGE COMICS and THE BRONZE AGE, which reinvented itself over and over again.

No special features, this is a downer, but not necessarily a lost cause for the DVD...if you're a hardcore collector and fan, this is a must have for your every growing collection....very much recommend.

4233781,5,B003ZHR6Q6,"I read the reviews before I made this purchase...and I did my best to listen to what all the reviewers had to say. However, I have to wonder if some of the reviewers actually watched this, particularly the more negative ones. Yes, there are stories and histories that have been repeated in some form ad nauseum, but there were interesting spins that made them well worth hearing again. Yes, they glossed over (didn't mention) the fall-out between Siegel & Shuster and DC, but that legal battle is in part still going, so it was probably wise to let it be. But, this was not a 'we are great' promotional video - there was some brutally honest, biting commentary, and it was refreshing. And you cannot separate the historical events from the evolution of comics, as the former had to influence the latter, or comics would have surely failed long ago. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and will be something I will watch repeatedly - even if it's ultimately just for background noise while I'm working at home.",1311379200,2,1000,4.6875

Long-term fans will be pleased to see appropriate representatives from every significant moment in the company's history in living color, though some of the more embattled personalities such as Alan Moore and Frank Miller only appear via ancient promotional videos. Fresh geeks who don't already know the story will see their horizons broadened by some of the pains and issues DC has confronted and endured over the years, while more seasoned readers will enjoy the refresher course and possibly even learn a thing or two themselves.

4233784,4,B003ZHR6Q6,"These hardcore fans are too self-absorbed. I'm a hardcore fan and I never knew what Irwin Hasen looked like. I never saw any period film clips or photos, like the ones they showed in this doc.

I've heard SOME of these stories before, but not in this detail. Sure, they didn't mention that Dr. Marston, Wonder Woman's creator, was a polyamorist.

And in a way, I don't care if they mentioned the Crisis on Infinite Earths or not. No where else can you find this much information on the history of comic books and in depth interviews with the creators. Finally, a face to go along with the names we read about.

Sure there are fans who go to every comic convention and get autographs, but that's a small number. For even the casual fan, this documentary is required viewing to understand how and why this art form has evolved to a point where guys on the message boards are saying, ""Golden Age Comics are an acquired taste."" Or a movie review that states, ""They actually dumbed DOWN a comic book.""

We've evolved. We can't comprehend comics being just for kids anymore. And it's nice to have documentaries such as these.",1308700800,6,1119,4.552238805970149
4233785,2,B003ZHR6Q6,"As far as DC Comics is concerned right now is a pretty good time for them as they have struck gold with Nowlan's Batman movies and they have that upcoming summer movie with that guy and his lantern. Unfortunately once you start watching this documentary it is painfully obvious that they love the ""Silver Age"" period and damn it you should too!

Getting together a who's who of current and former DC Comics employees you would think that this is going to be a very informative doc but nope as they rush through everything except the origins of DC, Silver Age and the brief time that comics came under attack for corupting the youth. At this point they hit on the usual standard of the birth of the comics code and the troubled times they had after WWII, it is then they're able to get to the #1 subject they wanted to talk about which is the silver age where both Geoff Johns and Dan Didio who are major silver age lovers( if you open a current DC comic today it's painfully obvious ).

Sadly once that's done they makers of this doc pretty much stop caring which is sad because there is a lot of stuff they could have expanded on but chose to gloss over. The biggest of which is DC publishing the Milestone comics, who were not only very successful but also offered the most diverse characters in comics which as one of the creators Dwayne McDuffie pointed out DC themselves have not been able to do without reverting to sterotypes thanks to their silverage regression. It then moves past that to spend time with Jim Lee and his Wildstorm imprint which by that time he sold it to DC was well past it's hayday during it's time with Image then goes on to mention current stuff like Batman Begins and etc.

If you love DC's silver age then this is the dvd for you but there have been other well done comic docs that are way better then this( A&E did a great one ) as in all they give you some parts but keep you in the dark about other things going on",1301875200,2,1949,4.290760869565218

4233789,2,B003ZHR6Q6,"This documentary starts out delightfully, with a cool visual style that takes you into the panels of old books and has insightful interviews regarding not just the origins of DC, but of comics in general.  Adequately narrated by live-action Green Lantern Ryan Reynolds, it follows DC throughout some of the most important events in its history.  But there's a catch -- this isn't necessarily a documentary of the history of DC Comics.  It's more about the social issues of various periods of the 20th century and how the comic book industry responded to them.  After the 1970's, this program abandons all information regarding its main characters and continuity altogether, instead focusing entirely on rebellion (the 1980's), minority writers (the 1990's) and 9/11 (2000's).

The funny thing is that the first half of this documentary is very strong and informative.  But it lost me when they completely ignored the events regarding the early 80's Crisis on Infinite Earths, which is arguably the most important event in the modern continuity of DC Comics.  After the documentary leaves the mid 1970's, the focus is no longer the DC as a continuity-driven comic book publisher.  The 1980's only covers Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen and Sandman.  From here on out it's completely lost its focus and jumps around.  I would watch this to get an understanding of DC's beginnings up until 1980; after that you're not getting the whole story, not even close.

Regarding the DVD release, it's a shame that there are no special features whatsoever.  The recent DC animated releases have been stuffed with featurettes, animated shorts, and a bunch of TV episodes.  This bare bones release is an all around disappointment.  Secret Origin is more likely to be watched by a sociology class than enjoyed by a hardcore fan of DC Comics.",1291420800,24,1823,5.033333333333333
4233790,3,B003ZHR6Q6,I am a 54 year old unrepentant comic book geek. My purchase of Secret Origins was more due to O C D than actual desire. It was DC I had to own it and the fact that Ryan Reynolds ( The New Green Lantern) was the Host/ Narrator sort of clinched it for me. It is a great introduction to the history of DC and comic books in the 20th century and the 21st century transition if you are a novice however the true geek it is  old news as we have heard it all before hundreds of times . Don't get me wrong if you rented it from NETFLIX or caught it on the History Channel it would be a really enjoyable diversion I just not sure the average person would want to own it or ever watch it more than once. But the cover is nice and fits well on my shelve of Comic book DVD'S,1291248000,5,762,3.8227848101265822

8410300,5,B003ZHR6Q6,"Absolutely Love SECRET ORIGIN: THE STORY OF DC COMICS! I've watched it several times over the past few years and am glad to finally have my own copy now, lol. I highly recommend this doc to not only fans of DC but, to fans of comic books in general. Very detailed with great interviews that traces DC from it's beginnings up to 2010 ( one year before DC's relaunch with THE NEW 52). A+",1516233600,,385,4.216216216216216

You would think DC would have got professionals to produce their historic documentary! This could have been so good. I can't believe no other reviewer is bothered by this.",1489968000,,342,5.125
