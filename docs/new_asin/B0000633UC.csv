1686860,1,B0000633UC,"We have really enjoyed the previous 3D animations, but this is pale by comparison.  It's more like Larry Boy meets Dexter's Lab, or a slightly more Vegi ""Powder Puff Girls"".  The message is also weaker, perhaps to appeal to a less Christian audience, but I never found the previous ones too strong in the first place.
The early Vegi-Tales are much better.",1016668800,3,355,4.709677419354839
1686861,5,B0000633UC,"Larry Boy finaaly gets his own series! Working as the janitor at the Daily Bumble *he wasn't qualified for other positions*  where he can keep an eye on the town. Several favorites are back: Bob, the editor in chief, Jr, an reporter, and Larry's faithful butler Archibald. A whole produce truckload of new characters arrive, among them: a new girl cuke reporter, a matronly fungi inventor, and the wise master Bok Choy, who teaches the superhero class at Bumblyber Community College.
The villians this round are Awful Alvin and his sidekick, Lampy. *Lampy is one of my favorite new characters* Alvin's evil plan is to relase angry eyebrows on the city, making the people, er, vegtables hold on to thier anger. Can LarryBoy withstand the attack? Can he defeat Alvin and Lampy? *after the main feature, the short ""Fly by Might"" is shown. Standard Tom & Jerry fare*
In the special DVD features, there are interviews, kareoke, character development,  and other fun diversions.
Mike and Phil have another winner with The Angry Eyeballs. I recomend this for ages 6-126. *Even teens like me love the Cucumber of Steel!*",1016582400,11,1112,4.909574468085107

1686878,5,B0000633UC,"This is a Veggie Tales video that is in a cartoon format instead of the usual computerized animation.  Larry Boy learns the importance of letting go of his anger. He fights against the villan who sends out his evil eyebrow minions to make the residents of Bumblyburg stay mad at each other about silly things.  There is also a bonus cartoon about Larry Boy and an annoying fly that bothers him as he's trying to relax outdoors.  Our kids loved both.  It's next to impossible to find this video at Blockbuster or video stores or dept. stores (I looked and looked), so get it online if you can.",1127001600,,592,4.453703703703703
1686879,5,B0000633UC,"My 3 1/2 year-old loves this video.  We saw it at her Grandfather's house, and this was the only video she watched while she was visiting.  The more I saw it, the more I liked it.  Different from the other VeggieTales videos, but once I got past that and got used to the animation, I realized what a great video it is!  We're definitely buying this one for home.",1110758400,,362,4.202898550724638
1686899,4,B0000633UC,"Sure it's different from other Veggie Tales, but it's technically not Veggie Tales...it's Larry Boy.  It's supposed to be different, and as mentioned, geared for older children.
I do agree that the short was disappointing to say the least...all the fly did was land on his nose, and Larry became obsessed in wishing to destroy him...not a good lesson for kids...
...However, the message of not holding onto one's anger or things will get progressively worse is a very good one, especially if your child has a problem with this.  On a couple occasions after a rough day in school, I'd let my son watch this and the very next day he had totally turned it around, proudly stating that no angry eyebrows got him.
Kudos to Big Idea!",1083888000,3,727,4.627906976744186
1686900,5,B0000633UC,"This Larry Boy cartoon is simply put ""ONE OF THE BES!""  My 2  year old REALLY enjoyed it.  And it kept my 6 year old interest...(he happens to be into super heros!) And my little girl couldn't stop laughing!  Fun for the entire family!",1053561600,,235,4.2727272727272725
1686901,5,B0000633UC,"While I understand what some people are saying about the style, as other reviewers have noted there was a reason for the style change.  Big Idea is trying to go down a path where the videos can be produced more quickly so that kids (parents) have a greater variety of Christian alternatives to choose from.
My 3-year-old son LOVES this video.  He's big into superheros right now, and Larryboy isn't the normal angst-ridden fare with a terrible dark side.  And he has good moral lessons to teach, as well as showing that even if you forget or make a mistake, you can still make it right by listening to God.
My 6-year-old daughter likes it, too.  And how often does that happen?!
Good family fare, unless you don't want your kids to watch the same program 2-4 times in a row.",1049846400,8,774,4.468085106382978

My kids and I love this. It's silly and funny and wholesome. Now, ""Dance with me, Lampy!""",1044835200,3,266,4.804347826086956
1686903,4,B0000633UC,"We are a very ""Veggie"" family, and at first we were also disappointed in this video.  But we have really come to enjoy it and our 2 boys request it more than all of their other veggie videos.
What needs to be understood is that Big Idea is producing these with the specific intention of putting them on regular TV and give Christian families an alternative to Spongbob, Rugrats, etc.  This is a new venue for them, and it is something that we really need to encourage!
We also hope to see new videos comparable to their older 3D ones (or the WONDERFUL Jonah movie) very soon.  Til then, ""what the world needs now is a hero""!!",1037318400,6,625,4.3247863247863245

At least the new theme song rocks.  ""What the world needs now is a hero"" is a great tune.  I agree that the fly cartoon added on is totally unneccessary.",1035331200,,387,4.219178082191781
1686905,2,B0000633UC,My children really love Veggie Tales so when I saw this on DVD I thought they would enjoy it - and they do.  The story line is great and I have no problem with that.  Neither am I bothered by the new cartoon animation instead of the computerized look (although I do prefer the old style).  What bothers me is that I checked the reverse of this DVD to see how long the show would run and it quotes 60 mins.  So I paid a pretty penny to get this on DVD and got home to discover that the cartoon lasts for all of 30 minutes at a push - and that includes the bonus short!  I am not happy about that one bit.  I would not have paid the extra to get this on DVD if I had known it was a mere half an hour.,1034899200,,698,3.7142857142857144
1686906,2,B0000633UC,"Okay, so I've only met Larry Boy twice before.  Still, I know what I saw in the latest 'angry eyebrows' is not the work of a Christian superhero.  In fact, if I didn't know any better, I would not have known that this video was Christian.  There are no scripture references, little reference to God, and worse, there was a lot of inappropriate stuff for children whose innocense should be protected, not deflated.  There were some scary scenes, bad language (I would not allow my children to call others stupid), and like I said, no mention of Jesus and His word.  I don't know what happened when the production of Larry Boy videos was transferred to someone new, but it wasn't good.  I miss the former Larry, the kind cucumber who did what he did because it was right with God.  In other words, I am glad I watched the movie at someone else's house (who also will not be sharing it with their children), and did not waste my money on it.",1026777600,12,938,4.38728323699422
1686907,5,B0000633UC,"I am along with my children a HUGE Veggie tales fan.  Larry Boy has got to be our most favorite character.  I think that the message that this show puts across is one that the children in this day in age need to learn.  With all of the violence and cruelty in the world I think its important to teach our children while they are young to forgive, and not to store up their anger.  My kids have watched this DVD atleast a dozen times.  I totally recommend it to any veggie fan.  Especially those who love Larry Boy!",1025827200,5,514,4.141414141414141

1686919,1,B0000633UC,"it was painful to watch this.  my thoughts were, how did they spend more than a dollar on this ""little"" idea.  i guess when you have the sucess that bid idea has had, it can be easy to lose touch with reality.  this show seemed like nothing more than a poor attempt at ""copying"" other shows and that all too fatal trap of ""brand extension"", which is fine, if the product is good.
I was very disappointed and could not even get one of my veggie lovin' kids to sit through this.  how sad.
a waste of money and time in our families opinion!",1021593600,2,537,4.134615384615385
1686920,1,B0000633UC,"of messing with a good thing?  We love the VeggieTale videos at our house but this is sooo bad.  I don't know who convinced the Big Ideas leadership to experiment with this change but it was a BAD Idea!  The cartoon style looks like a Veggie imitation of the Power Puff Girls and, frankly, the Girls do it better!
There were flashes of the old inspired zaniness during the video but only flashes--such a disappointment.  And no Silly Songs by Larry. (sob!)  Plus the little 'bonus' cartoon at the end with Larry and the pesky fly negated the whole message of letting go of your anger, in my opinion.  It might have made this part better if Larry had found some way to put up with or work with the little fly.
This is just one mistake.  Hope they don't repeat it or that they've killed off their market.  That would be very sad.  But I agree with the others who say don't waste your money.",1020729600,3,888,4.301204819277109
1686921,1,B0000633UC,"I can't begin to explain how much we have loved the Veggie Tales in the past.  We have probably introduced two dozen familes to this once unique, charming, made-for-kids but delightful to adults series.  Now, we are mourning the loss of our Veggie Tales.  We own every single previous Veggie Tale tape, but we won't be buying anymore.  The new animation just looks like yet another Nickelodeon cartoon - gone are the Veggie Tales charm and class.  Where are the Gilbert-and-Sullivan style songs that make the adults at our house voluntarily sit down to watch over and over?  I am really, really bummed - I just can't believe they did this.  Toddlers won't even recognize it as Veggie Tales because the wonderful Bob and Larry opening is no more, and the drawing of the characters barely resembles the old ones.  My little one was asleep when we turned this on - she will not be seeing it - it's in the trash can.  I couldn't even watch the whole thing.  5 thumbs down.",1019779200,3,968,4.543352601156069
1686922,3,B0000633UC,"The faces are different as is the type of animation.  My son, who is a huge Larryboy fan, didn't like the ""new"" Larry.  I also think this video lacks some of the wholesome emphasis of the other Larryboy and Veggie Tales.",1019433600,,220,4.341463414634147
1686923,5,B0000633UC,"... I was struck by the great retro look of the animation and the vibrant and cool color palette.  Wonderful!
Great job Big Idea and Cornerstone Animation!  Great work by two great studios!!  Keep it up...can't wait for the next one!!",1018137600,5,234,4.658536585365853
1686924,3,B0000633UC,"First of all, you should know that this is a cartoon.  They took the characters and changed them from 3D to 2D!  At first, I didn't like it at all, but after watching the whole thing (and all the cool stuff they include in the DVD), I came to appreciate it a bit more.
Yes, it is a shock to those of us who have loved the old Veggie Tales.  They are exploring a new medium and I just hope they aren't abandoning the old one!
The cartoon style is ""retro 60's"" style and you need to think superhero stuff.  Batman, Superman, etc.  The clever lines that they always had which really entertained the adults, are there on this one, but not nearly as many.
I think some young children might be afraid of ""Awful Alvin"", the villian in this new episode. (by the way, Alvin is a scallion, which you will find out if you watch all the extras on the DVD).  His sidekick, Lampy, is not scary at all, and actually doesn't do much, which is entertaining in and of itself.
Welcome a new character ""Bok Choy"" who states his favorite dressing.  He's teaching a class on how to be a superhero.  The subtle humor is there, but you have to listen a little harder for it (or watch it more times <g>).
If you look at this as something different and NOT a new Veggie Tales, I think you will like it better.  Also, if you can, get the DVD version.  I was pleasantly surprised to see all the great extras.  They show you how to draw Larry and Larry-Boy, and there is actually a Bok Choy quiz game, where you actually interact with the DVD!  Oh, and be sure not to miss ""Larry-Oke"", a take off on Karaoke.  They have the picture and the words to the Larry-Boy theme song and the words you're supposed to sing are highlighted.  I can see kids really enjoying singing along.
The DVD has a whole hour of entertainment - the VHS tape has only 30 minutes running time!
Please check out my reviews of Christian books, music, and videos!",1018051200,5,1904,4.252777777777778
1686925,5,B0000633UC,"The first day we got the cartoon, my son watched it twice.  My 14 month old loves veggie tales and I personally like what they teach.  Angry is something that every family has to deal with and this cartoon will make it easier to teach my son how to handle your anger.  I've become a BIG fan of veggie tales - and will continue to purchase there cartoons for my son.",1017878400,6,365,4.112676056338028
1686926,2,B0000633UC,"Many will appreciate the new animation for the VHS, but I personally love the old style.  We own all the videos and know all the Veggie Tale songs.  I personally believe this video is terrible.  My 15 month loves the other videos and always sits still to watch them.  About 15 minutes into this one, he got up and requested to watch a different one.  I consider that significant in itself.  Other than the animation, the story is decent with the usual cast of characters.  I just wish they would not have messed with the animation...it was unique and not a rehash of what has been done before.

1686927,5,B0000633UC,"We so enjoyed the movie and the message - that going to bed angry causes more problems than it is worth!!!  We have watched this for two family nights already - opening up great conversations with our little ones about why we don't hold on to our anger and how it is important to have grace and to forgive others.
We especially hope that this new animation technique will make it possible to have many more Larry Boy adventures - and for them to come out more often!!!  We can't wait for the next one!",1016841600,5,501,4.2631578947368425

7958263,3,B0000633UC,"I hadn't been into VeggieTales too long when they started releasing The Cartoon Adventures of Larry-Boy.  I bought the first one and watching it.  Honestly, Larry-Boy and the Angry Eyebrows didn't impress me that much, and I never watched the other three entries.  I've decided to fix this lack in my VeggieTales experience, so I sat down to watch The Angry Eyebrows again.  It's still not that great.

Larry-Boy finds regular cast member Larry the Cucumber taking on the part of the title superhero.  Larry-Boy is fashioned after Batman, although for this short, he also takes on some characteristics from Superman.  He's working at the Bumblyburg newspaper, but he's working as a janitor since that was the only thing he was qualified to do.  So, basically poor Larry has three identities in these stories.

The story features the return of Awful Alvin, a villain we've never heard of before.  He's determined to exact his revenge of Bumblyburg in particular and Larry-Boy in particular.  And how's he going to do that?  He's invented eyebrows that attach to anyone who is angry and keep them from ever letting go of their anger.  Will his dastardly plan work?  Or will Larry-Boy's superhero classes help him defeat this villain?

The first thing to note is that these are traditional, hand-drawn animation and not the computer animated we normally get from Big Idea.  That change right there is enough to keep some people away.  The voice cast is the same, so once you get used to seeing the characters you know and love with a slightly new look, it's easy to enjoy.

Honestly, my biggest problem with this show is that it feels like we are jumping into something in the middle.  We have no clue who Awful Alvin is or why he feels a need for revenge.  If we did, I have a feeling I would care more about the outcome.  I'm sure they were trying to create an arch-nemesis in the great superhero tradition, but the problem is we need some back ground on them before they become an arch-nemesis.

For the first time in Larry-Boy mythology, they've found something for Bob the Tomato to do, he's the editor of the paper.  And Junior Asparagus is a reporter.  Even though these two characters didn't have much to do, it was fun to see these fan favorites here.

Then there's Bok Choy.  He's the teacher of the superhero class that Larry-Boy is taking.  He's quite obviously supposed to be modeled after Far Eastern gurus.  He's also how they work the Bible verse of the story into the episode, although he quotes form the superhero handbook.  Honestly, I would have liked him and that scene more if he had actually quoted from the Bible.

And there's the narrator.  He's obviously an attempt to provide a classic comic book feel, but he's more of a distraction than a help in getting the story.

Those looking for VeggieTales trademark humor will be satisfied.  I loved Larry-Boy's interaction with a fellow superhero and the way he communicates with his butler Alfred while working at the paper.  The way he gets rid of the eyebrows is also brilliant.

The main story is 22 minutes long.  The rest of the half hour is filled out with ""Fly by Might,"" a short that finds Larry-Boy battling a fly that just won't leave him alone.  It reminds me of a classic Donald Duck short.  Even though there is no moral, state or otherwise, it does reinforce the theme.

Maybe The Cartoon Adventures of Larry-Boy get better as they go along.  The Angry Eyebrows is watchable and has moments of fun.  But ultimately it tries too hard and doesn't live up to its full potential.",1432080000,,3558,4.655948553054662
