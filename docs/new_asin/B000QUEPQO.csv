8197459,1,B000QUEPQO,I can see why no one heard about this film. It sounded great but it was not.,1253404800,,76,3.5294117647058822
8197460,4,B000QUEPQO,"Your heart only goes out to the little girl whose mother abandoned her and whose father never owned up to his responsibility. I would rate it five stars if the suspense was tighter, but give it four for a good plot. There could have been a little more emotion as well. I'm sure that Paige Hurd could have pulled off some tears. But then again, what would one expect from a survivor-type juvenile but to be tough.

Good recommendation if you're looking for a little drama and suspense but it's no ""Lean On Me"" drama.",1207872000,2,515,4.421052631578948
