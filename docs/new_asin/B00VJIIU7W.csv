8710322,5,B00VJIIU7W,"This is in 2D which is awesome, a big step up from other shows based on Movies like Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon which look like cheaper versions of the movies. Great they didn't make that mistake with this one, the look is awesome. Also I laughed a lot while watching this, it must be one of the funniest things out there as well as being one of the best shows I've ever seen. The characters are great, this is a real treat.",1438041600,,439,4.057471264367816
