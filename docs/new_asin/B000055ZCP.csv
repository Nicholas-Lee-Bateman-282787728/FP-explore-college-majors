7931285,4,B000055ZCP,"The movie is a typical french romantic comedy and this is rather a complement. As usual in such films you can expect deep pchylogical observations, in this case of quite unstable single woman in her thirties (played fabulously by Karin Viard). There is plenty of humor and even sarcasm in the movie. I was rather a little disappointed by the ending (contrary to what some other viewers said here) since I felt that it somehow didn't follow the spirit of the movie - therefore only four stars. But overall, if you like romantic comedies and/or like french movies you will not be disappointed.",1083024000,2,591,4.747572815533981
