8698888,4,B00SM43AFS,"This disc is a re-issue of a disc previously titled `Entre quatre-z-yeaux' which split opinion in terms of reviews being awarded 5 and 1 star grades. The original recording was made in 1999 with the bonus concert items being recorded in 2000. The producer was Paul Smaczny who has made many fine recording for Euroarts before forming his own company `Accentus.' (This review was written after considering the Blu-ray option and using the earlier UK release of the multi-region disc).

The confusion over responses may well be the result of a misunderstanding concerning the real purpose of this disc and which is implied by the original title and, perhaps unfortunately, not kept for this reissue. Collectors may be tempted to purchase this disc as a performance of the Preludes book 1 with some documentary elements or alternatively they may consider this as primarily a documentary about Debussy using the Preludes as illustrative material. This distinction will make a huge difference to the way the disc is appreciated.

There is no doubt that the prime purpose of the disc is to explore Debussy as a character and as a musician with the intention to try and explain his whole approach to conceiving composition. Each Prelude is played subsequent to some such observation and is intended to be the precise example of the point being made.

Essentially Barenboim is at pains to make the point that Debussy's music is the art of illusion, one of seeing things at a distance and just out of immediate reach. Throughout this documentary it is made clear that Debussy was a complex character who was essentially a very private individual who enjoyed limited company but rarely allowed himself to be drawn into close contact. He was volatile capable of `violent' outbursts which quickly dissipated. He was seen to have a certain charm in company.

Debussy was passionate about his music but had no desire to be a leader of a `school' of composition. Above all he related to sounds and experiences of nature which he considered was a form of constant music from which he drew his inspiration. He also was deeply interested in literature and especially in poetry and this also was a source of inspiration. Finally, he was an apparent contradiction of impressionism coupled with absolute precision of execution.

Apart from the performances of the Preludes, there are copious examples taken from poetry that inspired Debussy as well as his own descriptions of natural forms of inspiration. There are spoken quotations from other musicians and close associates and these can also be followed on subtitles in English, French and Spanish. There is some use made of a solitary dancer and some scenarios which showed characters in situations such as a library or playing chess but all portrayed as if dissociated from anyone else. The two chess players simply do not interact and the implication is that this is a reflection of Debussy's own solitary behaviour as described by those who knew him and shared his company, withdrawn though it might be for much of the time. Perhaps the suggestion is that Debussy was more of an observer than a participant.

The setting for the Preludes is that of a beautifully lit room with diffused natural lighting. Indeed, for much of the film there is much use made of diffused lighting and the effect is satisfyingly attractive. It also seems very appropriate. The camera work and imaging is typical of the sensitive work of Paul Smaczny and, as he had started using HD cameras at about that time it seems likely that this is a genuine HD product. The piano sound is presented in realistic and full range stereo.

Barenboim himself plays the Preludes very well as would be expected but it would be wrong to suggest that this is a match for others such as the award winning Jean-Efflam Bavouzet or the very different and volatile Krystian Zimerman. Other Debussy pianists of distinction must include Michelangeli as well as those from earlier generations. All of those offer a greater range of subtle insights but they do not come with the documentary insights offered here.

Having watched this disc several times I would suggest that it is full of interest and is a rewarding disc, even upon close repetition. Its real value lies in the documentary aspects which are the prime purpose and in that context the musical performances are completely satisfactory.

The bonus material consists of 18 minutes of encore pieces recorded at a concert which Barenboim gave in Buenos Aires before a home crowd in 2000. He is very much on top form and delights the packed audience with a Chopin selection plus some Schumann. The recording is good sonically and visually and rounds off a very attractive disc in a very rewarding manner.

It is a shame that the opportunity to hear the complete performances of the preludes without the documentary was not offered as a bonus feature, especially as they must have been recorded separately. Being able to hear/watch the preludes as a set without the documentary would have enhanced the appeal of this set considerably for most purchasers.

Overall however, this disc offers purchasers a rewarding documentary which easily bears repeated viewing and offers good performances even if they cannot be viewed separately.",1427760000,3,5276,4.963759909399774
