950603,2,6305017271,"This movie was ""alright"". The action was top-notch and building an entire city set and then submerging it under water is impressive, BUT the movie simply had NO story-line what-so-ever. No character development  at all. The moive goes a little like this: Here are the characters, this is  what they're gonna do, now enjoy. The only reason I gave 2 stars is for the  action and I have a thing about rain. Don't ask.  ;-)",912902400,2,419,4.546666666666667

But this is a very good flick from back in the day!  Gotta love Morgan Freeman.  What movie isn't good with him in it.?  This thing is action packed and twisty in plot--so much of it--85% easy is filmed with everybody floating in water up to their necks.  Hard Rain and the dam broke....but the plot is about stealing  $3 million dollars from rom an armored car.  Realistic?  Probably not--but stranger things have happened.  No, not academy award.  No big deep thinking revelations of soul searching.  It was just fun to watch.  I like kick-butt action movies.  This was one.  I really enjoyed this movie!  This is the only movie I ever saw Minnie Driver in.  She was enjoyable, too.  Randy Quaid is well, Randy Quaid. I don't know why it didn't get a higher rating.  It was a lot better than so that were made at the same time--and much better than some made today. Good for a rainy Saturday afternoon entertainment.",1483574400,4,1053,4.4188481675392675

Stellar cast is wasted in this poorly written bank heist/disaster movie. The screenplay suffers from identity crisis.
It is like a committee tried to write the screenplay and shove every single trope into one movie.
There was no clear POV main character either,.  We keep slipping from the POV of the sheriff to the security guard to the head bank robber to the church restorer. Please just pick a hero/heroine and stick with that person's POV throughout the movie so we can care about someone!",1475366400,3,610,4.700934579439252

Add type-cast Randy Quaid, Ed Asner, and Betty White, and Minnie Driver as the last girl in an evacuated town, and you have way too many scene-stealers battling over a clutch of poorly lit flood scenes. That said, the same ensemble in a high desert at noon facing a brush fire probably wouldn't have worked any better.

This story would have worked better as a straight drama, with a cast of unknowns and fewer gags and camera gimmicks. Not awful, if you're watching it on Prime, but not worth paying for the privilege.",1425081600,3,628,4.557522123893805

955884,2,6305017271,"It is rare for me not to finish a movie, even if it is bad. This is one of those exceptions. It was so hard to watch, the plot is convoluted and absurd.

The character develop seemed incredibly poorly done, the story is rather absurd, and I just think the plot is completely unbelievable. The characters are not relatable as people, nor do they have any redeeming, human-like qualities to make any audience care about them or their decisions. In the movie, the (attempted) heist is unbelievable, and horrifically planned, and just completely ridiculous to consider.

It tries to tackle several different conflicts: stolen/missing money, death, corrupt public officials, meaning and order for one's life, and it includes a cheap attempt at romance involving Minnie Driver and an old church for some odd reason, which is never really in line with the story, at least as far as I could tell as I could only handle this movie in small increments.
It tries to hard to make twists to keep its audience engaged, and surprised, but they are cheap twists, not hinted or foreshadowed well at all.

Even Morgan Freeman, being Morgan Freeman and the greatest part of this movie and the only one who seemed to care about actually acting and being a real character, could not salvage the train-wreck of incoherent absurdity which comprises this film.

Perhaps there is more symbolism hidden with the movie than I give it credit for, but the convoluted plot and absurdity of the story itself continue to muddle any kind of coherence which was present.",1424390400,2,1536,4.828897338403042

Then it got a little silly with each side taking the advantage from the other side several times.  There's one scene where a guy gets hammered in the head by a flying boat motor and he still came back out of the water for another turn.  Another thing silly is, two guys get pinned down with two side arms between them.  It was like the old westerns where the shooters have guns that never run out of bullets.  SPOILER:  Also, soon as I saw Randy Quad at the beginning as Sheriff, I knew he was going to turn bad.

I really want to give it a two, but It kept me watching, so I'll generously give it a three.",1423094400,2,749,4.089041095890411

There's skullduggery off every port, most of the people left in town are crooks.  And why not, with 3 million up for grabs.  What this movie lacks in story it more than makes up for with the casting of Morgan Freeman (he automatically adds class to any project).  The rest of the actors do their job.

Picture Quality: 4/5

The water and such looks detailed in my opinion. It could probably not look a lot better than it does on this BD version. This BD looked better than the standard definition on i saw on tv, several years ago. I was happy with the quality.

Audio Quality: 4.5/5

I didn`t except the audio track on this film to be so good, so i was pleasantly suprised by it. The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 was played very good on my 5.1 system. The subwoofer channel is often used to good effect in my opinion.

Like for example in: very good bass from the weapons, explosions and those powerfull water waves. The dialog coming from the Center speaker sounds clear and fine. The Rear speakers are used in: the shootouts, music and water dripping and such.

So, their truck is loaded with about three million Dollars. Hank tries to prevent further flooding, as he's the guy responsible for the dam up the river, but he has to open one gate in order to save the old dam from breaking. Only the police under the Sheriff's leadership stay in town to prevent looting. As the water level rises, Tom and Charlie's Truck gets stuck in the flooded road. This is the moment, Jim, an elderly thief, and his gang have been waiting for. In an attempt to get the money from the truck, Charlie gets shot and Tom swims off to save the cash bags. While trying to hide, he meets Karen, who resisted to leave the old church she has been restoring for eight months. She thinks he is a looter, and calls the cops to bring him in. But as the Sheriff finds out about that much cash in a situation like this, he radios his old pal Hank, up at the dam. This is a highly recommended movie.

The large and varied cast, do and say a lot of things that are entertaining and less deep than the flood level. Still; it's more fun than a barrel of sea monkeys.

Mainly because he's kind of like an everyman, regular guy like Bruce Willis' character in ""Die Hard"" (ironic that Hard is in both titles), who's forced into incredible situations. He does the best he can using his wits and cunning along with above average physical strength,without having or using the advantages of huge, bulging biceps and pecs like Arnold or Sly's characters seem to have in equally similar movies.  Minnie Driver is at her most beautiful in this one!!  If you fell in love with her intelligence, combined with the refined beauty she displayed in ""Good Will Hunting"", then this is the movie for you!!  You should rent it just to see her at her peak of perfection!  Her relationship to Christian Slater is very believable and they play off of one another very well.  Randy Quaid is a believable sheriff and Morgan Freeman is a decent bad guy but, it's the constant threat of rain and the Dam breaking that gives the movie its constant tension.  The action is extremely good and it's just an all-around good flick to watch on a Friday or Saturday night!  Highly recommended!!!",1146355200,4,1229,4.732394366197183

957129,2,6305017271,"I saw this at Blockbuster for rent and saw Morgan Freeman's name on it so I decided to rent it. I thought it was going to be a solid thriller but boy was I wrong.

This movie is an action movie, and one really unrealistic movie. Morgan Freeman is great as usual and there is some fun. But, the movie is predictable, unrealistic, dumb and has bad acting. Christian Slater's acting was horrible and Morgan Freeman can't save the movie. The plot is neat, in which an armored truck transports a lot of money in a huge flood. But, some crooks hold it up to steal the money. The problem is that the officer in the truck won't let them off so easy and tries to bring the money to where it's supposed to go.

I had the movie predicted 10 minutes into it and the movie had no suspense or anything. All it was, was Christian Slater beating everyone up. It had some good chases but besides that and some ok action, it was a bad movie.

It's not even worth renting because of its terrible acting, predictability, and basically everything about it.

Morgan Freeman is good but this movie degrades him. This movie is mindless junk but not good mindless junk. Commando is good mindless junk but this isn't. Forget this movie and just act like it doesn't even exist. This movie isn't interesting at all and I recommend never watching it.",1123804800,2,1321,4.401639344262295
957130,4,6305017271,"Yup - the plot does stretch your ability to suspend disbelief, but it stops short of actually asking you to hang it by the neck until it's dead - the story is unlikely, but there are no obvious plot holes to disrupt the fun.

Morgan Freeman dishes up his usual excellence in this role - a crook looking for a retirement fund, with a typical crew to help - a screwup 20s rowdy, an unemployed high school science teacher, and a scripture-quoting pro.

Christian Slater is, well, Christian Slater - I've been a fan for years, and this is yet another appearance of the wisecracking, intrepid guy that Mr. Slater plays so often.  It'd get repititious if it weren't so much fun.  He's at the end of a ""clean out the banks before they're flooded"" run, with $3 million in the truck when it's stuck in a deep spot in the ever-present water.

Minnie Driver does a fine, if understated, job as the woman who stayed in town too long, preparing a church she's been restoring to weather the flood, who gets involved in the scramble for the cash.  While she's on the side of the good guys, there's no real steam between her and Slater.

Randy Quaid is the Sheriff who recently lost his re-election, and is bitter and angry, but determined to do a good job as long as he's on the clock - until the temptation of that money proves to be too much for him.

For a film set almost entirely in a nighttime rain, the camerawork is amazingly good.  The effects work nicely, the flood gives us an element that's unusual in action films, and the cast works well together, even when the script gets a tad overblown.

The widescreen DVD has a few basic features, but is pretty scant in extras - no deleted scenes, no trailers for other movies, nothing you'd not have seen in the theatre but the trailer for this film - which was a disappointment, but not fatal.

All in all, a fun 96 minutes of video, if you're not in the mood for something deep and meaningful.",1116547200,15,1935,4.377094972067039

This is standard D grade hollywood action fare,about as contrived and stupid as it gets. The acting isn't really an issue,here,it's the braindead plot and script,which frequently makes no sense. The special effects aren't really impressive,either,since much of the film looks as if it was filmed in a bathtub.

By the way,it seems in vogue amongst Amazon browsers to excuse and apologize for any mediocre and brainless flick by stating 'lighten up,it's an action movie!',or 'it's a comedy!'. I suppose any dreck ever vomited upon the landscape can be immune to criticism under these terms.

While bashing, they throw comments in to make sure you know that THEY know all the in's and out's of movie making, actors, directors, plots.. blah blah blah.

This movie is an action flick.

It's funny how so many say how ""unbelievable"" it is, as if somewhere out there, there are 3 million dollar bank heists every day with subplots, strong dialog and explosions all around.

Action flicks are just that, action flicks.

It's like they are reading the script as they go and even the actors must think it's stupid, because they don't seem like they care. As I watched, I guessed that someone in Hollywood heard about a town that would be completely flooded, so they went there and made a movie without any time to write a story. It feels like they sat around for 20 minutes, thought of something to do for the next scene and shot it with one take. Really embarrassing for such well-known actors. What were they thinking!?

957135,4,6305017271,"HARD RAIN is enough to make you never want to see it rain again.  Filmed entirely during the horrific storm and with the threatening collapse of the local dam, this movie requires some squinting of the eyes just to tell who's who.  Director Mikael Solomon keeps things moving, and if the whole plot wasn't so darn preposterous and absurd, this could have been a classic.  There are some great chase scenes, double crosses, etc., etc.  It's just not very believable.

Christian Slater's laconic performance is reminiscent of a young Jack Nicholson, but he seems awkward and clumsy as an action hero (ditto BROKEN ARROW), but he's pleasant.  Morgan Freeman reprises his bad guy role from CHAIN REACTION and the future NURSE BETTY with his usual grace and precision.  Morgan's probably never given a bad performance.  Randy Quaid is grim and vile as the sheriff gone bad, and Betty White/Richard Dysart provide some fun comic relief as an elderly couple who refuse to leave town.  (Wonder what happens to them though---last we see them they're stuck in a tree?).

HARD RAIN may have benefitted from a more believable lead, say Bruce Willis, but it's entertaining and delivers, in spite of its silliness.",1090972800,14,1200,4.925373134328358
957136,4,6305017271,"It was constantly suggested that I watch this film during the daytime. Not a chance. It's just not one of those films! It's filmed in one night (the daytime scenes were cut out), and a lot of the time, you can barely see the characters, due to the darkness of the picture. Normally, I would find that extremely annoying, but for this film, it actually works. So I was very happy when this was put in the DVD player, and it was dark! (And I discovered I can take a reasonable picture on my digital camera in the darkness without someone realising until the flash goes!) Written by the same guy who wrote Speed, Graham Yost (yes, I do shock people when I come out with these interesting little facts - it's only my favourite film!), you know it's gonna be good.

I think soon enough I'm definitely going to be in a full blown Christian Slater mood, as I'm going to see him in a play of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest! (He'll be so good as McMurphy) So this'll mean endless re-runs of Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves - I really should get Heathers on DVD.

Despite the fact that he's losing his hair at the same rate as Jack Nicholson, he's extremely cute, and he definitely looked a bit of alright in this - was it the uniform that did it for? Or the Bruce Willis-esque white T-shirt?! Nice! And his nice short hair too - don't get me wrong, I like him with the floppy hair he sports in Robin Hood/Heathers, but the shorter the better.

Sometimes the characters are very confusing, especially as certain characters constantly switch sides, so you never know who's a goodie, and who's a baddie. But the way Christian & Morgan Freeman's characters eventually end up coming together against an evil, corrupted sherriff (played by Randy Quaid).

With all the water, you're instantly reminded of Titanic, and some scenes are extremely similar, although it's not possible, as both films were filmed/released at different times, so just coincidence. Minnie Driver (no doubt following up Kate Winslet's comments) has said she hated filming in all the water, probably for days at a time, and who can blame her? Coming from a non-swimmer (I know it's as easy as riding a bike - oh wait...), this film was sometimes a scary prospect for me to watch, as I put myself in the characters positions, and figured I probably would have freaked out in their (albeit, sometimes unreal) positions.

Some of the comic relief (yes there is some) is provided by the nervous old man and his wife, culminating in a hilarious situation in a boat.

This is definitely a great film, to watch Christian Slater get wet & wild. And Morgan Freeman plays the same kinda character that he plays in Chain Reaction - you keep waiting for him to pull out the big fat cigar. Highly recommended. So glad I watched this.

Aside from that, it is a WET movie with a lot of HARD RAIN!!!!!!",1014508800,5,758,4.580882352941177
957203,5,6305017271,"This movie is a flop in its theatrical run. So the DVD is its best chance to appreciate the movie. It is a great action thriller about a bunch of robbers headed by Morgan Freeman who attempt to rob an armor car driven by Christian Slater during a big flood in a small town. The director, Mikael Solomon is the underwater photographer from ""The Abyss"" so he handles wet scenes really well and 99% of the movie takes place in a rain. Randy Quaid and Minnie Diver co-star. The picture of the DVD is sharp and bright and the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is very good. Action fans get this DVD, you won't be sorry.",989625600,3,604,4.260869565217392
957204,4,6305017271,"first i want to start off by saying that i love christian slater and i thought this was a great movie...however, there were a few things that i thought were kinda lame, mostly some of the lines...like when the sheriff (i am at a loss for his name at the moment, Randy Quaid's character) says something about eating ... for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and then says that from now on everything will be ... free, that was pretty lame...it sounded like something that sounded good at three in the morning when everyone was getting a little giddy around the table and everything that was said either sounded good or to hilarious to pass up, ya know? also, something else that has been bothering me...when the one guy quotes a song...""at night we go down to the river and into the river we dive""? remember that? well, that song was not sung by springsteen (i don't think i spelled his name right, forgive me), it was sung by billy joel, trust me, my friend used to have a thing for billy joel and i had to listen to it day and night! lol...anyway, thats just my opinion, i think people should make own opinion about everything, so see ""hard rain"" and make up your own mind, i thought it was great, you may not, but it may turn out to be your favorite movie, you never know where it may take you! thanks for your time. :o)",989366400,,1317,4.336032388663968
957205,5,6305017271,"Shot as 'The Flood' in 1996, re-shot as 'Hard Rain' in 1997, and released into cinemas with virtually no publicity in 1998 it's a shame that this film sank with out a trace (pun intended). But you have to wonder why the studio abandoned it when it took investment from multiple backers to keep the production afloat (pun intended again).

I recall seeing publicity shots in 1997 for scenes (and characters) that aren't even in the movie. I guess we'll never know what Graham Yost's script was originally about. Paramount figured that the public had had enough of disaster movies and re-tooled 'The Flood' as a heist flick midway through filming. I can't say if it's for better or worse, but Hard Rain is still an exciting action ride.

Yes, the characterization is thin, but it avoids the cliche of making them all annoying as a quick way of defining them (something Twister, Volcano, and Dante's Peak were guilty of). The stragglers caught in the deluge as Huntingburg, Indiana is swept off the face of the Earth don't need to define themselves. They are who they are. Since the movie virtually takes place in real time there's little room for meaningless development.

Minnie Driver's unconvincing accent aside, the cast do pretty well with the material, and Slater makes for a better action hero here than he did in Broken Arrow (ironically, by the same writer).

Hard Rain works best in the cinema. It's too bad that it flopped because the big screen is where it deserved to be seen. Too many folks have seen and criticized this film from TV viewings that do the scope of the action no justice whatsoever. The water and chaos is very well shot and brilliantly staged. The bouncing, shaking, wobbling camera was an innovative idea, and if you like the slow-motion fire-fights of John Woo movies then you'll get a kick out of Hard Rain.

Another strong aspect that has gone overlooked with the rest of the movie is Chris Young's powerful score; the orchestral sound of violence, mayhem, and nature taking over. Seriously, it's great stuff and you really ought to get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Rain-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B0000015NZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Rain: Music From The Motion Picture</a>.

Despite the bad reviews and poor box office returns Hard Rain is still a highly entertaining B-movie. We'll never know the full story behind its trouble production (there hasn't been anything close to a Special Edition DVD, and Mikael Salomon has never spoken publicly about it), but I recommend it to all action movie junkies.

This movie is great , it is not hyped and doesn't have the big names ""stars"" but the action is very good , the cinematics is stunning buteifull and the plot and use of the flood motive to create an intersting enviorment for the story to take place  is good enough.

957207,1,6305017271,"There's action, water (plenty of water), gun play, more action, actors from the ""A"" list (Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver), one from the ""B"" list (Randy Quaid) and the ""star"" of it all, Christian Slater; ""It"" being none other than ""Hard Rain,"" an ""action/thriller"" written by Graham Yost and directed by Mikael Salomon.  Going in, it would seem that it has all the elements required of a film of this genre to succeed.  Going out, one must pause to reflect and wonder:  How did this movie ever see the light of day?  How did it even get made?  Better yet, why?  For anyone unlucky enough to have suffered through this muddle in a theater, the only ""thrill"" would've been finally being able to leave when it was over.  One of the blessings of video is that it adds to one's options; in this case, being able to TURN IT OFF and cut your losses.  The trouble begins with the screenplay by Yost (who as a writer is responsible for a number of decent, exciting movies, including ""Speed, ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Mission To Mars""), whose concept here is suspect from the start.  In the middle of a flood, which quickly renders everyone practically immobile (almost immediately every character is up to their waist in water), four men planning to rob an armored car continue on as if their feet are still on dry ground; and it's only the beginning of a plot that stretches credibility just too far.  As it plods along (I should say ""slogs"" along), even suspending disbelief will not work here; sure, this is an action flick and you have to accept what you're given to a certain extent.  But here we're to believe, for instance,  that no less than six lifelong law-abiding, decent citizens suddenly become murderers and thieves, two with some premeditation, four at the drop of a hat.  It just doesn't wash, by anyone's measuring stick.  Soon frames of reference begin to cloud and merge, which creates an even more ambiguous reality; halfway through this movie you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys without a scorecard.  And, as if to make sure that none of this can be taken with even a grain of salt, the dialogue is so bad it must be the stuff of which an actor's worst nightmares are born.  Better they should have no lines to say than be saddled with this inane prattle.  At least when the story picks up the town has already been evacuated, except for the Sheriff and three or four officers and a utility worker, and of course the obligatory (in this case three) others who refuse to leave.  This is a positive note, however.  Fewer characters means fewer occasions for banal utterances.  The crushing blow is delivered, however, by director Salomon, whose lack of imagination renders this film D.O.A.  And he should have seen it coming; it's his job to know what works and what doesn't.  He's the one with the placard that says ""The Buck Stops Here.""  The real shame of this debacle, though, is the waste of such talent as Freeman and Driver, especially, and even Quaid and Slater.  They deserve better.  To their credit, they all did as much as was humanly possible with the material with which they were given to work.  This is one of those projects that must have looked good on paper, but somewhere in the execution went south.  And apparently very quickly.  The supporting cast includes Edward Asner (Uncle Charlie), Michael A. Goorjian (Kenny), Richard A. Dysart (Henry), Betty White (Doreen) and Mark Rolston (Wayne).  On the positive side, ""Hard Rain"" does have some decent special F/X.  But the best thing about this movie is the fact that it makes one appreciate a really good film, the kind we've come to expect from the people involved with this one.  It makes you appreciate Schwarzenegger.  It even makes you appreciate Van Damme.  Then again, this isn't the first time that actors of this caliber have been entangled with a movie this bad.  In fact, if you listen closely you can almost hear Michael Caine off somewhere chuckling and whispering ""Jaws 4"" to himself in a quiet aside.",975974400,,3999,4.6576319543509275

957287,5,6305017271,"This movie was shot during heavy rain, floods and in a town with 57 buildings (some 6 stories tall). The amazing thing about this movie is the fact that it was shot ""indoors"". Nobody who sees this movie will  believe it was an indoor set. The set was the Boeing aircraft hanger which  had earlier been used to assemble the B-1B bomber in Palmdale California.  This makes the set and visual effects beyond belief. At the time, it was  the largest indoor movie set in history (might still be). The back drop  (the painted mural used as the background) and the size of of water tank  were also the largest in the world. The back drop was 72 feet tall and 1960  feet long, making it the largest mural painted in history. The water tank  was 600 feet long and 250 feet wide and held 5 million gallons of water. I  was involved in renting this building to Paramount studios and still can't  believe what they were able to do in our aircraft hanger.

The film isn't quite as  good as the disc and only gets three and a half stars but is still a worthy  effort.  Its a good idea which just lacks a certain edge to it. However,  there's more than enough action and dialogue to keep you entertained and  the effects are also outstanding.  The cast is pretty good and Christian  Slater gives a good performance as does the unfathomable Morgan Freeman of  course.  Plus good ol' Betty White (Golden Girls, Lake Placid) plays her  accustomed lovable, eccentric granny role with her usual adeptness,  providing some humour to the movie.

7880969,4,6305017271,"The sheer number of negative reviews of Hard Rain is an utter enigma. I've seen thousands of films, and own hundreds, and have a better than average comprehension of the cinematic arts than your average consumer, and I simply cannot find whatever it is that triggers the peculiar neurological anomaly in viewers who complain that Hard Rain is ""boring,"" or it's plot ""convoluted."" While the cast does barely manage to land just below the maximum level that a simple heist picture can bear, before the audience begins to lose track of who is who, it's a credit to the director that none of the characters becomes anonymous in the dark and the deluge.

HR is a taught and relentlessly paced action film that hits the ground running the instant the opening credits fade from the screen, and barely pauses to let you catch your breath before the final credits begin to roll. If you have time to get bored, there's something seriously amiss, see a doctor immediately. While there may not be any spectacular stunts that you've never seen anywhere before, the stunts abound, and the chase is nonstop - as is the torrential downpour and the rising flood - this story is so dark and so wet, you may feel the need to towel off several times before it's over. Of course there are implausible escapes, you can't have an action movie without impossible hair-breadth narrow misses every few minutes, and cynical characters double-crossing each other, and guns that never empty - until it's convenient for the script writer (the same mind who brought you 'Speed' and 'Broken Arrow,' no less, also top notch breathless actioners).

What you won't find, are long monologues, existential angst, or nuanced character development. These people are pretty much what they appear to be the first time they're seen onscreen. They don't grow, or wisen, or mellow with time. They chase and try to kill each other. There are a handful of decent human beings, a whole bunch of greedy A-holes, and some old folks for comedy relief, and it's not hard to tell who's who. But if Hard Rain doesn't keep you glued to the screen from beginning to end, adjust your meds and watch it again. It's not the movie, it's you.",1524355200,,2182,4.739473684210527
