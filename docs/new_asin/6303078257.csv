Is it campy? Yes. Are there mistakes? Just ask the character whose name is either Tommy or Tony (or both!?). But is it worth watching? Oh yes! Like reviewer Andy Stegall, watching this movie with a beer and a friend is a good way to go. There are so many quotable lines, you and said friend will have a treasure trove of inside jokes to share for years to come.

You may recognize the leading lady from Better Off Dead. You'll enjoy serveral cameos from desert racing's greats and some engine-revving real race footage. The disjointed, unrealistic plot is matched only by the flip-flopping between seriousness (like a memory lane excusion into a broken childhood) and hilarity (finding your kidnapped BFF alive... which somehow puts Our Hero in stitches).

This movie is an absolute must-have for any racing fan's collection, right up on the shelf next to Driven and Days of Thunder.",1449446400,,909,4.777070063694268
7837168,1,6303078257,"I caught this on some public access channel not too long ago while staying up with my buddy drinking beer. We had some laughs making fun of it, but it was hard sitting through most of the film resisting the urge to shoot myself with the gun I keep close by for just such an occasion.

I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was called until I came across it on Amazon by pure happenstance.

Let's start with the title. Desert Steel. It tells you all you need to know about the film. It takes place in a desert, and there are lots of cars made of steel. The producer didn't get very imaginative with the title, you dig? Desert Steel seems to promise you lots of action and excitement, but at the same time, the blandness of the cast and the title tells you you're in for one boring-ass ride.

The main protagonist, because he sure ain't no hero, is the guy from An American Werewolf in London. Here, he looks like Stanley Tucci playing Jerry Seinfeld. Basically, he's an unlikeable, egomaniac douchebag who's the hottest racer with some desert racing crew that you're supposed to give a damn about but just can't. There there's some B.S subplot with the Mafia that doesn't go anywhere, and he has to learn how to be a better person, and somehow racing in the desert is supposed to do just that. Long story short, good luck investing yourself in the plot.

I swear they used Sega Genesis chip-tunes for the soundtrack 25 years before doing that was cool. My buddy and I got so drunk that a lot of the details blurred together before movie's end that I can't remember much else about the film. Do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague, unless bad movies are your thing, in which case, this film is definitely MST3k worthy.",1394668800,,1735,4.395638629283489
