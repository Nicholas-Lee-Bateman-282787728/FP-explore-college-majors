8684294,2,B00OMCLIFS,"Can't believe I am giving a Peter Cushing movie a low rating, but his brief contribution could not save this movie. Is so cheesy and full - could have been better. Tedious to watch. But others may like it.",1515024000,,205,4.282051282051282
8684295,4,B00OMCLIFS,Great suspenseful movie that keeps you on the edge!,1485043200,,51,4.777777777777778
8684296,4,B00OMCLIFS,A must for the classic Hammer lover!  Peter Cushing is all that one might expect him to be and the ending is classic Hammer-twisted!,1436054400,,132,4.5
8684297,2,B00OMCLIFS,"ok, but video was grainy NOT what I consider a remastered DVD.

No subtitle.

No extras.

The story wasn't that good so can't recommend a buy unless you're collecting Peter Cushing movies.",1421798400,,188,4.8125
