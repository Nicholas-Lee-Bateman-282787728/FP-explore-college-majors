8110433,1,B000EIBC7I,"The DVD set was bad. It had defective DVDs. Some of the DVDs were sticking to the plastic cover and hence the DVDs were damaged. It was manufactured In Canada in 2000, so it's old for 2015! Iwill not buy anything from this market place provider.",1427846400,,245,4.3478260869565215

8110435,5,B000EIBC7I,This movie is wonderfully inspiring. Well done and the acting by the key characters is very moving. I learned a great deal since the perspective of the producer is very advanced spiritually. The portrayal of Lord Ram is far superior on key issues than others I have purchased and watched. Ramayan by Chopra had defective disks in the series and in this one all the disks work perfectly. The Chopra production also left me actually disliking Ram in his attitude toward Sita so watching this version was healing since in this version Ram is lovable and loving. I highly recommend this to all sincere truth seekers.,1366761600,2,612,4.783018867924528
8110436,5,B000EIBC7I,This DVD is a follow up of the Ramayan DVD and in my opinion is the correct ending for this great story. Thank you for helping me to get it. The DVD was received in good condition.,1340582400,2,180,3.891891891891892
