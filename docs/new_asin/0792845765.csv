Actualy ROBOCOP is original prints is 1.66 as shown on the CRITERION Edition,The original Aspect Ratio. It Contains Chapter Search and Animated Menus, and noting more. NO TRAILERS,Image gallery nore a Making Of. Even the Criterion doesent. But I know this Box set is a Collectors Item since ORION is now called MGM.And they should make a Special EDITION box set because ROBOCOP does have deleted scenes and I know that personally. Also ROBOCOP need to be presented in a 5.1 EX surround instead of STEREO Suround,ED-209's ""Whump"" has no bass.

157594,5,0792845765,"A great example of how a sequel can taint the film it sequelises, this un-necessary collection combines one of the finest science fiction films of the 1980's with two increasingly bad sequels. 'Robocop' is fantastic - a  satirical view of corruption and crime in a near-future Detroit. The  effects are fantastic, despite the modest budget, and only the OCP  video-wall has dated. Remove the robots and the setting, of a commercial  city on the edge of mania, seems edgily real. The violence is both shocking  and funny, and Verhoven's sardonic black humour was sorely missed from the  sequels.
The first sequel, release at the same time as a host of other  sequels ('Die Hard 2' being the obvious competition), was like an  averaged-out, cruder version of the original. The news snippets are more  obviously parodic, the violence is nastier and unfunny, and the whole film  is just a bludgeoning mess. As Empire magazine said, 'if you like to  stagger from a film feeling numb and slightly sick, this is the film for  you'.
As for the third, Peter Weller-less film, don't go there. Really.  It's bad. No. Look away. Imagine the disappointment you felt on watching  'Alien 3', magnified a million-fold.",959731200,7,1202,4.91542288557214

Packaging is nice. Robocop 1 is great and has amazing extras on the disc, however 2 & 3 are barebones and I know there has to be footage somewhere or even interviews they could have done to flesh them out. Although for $14 I paid for a three Blu Ray box set it's hard to complain. Just extras would have been nice.",1484697600,3,471,3.90625

157616,4,0792845765,"I have already reviewed the individual films on this three-disc set.  This review is specifically about this trilogy of RoboCop films on Blu-Ray DVD's.

I appreciate the packaging of these three discs, in a single, rubbery, blue plastic case, typical of Blu-Rays.  This case has a page of the same material, providing easy access to each of the three discs - one inside the front cover, one on the middle page, and the third on the
inside of the back cover.

The jewel case fits perfectly into a cardboard slipcase.

The RoboCop DVD includes the following ""Extras""/""Bonus Material"":

A commentary track, starring the Director, Paul Verhoeven; one of the Writers, Ed Neumeier; and Executive Producer, Jon
Davison

A commentary track, starring one of the Animators, Phil Tippett

A making-of documentary

A documentary about the villains of Old Detroit

a documentary about special effects then and ""now"" (presumably circa 2012)

deleted scenes

three other documentaries/featurettes about the creation of RoboCop

A question and answer session at the University of California in Los Angeles, in 2012, a quarter of a century after
the release of RoboCop in 1987.

The most interesting thing I gleaned from the Director's commentary is that the fancy, skyscraping office scenes
were filmed in Dallas, and the raunchy, post-apocalyptic looking scenes were filmed in Pittsburg, both of which cities had
been ravaged, in reality, by liberals, just like Detroit, which is where the not-so-futuristic, fictional story of RoboCop
takes place.

The most interesting extra, as far as I'm concerned, is the question and answer session at U.C.L.A., twenty-five years later...

Robert Rosen serves as the interviewer/Moderator.  He admits/brags that he already witnessed enough such events to realize
that these film producers are liberals.

Screenwriter Michael Miner pleads guilty as charged, and further confesses that he was a Viet Nam War protester who thinks
""American capitalism"" is ""out of control.""

His screenwriting partner, Ed Neumeier also acquiesces to the allegation, and, like the Moderator, seems a little
surprised that, in spite of RoboCop being ""very political,"" with a liberal slant, lots of conservatives like it, and lots of liberals don't.

To me, this comes as no surprise, because, although the liberal slant is nauseatingly apparent, the film actually shows
how liberalism has ravaged cities such as Detroit, and how important conservative values, such as the right to bear arms,
are, in order to prevent criminals and corrupt governments from riding rough shod over the freedom of the people.

The Dutch Director, Paul Verhoeven, denies, in his thick, foreign accent, having had any inkling that the film was political, but,
during the commentary track, his disdain for Americans is unmistakable. Personally, I think he lied, for political reasons; I think he knew very well that he was a co-conspirator in creating RoboCop to be leftist, anti-American propaganda.

 He seems to gloat as he talks about filming in a steel plant in Pittsburg, which had closed in 1985, because Americans were no
longer able to compete with Brazilian steel makers.  He also describes RoboCop as a Christ-like, American Savior, who, instead of saving Americans, kills them.  He apparently equates Americans in general to criminals and the lowest forms of life who should be exterminated by their Savior.

The most amusing thing about all this is how this trilogy apparently blew up in the creators' liberal faces, serving more as anti-liberal sermons than their intended, anti-capitalist and anti-American propaganda.",1473465600,,3611,5.324514991181658

157696,4,0792845765,"Actually, the answer is yes right now... you can pay more not to have that ridiculous 3rd Jetpack Ninja atrocity by just getting the newly released standalone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RoboCop-Unrated-Director-s-Cut-Blu-ray/dp/B00GST8UB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RoboCop (Unrated Director's Cut) [Blu-ray</a>], - the first Robocop included in this product trilogy collection is also the SAME EACT disc/artwork as the one from that product. I own both of them. (not to mention other Robocop DVD versions/steelbook and never-ending releases of the same film that they want us to keep consuming... can't wait for newly restored 8K Trilogy release 10 years from now!)

I just found out that they released this trilogy collection in May of this year (2014). Before, the blu-ray trilogy collection were out of print and very hard to find; people are still trying to sell them for over a hundred dollars. Thankfully, there's no need to be ripped off by those versions because they re-released this trilogy pack replacing the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop-with-the-newly-restored-HD-version/dp/B00GST8UB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop with the newly restored HD version</a>&nbsp;- so that old trilogy package is obsolete. Make sure it's the trilogy pack where Robocop has a side profile looking to the left (the old one, he's looking to the right)

The reason I bought this was because I really wanted to watch Robocop 2 in HD and I couldn't believe it was so difficult to find, not to mention, people were selling that standalone overpriced too.

I'm really thankful for this re-release trilogy package making it easily available for all of us now at a bargain price. I'm not sure if the current price is really a special sale or some kind of early promotion, but at $15, it is a no brainer to buy this one than any other versions out there.

The only reason to get the standalone first Robocop Blu-Ray is if you just care about the casing artwork - the artwork on the disc itself is the same thing. Personally, I like the simple clean side profile of Robocop on this Trilogy case - it looks nice and it comes with a slip case cover!

- The discs are not individually cased. They are all in one casing.
- Robocop 1 is the same exact disc as this product&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B00GST8UB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>.
- Robocop 2 and 3 has no bonus features. Just trailers.

The day I bought this trilogy, I can't believe I had a Robocop movie marathon!

I saw all 3 Robocop films back-to-back AND entire bonus content... (I was quite exhausted). I started with Robocop 2 and honestly, the 2nd one is not a bad movie at all - of course it's nowhere near as the original - nothing can come close to that perfection, but it has its moments; it's more violent than the first one and it's also quite hilarious in a good way (""Now, a word on nutrition..."" oh silly Robo...) Overall, I think it's a worthy sequel and has just as creepy villain (I watched it in theaters at the time too!).

And then I actually sat through the entire abomination of Robocrap 3... Like seriously, we all have to wonder who exactly allowed that mess to be made like that. How can they possibly make every single detail the wrong way? Clearly, all they cared about was selling toys with ninjas and jetpacks, but seriously... I don't think anyone can screw up a franchise more than how Robocop 3 ended up. Every single thing about that film was just beyond dreadful. Like EVERYTHING. I think student film can produce better. Fred Dekker, the director of Robocop 3, (look at his resume and you'll see he hasn't directed a thing after the mess he made) is clearly only suited for making really corny low-budget soap-opera/TV-style shows. You like cheap corny monster films and cheesy dialogues then you're possibly one of the few people who would dare say Robocop 3 wasn't bad.

It's really interesting to see the acting by the same actors, such as Lewis and Sergeant Reed, who were in all the other Robocop films and you can see how much of difference a director makes; it's the same people... Robocop 1, acting was just top notch by everyone including characters like Lewis And Reed. And then you take a look at Lewis and Reed in Robocop 3 - they're dialogues are delivered so over the top (not to mention the horrible writing), but they turned them into cartoon characters... it's just so so sad. You can't blame the actors there... It is the director.

When you watch Robocop 3, you just can't help but think you're watching a super low budget as if they're purposely trying to kill the franchise and make everything cheesy as one possibly could. Robocop 3 really has no story and he's not even the main spotlight. It's so torturing to watch Robocop in the 3rd film. He really does NOTHING, especially when he's fighting the Ninja... just laying there like an idiot and those god awful cheesy lines (after Robocop gets his fingers cut off and says ""(you are under arrest for) destruction of police property""). What kind of stupid line is that? Robocrap 3 is loaded with ridiculousness. I mean, I'm aware Robocop 1 and 2 had some cheesy lines of its own, but it mostly does it in a clever way; in Robocop 2, Robocop was saying all those stupid things but there was a point to that! With Robocop 3, it's just simply a stupid line with no merit. They really insult the viewers intelligence with brainless solutions; just throw in this little girl who carries a super computer that is miraculously capable of hacking anything... always comes to the REAL rescue -- not Robocop!

It's really amazing and interesting to see the contrast with Robocop 1 and 3 just from having different directors/team. With Robocop 1, you can see every department from writing, acting, music, editing, cinematography, the list goes on... Robocop 1 really puts so much heart and soul into it... that is why it is a timeless CLASSIC. And then you have Robocop 3 where EVERYTHING fails... as if the story and acting isn't clearly bad enough, the editing is a mess and the director has no idea where to que in the music at the right time like it is brilliantly done in the first Robocop. They recycled music from the first one in the 3rd one, but it's just a total mess. Robocop 3 just seems like some anti-Robocop executive purposely made a joke out of it and thinking he can buy a bigger yacht selling ninja jetpack toys.  *sigh* Robocop driving a pink car? It's like they truly wanted to mess it up on purpose and make a joke out of Robocop. What they did with the 3rd film is everything one shouldn't have done with Robocop. Imagine if the first Robocop script were handed to the director of Robocop 3, Fred Dekker, Robocop would never have been a world-wide icon or cult classic... I feel sick just thinking Robocop 3 even exists.

Robocop 1: 10/10
Robocop 2: 7/10
Robocop 3: 0/10

Did I mention how awful the 3rd one and how much I hate it?

Watch Robocop 1 to see what true artists can create with having the best writing/editing/acting/directing/cinematography/music/REAL special effects... you name it. And watch Robocop 3 for what you shouldn't do. I'm a huge Robocop 1 fan and always will be. NOTHING can ever top the original or replace it.

Robocop 1 is one of the most brilliant ahead-of-its-time sci-fi movie ever made. It's more than just your average mindless action with many many layers of intelligence and heart. If you just judge on the surface and movie title alone (like even the director himself did at first), then you're missing out. I'm glad CG wasn't around then and ED-209 looks intimidating and not silly like the 2014's video game ED-209.

I can watch Robocop 1 countless times and it never gets boring. It was released in 1987, yet it still feels fresh today. It's just THAT good and the pacing is fantastic. The true best movies always last forever. As cliche as that sounds, Robocop is one of the best films ever made. It also has the best villains in film history. It just has everything you'd want in a film. A character to root for... You really get the satisfaction ending and vengeance... one of the gangs ending up in the toxic waste? Come on!? It's just pure genius and creative... Not something stupid like a generic typical briefcase ticking time bomb blowing up a building and Robocop flies off on a jetpack... so so lame.",1401926400,14,8486,4.865650969529086
157697,4,0792845765,"Basically, what you're getting here is the old box set, only repackaged with the 2014 release of the original Robocop for the first disc. Now, Robocop 2 and 3 may lack any special features, but I found the transfers for those films to be noticeably cleaner than the original's. Aside from getting zero special features on the sequels' discs, the set is worth it, if you don't already own the movies individually on Blu-ray.",1401148800,23,423,4.72972972972973
157698,5,0792845765,"Let's get one thing straight right off the bat; I love all 3 Robocop movies. Unlike many people who love this crime-fighting cyborg, I did not grow up with these movies. I got into RoboCop about a year ago, so my perspective on the franchise may be a little different than others. This box set is essentially a standard blu-ray case housed in a glossy slipcover. The first movie in this 2014 trilogy collection is the uncut ""X-rated"" version of RoboCop. Needless to say, this movie is arguably one of the more solid entries into the sci/fi genre within the past couple decades. It has become a cult classic due to its creative visuals, compelling storyline, violence, and satiric nature. This disc is packed with all the features of the Remastered 2014 4K transfer of the film since it is the exact same disc. Therefore, along with all the substantial extras packed on this disc, you also get stunning video and audio; the best RoboCop has ever looked, and may ever look. For a full overview/review of this particular version, head on over to Bluray.com's review, which can be found here:[...]. Next up is the blu-ray version of RoboCop 2. Seen as the only ""worthy"" sequel of the franchise, this entry focuses on the war on drugs, more specifically, a drug called ""Nuke."" Although interesting, I felt that there wasn't enough RoboCop weaved into the storyline, which instead focuses on a handful of drug lords/goons. The idea of proto-Robocops with suicidal/homicidal tendencies was an interesting and humorous concept as was the concept of making RoboCop more ""kid-friendly"" by installing new directives. Ultimately, the story seems to go to some interesting places, but seems oddly uneven. The run time of nearly 2 hours seems to drag a bit after the first act and does not pick up until the third act. Video-wise and audio-wise, this transfer is pretty darn good. Sharpness and contrast levels are more tight than in the first installment, but ultimately does not live up to the legendary status of the original. Unfortunately, the only extras on this disc are two movie trailers. RoboCop 3 was actually a surprise. I read (over and over) of how horrible the movie was and how much people hate it because it wasn't as violent or as interesting. Contrary to what a lot of people think, I actually enjoyed this movie. It was interesting to see the once powerful company OCP (as depicted in RoboCop 1 and 2) become a corporation on the brink of bankruptcy and the various struggles it faces with a Japanese partner company. Although Peter Weller doesn't reprise his role as RoboCop in the third installment, Robert Burke does a decent job in filling Weller's suit. Although a couple of his movements are awkward, like having his arms stick out from his body when he's at rest, Burke does a fine job carrying on RoboCop's legacy of clever one-liners. Although a bit goofy at times, the script of RoboCop 3 was actually quite entertaining and would strongly recommend others to watch the film with an open mind. Unfortunately for Extras-enthusiasts, this disc only contains one trailer in the supplemental material department. On a positive note, the video and audio presented in this movie is definitely the best in the trilogy. I bought this movie for sixteen bucks like a month before it came out, but at thirty-three bucks, I still say it's worth it. However, I recommend potential buyers watch the last two movies before purchasing so that they may assess the value of this set.

157712,5,0792845765,"I bought the Bluray Trilogy set and wow! I guess it had been a long time since I had seen the first two. The first thing that struck me is that I felt sorry Robocop -  a man stripped of most of his humanity and put in this cold yet powerful machine. As a kid I could only think of how cool it would be to have the gun, the power, the vision and all that cam with it. Also I understand better the 80's capitalist ideas it was addressing. Those commercials in the middle are even funnier now that I understand them better. It's brilliant!

So I watched number 1 and it was great, but number 2 was not as good as I remembered, but I still enjoyed it. I had seen part three in the last few years, but would catch it half way through. It was much better than what it had been given credit for and flowed seamlessly with the other two. Peter Weller really should have revived the role. The acting was a little cheesy, but hey its Robocop. I think I'll be able to watch this Trilogy over and over I really enjoyed it.

157721,2,0792845765,"This review is for the MGM DVD release (for info on the Blu-Ray please skip to the last paragraph) which is the best and most complete set released for the trilogy. The MGM DVD comes with some extras and contains the unrated cut of Robocop. Special Features include: 4 deleted scenes, Flesh and Steel (Making of Robocop) featurette, Shooting Robocop featurette, another Making Robocop featurette, audio commentary, storyboard with commentary, photo gallery, 2 original theatrical trailers, TV Spot. Robocop is 103-minutes (Unrated Version), Robocop 2 is 117-minutes (R) and Robocop 3 is 105 minutes (PG-13). The MGM DVD version is worth tracking down. If you aren't interested in the sequels the advantage here is the unrated Robocop and 53 minutes of featurettes and other bonuses for the original that are absent from the BR release.

While I would give the movies 4 stars I am disappointed at the light treatment the Robocop film franchise has received. This is one of the most bland box sets ever produced (DVD or BD) when they could have at least tried to focus on the sequels. Robocop got a Criterion DVD release but it was an average release at best. Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 don't have special features other than trailers so they shouldn't be here. Less than one hour of special features for 3 films doesn't cut it. There is plenty of Robocop footage in the vault. The BD or DVD has no feature-length documentary to tie the entire franchise together. If you only want the original Robocop then buy the Criterion DVD.

157740,5,0792845765,"Robocop : Part man, part machine, all cop.  A classic 80's dystopian futuristic movie.  One of my personal favorite trillogies of all times, though as with many other series, the first is the best and they do go down hill from there.

In 1987 when it came out I loved this movie, what young boy wouldn't?  Of course looking back now, my parents probably shouldn't have allowed a 10 year old to watch it!  It was futuristic and cool, especially those futuristic looking cars (Ford Tauruses!).  It was action-packed, violent, and exciting.

Now today in 2013, I still appreciate it, but for other reasons.  It is classic 80's, with its dytopian future/evil corporation/gangs of bad guy drug dealers running the show type theme, and after all, I did grow up in the 80's.  Secondly, now that I am an adult myself I can see that it is almost comical with the absurd amount of over-the-top violence this movie has in it.  Supposedly for the first installment, they even had to ""tone it down"" from the original cut to avoid an ""X"" rating.  And also, I love cop movies, dystopian futurisitic movies, dark movies, and cheesy movies, and this has elements of all of the above.  And who doesn't get a kick out of seeing ""Red Foreman"" (Kurtwood Smith) as the main antagonist?  Of course there is Ronny Cox in his portrayal of ""Dick Jones"", big corporate sleezeball that you love to hate.

Again, the first one is by far the best, it has the best ensemble of actors, characters, best plot, and the best action.  The first one is definitely 5-stars for any 80's movie buff, or fan of shoot-em up action movies, cop movies, or old renditions on ""futuristic"" societies.  The second one is a bit cornier, but still pretty good, revolving heavily around the same drug-gang theme.  The third one, well, it is not so good, but it does have a very high cheeseyness factor, and really, if you are going to invest your time in the first two, you have to watch number 3.  What hurts 3 more than anything is Peter Weller's absence in the starring role.

The Robocop series holds a special place in my heart, up there with ""Total Recall"", ""Die Hard"", ""Terminator 2"" and other great action gems of the period.  If you are a 30-something guy like me, you have probably seen at least the first Robocop installment, but maybe not in a long time.  Treat yourself to this great shoot-em up, corny, over-the-top violent, cheesy special effects trillogy and have some laughs with your buddies.  You will be glad you did.",1361232000,,2486,4.6022727272727275

157744,4,0792845765,"I would give 5 stars to this trilogy but the truth is that I hate the third movie.
Robocop 1 is a classic that should be a part of your collection, bloody and gory with violence way ahead for that era. It contains some scenes that were cut in the theatrical version, like the OCP executive being shot by the ED 209 (you can see with details  his body receiving shots in a table) Murphy being shot with greater detail
Robocop 2 is pretty good, although it has some humor that doesn't fit in a movie like this one.
Robocop 3 is very very bad, starting with the fact that Peter Weller does not appear on it, and in a scene where robocop got shot with a bazooka, his armor appears to be damaged exactly as in robocop 2. Small details but for me makes a big difference when watching a movie.",1359417600,,786,4.171052631578948

Well it's got the trailers, that's it...no commentary or featurettes.

It's nice to have the original Verhoeven cut in HD (sort of), but if you're looking for the Robo version of something like the excellent Alien Anthology blu-ray set, this isn't it. Someone needs to broker a deal between MGM and the folks at robocoparchive.com, where the RA guys develop the ""special features disc"" and Hollywood's remastering ninjas really go to work on these films (or at least the first one), and do for them what was done for the Kubrick movies. The Shining blu-ray, for instance, makes that movie look like it was shot this year. Robo 1 still looks basically the same as it did on DVD.

In any case, perhaps one day Robo will get the massive blu-ray set he deserves, until then, seems like this will have to do. If the dearth of extras is a dealbreaker for you, it seems that the Criterion DVD is probably still the way to go.",1349827200,,1267,4.577092511013216

Audio is decent sounding although dialogue can get lost with the first film and that could easily have been remedied during the transfer stage.

Let blu-ray take over and throw quality out the window!.No way am i going to switch after collecting 1350 dvds for something as thin as BOLOGNA and for something that isn't Really that much better.

Now I read the Trilogy just packaged the three movies without re-mastering DVD.  I think the Laser Disc looked better (I don't have the DVD).  This is an example of how not to release a movie on Blu-Ray.

After this fiasco I was concerned when I ordered Cocoon & Star Man Blu-Ray editions, but they did remaster them for Hi-Def and did a good job.

these dvds are transfers not remastered, the sound quality is not much better than 2004 mgm fully loaded trilogy, yet this blu ray is bare-bones the films are not
much else worth while. to this day the blu ray industry insists on taking short-cuts

157790,3,0792845765,"I already have the Robocop Trilogy on DVD.  I bought this blu-ray version of the box set because I was expecting to see an improved High Definition re-master.  And it's not.  This transfer to Blu-Ray looks no better than the DVD's.  So, it's a waste of money, isn't it?

So, I've done a little research of some of my other re-purchased films on to Blu-ray (from MGM) and I've noticed that they too, were disappointments to me as a blu-ray transfer.  So, I know now: If it's released by MGM, it won't be any better than the DVD.  MGM just doesn't seem to care WHY we would re-purchase our favorite movies on to Blu-ray.

The first Robocop in this box set is the same 2007 release.  They didn't even bother to change the brownish artwork of the disc to match the other two movies bluer artwork.  And of course, there are no extras on any of these discs.

With the HDMI cable I had with my older regular DVD player, many of my regular DVD's were greatly improved in picture quality.  So, it's proving to be very few and far between that a Blu-ray reissue of a film is actually going to look any better. Some do.  I have about 75 Blu-Ray discs now, and only about 45 of them look greatly improved.  (When I buy the Blu-Ray, I compare them right away, side by side, Blu-Ray against the DVD, with my two TV's in my den)  I guess some movies can't be helped, while some other movies were great masters from the start so no re-mastering effort would be required.

I outta just re-cellophane this Robocop Blu-Ray and give it to somebody for Christmas because my DVD's are just as good anyway. I hope they will apply somewhat of a better effort to improve all the James Bond films onto Blu-Ray.

UPDATE: I've just recently bought a new 47"" LCD TV.  Maybe this was a mistake because it is NOW that I see a great improvement of my Blu-Ray DVD's over my regular DVD's.  So, I guess the only way that I can continue enjoying my regular DVD's is to keep watching my DVD's only on my 32"" LCD TV with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.  On the 47"" TV, regular DVD's just don't look that good.",1287878400,65,2122,4.297229219143577

157795,4,0792845765,Just to let everyone know if they are wondering the quality of this release on Blu Ray. I could not find any reviews that could give a good review on this set online since this set just came out. I have the Standard dvd version of the trilogy and I just recently got the Blu Ray version and did a comperison of them both. Your not going to get a crystal clear picture with the age of these movies unless the studio decides to spend the time and money doing a big picture cleaning restore like George Lucas or James Cameron would do with with their movies in the studio. It does sound better and the colors on blu ray do look better compared to the standard dvd. I was amazed how when Ed-209 in the first robo-cop made my sub-woofer on my surround system thump loud and robo-cops foot slaming on the ground as he get out the police car to fight crime. This set does contain the unrated edition of the first Robo-Cop. If you are buying this for sharp picture quality you will be disapointed. All 3 films do contain certain amounts of grain in the picture. The picture will balance from looking good to high amounts of grain in the video. It seems what the studio did was just take the video from the standard dvd set and put the video and sound onto blu ray uncompressed. I like the first 2 movies the most the third one was ok. Maybe the 3rd one could have been better if Peter Weller was Robo-Cop instead of the other actor that replaced him. I have seen all 3 of these in the theaters back then when they were released. I just wish the studios would have done a better job at restoring these movies better on blu ray. There are fans out there that do like Robo-Cop and would love to see better restored versions of these films.  I would rather watch the blu ray version of all 3 movies on a nice surround sound system than the standard dvd. The 4 stars are for having all 3 movies in one set and the upgraded sound on all 3 movies in the set compared to the standard dvd. If you don't have this set at all and a Robo-Cop fan pick this up on blu ray.,1286496000,23,2050,4.150753768844221

Runtime:
102 min  | Germany: 78 min (cut version)  | Norway: 98 min (cut version)  | USA: 103 min (unrated director's cut)  | Finland: 91 min (heavily cut)

the first is is 103 minutes so it's the unrated.

Now on to the dvd if you want it in hd i'm afraid its the same as the first. Heck even the disc is the same looking as the first release one.

What is cool is the boxart is slim and the artwork on the front and back is nice looking.
This is cool all 3 dvd's come in one standard blu-ray box so it is very slim.

They replaced it to have the scene where the car gets shot up before Robocop comes out.  I didn't see any other problems with the rest of the movie.  Then the third one was OK, I feel Peter Weller was the best actor for the Robocop role, but it was someone else.  You could tell that there was problem with the voice over when you stare closely at his mouth and what is actually being said.  Then what's up with making his voice more robotic when he is fully suited (helmet on)?  When ever he has his helmet off, he sounds like a regular person.  Then you have these guys from OCP wearing funny ass looking uniforms and the guy in charge of Rehab walks around without any body armour?  He must be invincible, who knows?  Besides those, it does have some good points.  It was funny how the little girl, Mariko, hacks a ED-209 when the rebels were breaking into the Police armory for weapons then some of the upgrades to Robocop was pretty good.

157807,4,0792845765,"Remember when Robocop used to actually NOT look cheesy?  Times have really changed.  There's some really goofy things that happen in the movie that drag it down a *little* bit.

First of all, the very bad animation of that one SUPER robot that came into the picture to eliminate Robocop.  Did you see how fake that thing looked?  It walked like it was walking on sandpaper.  It was not believable in the slightest that this devastating robot was actually *right next* to the people in that one office.

I liked how Robocop stopped acting so much like a threatening robot as the movie went on.  He had some human emotions that weren't really noticeable until near the end of the movie, when he started saying ""thank you"" to that one woman who gave him baby food (yes, that's right- baby food).  There's probably a joke behind that, about a big scary machine robot eating baby food.

One thing I found really funny was how the bad guys outside on the streets were standing around destroying everything with these new updated and extremely powerful guns, and yet, despite all those men in the police station, not ONE of them ran out there to see what was going on, haha.

I think the biggest problem is that Robocop just doesn't look BAD enough anymore.  He's calm, he's got some protection from bullets, and he's able to walk forward in a quiet intimidating matter.  But... I don't know.

A decent movie at any rate.  Just some comical segments that are only funny because the movie doesn't hold up as well as it used to back in the late 80's when it came out.  Some of the fighting scenes are really intense, and when the human being that turns into Robocop dies in the beginning, it was surprisingly graphic watching his head blow apart.

It's almost funny how close this is to being a bad movie or even a TERRIBLE movie. All the overzelous ""punks"" are here, the dated presentation, and some fairly aged stop motion animation would appear to add up to a RoboFlop. But dig deeper. Peter Weller practically single handedly turns this movie into something of legend. I will stop there. I don't want to give this movie too much praise because it does have some deep problems, but when you toll up the human element, the longing, the memory of family, his detachment, it practically is a modern day Frankenstein. The lead baddies are actually well represented and fleshed out, which is very important and the actual RoboCop ""gear"" still looks sweet and actually holds up well. I do get the feeling there were budget contraints but I'm shocked at this movie succeeding on many levels the Terminator misses. Throw in many dvd extras and the excellant box art and I can safely say this movie alone was worth the $15 I spent for the entire set. 8.5/10

RoboCop 2: 1990

For the first 45 minutes or so I was marveling at what may be a true stellar dark horse series. This second movie opened up getting everything right I liked about the first one... then at about that point the wheels fell off and the story suddenly went south with the telling of a second RoboCop... a drug addicted convict. Peter Weller may have been absent from half this movie! Which is really a shame because believe it or not most of cast isn't really that bad it's just that the story is so poorly constructed it's hard to even tell who, what, and mostly why. It's easier to digest once you realize this series seems to be purposely ""B movie"" material but it doesn't make it any more entertaining. I did find it interesting to see Robo riding a Harley... 2 years before Arnold. 6/10

RoboCop 3: 1992

Sort of works as a ""bad movie"". The Neo Punk look and most of the actors range from horrid to so-so. Peter Weller is no longer RoboCop which surprisingly doesn't affect this movie as much as I thought it would. Still how can you have a RoboCop movie where, again, he is missing from half the movie and you spend that time watching uninteresting ""rebel movements"" and even worse, bad robot ninjas? I really cannot understand how the script was approved. Through it all it was marginally entertaining but definitely the worst of the three.

157817,4,0792845765,"I won't even review Robocop 2 and 3, they are bad movies. Robocop 2 is somewhat funny in a bad way and mean spirited while Robocop 3 is commercial and childish. Let's get to the goods.

Robocop 1 exists in several versions on DVD, the old, crusty Criterion Collection version with the X-rated scenes ( for violence, not sex! ), the standard MGM version which is R-rated and finally this MGM Trilogy set which also has the X-rated scenes too. The picture in this boxed set trilogy version is the same picture quality you get in the other MGM release and it is much better than the Criterion Collection, which by today's standards doesn't look so hot anymore.

One thing that annoyed me is that the formerly cut scenes are hastily inserted into the movie and some of the shots look grainy in comparison to the rest of the movie. The sound is remastered in the cut scenes, so that's good. So when Murphy is being killed, the picture quality is just like the rest of the movie but when we get a quick shot of the killers laughing, it looks grainy. Strange. It's not that big of a deal but you know, I'm hardcore about movies and Robocop is one of my favorites.

Another thing that might annoy people who are freaks about this is that the film is framed in 1.85.1 as opposed to 1.66.1 in the Criterion Collection. Supposedly Verhoeven's approved version is framed at 1.66.1. I won't even begin to explain all the nonsense about film framing on DVD, the people who know what I'm talking about already understand. It might actually work out for the best in the end if you do buy this Trilogy set Robocop instead of the Criterion Collection. Say for instance you have a high-definition widescreen TV, this Trilogy set edition of Robocop will give you much more pleasure than the Criterion Collection with it's framing and grainy picture quality.

The extras in this package, ( documentaries, interviews, lost clips ), outshine the extras on the Criterion version. If you're a Robocop fan, you might want to own both, like I do.

As for the movie itself, what else can be said? It's a bonafide classic. The film works on so many levels. As science fiction, as satire of capitalist society, as a document of social depravity and immorality, as a human story about a man who loses everything and then regains his soul. Existentialism and all that and the film even works as an action movie, a revenge story for god sakes! Peter Weller gives his greatest contribution to cinema in his noble, dignified performance and this film is not only the best American movie Paul Verhoeven directed, it's the best film he's ever made, period. Did I forget to mention the score by Basil Poledouris, wow! Does Hollywood even attempt such multi-layered sci-fi films nowadays? Doesn't seem like it!

And because the first Robocop film is so good, it really pisses me off that the inevitable sequels are so bad! They are in this trilogy set more as extras than capable films of their own. Don't worry, the picture and sound is very good in both Robocop 2 and 3.

Still, if you want the first film, uncut and looking and sounding terrific, you should own this set as it's ultimately preferable to the Criterion version.",1139097600,6,3190,4.6155202821869485

ROBOCOP is a modern science fiction masterpiece. The future is not black and white, as most sci-fi tales conform to. It is a utopia of white-teeth propaganda but its black tarred heart beats a dystopian horror. ROBOCOP has been misunderstood simply as an eighties violent action picture. It is a lot more than that.

Firstly, integral satire thumps hard at its core - big business is the new `democracy' (or lack of) and money is God. Falling human values and decency are humorously mocked (the family playing the `nuke' game) and the price of human life is devalued.

Robocop is a sort of iron messiah, almost Christ-like - for example, he is a morally strong man, gunned down doing something he believed in, was `resurrected' and eventually became an iconic figure for hope in a city falling into apathetic hell and crime.

The film is extremely violent, but it never seems gratuitously (there for the sake of it). The violence highlights the cold heartless vision of the future that our future relatives will inevitably inherit (are we not too far off now from that dystopia?) I saw this film on British television years ago, with censored `television-friendly' cuts. This made the film feel subdued in its message, and it lacked the brutal force of the uncut version (even the cutting of swear words gave the film a less realistic, less-grimmer feel).

Peter Weller is an inspired choice for the dual role of Officer Murphy (married family man, nice suburban home) and his resurrected entity - Robocop. The armour suit is brilliantly created, and seems well ahead of its time - example the gun holster in his leg (this is pre-CGI). Nancy Allen, plays his bolshy side-kick who also holds a high moral compass.

The stop-motion animation seems a tad dated (ED-209 falling down the stairs for example) even though it was made in 1987, but the sets are well-made and the difference between the urban decay below and the modern settings of the OCP buildings are well contrasted (the office buildings are grey and colourless, devoid of any human touches or character).

The intertwining news features, and faux advertisements, satirise a scrupulous modern media relationship with the `consumer'.

Apparently, Paul Verhoeven wanted a futuristic city created (see Starship Troopers) but budget restrictions forced him to settle for modern day looking Dallas. This works well in Verhoeven's favour, as the city feels deprived and the overall feeling is that this bleak future is not too far off.

The sequels and the TV spin-off (aimed at kids!), fortunately, does not devalue this movie, as this film stands alone. Some say it is the greatest sci-fi to come out of the eighties, I think it is the best to come out ever (alongside Metropolis, Terminator, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey), though people who think its gory violence is unnecessary, will disagree.

ROBOCOP 2: Three stars

The inevitable sequel is not as bad as some make out; though, compared with the original, it fails on all levels. Released with a surge of hype in 1989, this will fill only those who saw the first as a violent action picture, rather than the layered modern sci-fi it really is.

It's portrayal of a new drug culture offers nothing new, and seems pretty lazy and easy as a purpose to satirise. The villain, Cain, a sort of hippy throwback, seems a bit too much of a `superhero' villain (i.e. wacky, unconventional) to offer any gritty realism (unlike the first). Irvin Kershner, the director who gave us the most fulfilling Star Wars episode - The Empire Strikes Back, seems to lack the social and political bite that Verhoeven created with the first movie.

However, if you see the film in the right light - as a comic-book style movie, then ROBOCOP 2 is elevated somewhat. There are parts when satire does sparkle, for example, where Robocop/Murphy is `reprogrammed' and set back out onto the streets is a vicious swipe at OTT political correctness and liberalism (as the first movie took a swipe at conservatism and big business fascism).

The violence is not as brutal and realistic as the first one, but it is still far off the `children' friendly Robocop spin-offs that follow this movie.

News bulletins and faux advertisements return, but this time they feel too absurd, and instead of satirising modern western media, it simply parodies the first film.

I would rate this film three stars.

ROBOCOP 3: One star

If the second Robocop movie has some redeemable features, then the third instalment has hardly any. This film is the metamorphous of the Robocop franchise into a kid's marketed commodity. In this respect, this film seems to be a pilot for the children-friendly television series that soon followed (though this film is not be confused WITH the television show pilot).

The violence is low key and the inclusion of a child actor as one of the main central characters seems to confirm this. Maybe this was the inevitable conclusion - Robocop has all the hallmarks of a `superhero' and the commercialisation of this towards the children's toy market/comics may gather a new audience (young viewers) but will alienate an older audience at the same time. The superhero theme is cemented with Robocop's new jetpack and the `ninja' style villains (this movie was released when the ninja turtles franchise was in full swing).

It is ironic that this film should be included to make the series a `trilogy'. Parents who have seen this movie - and the television series - may find the first two films a total shock.

The film also lacks the budget of the first two movies, which was a surprise as Robocop 3 was very hyped up to its confusing release date (set back time after time with delays) and was released in Britain straight-to-video.

This film can be viewed as a pilot, of the pilot of the tv series. Parents who wish to buy this trilogy because of Robocop's `revamp' into a children's `action figure' toy may have an unpleasant surprise with the first two movies, so I suggest buying Robocop 3 on its own.",1134691200,5,6023,4.844206426484908

Robocop 3 is why I called this review - one movie too many.  This movie at best is only a 2 star movie. That is why I give the box set only a 3.

Robocop 1 is such a great movie! Watching it now is a lot better than it was when I watched it as a teenager. It was great back then, but there was so much that I didn't pick up. Watching it now from a man's prospective is a totally different experience.
The version of Robocop 1 in this set is the ""un-rated"" version. I would definitely keep it away from children. Some of the scenes are a lot more gory and grusome than they were in the ""R"" rated version (A LOT MORE!) and on it's own, this version is hard to find.  Robocop 3, on the other hand, is more family oriented and only rated PG-13. The violence from the previous movies has been toned down quite a bit and there is no use of the ""F"" bomb. It's a nice movie, but it does not have the same feel of the other two(or actor. Peter Weller chose not to return.)

157827,5,0792845765,"I was skeptical about this when I first saw it at the store, as I already owned the fantastic Criterion edition DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new MGM unrated version found in the Trilogy boxed set is well worth it.  So here is a review for people who already own the Criterion disc and are wondering if they should shell out their hard earned cash for this newer DVD.
Here are the differences I found between the new disc and the Criterion one...
PLUSES:
a.. Anamorphic widescreen.  The Criterion disc was not anamorphic.  As a result, the picture on the MGM disc is a lot less pixellated than the Criterion one.  The color is also more saturated.
b.. New sound mix.  The Criterion disc was mixed in Dolby surround.  The new mix is in Dolby 5.1, and they obviously had fun remixing it.  The surrounds are split and very directional.  The sound is really an improvement in every way (see (d)).
c.. It's the same unrated cut that was on the Criterion disc.
d.. They fixed some of the excrutiatingly bad sound edits that were on the Criterion disc.  Although Criterion had re-edited the violent footage back into the movie, they neglected to remix the sound for those moments, ie. they didn't remix the sound to blend the new footage.  On the new MGM disc, they FINALLY fixed this.  Now the new footage sounds like it was SUPPOSED to be there.
e.. As one reviewer mentioned before, the director's commentary on the MGM disc is new and completely different than the one on the Criterion disc (ie. don't throw away your Criterion disc).
f.. We finally have the sequels in anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1.  This is a plus or a minus depending on if you enjoy them or not!  Although it would have been nice to have a longer version of Robocop 2, as Frank Miller has alluded that huge chunks of that movie were edited out of the final version.
g.. The new MGM version of Robocop also has some good documentaries and other curiosities for you to peruse (only on the unrated cut).  These are NOT available on the bare-bones theatrical DVD that MGM has out for individual sale.
------------
MINUSES:
a.. The picture is a bit darker on the MGM disc than on the Criterion disc.
b.. The director's commentary was recorded when they were watching the theatrical cut of the movie, so it is oddly funny (and a bit distracting) that they will be commenting, ""remember how we had to cut out the more violent shot of...."" when we at home are actually watching the footage that they are talking about.
c..  If you don't like the sequels, it sucks to be you, because the only way to get the unrated cut of the first movie is to buy the boxed set.
d..  Don't really know if this is a minus or not as I'm not 100% sure what Verhoeven's intention was.  The Criterion disc is framed at 1.66:1, and the new MGM disc is framed at 1.85:1.  As it is, Criterion tends not to mess around.  I'd wager that it's supposed to be projected at 1.66:1.  Either way, 1.85:1 still looks pleasing.
-----------
All in all, more pluses than minuses I wager.  I found that the new version has everything the Criterion one had, and it presents it in a more pleasing manner (sound, picture, extras, etc..).  If you're a fan, I think this would be right up your alley.",1087862400,148,3244,4.461016949152542
157828,4,0792845765,"The one thing that doesn't seem to be getting any fanfare, with the new release of this trilogy from MGM, is the fact that the first movie, is in fact, the UNCUT DIRECTOR's CUT, that was presently, till now, only available on the out of print (and pricey) Criterion version of this DVD.
Oddly enough, even the new trilogy packaging and extras, don't go out of their way to press, what you'd think would be a GREAT selling point, almost as if the decision to use the directors cut, was a last minute thing.
Funny enough, even the commentary (which, unfortunately, is NOT the commentary present on the Criterion disc) was made, with the director and crew, watching the theatrical version of the movie, as they keep referring to this fact, and discussing the deleted scenes, EVEN as we, the viewers, are watching the very scenes that they are saying are missing in this version. It also amazes me, as to how they managed to sync up the commentary to the cut film, over top of the uncut film, without any lag or dead spots, where the cut scenes are replaced, but they did it.
One thing that MGM did fail in though, is that they placed back in the cut scenes, but didn't bother to colour correct, or do anything, to make the scenes run seamlessly, as you can always spot the new scenes, by the sudden loss of quality in the picture, which, in itself, is another reason that you'd think that MGM would have indicated that this was the uncut version, and explained (as most movies that add in extra scenes, but don't bother trying to fix them up) that the extra scenes have not been cleaned up, so that the viewer doesn't think that the film has glitches, or that MGM's quality is inconsistent (as the overall picture quality is pretty descent, except for the extra scenes, that is).
Another complaint about the new set, is the stupidly constructed fold out packaging, as it boggles my mind, as to why they couldn't just use the new, slim DVD cases, in the box set slip cover, instead of the ""Road Map-like"" fold out, that you get.
You technically need a whole kitchen table to open the set up on, just to extract one disc from the set.
BUT, that said, for the money, this set is VERY good, and definitely worth getting.

157829,4,0792845765,"What I find disturbing on Amazon.com and most other DVD sites is the lack of information about a release's format. All three ROBOCOP films are finally in Anamorphic Widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1. This is the first time Robo 2 and 3 get anamorphic releases, so for me, this alone was worth the cost, since I already owned the definitive Criterion Robocop. This is a slightly better release, however, in that it has some featurettes and trailers. It's great to finally watch Robo 2 (and the slightly sillier Robo 3) in Anamorphic Widescreen on my 65"" HDTV, and in DD 5.1!

And I never thought the movie was written what used to be my favorite comic book writer Frank Miller. Dissapointment it is.

157832,3,0792845765,"ROBOCOP - The '87 blockbuster that started it all. Look, I'm well aware that this is not the ""greatest"" movie of all time, but it sure is my favorite. I grew up with it. I mean, true, the film's violence is pretty nasty an' unremitting even by today's standards (in fact, movies have gotten TAMER since then), but once you get past that you'll find an incredible world here that Paul Verhoeven created that has influenced many other films. It's cold an' cynical society is established through sardonic television news, commercial products, big business conferences, an' the idea that the body of a hero cop killed in the line of duty could be used as the blueprint for a new brand of law enforcement (marketed not by the police force, but by a major corporation). The movie is wickedly satirical, but there is also an incredibly human story beneath the surface, as Robocop, the half-man/half-machine, begins to re-discover his past and what he was, which makes him further resent what he has been turned into. If you're looking for the ultimate sci-fi movie, no need to look further. THIS is it. A modern classic.

ROBOCOP 2 - In some ways, 'Robocop 2' is a really underrated movie. I mean, it really is almost just as creative as the original in a lot of ways. During a huge citywide police strike, Robocop is the lone officer that patrols the crime-filled streets, now completely overrun with designer drugs and heartless thieves an' criminals. The OCP corporation that created Robocop (and runs the city's police force) is apparently oblivious to all. The chairman played again by Dan O'Heirley has gotten wildly out-of-control after his massive success with law enforcement, and decides to up the ante by creating a newer version of their original Robocop. I shouldn't give too much away, but there's quite a few cool touches to this one, although the film loses its bottom by the end and becomes almost a parody of itself. Overall an above average sequel that just barely falls short. Now...

ROBOCOP 3 - Ohhh, boy. Here's the Robocop movie that you can skip, and not miss a thing. I don't think there is one redeemable quality about this film. The plot is basically OCP running thousands of citizens out of their homes to make room for urbanization and high-rise office buildings. A small citizens' uprising begins underground, raging guerilla warfare against the capitalist army. Robocop, sensitive to the little people as he is, decides to join them and assist the rebel forces in their crusade. Even the appearance of veteran actors like Rip Torn and CCH Pounder can't save this awful mess. The story plays like an after-school special, with cheesy morals being plastered in your face, an' awful dialogue an' corny one-liners from every character that will make you wince with embarrassment. Peter Weller, who played Robocop excellently in the first two films, is replaced by Robert John Burke, and, although you wouldn't think it would be all that noticeable due to Robocop's limited dimensions, it's ANNOYINGLY noticeable.

Overall, the DVD set is nothing really amazing, with hardly any features on any one of the discs. But at least the films are shown in Widescreen format, the way the movies were presented in theaters, and the sound and picture quality is obviously sharper an' clearer than my beat-up, worn-out VHS copies. Any fan of this series should be happy purchasing this collection for the simple fact of having the complete trilogy. It's not likely that the Robocop series will ever be resurrected (especially not after the UNFORGIVEABLE third film), but I'll never get sick of watching and remembering how fresh, sardonically funny, and action-packed the first two were, and how I seemed to never get sick of the half-man/half-machine police officer who went out against all the odds, refused to let go of his humanity, and dished out some cold justice against the deplorable criminals who made him what he was.",1017878400,28,3937,4.908408408408408
