8306678,5,B001GQFAOS,A great work in documenting a style of Pa-Kua. A large amount of material is presented and one should also have the accompanying book to get the most out of the work. Martial art DVDs are always a trade off in how much to present vs. how in depth they go on each concept. This is a example of the former. If you have a solid background in the martial arts you will get much more than a beginner.,1421712000,7,395,4.012658227848101
8306679,5,B001GQFAOS,I bought this at the same time that I bought the book of the same name and the DVD demonstrates many concepts that would be difficult to understand from reading alone. I highly recommend this DVD.,1376697600,8,196,4.472222222222222
