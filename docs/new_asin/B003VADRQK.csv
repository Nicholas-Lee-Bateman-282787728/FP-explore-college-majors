8406600,5,B003VADRQK,"What a beautiful narrative and story of three unique places on earth. This is one of my favorite dvds on my shelf, the scenery will leave you in awe. It's not a bluray but the video quality is excellent, don't hesitate to buy it for the quality. My favorite is the story of Hawaii, it's birth, it's beauty and history, and the eventual slow death of the islands, what a story! Hey, it's just a little over $5, what's not to like?",1434499200,,429,4.2439024390243905

8406603,4,B003VADRQK,"NOT an atlas. Rather a collection of places and things that happened there. This is basically a travelogue having little, if anything, to do with maps and/or mapping. Interesting, but not what I expected. Stories about three locations, The great rift valley of Africa and its history, a history of Hawaii, and a story about mans interaction and growth in the Mediterranean. The fact I found most interesting waws that when the dam between Gibralter and Africa broke, it took the Atlantic ocean 4,000 years to fill the Mediterranean basin. That's a LOT of water! There is much else you may find interesting. Probably not of a lot of interest to the pre-teen group (probably pretty enough to keep their attention though), but your teenagers might really like it.",1420502400,,760,4.89922480620155
8406604,5,B003VADRQK,I love this documentary.,1419552000,,24,5.25
8406605,5,B003VADRQK,"One of the most informative documentaries I have seen in a long time. The narrative kept me very interested and the photography was astonishing. If I am not mistaken one of the chapters showed briefly how the fleet of the Pacific was sank by a hurricane or a typhoon near the Philippines during World War II. Mmm, I thought the Japanese had sunken it first at Pearl Harbor. Maybe the documentary described an event that happened to another Pacific Fleet or at another time or maybe the Fleet had already been rebuilt at the Hunters Point Shipyard in San Francisco. Anyhow I enjoyed the collection very much from start to end and in the process ran across some interesting History contradictions.",1406678400,,695,4.75206611570248
8406606,3,B003VADRQK,"The first three episodes were incredibly educational and very well done.  On the fourth episode they decided to change the format to ""action and adventure with Olly Steed"".  Very quickly changed my reaction from ""fantastic!"" to ""can't stand another minute"".",1400803200,3,257,5.4
8406607,5,B003VADRQK,"This dvd is superb.  Excellent blend of geography, science and history (of the earth).  This is a great teaching tool for earth science.  Very informative and interesting",1374624000,6,170,5.222222222222222
