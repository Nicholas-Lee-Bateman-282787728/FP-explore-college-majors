1907608,5,B0000AKCJO,Elijah Wood is in this movie! What else do i have to say! Hey if you want to see a really funny movie w/ elijah in it...see The Ice Storm!,1065312000,,138,3.6333333333333333
1907609,5,B0000AKCJO,simply a nice film and the sound track was good 2.,1064793600,,50,3.6363636363636362
1907610,4,B0000AKCJO,I rented this movie simply because I'd heard of it previously since I adore Elijah Wood. I think this was a great movie. Very cute in it's own little romantic way. He's adorble and the movie is as well. I think it's a nice rany day movie for any elijah or screwy indie fan.,1064707200,,273,4.074074074074074
1907611,1,B0000AKCJO,"I admit, i purchased ""All I Want"" (formerly known during production as ""Try Seventeen"") for Elijah Wood, yes, i admit. I was very excited when i heard a movie with Elijah Wood, Franka Potente, and Mandy Moore was being made because I absoluetly love them all. When I started to watch the film, it's opening was a bit iffy, but all doors were open. As the film got rolling, I found myself becoming more and more disinterested. There were some moments I found myself cringing from the acting. At others, I felt myself doze off into a fuzzy haze of bordom. By the end I wished i had my two hours back, and cursed the writer and director for their shoddy job. The movie had great potential, but in the end, was predictable, and uninteresting. I give it one star for (*) a waste of two hours, don't waste your time.",1064448000,,810,4.370860927152318
1907612,5,B0000AKCJO,I really liked this movie it was funny and has replay value. Mandy does a great job playing lisa. Elijah wood is good too even though it seemed funny seeing frodo smoking and drinking. A must for a fan for either actor.,1064361600,,219,4.238095238095238
1907613,4,B0000AKCJO,"It is hard to classify this movie, it was not very funny and the drama was light.  This is leaves the description of quirky.  Bought this DVD as the only way to see Mandy Moore's performance (movie never released to theaters).  She was 18 when this was filmed.  She shows she can carry herself with more veteran actors, and will be a great star once she is given good material.  Like her recent theater release ""How to Deal"", ""All i want"" has a poorly thought out slow paced script.  This movie shows she has the talent to play mature characters, not just high school kids.
This movie is worth a look, Elijah Wood plays his character (Jones Dillon) with a tongue in cheek seriousness, but is clearly having fun.  He has scenes where he appears child like, but this is countered by his skill at purchasing booze with fake id and a line, and his adult interactions with his mother (Elizabeth Perkins).  The movie falls flat at the end, it was almost like the director stuck a pin in the overinflated plot which then collapses.  High rating is due to Mandy Moore and Elijah Wood's performances.  I enjoyed it overall especially as they shot scenes at my school, the University of British Columbia.  Rent it, not worth purchasing.  Paid about $18, too much as there are no extra features.",1064016000,2,1284,4.558951965065503
1907614,4,B0000AKCJO,"I enjoyed  All I want is all I need. I found it quirky & entertaining. Elijah Wood is the sardonic and jaded about his own life, but naieve about relationships.  I found a lot to laugh at, especially his frankness to Lisa (Mandy Moore). His neighbors are an eclectic assortment that help him learn about life.  Elizabeth Perkins embodies the Country Club mom.  I found this different from the average  same old story line.",1063843200,2,422,4.648648648648648
1907615,4,B0000AKCJO,"""All I Want"" is not so much a quest for cool as it is a quest for identity. As a teen romance, the film flops. As an intriguing independent coming-of-age story, it soars.
The film opens with wretched cliches: freshman-baiting bullies, a blond sexpot (Debbie Harry), and Oedipal red neck intimidators. But just as the despair-factor begins to take hold, Jones Dillon (Elijah Wood) pays a visit to his neighborhood convenience store. He picks up a case of beer, a pack of cigarettes, and attempts a pickup of his unknowing new neighbor, Jane (Franka Potente).
Happy-puppy Jones follows street-smart Jane to the apartment building they both share. Disaster unfolds. Jane maces Jones as he approaches her in the front hall. A helpful neighbor (Andrew Jackson) appears with a six-shooter and an attitude. The scene leaves you wincing and laughing. Action and interest perk up from that moment on.
This is a subtle, quirky film. Off beat humor and tender scenes are enhanced by a good alternative music soundtrack. Wood has fine moments as his character learns to furnish an apartment, open a bottle of wine, and, eventually, to relinquish long held fantasies.
But the whole cast creates an ensemble of believable and empathetic characters, from Potente's edgy photographer to Mandy Moore's self-absorbed wannabe actress. Elizabeth Perkins, playing Jones' Holly-Go-Lightly mother, is a heartbreaker. But it's all held together by Wood's engaging Jones.
When ""All I Want"" finally takes aim, it hits the target.",1060646400,8,1503,5.189300411522634
1907636,4,B0000AKCJO,I loved this movie. I really don't know why. I just saw it and all my friends thought it was stupid but I liked it. This was a movie about love that just kinda played with your mind. The end of the movie left a lot of questions to be asked but I like movies like that. All and all the story was good and the acting was ok (they could have gotten better actors but hey no movie is perfect.),1110153600,,389,3.814814814814815
1907637,2,B0000AKCJO,"to be honest, i rented this movie about a year ago and don't remember anything except that it was just okay.  actually, i don't remember it being that great at all - maybe even trying a little too hard to be artsy-fartsy.  but i'll tell you what, that frodo is a cute little guy!",1103155200,2,279,4.148148148148148
1907638,3,B0000AKCJO,"Also known as inexplicable 'Try Seventten,' 'All I Want' stars Elijah Wood, Franka Potente ('Run Lola Run'), Mandy Moore ('Walk to Remember'), and Elizabeth Perkins.  The film, as you know, seems to have been directly sent to video, in spite of the presence of Frodo, and if you see the film, you soon realize there are good reasons behind that.

The story is just a standard one, about a seventeen-year-old boy Jones (Wood), coming from Texas (where he lived with his mom always drinking), and without reasons he drops out from the college on the first day.  Jones instead takes up a room, where he meets unique characters, photographer Franka Potente, and actress-wannabe Mandy Moore.

Romance ensues, but not in the way we expect.  Actually, Ms. Moore's role is not as big as you suppose, and (as you see for yourself in the opening 30 minutes) it's Ms. Potente that steals the heart of Jones, and the film itself.  But how could an immature 17-year-old boy with a bad habit of daydreaming be the love of this elder, tough, and independent woman with a fragile heart?

The story itself is promising, and the film is not totally bad, like 'Gigli' or something.  'All I Want' is (at least) trying to be a comfortable romance with love story, and possibly healthy amount of humor.  Endure the awfully slow and contrived opening 30 minutes, and you will pretty enjoy yourself.

But the film is flawed at many points.  First of all, Elijah Wood (b. 1981) never looks seventeen, even with his wide eyes.  To make matters worse, his acting here is too bland.  Incredible as it sounds, but I couldn't tell whether it's Wood's character or Wood himself that looks very boring on the screen.

The poor direction doesn't help, either.  The boy's frequent 'fantasy' is strictly amateur hour, each shot annoyingly lacking the quality of real fantasy.  His family history back in Texas sorrounding Elizabeth Perkins's character is nothing original, let alone amusing or touching.

Perhaps 'All I Want' can be best enjoyed as love story of Franka Potente, who alone can brings life to this oft-told story that looks assembled from better movies about teens and teenage angst, like John Hughes back in the 80s.  Watch her, or old Hughes for that matter.",1093219200,4,2240,4.804177545691906
1907639,4,B0000AKCJO,"It's tough being a seventeen-year-old virgin. Especially one with an active imagination, and gallons of hormones. Or at least, it's tough for Jones Dillon, the slightly neurotic teenage hero of ""All I Want,"" a fitful but rather amusing romantic comedy that breaks some rules and sticks religiously to others.

 Seventeen-year-old Jones (Elijah Wood) arrives at a university -- unless he enrolls, he can't access the sizable inheritance his grandpa left him. But after being scared off by the roommate from hell, he drops out and heads to a local sublet apartment building. The building comes with some unusual roommates: gay cowboy Brad (Aaron Pearl), sultry aspiring actress Lisa (Mandy Moore), and sullen photographer Jane (Franka Potente).

 Settling into his new home, Jones bickers with his estranged mother from Texas, and writes (very imaginative) letters to the mysterious father he never knew. But to deal with the problems of his life, this confused teen will have to face up to the reality around him -- and the women who want him. Especially when he learns that the truth is harsh, and might just break his heart.

 Romantic comedies are a dime a dozen, and most of them are forgotten the moment the credits roll. In contrast, ""All I Want"" (original title: ""Try Seventeen"") manages to be pretty memorable. Different settings, different characters, and a different kind of lead -- rather than a Holden Caulfield wannabe or a stud, Jones is the kind of likable kid who lives down your street.

 The script is somewhat flawed. The ending is pure Hollywood cliche. And it's hard to see why Jones would prefer the alcoholic and abusive Jane over the sweeter if sluttier Lisa. However, relative directing newbie Jeffrey Porter shows plenty of quirks and humor that you won't find in any Julia Roberts comedy -- Jones daydreaming about blasting a car with a bazooka, while blonde bombshells fawn over him, is especially funny.

 Elijah Wood gives a wonderfully nuanced, layered performance as Jones, a naive teenager whose life is in a tangle. Wood plays Jones as a sweet, wistful lad with some unusual quirks, but also gets to be rough'n'tough in the delicious ""revenge"" scene near the end. Mandy Moore shares good chemistry with him, and gives astonishing depth to what could have been a soulless role; her Lisa is flawed, but a pleasant person with regrets and personality. And most memorable is Blondie singer Debbie Harry, as a sexy matron who invades Jones's dreams.

 A fun if flawed romantic comedy, ""All I Want"" features excellent acting from Wood and Moore, and a likably quirky sensibility. Fun and cute, and certainly worth curling up in front of.",1091404800,13,2664,4.975225225225225
1907640,2,B0000AKCJO,"I watched All I want, and it was all I wanted. It's a film with weird characters, the weirdest was Wood's fantasy imagination. The movie goes nowhere and is a 93 minute mess.",1089936000,,174,4.303030303030303
1907641,2,B0000AKCJO,"This movie was so boring it was a drag to watch, it was cheezy too but I saw worst but I SURE saw better.  If you are a fan of Elijah Wood or Mendy Moore I guess you will like this movie but I sure didn't!",1084752000,,205,3.4565217391304346
1907642,4,B0000AKCJO,"Elijah Wood fans will like this movie.  His performance was great.  It's alittle confusing if you don't pay attention (fantasy or dream sequences).  It is a sweet and funny coming of age movie.  All the actors gave good performances.  It is a bit of chick flick but not just for teens, as I am definately not a teen.",1082073600,2,316,4.379310344827586
1907643,4,B0000AKCJO,"I came across this movie during a visit to my DVD retailer after seeing Mandy Moore's latest film ""Chasing Liberty"". Having seen all three of the main characters in other work, I wasn't sure if this movie was worth the price to own, so I went and rented it. Aside from some of the predictable ""plot lines"" in the film, I enjoyed the film, right down to the soundtrack, which I can't say the same for some of the other films that were released about the same year as this one.
If you're looking for a film to complement this one, I would check out ""Just Write"" starring Jeremy Piven, as they have some of the same subject matter (writer, personal ghosts to overcome, going after what you want, etc.), not to mention the fact that both Jeremy and Mandy appeared in ""Chasing Liberty"" which I also liked.",1077926400,,800,4.412162162162162
1907644,3,B0000AKCJO,"Darn it, but I wanted this to have a better ending than it did!  ""All I Want"" (Try 17) starts out wonderful.  Elijah fans will love the way this film starts: lots of fun, lots of sexual tension, the Thurber-like fantasy his character slips into as a way to treat the jerks he encounters (hey, we all could use a bazooka now and then ^_~), it's all quite fun and quite funny.  The film has an R rating for the language and sexual situations (though you don't actually see anything!).  Elijah plays this gawky teen (who seems to have come into just enough inheritance to let him live comfortably and not have to work) who drops out of college on the first day.  There's just enough slapstick to keep you wanting to see if he indeed can carry a comedy, and a physical one at that.  He finds am apartment in a boarding house that has several quirky residents, all with their own little stories.  When he is about to be deflowered by the used furniture store lady (Debbie Harry is a hoot!) you keep expecting Samwise Gamgee to come running in and rescuing him.  But now that you've totally gotten ""Frodo"" out of your mind (and you will after Elijah comes to <cough> from this particular fantasy), you can sit back and watch Elijah's character lust between his two lovely neighbors in the boarding house.
Elijah's character narrates now and then as he types his feelings and fantasies down on paper (some of these fantasies are very funny), using his dad's typewriter (was he going to become a writer, then? there's a hint of that)in letters that he saves, because he doesn't know where to send them; mom won't tell him.  Very touching actually, clinging to a past life he wants to hang onto, but one that his mom has not interest in.  I would have liked a bit more of the back story about his wayward parents (or lack of dad and why he calls his mom by her first name) but that didn't distract me too much as you will get more details, of course, towards the end of the story.
The downstairs cowboy neighbor is refreshing and unfortunately fades out of the film.  Miss Mandy and Miss Franka are excellent in their respective roles of ditzy blonde actress and deep brunette photographyer (yay for deep brunettes!!).  You will be surprized at the ending (just who will our adorable old blue eyed hero end up with, if anyone?), or maybe not, but also perhaps a bit disappointed.  I felt there could have been more, not so much as to suddenly make this light fluffy comedy take a right angle into drama, but just have a bit more substance at the end.  I wanted to get the feel for where these characters are now headed, and while the ending is neat and tidy, it's all of a sudden 'the end'.
Worth buying/renting for most of it, and it's so fun to see Elijah playing a little tonsil hockey (well, maybe ~more~ than a little)<tee hee>.  And it's great to see him growing up and maturing into an excellent actor who can play comedy and drama as an adult, act as well as react in his scenes. If you're making your Elijah library, this one makes a fun addition, while you dream up your own alternate endings in your own fantasy world.",1076457600,5,3120,4.4205933682373475
1907655,4,B0000AKCJO,"Elijah Wood is just a great actor, and Mandy Moore actually surprised me in her performance. All i want, orginally titled try 17, (based on a line betweem jones(Elijah) and Brad)is a story of a seventeen year old kid (Elijah) who rents an apartment and gets togethter with two of his neighbors. THroughout the film you learn aobut his family past and that true love can be found! the best scene is when Elijah kick's steve's ass! Go elijah! he is so HOT!",1074902400,,454,4.481927710843373
1907656,4,B0000AKCJO,"I think people read too much into this movie.  I don't see it as a coming of age story or a teeny bopper flick.  I mean let's face it, the only teeny bopper is Moore and she plays one of the older women.  Granted the story line isn't the best, but the characters are amazing.  You got a young dreamer played by Wood who is not satisfied with what the world is handing him and finally does something about it.  There is a striving actress who is not good at all and it shows in her all around character.  Then there is the mysterious photographer/artist who is a little freaky, but then a door opens into her life and we see her for what she really is.  I really don't think the fact that Wood plays a seventeen year old should be relevant.  It only says that seventeen is usually the age where your life makes its first drastic changes. I for one loved the change that Dillon and his mom had towards one another throughout the movie.",1074729600,,933,4.202247191011236
1907657,5,B0000AKCJO,"All I have to say is that Franka Potente carried this film. She became her character so well that Elijah didn't even have to try.  She is, as always, a dominant character, and it works out very well. The film is well-made, the story is good, the characters are quirky and awesome, and if nothing else, Franka Potente's acting made this film so fantastic!  I gaurentee that you will be so overcome by Franka's character, and how real she makes her, that you will want to watch this movie again and again, just so you can again witness the perfect complexity that Franka is able to pull through her character. For Franka Potente, watch this movie.",1071187200,,645,4.551724137931035
1907658,4,B0000AKCJO,"Over all, this is a very cute and entertaining movie. Elijah Wood is a 17 year-old who is out on his own in the world. He leaves college after only one day and gets an apartment where he meets two girls whom hate each other. Elijah is adorable (as usual) and you really feel for his character. Franka Potente is very good as well. While she seems crazy at first, she ends up being a very lovable character. Mandy Moore, on the other hand, was very unconvincing and had very wooden acting. I liked her in ""A Walk to Remember"" but she was just plain horrible in this. Besides her stinking up the movie, it is very lovable and I reccomend any young adult to see it.",1068854400,10,662,4.2204724409448815
1907659,4,B0000AKCJO,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. Everything else was rented out in Blockbuster, so I decided to try this one out. And I enjoyed it the whole way through.
Elijah wood plays a college drop out who has never spoken to his father but writes him a letter almost every day (that he never sends, of course). His life takes a turn when he moves into an apartment smack in the middle of Mandy Moore (A Walk to Remember, singer)and Franka Potente (Run Lola Run, Bourne Identity). Will he fall for Mandy, who is the beautiful, sexy, vivacious but not so deep blonde? Or for Franka, the cranky photographer who still has ex-boyfriend hang ups?
Elijah Wood is really a great actor. He continues to impress me as he gets better and better. And Mandy Moore was an absolute delightful surprise! I loved her in a Walk to Remember, but this is such a different role for her, yet she plays it so convincingly. This girl is going to have a great career as an actress!
It was a really entertaining movie. I recommend it.",1068336000,,1002,4.421621621621622
1907660,5,B0000AKCJO,"Being an Elijah fan I wanted to rent the movie, and I did. I thought it would be the worst thing I had seen him in. So I had low expectations for being an Elijah fan. But it was surprisingly funny at times, as well as times making you want to cry. I would defentally recoment this for Elijah fans and non Elijah fans alike!",1068249600,,323,3.9846153846153847
1907661,4,B0000AKCJO,"As a big Elijah Wood fan, this was a must-see, and one is not usually disappointed by his work. This was no exception. The film had its low points (Debi Harry) but mostly high ones (""I think you dropped this.""), and the cast was fine-tuned. I never thought I'd like a movie with Mandy Moore in it, much less Mandy Moore herself, but she's all right--she plays a bad actress very well.
My favorite part (yes, I am this shallow sometimes) is when Elijah is on the motorcycle and it stalls, and he stops and takes off his helmet and rumples his hair. The whole movie is worth it just for that one scene. (Plus, when was the last time YOU saw him shirtless?)",1067558400,,654,4.282258064516129
1907662,5,B0000AKCJO,"this movie was a sensational film !!! I loved the entire film in itself because Elijah Woods is to me one of the most incredable actors of the 21st Century . He plays such an awesome role as this 17 year old boy just trying to deal with life as a teen and a horn dog too =-) I loved the part with Deborah ""Blondie"" Harry as Ma Mabley where she tries to seduce young Elijah ( all men should be so lucky in real life to have that happen to them ) . Mandy Moore did pretty fair acting in this film and Elizabeth Perkins was great in the film as well . I would seriously recommend this film to all an A+ film in my book .",1066608000,2,617,3.7906976744186047
1907663,2,B0000AKCJO,"Rent it before you buy it.  I wish someone had given me that kind of advice before I took this plunge.  What a waste of two hours and twenty dollars.  Mandy Moore's adorable.  I love her, but although she's shown herself to be a talented actress in the projects that she's done, this performance isn't going to go down in history as one of her best, at least as far as I'm concerned.  I actually thought that her part may have been a little too overacted at times.  Franke Potente does an adequate job of portraying her character, and I did find it interesting how the conflict between the two girls unfolded.  At first, we only know that Jane (Potente) doesn't like Lisa (Moore) for some reason, and then we slowly find out why.  Now, the actor who I have my real problem with is Elijah Woods.  I don't know how old he is, but despite his age, he hasn't yet been able to lose that childlike, pre-pubescent face of his.  Not only could I not, as an earlier reviewer commented, picture him drinking and smoking, but I also had a very hard time picturing him in sexual situations with either of the leading ladies.  They possess the image of mature, grown women, and he just doesn't come off as the male equivalent.  And the ""Mrs. Robinson"" sequence with Deborah Harry was ridiculous. I know that the idea was too have a young, naive, inexperienced guy pitted against older, more worldly gals, but I'm sorry.  Where this one's concerned, I may have paid for it, but I still haven't bought it.",1066176000,6,1490,4.453874538745388
