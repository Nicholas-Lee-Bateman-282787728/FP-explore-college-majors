1674929,5,B00005Y7FO,Could somebody please tell me what the difference is between the 3 dvds listed on Amazon (other than the differences listed in the description).  They all have different ASIN numbers and different prices.  Is one better than the other?  Thank you!,1114041600,,247,4.975609756097561
1674930,5,B00005Y7FO,"I loved this DVD set.  I'm curious why the enclosed booklet was not in English.  For $50, I'd expect to be able to enjoy the info in the booklet as well, but could not.

Exceptional performances in here.  I've seen Phantom of the Opera with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, and I've seen Miss Saigon in NYC as well as Oliver in London, both starring Jonathan Pryce.  Watching this DVD, I realized how lucky I am to have seen these great musicals in NYC and London, with the orignal casts and it's exciting to own a few of the memorable performances in my own collection!",1095984000,,575,4.438095238095238
1674931,5,B00005Y7FO,"Okay, so it is pretty much the same as the VHS version, but if you like DVDs better, buy this.  The sound and picture are very good, as is the show itself.  I absolutely loved every single performance!  Some of the shows I have never seen, but I was glad that they were actually acted out instead of just having the actors standing there singing as if they were in a concert (Les Miserables the 10th Anniversary Concert, for example).  Overall, I give this 5 stars.",1061942400,17,465,4.372093023255814
1674932,5,B00005Y7FO,"No matter what your taste in musical theater, this DVD has something for you.  I was amazed at the depth and breadth of work Cameron Mackintosh has produced.  Here is a collection of the well known, e.g., Bernadette Peters singing ""Being Alive"" from Company and Elaine Paige singing ""Memory"" from CATS, and the less known, e.g., Tom Lehrer's ""Poisoning Pigeons in the Park"", from Tomfoolery.  Special favorites and highlights for me include the wonderfully talented Ellen Green singing ""Somewhere that's green"" and ""Suddenly Seymour"" from Little Shop of Horrors; Judi Dench doing a moving rendition of ""Send in the Clowns"" from A Little Night Music; David Campbell's all too brief Martin Guerre and Last Night of the World from Miss Saigon introduced me to a terrific new singer.  The orignal crew from Side By Side By Sondheim is also wonderful to experience once again.  If you like good music; fine performances; and sure fire fun, give this DVD, and also available CD, a listen and a watch.",1061424000,9,994,4.92814371257485
7956551,5,B00005Y7FO,"I've had the VHS tape for years and just loved this concert. The DVD was quite expensive for a long time and just didn't want to pay the price. When I saw this for a great price had to purchase it. The quality of the DVD  is just great. Only one draw back. The song list and mostly everything else is in Chinese. To solve that problem, I took the little booklet from the VHS tape and put it in the dvd jewel case and now I can enjoy the DVD and the song titles. Anyone who loves Broadway show tunes will love this concert.",1401408000,,522,3.9714285714285715
7956552,5,B00005Y7FO,"excellent service;  ,excellent product  recommend highly  I've watched this many times and still am in awe of the talent that abounds on this cd set.",1381708800,,149,4.88
7956553,5,B00005Y7FO,I fell in love with this program many years ago after watching it on t.v.  It has been amazing owning it on dvd and being able to watch it whenever and as often as I want!  It's one of the best compilations for the Broadway enthusiast.,1298851200,,235,4.086956521739131
7956554,5,B00005Y7FO,"Great video has alot of the best Broadway stars, starring in it. I oved the video, and if you get it you'll like it too.",1208908800,,120,3.84
7956555,5,B00005Y7FO,"Featuring songs from some 27 hit musicals and top artists (actually over 250 performers in all) from both sides of the Atlantic, this is two & a half hours of solid entertainment.  The DVD includes rare scenes, with cameo singing appearances by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Stephen Sondheim doing a duet, and arguably what is the best performance one can hear of ""Send in the Clowns"" sung by Dame Judy Dench.

It is hard to believe that this show had only two performances & the DVD is based on the second night's Royal Gala Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth.  The cast and numbers are so numerous it is worth while downloading the programme from the net, in order to identify the singers and the show!

One can watch this multiple times and find something new on each occasion.",1163289600,3,779,4.58273381294964
7956556,5,B00005Y7FO,"This musical review, which is a tribute to Cameron MacKintosh, is one of the greatest collections of music and artists from the West End or Broadway.

I thoroughly enjoy it!",1162512000,,173,4.766666666666667
7956557,5,B00005Y7FO,"I have heard so much about Judi Dench's rendition of ""Send in the Clowns"" it was lovely to finally see and hear her sing it!",1134432000,4,124,4.0
7956558,4,B00005Y7FO,"It's really nice to be able to read something about what you've purchased, but unless your fluent in many languages your out of luck....This is a fantastic collection of music since I have it on VHS & wanted a version that would last longer because I've played it so much....I was lucky enough to read another review & it solved the problem why I couldn't get any sound...Thanks to that person it explanined that I needed to select audio on my clicker to get sound...I was all ready to order another one as soon as I figured out the difference in the other 2 when I came across a review solving my problem....I am now as I type enjoying this dvd....",1117238400,4,649,4.371900826446281
7956559,4,B00005Y7FO,"For those wondering what the differences are in the several different dvds.....this one has the book in Chinese and the main menu is in Chinese.  You have to click English and, at least on my player, have to click audio button on the remote to get sound. So far  I have found no listing of who sings the various songs. The picture  and the sound quality are good and the new products section is entertaining with an ad for Riverdance partly in Chinese.",1114128000,9,452,4.421686746987952
7956560,5,B00005Y7FO,"IT IS IN CHINESE or some other ASIAN language! The MENU screens and CHAPTER TITLES are not readable! That is the only thing that chaps my ""you know what"" and there is NO MENTION of that fact when you are ordering it. I originally had the VHS version of the same title, but you know how tapes get after a while. I bought that from CIRCUIT CITY for $7.00! Now to pay $49.00+ for a version I cannot really read...c'mon! However, once you start playinf it, it all melts away and you begin to enjoy the music and theatrical numbers.",1114128000,2,527,4.28
