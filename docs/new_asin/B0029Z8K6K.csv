8358623,3,B0029Z8K6K,"I was attracted to the great collection of comics all on one DVD. I have not finished viewing it yet. I will say, these comics do not get to be themselves though. Their acts seem very to be tuned down being Montreal appears to be very conservative compared to us here in the U.S.A.",1487808000,,281,4.222222222222222

8358628,5,B0029Z8K6K,"I got this dvd because it has Mitch Hedberg.  Of course Lewis Black is always funny, and it's interesting to see a younger Jim Gaffigan (with glasses and slimmer).  It made my boyfriend and I both laugh.",1306454400,5,203,4.45945945945946
8358629,4,B0029Z8K6K,"A classic performance by Mitch Hedberg is the main reason for purchasing this DVD, but the other performers are fun to watch also.  I just wish there was more material on this wonderful comedian who left us all too soon.",1293408000,8,220,4.5
