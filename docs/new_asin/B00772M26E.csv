Great satire of all these campy dance movies and musicals, and the songs are genuinely catchy.  If ""Fame"" and ""Flashdance"" smoked crack and had a baby together, ""Freak Dance"" would be their glorious crack baby.

A must see!",1342224000,2,330,4.857142857142857
5059146,5,B00772M26E,"This movie is hilarious. It's a well made dance-musical-comedy, and I'm not a fan of musicals or dancing. I am a huge UCB fan however, and this is the best of the three UCB movies.",1341705600,,180,4.171428571428572

8511482,4,B00772M26E,Bought this when I was drunk listening to improv4humans,1461801600,,55,5.222222222222222
8511483,5,B00772M26E,If you don't have a sense of humor than this movie is not for you.,1417046400,,66,3.466666666666667
8511484,4,B00772M26E,"Not for the weak-stomached, this movie is for connoisseurs of the 1980s dance movie genre. If you weren't a wide-eyed youth when you watched ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"" for the first time, ""Freak Dance"" may not hold the same special something. Although there is a healthy dose of shout outs to ""Step Up,"" ""You Got Served"" and the like, it is ""Flashdance"" and ""Beat Street"" that this movie's roots are in. Basically, this movie is HILARIOUS!",1367625600,,444,4.855263157894737
8511485,4,B00772M26E,"This is a pretty enjoyable goofy musical, with lots of good dancing. Kind of a spoof of footloose. Full of hilarious comedians. I would have liked to see the weed fiend played by Paul Rust a little more; that character was hilarious. Unsurprisingly, the 4 funniest characters were the ones played by the seasoned UCB founders. This movie is very fun, but probably not for anyone who dislikes musicals.",1363910400,,401,4.826086956521739
8511486,4,B00772M26E,If you like dance films and musicals this comedy is for you.  It's not a straight up parody in the Dance Movie/Scary Movie sense.  Freak Dance is an actual film that happens to make frequent mention and use of many of the conventions found in most dance flicks and musicals.  Matt Besser and Amy Poehler are hilarious as always.  The dancing is very impressive for a comedy and the music is pretty dope.  If you like dancing and comedy this is a must see.,1354147200,,455,4.369047619047619
8511487,1,B00772M26E,not a very good movie actually it is a very weird movie not much more i can say about it.,1352764800,,89,3.5
8511488,1,B00772M26E,"I watched about 30 minutes of this and shut it off. I have no problem with dance movies and I love spoofs, but this was horrible. It was slow, the singing was like listening to finger nails on a chalkboard. Dance Flick was funny, imagine Dance Flick without actual comedy and singing most of the dialogue. Gross, gross, gross and horribly stupid. F this.",1346803200,,354,4.546875
8511489,5,B00772M26E,"It is no ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" but it is a movie by the delightful Matt Besser. Show some love for the CBB - UCB - ODB homeboy and boy/rent/view his movie. It is better to live in a world where Matt Besser works hard than a world where he does the opposite.",1343520000,,260,3.9245283018867925
