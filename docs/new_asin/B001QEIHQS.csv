8335467,5,B001QEIHQS,My grand baby loves this dvd glad that I got it.,1452729600,,48,3.4545454545454546
8335468,1,B001QEIHQS,Not very Hip or Hop! The songs and dance moves need to be more in line with what kids hear on the radio. The songs were unfamiliar to a one year old and the dance moves were hoke!,1420416000,,179,3.736842105263158
8335469,2,B001QEIHQS,Good content but its a bit more dated than I had expected.,1412553600,,58,3.9166666666666665
8335470,5,B001QEIHQS,"A great video for kids, especially those who already like to dance and are very active.",1270684800,,87,4.5
8335471,3,B001QEIHQS,"Just buy one of this series.  This one is not as good as Hip Hip Favorites which my kids ages 2,2,1 adore and I gave a 5 star rating. Also be aware this is not really hip hop. Just has a little boom box bass. There is a lady on this video who tries to teach one little hip hop dance - it is pretty awful. The songs aren't as good as hip hop favorites either.  Still all that said the kids do like it.  Hip Hop favorites has 3 of the same songs as this one.  I really wouldn't buy both dvd's.  One will drive you crazy enough since the want to watch it every day.",1255996800,3,562,3.769230769230769
8335472,5,B001QEIHQS,"My son loves this and I love that he can learn and see a diverse group of children. We're a white family who hv adopted a mixed son. Growing up n LA it was easy to integrate w/ other cultures. Tougher to provide that in IN. so @ 21 months we're already looking for ways to provide that (church, books, play dates, socially, childcare,etc).This provided fun learning AND the cultural mix we're always looking for.",1250467200,,412,4.506666666666667
8335473,5,B001QEIHQS,This is one of my daughter's favorite DVDs. It's a perfect gift to encourage learning and being active. The music is great for dancing and singing! I highly recommend it to anyone with a toddler or with a toddler relative!,1240876800,,222,4.575
8335474,5,B001QEIHQS,"We got an advance copy of It's Hip Hop Baby and my daughter is addicted. The music is catchy for her and not annoying for me. She dances and jumps around with the kids; she even demands it sometimes when she's in a dance party kind of mood. We don't always have the time to attend a playgroup or have playdates with other kids. This video is perfect for those time strapped days when I've run out of ideas on things to do and  we can't make it to play with other kids.

I also have to mention that we're a family that limits TV. I'm not a fan of plopping my daughter down in front of the TV set and letting her get hypnotized. We allow about an hour, if that, a day.  This video is so interactive for her that I don't mind at all having her watch it. She doesn't want to sit for a second when this is one.  And me or my husband always join in the fun with her because you just can't help yourself!

I know there are several more videos coming out and we'll definitely be adding them to our collection.  I highly recommend it!",1237161600,3,1025,4.024630541871921
