8643698,1,B00INMLXSU,"I tried this DVD because the only Globe Trekker DVD for the Phillipines seemed overpriced at $16 plus shipping, was hosted by a host I did not know from the Globe Trekker series and only rec'd 2 1/2 stars on reviews.  After years of enjoying Globe Trekker and becoming familiar with their DVD's and the great quality of the music and photography as well as the many excellent hosts - Ian Wright being my personal favorite - I was in great hopes that possibly another travel DVD might in some way remind me of what I had become accustomed to.  I could NOT have possibly been more wrong!  I started the DVD and immediately noticed that I'm watching a series of photographs - yes pictures - not video - of this older couple who apparently had a vacation on the Phillipines.  I did not pay $15 dollars to watch 1 1/2 hours of a couple sharing their vacation photos with me!! This is an affront to anyone who enjoys quality travel DVD's as Globe Trekker fans surely know.  I'm hoping I can sell this useless trash to some unsuspecting or undiscerning individual CHEAP - maybe I give it away.  Want a free DVD?  Pay shipping only?",1418428800,,1124,4.427184466019417
