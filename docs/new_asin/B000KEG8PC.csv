2688626,4,B000KEG8PC,"ZOMG, what were they thinking. No hate for the guys calling the review, but Toby and Jules would have been a far superior choice for this review. 2009 was ok, maybe not as good as other seasons... But no Toby == -1 star. 4 Stars because I want the guys at Dorna to put out more media, good media. MotoGP Rocks. I would rate this a 3.5/5.0 or a solid C.",1264723200,,352,3.971830985915493
2688627,5,B000KEG8PC,"2009 WAS AN AWESOME YEAR! QUITE POSSIBLY MY FAVORITE TO DATE! THE LEGEND ROSSI AND THE PRODIGY LORENZO IN HIS 2ND YEAR GO AT IT NON STOP! GURANTEED FOOTAGE THAT WILL HAVE YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. THE PREMIER CLASS HAS 4 RIDERS IN PEDROSA, STONER, ROSSI, AND LORENZO THAT ARE SO RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED THAT THEY ARE IN A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN. I RECCOMEND THIS DVD TO COLIN EDWARDS FANS ASWELL AS HE TAKES THE HIGHEST POSITION OF ANY SATELITE RIDER AND HAS HIS OWN DUEL WITH ANDREA DOVIZIOSO. THE POINTS WERE CLOSE IN THE TOP 10 THE WHOLE SEASON AND A FEW RIDERS WERE IN A POSITION OF LOSING THEIR RIDES WHICH MADE FOR MORE GOOD COMPETITION. THE ONLY THING THAT I FOUND TO BE DISAPOINTING WAS THE LACK OF FOOTAGE FOR THE BEST RACE I HAVE EVER SEEN, THE BATTLE OF BARCELONA AT CATALUNYA, THIS RACE WAS SICK, AND LITERALLY CAME DOWN TO THE LAST CORNER AND THERE WERE PARTS MISSING. OVERALL THOUGH FOR THE PRICE, THE FACT THAT YOU CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER, AND FOR THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION IT IS DEFINETLY WORTH 5 STARS. JUST A HEADS UP BE ON THE LOOK OUT NEXT YEAR, SHORE THERES ALOT OF RULE CHANGES WHICH COULD DO MORE BAD THAN GOOD BUT THE PREMIER CLASS COULD POSSIBLY BE THE DEEPEST IN TERMS OF TALENT THAT IT EVER HAS BEEN! WATCH OUT FOR BEN SPIES...

PS. HAHA CHECK OUT STONERS HIGHSIDE ON THE WARMUP LAP IN THE LAST RACE, WHAT A CLOWN",1264636800,2,1341,4.217898832684825
2688628,3,B000KEG8PC,"The video quality is so-so (hard to distinguish riders in longshots), and I can't complain about the editing, which seems to have gotten the important parts (though not the post-race interviews for the podium finishers).

What makes this a 3-star video instead of 4- or 5-stars is Nick Harris, one of the commentators -- Captain Obvious at 120db. Imagine someone doing a blow-by-blow of you tying your shoelaces while screaming in your ear, and you get the idea. It would be a wonderful feature in future DVDs to have a commentary-free soundtrack; just the sounds of the bikes and the info on the screen would be much better than Hysterical Harris.",1264204800,,648,4.837837837837838
2688629,5,B000KEG8PC,"Wow, what a year in MotoGP! Not only were there new faces joining the circuit, many of the new riders gave it their all from day one. It was great to see how the season unfolded between Casey Stoner, Dani Pedrosa, Vale and Lorenzo. The battles between Vale and Lorenzo were classic and it was great to see the Doctor come out on top this past season but look for an even better 2010 season. I wish the disc would include more extras, behind-the-scenes and post race interviews which always seems to be cut off by the Speed Network. Oh well, at least I have access to MotoGP races online, eh?",1263427200,2,591,4.333333333333333
2688630,5,B000KEG8PC,"THIS YEAR MARKS ROSSIS 4TH AND FINAL WITH HONDA. WATCH AS ROSSI PLAYS WITH THE RC211V LIKE A TOY, DELIVERS SOME GARY MCCOY LIKE SLIDES AND SHOWS US JUST WHY HE IS THE BEST! THIS YEAR ALSO FEATURES DUCATIS 1ST IN THE PREMIER CLASS AND LORRIS CAPIROSSI RIDES THE DEMOSCEDICI LIKE A COWBOY.2003 WAS BACK WHEN THEY WERE ALOWED 990CC ENGINES AND THIS YEAR THE HP WAS UPD BY ABOUT 40 RESULTING IN SOME BRUTAL CRASHES, ONE OF WHICH SADLY TOOK FORMER 250 CHAMP DAIJIRO KATOS LIFE.THIS ALSO IS COLLIN EDWARDS, NICKY HAYDEN, TROY BAYLISS, AND MARCO MELANDRIS ROOKIE SEASONS.OTHER NOTABLE RIDERS(ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ALL SUPERSTARS) ARE SETE GIBERNAU(WHO PROVES TO BE A TOUGH OPPONENT FOR ROSSI ON OCCASION) AND OFCOURSE MAX BIAGGI. THE DOWNSIDE IS FOR SOME REASON THEY DECIDED TO TAKE THE APROACH OF BROADCASTING THE RACES AS IF IT WERE ON THE NEWS INSTEAD OF COMENTATING AS IF THEY WERE LIVE. IF YOU'RE LIKE ME THOUGH YOU WILL WATCH THIS DVD OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT WILL SOON FADE.FEATURES INCLUDE NEWS OFF TRACK, ONBOARD LAPS, AND SOME EXTRAS INCLUDING A SHORT HIGHLIGHT REEL WITH GARY MCCOY DOING ONE OF THE SICKEST SLIDES TO DATE. ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY SHOULD INCLUDE A FEATURE ON THE MENU WHERE YOU CAN MUTE THE COMENTATORS I STILL GIVE THIS DVD A 5 STAR RATING, IT'S CHEAP AND GIVES US THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RACING IN THE WORLD, AND YOU CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER.",1258070400,,1359,4.551020408163265
2688631,1,B000KEG8PC,"Over twenty bucks for 62 minutes of disjointed coverage. For each of these battles, which went on for years, you get fifteen to twenty minutes of interviews played over clips of the riders and the racing. Very very short clips, two seconds here, five seconds there. Many of them are things like photo ops and slow motion of one of the guys sitting there doing nothing. What a RIP OFF!!! I watched many of these races live and I hoped they'd at least show a representative bit of racing between each of the pairs, but they never show enough of even one lap to give you an idea of how these guys actually compared. My impression from watching Mick and Alex every year, every race, was that Alex only won when he ambushed Mich and once Mick was on to his technique that didn't happen again. Mick even complained about it after the first time he did it. Not mentioned in this video.

Do yourself a favor, buy a Duke video instead, much better value and much better made.",1187049600,3,966,4.396648044692737
2688632,5,B000KEG8PC,One of the best MotoGP DVD's out there.  I've watched it 3 times already.  Very good insite into each racers history.,1172102400,,117,4.523809523809524
2688633,2,B000KEG8PC,"It looks  like the marketing boys that control the motogp organization  were looking for a way to make some extra money for the coming 2007 season and the start of 800cc premiere class by dreaming up this silly  excuse of a dvd, the racing footage was mediorce and the context of the rivalry insipid. Nice seeing the two-stroke 500cc bikes!",1170892800,2,340,4.633333333333334

8155791,4,B000KEG8PC,Motogp 2009 book is a very nice book with good pictures. If you are into motorcycles and racing this would be a great book for you or a gift. Can't be amazon's prices compared to retail prices.,1340150400,,193,4.243243243243243

8155793,5,B000KEG8PC,"Another great year in MotoGP, Rossi dominated and showed why he's a 9 time champion, even battling the considerable skills of Stoner, Lorenzo, Pedrosa and the rest of the best. I wouldn't mind watching every minute of every race, but I know that this a review, a complete DVD of every race. With that said, they showed every highlight and critical movment of every race.",1291334400,,370,4.707692307692308
8155794,4,B000KEG8PC,The program always shows just short clips of the season. I understand there is limited space on a DVD yet they do a  pretty fair job when providing a synopsis of the season. Yet it would be awesome to ride a lap with the pole setter and rarely do they identify the pilot on the lap that is provided on the DVD. I can make a guess to the characteristics of the engine. Please provide the pole lap on the DVD. It would be neat to know that the lap the public sees IS the fastest lap of the year! Just my opinion ; ),1276905600,,513,3.8857142857142857
