7913628,4,B00000JWGN,"This movie is about an alien fungus that can mimic any human female it touches. The fungus is brought aboard a space ship that is doing scientific research and while the sexy female asian scientist examins it the fungus shoots a kind of myst at her. The myst gets the sexy scientist turned on and she starts to masturbate,and while this is happening the fungus creates a copy of her and quickly has sex with the rest of the ships crew. After the alien female is captured it quickly escapes the area 51 type facility and the fbi agents on the case learn that the last person to have sex with the alien has a mental link with it. Kira Reed plays the lead role of the female fbi agent on the case and she,her male partner and a few sexy women go on the hunt for the filthy minded alien. This movie is not only hot but is also very funny in the way it spoofs the X-Files. There have been many Adult movies that spoof pop culture but most of them just seem stupid but this movie does it well because it doesn't take itself too seriously. There are a lot of good sex scenes in this thing as well as many beautiful women such as Kira Reed,Gabriella Hall and the most beautiful woman on the planet Kim Yates(she plays the female alien at the end).If you're gonna get one sexy alien movie your whole life get this one. Just make sure you get the UNRATED version of this movie because the R-rated version has all the sex taken out just like all R-rated softcore movies. If your gonna buy softcore movies ALWAYS GET UNRATED VERSION!",1186704000,,1521,4.284722222222222
7913629,2,B00000JWGN,"I bought this film and I was dissapointed.  I mean, yes, the women are beautiful, but the film itself is a dud.  I'd like to say this is a good R rated movie, but I can't; while the sex scenes aren't much beyond an R movie, the storyline sucks.  Don't get me wrong, I think this movie has a lot of potential; an alien fungus that takes the form of women, (I'm glad they didn't have it attack men, because I don't want to see that) but that's where the good idea stops.  This sex crazed alien starts having less than belivable sex with many men it goes by.

  I think it should have more (and better) girl girl sex than the one feeling/rubbing scene it has.

I think the title of the review is the best way to put it.",1132704000,2,716,4.028368794326241
7913630,4,B00000JWGN,"During the opening credits one realizes that ""Alien Files"" is not really the title of this film.  The real title has been edited over (I don't know if they were in conflict with a certain television series or a series of books from England).  Two FBI agents have been brought in when a space mission returns from a tragic journey.

The astronauts encountered some space fungus and then were seduced by a shapechanging alien.  Only one of the crew has managed to escape.  But soon the agents find themselves chasing the alien across the country.  They also learn a shocking secret about an earlier space mission.

Lots of sex fills out this erotic parody of a popular show.  The story is good enough to stand separately from the sex and that is unusual.  There si even mention of a coming sequel so if you like this one you might be able to see more.  If you like erotic films with a good story backing it up you will probably like this one.",1093564800,10,940,4.412790697674419
7913631,4,B00000JWGN,"OK, so it's NOT ""Lord of the Rings"".  The acting is good, the people interesting, the naked bodies good to look upon, and everybody involved in the film seems to be having fun.  I got exactly what I expected: a decent story, decently acted, and some utterly gorgeous undraped female eye candy, all of whom actually did some acting.
This one was a good hearted parody of the ""X-files"", and it's going into my permanent collection so when I'm in the mood for some good, well-filmed eye candy, it will be there.",1028246400,9,508,4.510869565217392
7913632,3,B00000JWGN,"It's not Citizen Kane, but I'm sure you know that going in. That aside, Alien Files is enjoyable and highly erotic, featuring numerous lesbian scenes, love scenes, and lots of attractive women writhing and convulsing in ecstasy.
  The plot concerns an sexually charged alien virus that clones every woman it infects.  The clone seduces and makes love to as many people as it can, while the original girl, telepathically linked to the clone, spends most of her time squirming around and moaning. Its silly, but its all just an excuse to see a bunch of sex scenes intercut with the same actress, alone in a room somewhere, flopping and writhing around on the floor, half naked. And there alot of them. In fact, every actress in this movie has to perform some sort of gratuitous writhing act. Auditions must have been interesting.
  All of this occurs in the unrated version. The r-rated version was butchered heavily, much of the sex, and just about all of the writhing gone.",1005609600,9,973,4.767857142857143
7913633,5,B00000JWGN,"This was an excellent movie. It was full of gratuitous sex with voluptuous vixens. Kira Reed should win the oscar for best ""bent over wet look"". I would like to thank the producers for abstaining from the  super silcone, collagen lipped, tattoo tramps that seem to permeate the  soft core scene. The film also utilized the many assets of the ladies to  create a believable, yet fantastical feature. This allowed the ladies to  exhibit all facets of their characters, and the audience to explore the  many nuances of each scenario. Will you enjoy it? That's like you're  drawers, it's up to ya. But rest assured if Kira makes a sequel, I'll be on  it like a jelly doughnut.",949363200,5,672,4.6440677966101696
