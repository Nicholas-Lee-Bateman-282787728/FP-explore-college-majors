6248234,1,B00I3KU16C,Good but kind of a strange movie.,1425081600,,33,3.857142857142857
6248235,3,B00I3KU16C,"Kind of interesting, showing how God can provide in the most difficult situations.",1423094400,,82,5.384615384615385
6248236,2,B00I3KU16C,Very slow moving and not really much of a story.  Not something I would watch again.,1414627200,,84,4.25
6248237,4,B00I3KU16C,"This movie was slow in some spots, and is different from the normal ""coming-to-Jesus"" story, but it's a really good, inspirational story of a young woman's suffering, perseverance, and ultimate survival and victory.",1413763200,,215,5.545454545454546
6248238,4,B00I3KU16C,"Watched this movie on Netflix and enjoyed it, but just like ""All Is Lost"", I was left wondering if the character survived or not. Watched the end again and it could go both ways.",1411516800,,178,4.264705882352941
6248239,5,B00I3KU16C,"Great film. A little slow in parts, but it held my attention to the final surprise ending!",1410480000,,90,4.352941176470588
6248240,4,B00I3KU16C,"Jasmin Jandreau is captivating in her portrayal of Amelia. A large portion of the film takes place without dialogue, and Jandreau has little to play against beyond the landscape. Still, she manages to come across as both innocent and independent, fragile and strong, fearful and brave. While the film immediately grabs your attention by placing you squarely into Amelias peril, it would have been nice to have had more opportunity to know Amelia as she was before her journey. This would have allowed us to see how she grows and changes, and ultimately, to care even more for her plight.

Tommy Nash appears only briefly as Levi. But his presence is disturbingly palpable. Levi is nothing short of mad with gold fever. I guess a man had to be a little crazy to risk everything on rumors of gold. But, again, a little context might have helped us understand Levis desperation. Instead, you get the feeling that hes domineering, bordering on abusive. After his death, Amelia often looks at his picture lovingly and longingly, but without having seen a tender moment exchanged between the two, its hard to understand the weight of her loss.

Amelias battle for survival gains and sustains your attention throughout. Thematically, the film aims to illustrate how Amelia nearly loses her faith in God before rediscovering and strengthening it. When she buries Eli, the words of First Corinthians 13 fail to bring her comfort. And when she later prays, asking God for a sign, she feels abandoned. So, asking forgiveness, she buries her Bible. Eventually, circumstances help her to see that God never left her, He was always at her side. When Amelia discovers this, she makes a little speech professing that God isn't just in the Bible or in church, He is everywhere. And nature, His Creation, she realizes, is the most beautiful church imaginable.

While these are valuable lessons, I wanted a bit more depth. I would have liked to see how Amelia was able to make the journey from losing belief to gaining a deeper faith and understanding.

All things considered,Let Godwill find favor with viewers looking for an inspirational story of a young woman overcoming great odds and trials through faith. And perhapsLet Godwill bring viewers assurance that, with trust in Him, their personal struggles are not insurmountable.

Verdict: 3.5 of 5 stars. If you like historical films, and prefer simple, plain-clothes movies to high-budget, high-tech blockbusters, youll find something inspiring and uplifting inLet God.

Lead actress Jasmin Jandreaus talented performance will leave a lasting impression.

6248241,5,B00I3KU16C,"Amelia is a housewife of the mid 1800's who finds herself alone and struggling to survive in the wilderness on a trip gone awry with her husband to California's gold rush.  Amelia finds herself fighting the cold, isolation, and thoughts of giving up while lost.  In her desperate attempts to stay alive she prays out to God for deliverance from her situation.

I'm always looking for obscure Christian movies and this one is definitely a gem.  I found the entire movie captivating from beginning to end.  I'm well aware of the problems that plague Christian movies, bad acting, bad screenwriting, bad special effects, etc., but this movie seems to contain none of these problems.  There's a twist at the end of the movie that kept me thinking about the movie all throughout the next day at work so much so that I had to watch it again the following evening.

Overall, this movie was well acted, well written, and will inspire you to watch over and over again!",1398988800,7,959,4.6726190476190474

8638697,5,B00I3KU16C,Loved this movie. Fascinating what it would have been like to travel across the USA 150 years ago. I also read a novel by Sandra Dallas true sisters that gave detail about a journey across the USA that I would recommend,1458259200,,219,4.365853658536586
8638698,1,B00I3KU16C,This is the worst low budget film I have seen in a while. I will not save and watch again. I will see if I can trade at Movie Trading Co. Bad to the core.,1455148800,,154,3.4285714285714284
8638699,1,B00I3KU16C,"I was astonished at the message within the movie. As a Christian, my use of the bible as a guide in this world is paramount. The protagonist choice to disregard the importance of the book central to our faith and bury it in the snow as thought it were dead and of no use is a message I would not want placed I the minds of anyone. This is a poor choice by her, a poor choice by the director, and a poor choice by anyone claiming Christ as Lord. Because of this, I view this film as propaganda pushing the agenda to minimize the Word of God, the Most foolish  Poor Choice.",1448409600,4,571,4.053097345132743
