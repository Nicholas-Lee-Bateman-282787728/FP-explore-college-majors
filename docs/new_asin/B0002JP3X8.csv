All the kids are already saved, but I KNEW it would inspire them big time. Jesus Christ is one amazing and true God. Known him since I was 8. ...has helped me through the roughest places that I made messes for myself, and he has kept all the kids through the years 21-35 currently:)Never turning back:) I am never turning back. I found the right way and the meaning of this whole boot camp life!!!!!!! :) :)",1435276800,,555,4.226415094339623

8028296,5,B0002JP3X8,"I saw this on PAX and was amazed. A lot of people saw The Passion of the Christ and this documentary has a lot of real miracles that happened to people who saw it. I loved the story of the little girl who drowned and came back to life, and the guy in New York who hated god. It makes me think about what God can do in this messed up world. It's really amazing.",1093910400,20,360,3.8133333333333335
