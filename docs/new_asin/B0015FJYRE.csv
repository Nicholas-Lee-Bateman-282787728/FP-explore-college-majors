3144296,4,B0015FJYRE,"The virtual reconstruction of Hitler's bunker by Christoph Neubauer is just impressive. The thing that struck me is how modern the whole thing looked. Keep in mind the fact that the construction started in 1935, just two years after the Nazis seized the power in Germany. They started the bunker underneath the dining room of the Old Chancellery since the New Chancellery was to be builded only in 1939. It was pretty much finished in 1942, just in time to face the massive Allied air attacks. Too bad this
visual was not available in 2004 when Oliver Hirschbiegel made his film ""Downfall""(Der untergang in german)describing the final 12 days spent by Hitler in his bunker. The setting of the dictator's last hideaway would had been more accurate to reality. Since the real bunker was to be destroyed in 1989, this is your only chance to see what it looked like.",1245024000,10,862,4.753333333333333

This is a ""virtual computer generated tour"" of the Berlin Bunker that is part of the Reich Chancellery in Nazi Berlin in 1935-1942. The tour can be in ENGLISH or GERMAN and the narrator speaks very good English. Hitler has plans and war is his hidden agenda. He includes a huge bunker under the ""Winter Garden"" / Greeting room of the Reich Chancellery. The tour shows where Hitler's apartments are and how he would get to the BUNKER. It shows the before and after virtual building of the bunker. There are 3 D and 2 D images. Also is an explanation of the ""quick"" access of Hitler running to get to the BUNKER during an air raid. You have to like and enjoy World War 2 to like this DVD. It is well done. There is a follow up DVD about the Bunker from 1943 to 1945. Also mentioned about how they gained information about the bunker since few photos exist is from architectural drawings and East German Police secret files on dimensions  of the Bunker. 4 STARS~",1487980800,,1032,4.455026455026455

The drawings and photos you've seen really don't tell the story. Here you virtually walk through the bunker where Hitler made his last stand.

8258223,5,B0015FJYRE,"The graphics were excellent,colour and clarity. The audio description was clear and interesting. You felt as if you actually were in the bunker. I was sorry that the dvd only covered the Vorbunker up to 1942,and not the Fuhrer bunker itself. I hope this will be produced at a later date.",1330646400,,287,4.647058823529412
8258224,5,B0015FJYRE,"The first 40 minutes of this presentation cover the design, planning and construction of the bunker in the grounds of the Reich Chancellery. This is followed by a 10 minute tour of the interior of the bunker itself.
Visually it is absolutely stunning. I couldn't believe the level of detail. The shadowing from both artificial and natural light sources is particularly impressive. I noticed some corrosion and paint blistering around the base of one of the Chancellery columns. I also saw there was even some reverse pile shading on the carpets. As we tour the exterior of the Chancellery we can hear birdsong, but instead of using just one generic bird there are at least two or three different ones including a cuckoo. Plus you can hear crickets chirping in the evening, water from the fountain and you can see the trees swaying in the breeze. Although the primary function of the DVD is to be informative, visually it is a work of art and it is clear a lot of effort has gone into it.
The visuals are more than matched by the wealth of information provided in the narration, so much so in fact that ideally it could have done with an accompanying book. Although 50 minutes doesn't sound very long, anyone seriously interested in this subject would need to pause it every few seconds to take notes, such is the level of detail.
There are no subtitles and you get a choice of two languages; either english or german. I like the fact that whichever you choose the narration is delivered by the same person, (Joachim Schoenfeld).
I have only one criticism; that after putting so much effort and attention to detail into the presentation itself, they have then designed the worst and most frustrating, user unfriendly menu I have ever encountered. It took me about 15 minutes just to set it up before I could start watching.
Some people may be unaware that the producers have released a second DVD which covers the modifications and extensions that were carried out to the bunker in 1943.
A highly recommended series.",1328918400,6,2015,4.711048158640226
