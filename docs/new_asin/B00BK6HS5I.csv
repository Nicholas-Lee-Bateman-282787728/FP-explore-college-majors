Pascal Charbonneau is extraordinary. I've come to be happy with just one outstanding singer. Expecting a full cast of the extraordinary seems to be too much. The whole disc is worth it just to see this guy.",1408752000,,271,4.645833333333333
8569839,4,B00BK6HS5I,"I saw this production at BAM, and cried my eyes out. It really is a beautiful & heart-breaking story, both for the two young lovers, and also for the aged paranoid conqueror. It's not simple, by any means, and the minimal production just helps me to focus on the gorgeous orchestration plus the fantastic singing. However, the camera moves around too damn much, there are way too many zoom-ins and far too many zoom-outs, it's really not necessary since the stage is itself a living thing, adjusting to every bit of drama -- so with all the unnecessary camera movements it really becomes distracting & disorienting. Also, there are some distasteful ""special effects"" that should have never been allowed, since this is not a science fiction movie, it should have just been a simple & faithful filming of what was pretty much the most memorable experience I've had in years.",1372809600,10,872,4.82
8569840,5,B00BK6HS5I,"This is an incredibly poignant love story set to incredibly beautiful music, which overwhelms any infelicities of the production, which at times was inexplicable (at least to my eyes), but the singers are all fabulous, the orchestra sounds great and the opera itself is pretty short (under two hours).  The New York Times review of the performance of this production at BAM noted how explicitly homoerotic the libretto is and referred to Charpentier as a hitherto unknown pioneer for gay visibility, so if you can't handle men kissing, you shouldn't buy this DVD (even though Jonathan is actually sung by a woman, she's very credibly dressed and made-up as a young man, possibly still a teenager).  I cannot recommend this piece highly enough.",1369267200,12,743,5.032520325203252
8569841,1,B00BK6HS5I,"another Low budget thing! horrible film work rather just hear this and immagine the theater of Versailles with the Proper can i say PROPER costumes and sets!!! this should be done with!!!!

the hateful way of the world to create a pantomime of what realy was film it in a baroque theater and with proper costumes and you would have a sale this is now worth the money charged if i wanted to see this i would attend a modern theater production of a modern play. where are the battle scenes proper costumes proper make up wigs to correctly portray the TRUE essence of the Baroque and this work washed out as all euro trash preformaces are . Mr Christie is a very wonderful and marvelous man and extremley creative it is a shame to see his fabulous work crucified to the altar of modernism that is EUROTRASH!!!!!!!!!",1368489600,11,812,4.486486486486487
8569842,3,B00BK6HS5I,"I'm going to recommend this DVD solely on the grounds that it's apparently the only existing recording of an amazing and engaging production, beautifully sung and presented.

Sadly, however, you don't get a genuine idea of how amazing the production really is from this DVD, which is horribly shot and edited.  Two of the most powerful scenes between David and Jonathas are all but ruined by inexplicable editing gaffes (in the first) and cheesy and unnecessary slow-motion (in the second).  The scene where Saul consults the Witch of Endor, the highlight of the opera in the live production, is filmed and edited in such a way that it's difficult to get a sense of how the scene is arranged and the disturbing effectiveness is largely lost.

The DVD I have is a pre-release version sold at BAM during the production's run in New York.  I suppose I can always hold out hope that the commercial release was re-edited and the worst of the damage mitigated, but I'm not holding my breath.  Buy it anyway, because it will at least give you a vague idea of what this remarkable production looked like, but be prepared to cringe a lot.  And watch the final scene on YouTube, where it's presented without the clumsy special-effects distractions.",1366848000,24,1238,4.784037558685446
8569843,5,B00BK6HS5I,"Marc-Antoine Charpentier worked for many years in the shadow of the officially appointed court composer Jean-Baptiste Lully and it seems he has remained in his shadow ever since, largely overlooked even as French Baroque music is being rediscovered in modern times with Lully and his successor Rameau being favoured over Charpentier, Campra and the underrated Gossec. There may be genuine musicological reasons for this choice but judging by this rare performance of Charpentier's David et Jonathas for the 2012 Aix-en-Provence Festival - the first staged performance of the work in over 300 years - the problem seems to lie with the difficulty of adapting this kind of work for a modern stage, since musically it really is something of a delight.

First performed in 1688, a year after the death of Lully, David et Jonathas, a ""Biblical tragedy in five acts with a prologue"" is based on the friendship between David - slayer of Goliath - and Jonathas, son of King Saul. The difficulty with adapting this work to a stage production is similar to the nature of attempting to stage Handel's religious oratorios, the libretto by Pre Franois de Paule Bretonneau in this case making it somewhat difficult to grasp a clear dramatic or narrative thread. Another reason why the work may be difficult to follow was that it was originally written to be performed as musical interludes inserted into a performance of the theatrical drama Saul. The Aix production does its best to create some dramatic situations out of this Biblical story by adding flashback scenes during what would have been musical ballet sequences to fill out the background of the characters as well as the historical conflicts that have shaped them.

The Aix production also notionally sets this staging of the opera during the Palestinian Civil War and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.  The stage design rather places the action within a box of bare wood panelling, sparsely decorated with nothing more than wooden chairs and a long table, the walls and ceilings move to compress the space, open it out or split it into several rooms, blocking and boxing in to create a dramatic focus and tension to the singing. The impression given is that it's simply trying to make the staging visually more interesting and dramatic than it might otherwise be.  It's hardly necessary, since the singing itself is more than capable of finding the right dramatic tone, and if anything the staging tends to over-emphasise it and place it at odds with the often delicate elegance of Charpentier's beautiful musical arrangements and joyous choruses.

The production sparks into life during those magnificent choral arrangements, celebrating David's successes in battle, and there are many of those. Combined with Charpentier's beautiful use of melody and his use of woodwind instruments - evocatively brought out by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants (who incidentally, take their name from a Charpentier opera) - this is simply ravishingly beautiful music.  As David, Pascal Charbonneau has a powerful presence and voice, wonderfully expressive in a way that gives genuine character to the role, but it does tend to sound slightly constricted and nasal on those more stretched emotional sections, and this is a tragedy where the despairing cry of 'Hlas!' features heavily. The acoustics of the boxed stage probably don't help here either.

Elsewhere the singing and dramatic performances were excellent, even if the true quality of Ana Quintans singing only really comes through in the very moving final act death scene of Jonathas. Neal Davies sings Saul with force and passion, but the stage direction and imagery used to convey his descent into paranoia suspicion and grief isn't always convincing. David et Jonathas is clearly an extremely difficult work to adapt dramatically to the modern stage, but this is a welcome DVD release for a production that gives due musical and dramatic consideration to a true rarity from a neglected composer.",1365984000,23,3996,5.119631901840491
