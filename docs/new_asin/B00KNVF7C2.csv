8660335,3,B00KNVF7C2,"I ordered this B - level film for a very personal reason: my late mother was 1 of the gym students who dance in it. She told me the name of the film but she had never seen it. How wonderful I could get a DVD via Amazon. I was actually able to recognize my mother in the middle row, 4th girl back. Film was somewhat interesting but I can't imagine wanting to watch it often.",1504051200,,373,3.9210526315789473
