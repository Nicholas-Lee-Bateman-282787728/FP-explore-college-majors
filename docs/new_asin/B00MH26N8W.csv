6577562,4,B00MH26N8W,This six pack of movies are probably one of the best multi pack of movies I own. Personally I really enjoyed them. There b movies but I don't care. I watch movies for entertainment not how much money was spent on making them or how many awards they'll win. If you like b movies then definitely pick this up. Some movies are better than others but to me none of them sucked. I hate writing reviews on movies because people have different tastes but only one review on this pack deserved better. It's definitely one of the better multi packs.,1438646400,6,540,4.41
6577563,5,B00MH26N8W,"OK, yet another review of a Mill Creek Entertainment Multi-Pack by the guy who enjoys the Mill Creek Entertainment products.  With that said, for those of you who DO NOT enjoy low grade B to Z rate Movies, DO NOT read this review!  For those of you who happen to like these type of films, please continue to read this review.
  This is a 6 movie Multi-Pack from Mill Creek Entertainment.  They are Very Well known for their budget minded multi-packs.  And yes I own a number of them.  And yes I enjoy most of these.  ""Where Evil Lies"" Multi-Pack is no exception.  All 6 of these films in this multi-pack were made/released between 2005 and 2008.
  It contains the following 6 films:
  1) Devour (2005)
  2) Population 436 (2006)
  3) Candy Stripers (2006)
  4) Incubus (2006)
  5) Wind Chill (2008)
  6) The Cottage (2008)
  I will say that these are horribly entertaining.  I do enjoy my cheese!!!!!  So if you like this kind of fare (as I do) & are a bit selective on the type of B to Z rate fare that you watch, this is the type of film collection to have.",1423180800,12,1059,4.297435897435897
