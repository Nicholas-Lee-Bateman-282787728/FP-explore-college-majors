2388830,5,B000AGTPWI,"Amazon has posted the contents of the 3 individual DVDs that comprise this set, but they haven't duplicated that information here so I will.  This set will contain the following episodes:

""The Zillion Dollar Combo"", ""Good Neighbor"", ""The Wild Goat"", ""Big Apple"", ""Ready or Not"", ""Kum Ba Ya"", ""Officer Bob"", ""The Runaway"", ""Lemonade Stand"", ""Bully Up A Tree"", ""Doghouse Dreamhouse"", ""Jeep In The Deep"", ""A Diller A Dollar"", ""Boy In Trouble"", ""Who, Me?"", ""Who's George?"", ""Rags and Buttons"" and ""The Dog Show"", as well as the 3 aforementioned holiday specials: ""Halloween Who-Dun-It"", ""Christmas Lost and Found"", and ""New Year Promise"".

Quite a lot of episodes for the money, definitely a good deal.",1128470400,30,699,5.223214285714286
2388831,5,B000AGTPWI,"This item is set to release 10/18/2005.  But also scheduled to release in October/November, 2005 are Volumes 2, 3, and 4.  What isn't clear so far, is that the Holiday Spectacular IS Volumes 2, 3, and 4 in one package, according to the distributor's website: Starlight Home Entertainment.  So save your money and just buy this one 3 disk set.  You get 18 15-minute episodes, plus three 30-minute Holiday-themed episodes (Halloween, Christmas, New Years) for a total of 6 hours of viewing.",1125532800,43,488,4.914634146341464

8078470,2,B000AGTPWI,"Was disappointed with this set as it is NOT the older version that sticks to the Faith like I would have expected, since this is a faith based show. From a Christian point of view aka The Bible, one of the shows bring in an all religions as a way to God rather than a relationship. You'd have to see if it comes across the same to you.",1417651200,,335,3.9411764705882355

8078473,1,B000AGTPWI,"Considering that you can get volumes 1 - 6 for about the same price then I'd say that this is most definitely NOT the collection to get. This set only includes volumes 2,3 and 4 which significantly include NO HOLIDAY episodes! Save your money and get the volume 1 - 6 pack for about two dollars more.",1324339200,,300,4.280701754385965
8078474,5,B000AGTPWI,"I have several Davey & Goliath VHS tapes but I was thrilled to find that Amazon carried the DVD's. I have been looking for this beloved series for many years. I am a 62 year old grandma who watched Davey & Goliath as a child. I still love it, and now can share it with my own sweet grandchildren. Thanks Amazon!",1313971200,,311,4.114754098360656

8078476,5,B000AGTPWI,"Although wonderful, don't buy it on Amazon!  I found all FOUR volumes at the Dollar Tree for..., well $1 each!  $4!  For the exact same product.  I bought two sets, one for my family and one for my brother, whom I used to watch D&G with on Sunday mornings in the 60's.  He loves them as well, great childhood memories!!",1230508800,,319,4.25
8078477,5,B000AGTPWI,"I never missed this as a child. When I found it on DVD I was so excited. Got it for my God children. Very good morals that never get outdated. The anamation is still cool today. They are digitally remastered and much beter than I remember on TV Great for children to learn right from wrong and it doesn't preach any certain religion even though the Lutheran Church produced them. Lessons on being kind to one another, telling the truth, Minding your parents, Not stealing. What American children need before so much super heros and violent cartoons.",1216252800,,549,4.670103092783505
