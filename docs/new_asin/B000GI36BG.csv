2613832,5,B000GI36BG,"I purchased this product to refresh a 2-year-old Samsung plasma TV that had experienced some burn-in/ghosting issues.  Ran the screen washers as recommended by others here (i.e., several hours) and the screen was clear as new again.  Used the video calibration tools on the plasma TV and a new lcd unit and was able to fine tune both pictures.  Had a few questions so I contacted the company directly and received very helpful responses almost immediately (including one over the weekend!).

2613836,4,B000GI36BG,"I bought this because I had a ""stuck pixel"" on my somewhat older Pioneer Plasma monitor model 5030 HD.  This monitor was over 7 grand, so I must say I FREAKED OUT when there was a tiny red blinking star on the screen!  My eye went right to it EVERY time.  At first I thought this DVD was a ripoff (3 screen washers and various ""calibrators"").  I think patience is the key with this product....I first used a software called JScreen Fix (as the 50"" display is my pc monitor too!) This did not work on its own.  After running the various WASHERS on Pixel Protector, much of the plasma ghosting was gone.  After a few times, the stuck pixel was gone too.  Don't try to use this for a 1/2 hour and say it didn't work.  Patience is the key.  Let it run for the 6 to 7 hours, then try the other washers (2 & 3).  I did see an improventment and the red dot is thankfully gone!  Would it have gone away on its own?  Not sure.  But it is gone now!",1233360000,14,938,4.005405405405406

I was desperate, my wife she's always browsing here @Amazon and found PIXEL PROTECTOR DVD. I said let me give it a try for $40.00 I thought it was worth it ( better $40.00 than over $700.00 that I was looking to pay for both tv sets )And to my amazement, IT WORKED! This DVD does what it was made to do. In less that 12 hrs I had my Hitachi big screen as new as the day I got it. I'M NOT KIDDING and my Samsung Slim Fit TV also all in less that a week I'm glad to say both sets are working just fine.. :)

To my surprise this DVD is pretty good. I ended up using most of the stuff on it to calibrate my Plasma and also used it on my second TV which is an LCD. They both look better then they did before I used this disk on them.
I found it easy to use with its well laid out menus that guide you through the different processes, simple and effective just the way I like things.

The burn removal screens look a bit strange but they did work. The 4:3 burn on my 42"" plasma has gone and I am very pleased about that as you can imagine. The burn took a bit longer to remove then the instructions in the DVD said but we got there in the end.",1181865600,8,766,4.0

2613843,1,B000GI36BG,My LCD tv has a five inch pixel line with is not working properly. I decided to buy this application after doing some research on the internet. The shipping process was very fast indeed. But the most import is the item. And it doesn't work at all. I did all the tests recomended during long periods of time (minimum 8 hours per day) and the result: nothing. I did a big mistake buying this application.

2613844,1,B000GI36BG,"I have two plasma screens with the same station identification burn, this station is the only one that has their obtrusive ID up all the time (hint ,hint?)
Any way I bought this with HOPES of it clearing up the problem (also very apprehensive,knowing there really isn't any way to repair screen burn). I ran the screen washes according to the instructions (proper contrast settings,etc.) Ran for over the minimally suggested duration times and well beyond the suggested frequency times. This took several weeks and I have not noticed ANY improvement to either screen. They are both top line Samsung screens and I have also tried the Samsung scrolling bars to remedy the problem. The pixel shift feature on the screens might have helped if I constantly left it on but felt it caused other problems ,so it wasn't left on all the time.
As far as the other features of the DVD go....I didn't need to calibrate my screens , I have another program that does that so I didn't try ""Pixel Protector's"" set up screens. I'm sure they are no better or worse than all the other ones that are out there. My purchase was based on the claim that it would repair screen burn in damage , so if you have that problem you'd best look elsewhere...but I'm pretty sure that once a screen has that damage in the pixels it can not be corrected...best method is to avoid getting it, (not watching channels with static images for more than 2 hours , etc). Probably should've taken my own advice.
So if you are buying this DVD with the hopes of clearing up screen burn in...save your money. Amazon's got a GREAT return policy by the way , where you can get your account credited BEFORE you send back the product ,you print out your return labels and have within the 30 days to send it back...my account was credited back the day after i requested it.",1361059200,2,1822,4.524242424242424

2613850,1,B000GI36BG,"When I first read Amazon's top review, it gave me hope that this product would actually help my plasma problem. I have the same Pioneer unit with exactly the same flashing red pixel and thought I would have described the problem with my plasma in identical fashion. That being said, I spent over thirty hours attempting to achieve any improvement in either the flashing red pixel and/or picture quality. In the end, I was unable to achieve any improvement whatsoever.

I sent an e-mail to the companies website and described my problem and asked for help and I did not receive any response.

Fortunately, Amazon has a return policy so I returned this useless DVD.

Any review reporting any positive improvement in picture from use of this ""Pixel Protector"" is more likely the result of a psychosomatic and hopeful perception rather than any objectively verifiable visual improvement.

Newer Plasma units have started to incorporate systems that protect the screen from the dreaded ""burn in,"" but they fall a bit short when it comes to helping you fine tune your system and make those critical adjustments that take your viewing experience to the next level. This handy tool is a lot more valuable than what you pay for it when you consider you can use it over and over again with every plasma screen in the house.

Basically the TV was useless as 50% of the screen was negative images of what they should have been. Tried 2 of the screen washes to no success. The snow screen washer completly removed all lines after a few hours of running the DVD. I never thought this would actually work but I was shocked and completely satisfied.

2613859,1,B000GI36BG,"Do not buy this disc.

Ok, now that I got that out right away I can tell you why.

First, this disc is nothing more then tons of test patterns thrown onto a disc from other companies. On top of it... You cannot calibrate anything with it. Each pattern conflicts the last. Heck, the simple plan Jane, easy as pie, THX calibrator that comes on alot of movies... Makes your TV look better then this things horrible attempt at doing it.

Like other's, I mainly bought this to help with screen burn over the years. I've use it for many hours over a week. Yet the lines still appear on my TV. Just switching to AIR (static fuzz) on my TV produces better results then this things main wash.

I'm going to end of returning this hunk of worthless plastic. $32 is way to much for something so poorly made. It doesn't even come with a printed manual... Instead you get a poorly written PDF file on the disc.",1286841600,,896,4.284023668639053
2613860,3,B000GI36BG,"Have been using this disc for a few weeks; it does clean up the picture, but it's taking a long time to get rid of my smoke lines when dark scenes are being shown. The calibration works well; worth giving it a try for the money.",1285632000,,228,3.9782608695652173
2613861,4,B000GI36BG,"After I purchased a demo model of the Panasonic TC-P54G10 found it had bad screen burn in.  After searching the internet found pixel protector.  Was very skeptical if it would work, but for less than 50.00 what did I have to lose.  I have run it 3 times at the recommended times and found the burn in has reduced by 75% is suspect after running it a few more times it will be gone.  The calibration section is good but the lack of instructions make it hard to understand what you are trying to do.  I bought the Bluray version which is easier the screen washes will run until you stop them so you don't have to babysit as they are running.

I would recommend this to anyone who has burn in.  If it is light you may find it will be removed after the first use.  Mine was very bad could actually read the channel logo it was on for weeks I'm sure being a demo unit.  After using the calibration the picture was much clearer and setting the color was easy.  I ran it on my other smaller plasma and was surprised at the overall clarity and colors are more true to life.",1279584000,2,1065,4.151219512195122

Have LED LCD TVs in the house and at least once a month run each of the Pixel Washes for several hours. Brightens up the picture quality and sharpens the video as well, in the before and after reviewing. Have recommended this to many people. Only one person has ever gotten back to me, and he stated that he couldn't believe how the washes revived his old Sony CRT that he'd just about given up on, plus his new LED LCD as well. Several people have scoffed at me using it on LCD screens, but just told them to try it and see for themselves! I definitely don't want to be without it.",1278460800,,671,4.209302325581396

After I wasted the ink to print the 21 page instruction manual it still made no sense.  The manual shows you a few test screens and is real vague at explaining what to do with each one, then when you put the DVD in it shows you different test screens that are not in the manual and asks you to select one.  So then test screens show up on your TV for around 20 seconds each then it changes to another one and you are supposed to hit pause each time and adjust something on each one.  The problem is very few of the test screens are in the manual so you have no idea what to adjust on 3/4 of them.

2613868,2,B000GI36BG,"I don't like to write bad reviews, and I always try to look for the silver lining in every situation.  Unfortunately, that kind of positivity isn't always possible without being dishonest with yourself.  That being said, I want to start by making it clear that I purchased this product for calibration only.  I've never had any experience with its advertised ability to fix dead pixels, picture burn-in, etc., so if that's what you're looking for, you may stop reading now.

I bought a 46"" LCD HDTV, and I was having trouble configuring the brightness and contrast in a way that would accommodate both bright and dark scenes.  I'd heard about calibration DVDs, and since this one had the highest rating, I thought I'd give it a try.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations.  Truth be told, it didn't do much of anything.

If you don't have a printer, or at least access to one, don't bother buying this DVD for calibration.  You need the manual to do it properly, but they didn't include a printed copy, despite the exorbitant price.  If you want to calibrate your TV, you must either work with the instructions on your computer's monitor, or use up precious paper and ink.

It might be worth printing if the instructions worked, but they're extremely vague, and they leave you fumbling through the program trying to figure out how to get to each screen.  Even after an hour of tinkering, I couldn't find several of the calibration screens depicted in the instructions, and 80% of the calibration screens I did find weren't described in the manual.  Am I supposed to intuitively know how to calibrate each screen?  Isn't that why I bought the DVD?  If I knew how to do it, I'd just calibrate it based on normal television.

At the end of the day, this product didn't help my picture at all.  Maybe it was my fault, but I honestly don't see how an average person could reasonably be expected to use this tool effectively.  If you don't already know how to calibrate your television set, don't waste your money on this product.  If you already know what you're doing, find some calibration images online and burn them to a DVD.  You'll save yourself a lot of money.",1252454400,10,2176,4.631853785900783

2613870,5,B000GI36BG,"Let me start by saying that I spent nine years in the broadcast television industry as a production engineer so I know a good product when I see one. Seeing the need to better calibrate my TV's picture and not wanting to rely strictly on sight based adjustments I set out to find a good setup disc. I couldn't pull the trigger on the other discs available at Amazon. They would be either too difficult to use or too simplistic. My search lead me to PixelProtector. Bingo! It has exactly what you need to optimize your picture. There are a variety of test screens with clear instructions (on a printable PDF file) that show you how to maximize your set's brightness, contrast, color, & sharpness. If you don't use a disc with test patterns and standards but rely upon subjective images to make setting judgments, then why bother with a setup disc? Anybody can say ""I like when the picture has a lot of color"" and many do, not realizing that they're cheating themselves out of a superior viewing experience. Ask yourself if you remember the picture looking like that at the theater. The director of the show or movie you're watching knows exactly how much color, brightness, etc. the scene needs to create the response he/she wants you to experience. That's why you'll notice changes in the way scenes are shot. Besides, TV sets with artificially boosted settings consume a lot of power costing you in a higher electrical bill. You can save money and have a better picture for the cost of purchasing PixelProtector and investing 30 min. of your time. The single hardest DVD I have to make look good on my TV is the movie ""Hitch"" starring Will Smith. There are more subdued color scenes in this movie than any other I own. The improvement is noticeable. It now looks like I'm back in the theater.

Another benefit of this disc are the included screen washes. I've used all three for half an hour each and I now notice how much whiter the whites are. Even the black level looks better. I plan to make screen washing a routine event to preserve a good looking TV. You'd do well to pick up a copy of PixelProtector and use it. You won't regret it.",1248480000,7,2141,4.532299741602067
