7863073,3,6304118910,"The tape is worth 5 stars... as expected only VHS quality of course, but to see PP&M is well worth it. 3 stars because when I purchased there was only one left. Now that I've watch the tape at home, there STILL is only one left... FALSE ADVERTISING! Also: Prime shipping took 3 days not 2. On the plus side the box and tape looked in pristine condition. It was shrink wrapped which I appreciate, but anyone can do that.",1515542400,,419,4.25

7863075,4,6304118910,"Yes, I did like it but I was expecting a replica of the DVD as there were some songs that were not on this VCR?? Also on the DVD there were more artists than on the VCR. Also on the VCR there was a patch of ""waveing"" for about 5 or 6 minutes. Thanking you, Tony Lawson.",1386979200,,269,3.736842105263158
7863076,5,6304118910,"Ordering this Peter, Paul and Mary tape was a trip down memory lane. I have been a big fan from the beginning as well as a fan of The Weavers.
The seller had it to me in a matter of days and I have watched and re-watched it, boring friends I am sure, several times.  Thank you for your promptness in shipping.",1238976000,4,309,3.9838709677419355
