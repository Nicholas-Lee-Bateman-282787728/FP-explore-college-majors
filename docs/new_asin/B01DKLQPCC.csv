8756186,4,B01DKLQPCC,"Star Trek (the first in the J.J. Abrams series) was okay. It obviously was not intended to replace the original. The acting was decent enough and the characterizations by Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, and Simon Pegg were well-suited to taking up where the original cast ended. There appeared to be much scrutiny by the new cast of the mannerisms of Shatner, Nimoy, and the other original cast. But I would not call it Star Trek XI..",1472688000,,455,4.7
