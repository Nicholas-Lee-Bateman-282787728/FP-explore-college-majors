Kills were ok but not the greatest and the acting was really weird. Evidently this was filmed in Sweden or something and the whole movie they are trying to speak perfect english and make it feel like an American film which is very werid, awkward, and sometimes funny to watch. The main selling point in this movie I think is the killer because I think he is awesome looking and has something not quite right with him. Worth a rent but not the $6 price tag. Just wait till June when this is released.",1365552000,5,668,4.2265625
5181848,4,B008U0XQ3K,"This was basically a Slasher movie about a woman that goes to a house in the Icy woods for a well needed rest ,she meets up with an old boyfriend at a local bar. They reminisce about old times then he and 2 of his friends ""another couple"" come back with her to hang out and end up spending the night in the creepy house she's staying in.

Short on Plot but good on Gore and it has a very cool and interesting killer.
It has a short running time but that seems to be the trend these days especially with Indie Horror/Slasher Films. The kills were good and the effects done remarkably well especially since I heard that they were working with an absurd 5 grand Budget. Yes Five Grand,(gasp) but they made it work. The camera work was good and there were some very chilling moments,no pun intended.

I love a good slasher in the snow flick,Think Donner Pass and Cold Prey although I liked the plot of these two better but as a whole with the gore and the killer I Believe (Blood Runs Cold) is right up there. There was no explanation about the killer or the origin of the killer but that's ok I kind of got that he was just this cannibal freak that killed for food much like men who hunt deer or rabbit

When the killer got stabbed dust or something like that would kind of spray out he never bled and I wondered how he could see because his eyes were always covered with some weird snow goggles that were painted over so it would be impossible to see,He was somewhat mummified but very cool looking.

In one scene his goggles are taken off and he opens his eyes and I thought to myself O OK, that's the reason he doesn't need to see through the goggles. You will see what I'm speaking about.
I say if you are a die hard slasher fan then Watch it or buy it because a Slasher film is exactly what you are getting. One that is re watchable at that.",1364601600,,1843,4.168539325842697
8530350,4,B008U0XQ3K,"I thought this movie was fantastic. In my opinion it is Sweden's answer to America's ""Chainsaw Massacre"". The acting isn't that bad and the special FX's were spot on great.",1515542400,,172,4.766666666666667
8530351,1,B008U0XQ3K,"Absolutely no tension. Just some people (showing a bit of boob if you like that sort of thing) getting killed in ways that really aren't very interesting, for no apparent reason. No aspect from the acting to the special effects was ever more than barely adequate.",1427760000,,263,4.739130434782608
8530352,2,B008U0XQ3K,"Why is it, that every time  dumb Winona,  had a weapon , she put it down? The scene with her crying with the mucous ball hanging out of her nose lasted a bit too long. I love low budget slasher flicks with unknown casts, particularly in some isolated locale, but this movie lacked  dialogue and mystery. Her boyfriend died  too early. Looking at the killers eyes at the end, was he an alien, a demon or what? I don't need a thousand bodies, but there could have been a few more victims, with character. Maybe three more?  This movie fell flat, yet not boring. A running crying, scared victim does not make for a good movie, if that is all there is to her. A ""super killer"" should have a reason for being.",1424563200,,704,4.2631578947368425
8530353,2,B008U0XQ3K,I fellasleep halfway through the first viewing (does that give you a clue?).  Then I gave it a chance and picked it up where I left off.  I nearly fell asleep again.  Nothing new here...very s-l-o-w...and so unbelievable.  It all happens in this tiny house in the snow and they spend half the movie creeping around looking for a killer (not trying to escape). Totally boring.  Don't waste your time or money.,1393200000,,408,4.611111111111111
8530354,4,B008U0XQ3K,"I'm not that into slasher movies, I like suspenseful horror, but this one had enough suspense to keep me watching. I love the setting out in the snowy forest, such a ripe spot for the plot of a horror movie, this one doesn't dissappoint.",1390089600,,237,4.409090909090909
8530355,1,B008U0XQ3K,This film is terrible. Four victims; one killed off screen. Unlikable characters. No plot. Silly CGI enhanced winter-clothing-based killer with no backstory or motive.,1387238400,,167,6.0
8530356,3,B008U0XQ3K,typical last your blood and gore movie... I wouldn't recommend it even to the most avid  horror fans...  the ending leaves a lot to be desired...,1379980800,,145,4.538461538461538
8530357,1,B008U0XQ3K,This movie was incredibly dull and badly acted. It looked very amateurish and the cinematography is terrible. You'd be better off watching paint dry on a wall instead of this dud.,1379548800,,179,4.806451612903226
8530358,3,B008U0XQ3K,"Winona (Hanna Oldenburg) is a stressed out musician who rents a house in the woods so she can go to the town bar. Here she meets her old boyfriend Rick (Patrick Saxe) who can't read a line and his two lively friends Liz (Elin Hugoson) and Carl (Andreas Rylander). They decide to take the ""party"" back to the house, one that has an unwanted guest who looks exactly like the guy on the cover.

The opening scene was a slasher special effects dream. The were cold faces covered blood and snow. The older dried blood had turned dark, almost black, while the fresh blood from the wound was bright red, dripping like Karo syrup. Snowflakes that had fallen on his coat was mixed with blood. Clearly they knew what they were doing with special effects. The plot wasn't very linear and the action starts at 40 minutes into this 77 ,minute film, which accounts for the teaser opening shot.

The acting was not impressive, these are all newcomers. They also needed better lines. Toward the end when a head is smashed, we see the guy move his hand to the rock on his face to steady it. They could have cut out a few seconds, but I guess a 76 1/2 minute movie doesn't sell as well as a 77 minute film.

Now in a Scooby-Doo mystery they introduce the kindly Mr. Carswell in the beginning so we can figure out who the villian is in the first three minutes. I have seen the film and I don't know who it is. As far as I can tell, the film was shot in the part of Sweden where everyone speaks English to P.O. the cannibals.

Okay slasher rental.

8530359,3,B008U0XQ3K,"I've seen many foreign horror films over the years, but I can honestly say I don't think I've ever seen a Swedish slasher flick before.  I didn't even realize this film was foreign until I started watching it and heard the actors speaking English with thick accents.  But do the Swedish know how to make a good slasher flick?  Well yes...and no.  BLOOD RUNS COLD is an effective and chilling horror film, but it does have a couple of issues.

Before I start this review, I feel I should preface it by stating this one will contain spoilers.  I don't normally reveal a lot of specifics in my reviews, and I do this on purpose; after all, why should you watch something I recommend if I've already disclosed everything to you?  But there are a couple of big aspects in this one that bugged me, so I'm going to point them out and see if anyone feels the same.

BLOOD RUNS COLD is shot very well for the most part and looks great overall.  There are a few shaky camera angles when the intensity kicks up, but nothing that really detracts too much from the film overall.  Also, the special effects and gore are excellent; there are some truly cringe-inducing scenes that get a nice boost from some top notch carnage.

The story is impressive as well.  The concept that someone goes to the wrong house by mistake and pays for it in a horrific way is not new, but the production team does a great job of scaring us with it regardless.  I particularly like the killer; he looks creepy and would do Jason Vorhees justice in the `invincible slasher' department.

But BLOOD RUNS COLD has two major flaws that pulled me out of the film.  First, the acting is...weird.  The cast looks like they have a lot of potential, but their lines come off as bland and non-effective.  I think this might be in part because they are speaking English, which doesn't appear to be their primary language.

Secondly, there are NO explanations given for who the killer is or why he's a cannibal or even why he cannot die.  Nor are we told the reasons for his silver-colored eyes (you have to see them), or why he has a hidden ice-cave under his house.  If you want to be technical, we are never really told why he's attacking these people in the first place; it is assumed because they are trespassing in his house...but it's never really stated.

These issues are strictly my opinions and you might feel they can be overlooked.  I was able to look past them and enjoy the film, however I know that some of my devoted horror aficionados will be annoyed with them.

As for a recommendation, BLOOD RUNS COLD is going on my Make Your Own Mind Up list.  This means that I enjoyed it and I recommend it, but I'm not sure if non-diehard horror fans will like it or not.  The film is available today in a variety of formats.",1372723200,2,2787,4.407045009784736
