8003728,5,B0000VJINY,"This marvelous work of cinema verite about four unsupervised 14-year-old girls on the loose in the city is so real, the characters seem like people you know. But artful photography and an expressionist conclusion show that director Lawrence Lau also exercised careful creative control. The resulting film is beautiful and disturbing. It's like lightning in a bottle and one of the best films ever made anywhere about misspent youth.",1233705600,3,432,5.27536231884058
