1228991,3,B00000IQUP,"This amazon.com product detail page is for the High Quality SP mode release of the video. It has not been released on DVD. Another listing of this same movie ""A Bunny's Tale"" is actually a low-quality cheap-o EP mode release which I made the mistake of buying. This higher quality release is the PRISM video and is SP mode.

The film is from a TV Movie rarely shown today. Kirstie Alley plays the real-life character Gloria Steinem who went undercover to expose the life of a Playboy Bunny cocktail waitress. She recounted her tale in a women's magazine that won her great acclaim. The film takes you through the all the steps and humiliations women went through in order to make it as a Bunny. Although it is not entirely a feminist expose. There's plenty of stuff for guys here. Although it is a TV movie so no playboy style nudity. Would of preferred an ""R"" rated version!",1210204800,,875,4.537974683544304
1228992,5,B00000IQUP,"This movie is really a good one.  Really gives true view of what the playboy clubs were like.  The funniest part would have to be when they all dance to ""The Stripper"".  A must see movie!",954115200,7,187,4.138888888888889

7911507,5,B00000IQUP,"I saw this film some years ago and really enjoyed it. Kirsty Alley was great in the role of an under-cover reporter and there are other actresses that most will recognize in this vehicle, all of whom did a wonderful job. If memory serves me, it is a true story about Gloria Steinem...?

I just wish they would put this on DVD!!! I especially wanted to watch it now that Hef just passed away....",1506556800,,394,4.324324324324325
7911508,5,B00000IQUP,"Based on a magazine article in 1962, Kirstie Allie plays Gloria Steinem who went ""undercover"" to work as a bunny for 3 weeks to get material for her story.  However since the TV network who made the movie asked for help from the Playboy corporation for costuming and so forth, the movie comes out as little more balanced than her magazine article, which was intended to stir up outrage with a soupcon of titillation on the side since it was 1962 or 63 when she published it and dressing in the equivalent of a ""bathing suit"" was still somewhat shocking. In adding in more scenes to make a short article into a movie, they managed to show that the girls did have fun together, dancing when the club wasn't open to the talented singing of one of the bunnies and so forth. Now that everyone has seen ""Madmen"" and so forth, we've learned that this job was actually, although sexist on the surface, actually one of the less actual sexually harassed jobs a woman (particularly with little education, although many bunnies did have college degrees) could work in the early 60s. Playboy also allowed bunnies attending college to work around their class schedules, something many food service jobs won't bother to do even today. It also got many who aspired to show business, the chance to meet people through whom she could break into the show business and a reason to remember her as more than just one more pretty face among many (and Playboy corporation maintains a list of all those bunnies who achieved stardom). The one legitimate critique Steinem made, un-necessary medical exams before employment, was dropped as soon as she raised the question in her article. Her other biggest bitch was that her costume was uncomfortable, but all real bunnies had a uniform made just for them - it was her short-timer attitude right from the start that made the bunny mother decide that she'd wait a bit before investing the seamstress' time in creating a custom outfit for a person who seemed as though she wasn't intending to stay. Taking the job for a few days just for the right to say ""I was hired as a bunny"" wasn't unusual. Real bunnies will tell you the costume was very comfortable, and it was really the high heels that were killers. High quality shoes quickly made their value known and those who bought cheaper heels soon replaced them, but even the best shoes can't make hours on your feet go away. Waitresses who wear flats will also tell you their feet are tired at the end of a busy shift. Debbie Harry once remarked when asked about her time as a bunny that ""after that job I could have climbed Mount Everest in high heels"". The one thing that Steinem got right was the lack of opportunities for women to work in the early 60s. For instance, One of the bunnies she worked with had graduated high school at only 16 and  had a college bachelors in mathematics, but worked as a waitress. Another one of the bunnies would go on to become a research division head in the NIH, but not until the 80's when employment was more equal. But none of them, except Gloria, ever regretted their time working with good friends and a making a good living at a time when most women couldn't earn that much.

7911512,3,B00000IQUP,"This was probably one of Kirstie Alley's more deeper portrayals,after all, it was based on fact. It showed not all was glamorous at the Playboy club for those ""bunnies"".There are laws that apply everywhere as to being touched or grabbed in the workplace, and that includes the Playboy club. The boss should look into that. Otherwise ,while I didn't expect much more, this played more like a documentary. It was still worth checking out, though. Informative.",1366156800,,457,5.026315789473684
7911513,4,B00000IQUP,"See Delta Burke and Kirstie Alley back when they were hot and before they ballooned up like Oprah.

The movie is marred by some feminist whining crap and the plight of women, as if it working at the Playboy Club was any worse than the poor bastard who is a Mcdonalds manager, but most of that is easily ignored and you get a glimpse into the past when women were expected to look and act like women.

Keep an eye out for Lela Rochon in her first credited role (she was an extra in the Breakin' films) a full 4 years before her first well known appearance in Harlem Nights.

While not quite a full on T&A flick, it's a fun movie with lots of talent in bunny costumes. Of course one has to of course overlook the basic hypocrisy of criticizing the objectification of women by the Playboy Clubs while using cute actresses in bunny outfits to make the movie interesting and marketable.",1340150400,2,881,4.359756097560975
