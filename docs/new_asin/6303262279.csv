614290,5,6303262279,This video is both educational and entertaining as both my husband and my 4-year-old enjoy it! We highly recommend any of the Fred Levine videos.,1239926400,,145,4.84
614291,5,6303262279,"This video is captivating for toddlers and children....ok, and even for adults!  It seems fresh and exciting every time you watch it.  It obviously was made by a man with a childlike heart and spirit because it captures all the excitement that a young person experiences when they see a plane take off, land, or flies by overhead.  It educates while it entertains.  It's very funny at times and makes my grandson giggle with delight. It's a video that you can feel good about your child watching over and over...and they will!",1196985600,5,526,4.684782608695652
614292,5,6303262279,My 2 year old daughter was fascinated with the airplanes in this video.  She has watched it a million times.  It does a very good job of outlining what a day of air travel will be like for a child.  This was very helpful in preparing my daughter for our vacation.  She stayed very calm throughout the airport/flight experience---the complete opposite of what happened on another trip a few months before watching this video.  I highly recommend buying this if you plan on traveling with toddlers in the near future!,1184284800,3,515,4.677777777777778
614293,2,6303262279,"We are also big fans of Fred Levine but I was really dismayed when we received this video. It's almost nothing like his other efforts. It spends half the time on his kids - riding in the car, checking into a hotel, eating pretzles, riding on a hotel shuttle etc etc, and almost no time on explaining what goes on in the plane or at the airport. No explanation of the control tower, the cockpit, loading the plane with supplies or any of ther other interesting things I was hoping to see. I definitely got the feeling that the only reason he made this video was so he could write off a family vacation on his taxes. If you want to see vacation footage of the Levine family, then this video is for you. Otherwise, save your money.",999043200,8,728,4.282608695652174
7842320,1,6303262279,Worst quality possible. Disk menu does not work. Fast forward doesn't work. Plastic disk box was cracked and broken upon delivery. Not worth a buck!,1520121600,,148,4.96
7842321,2,6303262279,Not as good as the others we have.,1496534400,,34,3.375
7842322,5,6303262279,Another 5 star from Fred Levine! Contemporary feel and fun to watch! My son is obsessed. So glad we found this series. : ),1495670400,,122,4.125
7842323,5,6303262279,My grand children really enjoy this dvd.  It is a great tool for helping children understand/ prepare to fly.  The only thing I wish was not in the DVD is where the child is standing on the seat and seems to misbehave. We discussed how one should behave and the rest is a great lesson for preparing young children to traveling on an airplane.,1487030400,,342,4.328125
7842324,5,6303262279,excellent,1482883200,,9,9.0
7842325,5,6303262279,"Kids love these videos! We started with Road Construction Ahead, then got the Farm Country one. My son LOVES them. Very educational and (thankfully) short at about 30 minutes. They are old school, and parents- you will get a laugh out of the 1990's clothes and cars! The airplane one (here) is good, although so far Farm Country is the best. We're slowing getting the entire set, which should tell you something given the low production budgets and age of this series.",1466726400,,468,4.719512195121951
7842326,5,6303262279,"All I know is, when I was 5 years old I watched this over and over.  Now I'm a pilot.",1387670400,,85,3.25
7842327,5,6303262279,My child loves to fly now and often wants to watch this movie just for fun.  We bought it to help her feel comfortable on her first airplane ride.  Good choice!,1318377600,,160,4.129032258064516
7842328,5,6303262279,"My little guy loves everything airplanes, and he loves this DVD. He's watched it numerous times and still enjoys it.  he's learned alot from it too.",1311292800,,148,4.6923076923076925
7842329,3,6303262279,My 2 year old son loves this DVD. He doesn't seem to mind its very outdated and that the DVD doesn't even have a menu option on the disc.,1300492800,,137,3.7586206896551726
