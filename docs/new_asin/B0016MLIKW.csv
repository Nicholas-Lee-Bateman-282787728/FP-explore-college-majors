And I said, ""Here am I! Send me!""
---Isaiah 6:8

Like Saint Francis of Assisi, he was born into wealth and privilege but was drawn by compassion to serve the poor and outcast. Dad wanted him to be an educator following a certain path, but he joined the Augustinian Order and at 25 became a priest. Strongly attracted to the evangelical Francis and his friars, he obtained permission from church authorities to join the Franciscans where he is remembered today as a great preacher and miracle worker.
Eleven months after he died, he was declared a saint.",1360195200,,643,4.543103448275862
3159279,4,B0016MLIKW,"My wife and I watched the English-language dubbed-in version. The movie itself has many scenes that seem to be disconnected, making the plot hard to follow for a significant portion of the showing. For this reason, it is sometimes hard to piece together what is going on. WARNING: The film has many violent scenes, including the death of a child. It is also more emotionally intense, at times, than most American films.

Anthony of Padua is shown confronting the Church and its departure from Christ-like simplicity. Anthony also faults the Church for forgetting that Christ was born in a manger.

The highlight of the film is Anthony's confrontation of the usurers. They had gotten rich by exploiting the people, while the people were reduced to abject poverty in paying off the loans, or put in prison for being unable to do so. One of the usurers repents from his sinful wealth-seeking lifestyle.",1359158400,4,899,4.907894736842105

3159281,1,B0016MLIKW,"What more is there to say that isn't in the title of this review. St. Anthony has been a special patron in our family for over 20 years, and watching this film...inaccurate and dull. I cannot provide examples as I saw this movie a while ago, but the feeling of absolute disgust has not left me. I haven't seen any other movies on St. Anthony, so I'm afraid I cannot recommend one in this one's stead. :-(",1351123200,4,404,4.259740259740259
3159282,2,B0016MLIKW,"This film version of the great St. Anthony of Padua is quite disappointing in that it misses the real essence of this incredible saint, and presents him as some kind of ""revolutionary"" and corruption seeker, even going after Church officials, etc.

Sorry, the real Saint Anthony was a very holy, learned man who loved God and man devoutly and wholeheartedly, a deeply spiritual,prayerful man whose closeness to almighty God gave him even miraculous powers to heal the sick, raise the dead, and convert the most hardened sinners. He was not a ""warrior"" or a ""revolutionary"" - he was a great Saint, one who closely imitated Christ.

A much better film version is the film ""SAINT ANTHONY"", starring Italian actor Daniele Liotti, also available on Amazon.",1222905600,39,751,5.0
3159283,4,B0016MLIKW,"Note: Italian with English subtitles.

The '06 film `Anthony: Warrior of God' tells the story of the 13th century Catholic saint in a reverent manner accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack which adds substantially to the feel of holiness surrounding this cinematic feature.  The production values are superior and Jordi Molla is wonderful as the impassioned Franciscan monk and self-proclaimed defender of the poor and disenfranchised. His battle against the corrupt civil authorities, the ruthless money lenders and yes, even the Catholic Church is well done and believable.

There is much in here that reminds me of Franco Zeffirelli's `Brother Sun, Sister Moon' which happens to be one of my favorite films. While `Anthony: Warrior of God' has the look and feel of the Italian classic from '72, particularly in the segment at the Vatican during his audience with the Pope, it falls short of duplicating the simple, innocent charm and emotional impact of the Saint Francis film.

Another minor flaw in the film was how abrupt and truncated the storyline was presented. Anthony strolls into Padua, makes a couple of scathing speeches and suddenly everything is better. A little more plot development and detail would have been appreciated. With that said it's still a worthwhile watch which will be particularly enjoyed by a Catholic audience.",1214092800,12,1343,5.232558139534884
3159284,5,B0016MLIKW,"I didn't know much about St. Anthony before I saw this movie, except for hearing my Italian relatives invoke his name in moments of desperation. After seeing it, though, I understood why he's so popular. This is a great piece of historical drama, and the first theatrical film that ignores the legends and deals with the facts surrounding the life of Anthony of Padua. He risked his life standing up for the poor and oppressed in a time when ""oppression"" was just another word for ""government"".
My only criticism with the film is the lack of back story. Anthony makes his entrance as a shipwreck victim, and the focus is on the deeds that made him so beloved and famous among Christians of the 13th century.  Great perfomances by Jordi Molla as Anthony, and by Paolo De Vita who plays Anthony's closest disciple and the film's narrator.",1211846400,5,836,4.687074829931973

I understand this is not a Hollywood movie yet it is done with best available resources.
I like it because it is Saint Anthony ! I am glad that it still brings the inspiration and creates the respect
for the Church Saints. Saint gave his life to serve the poor for which Lord Jesus came to this earth makes this movie
is right. I also liked the extra in the DVD, mainly all the interview which explains the background. My advice is first watch the extra before you go for the movie. Also a reminder that the DVD comes with a voice dub in English otherwise like me you will be ending up watching it in another language with English subtitle !",1404345600,,715,4.264705882352941
