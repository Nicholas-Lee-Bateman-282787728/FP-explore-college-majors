4044924,2,B0030GBSZM,I usually like documentary type films. This one just didn't deliver for me. If nothing sparks my interest in the first 20 minutes it is a chore to stick with it.,1397174400,,161,4.225806451612903
4044925,5,B0030GBSZM,Very well done documentary about how personal and political agendas and the media can trample on human rights. SRO hotels are a much needed but vanishing housing option in cities all across this country.,1392681600,4,203,5.0
4044926,1,B0030GBSZM,"I decided to watch Heroin Town with an open mind, especially considering I hail from a city with it's own fair share of national media attention (Murder Capital of America).  But it became quickly apparent that this documentary was anything but balanced.

The purpose of the documentary was to challenge a feature by 60 Minutes that shined a spotlight on the heroin problems plaguing Willimantic, and more specifically, The Hotel Hooker.  The problem is that much of the documentary is dedicated to interviews with a handful of Willimantic residents who claim that things aren't as bad as CBS made them out to be.

The documentary goes from biased to downright bizarre as local children are interviewed to comment on the status of Willimantic's drug problems, and Dan Rather is demonized in spoken word performances.  Everyone interviewed simply comes off as being extremely defensive of the town.

After finishing the documentary, which was devoid of hard evidence, I did a bit of research on the town's problem.  What I found was that in a town of 15,000 people, their methadone clinic receives 250 visitors on a daily basis.  That number excludes an additional 200-300 addicts living in the town.  The Executive Director of Community Prevention and Addiction Service Inc stated that ""It's an amazing percentage of users for a city this size.""

The Statewide Narcotics Task Force, released figures that showed local and state law enforcement make more heroin arrests in Willimantic than every town the same size or larger.  In 2000, the task force arrested 45 in Willimantic for heroin, whereas only one person was arrested in Bristol that year, despite having 60,000 residents.

The aforementioned stats were provided by Willimantic social workers and local law enforcement alike.  That alone seems to deflate the ""Dan Rather doesn't know what it's like to live here"" angle.

Not much effort seemed to be put into this documentary.  The video quality was poor, and the audio mixdown was simply terrible (volume at max, and it's still hard to hear dialogue).  Plus the interviews with random townsfolk didn't make for any compelling arguments.

It's very rare that I rate a DVD one star, and it's unfortunate that a film that many were so passionate about had to earn it.  But it's simply biased, uninteresting, and about as far from objective as a documentary could be.",1311033600,44,2372,5.023017902813299
4044927,1,B0030GBSZM,"Remember when Martin Bashir made a fool out of Michael Jackson, so Jacko released his own coutervideo?  This was like that.  I guess ""60 Minutes"" and a CT newspaper called a place Heroin Town due to the large number of heroin addicts at one falling-apart hotel.  This tries to be the counternarrative.
The work says things like, ""Not all of us are addicts"" and ""We have summer fairs in this town!""  Well, most drug centers have non-addicts in the vicinity.  And they are financially-challenged like the non-addicts interviewed here.  This work may help bring investment and governmental dollars into this town, but this is not strong viewing for those unfamiliar with the topic.
This may be a lesson in ""don't throw out the baby with the bath water.""  It may also be a tail on how the media can demonize populations and blow things out of proportion.  Still, this work doesn't have what's needed to stand the test of time.",1310342400,13,922,4.71875

Take Me in Your Arms
(Miss Heroin)

So now, little man, you've grown tired of grass
LSD, goofballs, cocaine and hash,
and someone, pretending to be a true friend,
said, ""I'll introduce you to Miss Heroin.""

Well honey, before you start fooling with me,
just let me inform you of how it will be.

For I will seduce you and make you my slave,
I've sent men much stronger than you to their graves.
You think you could never become a disgrace,
and end up addicted to Poppy seed waste.

So you'll start inhaling me one afternoon,
you'll take me into your arms very soon.
And once I've entered deep down in your veins,
The craving will nearly drive you insane.

You'll swindle your mother and just for a buck.
You'll turn into something vile and corrupt.
You'll mug and you'll steal for my narcotic charm,
and feel contentment when I'm in your arms.

The day, when you realize the monster you've grown,
you'll solemnly swear to leave me alone.
If you think you've got that mystical knack,
then sweetie, just try getting me off your back.

The vomit, the cramps, your gut tied in knots.
The jangling nerves screaming for one more shot.
The hot chills and cold sweats, withdrawal pains,
can only be saved by my little white grains.

There's no other way, and there's no need to look,
for deep down inside you know you are hooked.
You'll desperately run to the pushers and then,
you'll welcome me back to your arms once again.

And you will return just as I foretold!
I know that you'll give me your body and soul.
You'll give up your morals, your conscience, your heart.
And you will be mine until, ""Death Do Us Part""

Someone mentioned there were more heroin arrests in Willy than in Bristol. Ummm. That is because it is way easier to arrest a slow moving heroin addict than it is to catch a car thief or rapist. Lets say Bristol has a high car jacking rate so the cops are busy chasing them. Does it mean that they have a lower heroin problem? Nope. Means the cops are focusing on something else.

I am happy to report that in the intervening years since the 60 Minutes episode, with the strong sense of community there, as well as concerted efforts by state and local law enforcement, social organizations, etc., there has been a real turnaround. Despite the negative ethnic comments made by Lew Rosenbrooks, there is a wonderful sense of integration and diversity which is rather unique in a town of its size.  He seems to insinuate that the Spanish speaking population went there for welfare, but he seems to forget how they were recruited to work in the thread mill when it was open, and that Puerto Ricans are technically as American as he is. When the jobs left, it was their home.  I always felt safe there, any time of day or night.  I never saw a prostitute.  I currently live in southeast Texas, and would love to return to the area.

Instead these people are treated with very little respect and dignity. Drug Addicts, I am sure, do not choose to live this way. These are sick people that don't have many resources,they are usually poor and many suffer from different types of mental illnesses.
