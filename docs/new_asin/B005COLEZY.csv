8465764,4,B005COLEZY,"This is an interesting movie that borders on eclectic, maybe trying to be a cult film.  Keeps you guessing about what science will discover and learn to weaponize next.",1377561600,,168,4.793103448275862
8465765,4,B005COLEZY,"I must say, at first glance I would never have expected to enjoy or watch this film.  Although there is one ""known"" actor (C.Thomas Howell), a majority of the cast is new and fresh. Unfortunately, most people don't spend time watching films unless they are familiar with the cast.  Luckily, I somehow stumbled into watching this film and it definitely surpassed all my expectations! The leading man (Chandler Rylko) is gorgeous and although at first he seems to just be another pretty face, as the film continues you see his comedic charm and sincere vulnerability. I will definitely keep my eyes and ears out for his future work and so should you! The leading lady also has talent, but the side character's are what really add charm to this film.  Every character has a distinct point of view and a certain likability, including the evil professor. This film has drama, comedy, looks, and science fiction all wrapped into one. This isn't an Academy Award winning film, but it sure is a great way to spend an hour and a half entertaining yourself.",1323043200,,1047,4.741758241758242
8465766,4,B005COLEZY,"I watch a fair amount of movies, and i've seen Cupid's Arrow all the way through.  There are a lot of blockbusters that i can't say that about!
For what this movie is and the budget it looks like it had,they really hit the mark. The script was fun, great idea.  The acting was easy and natural.
The main male lead should be picked up for a Gossip girl or Revenge style show. I wasn't sure if he was going to carry the movie at first but he gets better through out and owns it in the end. All the side characters really put on a show from the best friend to the twins. The professor is someone i recognize. He's an amazing actor and he does a great job as the bad guy.  If this film ran at the midnight showing at the  local theaters, It could have an Awesome cult following! Sound track comes out of no where, but adds a style to this movie you wouldn't see coming from the cover shot! All and all a great surprise,would be a great gift to someone who likes under the radar hollywood movies.",1323043200,,991,4.092783505154639
8465767,5,B005COLEZY,"I really liked Cupid's Arrow! I thought it was an interesting concept...was funny, cute, had action, was engaging, and I thought the cast did a really good job. I especially liked the actor, Chandler Rylko in it. He is really talented! I hope to see him in more films coming up.",1322611200,,278,4.470588235294118
8465768,5,B005COLEZY,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it was fast paced action and interaction.  It's not just a entertaining 90 minutes of movie, but after watching it, I was left wondering if this kind of research about love is really happening?... and it dawned on me that it probably is.  Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like to have control over who falls in love with you?  That would be pretty cool.",1322524800,,413,4.337662337662338
