It's great to have this historic material brought to life in such a high-quality production.  Buy it!",1387843200,,259,5.45
8440970,5,B004TWOXEE,"Rostropovich's performance of the Rococo Variations is exhilarating.  Also it's interesting to see Britten conduct repertoire (Romeo and Juliette) that one would not normally associate with him.  However, the greatest value of this DVD are the sections from Britten's opera Gloriana.  Despite its beautiful score, it was one of Britten's less successful operas and therefore is the only one of his operas that he did not record.  (Of course Death in Venice being an exception, since his final illness prevented his conducting its recording but he did oversee the recording conducted by Stuart Bedford.)  Therefore these excerpts may be the only existing record of Britten interpreting this neglected but great work.  The performances are strong and the sound and video quality are good.  Recommended!",1353196800,4,800,5.403225806451613
