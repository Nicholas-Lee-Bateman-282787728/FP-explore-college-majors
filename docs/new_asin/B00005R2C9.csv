7951531,1,B00005R2C9,Old Movie - Not very good.  Would not recommend.  Spend time with another movie.,1514851200,,80,4.642857142857143
7951532,4,B00005R2C9,Cute older film including horses.  Was great to watch during a cold winter's night.,1514678400,,83,4.928571428571429
7951533,3,B00005R2C9,"The scenery was lovely and the story was very predictable.  The acting was Grade B....at best.  As someone who grew up with horses, everything from the way they ride (especially during the race) to how they feed the animals was poorly done.  But....if you have kids, they'd enjoy it and there is no cursing or sex scenes....so it's safe for them to watch.",1514246400,,355,4.603174603174603
7951534,3,B00005R2C9,"Older film, with a charming story and a lot of melodrama. Daniel J Travanti is very good. I want to warn horse lovers - as someone who knows them and grew up with them - this film will drive you crazy: the director obviously knew little about them. The lead character - although she is supposed to love horses - spends a lot of time yelling at them, slapping them, and pulling on their halters like a five year old. I wanted to kick her in the pants. This is exactly NOT the way to be handling horses. For people who 'grew up around horses' they do a lot of falling off of them and losing control of them. I found myself laughing out loud during the barn scene when the foal is born. Take it from me - you put your arms up a horses' vagina, you do not want to just put your clean jacket back on.  Your arms - and everything else you have on - is covered with slime and blood after that. But THIS girl - she's spotlessly clean!  Good heavens.  So .... watch it with a grain of salt.",1514160000,,981,4.02051282051282

7951536,3,B00005R2C9,"An orphaned 16-year-old Welsh girl, Gwen (Sian MacLean) again has to deal with the loss that death brings when  her grandfather passes away after being thrown in a riding accident. She's left to handle the family farm and all the horses on it until her uncle (Daniel J. Travanti) enters the picture, wanting to sell the property to a greedy land developer. One possible way to keep the farm is for Gwen to enter her beloved black stallion Mabon (named for a Pagan holiday) in the Christmas Costume Race. The climatic scene showing Gwen as an angel riding against Father Christmas and an elf, among others, is certainly one of the more unique racing scenes in the movies - think of it as the Doo-Dah Parade on horseback.
