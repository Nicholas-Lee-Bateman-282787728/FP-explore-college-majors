8267178,1,B0017T1NUE,"be aware this DVD is in a format that may not play on your US DVD / Blueray equipment.  Most US equipment I have seen plays only Region 1 formats.  This DVD is in Region 0 / PAL format.  Will play on a computer, but not on either of my DVD / Blueray players.",1372032000,3,258,3.740740740740741
8267179,3,B0017T1NUE,"As someone that lives in the US, I discovered this show on YouTube.  The show is great - very unusual residential architectural projects along with entertaining stories of the families and their building experiences. Wanting more, I ordered this one DVD to make sure I can play it on my US equipment since it is a UK based show. Nothing was listed in the product description on what countries it would or would not play. Turns out that it is indeed a ""Region Code: PAL"" (as listed on the back of the DVD case). I can play it on my computer with no problems. However, it will not play on my 1 year old TV and Blu-ray player. I enjoy the show so much that I will live with this limitation and maybe order more of the series. If it played on my TV, I would give it 5 stars.",1366156800,3,770,4.133333333333334
