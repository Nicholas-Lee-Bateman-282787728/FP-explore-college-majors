8593329,3,B00DHN8G1W,"I agree with many of the reviewers that the Criterion edition has an incredible treasure trove of extras. This review however is of the film, which is a rambling, inconsistent movie that doesn't have any plot whatsoever. Also, much of the dialogue rambles on and on about incoherent subjects. However, I deeply respect this filmmaker, and I deeply respect what he was going for, which was a portrait of a people in a particular time period in a specific setting. I also enjoyed Linklater's approach of following characters and then veering off to follow someone else.",1422230400,,567,4.916666666666667
