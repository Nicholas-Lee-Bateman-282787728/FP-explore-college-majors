4288009,1,B0049EVR32,"After Solaris I promised myself I'd never pay to see another Clooney movie and I wish I'd kept that promise. The opening scene was promising then Clooney showed up to drive his car for 10 excruciating long minutes before getting out and looking around at three strangers, climbing back in his car and driving again. The WHOLE movie was like watching your dishwasher go through it's cycles, but even that would be more interesting.  Clooney looks 60ish and he must've done this movie to be able to have sex with a young woman. DVD Cover shows him running. LOL. Never (except at the very end). Never did the movie explain WHY his boss wanted to kill him. Never did it explain why the girl his boss hired to Clooney killed her. Don't waste your money even when it comes out on PPV or DVD.",1283731200,6,785,4.451388888888889
4288010,3,B0049EVR32,"""The American"" makes ""Schindler's List"" look like a happy, uplifting film. Seriously. George Clooney plays Jack, an American hit man who relocates from Sweden to Italy after an attempt is made on his life. Jack decides to take on one last assignment before retiring. While in Italy, he falls for Clara (Violante Placido), a local prostitute he's been keeping company with. Eventually Jack figures out that he's still a target, and his miserable existence comes to a predictable end.

I really wanted to like this movie. Clooney is fantastic, as always, and the film features beautiful (and sometimes creepy) scenes from the Italian countryside. Although the audience sympathizes with Jack, we really don't know anything about his past: what led him to this career, what he's been through, etc. Some additional personal information on the character would have been interesting. However, every single part about Jack's life and this movie as a whole is 100%, god-awful depressing. It's hard to like a movie that is just such a downer. Also, the whole Jack/Clara relationship wasn't very believable to me (and I am not just saying that because I am super jealous of Placido for being able to act out those steamy love scenes with Gorgeous George).

Overall, I think this is a good and interesting film, but it's not among my picks for the ultimate George Clooney DVD boxed set, if you know what I mean. (On a positive note, ""The American"" does include a Clooney semi-naked butt shot, so it's worth checking out at least for that.)",1283644800,,1527,4.9147286821705425
4288011,5,B0049EVR32,"""The American"" is great! This is how the story goes: As an assassin, Jack is constantly on the move and always alone. After a job in Sweden ends more harshly than expected for this American abroad, Jack retreats to the Italian countryside. He relishes being away from death for a spell as he holes up in a small medieval town. While there, Jack takes an assignment to construct a weapon for a mysterious contact, Mathilde. Savoring the peaceful quietude he finds in the mountains of Abruzzo, Jack accepts the friendship of local priest Father Benedetto and pursues a torrid liaison with a beautiful woman, Clara. Jack and Clara's time together evolves into a romance, one seemingly free of danger. But by stepping out of the shadows, Jack may be tempting fate.

The cast led by George Clooney (who also produced) (in a subtle and excellent performance as Jack) is great! The directing by Anton Corbijn (who also produced and directed ""Control"" (2007) is great! The screenplay (based on the novel ""A Very Private Gentleman"" by Martin Booth) by Rowan Joffe (who also did the screenplay to ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007) is great!

The music by Herbert Grnemeyer is great! The cinematography by Martin Ruhe (who also did the cinematography to ""Control"" & ""Harry Brown"" (2009) is great! The film editing by Andrew Hulme (who also did the film editing to ""Lucky Number Slevin"" (2006) & ""Control"") is great! The casting by Batrice Kruger (who also did the casting to ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" (2003), ""Miracle At St. Anna"" (2008) & ""Letters From Juliet"" (2010) is great! The production design by Mark Digby (who also did the production design to ""A Mighty Heart"" (2007), ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Never Let Me Go"" (2010), he also did the art direction to ""28 Days Later"" (2003) & ""Millions"" (2004) is great! The art direction by Denis Schnegg (who also did the art direction to ""Millions"", ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005), ""Sunshine"" (2007), ""28 Weeks Later"", ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Never Let Me Go"") & Mikael Varhelyi is great! The set decoration by Michelle Day (who also did the set decoration to ""Millions"", ""The Constant Gardener"", ""Sunshine"", ""28 Weeks Later"", ""Happy-Go-Lucky"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" & the upcoming ""Never Let Me Go"") is great! The costume design by Suttirat Anne Larlarb (who also did the costume design to ""Sunshine"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""The Extra Man"" (2010), ""Peacock"" (2010) & the upcoming ""Beastly"" (2011), she also did the art direction to ""Garfield"" (2004), ""The Namesake"" (2006) & ""The Savages"" (2007) & the production design to the upcoming ""127 Hours"" (2010) is great!

This is a subtle and quiet film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat when it gets good. George Clooney adds another impressive and excellent performance to his array of subtle performances. It may be slow at times, but it is worth watching the movie.",1283558400,6,2893,4.960824742268041
4288012,5,B0049EVR32,"I find 'The American' a hard sell as a film. It's not an action-thriller like the trailers make it out to be, nor would I call it a character drama or art house piece. I can't see either of these audiences appreciating this film on the level it wants you to. I think that's why I like it so much, there's nothing else like it in theaters (at least not right now).

'The American' is about cold-blooded professional ""Jack"" who, after being attacked in Sweden with his girlfriend (which ends violently but not the way you think) is directed by his associate to hide out in a small town in Italy. He ends up friending a priest and a prostitute and takes a job building/modifying a weapon for an assassin. Of course his old enemies catch up to him but the movie chooses more to focus on the main character's slow change from cold-professional to 'maybe' redeemable human being. There's some (very good) action and sex but the story's told in a very leisurely fashion with little dialogue. It's more about what's NOT said between and by characters that gives this movie it's weight and suspense.

The camera work in this film is stunning, and that's a good thing. With the action and  unrevealing dialogue taking a back-seat the movies' long, beautiful shots of Italy really set the movie's mood well and gives the sense of isolation and seeming solitude for it's main character. The slow moving scenes of repetition involving the main character constructing a weapon and the brief word exchanges between the main character and another assassin (a terrific Thekla Reuten) perfectly reflects the mindset the film is in.

George Clooney took a big risk being cast in this film. It's unconventional and will easily put off his usual fans. I can even understand his performance of such a cold-hearted character being written off as one dimensional. I can only say I found Clooney perfectly convincing the entire way through and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves. The rest of the cast is non-americans with Violante Placido a stand-out (in more ways than one) as the prostitute whom Clooney befriends and eventually seems to fall for.

The DVD release of 'The American' looks very slick (even on my crappy tube-television) and comes with an insightful making-of that sheds light on the ideas the directors and producers put into the film. While there are some great cast interviews sadly there's not one with George Clooney. I would've loved to know his take on his character but there is some fun 'behind the camera' footage of him chatting and playing around with the rest of the crew so it's obvious he had fun making this movie.

As I said 'The American' is not for everyone and is very much NOT the movie it's advertised as. It's a slow-moving, adult thriller that manages to be engaging and unpredictable without non-stop action and dialogue. For the right audience this film's a winner!",1283558400,210,2892,4.750996015936255
4288013,2,B0049EVR32,"In the 1950s, Miles Davis introduced something called modal music.  A simple melody was the foundation for highly skilled and creative musicians to solo around.  I assume that was the concept behind this flick.  A simple, uncomplicated story: a highly competent assassin loses his taste for the job, falls in love with a prostitute, then, well the ending (I won't spoil it).  OK, pretty mundane story, I thought this was to be the backdrop for some pretty serious acting chops to be offered.  Umph, wrong!  Clooney and company were not up to the challenge if that was in fact the idea.  After chatting a bit with my wife after it was over, I suddenly realized why this movie was really made.  It was a tax write off for Clooney's Italian Villa.  Two stars only for the beautiful Italian country side.  Bottom line: skip this dreadfully boring, journeyman level exercise in acting and film making.",1283472000,5,896,4.759740259740259
4288014,4,B0049EVR32,"George Clooney's latest film, directed by a former music video director Anton Corbijn, is a film that demonstrates effective use of star power: it's unlikely this film would have gotten any attention (and it's still unlikely to be anything huge) without the presence of the King of Hollywood. Clooney's been willing to loan out his starpower to low-profile films in the past, and he does so again here.  This is a slow-burn story more interested in character interiors than ""Bourne Identity""-style action sequences (though it is not devoid of action), one that will probably divide audiences.  But if you're interested in that sort of film, this has a lot to recommend.  Spoilers follow.

The film opens with a prologue in snowy Sweden, where Jack (Clooney) is cottage-going.  There's a twist here that has been spoiled in some reviews, but is most effective when you don't know about it, so I'll refrain from saying anything.  The key is that it sends our assassin title character on a trip to a small Italian town to await his next assignment from his boss, Pavel (Johan Leysen).  Soon, a new assignment arrives, in the form of assistance to another assassin (Thekla Reuten), and legacies of his last mission also begin to appear.  Whiile there Jack ponders the state of his life, sort-of-befriends a priest (Paolo Bonacelli), and starts to fall in love with a really, really luscious prostitute (Violante Placido).

It's familiar material, but it's played well. The director knows how to use the camera effectively, positioning it in ways that keep the audience on guard for something about to happen.  If I came away with a single impression, it was a strong desire to visit the town in which this was filmed, because it looks stunning.  Clooney really dials down his charisma here (like he did in ""Syriana""), and gives an effective performance. The other actors, mainly Italians, are all effective, particularly Placido, who really sells the idea that our lead character would want to give up his old lifestyle to live with her (and she's very attractive - this is a movie prostitute who actually takes her clothes off). The mark of a good movie is when they can really interest you in the mechanics of the character's profession: we get some long sequences of Clooney at work on his guns, and it's interesting to watch (particularly constructing a sound supressor out of parts from an auto shop).

4288052,2,B0049EVR32,"This had to be one of the harder Clooney films to watch on a number of fronts. While the subject matter and general story was the hook that pulled me in, the overall character portrayals were either overstated at times or so nonsensical, I didn't believe what I was seeing. Stylistically, the film didn't really have much of an identity. I wasn't sure if this was a documentary on the lost spirit of hit men or a James Bond film devoid of the charisma and charm that make you root for the lead character.

George Clooney seems out of sorts in this film and his character's motivation is all over the place. He has zero hesitation killing an innocent lover who unwittingly becomes involved in a hit against him, but seems to regret it after the fact when a fellow agent reminds him about the fallout in getting too close to people in the field. All good and fine in a character study, except he then becomes overly paranoid of every woman he gets close to after this ordeal, as if it's the first time he had to deal with it. For an experienced veteran in the field, he has no poker face towards anyone he is suspicious about. If I were in this character's presence, I would be very uncomfortable because he looks like he's studying you and he looks like he might shoot you.

I think the movie tries to chase after moments. Clooney either overreacts or underacts depending on the mood the director is trying to convey. I never felt like I was in the movie because the movie as a whole seems too aware of itself. I could almost hear the director's instructions in every scene. "" Okay George, you're a hit man. Act paranoid here. Okay you just killed an innocent girl. Mope about it while your peer scorns you."" It all has a very mechanical cause and effect impression. Nothing feels organic in this film.

This detached kind of approach plays a big role in why the movie drags, because you never feel like you're invested in the characters so much as watching actors just play their respective parts. "" You shoot this person. Let's have some provocative nudity here. Lets throw in a twist here. You react like this. She will react like that.""  The whole movie plays on that level. The story is interesting on a number of fronts, but the execution is uninspired and lacking the kind of attention to character development that could have made this film a measurably better experience.",1505260800,,2379,4.512761020881671

Four and a half STEALTY Stars. In the Euro-drama The American, Oscar-winner George Clooney stars as Jack, a ruthless, professional criminal living quietly in an Italian town. Jack has strict standards to follow.

While I do enjoy most George Clooney acting, this wasn't a winner for me.  I think that the story line was good and I feel like the message they were trying to attempt throughout was a very interesting and engaging one.  Unfortunately, the movie in general was pretty sleepy and dry.

The movie started off with a bang, and we were very interested.  But we found that toward the end we were mostly forcing ourselves to finish so we could say that we completed the entire thing.  The acting was good and there were a few action scenes that were very good.  I am not sure if it was just the balance of the production or if it is our own issue, it was just not something that grabbed us.

In fact, I barely moved at all. I was fascinated and completely into it. George Clooney perfectly portrays a frightened, exhausted assassin who realizes that he wants nothing to do with that life anymore, but that's not a simple thing; one doesn't just get to walk away. This is NOT an action film. It's a quiet, yet tense drama; a character study of a very sad and incredibly lonely man, crushed by guilt, ruminating on past actions and constantly looking over his shoulder. His sadness and his grim, focused paranoia is etched on his face always. He's tired and scared and emotionally vulnerable and it shows. He desperately wants to experience and have love and safety. No, this is not, in any way, a romantic film, so don't worry about that. There are some short, violent scenes but they're not terribly graphic and they're done very quietly and very well. It does deserve the R rating but there's not gory violence. The F-Bomb is dropped several times but I rarely notice bad language anymore, so it doesn't bother me as it bothers some. There is some nudity. There's not a lot of dialogue, but it's not necessary for this story and I think any more would have been a detriment to the way it's told. To enjoy this film, you have to be willing to go with it and think about it. The American is absolutely worth the time and a little effort.",1455926400,,1519,4.487364620938628

4288208,3,B0049EVR32,"The American
 This ennui burdened film should be called Il Americano.  It is made by Europeans for Europeans, mostly in Italy in winter by director Anton Corbijn, a very successful Dutch maker of rock videos.  This film will be rated as an artistic success perhaps, in Europe, but is not likely to become a commercial success in America.  Powerful screen presence George Clooney is not allowed to unleash his talent until the final moment of the film, and by then it is too late.  Good for you George for taking an artistic chance, unless you just wanted a payday while vacationing at your beautiful home in Italy.
 Whats wrong with this film?  When the film begins we do not know the true name of the main player.  We do not know for whom he works. We do not know who is trying to kill him or why. We do know that he is a master craftsman at the killing trade, a heartless, remorseless death for hire kind of guy.  Right away, we are prevented from that emotional bond with the protagonist that is so important in film by his casual, brutal murder of his lover.  We presume she is murdered by the kind of just in case carefulness that allows a hit man to reach retirement age.  When the film ends, we do not know his true name or who he works for or who is trying to kill him or why. To the audience, it seems random. In between there are long shots of Italy in winter as he drives from place to place.  That is not a good use of film.  Instead of action or intrigue, we are given frequent doses of all wraps off nudity and graphic sex between the hit man and his new love interest, a beautiful Italian prostitute.  While diverting, it does very little to advance the tale.  Thats how they do it in Europe.  Boredom and sex seem to be the hallmarks of a dying civilization.
 Whats right with the film?  There is a relationship between the hit man and the local Italian priest that is very good, and the last minute of the film where Clooney very quietly acts his sox off.  Attractive naked women are good in a general way but don't improve the overall slow, boring slide of the film.
 The properly R rated film-extreme nudity, graphic sex, several fairly antiseptic killings-runs an hour and 45 minutes.  It managed to reach number one this weekend in a tough part of the year.  We can give it only two saw blades.  For a really good hit man and whore movie, rent Payback with Mel Gibson and Maria Bello.",1437264000,,2405,4.331096196868009

It was like a cerebral, colorful travelogue of the Italian countryside with a subplot of an ex assassin just trying to enjoy the rest of his life without his past coming back to haunt him.  AND IT DOES!!!  The book was an incredibly, enjoyable read!  NOW!!  The MOVIE is ssoooomewhat like the book, but then, what movie is!!! The American gets real close to the narrative making the subplot the plot and filming it in the Italian countryside towns of Castel del Monte, Sulmona, Castelvecchio Calvisio, Calascio and Campo Imperatore in the Province of L'Aquila (Abruzzo); in Rome, and in stersund, Jmtland and other locations.  Which helped make up for what was not included from the book. The pace moves at a slow boil, but the attempts on George Clooney's life and the beautiful women keep things compelling and interesting as he is tasked with creating a weapon for a buyer in his down time.

4288248,3,B0049EVR32,"This would have been a 5 star film 40 or 50 years ago. Today, from the doomed assassin trope to the preist as foil to the tired butterfly-as-symbol-of-character-transforming motif, there's simply nothing original about it. It's an American film with  aspirations of European sophistication that fails because it merely imitates.

I also had a problem with the protagonist killing his girl in the first ten minutes. This made it very difficult to care about what happened to him. There were a couple of flashbacks to the event, but for the killing to work in the film, we needed to see it weigh much more heavily on the protagonist's conscience than it did.

The film is well done technically, and that does makes it a pleasure to watch. The direction, cinematography, art direction, editing, and sound are all first rate. The pacing is a refreshing change from most American thrillers.

4288282,3,B0049EVR32,"Who doesnt love George Clooney? Hes normally involved in no fewer than two major
projects each year (and each one usually very good). Last year, he was in three films: Up in the
Air (for which he was nominated for an Academy Award) as well as Fantastic Mr. Fox and
The Men Who Stare at Goats, and throw in a guest appearance in the television drama ER
where he had a recurring role early in his career.
In The American, Clooney plays Jack, an assassin who is reaching the end of an illustrious
career. After a botched job in Sweden, which opens the film, Jack escapes to Italy and awaits
instructions for his next job. He receives his assignment and tells his boss he is making this one
his last. During his stay, Jack begins seeing Clara (played by Italian actress Violante Placido),
one of the towns prostitutes, and he is befriended by local priest, Father Benedetto (played by
veteran Italian actor Paolo Bonacelli). Dutch actress Thekla Reuten plays Mathilde, the woman
responsible for presenting Jack with his new assignment.
The cast in this film is one of the best, truly international ensembles seen from Hollywood in
recent years. Much credit goes to Dutch director Anton Corbijn for keeping the flavor of this
film authentic and certainly Euro-centric. Much of Corbijns work previous to this was in
musical documentaries and music videos, and the style of this film no doubt pulls from his
skills honed during those projects. The film is beautifully shot and masterfully edited. Clooney
is unusually muted in this film, but its fitting to his character and he plays it well.
Despite all of this high praise, by the end of the film you're questioning motivation and
wondering who was doing what to whom! Sure, Jack is an assassin, and certainly we dont
expect all of the details surrounding his work (and surely what he considers to be his last
assignment) to be anything but covert. What should never be covert is a characters motivation.
Im all in favor of plot twists, but only ones where the audience has a great big ah-ha moment
(not a scratch-your-head-wha?? moment). This detracts substantially from all the films good
qualities.

4288316,5,B0049EVR32,"I read a number of reviews of this film before I watched it myself, so I knew upfront what I was getting into. And other reviewers are correct: 'The American' is not a thriller. Or if it is, it's certainly not the traditional kind. With more emphasis on suspense and subtlety than big-budget effects and edge-of-the-seat chases, one might expect the film to be boring. But Clooney's spectacularly understated performance, masterfully captured by director Anton Corbijn's long close-ups, make even moments of complete inactivity absolutely riveting.

If it means anything, this is the first film I've ever thought worth the cost of purchasing in Blu-ray. (Granted, at the time of writing, that cost was $6.00but that's more a comment on my cheapness than the film's value.) Corbijn's photographic sensibilities make the extra visual quality a must, and there are certain shots of the wide-open Italian landscape that are apt to leave appreciative viewers breathless. The included special features, while not extensive, were certainly enjoyable, and provided interesting insights into the director's process, Clooney's acting, and the areas where the film was shot.

4288320,4,B0049EVR32,"When a writer plots a story, they should write down the key plot elements and make trebly sure that these are communicated to the viewer, listener or reader with one hundred per cent comprehension.

For example the bibilical Gospels tell the story of this guy who died and returned to life. The two key plot elements are that Jesus must be shown to have died beyond all doubt and that he must be shown to have been alive three days later. The gospel writers do a pretty good job of establishing these two key plot elements.

In ""The American"" the single most important plot element is that Jack has modified the rifle he sells to Mathilde. The rules of drama necessitate that this be kept as a surprise but once it is revealed, it must be REVEALED. You should hear everyone in the audience saying ""Ohhh! now I see!""

Instead, the audience is left wondering, what the HECK has just happened now? It takes a good minute for the penny to drop.

Italians are conceived in basic stereotypes: the knowing local priest, moody and villianous looking young men on the edge of crime, drop dead gorgeous girls who just happen to be sluts working in a local brothel....yes the smallish Italian hilltop village supports that....and the list goes on. The aerial shots of car on snaking roads. The butterfly metaphor (metaphor for what?) the all too frequent shots of female flesh to tittilate some viewers whose brains must have gone to sleep. And the unexplained...keep a big gap at the end.

Compared with films like The Hit (Terence Stamp/John Hurt) or The Jackal, even The Limey again with Stamp, this is rubbish. Clooney portrays a moron who waddles his way through the film which suggests he is as uncomfortable as the audience. In solo scenes - a certain edgy tension is conveyed - but the jury is out on Clooney's acting skills: when it's just him in the scene or in front of the camera nothing is done to give any sense of character. Compare that with say, Lino Ventura in La Bon Annee.

Oh, and if you want to see real cinematographic genius, taste, skill and great editing in the use of a butterfly metaphor at the end of a film...look at the last 3 minutes of Elvira Madigan. I know they are entirely different types of project, but on every level one is a work of art and this is bog roll. That's how bad I feel about The American.

4288328,4,B0049EVR32,"Many have already reviewed this film but I felt the need to put my two cents in because this is much better than most might have you believe.

Here's the scoop. Jack (George Clooney) is an intelligence operator/hit man who escapes a hit put on him. But his blown cover has caused him to kill the woman he was with. A woman he was beginning to care for. He heads to Italy where he's given an assignment to fabricate a rifle for someone else's hit. As he mixes with the locals and examines his life he finds himself at a very dangerous juncture.

This film failed in the marketing. It was such that most probably figured this was a Bourne type flick. It's anything but. This is about a man who deals death but wants to experience life. He wants to sleep peacefully and walk around without looking over his shoulder. As he walks through the narrow, high-walled streets of the town, he looks like a rat trapped in a maze. He wants to fall in love but can't risk it so he makes certain that when he visits the local brothel, he always gets the same girl. That's as close as he can come. He's gentle at heart. He has a thing for butterflies. He reads about them and has one tattooed on his back. As all the locals refer to him as ""The American"" he's as much an outsider in life as he is an outsider in the country. Many felt that there were long stretches of the movie where nothing happened. To me there wasn't a wasted scene to be found. Every expression, gesture or word was well thought out. Clooney does a great job in the role. When you see him building the gun he's very comfortable with it. It were as though he'd done it a thousand times before.

Great attention is paid to the village and landscapes. It depicts the beauty Clooney wants to find in his life. The editing is seamless and the music well underscores what's happening on the screen. See this movie. Just do not be in an antsy mood when you're watching it. This isn't chugging a bottle of beer. It's sipping a fine cognac.",1390521600,2,1987,4.293333333333333

4288342,3,B0049EVR32,"I'm fascinated by assassins, and watch every movie in this genre that I come across.  The gorgeous locations in Italy and Sweden and the beautiful cinematography whetted my appetite and made me want to love this film, but the icy, terse portrayal of the American was like a door slammed in my face.  What I wanted to see was his interior: how did he become what he is, and what drives his choices?  But he was like a man in a dream when he wasn't in an action sequence, skilled and sensual but unconscious of himself and not in control of the unfolding of his fate.  In a way this was interesting: here is a person with extremely high physical intelligence but almost no emotional intelligence, and the result of this is a paradox: a person who has the power to win almost any life-or-death conflict in which he finds himself (and he is almost always on the defensive, surviving with the proficiency of a finely-honed automaton much like the weapons that he builds) but who, though perfect in all the details, finds himself powerless with regard to controlling the grand scope of his life.

In a trope that verges on the nauseatingly cliche, the killer's weakness is love, which he unwillingly finds when it sneaks up on him through purchased sex.  The masculine paranoia of this point of view is so thoroughly established in our culture that the movie makes no attempt to justify it with the reality of the American's relationships.  We are supposed to accept that a man like him can't have love, and that if he chooses it, one of the lovers is doomed.  We know that's because love introduces chaos into his tightly-controlled, almost robotic life, and puts him at the mercy of something that he can't control: but the movie does a poor job of proving this to the audience through the action, dialogue or plot.  We're merely supposed to accept our prejudice that for men of action, depth of feeling is poison.  I found this very disappointing.  For those of us who question this premise, the movie doesn't make much sense.

The whole thing is almost like running around in the psyche of a paranoid man: other people are hangers on which to drape his projections.  Thus the love interest is nothing but beauty and sensuality, not really a person in her own right; his employer is as irrationally treacherous as a Freudian father figure, but we never understand why he's doing what he does; his friend is senselessly kind and nonjudgmental, an archetype of mercy and potential redemption who doesn't seem to really have his own needs.  Why do any of these people feel the way they do about the American?  We never find out.  I think we are meant to care about him automatically and identify with those who love him, but I did not care about him and found their sincere warmth perplexing.  These are people whose professions (elderly priest, prostitute) should have made them astute and cynical judges of character, but they let this monster past all their boundaries.  Why would they do that?  Because they're poorly-created characters, mere vehicles for the unfolding of the hitman's angst: they are mirrors in which he sees himself, and the man he presumably begins to wish he could become.

What I like about this though is that a killer probably does see the world this way.  The ultimate shallowness of this movie fits his emotionally-stunted point of view.  What I don't like about this is that it's hard to tell whether this is a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmaker, or whether he's equally shallow, thus making this movie the pretentious failure it felt like upon first viewing.",1386633600,,3596,4.692675159235669
4288343,4,B0049EVR32,"The American is a telling film with many large flaws, but its real value lies in the subtlety of expression both present and missing in the life of George Clooney's character. First of all,  the hit sequences in Italy are preposterous, especially within the confines of a small village. Secondly, a real hit man would have guessed the gun's manufacture right off the bat, and gone after his boss immediately. Thirdly, if the viewer wants action or the 'ascendent' Mr. Clooney, watch something else. Clooney did a good job in this film portraying an essentially empty man finally facing the utter failure, futility and error of his craft. The contrast with his prostitute companion, by far the freshest most beautiful prostitute imaginable, cuts into Clooney's dour cynicism and self-contempt, which is the inevitable moral result of his trade. In the end it is her love that redeems him as a man and as a human being, who at one point paid for her pleasure, and then discovered the greater pleasure he gained just by being with her, i.e., love crept back into his gray soul. As the film concludes his character gets grayer and grayer, a fitting testament to the emptiness of his life. And in the end he pays the final price all great moral error entails--full accountability. Further, in metaphor, this film is about what America and the American ""civilization' has finally devolved into. In this context, this film offers much more than just meets the eye.",1386288000,3,1457,4.85140562248996

4288347,5,B0049EVR32,"Like a few of the best films of the 70's some of which were set in Italy and France, some of them American, some Italian, and some French, this Italian and American production of ""The American"" is perfectly paced, and the tone and cadences evoke emotional subtleties that keep the audience poised between the film's orchestrated mixture of genres--suspense, intrigue, romance, and espionage. Feeling and thought are centered by this film, which sets out primarily to serve those two ideals, much more so than merely to entertain, as do, say, any one of Tom Clancy's numbingly action packed over the top espionage novels, books which lend themselves to translation into numbingly action packed 'movies'. Writer Martin Booth, author of ""A Very Private Gentleman""' the novel upon which ""The American"" was based, is a far more thoughtful writer than Clancy ever sought to be. Thus, ""The American"" cleaves to feeling and thought to successfully beat out patriotism and testosterone.

This it does through its use of time, silence, and pacing. Each scene, most of them played at a languid pace in medium to long takes, exacts the perfect amount of time necessary to reinforce the film's core thoughtfulness (or maybe I should more accurately say 'mindfulness') with pacing and duration determined by the emotional weight of what is happening within each scene: some scenes are long takes, full of silence (as when 'Mr. Butterfly"" sits in cafes reading newspapers or sits alone in his bungalow demonstrating his characteristic suffering solitude--machining and drilling his 'artisan's' gun and bullets to sell to another assassin); some scenes however have the feel of being suddenly cut off in mid stride (as when the priest who befriends him seeks a confession from Butterfly, but ends up confessing himself instead, and then challenges Butterfly with the question, left unanswered, ""What do YOU have?"" As Butterfly looks away in profile, seemingly pained by the question, the scene suddenly cuts, at precisely the right moment).

This is  reminiscent of the works of 70's American filmmakers like Arthur Penn, Peter Bogdanovich, and William Friedkin, or of Polish director Roman Polanski or French director Jean Luc Goddard, all of whom used drastic discontinuity in their narratives and mise-en-scenes. Overall, the brooding, silence-filled sequences achieve the aim of emotional tension, as in Michelangelo Antonioni's films; fitting for a narrative set in Italy as is ""The American.""

What is most impressive about director Anton Corbijn's and screenwriter Rowan Joffe's work here though, is a surprising tenderness and poignancy achieved through the subplot of Butterfly's love affair with a prostitute. Let's face it, this is a plot point laden with the baggage of narrative cliche--the hooker with a heart of gold and the killer who yearns to find love with her! Yet, a film of such exact emotional clarity and visual grace can and does carry the cliche off by investing it with the one sure fire method of making us care: it's the characters--the people in this cliche situation that we either care about or don't.

Thanks to the lost, yearning, and vulnerable edge that George Clooney brings to Butterfly and that Violante Placido brings to the prostitute character, and thanks to the way the two of them fit so surely into each other's silences, each other's emotional desire, and into each other's arms, bumbling their way past each other's defenses, we DO care. Love is the most ancient theme of all human drama and narrative, and redemptive love, well, that's the dream of all human dreams. We wish for these characters to transcend cliche, to escape their former lives, to be redeemed.

Thanks to the tenderness that dialogue, cinematography, acting, and mise-en-scene evoke whenever these two are together, the film does manage to transcend the mundane elements of plot.

Corbijn's use of and focus upon Clooney's aging body also, is an effective means of pulling us, through empathy, into the suspense, the tension, and the physical risk as well as emotional risk Butterfly is going through. The camera work and editing depend upon  cold light, monochromatic color schemes, shadow, and the claustrophobic spaces of a small Italian village contrasted to the periodic bursts of monumental open spaces, of mountains in the background (probably the Italian Alps) when Butterfly drives along the rural roads between towns. In the cold, monochromatic interiors George Clooney's skin looks pallid, corpse-like. His lover is lit by a lurid red light filter, an almost tongue-in-cheek visual pun (she is in a 'red light district' if such a small rural village can be said to have such). Her body, like Butterfly's, is therefore a deadened mat upon which social entrapment is projected. The contrast is quick to come: when they begin to date, they venture out together into ecstatic sunlight and into cafes and patisseries, and their bodies take on the life and color of a full spectrum. Their love for one another literally raises them from the dead, visually.

Thoughtful writing and direction imply a plethora of unspoken narrative details and back story (the vaguely military tattoos on Butterfly's aging skin, the implication that his fatigue has come after a long multinational career as a murderer, and the flashbacks to the murder he commits at the film's start, a murder that has burdened him with guilt). All of which deepen the humanity of this portrayal of a killer who has grown old and tired of solitude and violence. This very same theme was expertly carried off a few years back by David Cronenberg in his violence diptych, ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises,"" films which presented a character similar to Butterfly: a killer whose past entraps him but who is so thoroughly desperate to escape it that he practically wills the redemption he seeks, driven by both romantic and familial love.

Some critics have expressed disdain for ""The American"" both because of the cliche elements and because of the quality it displays of imbalance, incompleteness, and uneven narrative momentum, I would argue however that the film's cliches are a means to a thematic end well realized (while the film's tragic ending kills any taint of sentimentality the narrative might have been marred by). ""The American""'s unevenness, the imbalance of its narrative, keep us on edge enough to care about these doomed characters. Penn, Bogdanovitch, Friedkin, and Polanski all presented cinema audiences with exactly the same sort of cinema of complexity transcending mundane mass market Hollywood genres such as the thriller, intrigue, or espionage--complexity achieved through characterization, silence,  mise-en-scene, and emotion rather than action and dialogue. ""The American"" descends from this tradition of a cinema of feeling and thought.",1385683200,3,6848,5.210717529518619

4288390,4,B0049EVR32,"Have you seen ""The American"" with George Clooney? Confused by butterflies and rifles? It's a beautifully filmed movie...majestic mountains, snow scenes, hilltop villages. Set in Sweden in the early scenes but shifting to a medieval village in the hill country of Northern Italy for the remainder of the film. Although the critics say the only thing American about the film is the title and Mr. Clooney, they are rating the movie three out of five stars probably for the cinematography.

The film is an adaptation of the 1990 book by British writer Martin Booth (1944-2004)) entitled A VERY PRIVATE GENTLEMAN: the book explains all. Booth's tale is a character study about a loner who is no ""gentleman"": it is also a tragedy following events in the life of a gunsmith who sells his services to assassins. The style is partly in the form of classic confessional writing, as the protagonist seeks to explain the relevance of his choice of profession. The time of the story seems to be late 20th century, more or less similar to the year of publication. The story is written in the first-person narrative from the point of view of the main character, who is known as Edmund or Signor Farfalla.

There are only three major characters in both media (perfectly cast in the film especially George Clooney as Farfalla):

....Signor Farfalla ""Mr. Butterfly"" is a middle-aged man from a country where English is spoken as a first language. He is loner who paints miniatures of butterflies and has traveled to the area to capture a unque native specimen. He is also a ""shadow-dweller,"" a technical weapons expert who creates and supplies tools for high-level assassins. He is a lecturer of sorts in the novel, who is not apologetic about his profession: he sees the need for people who kill to change the world for the better. In the film, Farfalla is consumed by a feeling of doom over the use of his weapons...and vows that he will retire after finishing the current product.

...Father Bendetto is the local Catholic priest in the Italian village. He befriends Farfalla, and they discover a common interest in wine, food, and discussion and debate.

...Clara is a young Italian student. She meets Farfalla when he becomes her regular customer in the local bordello.

THE AMERICAN is a movie that will view better after reading the book! Even reading the reviews of the book will enlightened you. The main differences between the novel and the film are the aesthetic tone and the ending. Both endings are satisfactory...but only after reading the novel and viewing the film adaption...can one choose a favorite...

Too bad about the story.

There's a mammoth plot twisting head scratcher not even 5 minutes in which never gets answered in the movie. There's a couple in the middle, and three at the end. These are not small things which don't make sense.  They're ""the movie turns on this point"" kinds of dilemmas for the viewers.

Considering the long silences and very small amount of dialogue, that's quite a collection of plot twists which don't make sense to cram into a movie.

If you can not appreciate slow films, this one may not be for you. This will certainly make you appreciate the true passion behind film aspects and the power of silence. I had seen this 3 or 4 times before buying it. It is one one of my all time favorite George Clooney films. There is very little speaking in this film, not many characters, and it ALMOST seems to drag on with a few things. I say almost, because it is necessary, for the films emotion, to draw out the way it does. You get to see so much emotion behind the things going on with the main character and what he is going through trying to get out of the business. I am rather disappointed that he dies in the end. I was rooting for him to get out and have a good life with his love interest. Plus, that would leave the door open for a sequel. Never the less, it is a truly BRILLIANT film.

One of the opening sequences is George Clooney's character shooting his friend and lover in the back - you don't often see a movie star shooting a woman in the back, so I liked that the film made it crystal clear from the beginning that the George Clooney character was doomed.  Now it's coming back to me, I think it's a morality tale, live by the sword, die by the sword, at the end, the lead had plenty of money and a beautiful woman who loved him and he died just as a decent life was within his reach.  So, though I disliked the story (I hated the violence against the woman character at the story's beginning and it colored the entire story for me in a negative way), I think it was told well, i.e., told within a morality frame Americans like me like.  In real life, with this scenario, the lead would have survived and lived to a ripe old age with many children and grandchildren surrounding him; only in film stories do villains sometimes get their comeuppance.  In the real world they seem to live well and prosper, but we audiences so like our illusions, the simple rules many of us were raised with - do not lie, or cheat or steal, do onto others as you would have them do onto you.

No, here you will not see Clooney shooting out any windows and then jumping through them. The pacing is slow, but persistently tense. The filmmakers and actors have managed to pull off an exciting espionage thriller without having to rely on the over-saturation of action sequences.

4288468,5,B0049EVR32,"George Clooney is one of our best American actors. I like to see him taking risks by working with a European director (Anton Corbijn), who is from the Netherlands. I watch films by European directors like Michael Haneke, an Austrian director who has made a number of films that are unlike any that are made in the U.S. Haneke won two Academy Award nominations in 2009 for his German language film The White Ribbon. This year his French language film Amour has been nominated for best foreign language film.
American audiences seem to prefer films that have happy endings. That is not a requirement for European audiences.
I don't know much about Corbijn, but I noted that his 2008 DVD Control received a rating of 4 1/2 stars on Amazon, so I ordered it and a DVD of the Director's Series for Corbijn to find out what he has done so far.
I was surprised at the low rankings here for The American. The beautiful shots of the Italian hill country alone were worth a higher ranking. I just finished watching Clooney in Syriana and Out of Sight. I think The American is better than either of these films.",1359676800,2,1099,4.527638190954774
4288469,5,B0049EVR32,"The entire drama of this film rests on two words, ""Mr. Butterfly."" We must be vigilant to realize that once, and only once, they are spoken by the wrong person. They cause the entire film and all of its relationships to rotate. I felt exaltation at this detail. It is so rare to see a film this carefully crafted, this patiently assembled like a weapon, that when the word comes it strikes like a clap of thunder. A lesser film would have underscored it with a shock chord, punctuated it with a sudden zoom, or cut to a shocked close up. ""The American"" is too cool to do that. Too Zen, if you will.

""The American"" allows George Clooney to play a man as starkly defined as a samurai. His fatal flaw, as it must be for any samurai, is love. Other than that, the American is perfect: Sealed, impervious and expert, with a focus so narrow it is defined only by his skills and his master. Here is a gripping film with the focus of a Japanese drama, an impenetrable character to equal Alain Delon's in ""Le Samourai,"" by Jean-Pierre Melville.

Clooney plays a character named Jack, or perhaps Edward. He is one of those people who can assemble mechanical parts by feel and instinct, so inborn is his skill. His job is creating specialized weapons for specialized murders. He works for Pavel (Johan Leysen, who looks like Scott Glenn left to dry in the sun). Actually, we might say he ""serves"" Pavel, because he accepts his commands without question, giving him a samurai's loyalty.

Pavel assigns him a job. It involves meeting a woman named Mathilde (Thekla Reuten) in Italy. They meet in a public place, where she carries a paper folded under her arm--the classic tell in spy movies. Their conversation begins with one word: ""Range?"" It involves only the specifications of the desired weapon. No discussion of purpose, cost, anything.

He thinks to find a room in a small Italian hilltop village, but it doesn't feel right. He finds another. We know from the film's shocking opening scene that people want to kill him. In the second village, he meets the fleshy local priest, Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli). Through him he meets the local mechanic, walks into his shop, and finds all the parts he needs to build a custom silencer.

In the village he also finds a whore, Clara (Violante Placido), who works in a bordello we are surprised to find such a village can support. Jack or Edward lives alone, does push-ups, drinks coffee in cafes, assembles the weapon. And so on. His telephone conversations with Pavel are terse. He finds people beginning to follow him and try to kill him.
The director is a Dutchman named Anton Corbijn, known to me for ""Control"" (2007), the story of Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division, a suicide at 23. Corbin has otherwise made mostly music videos. Here he paints an idyllic Italian countryside as lyrical as his dialogue is taciturn. There is not a wrong shot. Every performance is tightly controlled. Clooney is in complete command of his effect. He sometimes seems to be chewing a very small piece of gum, or perhaps his tongue.

His weakness is love. Clara, the prostitute, should not be trusted. We sense he uses prostitutes because he made a mistake in the relationship that opens the film. In his business he cannot trust anybody. But perhaps Clara is different. Do not assume from what I've written that she isn't different. It is very possible. The film ends like a clockwork mechanism arriving at its final, clarifying tick.

It did not use brass bands or flashing lights to make its points. It was subtle, quiet, and meticulous -- just like its protagonist. Some say it was slow but I thought that it was more inevitable. Like water rolling downhill everything followed it's course, like fate.
If you expect an action movie you will be disappointed. It is a character study of a man who is caught in current of all the choices he has made and is seeking a way out. A man no longer at the top of his form in a game where there is only one mistake per player. A man whose greatest flaw is simply that he has become lonely.

The story follows a professional hit-man when he's hired for a job by a young attractive woman.
If a movie wants to capture my attention, there has to be a really good story, even a decent story, or an average story.  I'm not looking for ""Lord of the Rings"" in every story.  I'm just looking for something that catches my interest.  This movie, did not do that.  In fact, the most interesting character was The Priest and he, unfortunately, was NOT the main character.
And it didn't bother me that he was a ""hit-man"", which would have been a personal taste issue with the story.  Okay, he's a hit-man.  Fine.  Now show me something about him that makes him interesting, that makes me be interested in his story.  There was nothing there.  He was like a dead character.  Where are his quirks?  His insecurities?  Where is the hint of his back story?  Where is his heart?  Maybe he's out for revenge?  But give me something, a REASON to want to watch the rest of the movie.

The 100+ minute  film contains about 15 minutes of unexciting actual story, most of the rest being closeups of Jack (Clooney) expressionlessly staring out a window/driving a car/walking in the village. He has maybe four combined minutes of blankly-delivered dialogue, a mere fraction of the time dedicated to Clara's perpetually exposed... and far more lively... breasts.

To reinforce the film's bland monotony, most of it transpires in drab, nearly monochromatic settings and flat directionless light. I don't even remember there being any musical score (after watching it last night, and I'm not about to suffer through it again to doublecheck) except for some menacing chords near the end.

""Old West showdown""??? Gimme a break. He turns around and shoots the guy. And the cheesy symbolism just before ending credits roll is downright embarrassing. It's all so predictable; the only unexpected scene was the first many-minutes-long scrutiny of the nude Clara...kind of awkward when you're watching it with your wife.",1350777600,5,1132,5.307262569832402
4288475,3,B0049EVR32,"`The American' casts George Clooney as Jack, a gunman for hire whose job forces him to live a largely solitary life, but when he is attacked by Swedish hitmen, Jack flees to a small town in Italy, where he takes on the job of building a custom rifle for a mysterious hit-woman, but worlds collide when he finds himself attracted to a local prostitute and the people who are after him haven't given up yet.

`The American' is more of a slow-paced suspense thriller and director Anton Corbijn seems to enjoy taking his time to build things up. It's the kind of film that asks for your patience while it develops it's plot threads, but I found the end result really uneven; some parts were just tight with tension, while others just sort of plodded along, so it was really difficult to get into the whole movie. George Clooney was great, though, as Jack and portraying the multiple facets of his character; from a cold, emotionless hitman to a troubled soul looking to escape his `profession' and loneliness. Violante Placido is incredibly beautiful as Jack's love interest, Clara, and adds a lot of strength to the role. Thekla Reuten and Johan Leysen put in good turns as the villains of the piece while Paolo Bonacelli is the old priest who helps Jack find his way.

4288478,5,B0049EVR32,"This is a brilliant movie. Everything is perfect, but some aspects stand out.

First, the astonishing performance of George Clooney. ""The American"" shows his extraordinary talent much better than the movies usually associated with him (like ""Ocean's Eleven"" and even ""The Good German"").

Second, the fact that ""The American"" has three female leads played by European actresses Irina Bj&ouml;rklund, Violante Placido, and Thekla Reuten. The first one is given very little screen time due to the nature of the story, but her character and what happens to it is crucial for the rest of the movie. All three actresses are excellent in their roles, and, as an extra benefit, they are all beautiful in rather non-trivial, at least for the American audience, ways.

Movies with three female characters playing pivotal roles in the story are rather rare for the big USA studios productions (in contrast, ""The American"" is produced by fairly independent ""Focus features""). All too often we see an otherwise good or even great movie with female characters serving only a decorative role or totally absent (love stories excluding, naturally). As a rare exception, John Frankenheimer and David Mamet realized the need of a female lead even in an action-thriller and added such a character to the original story and the original script. The result is ""Ronin"" (in which the female lead is played by Natascha McElhone), another perfect movie.

Third, the superb cinematography and the Italian beautiful scenery. Italian scenery is another character in the movie. In order to fully appreciate this, one should watch the Blu-ray (not the DVD) version.

And, finally, the directing by Anton Corbijn, who come to director's chair very late after achieving fame as a photographer (in particular and may be foremost, as a photographer of such music bands as U2, Metallica, Depeche Mode), is outstanding and refreshing.

""The American"" is an action-thriller, a character drama, and an art house film. This may be too much to swallow for many viewers, and, apparently, many are concluding that it is neither. Inability to put a genre label on it leads to some discomfort (but not necessarily to a complete rejection). An audience with precooked assumptions about what a thriller or an art house film is ought to be will be disappointed. But an action-thriller does not need to be like ""Die Hard"" (any of the installments), and an art house film does not need to be ""Sundance-like"".  Jean-Pierre Melville's classics ""Le samoura"" showed this already in 1967. ""The American"" is often compared to it in order to understand the movie, although Anton Corbijn, apparently, took more motivation from spaghetti-westerns of Sergio Leone (directly referenced to in ""The American"").

If you are tolerant to more than one type of movies, you can enjoy ""The American"" either as an action-thriller, or as a character drama, or as an art house film. If you are sufficiently mature and open-minded to appreciate all genres (the art house fans need to realize that the art house is also a genre, and not a title of nobility), you will be able to appreciate this movie to the full extent.

The usual complaint about ""The American"" is that it is slow and boring. It is indeed slow, but this slow narrative is packed with subtle details, changes of mood, and, of course, the beautiful scenery, which underscores mostly unspoken thoughts of main characters. It is boring only if you don't pay attention to all this. Another complaint is that this movie is a European movie. It is. Why not to try to watch and enjoy a European movie with George Clooney?

The most obvious reasons to see ""The American"" are George Clooney, three beautiful actresses, cool characters, beauty of the cinematography, and, of course, the enigmatic story. In addition there is a good chance that you will recognize a masterpiece in it.",1346284800,6,3866,5.017160686427457

It's a quiet, slow paced homage to Italian cinema, and a character study of a lonely assassin. As a suspense thriller, it has its moments, but I wouldn't say they were great. George Clooney was pretty good as Jack. Not his best performance, but it didn't require much from him to begin with.

4288537,2,B0049EVR32,"Last night's bargain rack movie was ""The American"" DVD which I picked up at a nearby Ross Store. It starred George Clooney as, you guessed it, the American. The story took place in Sweden (a little bit) and Italy (mostly) and the filming was excellent. This part of italy was just beautiful, and quite picturesque and the photographers really picked it up. By and large, the acting was quite good, although there wasn't much in the way of character development with any of the people. The women were the best in this respect. The men were silent types with a cold and cruel personas.

As to the story, it was an action movie without much action. The story had Clooney as some type of assassin (never really specified as to why) with a stone-faced man of few words as a distant accomplice. Their main contacts were through extremely limited phone conversations. Clooney was in on a botched job in Sweden, in which he cruelly and cold-bloodedly murdered his lady friend, and he was whisked off to Italy until the heat died down. Well, in Italy, he started to meet more rather nice women and worked on a high-tech assassination weapon. Too much of the movie was devoted to his work, I might add. You're looking for action? Well it never really unfolded, so I hope you're satisfied with a smattering of limited dialog. The movie was a tour of the largely empty streets of this charming Italian village and visits to their largely empty shops. Clooney portrayed an emotionless stone-faced killer on assignment, except the assignment was never specified. Oh yes, a number of guys wanted him dead, including one from Sweden. Ho-humm. If you want a one-word review, the word boring comes to mind but the photography was good enough to hold your attention.

4288539,4,B0049EVR32,"Hitting the bricks is not part of this 'slow to the fire' thriller/romantic film ""The American"". It is about an assassin going through redemption in a quiet Italian town (Castel del Monte) while making friends with a priest and then making love to a beautiful prostitute (Clara, played by Violante Placido). Going into battle may seem like fun but to our hero Jack the gunsmith (played to-the-bone by George Clooney), it is not very high on his list. He has just killed his lover Ingrid (played by Irina Bj&ouml;rklund), and has to live with his conscience. Our empathy may be tied to his `soul searching', as we do not understand why he had to kill defenseless Ingrid. He is thrown into the abyss of guilt and remorse. The plot thickens.

Jack wants out of the business; he tells his boss that he is going into seclusion and will not return to his profession of `killing for a price'. By doing so, Jack brings the wrath of the rejected employer down on himself. He knows this. He assumes another identity. He confides to the local priest (played by Paolo Bonacelli), ""I don't think God's very interested in me, Father."" He even seeks to be cleansed of his guilt by sleeping with our `Mary Magdalene' heroine. Jack will now die to protect Clara from any harm; he is her bodyguard and lover.

He has changed the course of his life through her influence upon him. In all regards, Clooney is cool, reserved, quiet, deliberate, methodical, and tender with the women characters from start to finish. He is even protective of a woman assassin (Mathilde, played by Thekla Reuten), who is sent to kill him. Mercifully, he gives her every chance to back away and turn down the contract on his life. He wants her life (Mathilde) to be spared as well. He has a conscience now, and we empathize with him - not as a cold-bloodied killer but as a changed man from within. He has 'discovered' what matters most to him as a man of conscience.

These dramatic ironies - the sensitive caring side to our assassin-turned-hero toward three highly feminine women (with completely different personnas) and the precise way he builds a Ruger Mini-14 suppressor for the gun meant to be used against him - allow us as an audience to enjoy an Italian-American remake of ""Le Samourai"" (French, 1967, stars Alain Delon as the assassin in a similar, redemptive plot; also defending a woman) and ""Sumarai I, II, and III"" (Japanese, stars Tishuro Mifune as the moralistic 'master swordsman' defending honor and women with his life). Clooney works well with women in strong roles, and this elevates the film substantially. All unities adhered to.

This is a very mellow movie, so if you are expecting an action movie, look another direction and watch Die Hard, Rambo or something. You are not going to get 2 million bullets a minute on this movie!!!

THE AMERICAN is about an assassin that moves from Sweden to Italy and while he stays in Italy he falls in love with a call girl (Violante Placido) after a few dates and just when he is about to retire, he is killed at the very end by his own boss.

George Clooney, as JACK/EDWARD, is very quiet, very private, introverted, loner and he doesn't trust anyone and I mean his own shadow.

If you are in am mood for a mellow movie...this is the one for you. Otherwise, like many other reviewers, you will not get it or understand it.

4288545,2,B0049EVR32,"Normally any movie with George Clooney is a better movie simply because he is in it. True, he is easy on the eyes, but I also think he is an amazing actor.  But even George could not save this one.

First of all it is a very quiet movie.  There is way too much time with no dialogue going on.  From a plot perspective, it was very thin.  Anyone could guess how this movie was going to end and who the bad guys were in the first 15 minutes.  How many movies does Hollywood have to make about ""the one final job and I am out""?

Even the ending you see coming has more holes than a pasta strainer.  I don't want to give away anything to anyone who has the patience to sit through this, but George decides he wants to start a new life with a lady of the evening - but the film shows almost no interaction between them other than physical The character George plays is way too smart and complex to fall in love over a physical encounter.

4288546,4,B0049EVR32,"""The American"" makes you work to pick up the things that are often conveyed by the holes left behind by characters who use as few words as possible. This makes the watcher a participant,  which is rather enjoyable, given that many films today spoon feed the simplest of plots, characters, and conclusions to their audience.  The movie is occupied as much by what people don't do as what they do; as much as by what they don't say as what one expects them to say.  Pleasantries are omitted, hinting at a life lived apart from others; glances are hint at pursuit rather than attraction,  but the pursuers themselves are likewise skilled at making themselves barely visible. Clooney's character uses words as if he has to withdraw them from a safety deposit box.

  All the characters, it seems, are hiding secrets, some of them relatively harmless, some more serious,  more dubious. The characters' reticence gives the viewer time to study them, to assess them, in a way that so many other films simply make impossible, due to the busyness that crowds the screen.  One has time to reflect on what's missing from these characters,  even what might have caused it. The characters, for all the guarding of secrets that they do,  are original, because the very act of hiding a secret often makes it apparent one exists.

Clooney's character attempts to blend in by being quiet, unsociable, nearly silent. Yet these things attract notice even in a small, quiet town. The movie, notably, does not engage in Italian stereotypes,  no ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" style Mediterranean gawdy antics. So understated is the dialogue that often several avenues suggest themselves,  and that's what makes this movie so risky: the ending was never assured,  because it did not hesitate in portraying Clooney's Jack as utterly ruthless and logical, determined to survive---no matter who got in the way. The film does not sugar coat the character at all, gives him a clinical outlook,  even in the one or two scenes that a lesser actor would have used to go for the sloppy emoting that passes for good performing. One gets the sense---as the character shifts back to survival mode after relaxing for a bit-----that he is trying a new maneuver to deflect the villagers' interest in him, seeing if it works.

 The understatement of Clooney's performance hints at the tightly-wound history of a man who cannot take any mistake for granted,  any moment of relaxation, any contact with a human being.  I was sort of struck by how it would have been utterly fatal for him to have, say,  mistaken, the number for the combination that was given to him by the person sampling his craftmanship.  In ordinary life, it is simple; one makes a phone call,  admits the error. In this life,  the concession that is granted for another issue is quite nearly a threat.

  The town where this was filmed is as much a character as are the human beings that live in it,  with its narrow streets and wide steps,  severe stone walls and ancient age.  There are so many intriguing little side streets,  archways, stairways, all packed on top of one another,  that it's like a maze that leads one to more and more discoveries. One could make a whole travelogue following those streets in that small town.

  The movie does such an unsettlingly good job of making one doubt every character----an odd compliment----that during a picnic when a woman holds a pose for a few seconds too long one wonders if she's dead,  even while the setting evokes ""Dejeuner sur l'herbe""---and the tight, unsettling expression on Clooney's face lingers a beat or two too long to be comfortable----or easily assessed.

Another original moment is a car chase. Rather than turns and twists that realistically would wind up with everyone in a ditch,  in fact,  both drivers DO wind up in the ditch, so to speak. It's not thrilling. It's  nerve wracking,  because from the film's first scene, one knows that any character is expendable. It would entirely possible for the film to off its main character halfway through and still carry on with the plot.

When emotions do start to show up----but not in anything like Hollywood quantities----they seem almost gaudy, like the rose one glimpses in an espalier against a gray stone wall. This is the movie's one real weakness; the main character's sudden statement of something that seems to come rather out of the blue,  given all his understatement before.

While I can't say the movie is without flaw----though I'm hard pressed, really, to think of anything beyond that brief moment noted above----I feel that one has to be sparing with five star ratings, though perhaps I am shortchanging this understated film, which is so different from the fare one usually sees come out of Hollywood.  Serious Hollywood movies like to teach one a lesson,  or have a big message. This one does not. It is just one character and the people around him, and after a diet of Hollywood junk, this low key movie whose predominant color is gray seemed to leave the most vivid impression.",1329868800,3,5043,4.804878048780488

Similar to early Italian and French films, the expressions of the actors and what they do (visually) tells the story.

Unfortunately, Clooney has become a popular cultural icon as the man that every woman wants - this immediatly put me off him. However, after seeing him in that Cohen brothers film, and ""The Man Who Stares at Goats"", my opinion of the man changed for the better.

The story is about a professional Hitman trying to get out of the Game. He meets an old Italian priest and begins to reflect on his life and values.

But overall, the film is very slow, and the pace undermines the few thrills - as does the entirely predictable romance, gun in the handbag and wounded ""hero"".

The scenery is beautiful.  The supporting characters simple and honest, sharply contrasting with the dark secrets pulsing through the American's veins.

Artistic side of things, in terms of how the scenes are composed and the use of landscapes, lines and geometry, were quite nicely done.

4288629,4,B0049EVR32,"By some viewers, `The American,' based on the novel `A Very Private Gentleman' by British author Martin Booth, will be deemed `a work of art.' By others - a dull, overly long character piece, lacking in both plot and pace. So which is it? Well each of these views can be fully appreciated and understood after having reached the 100 minute mark. It depends almost entirely on the level of your expectations and whether or not you have the patience to be rewarded by what for me was a very engrossing and compelling piece of film. But my immediate reaction after having left the cinema 100 minutes and nine pounds sixty later? - Certainly that this is a film which cares more about taking a look at the behaviour of character rather than your conventional Hollywood tale full of stylish edits, breakneck cliffhangers, predictable dialogue and cheesy love scenes. Ultimately though, my very first thought was `what a pleasant surprise.'

- If film-goers are used to watching a lot of the Hollywood thrillers like the one's I've just described (e.g. `Quantum of Solace,' `Taken'...etc - good films in their own right) then of course `The American' will seem like the slow, boring, ""nothing really happens"" film it's been accused of being. You can't come straight from having watched Angelina Jolie's `Salt' or Liam Neeson's `The A Team' and expect to enjoy `The American,' which you'll have seen advertised as a spy thriller with George Clooney, so it's only natural to think that it will follow in a similar fashion. It doesn't. - Instead, `The American' follows more in the wake of thrillers like Mel Gibson's `Edge of Darkness' in terms of action/suspense and more like Jeff Bridges' `True Grit' in terms of character/plot development. Instead of long winded action set pieces, it has sudden but meaningful bursts of violence which work almost as effectively as in `Edge of Darkness' to contrast the slow but involving scenes of character and intrigue that worked so well in `True Grit.' So if your tastes run more toward the mainstream of Hollywood thrillers then maybe this is not the film for you.

However, what if I told you the film contains a car chase, five assassination attempts on Clooney's character, a femme fatale who isn't all she appears to be, a suspenseful foot pursuit through a narrow maze of streets with two professional hit men trying to outwit and kill one another, a steamy sex scene, a face to face showdown and a 7 person body count (more than `The Bourne Ultimatum'). Well it does. But although this may not sound boring, I can understand how the direction and execution of these set pieces could be interpreted as such. Anton Corbijn, a Dutch director known for his photography and music videos, effectively has the opposite of Paul Greengrass's flashy editing of handheld cameras used to create a sense of urgency that was used for the Bourne films, instead opting for a more reflective take on the action.

Fans of Clooney will either love or hate this film. Those who aren't fans of Clooney are likely to love it, as he gives arguably the most un-Clooney like performance of his career to date, using the same solemn intensity we saw flashes of in `Michael Clayton' and `Syriana' and turning it up to the max. Gone is the easy smile and likable charm that Clooney is known for exuding better than anyone, replaced with hard eyed stares and a strong sense of vulnerability that Clooney does well not to overdo when communicating the troubles of his flawed character to the audience.

Aided by a fresh and solid supporting cast with the likes of Thekla Reuten (In Bruges), Violante Placido and Paolo Bonacelli, Clooney has a great deal of talent to play off and Herbert Grnemeyer's contemplative music score only underlines and adds to the atmospheric, brooding quality that the film proudly possesses. Reuten brings a coldly effective steeliness to her emotionless assassin, Placido is immediately likeable as Clara, the sweet and loving prostitute and Bonacelli delivers a knowing, world weary gravitas to his philosophical role as the priest that makes you hang on to his every word and whose scenes with Clooney are the forefront for the film's moral statement and raising of questions.

So eventually, the audience end up rooting for a hit man and a prostitute, showing that not everyone is black or white. Assassination of innocent people and prostitution as occupations are controversial to say the least, so why do we end up liking these characters and wanting them to be happy? Even the squeaky clean priest is shown to have kept a dark secret, hidden away in his past. So the film's message is that everyone, no matter who they are, strives to be better and find redemption. Every single character is revealed to have sinned one way or another and a powerful line from the film is Clooney's response to the priest when being told to seek God's forgiveness, `I don't think God's very interested in me Father.' Something which could be said for all the characters and all of us in general, as highlighted by Clooney's meaningful line, `All men are sinners.'

Verdict: Not perfect but with wonderful craftsmanship from Corbijin's subtle direction to a powerful, hard hitting performance by Clooney, this is the first of its kind for the thriller genre. And hopefully not the last. If you keep an open mind and watch it with no expectations, then like me - you'll find `The American' to be a very pleasant surprise. A smart and subtle piece of drama.

4288630,2,B0049EVR32,"The first time I saw ""The American"" I missed the first 20 minutes and the rest seemed a disconnected mess. The second time I saw the whole thing and asked myself, ""Is something going on here?"" Well, yes, but not much.

Director Aaron Corbijn's effort to make a Charles Bronson-type crime drama with George Clooney in the lead goes awry almost from the beginning. Instead of successfully hawking Bronson's typical intense, aloof and cold-blooded loner, Clooney is awash in a Johnny one note straight-faced mug with more paranoia than Gene Hackman demonstrated in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Conversation/dp/B003O7I6SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Conversation</a>. Instead of a confident hit man that knows what he's doing, he's more the schizophrenic lottery winner that didn't pay the taxes and then sees the IRS around every corner.

This is a story about George Clooney as an Ameican hit man in Europe. He departs Sweden when he learns he is the next target and meanders to Italy. In one of crime drama's most enduring cliches, he agrees to one last hit that you know will be his undoing. Instead of being the hitter, he provides the weaponry. He acquires a girlfriend and has movie foreplay with the similarly gorgeous killer-to-be, a beauty with her clothes on (unlike his girlfriend in half her scenes,) and he develops a relationship with a priest. A theme grows around Clooney's inability to relate, the killing of a bunch of Italian prostitutes (that's where he meets his girlfriend), foreplay with the other killer, and Clooney's eventual route out of this life that gets played out at an Italian stream.

Throw in a duplicitous front man and you have the makings of a confusing, go nowhere crime drama that is fully realized by inadequate acting and a startling lack of direction. It's a nice travelouge small town Italy and its countryside, with a few snowy scenes in Sweden, but otherwise this is a needlessly predicatble film. I figured out the denouement about 5 minutes into this movie and I wasn't wrong (almost said I wasn't disappointed but I was.) The thematic material led me there, as did the lack of direction. It's been done to death in good and bad crime dramas over the years; if you saw Victor Mature meet his fate in 1947's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-of-Death/dp/B000B83846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss of Death</a>, you know what to expect here.

The remake had a French girl and an American criminal in Los Angeles. ""The American"" had an American and a Europen girl in Italy. One of the three had direction. After seeing Gere's remake in the theater, my friend summed it up in one sentence: ""A movie about Richard Gere trying to get a check.""

4288631,4,B0049EVR32,"George Clooney, once again, redefines the thriller genre with The American. If you are looking for a typical Hollywood thriller with chase scenes and the obligatory love triangle, this movie is not for you. The American throws all the cliches out the window. The best way I can describe this movie is to use analogies borrowed from the field of painting. If you are familiar with the portrait painter John Singer Sargent you will have an upper leg on understanding this review. The American is the equivalent to cinematic impressionism. The Sargent of filmmaking, bordering on minimalism. This movie appears, on its surface, to be very simple. And that's its intent. It's simplicity is its beauty. The story is filmed and told with incredible economy of means. Each stroke is a drawing stroke and has a purpose. The movie simplifies every detail. No shot is overdone. Each line of dialogue has a purpose. There are no overdone and cliche chase scenes. Its simplistic nature is its charm. This is a very intelligent thriller. Thematically perhaps not original but this movie's beauty is its construction. The priest tells Clooney's character that Americans believe they can escape their past. This in a nutshell is what the movie is about. Clooney attempts to escape his past and his history - for love. But he cannot do this. It's impossible to escape the sins of his past. Great movie. Film programs will love this movie. It is rare indeed to see movies like this. European in style. It's a good thing The American doesn't have the feel of an American film.",1313366400,2,1558,4.8389513108614235
4288632,2,B0049EVR32,"I just finished this movie and I can't remember about 80 of the 90 minutes of it.  And even then, the ten minutes I do recall have mostly to do with how impeccably impeccable everybody's hair is.

It's soooo serious.  The dialog soooo short.  Every camera shot is not just wide, it's soooo wide.  The girls all soooo alike.  And the movie, by result, is soooo boring.  But he's a killer and the corridors are green at night, soooo it has to be interesting, right?

George Clooney is a great deal more unbelievable in his seemingly twilight years take on Tom Cruise's assassin from Collateral.  It feels as if Clooney is approaching this role as some off broadway workshop.  He isn't ""reserved,""  no he is completely nonexistent.  Clooney made his name playing the likeable middle aged working stiff.  The ladies man at night, but busting his butt for a dime.  Don't mistake that for thinking he has ""disappeared"" in his role - he is completely forgettable, moving from one strangely out place sex scene to the next.  He must have been watching a lot of Michael Mann when he took this one - because if he isn't trying to ape Cruise, he's mirroring, to the best of his meager ability, de Niro's dance in Mann's Heat. Only in Syriana did George stretch his limits, and even then appropriately so.

But I'm being kind here.  Most of the blame for this goes to Corbijn.  If Clooney is anonymous on the call sheet, the director is MIA.

Anton Corbijn's celebrity photography have done him no favors here.  Why would they? Most of his portraiture lacked any real connection and this movie, he shows no interest, connection or insight into any character in the frame.  But hey, they spent hours getting the gel balance right on all those night corridors.  Though he directed a movie named Control - he obviously had none during the filming of this movie.  It feels as if all the calls were from Clooney from beginning to end.  Corbijn may have some photographic vision, but he has no perception on what it takes to guide a story in motion.

At least he used a Hasselblad for his still work.",1313193600,,2082,4.562162162162162

4288634,2,B0049EVR32,"This was a ten minute story streched out to 1:40.

While George Clooney is always charismatic, this was such a ""big nothing"" movie. The story was passible but the concept of a hitman questioning his profession, looking to get out and  being betrayed is an often-told tale. This plays like a European art house movie but the story and characters do not lend itself to such a mundane presentation. Much of this movie focuses on Clooney walking down cobblestone streets, up and down stairs, driving along country roads and moping around in a hotel...hardly captivating and cinematic. It seems as though there was fifteen minutes devoted to the assembly of a rifle and silencer!!!

I hated the direction and lack of narration. The movie is hardly complicated yet the manner in which the story was told didn't effectively make me care about any of the characters.

I'm a fan of Clooney because he sometimes takes bold roles however this movie couldn't have turned out the way he would have wanted. Clooney is such a good actor that I have been more harsh on this film than normal...since the expectations would be higher

I must say i was impressed by Clooney's acting. I did not expect this much acting quality of him but he has delivered. His pauses, his silences, his doubts, the few words he says here and there. All are so carefully placed and delivered.
The photography and locations are excellent and form a perfect canvas on which the story is painted. And the story is indeed a jewel, the way it is shown gives it so much power and calmness to it.

I can't agree with the negative reviewers who say that Clooney's character doesn't break a sweat under fire nor doesn't display emotion.  The scene in the restaurant with the other assasin for example, Clooney's charater clearly shows in his face that he's fighting his instinct to panic.  That panic is vividly apparent and not totally unde control.  There are unanswered questions for why he is being hunted and it's this part that doesn't make sense to me.  He's not the head of an organization nor is he on an assignment which would put him at risk---yet, people are actively after him from one side of Europe to another.  Regarding the disbeliefs:  Can someone put a rifle together from mail order parts? Certainly can.  Can a silencer be made from shop parts.  Certainly can.  Can someone pick up a downed Vespa and ride it with precision over cobblestones in a tight alley and down steps and chase down a car?..

4288670,5,B0049EVR32,"This movie is damn near perfect. The mood is one of constant and increasing paranoia. George Clooney is perfect as a man who is as cold and precise as the weapons he crafts. Some have described it as a modern western and I tend to concur. Roger Ebert likened his character to that of Alain Delon's 'Le Samourai.' I tend to agree with this assessment as well. He's a spring wound too tight for too long.

Clooney's character is reminiscent of Charles Bronson in 'The Mechanic.' (another film you should watch0 Cool, methodical and detached yet aching for connection to others. Indeed, the scene where Clooney asks his client about the distance to target, caliber is reminiscent of a scene in 'The Mechanic.'

The setting is perfect. Picture perfect actually. The narrow streets of the Italian, mountain village add to the feeling of claustrophobia. Shadows abound. Lots of corners for assailants to hide in. There isn't a wasted shot in the entire movie. Many could be used for post cards.

The casting is first rate. The Priest, who 'sees everything.' Clara, the local prostitute, Mathilda his contact and Pavel, his employer are all cast to perfection. Even the local mechanic. The cast is surprisingly small. There probably isn't but ten characters in this movie.

Anybody expecting Jason Bourne will be disappointed. Too bad. This is grown up movie for grown ups.

I got a little impatient in the beginning of the movie but soon found it quietly turning up the tension.  Truly the cinematography of the Italian countryside is nothing short of gorgeous.  At the same time you've got this hitman's paranoia vs the desire for intimacy that makes you care whether he lives or dies.  All in all, and whether you find it worth watching or not, you know you are in the presence of quality, quiet and understated.  If you can make it past the slow beginning I think you'll find it develops into something tense indeed.

A friend of mine also summed this up:  ""This is what happens when Bourne/Bond GET OLD"".

The negative reviews, no doubt, are by people looking for an action flick like a Bourne or even something as stupid as a Transformers.

If you like movies like Transformers, and your basic blow 'em up movies, this is probably NOT for you.

This is more meditative, very little dialog, and the devil is in the details.  You need to be an observant person to get the most out of this movie.  Although totally different, this movie plays more like a ""Lost in Translation"" -vs- ""Bourne/Bond/RED"" movie.",1307836800,,642,4.72972972972973

4288675,1,B0049EVR32,"""The American"" is certainly not what you would expect from the previews/trailers for the movie.  They give the impression that the movie is supposed to be action packed, thrilling and suspenseful, however, the movie falls short in all three of these categories. The movie centers around George Clooney's character, an assassin who obviously is conflicted about what he is doing and so is getting out of the business with ""one last job"".  The actual job and the slight twist accompanying it are revealed at the end of the movie and are somewhat of a letdown. However, he lowest low of the movie was the music selection, which tended to make even the most exciting scenes less so, such as in the case of the single car chase that takes place within the movie.  The tempo and feeling of the music just seemed to be off in any scene that contained the slightest bit of action/adventure, counteracting anything exciting going on on the screen.  Finally, the most redeeming quality of this movie, I think, are the scenes featuring Clooney and his love interest, a prostitute who he has started to feel for.  After the initial few sex scenes, their relationship becomes more intense and consequently more interesting as his suspicion of her motives grows.  All in all, ""The American"" is not at all the Jason Bourne-esque picture that it is advertised to be so if you are looking for a movie with some action, I would suggest skipping this film.",1307836800,7,1437,4.751004016064257
4288676,1,B0049EVR32,"oh my goodness!
How painfully boring! The 'meat' of the movie could be told in 5 maybe 10 minutes, but to add time to make a movie it seemed they chose to add one incredibly painful, long, exaggerated traveling shot after another, as well as the incredibly slow, painful shots of 'building a gun, picking out tools' etc.! UGH!

Added to all this, there were no characters one could care about. Filled with cliche's, like the prostitute who dreamed of meeting a rich man to take her away from it all.

I watched to the end to see if there might be a twist or some punch added, but it stayed a completely, painfully boring movie to the very, very end!",1307404800,10,649,4.355371900826446
4288677,5,B0049EVR32,"Truth be told, `The American' is nothing like I ever expected it to be.  The film is such a brooding and electrifying character study that works so well it shocked me.  I was expecting a more straight forward action thriller, and while the action is certainly there (the bookends are sublime), the film has far more depth than that.

Expertly paced, thoughtful and dripping with suspense.

The film takes place in Italy, where a hit-man named Jack is awaiting details on his `final' assignment.  He's done.  He wants out.  He wants to pursue a life filled with the attachments he is deprived while smothered within the restraints of his profession.  During his stay in Italy, Jack becomes acquainted with a high-class hooker named Clara.  Despite the fact that emotional ties are dangerous, Jack wants to be with her.  Instead of broaching this plot point in the clich&eacute;d and generic fashion, `The American' beautifully uses the camera to expose the inner emotional complexities within Jack.  His feelings for Clara are less `love at first sight' and more deep-seated in the emotional loss he's experienced over years of distancing himself from everyone around him.  As Jack's eventual `job' rears its head, his world starts to unravel as he discovers his professional life cannot coexist with his intimacies.

George Clooney certainly delivers his best performance in years.  I've always preferred my Clooney comedic, but this finely tuned dramatic performance is outstanding; so layered and complex.  Violante Placido is a gem of an actress.  Not only is she beyond words gorgeous (OMG), she is certainly talented enough to go step for step with Clooney and demand out attention.  She is also mysterious enough to keep the audience guessing as to what her true intentions are.

The real star of the show is director Anton Corbijn.  His film debut was 2007's `Control' (what a debut), and his sophomore effort shows that it was no fluke.  He really is extremely adept at creating natural tension with the lens and pacing his projects to exude a stylistic naturalism.  The way he uses his surroundings to produce such lasting imagery, physical and emotional, is outstanding.

In the end I can't help but recommend this film.  It sits on you, dwells in your mind's eye and definitely makes quite an impact.  It is a quieter film than one may expect, but it is within those quiet moments that the film really unveils itself to the audience.  Tackling serious subjects such as self-doubt and spirituality; `The American' is a brilliant film about a man coming to terms with his own fate.",1307404800,,2590,4.953596287703016
4288678,4,B0049EVR32,"In his latest films, George Clooney portrays men who are established in thir career, and yet not content with it.  This role is no different.  Clooney plays Jack, an assassin on the run across Europe.  As others are trying to kill him, Jack finds his way to Rome, Italy and eventually in a small town, tucked away in the mountain.  Jack keeps to himself and spends days surrounded with his daily routine of exercise, book readings about butterflies and visits to a local brothel.  He is also tasked to prepare a custom weapon for his female colleague, and he approaches such task with knowledge and dedication.

As Jack realizes that his cover is blown, he is trying to determine his next step.  We start to wonder if Jack is loosing his edge, or if he is gaining access to his long repressed humanity.  Slowly, Jack is determined to find his own path to redemption by retiring from the business and starting over.  It is the violent ending that shatters this story and reminds us that life is short, pretty as a butterfly and often times transformative even if transformation happens too late.

There are some beautiful European actresses in this film, all classical beauties.  But I truly enjoyed film's slow pace and director's relish in storytelling.  Movie is apparently made after one of the Martin Booth's books.  I love spy novels, but have never read any of Booth's books.  I think I will try him out so I can compare what is better - a book or a movie....",1306886400,,1465,4.6061776061776065
4288689,4,B0049EVR32,"Yes, it features perhaps the biggest Hollywood icon of our generation in the lead, but The American is very much a subtle, european exploration of the much fabled hitman genre.  George Clooney is Jack, an expert hitman on the run, laying as low as he can in the country hillsides of Italy.  There, his past, present, and future all collide in an exploration of how a man comes to terms with his soul, glimpsing a future he had never before thought to examine.

While many have called this film flat out boring, the truth is The American is filmed, set, and narrated much in the tradition of mid 1900's european films.  What does that mean?  Symbolism over sensational violence.  Very few characters, singular plot lines driven to help the main character find his transformative way.  Indeed, if you're looking for 10 cool guys/girls to weave a storyline in 10 different directions, this is not your film.

Simply put, this film plays out much like a novel.  Hitman novels, in fact, for years have been a subgenre of amazing acclaim yet little mainstream fanfare.  The American will remind you more of classic assassin books like 'Stiletto', Thomas Perry's 'The Butcher's Boy', or even Lawrence Block's ""Hitman"" series than recent films like 'The Machinist"" (remake)or ""Lucky number slevin""

That being said, I'm not sure i've ever seen a film carry a more novelistic feel, and it serves as an amazing canvas for an actor of Clooney's calibre to articulate a character filled with inner angst, mentally and cerebrally powerful, yet emotionally vulnerable.  A subtle yet outstanding performance that in the Taoist sense gives us ""action through nonaction""",1305331200,,1653,4.970909090909091

Anton Corbijn usually directs music videos and used to work as a photographer for the New Musical Express. He started that job because he loved the music of Joy Division which led to his first proper film in 2007, Control. It dealt with the life of lead singer Ian Curtis. This is his first feature that has nothing to do with music.

It's not what the average viewer would expect.

The American is about Jack (Clooney), who kills people for a living. In the first few minutes, we see him in action as people try to kill him in Sweden. He relocates to Italy for what he says will be his last job.

One of Jack's ""weaknesses"" is that he forms friendships instead of staying aloof while he is working on a hit.

This is not an action movie. There are two or three brief action sequences, but that's not the point of this movie. If you're looking for another Bourne movie or Taken, look elsewhere. The American is a more contemplative look at the life of a killer. We see extended sequences with no dialogue and Clooney is shown thinking. We see his paranoia and get an idea of what it would be like to be in his shoes.

Despite the warnings of his boss, Jack makes friends in Italy. Will they lead to his eventual death?

This movie will undoubtedly be too slow for the majority of viewers. I found it refreshing. It's intelligent for the most part and I was drawn in to the story. One of the things I liked about it was that Clooney didn't rely on his smirk and charm routine. He played this one seriously and it was the better for it.

The ending is deliberately ambiguous. Does Jack live or die? We can't be sure.

The cinematography is excellent. The beauty of the Italian mountains is shown frequently. The picture quality is also good, making the panoramic shots very effective.

This Blu-ray presentation is recommended for fans of the film, or people that enjoy slow-paced stories that require a bit of thought to fully appreciate.",1303689600,2,2301,4.649382716049383
4288691,3,B0049EVR32,"Bought ""The American"" on BLU RAY today on the strength of some good reviews, but mother of God is it slow - even tedious. You know you're in trouble when the 10-minute ""Making Of"" is more entertaining than the entire film itself.

So why watch it at all - let alone suffer it the whole way through? The answer of course is George Clooney. Since ""Three Kings"" and particularly ""Michael Clayton"" (see separate review), it's become obvious to movie lovers everywhere that gorgeous George is more than a pretty face - and given material he can get his teeth into, he's a top-notch actor. He's again superlative in ""The American"" - a brave (no make-up), restrained and almost colder-than-Hell performance that keeps you glued to the screen - even if it feels like forty minutes have passed without anything actually happening.

Clooney plays Jack - an assassin, a mechanic, a man who can also makes weapons that will skillfully deal out death someplace else. Jack's not afraid to pop a slug or two into a lover's back if needs be. And an event in Sweden forces him to do just that - so he must contact a man in Italy that he trusts. This man sends him out of Rome in a plain car to a small town up in the Italian hills to hold up while things get 'sorted out'. And on it goes until 'they' eventually catch up with Jack and his newfound connections in the peaceful hamlet - a growing relationship with a local woman that may even offer him redemption...

On BLU RAY the picture quality is almost surreally beautiful. Corbijn has a very stylized way of filming - lots of side profiles of faces, a man sat in a caf with the night street lit up outside like a Hopper painting - the Italian hills and buildings looking almost as arid as Spain or Portugal rather than lush - giving the feel of edginess, sparse, almost hollow - like his character. There's silence almost all of the time too adding a sense of danger to quite ordinary scenes. Close-ups are superbly lit and intimate - making Clooney's almost expressionless performance all the more chilling...

But unfortunately, most of this good stuff is washed away by some staggeringly stupid plot bits - an American in an empty town like this would stick out like a sore thumb and have local tongues wagging (especially one who looks like George Clooney). The most sexually exciting and gorgeous woman in the entire town (who would have every red-blooded Italian male pursuing her like a pack of rabid dogs) turns out to be a prostitute (great stroke of luck for George there). She is - yes you have guessed it - a tart with a heart. There are completely unnecessary sex scenes with Violante Placido that linger on her lovely truepenny bits way too long. And again down by the river - she gets her top off once more. It's gratuitous stuff than irritates rather than titillates. There's a shooting match in this tiny town one night and a very destructive car chase (with a dead body left in the wreck), but no one mentions this the next day - no Police check. The elderly town priest befriends him, but may have a past too - so he does what any Italian priest would do - he doesn't rat out the killer (give me a break). And who wants Jack dead anyway or why - no one seems to bother telling you. So as you can imagine, all of this style over substance makes it difficult to care. Even the film's name seems lazy and oddly out of place. And then it all ends with a very clichd image that leaves you feeling a little cheated...

""The American"" is not a bad film - it just promises more than it delivers. And you can't help but feel that with a cleverer script, it could have been genius.

Yet on the strength of ""Control"" and this, I feel certain that Anton Corbijn will one day deliver exactly that...",1302566400,,3743,4.441048034934497

""You are an American...you are very good with your hands"".Silent assassin,hit man,gun maker. Clooney in serious,moody mode. He has come to Italy on the orders of his employer,due to a botched assassination attempt against him by `the Swedes' in Sweden,where he holidayed with his girlfriend,whom he despatches after she finds out he uses a gun. You sense that the character Clooney plays in this,the isolated loner who trusts no one,is the black-back of the sunny mirror persona,all smiles and smooth talk of his usual on-screen persona. Clooney's roles have been getting progressively darker,Syriana,Solaris,Michael Clayton. Harking back to the thrillers of the 70s with Marvin,Newman,McQueen,Sinatra et al and with a nod to the Euro-thriller genre of Ronin. This role plays on a single note of sadness and gloom,which only the top of today's actors can summon up to carry a film. There is no deepness in these still waters. We don't get to know anything about the character or his back history nor what he is thinking. He has relationships with a prostitute who gives the film the warmth that the anti-hero lacks and a village priest,who knows he is not what he seems. Clooney cannot convey existential angst only bored anxiety. Methodically paced and precisely directed by Corbijn with beautiful cinematography,capturing the rustic wonder of the Italian village,against Jack's rootlessness,paranoia and menace rather than thrills are the order of the day.

That said, it felt true for a character who was a combination of an assassin and arms dealer and was always on the run from his enemies (yes, they make appearances in the movie) but that said this is not an action picture.  It's more of a character driven piece that does a surprisingly good job focusing (in a subtle manner) on a man who is having second thoughts about his vile life.  There's a priest and a lover to challenge his lifestyle.  I felt the priest did a better than expected job for the role.  The setting takes place mostly in a charming little town in Italy.

It opens with Clooney looking like he did in Syriana, but at least in that film you knew who he was, what he was doing, and what was happening with the plot. In The Mechanic the plot was clear and Bronson clearly cunning and ruthless, but cultured. In the Day of the Jackal the target was always looming as the objective as the assassin thrilled us with his clever strategy. In this film we don't even know WHO the target is, ever. This film opens with three killings, one especially horrific at learning it was UNnecessary just a few minutes later and it immediately becomes a listless plot and film, as does Clooney's role in it. Long rides, boring panoramas, solitude, arcane meetings and drone-like conversazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...this is why Amazon give you 48 hours to watch it - you will fall asleep a third of the way through then awaken not wanting to watch the rest of it, but you do anyway and your suspicion that it doesn't get any better is right - it doesn't. Even the sex scene is done with a terrible red filter which blurs the only great visual part of it - the sheer, truly genuine beauty of the Italian strumpet that loves him (yet he's not a client - go figure). Then, of course there is the boss and equally bland priest, neither of whom seem to have any relevance to whatever is happening. And, as if there is some saving grace by praying for a great ending, NOT! Its typical, predictable, and empty. Save your money. Clooney needs to snap out of it - he can do much, much, much better.

4288732,2,B0049EVR32,"It is a remarkable achievement to make a movie about a professional assassin boring, and that is the most successful thing about this disjointed film. The entire first half of this movie appears absolutely pointless and unnecessary, with long scenes of Clooney doing pushups, sitting around killing time or walking around aimlessly. It's really a waste of time and film. The scenes are completely disconnected and there seems to be no plot at all. George Clooney plays a hit man who makes guns for other killers as a sideline. I guess contract killing doesn't pay as well as it used to. It's a tough economy, even for criminals. Throughout the movie, people keep trying to kill him, although we never find out why. Then suddenly, in the last half hour, the movie evolves into a love story. One minute he's telling a prostitute that he's not interested in having a conversation with her, he's only there for his pleasure, and the next minute he's planning to abandon his profession for her and run away together. We never see the transition, we're just supposed to take the director's word for it that it happens. That is a major theme in Anton Corbijn's direction, unfortunately.
All of the characters in the film seem stiff, and deliver dialog like they're reading it from a teleprompter(no acting required). Also deserving a mention is the weird, creepy priest character in this film, played by Paolo Bonacelli.  He is horribly miscast in this role, which is supposed to represent Clooney's conscience. But he seems much more like a pervert who dopes his victims with a date rape drug than a holy father. Think John Wayne Gacy with a thick accent.",1301184000,,1649,4.806338028169014

Whilst George Clooney's acting is indeed, captivating, the rest of the movie drags on painfully. \nothing really happens and nothing is really being said on any level. The ethical sub-text that could be attributed would be far fetched in my oppinion.

The aim of the movie was, I think, a quiet but strong story. Unfortunatley, I think this was a seemingly endless film reel with no conclusive storyline or idea.

Not total redemption but some redemption.  And I don't know if I even believe in partial redemption for someone this dark, which is why it is not great.

In the first ten minutes he kills people trying to kill him, which is fine.  However, he also, without any hesitation, kills someone else, someone personal.  He then has to go on the lam in Italy.  He does many things in Italy and obviously he is waiting for bad things to happen all of the time.  Since he is an assassin, he expects another assassin every time a car backfires or he sees another person even owning a gun. (The Italians do not seem shy about gun ownership in this small town so that isn't hard.)

Can he in any way turn his life around or is it too late?  Can we exceed that last redemption point?  These are interesting questions and that is what the movie addresses.  It is NOT a thriller.  It is a very cerebral movie and it verges on being slow in its pacing as a result.  If you are looking for a night's entertainment after an exhausting day, this film is not it.  In fact, this reminds me more of a foreign film but with an American film star in the lead.  If you love that kind of movie, then go ahead and watch this film.

4288766,4,B0049EVR32,"Definitely one of those movies he likes to make that few people would want to watch. George said he now has the clout to make these kinds of movies and this is a perfect example. It is surely not the flash bang of a Michael Bay extravaganza or a romantic comedy or a typical spy thriller.

I would have to classify it as a thinking person's thriller. George plays a kind of assassin who makes specialized weapons for other assassins. He is extremely paranoid and with good reason. The problem with this piece is that a whole lot of nothing happens for a good bit of the movie. It is slow. Yet at the same time, there is really a lot going on. It just creeps up on you. As he hides out in the small Italian town, he does this one last job. He is warned by his handler not to make any friends, which he does anyway. That gives me the impression that the hooker he meets and falls for is a dead woman walking.

Someone is leaking his location and as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that there are only so many characters it could be. Is it the priest that befriends him? Is it the hooker he falls for? Is it the female assassin he is making the weapon for?

What I didn't like is the final scene that a glass-is-half-empty person would say is a bummer ending, while a glass-is-half-full person would say well... maybe, just maybe... As the audience, we suffer through all the slow buildup for that? I know many people would get angry at the slap in the face, while others would say ""What do you expect?"" In a way, I hate movies like this one. Still, there were things about it I liked well enough to go above three stars. I will not go as far as five because of the ending. I loved the European scenery. After living in Spain for 10 years, it all feels very familiar to me.

If you are into artsy thinking-type movies and don't mind ambiguous endings, you might like this one. Otherwise, you're probably better off going for something a little less ambiguous.",1299110400,,1963,4.297297297297297
4288767,4,B0049EVR32,"I recall reading or hearing somewhere that ""The American"" isn't quite what you expect.  I never gave that much thought until I watch the movie.  The promos for this movie depict it as an action and/or suspense film.  This is somewhat misleading and why trailers/previews at times can either praise a film or condemn them before they are released.  I can say that I really, really enjoyed this motion picture.

I am not going to rehash plot detail, because many other reviewers have done a nice job of providing a summary of this flick.  In contrast, I will betray my former statement by saying George Clooney plays a Jack, a hit man who finds pseudo sanctuary in Castel del Monte after a situation of his turns sour in Sweden.  Jack escapes Sweden and after speaking to an old contact ends up in Castel del Monte.  There is more to the movie, such as the Swedish hunting Jack, the duplicity Jack has towards his lifestyle, theology, romance, deception and redemption.

This movie isn't fast paced and is not action packed.  It is very minimal in nature and in many ways mimics an art house film.  I found this refreshing because it wasn't a CGI fest and an unintelligent piece of cinema.  There are lush shots of the landscape, images are framed almost like ""still life"" and there are periods of time where there is little dialogue.  I wasn't very surprised by these elements since this movie was directed by Anton Corbijn.

Anton Corbijn has spent most of his career taking photographs and directing music videos.  The former and the latter bless the creative process of this movie.  This would explain the artist cinematography, framing and little dialogue.  There are two scenes in particular that imitate videos that Corbijn has directed one with U2 and one with Depeche Mode.  Corbijn is the creative director for both of these bands and has been so for twenty-five plus years.

As for the acting, I felt George Clooney provided a solid performance as an ambivalent hit man questioning his ""purpose"".  Clooney provides most of his acting without and/or little dialogue, which I felt was captivating.  Violante Placido was very good as Clara, the prostitute that Jack becomes involved with.  I must note that Violante Placido is a gorgeous woman and drips with sexuality.

This movie might not be for all tastes (and that is okay), it is slow paced, at times moody and has some film noir element to it.  Notwithstanding, ""The American"" proves, if nothing else, a movie can still use the basic elements of the human psyche (theology, revenge, hope, sex and redemption) and display them in a moving and intelligent manner.",1299110400,,2624,4.7928730512249444

4288792,4,B0049EVR32,"This review originally appeared on my blog the Independent Ethos, on wordpress. This movie was also one of my favorites of last year. This is what I wrote...

With the American, Anton Corbijn follows up his debut feature Control, a movie about Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, with a thriller far removed from the music world where he first made his name. It seemed odd that an artist so attached to music (Corbijn has been involved in rock photography, album art and music video for over 30 years) would all of a sudden turn to directing no one less than George Clooney in a suspense movie, yet Corbijn hinted as much in an interview promoting Control back in 2007. ""I'd like to do another film, an action film with more tension, a thriller, if you like,"" he told contactmusic.com.

Corbijn has indeed delivered on that, but he has stayed true to the slow-paced seventies-era feel of Control, which felt like an animated version of his many photographs of Joy Division. It certainly seems ironic, having started his moving image career making music videos for that thing that revolutionized movies, MTV. It turns out Corbijn has produced a film that goes against the tropes of what many expect of a contemporary thriller. Despite the A-list Hollywood actor fronting the American this film comes from a world of the more atmospheric cinema of European cinema (Corbijn is Dutch after all) and, again, the seventies (just look at the poster art that seems to recall the feeling of films like 1974's the Parallax View). The American fills a viewer up like a fine and tenderly cooked meal, instead of the usual greasy junk from Hollywood that only tastes good in the mouth, but soon enough makes you want to throw up.

There is a mesmerizing pace to the American. Corbijn allows the camera to linger longer on the takes, impregnating the scenes with emotional and psychological depth. You get a chance to watch the actors act, whereas current Hollywood directors would take the easier way out with tightly associated cuts on focused images (see Michael Bay). Corbijn goes against this sort of lamebrain manipulation that insults the intelligence of the audience to make a rich experience, and Clooney adapts to the pace with amazing skill. As Jack, the titular American with a shady past, Clooney invites the audience in to his character's thoughts, a dark place to venture as the film lays out in a sudden burst of violence at the very start.

Clooney plays Jack, an agent with an unnamed organization, whose business is killing. He sets out for that all-too-familiar last job. His assignment takes him to a small, labyrinthine Italian village where he falls for a prostitute (Violante Placido), who returns the sentiment, and befriends a priest (Paolo Bonacelli), who himself knows about walking that difficult line of morality. Even though Jack is all too familiar with the dangers of becoming emotionally attached to innocents, try as he might, he can help but accept these souls into his life during a job that inevitably proves very risky.

As great a performance Clooney unleashes on the screen, Corbijn deserves the credit for giving this story, based on Martin Booth's novel A Very Private Gentleman, the respect it deserves as a satisfying thriller. There are five or six distinct moments of pulse-pounding action, which could never be as thrilling as they turn out to be had they not been sandwiched between deliberate moments of stillness, hence the film's dynamic, almost musical quality.

Most key are scenes where Corbijn lets the camera linger. During these moments, Corbijn composes images not unlike the photography with which he first made his name. They are images that play with light and dark and focus on a subject who carries a weighty presence. Corbijn's blog where the still image at left is taken from, features more still images he took on the set. They have been compiled in the companion photo book, Inside the American.

Appropriately, and very much like a European movie, the dialogue in the American is very sparse. Some might fault the film for this, saying it results in little character development and a confusing plot. But there is something to be said for the mystery it invites. Hollywood movies are so caught up with exposition, it can sap the mood out of a film. What Corbijn does is impregnate his images with a delicious sense of mystery that offers to stimulate the mind instead of deaden it, as most action pics oblige themselves to do.

Who knows how well this film will do ahead of the Labor Day weekend, where viewers will also have the choice to see Robert Rodriguez's Machete, a take on another kind of 70s film: the decidedly less cerebral exploitation film. I doubt the American will even surpass the Expendables, the Sylvester Stallone ensemble action flick that had dominated the box office two weeks in a row. No wonder Focus Features has decided to open the film a couple of days before the weekend. For those who want their action served with some intelligence and a deeper sense of atmosphere, there is always the American, and God bless Corbijn for coming up with that alternative.",1298678400,,5136,4.855022831050229

We rented this movie from redbox for $1.06 and even at that it was a big waste of money. All of this movie is one big filler after another. (exp. 5 minutes of him driving through a tunnel followed directly by several minute driving on a long straight open road....) We watched it for 34 minutes including the 3 very long boring adds in the beginning, she fell asleep. I was board to death and looking for something else to do. Normally even if we don't like the movie, if I spend my hard earned money on it I will still watch it all in the vain hope of it getting better. Just call me stubborn. I just couldn't do it for this movie so I turned it off. I can not stress enough that I have NEVER done that before. I have absolutely hated movies but still watched the whole thing anyway but not for this piece of trash. DO NOT BUY/RENT THIS MOVIE!!! Save your money and get something else.

EDIT: I have to add, now that I have taken a quick look at a couple of the reviews written here is that.. I am NOT a big Clooney fan. I did not have ANY expectations for this movie. I didn't pick it. I didn't see ANY adds. I didn't even know what it was about. I like a good thinker or a good action, comedy, drama,... I also watch a number of foreign subtitled films. Some reviewers seem to think that the people that don't like this movie only like action and mindless entertainment.

I LOVE to read, my entire finished basement is a library housing thousands of books and yes I have read them ALL. I love to watch a movie or read a book that ""challenges"" me. Their blanket statement that anyone that doesn't like/hate this movie must be an illiterate stupid American is just plain wrong and offensive to me. I do like a good ""mindless"" action movie just as much as everyone else but I also like a great ""thinker"" that I have to work to watch.

Perhaps the character is on a journey of self-discovery? If he is, then that point is pretty much missed.  He decides he wants out, yeah, we ALL know what that means.

He stated clearly in the movie that she was not involved in his attempted assassination and her reaction of shock and surprise over the incident and over the fact that he even carried a gun, himself, seemed to corroborate his remark. If his reason was that he couldn't afford to have his cover as an assassin blown, (which would explain why he almost brought himself to dispatch his second lover,as well),then Clooney failed heroically to deliver a character so diabolical that he could have been capable of  such actions. The question why his boss desired him dead also left no explanation. The victim of his last job also became very apparent as the movie developed, compromising the suspense. In short the film failed to deliver in all of its aspects--it was painfully slow paced, shockingly superficial in its storyline, filled with unacceptable gaps in explaining the motive of the most critical aspect of the film, and incredibly lacking in any character development. The one believable and interesting performance was provided by the priest in the movie, and the location in which it was filmed did evince some evocative beauty.

*******SPIOLER ALERT******
For those of you who take my advice but want to know why it was so terrible here's what happened:
Random Swedeish assassins are tracking Clooney. He's on the move, contacts his old ""boss"" who says he has another job, and tells him where to hide out from the swedes. Then you find out Clooney is a custom gun maker (big deal). Then the entire middle of the movie is Clooney (in silence, I don't remember any background music to help move it all along) making the gun and dating a hooker, and a few random appearances of a guy who's following him. The conclusion is that the old boss who set Clooney up with this job actually commissoned it himself and is having Clooney build the gun that's going to be used to murder Clooney. (Was that supposed to be ironic poetry?) You never find out why this boss wants to have him killed or why a gun maker is leading a dangerous spy's life. The fact that he's American, other than a few mentions from characters he meets, has absolutely nothing to do with the movie.

He could have just put a bomb in the car that Clooney gets into at the beginning of the movie and finished him off without a problem.  And the hitmen that tried to kill Clooney's character throughout the movies were hilariously bad.  Instead of shooting from behind cover they just stand out in the open and let Clooney gun them down.  Finally, the movie is ridiculously slow and boring.

Jack doesn't seem to trust the town he's sent to so he goes to another  nearby town, where he meets the Italian version of the Irish priest usually played by Barry Fitzgerald.  he  tosses the cell phone given him by the boss but calls him to check in.  the boss gives him a job of building a slienced assault weapon.  somehow another Swede shows up to finish the job  begun in that snowny Swedish  field, but naturally Jack takes off his shoes, and after  an innocent bystander is killed, he again dispatches his attacker.  now he's wondering how the Swedes found  him in the hills of Italy, calls the boss who tells hime ""He's lost his edge"".  will Jack prevail and survive  till the  movie's end.  by this time, who cares?

If you watched Michel Clayton, then you will see glimpses of that portrayal in this movie too.  It's more about what is not being said and the underlying feelings and currents that makes this movie exceptional.  You actually have to pay attention to nuances instead of being spoonfed.  I watched this movie 2 months ago, and it echoes even now.  If you are looking for an action, knock 'em sock 'em type of movie then this isn't it.  If you are looking for a heavy duty plot like Inception, then this isn't it.

4288837,1,B0049EVR32,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since I enjoy suspense and thrillers but it did not qualify as either. I can't imagine why George Clooney wanted to produce this film much less star in it or what he thought the reaction of audiences to this non-story would be. The movie didn't hang together; the viewer can't develop empathy for Jack since he shows very little warmth and no redeeming human characteristics. The protagonist has no friends (one friend he did have he killed at the beginning of the film--- evidently because she witnessed him kill someone trying to kill him. According to this movie, prostitutes that ""Jack"" encounters are all young and beautiful and he doesn't need them to fake enjoyment since he is there ""to be given pleasure, not to give it"".  He portrays an unhappy, solitary, amoral sociopath who leads a miserable existence. There is very little dialogue and what dialogue is included is very confusing to follow.  The nudity and sex scenes were gratuitous and didn't seem to achieve anything other than to get an ""R"" rating to entice people who like seeing both frontal and backside female nudity and simulated sex to pay to see this film. Clooney should really refrain from showing his body without clothes on--he is very thin and his muscles are underdeveloped--certainly not the physique you would think George Clooney would have. I kept watching the film thinking it would get better and the story would finally make sense but it didn't. The film ended and I was left thinking I had wasted a perfectly good evening watching this bomb.  ""He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword"" is the moral to the story. The irony at the end is that when he has decided to quit this solitary criminal life and run off with a prostitute and start over, he is shot in a gun battle. Although he killed the other man, he dies too. You can't identify with the character and there's no sadness at his death.  There was no reason given the audience to like or care about the character. This is a low-budget film with very few actors and it should never have been made. If I had known then what I know now, I would never have rented it. Wait for it to be shown free on television if you want to see it, don't waste your money renting or buying this DVD.  This is the second bomb Clooney has starred in recently; he needs to pick better material.",1297382400,3,2370,4.540983606557377
4288838,1,B0049EVR32,This has to be one of the worst movies ever made unless you enjoy watching Mr. Clooney walking. Dialogue is terrible at best and it is a TOTAL DISAPPOINMENT when one thinks what could have been done with the story.,1297209600,2,214,4.375
4288849,3,B0049EVR32,"Ok, first off, my 3 star rating means that I enjoyed the film and don't regret spending the time watching it. I didn't think it was fantastic, but I also didn't think it was horrible.

Further disclosure: I don't particularly like George Clooney. I have nothing against the man, I simply don't find him charismatic on the screen in most cases (for contrast, I do find Cary Grant and John Cusack, for example, to be charismatic and able to carry most films they were ever involved in).

Disclosure is out of the way, so let's get to it.

This is a film that is not heavy on dialogue. This production style hearkens back to some of the great films of yore when the directors would rely on the visual information heavily to tell their stories. It works quite well in this film. I happened to like this aspect. If you think you can't handle a film that is sparse on dialogue to tell you what you need to know, this may not be for you.

This is a film with slow pacing. I don't mean that in a bad way. Again, this style hearkens back to an earlier age when such pacing was relatively common and not riddled with explosions every 5 minutes to keep viewers interested. If you found Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai, Gone With the Wind, or even Blade Runner to be ""too slow"" and therefore ""boring"", this is probably not the film for you. That's not intended as an insult, just a bow to reality. Younger viewers especially have become accustomed to fast pacing, for better or for worse.

The story is intriguing and well-developed and the acting is par for the course (not superb (but again, I've never found Clooney to be all that believable when it comes to emotional range...although I do believe he does a pretty good job for what his role calls for here) and not bad).

Ultimately, I feel that the fact that several big questions were not resolved detracts from what otherwise would be a very fine story.

Bottom line: Good film, but could have been much better with a few loose ends tied down. Additionally, not for those with a short attention span.",1297209600,,2059,4.445623342175066
4288850,5,B0049EVR32,"I love this film. It's not for everyone, but what film is? Yes, it's slow, but it's beautiful in the way it slowly builds suspense as to what's going to happen and how Clooney's character is going to accomplish his goals. Also, it's a beautifully shot film, in beautiful locations.",1297036800,,281,4.64
4288851,2,B0049EVR32,"There were two things wrong with the movie. The first was that Clooney's character carried what I believe was a Walthe PPK (James Bond's gun), which is a small-caliber handgun. With it he shot two professional assassins with rifles who had set up to take him out -- laughably impossible. Perhaops a minor quibble, but isn't it time that movie makers get guns right? The second problem I had was with the movie's ending (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Although we ca't be sure whether or not he lives after passing out, didn't you hunger for a heroic ending where he triumphs and gets away with his beautiful girl friend? It seems that Hollywood isn't comfortable with male heroes any more -- female ones are OK -- but men simply cannot be heroic any more. I see this as part of the feminine mystique ideology that has slowly permeated contemporary life, including films and television. When men do heroic things in movies these days, the films are often cartoonish. For heroism, think of Aragorn' speech to the Men of the West at the Battle of the Gate (LOTR -- ROTK) or the Viking prayer in the last battle of The 13th Warrior.",1297036800,,1115,4.608040201005025

This movie was more pointless than a nun in a whorehouse, just absolutely senseless. I am not sure what the writers, directors, producers, or actors were thinking. You sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and nothing happens until the end when everyone dies. There were many instances in which things happened that had nothing to do with what was happening and left you clueless as to what the hell was going on. Clooney is his usual self, terrible. He can only act one way, himself, which begs the question as to why he was ever cast in that horrible batman movie.

I though new world was a awful movie, but this honestly takes the cake. The main difference between those two horrible movies, both of which could be used to extract information from terrorists, was the acting. The actors in New World seemed to actually care, and earnestly tried to salvage that horrible train wreck of a movie, whereas The American lacks everything that would make a good movie, good. Acting is sub par, the script and everything about it, are stupid and could be written better by a drunken monkey on a few hits of acid. The only nice thing about the movie is some of the scenery, which left me pondering how awesome it would be to go visit that place, which is how I spent my time while being tortured by this agonizing movie.

Stay away from this, unless maybe your kid was out all night doing something bad, sit him or her in front of this movie and I guarantee you they will talk and probably never disobey you again for fear of this inhumane punishment.",1296950400,4,1716,4.444444444444445

I expected a film with this caliber of star and director to be better written. The only good thing about this film is the cinematography, which showcases the beauty of the Italian country side and it's old tiny villages. Add to that the constant extreme close up of George Clooney's face and his naked behind (who by the way looks very old in it).

4288855,4,B0049EVR32,"""The American""(2010) is directed by Anton Corbijn (Control). The film is an adaptation of the 1980 novel ""A Very Private Gentleman"" by Martin Booth. George Clooney(Jack) portrays an assassin who is also a custom arms dealer who flees to Italy in the mountains of Abruzzo. The movie is reminiscent of Antonioni's film ""The Passenger"" (1975) in its slow pace, feeling of alienation and spiral to a place where death waits. Jack is in hiding but is also extremely exposed being the lone American in the small Italian town of Castel del Monte. The town is a labyrinth which both conceals and traps Jack. He is always looking over his shoulder as he is continues to be pursued by assassins. What unfolds very gradually is his changing outlook on life, and his future possibilities when he befriends another foreigner, Clara (Violante Placido), who's a prostitute. The film reads more like an existential film, than a typical thriller of cat and mouse, as it focuses on the life a man has chosen that leads him essentially to a dead end with little chance of escape.",1296777600,,1060,4.797814207650274

After the insteresting beginning, where Clooney and his girl are threatened by assasins, I spent the whole movie waiting for something interesting to happen til the credits were shown I got the message that this so called movie was over.

  My guess is that the director wanted to portray the lonely life of a veteran hitman and the package that comes with such a life, don't get me wrong the movie is well performed, I just don't agree that this is an interesting way of telling a story.

  A lot of people think that with no dialogue, no emotion, not a hint of an interesting plot, that the filmaker is letting the spectator come to its own conclusions, but I wouldn't care reaching conclusions from a dull and pointless storyline as this movie has, and I like the type of movie this director (is my guess) tried to make, but in my opinion he missed the mark completely.

  My other guess about the good reviews are what people like to see in this movie, what inspired them just by showing good actors with little dialogue, the fact is that this movie only gets mentioned because Clooney is the main character.

Because it is in a small village the movie moves at a slow pace like you was in a small village.  Not much dialog in the movie, which I think hurt the movie some and made it a little slow.

4288870,5,B0049EVR32,"I really liked ""the American."" I wish Hollywood made at least a few more movies like this. The American"" is about suspense and uncertainty, beautiful scenery, love scenes, and all the personal and moral collateral damage that comes from living the life of an assassin.

The typical Hollwood action hero is fast, loud, drives powerful cars, and draws lots of attention to themself. If there's any time for romance, the only real challenge is usually to clear the bad guys out of the way first so they can ride off into the sunset. If those who get killed even have a real personality and a face, Hollywood quickly provides convenient excuses for why the hero and you can feel justified to kill them. Who is a  bad guy and who you can trust and all the plotlines are neatly tied up by the end. Usually everything's a caricature - the backdrop either looks everything was all built in the last two years or else it's someone's stereotype of an urban ghetto. This is not that movie.

""The American"" is a glimpse of what anyone who actually lived the secret agent lifestyle would miss out on in life. Here the hero can't be brash and damn-the-consequences - quite the opposite - his life totally depends on being quiet and staying out of the light. Boring you say? Well, your typical action hero who talks and acts like they can do anything wouldn't last more than two or three weeks as an assassin in the world of ""The American.""

Unlike so many action/adventure movies, ""the American"" doesn't glamorize guns, technology, power, or violence. Here there are as many motor scooters and trains as there are fast sportscars. Not an indie film, but I would call it something of an anti-Hollywood film. If it doesn't neatly fit the standard categories for what you expect in a movie, I say that's a pretty good critique of the standard categories. Look through the list of movies on redbox, netflix or Blockbuster and count 'em up and tell me we really need one more mindless angry shoot-em-up movie just like all the others instead of one movie like ""the American.""

Yeah, if you watch this movie expecting an adrenaline rush of shoot-em-up scenes and vengeance you'll probably be disappointed. You will find enouh movies in this category to watch a different one every day all year long. If on the other hand you'd really like to see something a little different from the stock formula Hollywood usually serves up, enjoy this as a rare treat.",1296518400,,2434,4.664335664335664

I like to watch movies over and over. This is a one time through movie. I don't care for that. Clooney is ill at ease the entire time, and this doesn't suit him. He's at his best in a movie like Michael Clayton (where he played the law firm's fixer).

This movie was a fair way to pass some time, but it wasn't a ""wow"". Any time spent with Clooney is decent, but I prefer him in roles like ""Up in the Air"" where we see him play off his true and believable character flaws. It's not fun to see Clooney so distracted. He's a smooth one and we rely upon him to show us that cool that just rolls off of him like water. Watching Clooney in a constant distressed and nearly defeated state throughout the film is unnerving. It would make for fantastic acting only if it were believable and desirable.

The ""thrill"" of this story is watching what happens in Clooney's head. One other reviewer referred to moral crisis. It is. You can argue well it's a bit late, but forced into killing a woman he cared for could have that effect on even a stonehearted man.

You must assume that unless explicitly stated, no one would make a film about nothing -- even films about nothing do really have a point.  This film is very subtle, it is slow, but if paid enough attention to, it is definitely worth watching.

Subtly is kind of the point in this film anyway.  Most of the characters in this film are in situations that prohibit them, in one way or another, from making any real human connections.  The main character, Mr. Butterfly, is an assassin/gun dealer who seems to have found love in the beginning of the movie, only to have had to shoot his lover in the head shortly after a beautiful and intimate time with her.  Another character is a priest, who fathers an illegitimate child, but is prohibited from openly having a connection to it.  Yet another character, Clara, is a prostitute, and the inability to have real connections to other humans doesn't really need explaining.  One of the most mysterious characters is the main character's counterpart, another assassin who works out the purchase of a weapon from Mr. Butterfly.  Each character in the film consistently mistakes what we would normally consider gestures of attraction/consideration as real.  There are some truly beautiful moments in the movie when you see the character hopeful that something human is happening to them, then the return to themselves as if it had never happened when they realize they were wrong.  In real life, we would attempt to cover our own transition between The Hopeful and The Realist as subtly as possible.  In the film, these moments are fleeting and they are very subtle, and there is a reason why there is so little music in the film:  you'd never notice these moments if you were blinded by music and action.

This film is not an action movie, and in my opinion, it is not a thriller.  It is about human interaction and the quiet desperation in which we all too often find ourselves.  We've all been there, and we all know what it's like to hope someone likes us and to have our defenses ready when we find out otherwise.  We all have created our own prison, made from fear of rejection or otherwise, and have had to live with the unintended consequences of those prisons.  This film attempts to show these prisons through the characters' chosen profession -- that's why there is an assassin, a priest and a prostitue.  It's kind of brilliant.

In my opinion, art is about causing us to reflect so that we may become better versions of ourselves, and this film certainly does that.  It bravely states ""Look at who we are.  What are we doing to ourselves?""  Bravo.",1295913600,3,2789,4.635437881873727

Yes, with its setting in Sweden and the Italian countryside, The American has plenty of stunning images.  Yes, there are plenty of good cloak-and-dagger scenes.  And, yes, there's a voluptuous hooker who takes off her clothes a lot.

But this movie is missing one key factor: a plot.

We never find out who Clooney's character is, what his ""job"" is or was, who he works for, why he mopes around the entire movie, or why mysterious people are trying to kill him.

I kept waiting for some explanation, some story line that would make the whole thing make sense.  But it never came, which is too bad, really.  This could have been a very good movie if the director had decided to let the audience in on the story.

4288956,3,B0049EVR32,"With all the advanced advertizing for this movie, my wife and I rented The American  and anticipated a fun evening watching an entertaining thriller.  That was not what occurred.

The American is not a ""thriller"", but a slow moving crime story.  This film is similar to the ""Spaghetti Westerns"" made popular by Clint Eastwood in the 1960s, in that it has a slow moving plot, little dialogue, and highly symbolic scenes and gestures.  It is a character story with a moral.

George Clooney stars as Jack, an assassin who is growing tired of his profession.  After being ambushed near a lake in Sweden, Jack flees to a remote village in Italy.  He functions with a false name, and takes what he hopes to be his last job, making an assault rifle for a colleague.

Jack encounters two characters who attempt to reform him: a priest and a prostitute.  The priest, Father Benedetto, played by Paolo Bonacelli, senses that he is a criminal (a sinner who still intends to sin) but listens to him and accepts and befriends him.
The prostitute, Clara, played by Violante Placido, provides him with comfort and  understanding.  Clara offers Jack unconditional love and Jack slowly falls for her.

The American is a film for a few.  The typical viewer may leave during the middle of the movie or wonder why they stayed.  Those who love character studies will likely enjoy the film.  I rate this film average.",1295222400,17,1395,4.726141078838174

4288958,3,B0049EVR32,"I knew it wasn't an action thriller going in, but the slow pace still put me off a little. The plot was a little open-ended. The plot was the typical bad guy(gangster/spy/hitman), something happens to him, he becomes human, he wants to stop after one last job, sometimes he finds love, and sometimes he even survives.  Movies with a similar plot would be Carlito's Way, Grosse Pointe Blank, the Angel and the Bad Man, etc. This movie is a little more subtle than the others, but not much.

Clooney was very good, but I think he might have been miscaste a tad, although he looked very lean and mean in the movie. The priest was good. He had a great face and personality. The Italian girlfriend/hooker was ok, but it wasn't much of a part. I'm not sure why Clooney fell for her. The scenery was good. The endless roads and streets were interesting, but boring after a while. Even though I never found out what exactly is going on in the movie, predicting what was happening next was not difficult, so it seemed long for its running time. The movie used twisting country roads or narrow confusing streets as a metaphor for the plot, but it is not that complicated.

4288994,4,B0049EVR32,"Probably a lot of people will be disappointed with the pace of this movie, as so many moviegoers have grown accustomed to fast-paced thrillers with loud and eye-catching visual and sound effects.  There are none of these in this tense drama/thriller headlined by George Clooney.  Clooney plays a hitman and master builder of customized weaponry on whom the tables are turned. The underlying personal drama involves Clooney's conflict between living the necessarily isolated and non-commital life of someone in his business with the profound need to be intimate with another human being.  This theme runs through the movie, not only in terms of Clooney's relationships with females, but with other people as well.

The movie is paced very slowly and there are usually no more than two people on camera and they tend to be isolated in their scenes by the locales selected for filming: a lonely stream off the side of a road, an enclosed veranda high above a small town, a dark and sparsely furnished room.  These scenes create a constant sense of dislocation and unconnectedness to the larger world, so that if anything happened to the actors in the scene, little or nothing would ever be known of them.  The director used this cleverly to accentuate the sense of isolation felt by Clooney.

Unless I missed it, the plot leaves the question of why Clooney became the prey unanswered, although this turn of events is consistent with the message that Clooney's profession is one of sudden, irrevesible and often regretable twists.

This is one of those movies that leaves you more with material to ruminate over than with memorable scenes.  That is as it was intended to be and it works on that level.  If you are looking for a shoot 'em up, wild car chase movie of the current genre of excess, this is not it.

It's not an American action movie. It definitely has a European sensibility. It is a contemplative thriller and character study, not a hyper-violent action movie. The tension percolates, not explodes. We see Clooney's character slowly evolve, trying to remove the armor that has closed him off for so long.

The cinematography is often stunning. Corbijn shows his photographic background in the way he frames shots. There is real tension as the movie moves towards its climax. But it's a quiet, coiled tension, not the cartoonish action we see in too many American films.

The movie has its flaws. The plot is familiar. It is never fully explained why Jack is a target of those after him. But none of this detracts from the movie's strengths, which are considerable to those have the patience to appreciate the art in this film.

Antonioni's ""The Passenger"" has been mentioned as a comparison. The comparison is not fully apt, other than the similar ending. It is not Anotnioni's best film and its cinematography is sub-par compared to ""The American.""

4289041,3,B0049EVR32,"The American features George Clooney and an excellent unknown European cast, but the screenplay has been stripped of backstory, context, and most of the things that a viewer needs to care about a film.  I'm guessing the filmmaker despises films that are full of out of context exposition (the kind of dialogue that is ridiculed in the animated ""The Incredibles""  - where villains monologue rather than doing away with their foe, giving the hero time to counter-attack and get away from the villain.)  ""The American"" moves along without exposition.  I don't mind if a movie requires me to use my own intelligence and imagination to ""fill in the missing parts"", but this film doesn't add enough to make it clear that it is worth my time to do so.

Clooney plays Jack... or perhaps Edward.  We're shown that he is a skilled killer, and that ""the Swedes"" are on his trail.  Jack answers to Pavel, played by Johan Leysen, but we're not told or shown why, or Pavel's place in the universe.  Are they mercenaries?  Spies affiliated with governments?  Corporate or mafia hitmen?  We don't know.  We only know ""Jack"" is a bad dude, and Pavel is his boss.

Jack goes from undercover in Sweden to Italy, where he hides out in Abruzzo, one of those scenic medieval towns built into the side of a mountain.  He is befriended by Paolo Bonacelli as Father Benedetto, a priest who knows when a man has something to hide.  The Father has secrets of his own.

Relationships  are deadly disasters for Jack, and Pavel warns him not to make any friends in his new hideout.  ""I thought you had learned that by now,"" Pavel admonishes Jack after a lady friend dies in Jack's wake in an early scene.

Jack tries to comply, making human contact only with the Priest and Prostitutes.  He tells a hooker ""you don't have to act for me - I'm here for my pleasure, not yours.""

Pavel sends an emissary with a new job for Jack - to build an assassin's weapon with a silencer, the range of a rifle and the speed of a machine gun.  These scenes were superficially interesting, but without context narrative tension is not generated.  Jack doesn't care what the gun will be used for - only that he has the assignment.  Since he didn't seem to care - I didn't either.

It is worth mentioning that Violante Placido is good as Clara, a prostitute who doesn't know about Jack's life.  Clara seems to become genuinely interested in Jack, but since assassins are sent one after another to kill Jack, you share Jack's paranoia that Clara may only be an employee of Jack's nameless enemies.

The actual narrative tension is generated because Jack, with a job that absolutely cannot allow human relationships, is only human.  In his world everyone is suspect - someone who could possibly have been sent to kill him.  Can Jack find love?  With the rest of the movie so coldly methodical it is worth asking: do we care?",1294012800,2,2873,4.5984251968503935

4289043,3,B0049EVR32,"George Clooney is one stressed-out assassin. He winces a lot, rubs his eyes, wears a pained expression. He drives alone at night, moody. He walks through dark and deserted streets, moody. There's a lot of moodiness in the air.
Slow-paced films like *The American* disdain sensationalism. They're slow because they want to engage viewers psychologically. You're not supposed to doze off, you're supposed to be thinking about the moral significance of the hit man's actions: Will he defy his handler, protect the girl, get out of this dehumanizing racket?
In one scene, Clooney has grown suspicious of the gold-hearted hooker he has befriended (the stunning Violante Placido). Must be all the stress. So he takes another drive, enters yet another phone booth, calls his spymaster and argues with him, broods in yet another cafe over yet another cup of espresso.
Padding events like this has a purpose if the events raise questions that require time for rumination. But the dilemmas raised by *The American* aren't complex.
Should he get out? Yes. Should he build meaningful relationships and stop being so aloof all the time? Yes. Are the bad guys bad? Well, they're not very good: Director Anton Corbijn fumbles the film's only two action sequences with eye-rolling implausibility.
To be fair, Corbijn often succeeds in creating tension. There's a startling opening sequence in snow-blanketed Sweden. When Clooney drops off the high-powered rifle he has fashioned, you can feel the danger he's in. And in a minimal-dialogue movie that needs a good soundtrack to prop up sagging interest, Herbert Gronemeyer delivers a gloomy, minimalist score full of groaning cellos and blips of electronica.
*The American* also has its location going for it: the hillside town of Castel del Monte (only 400 real-life residents, preserved in a national park, looking much as it did during the Renaissance). Those winding stone stairways make for great chase scenes. They're like a labyrinth. That's it! Clooney's caught in a maze, he doesn't know how to get out, the layout of the town is a metaphor for his quandary. Let's be sure to emphasize that. Let's emphasize that many, many times.",1294012800,4,2172,5.121126760563381

But this was still an incredible movie experience. And the reason is: It's more true to life than so many of the ubiquitous blood-n-guts-flying-everywhere-and-on-everyone movies that dominates the genre today.

This was ""real"" in the sense that this is the life of a genuine assassin. It's not glorious, not James Bond, not Tarantino, not living on free & easy street - it's bleeping business, pure and plainly simple.

The morbid dryness, the lonely paranoid existence with little beyond fiscal compensation to comfort you - that's the point. Choosing the business of killing means that you're not going to get a normal life - not by a long shot. No pun intended.

4289049,4,B0049EVR32,"Easily the biggest surprise hit of the year, THE AMERICAN isn't quite an espionage thriller (it moves far too slowly), nor is it a romance (though there is plenty of that).  It's really one man's quest for identity, set against his job as an American spy in Italy, and involving his entanglement with some local beauties (who may or may not be who they seem).

THE AMERICAN is a mostly-foreign film that certain does not fit the expectations of many of the people who saw it (check out all the negative reviews here for proof of that).  It's a slow-burner, heightened by George Clooney's melancholy performance; he's basically channeling UP IN THE AIR's Ryan Bingham through a watered-down Seth Gecko (FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN).  We've seen him better, but he's perfect for this role.  The ladies who surround him--names woefully unfamiliar to most of us--easily hold their own.  The entire cast provides that extra touch of reality that anchors the film and gives it that extra bit of emotional resonance.

Anton Corbijin's directing is equally top-notch.  The problem lies in the script (I won't comment on Martin Booth's novel, as I have not read it; typically, the book is better than the film, but you know this), which moves too slowly for its own good.  Not that this is a fast-paced story, or should be; but there can be tension in emotional tales, suspense in the mundane--we don't need bullets flying around to put us on the edge of our seats.  Rowan Joffe's script doesn't give us that.  If the script had been up to par with the cast, directing, and cinematography, the film would have been a close contender for status of ""modern classic.""

Firstly, I misunderstood the film advertisement and initially mistook this film to be an action/adventure thriller.  So there was an initial disappointment, but I got over it and for the most part was moderately entertained by the tragic romance & drama involving the burnt out hitman/arms customizer (George Clooney) who longs for comfort through friendship & romance which is forbidden in his line of work.

What nearly ruined this film for me was the unnecessarily elaborate climatic scene where the the female assassin who is contracted to kill Clooney's character is mortally wounded by her employer (Clooney's handler) when the handler decides he's going to kill Clooney's character himself.  Why?  Why hire an assassin in the first place, if you are going to try to do the job yourself? It seems to me, that practicality would dictate allowing the assassin to do her job. The ending is inexplicable and overly elaborate just so the film can portray the handler's treachery and to have a poignant and sad ending where ""the American"" can meet his lover one last time before he dies at their secret meeting place.

It could have been a better movie, if the storyline provided a more logical execution of the ending, but as is, I have to give it a ""3"".",1293840000,5,1352,4.781115879828326

The director took full advantage of the quaint European towns, villages, and countryside to give the movie a strong sense of place, and he or she succeeded very nicely. This gave the movie an old Europe mystique that made it much more interesting and engaging than it would have otherwise been due to the relatively thin plot.

Nevertheless, the plot is good enough and proceeds without a hitch, but it is not a high-octane movie. It is the antithesis of the Mission Impossible and Bourne movies.

4289139,5,B0049EVR32,"THE AMERICAN is decidedly not an American made movie.  The subtlety and intelligence of foreign films is everywhere evident - the minimal dialogue, the use of poignant silences, the lighting of tense moments, and the acting. Dutch director Anton Corbijn has achieved just the right amount of subdued tension that propels this story based on Martin Booth's novel  'A Very Private Gentleman' and adapted for the screen by Rowan Joffee. The result is an understated elegy about fear and questions of trust.

The film opens in snowbound Sweden where assassin Jack (George Clooney, pared down physically and giving a performance of extraordinary subtlety), thinking that he is hiding, is discovered and must flee.  He receives instructions from his 'boss' Pavel (Johan Leysen) to go to a small town in Italy to await further assignments and to make no friends.  In the little Italian town Jack receives his next assignment - to build a very small but deadly weapon for a Belgian assassin Mathilde (Thekla Reuten).  Jack agrees to this 'last assignment', gathers the materials for the weapon, meeting the town priest  Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli) who is able to read Jack like few others  ('You cannot deny the existence of hell. You live in it. It is a place without love.') and assists Jack in finding parts for the weapon from one Fabio (Filippo Timi) who has a close physical resemblance to the old priest. Jack also encounters a prostitute Clara (Violante Placido) and finds his business arrangement with her evolving into something more meaningful.  Jack's life is further disrupted when a Swedish assassin finds Jack's hiding place and Jack must destroy or be destroyed.  He finally completes the weapon for Mathilde, the weapon is accepted, and Jack decides to make good on his decision to have this as his last assignment.  But fate has a different idea and the ending of the film is intensely dramatic.

This is a very quiet movie; the musical score by Herbert Gr&ouml;nemeyer is most often a single finger piano score, the cinematography by Martin Ruhe captures the beauty of both snowy Sweden and isolated Italy while keeping a close focus on the sensitive face of Clooney.  Though this film will not please those who love  loud, conflagration CGI effects, for those who enjoy the beauty of understatement and sensitive character studies this film is first class. The film is as much about what is not said or shown as it is with the quiet action it provides.  It is a pleasure to see George Clooney expand his acting horizons this way.

4289140,4,B0049EVR32,"George Clooney plays an assassin/gunsmith who has ""lost his edge,"" thereby making himself a target in this taut thriller.  The director worked as a photographer for 35 years, therefore this film has beautiful vistas in Sweden and in a seldom-seen, arid region of Italy.

Clooney's quiet, grim performance would be familiar to viewers who have seen him in films like ""Michael Clayton.""  There's the rub; though the performances are subdued and pitch-perfect, the photography breathtaking, the plot turns are simply too predictable.  We have been here before; as the director admits, this story is the old ""gunfighter seeks redemption"" bit.  For example, the protagonist finds solace in the arms of a prostitute with a heart of gold.  How many times have we seen this?  It almost seems like the Eagles song ""Desperado"" is about to take over any moment.

Though derivative, the film features dialogue which is crisp and understated.  At every point, there are signs of craftsmanship which redeem the tired plotline.

The pacing of this film is leisurely by modern standards; there are no ""Terminator 2"" style chases - thank Goodness - which has rankled many of the viewers whose reviews are shown here.

I'm sure this is due to people just wanting more of the same garbage that is already out there and being disappointed by something they almost certainly found to be boring and empty. However this film is incredibly sophisticated, subtle, methodical, and intense. This is not a fast paced action film. This is a meticulously crafted work of art by one incredibly talented filmmaker. A character study where the viewer must be on his toes to pick up the paranoia that the protagonist is experiencing. It's gorgeously shot, handsomely acted by Clooney, and an absolute delight to watch. This is for people who love sophisticated yet subtle cinema. I can also see this films roots in the 70s and can only hope this is the start of a building trend.

4289143,4,B0049EVR32,"This is NOT an action film, or even remotely Hollywood in any way; it's a quiet character study. So don't watch it if, like many of the reviewers here, you need Action! Thrills! Excitement! Combining the slow, peaceful feel of '60s and '70s European cinema with Leone's Man With No Name series, The American works due to Clooney's finely measured performance and director Anton Corbijn's gorgeous sense of composition and light.

I picked up this blu-ray (a sweet transfer with a fair but short doc and a few deleted scenes as extras) when I saw Corbijn's name, as I've loved his photography since seeing his first album covers in the late '70s, and his classic Art Of Noise Beat Box video in 1983. His work for U2 around The Joshua Tree era was iconic, and he's done so much gorgeous art I figured this would at least look good. And that it does, very much so. The splendid Italian Abruzzo hill country makes this film come alive, and the many fine supporting actors bring a solid sense of realism to the proceedings. Which is why a few blown details were rather irking..

[Spoilers...] I just can't buy that after a bunch of shots, a crashed car with a dead man inside and shot-out windows and tires, along with an innocent local shot to death up the street, nobody is around to look, nor that the police don't have the town swarmed the next day. And why does the gun blow up at the end? Did George do it on purpose? And falling in love with the hooker didn't really gel either. But oh well, I guess you just have to take what you get.

And most of what we get here is very good indeed. As long as you're not waiting on a murder a minute like most modern thrillers, you'll get many fine moments here, including a nice opening shock. Ultimately, this is very much a European film, not even vaguely Hollyweird, and that's a lot of what's so good about it. The American is for film fans who appreciate quiet beauty as much or more than thrills and spills.",1293494400,4,1954,4.407202216066482

No, it is not fast-paced, yes, the camera does pan lovingly over the landscape (and takes some really outstanding aerial shots), yes, George says very little and there seems to be no traffic (of any kind) in this part of Italy. However, as a somber character study of a death dealer approaching death it is just excellent. I found the atmosphere, the pacing, the minimal dialogue (much of it in Italian) and the minutiae of 'Jack's' craft thoroughly absorbing. I see it as a counterpoint to the ridiculousness of the other films in the action/thriller genre - not that they aren't enjoyable on their own level. Whereas in other films a Matt Damon or a Pierce Brosnan would jump on a high powered motorcycle for the chase scene, Clooney uses a thoroughly Italian scooter. The weapons employed are small, subtle, appropriate. This film to me recalled Day of the Jackal (1973) in its ability to evoke the stealthy, paranoid world of the international assassin. Kudos to George for taking on such a quiet role and for bringing to it a depth of feeling (just watch his eyes) that really evokes the chilly world of unredeemed loneliness and isolation his chosen career necessitates.

Although there is a very slow-pacing through much of the film when we just watch as things quietly unfold, often with little or no dialogue or action, this is a strength rather than a weakness. Some people have said they find the film boring and too slow. It is not Bond or Bourne but a rich character study that takes it's own time unfolding. The location filming in Sweden and Italy provide plenty of visually stunning scenery. Violante Placido is also gorgeous and she provides plenty of sizzle with several nude scenes. I may learn Italian and go back to Italy again!! One of the most unsettling aspects of this film is that you are never too sure of people or their motives.

You watch Clooney slowely assemble and design parts for an improvised firearm(Again, You just watch all the tedious long boreing actions of him makeing each individual piece). You watch Clooney make love to a prostitute(Which Ironically, You only see ~13 seconds of). You watch him do many more tedious things as he pitters around.

4289177,5,B0049EVR32,"The American' is a quietly powerful story and badly marketed by Focus Features. This is a slow burn character study that is ultimately very close to a remake of Jean-Pierre Melville's film 'Le Samourai'.

Director Anton Corbijn and scribe Rowan Joffe have taken Martin Booth's novel and crafted a real masterpiece here.  George Clooney gives a top 5 performance as an assassin with a moral crisis of sorts, and those who stick with this film are rewarded.

BUT: It's definitely not for everyone. Those who are game for it are likely to become big fans.  The film likely won't do much damage in the Oscar race, but that doesn't mean it isn't deserving of attention, because it definitely is. Jack (Clooney) is an assassin hiding out in a small Italian village.  While there, he's supposed to keep a low profile and just wait for his next assignment.  According to his boss (Johan Leysen) it's supposed to be simple, he'll just be making a custom rifle for another assassin (Thekla Reuten), not evening firing it.  His lack of connection to the world gets to him however, and he soon finds himself seeing a local prostitute (Violante Placido) and befriending the town's priest (Paolo Bonacelli).  Occasionally, someone will try to kill Jack, but that's almost beside the point in this film.  The focus is far more on the potential romance with the prostitute and the possibly redemption of Jack's soul.

George Clooney is excellent here, taking risks again as an actor and stripped of all of his charm.  He's rarely been better than he is here.  The film lives and dies by his performance, and he's more than up to the challenge.  The movie would suffer if a lesser actor was in the role.  He's supported by an almost exclusively foreign cast, and they accent Clooney well, while not stealing the spotlight.  Leysen is mostly seen talking to Clooney on the phone, but he's suitably menacing.  Reuten comes off as both sexy and deadly, which is essentially for her scenes with Clooney.  As for his two non-violent companions, his chemistry with Placido is very strong (and sexual...she's not afraid of nudity in the least), while it's more of a father-son thing with Bonacelli.  No one here is bad, but it's the Clooney show through and through in this flick. Corbijn is a visual stylist while not being flashy, in the vein of the directors of the 1970's.  Here he lingers on shots of Italy, making the village almost a character unto itself.  Some might fault his extraordinarily slow pacing, but I found it more deliberate than ""slow"", per say.  The script by Joffe is good, but wouldn't be what it is without Corbijn directing it and Clooney acting in it.  Of the three major players, Corbijn is most deserving of awards attention, but ironically is the least likely to receive it. On the Oscar front, the film is good enough to be mentioned in the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography fronts, but if any will happen, it'll be Cinematography of Martin Ruhe getting recognized.  The flick is just too ""indie"" for a mainstream release (creating a lot of disgruntled viewers, like the one below) AND rated R for nudity, so it'll divide audiences and voters rather than uniting them.  That's not a recipe for success, but it takes nothing away from the quality of the movie. 'The American' is one of the better releases of 2010.  It won't satisfy those looking for a shoot-em-up, clean cut storytelling, or a neat denouement, but if you're in the mood for something different, this is a real treat.",1289952000,48,3547,4.775409836065574

Short Attention Span Summary:

1. We are introduced to George Clooney in a cabin with his woman. When they are getting ready to leave and go out into the winter snow, he sees some sharpshooters (apparently there to send him to meet his maker) and shoots them dead. He also shoots his woman in the head.
2. Later, he has to go to Italy to hide out.
3. He makes friends with a priest there. (I guess this was taking him in the direction of Redemption.)
4. Clooney's character also seems to have a real taste for hookers. So, over one of his many visits to pay-for-play houses he finds one hooker that he particularly likes and gives her Oral Pleasure. (Sure, I bet *that's* never happened to her before. I sure can see why that would be enough to make a girl fall in love and leave the hooking business after a single visit.)
5. The agent/ broker who has been sending him places also seems to have hired a woman to kill Clooney's character after he delivered a gun to her that he thought that he was making for someone else but that she actually was going to use to kill him. (It comes out that she is working for Clooney's Agent-Broker).
6. Clooney meets the Hooker Girlfriend at some place, and his Gun Customer finds him and puts his head into the crosshairs. After his Would-be asssassin stands there looking at him and his girlfriend for about 45 minutes. At minute #46, god-only-knows who shoots her in the head and Clooney goes up to her vantage point and finds that she is still breathing (with half of her head missing) long enough to tell him that his Agent-Broker is the one who hired him (as if he couldn't figure that out when people came all the way to this obscure Italian village to kill him).
7. As he is fleeing the scene (where no police come in spite of enough gunfire to attract at least some attention), Clooney walks away. Behind him is the Agent-Broker who raises the gun to shoot him, but Clooney (somehow) knows that he is there and turns around and shoots him dead. Then Clooney gets into the car and drives away (again, no police).
8. As he is driving toward the location at which he told the Hooker Girlfriend to meet him, we find out that he has been hit. (Seems that he didn't know until after driving away for a few miles). He sees the hooker while driving and dies behind the steering whille.

This is one of the silliest movies that I've ever seen.  Plot details that are left unanswered. (Who did Clooney work for? Why was his Agent-Broker a double dealer? Why did he shoot his first woman in the head? How were there never any police anywhere at any time useful? Things that just come out nowhere.) Rauchy sex scenes that didn't do much for the plot (this *was* supposed to be a thriller, after all).

I can only guess that Clooney wanted to see how much his acting could save/carry a desperate/ lashed-together plot. (There has to be at least one rational reason that he would put his name on this rubbish.)

Thank God for pirated DVDs, because I would have needed to be put in restraints if I'd paid the price of a movie ticket to see this film.",1289433600,14,3148,4.372649572649572
4289181,4,B0049EVR32,"My kind of movie, nearly. Starts in snowy Sweden, then moves to Italy and stays there. Lovely visuals, nice slowly paced taciturnity. Nice soundtrack too (done by Herbert Groenemeyer, a normally rather horrible German pop star; but don't worry, he doesn't sing here, just plays the piano, thanks Herbert!).
Great job by Clooney, the central character. The story is rather small, which suits the whole concept. Most of the time we watch Clooney practicing the craft of his character, or trying not to make friends, according to instructions and rules of reason. Or we watch him being bewildered, which he does very well.

Despite the title, this is not after a Henry James novel. (I will review that one soon anyway.) The subject is only marginally Jamesian: an American expatriate in Italy, with some social problems and a special predicament. James was more interested in painters and sculptors and businessmen. Clooney here tries to pretend to be a photographer, but the local priest looks through him easily: you are a craftsman! The craft is assassination, which is a craft that James rather preferred to ignore, if I remember correctly.

Now, in a masterwork of minimalism, he takes George Clooney through the rustic Italian countryside, where he is laying low after an attempt on his life in Sweden. Clooney is Jack (or Edward, or neither), a gun runner- and probable assassin- who gradually realizes he wants something more from his life of shadows and mistrust after coming in contact with a well-meaning preacher and sympathetic prostitute (with whom he falls in love). Jack's cold mental and physical isolation is reflected through the small populace of the village he frequents as well as the serenity of nearby woods...and Clooney is compelling as an amoral (at best) mercenary grappling with the growth of his heart, if not his conscience. Corbijn has managed to update and transplant Jean-Pierre Melville's existential Le Samourai from France to Italy, and it clicks.",1288828800,2,1019,5.181818181818182

4289185,3,B0049EVR32,"I was expecting a thriller - but Anton Corbijn serves up a post modern Euro style 70s like film - which reminded me of Soderbergh's Solaris - a decidedly non commercial vehicle.  Despite his box office veneer, George Clooney has eclectic tastes as an actor and filmmaker, and The American is no exception.

If you're expecting a Steve McQueen kind of show - forget it.  If you're expecting The Bourne Identity - which I was - this is not the case.  If you're expecting Nicholas Roeg meets Ernest Hemingway with a rifle - I think you'll have The American.  This is not a plot driven film, but a character study of an arms maker.  Strangely, it felt like George Clooney's character from ""Up in the Air"" had moved sideways to inhabit this movie.  Meaning that Clooney is basically getting into that existentialist mode again.  His character is confronted with the meaning of life.

The minimalist soundtrack keeps you in the moment of this Italian setting.  Lots of rolling hills, clouds, and many angles of George Clooney's car scurrying up and down the winding road.  I could imagine the filmmaker there with his tripod.

Although not excruciatingly slow, I would hesitate to call this a thriller, but it embraces from what I've seen the feel of the book.  The plot is not airtight, but wikipedia fortunately is available to help the viewer tie up loose ends!  Violante Placido is a sight for sore eyes and the Italian girlfriend you never had.  For the ladies, Clooney shows that he's still a taut looking sex symbol.  Actually, my friends and I thought he might have been slightly too good looking for the part.  I could think of various other character actors that would have sucked me in.  James Woods anyone?  Robert Redford?

I would've amped up the plot a little more, but that was never the intention.  So be warned!  Those seeking George Clooney in thriller mode will be better off watching Michael Clayton (again).  I will always remember Anton Corbijn for shooting U2's album covers (Joshua Tree) (PS - I mixed him up with Phil Joanou - the man who directed U2 in their concert doc ""Rattle & Hum"" - thanks to Spammypig for correcting me) - and it's good to see he's still around.",1287705600,18,2189,4.657963446475196

If your attention span is short, then watch SALT.  If you enjoy a thought-provoking tale of intrigue that keeps you guessing all the way to the very, and I do mean very, end, then THE AMERICAN is for you.  There are time-consuming sequences in the film that communicate the tedium of laying low to avoid discovery.  Unfortunately, this realism seems to have turned off some cinema-goers who expected a kinetic 007-type assault on the senses.  In THE AMERICAN, we have a drama of a paranoid lone wolf hitman who is a prisoner of his own profession, where all Europe is a place of fear and suspicion.  The movie is peppered here and there with both violence and romance.  When the action does come, it's brutal and decisive.  When sex does happen, it's raw and impactful.

So settle down with a meal or ample supply of snacks and watch this really cool movie.  You'll have a ball trying to figure out who wishes Clooney's character well, and who is out to kill him.

4289208,1,B0049EVR32,"I agree with the reviewer who left The American 30 minutes to go watch their lawn grow. That is what I should have done. Watching the grass grow would have been more exciting. The scenery was great, but it also upset me because I could have gotten a two-hour nap in the theater if not for the overly vivid scenery shining into my eyes. I wanted to give this zero stars or a half-star, but I wasn't able to. So, please know that I am being overly, overly generous with my one star review. The shame of it is that it will probably be up for some Academy Awards because it was ""artsy"" ""intriguing"" or a study in ""character development."" Tough to see how the characters develop with so little dialogue and having to read the dailogue since Clooney was the only one who spoke any English. If not for the bright, vivid scenery, there are times when you feel you're watching a silent film from the 1920's. Boooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrring. I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life and my $10 back. Please don't buy this movie. Save your money for something good and thank me later when you do something else in those two hours that you would have spent watching this boring piece of garbage.",1285545600,10,1178,4.383561643835616

STARRING: George Clooney, Paolo Bonacelli  Violante Placido and Irina Bjrklund

WRITTEN BY: Rowan Joffe; based on the novel by Martin Booth

DIRECTED BY: Anton Corbijn

Rated: R
Genre: Drama / Thriller
Release Date: 01 September 2010
Review Date: 07 September 2010

The first thing you need to know about The American, is that it's probably not going to be what you expect. The daunting music and fast editing we see in the trailer is nothing more than typical Hollywood marketing propaganda. Add to that, the `cool movie trailer voice guy' on the radio advertisements describing George Clooney's character as `an assassin who lived in the shadows' and an audio clip of Clooney shouting `Who's side are you on?!' - and you're sitting in a bathtub of lies and disappointment. That line of dialogue was definitely voiced by Clooney, but never appears in this film.  All these things mentioned, are not to imply that I didn't enjoy the film.

To call The American an action film would be to call The Bourne Identity a comedy. It's a drama with a gentle nod in the direction of being a thriller. It's an artsy film; long drawn out sequences of following the central character around doing normal everyday things like working out, driving, and walking down the street. There is little to no music in tow and very lean dialogue throughout. There - now you can stop reading and go see The Expendables if this isn't what you're looking forward to. Big Clooney fan like myself? Good - keep reading.

George Clooney stars as, you guessed it - `the American', complete with all the glory of the most American of American names, particularly on the silver screen; Jack. Jack is an assassin who has grown weary of the lifestyle. The film opens with him on holiday with his Swedish lover. I won't reveal what happens, but I will tell you that it ignites the entire momentum of the film, and is the first of several unanswered questions the movie fails to provide. The one I'm talking about here being, why did he handle the situation in Sweden the way that he did? He expresses later that `she had nothing to do with it.' So why then? Who knows though; others may not have as many questions as I did.

Because of the event in Sweden, Jack takes shelter in Italy. Why Italy? I don't know. Once there however, he is offered a new job by his employer, over the phone. It's clear from the get-go that Jack is trained in combat and is a skilled marksman. But the only proof he was an assassin comes from his boss telling him there is a mark and that he won't have to pull the trigger this time. Jack accepts the job.

What is the job if he is not to kill this time around?; to construct the ultimate rifle for a client to do the killing herself. She wants a rifle with the power of a machine gun, but that can be silenced as much as possible. The scenes showing how Jack constructs this device were among some of my favorites.

Jack forms two important relationships. One is with a woman named Clara (Violante Placido) who is a prostitute, and the second is a Catholic Priest. A rare combination of company to keep, I know.

The relationship with the girl becomes a romance and is handled perfectly by both actors and the filmmakers. They deliver the hottest love scene of the year, as well as extraordinarily well acted scenes, often without dialogue being exchanged.

At least from what I could tell, the priest is merely in the film for us to learn more about Jack's character. We do so by way of secondhand subtext found in the Father confessing the sins of his past to Jack, while Jack stays quiet - no doubt having dabbled in the same muck. Oh yeah, the priest is also there so that Clooney can look at the camera in an extreme close-up and deliver the gnarly one-liner, ""I don't think God's very interested in me, Father.""

There are way too many things that are left unexplained; such as why there are men after Jack, wanting him dead, and why jack became an assassin in the first place. He claims, ""Everything I've done, I've had good cause to do."" But I hardly buy that he honestly believes that.

Also, why did he not make a move on the woman he is sculpting the weapon for? She was clearly interested and he was constantly checking her out and his relationship with Clara had not yet blossomed. The only thing I have is maybe he doesn't mix business with pleasure? But then why the temptation in the story? We needed more answers. And what was the deal with the butterflies? I get the parallel, but what was Jack's fascination with them? I have one theory, but I'll leave that one for you to figure out.

The thing The American has that most other films in theaters right now lack, is amazing cinematography; definitely some of the best I have seen this year. The camera tells the story. There are some really terrific shots and we are constantly following Jack through blind cornered alleys in the elegant Italian villas and the camera gives us the sense that there is someone lurking around every corner; and every so often someone is. Most films use music to give these scares away to us prematurely, while The American holds you in silence until we jump when Clooney's character does; that's good cinema.",1285286400,13,5215,4.542643923240938
4289210,1,B0049EVR32,"I've been a George Clooney fan for years and, as such, have come to accept that you don't quite know what you may get from one movie to the next.  Some have been quite good; others pretty forgetable...  This one, though, is more  unforgiveable...

Part of the problem is the trailer, which I found misleading.  This is neither an action film nor a thriller - as the trailer infers - but more of a drama.

The rest of the problem is the film is pretty uneven and ends rather inexplicably and abruptly.  After enduring all the pensive moments and dragging pace of this film, it wraps things up in a matter of seconds.

I saw the movie with a couple friends and we all looked at each other at the end and said the same thing - ""Is that it?!?""  And after processing what we'd just sat through, we came to the same conclusion: we're done with Clooney films.  This one was too great a sucker punch and too much a waste of time.

Sorry, George!",1284422400,6,937,4.267045454545454
4289211,1,B0049EVR32,"This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen.  It starts out slow.  I kept expecting it to pick up speed and to find out what George Clooney was doing.  I was disappointed on both counts.  Clooney's character appears to be an extremely dull version of James Bond.  He can't hold a conversation, never responds with more than five words, speaks in a monotone, and he lacks anything resembling a personality.  Being that he is a tedious person, he needs to pay for sex.  Inexplicably, one of the prostitutes is attracted to this aging, boring man.  Presumably this has something to do with the sexual skills he demonstrates in an embarrassing soft porn scene and the fact that he's a good tipper.  We see their relationship flower during ten minutes of togetherness during which Clooney remains inarticulate.  We are never clued into what's happening in this movie.  People keep trying to kill Clooney and he is pretty good at killing them first.  We see him assemble a lot of guns; at times the movie reminded me of an instructional film that one might watch in shop class.  At the end, Clooney delivers some sort of envelope, receives a big wad of cash, and then his boss wants to kill him.  One can't help but wonder why his boss didn't just FedEx the envelope.  There are probably details in the book that would have made sense of this nonsense.  Apparently the screenwriters missed the class where it was explained that they should assume the audience didn't read the book and that the script needs to explain what's going on.",1284163200,11,1531,4.656716417910448
4289212,5,B0049EVR32,"Who would have thought that Hollywood could produce a taut murder-thriller without slamming every plot point down our throats? But there you have it: that's THE AMERICAN.

George Clooney, whom I usually enjoy more in his comedic or semi-serious roles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B00003CXRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burn-After-Reading/dp/B001JIE7JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burn After Reading</a>&nbsp;being two of my recent favorites) pulls in a dark, interesting, and dangerous character as Jack, a weapons man/hitman who's retirement from his chosen profession is proving extremely difficult.

Making friends is risky to both Jack and those he likes, as we witness early on in the film what he's forced to do to a woman whose innocence means nothing when Jack is discovered in a Swedish hideout. Forcing Jack to leave, he travels to Italy where he's told to lay low and wait for instructions. And when the instructions come, the audience can feel those pin-pricks of caution raising on their necks.

The great thing about The American is that Clooney is truly the only recognizable face for many U.S. film-watchers. But the rest of the cast are just as intense as Clooney's character. Great silences and moments of boredom are punctuated alongside moments of terrible aggression and death. And there's also sex, love, and priestly friendship intertwined.

It's rare nowadays to find something like The American showing in U.S. cities, but most of us should be very glad it's here. Harkening back to Hitchcock days (but with a modern bent), this movie almost certainly would've never seen the light of the Western hemisphere had it not been for Clooney's pretty-boy face taking front and center stage. But as recognizable as Clooney's face is, it is NOT a typical Clooney role. Here we get the actor stretching himself into new (and greater) territory. I swear this movie had the fewest lines I've ever heard in a major Hollywood production; and I'm thankful for that because it helped up the tension.

Indeed, it is the film's tension that drives the entire plot. We see and feel the battles raging within Jack as he's forced to decide whether to kill someone he's growing close to, or to let them live and risk his own life ...again. We also believe we know what's going to happen, and most of the time you'll be correct, but that it doesn't take away from the tension/impact of the movie shows how well put together this film truly is.

Those looking for a kind of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bourne-Identity/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bourne Identity</a>&nbsp;style flick are going to be sorely disappointed if they think this is in-line with that action-driven drivel. So be prepared for something very different. And very good.",1284163200,11,2985,5.742081447963801
4289213,1,B0049EVR32,"I always thought I could watch George Clooney sleep. I finally got a chance to test this theory when I went to see him sleepwalk through The American. Cloony assumes a weird chewing tic which I think is supposed to be sexy or something but is very distracting. In fact, he chews more than he speaks, which is probably a good thing since the film's dialogue is mostly grunts, sighs and cryptic three word sentences. What was he thinking? Maybe a chance to shoot a film in Italy close to his Bellagio villa had something to do with it. This is what Clooney does in the movie -- he walks down the identical cobbled street a dozen or more times, drives down the same hill over and over again, lies in bed, wakes up from nightmares, stares, twitches, drinks wine, and chews. There is one pathetic chase scene, and one hot sex scene. The beginning is better than the end but neither make any sense. There is no backstory and don't expect to ever be able to figure out what's going on because the film makes no attempt at plot, meaning, or visual delight. I have been a stalwart fan of Clooney since ER. I think he's handsome, funny and I am jealous of his girlfriend. But after The American I am beginning to wonder if he is just another pretty, if aging, face. Deadpan acting, no matter how attractive the actor, is always a copout especially in what is purported to be a thrill.",1283990400,5,1374,4.392156862745098
4289214,5,B0049EVR32,"""The American"" is a superbly crafted, visually captivating and subtle character driven drama with an incredibly 70's European style and sensibility. Be warned those looking for an action filled generic thriller will be severely disappointed. This is an artful character study about a troubled assassin nearing the end of what we can tell to be a long career. The general tone of the film mirrors that of the characters personality, a tense and emotionally reserved perfectionist. There is not too much emotion through much of the film because like its main character it is hard for him and the film to open up, or let anyone in. This is probably the most suspenseful film I have seen this year. It becomes hard to trust anyone he meets and I found myself becoming just as paranoid as he was at times. The performances were all wonderful, this was the most reserved I have seen Clooney since ""Syriana"". He played the character with such subtly and depth. I thought the end was fantastic. I felt it was the only fitting conclusion to this story. Although this ending isn't the most original, with the help of Corbijn's meticulous story telling and Clooney's performance I found it to be quite upsetting.

I can completely understand why some do not like this film but I absolutely loved it. I thought it was so fascinating and so well crafted. It was shot so beautifully and felt so much like it could have been a film by Jean-Pierre Melville. I can easily understand any comparison to ""Le Samourai"" because they really are very similar. I couldn't disagree more with what a lot of critics have said about this but I can understand that is just isn't for everyone. For me, it is easily the best film I have seen so far this year.",1283990400,99,1727,4.643790849673203
4289215,2,B0049EVR32,"I expected a lot more from this movie and I was disappointed.  The camera work and acting were superb, and the scenery beautiful, but the pace was very slow.  The main problem was that the story was not plausible or compelling - very little actually happened, and what eventually transpired in the end made no sense.  Not even the development and interactions of those stylish and mysterious characters could make up for the pedestrian and meaningless plot.  (BTW, I dare you to try shipping an M-14 in a film tube to a place like that in Italy or set up a gunsmithing shop with loading dies, mercury, etc. by making one trip to an auto repair garage.)  Jack was a very lonely and troubled man, and George Clooney seemed to be very comfortable in that role.  The  makers of this film must have thought that the audience is supposed to develop an emotional connection with someone like Jack, a top-notch professional ""doing his job"", because of the following:  1. The assasination business is way cool;  2. Jack encountered new circumstances that resulted in his eventual transformation;  3. Jack was played by none other than George Clooney.",1283904000,4,1141,4.775510204081633
4289216,3,B0049EVR32,"If there was ever a need for a three-and-a-half-star rating, it's for Anton Corbijn's ""The American."" The movie manages to lift itself out of mediocrity, but just barely. After a suitably shocking beginning by a frozen Swedish lake, the movie goes into hibernation with George Clooney, playing a hit man and gunsmith whose shadowy boss (Johan Leysen) orders him to lay low in a sleepy Italian hill town to await further orders.

Corbijn and screenwriter Rowan Joffe make the point that Clooney's life is dullness punctuated by violence; unfortunately, in the first half, they make it all too well. However, the film gains in interest as Clooney begins to wonder just who and what he can trust. Are supposedly friendly people gunning for him, or is his paranoia working overtime?

""The American"" is a throwback to the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, featuring antiheroes with mysterious pasts and bleak futures. It has several redeeming features; Paolo Bonacelli gives an interesting performance as an elderly, world-weary priest, and Martin Ruhe captures some glorious photography of the Italian countryside and of the naked flesh of Violante Placido, an actress with the same ripe beauty as the young Isabella Rossellini. As for Clooney, he doesn't give his best performance here, but it's the performance the material calls for. ""The American"" is no masterpiece, but it's a decent movie of its type.",1283817600,5,1402,5.144736842105263
4289217,4,B0049EVR32,"""The American"" is one of the slowest paced action/thriller films I've seen in a long time. In the beginning scenes in Sweden we see the killer instincts of its protagonist, Jack (George Clooney), who is an efficient killing machine. Jack goes on the run to Italy where he receives his orders in succinct telephone messages from a devious double-dealing Pavel.
He goes to a mountain town in Abruzzi where we see that Jack is losing his edge, his mojo. He's beginning to crave human contact and love which can get him in trouble. He's an armorer who is making a precision sniper rifle for a female assassin. How he gets the necessary equipment in his apartment is a mystery in itself. There are long passages demonstrating his gun-making skills. He's a very clever gunsmith but an ineffective human being. He falls in love with a prostitute, and slowly through his friendship with the local priest he has an epiphany. He's haunted and hunted. It has some very erotic, steamy scenes.
Lately as in ""Up in the Air"", Clooney has been taking these parts of men with ice in their veins, soulless entities, loners who learn too late that they can no longer reach out to get human contact and redeem themselves. Jack is basically a sociopath seeking solace and love.
The movie has great photography and fine views of the Italian mountain region, but like Jack viewers may find something lacking.",1283817600,28,1385,4.75103734439834
