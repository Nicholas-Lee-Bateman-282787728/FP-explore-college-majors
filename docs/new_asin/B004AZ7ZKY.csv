4312801,5,B004AZ7ZKY,"I've loved this movie for a very long time and Charles Bronson plays what is probably my favorite acting role he's ever done, besides ''Harmonica'' in Once Upon A Time In The West. The addition of the other movie isn't much of an addition but it's not as bad as some others have claimed, in my opinion. I've only watched it once and that was enough for me. However I've watched Death Hunt at least twenty times, because it never gets old.",1342137600,7,438,4.353658536585366
4312802,5,B004AZ7ZKY,"I really enjoyed this rare thriller with excellent performances from Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, and Carl Withers. Shot in the Frozen wilds, the story is compelling.
An additional bonus is Butch and Sundance with great actor Tom Berringer. Buy this combo!",1323561600,3,256,5.2682926829268295
4312803,4,B004AZ7ZKY,"This is an economical way to obtain Death Hunt which is one of Bronson's best films.
Bronson is pursued by Lee Marvin-a RMP in snowy northern Canada for a crime
he did not commit. It is a tale of survival against long odds. Better than
his Death Wish series (except maybe #1). Plenty of action/violence. I haven't
watched the 2nd feature yet;if it's good,my overall rating would move to 5 stars.",1306800000,12,395,4.577464788732394

Now, on to Death Hunt. This one I give 4 stars. If you are a Charles Bronson fan, you will like this. Lots of action, suspense, and scenery. Lee Marvin was good. Good supporting cast (although I think Angie was just there for eye candy). Watch this film. It is entertaining!",1422316800,,400,4.647887323943662

Forget the actual history - this is the way it should have been.  This bargain packet is the best way to see this movie for the first dozen times. People like me will go to the individual blu-rays.  Quality here is very good and in widescreen.  Get it!  There will never be another Bronson.  Nowadays we are likely to see Benedict Cumberbatch in POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SCAVENGER HUNT.

4312859,5,B004AZ7ZKY,Good films to watch. Butch & Sundance: Early Days/ Death Hunt are two good movies. Death Hunt is the real one I wanted to get. It is worth the money.,1390262400,,149,4.0
4312860,5,B004AZ7ZKY,"Death Hunt is a very entertaining western with two great actors, Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin.  It is suspenseful, and thrilling with awesome scenery of snow covered mountains in Canada near the turn of the century. Butch and Sundance tells the story of the early career of Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid.",1389052800,2,309,4.830188679245283
4312861,4,B004AZ7ZKY,"I bought this set for the film, Death Hunt.  Death Hunt is a well-filmed adventure set in the 1930s Canadian Yukon Territory.  based on the largest manhunt conducted by the Royal Canadian Police.  The two protagonists are played by Charles Bronson (in one of his best performances) and Lee Marvin.  Bronson plays a hermit trapper, Albert Johnson and Marvin plays RMC Sergeant Millen.  The two respect each other but are spurned on by a desire to survive and escape for Johnson and justice and duty for Millen.  The cinematography is fantastic in this tale of injustice and mob justice.  The film is helped by a sturdy cast of supporting actors that includes: Andrew Stevens, Carl Weathers, Ed lauter, Angie Dickinson (eye candy), Scott Hylands, William Sanderson, August Schellenberg and henry Beckman. Sit down and enjoy an old-fashioned action/adventure movie.

The second film is a possible prequel to Butch and Sundance: The Early Days classic movie.  It stars William Katt and Tom Berenger and is a good western chronicle of the two bandits early years. The supporting class includes veteran actors like Jeff Corey, John Shuck, Peter Weller, Brian Dennehy, Christopher Lloyd, Jill Eikenberry, Noble Willingham and patrick Stewart.",1387324800,,1235,5.196969696969697
4312862,5,B004AZ7ZKY,I love Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin movies. Put them both in the same movie (Dirty Dozen and Death Hunt) and you get greatness.,1377734400,,129,4.416666666666667
4312863,4,B004AZ7ZKY,"Although both have previously been released on DVD in the US separately by Anchor Bay, Shout Factory's Region 1 NTSC DVD offers a decent value for money double-bill.

Having made his elegiac and wistful look at the dying days of one legendary outlaw a few years earlier with Robin and Marion, Richard Lester ended the seventies with an amiable look at the beginning of another pair of outlaws' career in the engaging and surprisingly entertaining Butch and Sundance: The Early Days. Lester may have regarded the film as a `Victorian adventure' rather than a Western, but don't let that fool you: it's an entertaining though highly episodic oater that celebrates the outlaw of movie folklore with its tongue not too far in its cheek rather than grimly deconstructing the myth as was the fashion in the late 70s. It only offers a few hints that time already is running out in the form of Joe Lefors' lawman, introduced with a shot of his iconic straw hat but here just another sheriff leading an easily discouraged posse rather than the relentless nemesis of the George Roy Hill film, and our two heroes are in their prime rather than living on borrowed time. Here one of the biggest problems they face is coming up with a suitable outlaw name for Henry Longabough and creating the right kind of legend to ensure their popularity.

Tom Berenger and William Katt may not be another Paul Newman and Robert Redford but they do a fair approximation of what their Butch and Sundance could have been like when they first teamed up. Katt in particular has Redford's Sundance Kid mannerisms and delivery down to a fine art and there are some great faces in the supporting cast - Brian Dennehy John Schuck, Vincent Schiavelli, Christopher Lloyd, Elya Baskin - and yes, that is the director as startled onlooker in the hearse scene. The film sags a bit in the middle where a bullet wound leads to a period of going straight that gets in the way of the fun, but elsewhere the stars are likeable, the robberies are funny and often ingenious with an enjoyable train robbery finale, the script often witty and there's fine photography by Laszlo Kovacs, convincing production design from Brian Eatwell and a nice Patrick Williams score. A flop in its day, it now stands as Lester's last entirely satisfactory film before the confused mess of Cuba and his lucrative Superman sendups ended his creatively winning streak that held for most of the 70s.

Teaming up Dirty Dozen alumni Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin as the `Mad Trapper' Albert Johnson and the Mountie on his trail in the wastes of the Yukon, Death Hunt is a decent rather than great manhunt movie from the appropriately named Peter Hunt, who puts his experience of shooting on ice from OHMSS to good use. Very loosely based on the biggest manhunt in Canada's history, Bronson's reclusive loner gets on the wrong side of Ed Lauter and his assorted yahoos when he forces him to sell his injured fighting dog. Things escalate, dead bodies accumulate and after a failed siege of his log cabin leaves him on the run across the Rocky Mountains, the whole thing blows up into a media circus as various desperate types try to claim the $1000 reward on his head while Marvin tries to bring him back alive. With its protagonist who just wants to be left alone hunted by a professional who respects him while the mob is baying for a piece of his flesh, in some ways it can be seen as a 1930s-set First Blood, which it beat to the screen by a year, though it's less over the top and has less action than you might expect (it's not until the last third that the manhunt really starts). It's the most polished and well crafted of Bronson's 80s films, benefiting from a decent budget and supporting cast, Carl Weathers, Maury Chaykin and William Sanderson among them, though Angie Dickinson, reunited with her Point Blank co-star, is wasted in a nothing part as a prospector's widow whose sole purpose in the film seems to be to lower the testosterone level and add a bit more star power. If it never quite hits the highs, both stars are on good form and it works well enough as a Saturday Nighter to forgive the many huge liberties it takes with the facts.

Both films are in their original 1.85:1 ratios with only their respective trailers as extras. Print quality is decent but not outstanding, with Death Hunt clearly superior to Cornerstone/Palladium's UK DVD release, which is a standards conversion from NTSC to PAL, which means a softer picture and occasional blurring that's inferior to the US and German releases. Fans of Death Hunt might want to look out for the German PAL DVD and Blu-ray releases (released as Yukon but carrying the US title on the film itself), which goes rather better on the extras front with with a radio broadcast of the film's press conference with the stars, with Lee Marvin on dryly amusing form as he takes over the MC's duties because Judith Crist got stuck in traffic!",1374796800,,4939,4.673563218390805

4312865,5,B004AZ7ZKY,Great double feature. My favorite of the 2 is Death Hunt starring Charles Bronson. A real classic that I started watching when I was younger with my dad.

4312866,4,B004AZ7ZKY,"A great movie (""Death Hunt"") with a lot of authenticity for the period; excellent acting except for Angie (who never could act anyway).  This story takes some poetic license from events which occurred in Canada in the '30's; read the book (something about the mad trapper of Rat River) if you want a more accurate version.  ""Butch and Sundance"" is 3 Stars; not a great story, but at least the actors look a lot like Paul and Robert as younger men.",1361664000,3,447,4.506172839506172
