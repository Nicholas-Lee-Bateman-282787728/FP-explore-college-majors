7931757,4,B000056BOZ,"tom martinez was never a true member of THE ORDER,he joined a group of men who talked about the wrong of the white race and nothing was being done about it,then he was aproached by this guy in the movie walter west it was never proven there was a walter west, then it portraied bob mathews as a pedophile that liked to watch race mixing porn that is absurd, i think he tried to make his self look good to get out of trouble for passing out fake bills.and then the alan berg murder,the courts said there was no proof that the order had anything to do with it.i had written to the order and they said that what they herd it was more of a joke than anything.so watch it is good story but its not all true the book silent brotherhood is the most accurate info ouy there and bruce c pierce and richard scatarri both order members said they loved the book. there address are all over the net write them you will learn alot on what can talk about and may be learn about yourself. oh and the names in the movie were changed",1179964800,9,1015,4.1313131313131315
