5891363,5,B00E5MIMYK,"I thought this was going to be more of a typical film devoted to the homecoming of an war veteran, but it turned out to be a very interesting story of the veteran having to investigate the case of his girlfriend's murder. The acting is solid, but not any over the top performances that would take away from the authenticity of having the story happen in a small town, with the crooks bring right at the top of the political and law enforcement chain! An excellent drama.",1379548800,8,470,4.413793103448276

5891365,1,B00E5MIMYK,"Absolutely the worst movie I've watched in years.

Anybody who has been in the military will retch and scream in rage at the douche actor playing a decorated Army Staff Sergeant.  He wears his uniform like some rag bag homeless person only with less pride.  Don't these actors even care for one second to actually try and put forth a credible performance?

The acting was wooden, painful and embarrassing to watch.  I kept waiting for the movie to turn the corner but it never did, it only descended into even worse territory.

As a vet some of the themes mentioned resonated well with me but they were too thinly delivered; it was frankly looking like a diatribe in drag pretending to be a movie.

I cut sling load about 35 minutes in and that is because I am pretty patient.

I could have forgiven the lousiness of the acting and the script if the guy playing the Staff Sergeant would have shown up with an Army haircut and had asked an actual Soldier to take five minutes and explain to him how to wear the uniform (and how not to).  Simply put, disgracing the uniform was the last straw.",1468108800,,1091,4.442211055276382
5891366,1,B00E5MIMYK,"Iranian anti-Americans 'star' in this ultra boring movie to try to exalt obama with the most laughable propaganda piece ever. The script makes a father Mayor and Sheriff to be arms dealers who murder the Mayor's daughter in order to cover up their 'creating jobs' in small town America by selling arms to muslim terrorists and giving away American soldiers' locations to them for execution so they could sell more arms. To top off the propaganda junk, the movie's personality is as dry as possible and the actors have to be among the worst one could ever find on the planet.",1466985600,,574,4.693069306930693

5891374,1,B00E5MIMYK,"About eight minutes into this turkey and I have seen nothing which would entice a viewer into continuing to watch.  The opening scenes are shot with very poor, irritating camera work which the director must have believed to be artsy.  Then a ""convoy"" of empty trucks is attacked by a group of incompetents.  A small group, led by an unidentified bearded man, rushes to the aid of the convoy by driving into the ambush.  The air force is finally called in so some of them survive despite the stupidity.  During the fighting a point is made that the attackers are pirates, not Afghanis.  Pirates?  This is land locked Afghanistan, not coastal Somalia.  But maybe this explains why they can't hit much of anything at what amounts to point-blank range and why they shoot by standing in full view of the Americans who also can't hit much.
At about twenty five minutes in, nothing else has happened.  Kent, an apparent survivor of the ambush, gets out of a hospital, has a long, pointless conversation with his sister and visits the wife of one of his deceased buddies.  The wife accurately informs him that A.J. wasn't just Kent's friend, he was her man and her daughter's father.  Maybe she thought Kent a little slow and that he may not understand this.  The rant goes downhill from there though we do learn that Kent's girlfriend was killed in a car wreck a month earlier.  We also learn that there may be a conspiracy to cover-up...what we don't yet know.  We do know that the deceased girlfriend's father is the mayor and is running for governor. Also the sheriff isn't a straight shooter.
I watched a little more and learned that the mayor is an evil munitions manufacturer; Christians are committing adultery & fathering children with their nannies (doesn't say anything about what non-Christians are doing);  teachers, firemen & police officers are losing their pensions because of bad state investments; there is a gun walking scandal and fraking is contaminating the ground water. Also the population of this town is about 1000 people.  Unfortunately there are about fifty minutes left in the movie but I don't have to eat the rest of the egg to know that it is rotten.  Even the guy playing Kent is avoiding eye contact and his body language is radiating discomfort.  I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1457308800,3,2345,4.733990147783251

5891379,1,B00E5MIMYK,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years.  The plot was absurd and contrived; the acting was poor; and the editing sought to assemble a story where none existed.  Perhaps this movie was fabricated from rejected editing room footage from ""Shooter,"" ""Lord of War,"" ""Tropic Thunder,"" and ""Armadillo.""

Even a chimera like that, however, would have a measure of authenticity.  This movie has absolutely none:  it is a complete and total fake.  Amazon should not carry rubbish like this.",1441238400,,494,4.891566265060241

The actors were awful, wooden and made me not care about ANY of them; the story was idiotic and predictable, it jumped from scene to scene without much explanation at all and I just thought the movie was a complete waste of time! The only redeeming thing was that it was free!! I would've been very upset if I'd have paid to sit through that boring story AND had to pay for it, as well!
It's strange, but when I see that most people hate something, I usually end up liking it and vice-versa.. So, I'm still gonna keep trying to find the ""diamonds in the rough"", but for me, this wasn't one of them!",1428364800,2,726,4.268115942028985

5891406,1,B00E5MIMYK,This film was of low quality and had poor audio.  The story could have been good but was a little hard to follow especially since it was hard to understand what was said a lot of the time. The background music was a little loud in places which made it hard to hear what was said. The fee we paid to rent was a little much for this quality of a film.,1401926400,3,349,3.8472222222222223
