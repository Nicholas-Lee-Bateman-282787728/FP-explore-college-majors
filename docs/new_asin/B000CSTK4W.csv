2473496,4,B000CSTK4W,"This was good for a review of the restoration of the Grand Central Station.  However, I was looking for more of a history, so it wasn't exactly what I wanted.  Preservation is of HUGE importance anyway, and I am sure that those who have used the building will thoroughly enjoy it.",1245024000,,280,4.470588235294118
2473497,5,B000CSTK4W,I spent several months on an engineering evaluation of the train platforms at Grand Central Station and found the Nat Geo video to be accurate and enterntaining.,1232409600,,161,5.0
2473498,2,B000CSTK4W,"Even better: rent something else.

This documentary suffered from a lack of a script editor and a video editor. If you're over 30, you'll find the nonstop MTV style swooping camera movement nauseating. Suitable for a documentary on rollercoasters, not on a building.

The same phrases are repeated too many times and should have been cut. They should at least be consistent. You will lose count of how many times they tell you how many people a day pass through the station. And the number they tell you keeps changing. Cmon.

I found very little substance and at least 30 minutes of useless and repetitive fluff in this documentary. Very disappointing.",1216598400,8,653,4.864864864864865
2473499,5,B000CSTK4W,"A complete look at this national landmark, Inside Grand Central is a loving look at a piece of America's culture. The station was built in the era of railroads when automobiles were new and airplanes were just being invented. It was massive and expensive; it also made boatloads of money for the Vanderbilts. Through the years, the popularity of trains began to decline, and by the 1960s and 70s, Grand Central Station was more frequently used as a refuge for the homeless than a transportation depot. It was supposed to be torn down like its rival station Penn Station. Fortunately, an uprising kept this from happening.

A documentary for many interests, this National Geographic presentation examines many aspects of the station from the history, the restoration, it technological advancements, how it runs, its security against terrorism, and future plans. None of these topics are covered as thoroughly as they could be, but as a general interest documentary, this one is excellent. It really shows why it was so important that Grand Central was saved from demolition.",1209168000,5,1073,5.096590909090909
2473500,4,B000CSTK4W,"If you're interested in Grand Central Terminal (as this author is) this is a great resource.  You'll learn the history, cultural context and function of Grand Central.  The story covers the birth, near death, and rebirth of this great New York icon.

It's enjoyable, an easy watch, and a great learning experience.  Perhaps all that's missing is a bit more trivia.  This is for the Grand Central fanatic after all!  For the non-buff, this would probably be a waste of time.",1200182400,,473,4.777777777777778
2473501,5,B000CSTK4W,"My mother was from the Bronx;  I grew up on the south-shore of Long Island;  returned to NYC many times over the past 5 decades; wound down my international career living within NY walking distance from Grand Central.  Over the course of my lifetime I always appreciated the Terminal for its complexity and convenience, but not until I bought this as a gift for my son who is now a graduate student at NYU,  did I appreciate it for it's secrets and beauty. If, like me, you love NYC and solutions for moving the masses  efficiently and reliably,  you really need to see this.",1178496000,10,575,4.480769230769231

8101999,5,B000CSTK4W,"National Geographic's DVD celebration of Grand Central Terminal reminds me why GCT is one of my favorite buildings in the whole wide world. Every time I lament the death of Pennsylvania Station I quickly give thanks that GCT still survives and looking better than ever...and the best is yet to come when the East Side Connection brings LIRR trains into the heart of the city.

The informative narrative gives a historical overview of the Grand Central and its relationship to New York City.  It also exposes hidden secrets about the station never before revealed.

What the video doesn't reveal are the dark, dirty, and dangerous train platforms...a sharp and bitter contrast to the sparkling interior of main hall. Walking to and from Metro North trains on these grimy platforms often feels unsafe. This is a security risk that also deserves a major renovation.

One could literally eat off the floor under the train sheds of Paddington and St. Pancras in London. I wouldn't suggest trying that in Grand Central, Penn Station, 30th Street, or Washington Union Station.",1409616000,2,1069,5.022598870056497
8102000,4,B000CSTK4W,An excellent video of a historic edifice in New York. The Grand Central was on the verge of demolition but Jacqueline Kennedy lobbied  unrelenting to maintain the historic terminal,1386115200,,180,5.206896551724138
8102001,3,B000CSTK4W,"I somehow expected that this volume would have more about the ""nuts and bolts"" operations of GCT, both in the past and at present",1369612800,2,129,4.416666666666667
8102002,5,B000CSTK4W,What a fascinating historical (and current) account of this landmark.  My wife and I cannot wait to revisit it next trip to NYC.,1363824000,,128,4.565217391304348
8102003,5,B000CSTK4W,I received great service & it was a really good DVD. I am a railfan & would recommend this to any other railfan,1355270400,,111,3.869565217391304
8102004,2,B000CSTK4W,"I love Grand Central Terminal.  I love National Geographic.  I did not love this documentary.  It is not up to the standards of either GCT or NG.  Although the cinematography was wonderful, the writing was terrible.  Transitions were abrupt and nonsensical.  The attempt to combine a chronological structure with a topical one, made the end result choppy.  The reuse and over use of the same footage got to be annoying.  I thought I was going to get an inside view, and although there was some behind the scenes footage, it wasn't enough to justify the title.  It would have been better to have stuck with a true behnd the scenes look at the current Grand Central, and forget the history.  Or, conversely, give the history and forget the behind the scenes.  And hire a better writer!",1301270400,4,783,4.6838235294117645
8102005,5,B000CSTK4W,"What a fascinating video - so well-prepared and well-documented!  An inviting look into building this American monument; the conflicts that nearly prevented it from being raised; the history of the materials, labor, energy and time consumed in the proces; the design of the entire area that houses Grand Central - a complex layout of paths and tracks underground used by so very many trains and  passengers daily; the levels of the station that contain businesses and other attractions for visitors to the station;  the SECRETS of the station, hidden for its most famous first visitor, but known to the people who work every day at Grand Central.  Every moment of the video was interesting to watch - I highly recommend it.",1252713600,,723,4.950413223140496
8102006,5,B000CSTK4W,I saw this video on TV several years back and have been dying to watch it again.  Very informative and it has many old videos and pictures of Grand Central Station.  An excellent video to watch and own.,1246233600,,202,4.2894736842105265
