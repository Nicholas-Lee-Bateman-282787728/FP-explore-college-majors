Viewer gets to see nice imagery of the activity around the river, including ritual bathing, ascetic practices, cremations, and portions of the Kashi Ganga Aarti ritual. However, there is no narration included, only filming. There are only three examples of short statements from residents informing the viewer about the cremation practices on the river. The rest of the film provides no interviews, explanations or narrative observations, so the experience of the viewer becomes  rather passive, with little opportunity to reflect on the complexities and contradictions of one of the most unique and fascinating cities in the world.",1437523200,,742,5.396551724137931
8435130,5,B000TDE3S8,"What a fantastic job on this movie! I have been to Varanasi twice, and it is exactly what I saw there... thanks for documenting India and preserving these images. India is changing all of the time, and someday Varanasi may not be like this, so it is a perfect documentary of the way things actually ARE there now. It brought back many memories... you got the shots that showed reality, as it exists now. Thanks again for such an accurate portrayal of this magical place!",1217203200,,470,4.541176470588235
8435131,5,B000TDE3S8,"This documentary is a beautiful expression of sprituality-a dimension of life in India rearly seen by Westerners.  It is truely a cinematic meditation. Highly recommended to spiritual seekers and travelers going to Varanasi, India.",1209772800,2,231,5.794117647058823
8435132,5,B000TDE3S8,"This film is is for those people who are not afraid to travel on paths less travelled. I am a film lover who appreciates visually strong storytelling as a real "" voice "" rather than someone holding my hand through the whole experience.  Remember those over narrated educational films they made us watch in high school ?  Varanasi really brings you into the ancient living landscape. The film is really about the rarely seen ancient and esoteric hindu death rituals at the river Ganges. While not an easy or entertaining subject, the unusual sounds and sights provoked in me a sense of timelessness almost as if the spirit of Varansi itself were witnessing the whole event. I'm looking forward to the other titles from this filmaker.",1209513600,3,732,4.801587301587301
8435133,1,B000TDE3S8,"This documentary is such a disappointment that there are no words to describe it. The director (who supposedly has training in making documentaries) spends hours and hours gazing at same tired, clich shots of the famous Ganges ghats, the camera is slow, boring, with no discourse or narrative to accompany the shots. I would have imagined that the director himself being from India would do a better job than panning the camera on burning ghats, crazy holy men, and other trifle items that perhaps, would be interesting to an outsider. Instead of bringing out the true nature of the Ganges ghats (the famous dance rituals on the river banks are so poorly shot that you pause to think if some amateur student had been employed to capture those shots). I am not just disappointed with this film, but I am angry as well. I would not recommend this film to anyone, ever.",1195084800,7,866,4.703947368421052
