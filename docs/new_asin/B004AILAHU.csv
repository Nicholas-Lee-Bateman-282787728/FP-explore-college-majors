8420274,1,B004AILAHU,"* < 1 Star *  This is a cheap copy of the SAWS flicks ... and personally, I hate that kind of mindless torture / horror.  And this flick was boring, too - the pace is way slow for this genre, the plot is muddy at best, acting is juvenile, and the sets look like a kid's 'haunted house' built for Halloween by your local Kiwanis Club.  There is no reason for this flick to have been made, and no reason for you to waste time and watch it.",1507420800,,437,3.8876404494382024

8420276,4,B004AILAHU,"For a low budget film, this one really packs a punch.  There is enough blood to make the audience feel the character's pain.  This film is dark and moody, with a concept that is truly disturbing.  What happens in this film makes it a psychological thriller that will stay with you.  The characters all have motivations for what they are doing, and the victims are a bunch of unique people.  They all act as you would expect in this situation, which helps the audience empathise with them, feel their pain and frustration.  The film plays out with twists and turns that are both believable and unexpected.  Despite a slow pace at the start, the film picks up speed once the violence begins.  This makes for a buildup of tension that drives the story to its conclusion.  A brutal exposition of what people are capable of doing to other people.",1300233600,3,841,4.590604026845638
8420277,4,B004AILAHU,"A worthwhile horror/thriller that is more complex than just a killer knocking off victims for some reason. The story is more about psychological torture than cold-blooded murder, and the victims are not just innocent lambs being led to the slaughter. The killers have a method to their madness and seem chillingly convinced of their righteousness. There was enough gore to keep me happy, but the best thing is that it wasn't over done. The blood-letting was restrained and effective. I thought the whole ride was pretty entertaining.",1298419200,3,533,5.137931034482759
