8259537,1,B0015R6VL4,"This is worse than my moms' boring home movies!  Very amateur filming and way too many flower shots.  My kids watch very little tv so when it is on it always holds their interest.  Not this one!  Even the music selections were not all good.  Don't waste your money!  Stick with Baby Einstein for simple entertainment and good music.  If you want education, Preschool Prep Company has the absolute best series for quality education and pleasing animation for young eyes and minds.  I didn't even bother donating this DVD, it went straight in the trash.",1357171200,,551,4.726315789473684
