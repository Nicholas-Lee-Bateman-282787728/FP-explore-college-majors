8276676,3,B001AD1NA2,"This is a gory movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation Satan film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring, this film would be a nasty classic.

Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse, and the ugly monster, this movie is a snoozer.

It's such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.

This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-Satan movie.",1385337600,6,612,4.350877192982456
8276677,4,B001AD1NA2,"[FEAST OF SATAN - (1971) - Widescreen presentation - Spanish, dubbed in English - (Krista Nell / Teresa Gimpera) - directed by Jose Maria Ellorienta AKA Joe Lacy, as credited here] This one opens with the lovely Hilda (Krista Nell of numerous Spanish horror flicks from the late 60's-mid 70's) arriving in a small town train station to meet officials due to a call she received regarding her younger sister. When the train arrives and her sister is taken off the train in a stretcher, she is catatonic and her hair has turned white, apparantly from shock or fright. The cause is unknown and she will be hospitalized, and Hilda checks into a hotel and begins searching for clues in hotels, restaurants, nightclubs, etc., eventually led to a yacht owned by the enigmatic Dr. Nescu, who has a taste for the ladies. His constant companion and comely secretary, Andrea, is present, and the good doctor is screwing another Eurobabe below deck.
  Nescu's a snakcharming hypnotist who dabbles in the occult, who soon enough has Hilda under his spell, though she's ill-advised to remain in his companionship by local Dr. Ferrer who has heard dark tales regarding other women in Nescu's company. She visits his castle anyway (ya gotta love the predictability in these flix) and things get typically gothic with all the mysterious hallways, dcor and antiquities, and he further enchants her even though she suspects him being implicated in her sister's condition. He has his man servant drive her back to her hotel while he and Andrea retire to an upstairs room, Nescu plays an organ out of 'The Phantom of the Opera' and the brunette he was 'servicing' on his yacht earlier walks in, there's an exterior cut, and we hear a shrill scream. (The lack of visible bloodshed and gore is the films main liability).

Andrea is waiting in Hilda's room when she gets back (presumably, another manifestation of the occult, 'cause this is a horror flick, not sci-fi, so time travel's out of the question) and implores her not to see Nescu again. Women being women, Hilda assumes Andrea just wants her out of the picture, so that's not gonna happen, not even when she's told that Nescu is a servant of the devil in search of his 'Sheba' (a female incarnation of the devil), a word she heard her sister mumble earlier. Hmmm... Needless to say, both Hilda and Andrea end up back at the castle in the clutches of the doctor; sadly, not for a mnage a trois, but something far more sinister. I can't say more without spoiling things, but we do get more backstory on Nescu and the root of his condition and penchant for the paranormal as well as a decent but predictable ending for this type of flick, but when you've seen as many of these flicks as I have, you could certainly do worse. A lot worse...  Alright, so it may not be a 'feast', let's call it a buffet or brunch, at least a solid snack or knosh, agreed?",1304380800,9,2886,4.64187866927593
