8132616,1,B000GI3RIS,"I felt this item was overpriced. The disc comes with two scenes. None of which are only fire. They both show a really ugly fireplace. I would look to another disc, but kudos to the guys who produced this. Probably took 2 hours in a basement and another hour marketing the cover, the cover looks better than the disc. The price on the box says 22 dollars. I think that is 21 dollars too much.",1168300800,6,391,4.226666666666667
