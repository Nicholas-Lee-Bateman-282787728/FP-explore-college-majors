8514486,1,B007CF79QY,"I was hoping that this instructional DVD would really help me to discover the full extent of the capabilities for the Montana 650T GPS. I was disappointed. This DVD is a remedial walk through of the most basic features of the device. Garmin does not provide a printed reference manual for the device; what they do have is an online manual that too only describes the basic features of their device. Being new to handheld GPS units, I bought the Montana first for its large viewing screen and its excellent reviews and second, to be able to enjoy a device that I can program exclusively to suit my specific needs for different activities. I am finding my way through the programming from learned experience with the 650T and by trial and error; not at all from any knowledge gained from this instructional DVD. Save your money and apply it towards 24K Topo maps instead. The description of this product was vague in what it provides to the user and my expectations of what I would get out of it were obviously way too high. To me this was a complete waste of time and money.",1344124800,6,1073,4.507692307692308
8514487,1,B007CF79QY,This is probably one of my worst cases of wasting money in a while. The DVD quality is very bad. Hope that you do not make the same mistake that I did. Good luck,1343347200,7,161,3.764705882352941
8514488,2,B007CF79QY,"I recently purchased this DVD and am not satisfied with it.  This DVD is only
40 Minutes long.  The DVD starts out with how to turn the Montana on. The advanced
section of this DVD only gives a basic introduction on how to create a route, how
to activate the tracking feature and a couple other basic points.  I personally
recommend the manual that is stored inside the Montana. After that, go to: YouTube.com,
and you will find all the information that you will ever need to get a working knowledge
of this Montana GPS.  The Garmin Montana has 10 profiles: Auto, Marine, Motorcycle, Geocaching,
etc.  When you turn this unit on, pick a profile, customize it and the unit will remember the
settings. By switching between profiles the Montana becomes a very versatile GPS.  Save this
$20.00 and put it toward a GizzMoVest case and a Anti-glare screen protectors.  This will
give the ultimate protection to your investment.  Also the unit will float with this case.
To sum it up on this DVD, I was expecting more, quite a bit more than what it contains.",1342915200,9,1051,4.612903225806452
