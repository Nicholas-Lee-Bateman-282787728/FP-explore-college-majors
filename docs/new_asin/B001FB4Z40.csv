3567490,5,B001FB4Z40,"The comprehensive review written by Sudeep Bose covers just about everything anyone might want to know about this extrarordinary DVD.  For anyone interested in learning about combat medicine in real combat situations, this instructional is a must.",1268956800,,247,5.675675675675675
3567491,5,B001FB4Z40,"In this DVD you will learn the basics of how to treat an injured man in the field after he experienced some trauma, such as a GSW to the head, chest or extremity. The author explains how to stop arterial blood loss with a tourniquet and Hemcon, and something called a CAT and ""Israeli Bandage"". The DVD goes a little beyond the basics with; an I.V. set preparation with a 3 step process that helps to simplify it, he calls it ""open/close-open/close-fill/empty"". It works well. He also includes combat scenarios that try to include a little reality based training. The end review and title cards throughout are also helpful for note takers like me.",1268870400,,647,4.684210526315789
3567492,5,B001FB4Z40,"Loved the DVD. well done and informative, very reality based.  I would recommend this to all my colleagues!",1268697600,,107,4.944444444444445
3567493,5,B001FB4Z40,"I am not a medical doctor but I do have some experience as a first responder. The DVD was excellent in covering the basics of trauma first aid. He does not talk about medical emergencies like cardiac arrest, fever, poisoning etc. The DVD is all about trauma and field treatment. After watching the DVD I wanted to make a first aid kit like he uses in the DVD for my car.",1268611200,3,370,4.225352112676056
3567494,5,B001FB4Z40,"I strongly feel that emergency workers in any area of emergency medicine can benefit greatly from this hour long DVD. I am not a combat soldier but rather a paramedic. While the title ""Israeli Combat Medicine"" may seem specific to combat, I was able to receive concise organized in-depth information that was clearly conveyed and articulated by a medical professional working in the field. I especially liked the trauma first aid kit and the studio they used for filming gave it a realistic backdrop.  From the basics like tying tourniquet to more complex treatments such as closing a sucking chest wound, this DVD covers it all with easy to follow steps in a variety of scenarios. Whether you are an EMS professional looking to broaden your knowledge base, are interested in joining the field of EMS, the military, police, or are looking for teaching material for emergency courses, I personally recommend ""Israeli Combat Medicine.""",1245628800,3,933,5.058441558441558
3567495,5,B001FB4Z40,"This DVD should be viewed by all members of a Special Ops team who face high probability of acute injuries from combat scenarios.  This DVD is focused on training a non-medical professional. Emphasis is on the staunching of blood flow from traumatic hemorrhage wounds and emergency situation first-response protocols.

Level: Basic | Intermediate

This is not an academic, educational DVD.  All the instruction sections are basic and pragmatic - CPR is not included.  The training is focused on conveying simple step-by-step instructions using hypothetical injury scenarios - a cut artery from knife laceration, amputated limb, gunshot wound to chest, etc...common injuries in combat settings.  Scene management | weapons control is emphasized along with core medical training.

This DVD is for tactical team members who do not have first responder training or who desire to hone their FR training with a DVD which emphasizes common combat wounds from actual ""hit"" to emergency treatment and ""packaging"" for civilian medical transport.  The level of information is basic but COMPLETE.

Injury scenarios include gunshot wounds, sucking chest wounds, amputations, arterial lacerations, and airway obstructions (#3 airway is used throughout the DVD).  Unlike most DVDs on the topic, self treatment equipment and methods are presented.  The brief introduction to IV prep is limited and basic to say the least, but I know of no one who will attempt to administer an IV with the exception of the team medic.

I loved the 4 hypothetical scenarios and the step by step response and treatment protocols.  No other DVD on the marketplace covers topics such as sterilization of an undercover operative for civilian transport nor weapons control prior to administration of first aid.

To emphasize, this DVD is not for the tactical medic, it is made for all the other team members.  The intent is for all team members to carry basic medical equipment and be able to perform first aid immediately upon acute injury of a team member.",1235088000,11,2019,5.226708074534161

8301602,3,B001FB4Z40,"Once again I am dispointed in training videos. This DVD is less than a basic first aid class that I teach to civilans. There are a few subject matter i.e. sterilizing the undercover victim, and securing the weapon that i don't mention in class, nut than again its for civilians, but this training DVD...........not worth the money spent.",1372118400,3,337,4.827586206896552
8301603,5,B001FB4Z40,Went above and beyond my expectation was a very good down and dirty was of doing an assessment and treatment,1348790400,,108,4.45
8301604,2,B001FB4Z40,"I don't know who the guys/gals are that are giving this thing 5 stars... it's a video of two guys haphazardly wandering through the treatment of a combat casualty. If you've ever been in the .mil world or had any serious training/experience with tactical EMS, and by serious I don't mean too serious, then you're wasting your time. It was so bad, my girlfriend was laughing at me for watching it and trying to get training value out of it. Literally... it's two guys standing around an abandoned building with a camcorder and fumbling through some ""scenarios"" that involve one guy standing in a doorway dressed differently 4 times and doing the same stuff over and over again. It's like a bad hip pocket training session.
Some of the information is dated, some of it is wrong, and some of it is so bizarre that I can't help but wonder how many casualties these guys have actually had their hands on. Some of the information is actually dangerous. Wrap a scalpel in some nitrile gloves so you can cut a guys clothes? Are you kidding me? I knew something was hokey when he said the three things essential for a special operations soldier to be good at were physical fitness, tactical medicine and hand to hand combat... half the wounds they treat are knife wounds, I can only assume it's from the hand to hand combat the casualty is doing with you while you're slashing him furiously with your scalpel trying to cut his jeans off.
Honestly, I think the other reviewers might be shells so this company can sell some gimmicky videos with the words ""Israeli Special Forces"" in it and turn a quick buck. Seriously, don't waste your time.",1303084800,51,1631,4.608247422680412
8301605,5,B001FB4Z40,"I would highly recommend Israeli Combat Medicine by Garret Machine.  Although this is critical for every soldier to know, I believe the information contained in this DVD would be helpful for anybody that could experience a traumatic scenario where people are severely injured.  Garret breaks it down into steps that anybody can understand.  I have trained with Garret before, and I can tell you he is very skilled.  I know I will refer to this DVD often.",1299974400,,454,4.857142857142857
8301606,5,B001FB4Z40,"After watching this DVD I think that it should be a mandatory training course for anyone who carries a gun for a living. The DVD it self is just a supplement, although a good one, but the course is where it's at.",1297814400,,212,4.071428571428571
8301607,5,B001FB4Z40,My uncle is a medic in the US army overseas and I got this for him as a gift in the collection package deal. He loved it.,1268956800,,121,3.5185185185185186
