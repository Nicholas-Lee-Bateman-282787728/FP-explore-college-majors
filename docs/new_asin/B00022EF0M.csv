8020430,4,B00022EF0M,"This a very good DVD to get about one of the world's greatest racing drivers ever, Brazilian Ayrton Senna. However, this is kind of a compilation of other perviously material realeased, mostly in VHS form. So, at least you have the advantage of getting the material in DVD.

Go for it if yu do not know so much about Senna.",1289952000,,323,4.383333333333334
8020431,5,B00022EF0M,"An extraordinary DVD video that shows the life of the master Senna inside and outside Formula one, from his own words and the words of his family and person who know him ver well.",1287446400,,179,4.294117647058823
8020432,1,B00022EF0M,"For a documentary about a driver, there's surprisingly little
driving footage in it. They only speak to about five different people about him! It's probably a cheap way to get easy money
from Senna fans , I only hope that the money they make from it will go to the brazilian kids the foundation was founded for(call me sentimental).
  The second film 'racing is in my blood' I already had on VHS,and it wasn't bad but....I already had it. I bought this
film 'right to win' looking for something new  but it's just a rehash of other documentaries I'd seen before and a weak version
at that. I would imagine, however, that the 'foundation' had problems getting access to footage and people in F1, being that there is  bad blood between Ecclestone (F1 tight fisted ruler) and the Senna family. Still , I won't be buying 'foundation' stuff again.
