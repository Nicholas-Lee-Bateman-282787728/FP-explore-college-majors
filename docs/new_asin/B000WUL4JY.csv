8225719,5,B000WUL4JY,This was an excellent dvd that had some great information.  Sandra really got into just about every details for constructing a jacket.  I am still a beginner and the instructions were fantastic and easy to follow.  This video is definitely worth buying.,1291680000,,253,4.976190476190476
8225720,5,B000WUL4JY,"This is a generous 2-hour video which begins with Sandra opening up about a dozen designer jackets to show how they have been constructed -- where interfacing has been placed, or something more substantial, or where seams have been sewn with twill tape to prevent stretching. She then goes on to describe her approach to various details of construction, such as where she interfaces, how to create a sleevehead and insert shoulder pads, how to bag a lining, using fusible thread to simultaneously decorate the lining seam with ribbon and fix the lining to the jscket, and using a chain to weight a hem. Just watching how she approaches sewing was very helpful to me and has made a difference in my own technique.  I have not made a jacket since watching this video, but am about to, and I am sure this video will make a big difference in the success of the project.

I recommend this video for intermediate sewers like myself in particular. I am concerned that beginners might be confused by the level of detail. Advanced sewers, however, might also enjoy seeing Sandra's solutions to the standard problems of jscket construction.",1255824000,5,1130,4.78974358974359

8225722,5,B000WUL4JY,I loved this DVD. It was easy to understand. The demos are clear and informative. Sandras' tips take a lot of the stress out of tailoring. You can see how much she loves sewing and how sincerely she wants to share her knowledge and skill. As a result of this DVD I ordered several of her others. Highly recommend Couture Jeans. I contacted her via her website and received a timely response which helpfully answered my questions. This is a must have if one wants to take their sewing to the next level. Worth every penny!,1195084800,16,521,4.4375
