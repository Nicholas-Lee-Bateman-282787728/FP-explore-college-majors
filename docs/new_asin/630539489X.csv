1029088,3,630539489X,"Not the best movie, but for a low budget film it was half deceant. The main girl is really pretty",1414540800,,97,3.9
1029089,2,630539489X,boring movie not worth viewing,1413244800,,30,5.2

1029092,1,630539489X,"What I thought would be a romantic comedy turned out to be a porn flick, and a lousy one. would give it a minus if I could",1401408000,2,122,3.5555555555555554
1029093,2,630539489X,"I remembered this from a movie channel back in the '80s but it doesn't hold up. While Carol Levy is beautiful and fun to watch, the story is plodding, and the sex is played more for (very poor) laughs than sensuality.",1395273600,,217,4.317073170731708
1029094,1,630539489X,"Tired story line. Mediocre acting. Not sexy, laughable. I kept waiting for improvement. It never happened. Take it off your watch list.",1386979200,,135,5.181818181818182
1029095,2,630539489X,"I am a big fan of Radley Metzger owning several of his finest movies, which was reason enough to buy this feature. Unfortunately this movie doesn't even begin to approach the level of the likes of ""Lickerish Quartet"", ""Camille 2000"", ""Score"" ore the hardcore features he made under the pseudonym Henry Paris. Great pity but even a master some times strikes out.",1381190400,4,361,4.838709677419355
1029096,2,630539489X,"Oh please. This is a ghastly film. I only bought it because I think the leading man, Victor Bevine, is totally hot and there is a long scene of him without his clothes. The lighting is somewhat dim, and there is nothing full frontal, but he is a fuzzy delicious morsel as ever was. Victor gives beefcake a very good name.",1365379200,2,321,4.278688524590164
1029097,2,630539489X,"For being a Metzger movie I expected a lot more! In the 70's he was a ""pioneer"" in erotic cinema, I thought that in the 80's he would go further, WRONG! The story is good and very original, but there is just not enough sex appeal throughout the movie, the few scenes are very ""unerotic"" and for being the 80's could have definately been more ""daring""!",1215734400,9,351,4.333333333333333
7889314,3,630539489X,"Story is fine, but quality of DVD transfer is weak.",1471651200,,51,4.2

7889316,1,630539489X,ok,1462492800,,2,2.0
7889317,5,630539489X,Great flash back to another time. Picture is clear. Sound is great. About  90 minutes long. In color. Story about princess that got to return favor call girl did for her years ago.  It has stood the test of time for me. Saw it originally at drive in. Audrey was the princess. Lucy was the call girl. Came packed well. Nothing damaged.,1432598400,,334,4.370967741935484

7889319,2,630539489X,seemed like someone could've guessed that neither was the right one,1430265600,,67,5.181818181818182
7889320,2,630539489X,poor quality all around. movies in the 30's were done better,1424390400,,60,4.545454545454546
7889321,1,630539489X,Very Very bad,1418342400,,13,3.6666666666666665
