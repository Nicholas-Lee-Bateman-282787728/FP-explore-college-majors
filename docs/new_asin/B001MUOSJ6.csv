8321897,4,B001MUOSJ6,"This surreal Catalan film opens to a starkly white and even more starkly empty art gallery.  No paintings.  No people.  Camera searching, searching, searching.

We are in the Mindanao Trench of galleries.  Finally the sole denison appears like one of those deep water fish, dark with a big mouth of 44 teeth.  It is a robot piano playing the Goldberg Variations.  The now rare Aeolian Pianola spinnet, once like bison, was the most prolific of American pianos.  In fact Aeolian holds the world record of pianos sold in a single year.  No wonder we find so many in the UK, Spain and Germany.  The ivory toothy robot twirls around and about like a better sounding R2D2.

Then we are, in a blink, watching another sightless actor, this one human.  He has his seeing-eye dog as he tunes his prey a concert grand. We watch him bend the sounds back into the clarity we simultaneously hear.  We are treated to the reactions of his dog along the way.  We are reminded of Bach's own agon with tuning and tempering as truly part of composing.  Nice Job, this.

The music takes us to the super highway, an echo of the piano roll.  Here it is the holes in the paper animated by cars in lanes.  Our Catalan truck driver and his partner provide the layering over the drive.  His mighty engine sports murals of the Virgin at a thousand Euro a pop.  She is a double throwback to the tarty gals that were painted on American bombers some sixty years past.  Her load is benign this time.  His little partner breaks into a fugue on his mouth organ, foreshadowing what we will next hear.  In the hotel, our driver plays bassoon, dear Bruno.

So it is time time to tell you about Pere Portabella, as I reveal my title joke.  He worked for Luis Bunuel, that cinematic Dali.  Knowing this, you know why plot would be damaging to this sort of film.  We need to have intermezzi;  serveing to not only clean the palate, but situate to the next scene.  So we have showering, buttering toast, grooming and other interstitial moments that I find suitable in their own right.  You cannot jam everything without losing everything.  You cannot go from a showroom packed with playing of pianos smack into dressage without killing both the horse and all those Steinways (and other makes).

Then we plunge into the time of Bach in Thomaskirche in Leipzig.  I was there for his anniversary, and a concert on this organ.  This actor pulls no fewer than sixteen stops and causes a performance that stands on your chest like an elephant, slowly rocking.  Bach demonstrates his use of the Neapolitan technique of crossing hands on the keyboard as he shows off his inventions for the patron's emissary.  We see Christoph Friedrich annoying his nubile sister.  But then we watch him, so young, amble through one of the Well Tempered Clavier Preludes.  Perfect in paternity, Bach takes him in hand to appreciate the tension created by harmonic progression.  That moment alone is reason to watch this film.

Now a market.  The best ever created for this period.  We know Bach is gone because we have potato, unknown to him.  We have instead a clown of a butcher.  He tries to rise to the level of this grand market, but looks more like the creep at the used car lot.  Portabella queues you in by making that fleicher offer to deliver to Mendelssohn a whole pig.  Perfect for anticipating the wrapping of bloody chunks with the paper music sheets of the Saint Matthew.  One resounding scene is of massed cellos filling a single subway car.

Portabella goes on to explore the role of music in the holocaust and the perverse firebombing of Dresden.  Portaballa takes the time to remember Simon Laks, who played piano for silent films, then was trapped in several camps to somehow live and write again.  Portabella favors the long shot, the master shot, instead of climbing into the close-ups of nose pores. Thereby he shows expanse of road, river and music.  We have that great river, the Elbe, transversing time, back and forth in past and present scenes in a riverboat named for the terminus, Bad Schandau.

Cheers to Romania in the Nobel, and this film quotes another Romanian, Emil Cioran ""Bach is the only thing that reminds us the world is not a failure.""  The Magnificat makes a perfect end to such devotion and to the vitality of music.  That and a reprise of the piano roll, this time showing the increasing complexity of the perforations of perfection.",1255219200,4,4415,4.635658914728682
8321898,3,B001MUOSJ6,"As a life longe lover of the music of Bach, I was eager to see this film.  Perhaps if I had expected less I would have been less critical...but I'll share my honest reaction.  It's sort of a documentary and yet has some promise of a plot with real characters but the mishmash of styles left me more annoyed than entertained or enlightened.  The good part is that we get a lot of music, on cellos, pianos, a harpsichord, a bassoon, a harmonica and best of all, in my opinion, from a wonderful male chorus.

What is most tedious is the filler material in between the selections.  We are forced to watch numerous scenes of people doing mundane tasks, washing their faces, spreading butter on toast, walking down stairs, etc. all in close-up, very slowly, as if what they are doing has something to add to the meaning of the film.  If it did, it escaped me.  We see an old man washing his face, combing his hair, arranging the toilet articles in place, dress himself layer by painstaking layer, walk up the street, board a bus, enter a cafe, make small talk with the barista, order hot chocolate, drink the chocolate, and then give his talk as a mock Bach to a group of tourists.  Some may find this charming; apparently the film maker did, but I found it just really really boring.

He does show a beautiful young woman take a shower, dry herself and blow dry her hair and this may perk up the male viewers.  She plays the cello, too, although very briefly.  At times I thought a plot might develop as she is headed for Leipzig for a concert and then a hunky truck driver is hired to ship a piano also to Leipzig. I wondered if they would meet...maybe play a duet. (He plays the bassoon when he's not on the road.)  No such luck.

We see quite a bit of the church where Bach once worked and the cello player shows up there to visit and then the receptionist lies down on the sofa and falls asleep.  We sympathize.  We see a view of the dining room where the students eat and then the film is over.

If you love Bach, my suggestion is to skip this film and buy another CD.
I think he would have hated it.",1239494400,6,2100,4.265151515151516
