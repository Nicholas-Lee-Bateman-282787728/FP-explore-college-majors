8562010,5,B00B361HZW,"This WrestleMania is from 1989 and originates at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.  The headline match is between Hulk Hogan and The Macho Man Randy Savage with Miss Elizabeth in a ""neutral"" corner.  Also on the program are most of the stars (and managers) from this time period with Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura handling the announcing chores.  (A bit bittersweet, as it's good to see the performers who helped make the WWF so popular, once more, and also sad to realize how many of the same performers are now dead.)  Three hours with three title matches and all that you would expect from a WrestleMania program.  I give it five stars because if I were to lose my copy---I would definitely want to replace it.",1450396800,,717,4.6141732283464565

8562017,3,B00B361HZW,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

This marked the first time ever that a WrestleMania was held in the same venue back to back as it returned to Trump Plaza in Atlantic City once again as  Run-DMC performed their ""WrestleMania Rap"" while this was the WrestleMania debuts of superstars & legends like Big Boss Man, Mr. Perfect, Owen Hart as the Blue Blazer, Ronnie Garvin, Tully Blanchard & Arn Anderson, Marty Jannetty & Shawn Michaels.

""The Mega Powers"" explode was the name given to the event based off the main event a year in the making as the former partners now enemies faced off in WWE Champion Randy Savage vs. Hulk Hogan with their manager Ms. Elizabeth in a neutral corner but was a distraction to both men throughout the contest as this was one of the most competitive & aggressive matches in both men's careers.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude, Tag Team Champions Demolition vs. Powers Of Pain & Mr. Fuji, Jake Roberts vs. Andre The Giant with Big John Studd as the special referee, Jim Duggan vs. Bad News Brown, Rockers vs. Twin Towers, Brutus Beekcake vs. Ted Dibiase, Mr. Perfect vs. Blue Blazer, Dino Bravo vs. Ronnie Garvin, Brain Busters vs. Strike Force, Hart Foundation vs. Honky Tonk Man & Greg Valentine, Hercules vs. King Haku, Bushwackers vs. Fabulous Rougeaus, Red Rooster vs. Bobby Heenan, and the return of Roddy Piper in ""Piper's Pit"" with Brother Love & Morton Downey Jr. but this segment was edited.

This was pretty much a ""one match"" card with the main event being the highlight as most of the other main attractions on the card were either just backdrop to further or quickly finish a storyline while the rest of the undercard was solid but easily forgettable by the end of the night.  In the end, I would only recommend this Mania for those who want to add to their collection or just a fan during this period of time.",1364515200,2,2177,4.65625
