3920853,2,B002F6MPZK,"I was looking for a TV series on Netflix to watch with my 2 year old son. Handy Manny was one of the options. I figured it was similar to a Dora the Explorer type setup. It couldn't be any less like that if it tried.

The series focuses on Manny, a repairman with talking tools who helps out people in his town. There are some Spanish words used in each episode, but they are usually not repeated and quickly glossed over. Some times they don't even give the English equivalent! I've watched this particular 2 part episode along with several others.

If you are looking for a safe family show to set your young kids down in front of, this might do the trick. However, don't expect them to learn much in the way of Spanish or much else. The only positive take away message this show delivers is to help others when you can.",1385078400,,822,4.262820512820513
3920854,5,B002F6MPZK,"Handy Manny has become one of my favorites! The stories are engaging, the tools and Mr. Lopart are funny, and there are many lessons to be learned. This particular episode is no exception. As a nanny, I have introduced 4 children to Manny, ages 3-5 and they all pay close attention and laugh and laugh! And FYI, they are all girls!! At a time when they are inundated with princesses, Manny provides a welcome break for all, and they are picking up some Spanish phrases and vocab at the same time!",1374278400,,496,4.461538461538462
