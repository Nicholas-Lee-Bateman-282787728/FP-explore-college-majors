5013429,5,B006QDAEEM,Some of Tina's best concerts were held in Europe. This is just one of them and worth having as a representative sample. I wish she had one in Blu-ray but it is still enjoyable with the upscaling.,1373587200,,195,4.297297297297297
5013430,5,B006QDAEEM,I have always liked Ms. Tina Turner but I couldn't afford her live concerts until a friend said to check out Amazon and so here I am enjoying her music and I will be ordering other live concert music that I could not other wise have afforded to purchase... go AMAZON!!!!,1371168000,,270,4.313725490196078

5013432,5,B006QDAEEM,Amazing for a 72 (69 at the time) year old woman. I did not have that amount of energy at 40.,1362873600,,93,3.4761904761904763
5013433,4,B006QDAEEM,"I love the queen of rock and roll. However, the copy that I received the words were in Spanish, although I did order an English copy.",1362441600,,133,4.153846153846154
5013434,1,B006QDAEEM,"Product arrived with hard sub titles which I was unable to view without.
The concert is an excellent concert but the dvd that it arrived on was amature.",1356307200,5,152,4.464285714285714
5013435,3,B006QDAEEM,Like waching Tina Turner concert on VHS tape. It looks like is copied from a tape and picture is not sharp at all.,1355702400,4,114,4.0
5013436,5,B006QDAEEM,Great little number.  I use it every day while exercising on the treadmill.  A wonderful investment for exercise or whatever...,1354665600,,127,5.3
5013437,5,B006QDAEEM,"Great concert, great DVD! Tina is so amazing for an entertainer that has been performing fof so long , has not lost anything, love her!",1354492800,,135,4.44
5013438,5,B006QDAEEM,"Tina's voice is great, the set list just killer, the dancers are WAY too sexy, and the band and backup singers are absolutely first rate. It's a historical review, if you will, or her body of work across the years. She sings like she's a lot younger than her years, and the band is tight regardless of the tune.

I don't think there's a bad cut on here to be honest. It's just hit after hit after hit.........Maybe too polished if your taste doesn't lean this direction, but if you like Tina and her hybrid of rock and soul. you're gonna love it.",1344988800,11,546,4.300970873786408
8502995,5,B006QDAEEM,If you don't have this you should - best live concert ever,1437523200,,58,3.9166666666666665

8502997,1,B006QDAEEM,Picture quality is weak..All lyrics are stuck in close caption and all in Spanish..The sound does not match the movement of the lips on screen.. Would have much preferred a blu ray...,1412985600,,183,4.75
8502998,5,B006QDAEEM,wonderful,1408838400,,9,9.0
8502999,5,B006QDAEEM,"Really wanted this but a new one was $43.  Bought this used and it plays like new.  I was watching this on youtube, but now I watch it on big screen.  Yeehaw!",1402876800,,158,3.875
8503000,5,B006QDAEEM,"Some reviewers are saying that the music DVD illustrated here (with the title ""Tina Turner Live in Holland 2009"") is a bootleg copy from her earlier Tina Live tour. That was not my experience at all. The DVD I bought from Movie Mars, Inc. is in HD, and has very high production values. It's a recording of the concert Tina performed at the GelreDome in Arnhem, Holland on Mar 21, 2009. As for the concert itself, I'm a long-time Tina Turner fan, and just loved it. One special treat is the dancing of Ferly Prado, the blonde dancer who is usually at the right end of the line of 4 dancers.",1382572800,,589,4.315315315315315
8503001,1,B006QDAEEM,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tina-Live-CD-DVD/dp/B002M2K89W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tina Live [CD/DVD</a>] O.K. Folks here is the deal. This DVD is a bootleg televised edition of TINA LIVE it has been cut down from its 2 hours and 11 minutes to only 45 minutes. And some versions will have subtitles that can not be turned of from being taken off of European television. You can purchase this same concert the original version Tina Live as a CD/DVD COMBO with 15 songs on the CD and 20 songs on the DVD Filmed in HD at the GelreDome, Arnhem, Holland on 21st March 2009. The real release and not the fake phoney CD-R made from cut down broadcast. It is sad that so many bootleg fakes of the real shows seem to be being sold more and more at Amazon than the real deal. And it is sad people have to trick or deceive you into buying a fake. So shoppers beware and do your homework before buying. When I saw this listing I thought it was a new DVD concert I did not have. Upon further investigating work you now know what I have uncovered here. As always just trying to inform and help buyers like all my reviews have done on Amazon through the years.",1378684800,22,1190,4.698564593301436
8503002,5,B006QDAEEM,"I have watched and listened to Tina since she was with Ike. She is a true talent and continues to be so even in retirement.  Her moves on stage, her audience appeal is down to earth, not fake like many artists.  The actions she has between her girls and musicians, amazing!.

The songs performed are absolutely powerful and moving. If you are a Tina fan, this DVD delivers some powerful music, and if you have a surround sound audio system, order a pizza, grab your popcorn, sit back and be ready for some heart thumpin' foot tapping music!",1377475200,2,540,4.489795918367347
8503003,1,B006QDAEEM,This is a rip off. The video looks like a bootleg copy. The sound is of good quality. It has subtitles and could have been made off of another copy.,1376438400,4,148,3.966666666666667
8503004,2,B006QDAEEM,"I bought this DVD ASSUMING it was totally in English. Although the audio is in English, all of the language(typed words) in the menu are in Spanish.",1376092800,2,148,4.518518518518518
