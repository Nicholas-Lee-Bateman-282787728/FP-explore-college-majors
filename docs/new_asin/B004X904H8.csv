8446540,3,B004X904H8,Watched this a few times-This is Ellroy and his dog hamming it up-Funny and fun thrill trails off after awhile.,1471478400,,111,4.6
8446541,2,B004X904H8,"No one on the planet is a bigger James Ellroy fan, but this series is a disappointment.  First off, there is too much Ellroy - a statement that I never thought that I would say, but he just gets in the way of the material all of the time.  And I won't even mention the @#$%^&* dog!  And the source material should be great, but becomes secondary to the ego trip Ellroy is on.  It starts out amusing but soon become annoying.  Sorry James, but you have a personality that comes across better in the written word.",1436400000,,511,4.22680412371134

8446543,5,B004X904H8,"You have to love James Ellroy to appreciate this set of DVDs - both my husband and I do. I really enjoyed watching the stories he covers in each episode. Plus, the set includes episodes that never aired on TV. The sidekick dog is annoying at times but Ellroy is terrific.",1392249600,,271,4.333333333333333
8446544,4,B004X904H8,"James Ellroy is quite a character, his personality might turn some viewers off from the beginning, but if you can get through that and pay attention to the stories he tells, I find them all pretty entertaining. He jumps from one story to the next rather quickly but it is not too much to handle. A good purchase for anyone interested in the ""lesser known"" tales of LA's seedy history.",1382313600,,384,4.5
8446545,5,B004X904H8,"James Ellroy, author of LA Confidential and Blood's a Rover, brings to life some of LA's most infamous crimes and criminals. I enjoyed it not only because I've became a fan of his, but also because I, like him, am very fastinated by crime and criminals. LA is most known as the home of Hollywood and the city of movie stars, but this series revels a darker, more sinister side to the city of angels.",1355616000,,399,4.333333333333333
