The songs are original and contemporary and stand up to repeated listening.  It's shot like a real kids rock concert and moms and dads will walk away humming the tunes after one screening.

2346473,5,B000A0GYKK,"As a preschool teacher, I could not be happier with The Shushybye Dream Band Live on Tour, which is the only DVD that my students ever want to listen to!  They even created their own Shushybye train dance, which gets them up and active.  It is now part of our daily routine to sing Shushybye songs.

8071460,5,B000A0GYKK,"When I first put this DVD on for my 16 month old, I expected him to listen to parts of the songs, if that. I really didn't expect him to be mesmerized for the full DVD from the moment Michael North begins singing the Shushybye Theme Song! Conductor McCloud is the host of the tour and engages the children in the audience with the help of the Shushies: Snoozles, Dozie, and Zeez. My son claps, dances, and points to the Shushies as the show progresses. It's also really nice to see the faces of the actual band members who play this wonderfully entertaining music. I can honestly say, my husband and I love the music as much as our toddler. I'm very happy we own this DVD and I know our son will enjoy watching it for years to come.",1376524800,,732,4.235714285714286
