1231088,4,B00000IYRB,"I love documentaries, especially about horror film. In Search of Dracula is more about the real Dracula, but also has a really good dose of movie history as well. It has a fairly long run time and some really amazing footage of the locals in Romania and their beliefs. Its a bit dry, but its a documentary...so I didn't mind at all. Very well worth the money!",1311638400,2,359,4.373134328358209
1231089,4,B00000IYRB,"I do enjoy the occasional documentary.  The documentaries from the 70s are especially fun with their biases and rehearsed scenes.

Earlier I had posted a Dracula documentary with Vincent Price as host.  It was hokey and fun at the same time and did not pretend to be too serious.  That film had some genuine Dracula lore and actual footage of the peoples of the Carpathian mountain region.  Superstitions were explained and a few movie clips were show.

Christopher Lee hosted his version, shot at about the same time as Price's.  Lee had the role of narrator but also got a few of his own personal clips in there as well, praising his own Hammer film, Horror of Dracula.

That's fine, he is the epitome of Drac after all.  There was new footage of Lee dressed as the original Prince Dracul, aka Vlad the Impaler.  About half the documentary concentrated on this guy, some praising him as a hero but others as a butcher.  Lee told stories of impalings of noblemen - an especially gruesome scene of nails being driven into the heads of those who refused to take off their turbans while at The Presence!

A guy who claims to be a vampire and drinking his own blood from a cup was dull and could have been left out.  The scenes were clearly rehearsed.

There was a piece about Frankenstein too and how there was some relation between the actual Frankenstein family and Vlad the Impaler, but that was quite a stretch.  I was disappointed in the bad research in showing the lightning and electric machinery while Christopher Lee read from Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.  There was no electric machinery in the original book - that was the Karloff film's addition.  Oops!

A vampire bat was shown as he lapped up the blood of his guinea pig victim was an interesting piece of animal behavior.  Dang those bats are ugly!

Overall, a decent documentary.  Not much there that was not already explained in the Price film.  Recommended.

1231090,5,B00000IYRB,"""In Search of Dracula"" is based on one of the most important books on vampires ever written. The groundbreaking, ""In Search of Dracula"" released in 1973, was one of the most talked about books that year and set into motion the parallels that still exist with the vampire created by Bram Stoker and his REAL LIFE sixteenth century counterpart, Vlad Tepes.
The international success of the book meant a movie was not far behind and director Calvin Floyd was up to the task.

Originally, the film was supposed to be a drive-in feature but due to poor publicity and the con-currency of the ""In Search Of"" television show with Leonard Nimoy, the film died at the box-office, along with any hopes of creating a series out of this. A Frankenstein follow-up was planned but was subsequently changed towards a more direct adaption of the Mary Shelly original story, which would prove to be the most faithful adaption in 1976 under the title, ""Terror of Frankenstein"".

""In Search of Dracula"" was relatively unseen for many years before being released to DVD uncut and in it's original glory.

The documentary may seem quaint now but carries with it a sense of dread and creepiness that only films of this vintage can truly pull off. Hosted by the great Christopher Lee, himself one of the great Draculas and whom many of his own film clips are utilized for this documentary. Lee goes through the plot of the Stoker novel and through the legends of vampires in ancient and popular culture. The film details several historical events of ""real"" vampires often with creepy and odd re-enactments and of course, details the history of Vlad the Impaler.

The film also veers off for a time into the universe of the Frankenstein legend and how it was birthed on that faithful Summer of 1816 and how it's story is important to the Dracula one. A history of the films are also provided including several rare photographs of Bela Lugosi, footage from ""Nosferatu(1922)"" and a few other vampire films as well.

It's really not a great documentary but it is unique. The five star rating allotted it is due to one's personal taste for these strange, vintage documentaries. For those with a morbid and strange sense of mind this documentary will most likely suffice and it would be reccomended that one should hunt down the television episode of the same name as well as the VHS, ""Dracula:The Great Undead"" with Vincent Price for similiar entertainment.

All others be warned that this documentary is strange and slow-moving. Dated and bizarre.
If these words describe you than carry on and purchase this and wait for a dark night and enjoy with a couple of  fellow weirdos in the comfort of you're own castle.",1252627200,8,2685,4.773706896551724
1231091,2,B00000IYRB,"I went into this film knowing it was a quasi-documentary, and that didn't bother me. I always got a kick out of 70s-era supernatural pseudo-documentaries like ""In Search Of ..."" and I am a sucker for those UFO and ghost story ""documentaries"" that frequently pop up on The Discovery Channel. I also have a huge soft spot for Christopher Lee. ""In Search of Dracula""'s problem isn't its premise. Its peoblem is its cheap and poorly done execution. The film is muddy and poorly lit. It moves at a snail's pace. It is padded with three long segments of public domain silent films. And the film print is in poor condition, so the movie looks awful. The only thing to recommend the movie at all is Christopher Lee, who is always a class act and a pleasure to watch and listen to. A curiosity at best.",1225324800,,793,4.475862068965517
1231092,3,B00000IYRB,"Among the many, and often duplicative, Dracula documentaries, this was probably the first and among the best. Although it is a bit dated now, it offers higher production values and more drama than most of the others, not to mention narration by Christopher Lee, who gets to play both Dracula and his historic inspriation, Vlad the Impaler. The DVD adds a number of scenes that were deleted when this film was aired by PBS some decades ago. Most of these, however, seem peripheral to the central theme and are somewhat repulsive, dealing mostly with disturbed individuals who imagine themselves to be vampires and who drink either their own blood or that of others. On the other hand, for some mind-boggling reason, other bits that were shown on national television have been cut from this print, including a brief bit of nudity. The DVD production team seems to have been far more sensitive about that than the antics of the blood-drinking individuals who are included. Still, a good overview of the Vlad/Dracula history",1116979200,7,1020,4.936046511627907
1231093,3,B00000IYRB,"The fascination for vampires and the mythical character of Dracula has  resulted in many cinematic outings over the last century. Ever since the  creation of Bram Stoker's original novel, DRACULA, published in 1897,  audiences have loved the experience of being frightened by this diabolical  figure. Not many know however that Bram Stoker based his vampire lord on a  historical figure: Vlad ""Tepes"" (pronounced Tseppesh) Drakula who lived in  15th Century Romania. Born in Sighisoara in 1431, he grew up in a very  hostile environment. His father Vlad II had become a member of the Order of  the Dragon, an equivalent to Knighthood, which was to serve the population  and protect them from their enemies, the Turks. The title of Dragon, Drakul  in Romanian, was hereditary; hence Drakula, meaning Son of the Dragon. When  Vlad II was Prince of the Province of Wallachia, the Turkish Sultan invited  him to his court for the purpose of peace talks. However, once there Vlad  and his son found themselves trapped and ambushed. Vlad II saw his son  being taken hostage while he himself would become a virtual pon to the  Sultan's whims. After a number of years of torturous imprisonment, Vlad  Drakula managed to escape. Subsequent to his father, he crowned himself  Prince of Wallachia and began crusading cruelly against the Turks. His  favorite method of torturing and killing them was to impale them on large  wooden poles and watch them writhe in agony until they died. Hence the  nickname ""Tepes"" which means Impaler. Drakula headed many campaigns against  the Turks and in 1476 he fell in battle during one of these campaigns. His  head was taken to the Sultan in Constantinopel as a trophy while his body  was buried by monks on the isle of Snagov. Strangely enough, when the  monastery on Snagov was excavated in 1931, the body of Vlad Tepes was never  found, which of course lent more credibility to the vampire legend. The  documentary In Search Of Dracula is based on the book of the same name by  Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu. They researched the subject carefully  and published their findings in the early 1970s, at a time where the  interest in the mythical figure was fairly high. (Several Hammer films with  Christopher Lee were still fresh in the audience's memories and more were  soon to come, including a Broadway revival starring Frank Langella.) Soon  after the book hit the stands, this documentary was produced. Being a  product of it's time, it now seems, of course, hopelessly dated. Yet it has  retained a certain seventies'charm of being one of those documentaries you  will no doubt remember having seen before in a dark and nearly forgotten  past. Subjectwise the film does not quite succeed as it takes too long in  getting to the point. It also takes too much time in explaining the vampire  mythology and even strays in areas wholly inappropriate for this subject  matter. (The Frankenstein Phenomenon being an interesting yet totally non  sequitur sidebar.) The way it deals with the historical figure one would  have expected a more in depth study. As the matter stands, Vlad Tepes gets  a superficial working over at best. The film quality is average but some  mediocre source material is used and although the sound quality is also  average, the sound itself it undistinguished mono. It may have been quite a  coup for an independent production as this to have landed Christopher Lee  as it's narrator, host and main performer (he plays both the historical  Dracula as well as the film character in a mockumentary approach), but his  monotonous narration does not lend this production more than curiosa value.  IN SEARCH OF DRACULA may be a pleasant surprise for vampire buffs and  Dracula fans (since this film is definitely a must in a good Dracula  collection) the average viewer should be aware that this production has  nothing more than curiosa value due to the heavily dated approach to  documentary filmmaking.",961200000,18,3964,4.936267071320182
