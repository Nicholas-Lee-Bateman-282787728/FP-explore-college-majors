8311325,2,B001IQDAOS,"once again useless skeptics ruin it, talk about a group of losers. only gave it 2 stars because stories were good, but the skeptic crap completely killed it. They should have never been interviewed for this. Some people just don't wanna believe in anything they can't understand or explain, it's like why do they even get out of bed in the morning? They just bring everyone else down with their negativity. Skeptics are a waste! Science can't explain everything otherwise there would be a cure for most diseases, but scientists would rather waste time and money trying to explain things that have no rational explanation.",1511136000,,621,4.923809523809524

8311327,1,B001IQDAOS,"Don't buy this video; I bought it for my son.  It is incredibly boring and has no ghost activity.  It actually is just an episode of ""the unexplained"" a series that came on a few years back.  They never actually discusses any hauntings or ghost activity.  As I stated, it is one of the most uninteresting, boring videos I have ever bought.  Don't waste your money.",1273622400,13,364,4.454545454545454
8311328,5,B001IQDAOS,"An unbelieveable piece of work.  Two amazing stories to start the film and the ending will send chills throughout your body.  A masterpiece put together with wonderful words and pictures to compliment each other.  Sitting alone, even in the light of day...you'll wonder who's around!",963532800,10,283,5.2444444444444445
