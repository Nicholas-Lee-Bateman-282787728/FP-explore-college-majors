It was a glimps of a time in which I did attend many similar events but perhaps without the access that these film makers had.  Enjoyed the film and music.  Didn't include the negative elements that were in the press about some of these musicians.",1265241600,2,313,4.456140350877193

8366578,1,B002E01M88,The new disk (disk 2) Outtake Performances has only lossy Dolby Digital 2.0 192kbps sound. Inexcusable for the Blu-ray format. Note that even MP3 can offer more kbps than this. Playing time of the disk is about 2 hours.,1518048000,,219,4.641025641025641

8366580,5,B002E01M88,"I own the original Blu-ray release of this film. I read about this remaster and decided to upgrade.  It was worth the price of upgrade.

I compared several scenes, especially the more problematic night scenes with Otis Redding.  The newer version is noticeably sharper with better dynamic range.  Black levels are also better.

The audio is taken from the same source as the earlier version and is excellent, especially for a film this old.

 The film is a wonderful capture of the festival.  If you want to understand '60's music, you need three films:  The T.A.M.I. Show, Monterey Pop and Woodstock.  Monterey Pop is the most idealistic.",1515110400,2,639,4.88785046728972
8366581,5,B002E01M88,"Monterey Pop,"" directed by D.A. Pennebaker (Bob Dylan: Dont Look Back), was a rock music festival that took place on a June weekend in California in1967, at the beginning of the Summer of Love. Musicians included The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Country Joe and the Fish (the San Francisco sound); Buffalo Springfield, Johnny Rivers, and Canned Heat (L.A.); Simon & Garfunkel (New York); Otis Redding and Booker T and the MGs (soul); and Hugh Masekala and Ravi Shankar (world music).

Highlights of the movie include Janis Joplins rendition of Ball n Chain, The Who destroying their instruments at the end of My Generation, and Jimi Hendrix setting his guitar of fire. The camera captures the enthusiasm and often surprise of audience members during the various sets. Setting the style for Woodstock, which would take place a few years later, Monterey Pop featured acts that would dominate the late 60s and early 70s.

The festival was organized by John Phillips of The Mamas and the Papas and record producer Lou Adler. The idea was to create for rock music what the Monterey Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk Festival did for their genres. Pennebakers seven cameramen often zoom in very tightly on the artists. The result is that animated performers like Joplin bob in an out of the frame. The editing captures the excitement and energy of both artists and audience.

Bonus materials on the 2-Disc Blu-ray release includes two hours of performances not included in the theatrical release, from the Association, Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Blues Project, Buffalo Springfield, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the Byrds, Country Joe and the Fish, the Electric Flag, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Al Kooger, the Mamas and the Papas, the Steve Miller Blues Band, Moby Grape, Laura Nyro, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Simon and Garfunkel, Tiny Tim, and the Who.

Also included: audio commentary from 2002 featuring Pennebaker and festival producer Lou Adler; new and archival interviews with Adler and Pennebaker; Chiefs (1968), a short film by Richard Leacock, which played alongside Monterey Pop in theaters; audio interviews with festival producer John Phillips and performers Cast Elliott and David Crosby; photo essay; festival program; and trailers and radio spots.",1513123200,,2302,5.230352303523035
