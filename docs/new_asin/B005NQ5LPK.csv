4849492,4,B005NQ5LPK,"If you are down on lowbrow anime pervert humor / ecchi comdey, regardless if there is some real cleverness & humor in it, then just walk away. This being another fantasy ecchi harem comedy, it has all of that & then some.

But this show really had me laughing. And there is an intersting mystery going on with some darker ominous undertones, creating some legitimate tension making you want to see the next episode. The angeloid characters are all well done characters with distinct different personalities & motivations. Our mian protaganist who ends up having to look after the angeloids, is an idiot. But one of the better idiots I have seen in these kinds of comedys, and well done character. It could be easy to dismiss a show like this as more fan service cheeasiness, but I think it does have some genuinely funny stuff going on throughout most of the show. The end credit animation & songs being different for each episode (and quite funny & clever) add a nice touch.",1319673600,85,975,4.635838150289017

  This is a very good and funny anime for sure!

4849494,5,B005NQ5LPK,"OK, so to start this off the name of the manga that this is based on and also the name of the japanese version is ""Sora no Otoshimono"". The main characteristic of the manga, as can be seen from the cover itself, is fan service, i mean there's a whole episode centering around panties. But don't let that deter you if you're not into that stuff. The manga is riddled with many hilarious scenes, and is a guaranteed good time. It also manages to incorporate a couple of touching and emotional episodes. Overall i give this manga a 5/5 and recommend it to everyone i know. I hope that the english release of this anime will live up to the expectations the manga itself has set for me.",1318723200,14,681,4.328125

4849519,5,B005NQ5LPK,"I do have to admit that the fan service at the start is what caught my eye as this was (actually season 2) shown as a trailer in another anime series I got from Amazon.  After watching it not only is there top notch fan service but I have to say I deeply love these characters. I can only imagine the voice actors of this series having a blast doing this series by that I mean the American as well as the Japanese Actors.

Our main character Tomoki is a world class pervert and he does always get punished in unique ways for his constant perverted ways. Deep down he is a good guy as long as a nice bust line is not in view.  I find myself laughing because it reminds me of adolescence only cranked up to 11 out of a possible 5!

Underneath all of the fan service you will see there is a story line and the series has its serious moments through out. I find it unique as Tomoki the guy that is on the bottom of the totem pole makes such a impact of the angeloids by his kindness and him just being himself.  It is a vast difference from (as example) Nymph's previous master who only ran her down and tortured her for his amusement.

In the end it is the character of Ikaros that draws me to this series.  LOL I really was rooting for her with in every episode and I got to say she is the dream woman in the end.  She has a innocence that is refreshing and I love the way she cares for a watermelon :-)  She doesn't know what love(she was built without the understanding) is but she never the less finds more and more love through this series and yes the second as well (I've only seen the 2 seasons at this point).  Not only is she sweet as a button but she can kick butt when needed.  Her dependability is remarkable and even though she calls Tomoki ""master"" I feel it is really her love that keeps her linked to him and not the ""imprinting"" that was formed i.e. the chain. Watching her try more and more to fit in to be human shows her dedication and love for Tomoki.

She wants only to please Tomoki and Tomoki himself wants her to be happy.

All the characters on here are top notch and there really is a light heartiness to this series.  Maybe I am being bias because I do enjoy this series but if you enjoy anime and love fan service with dashes of drama with comedy as the icing on top, than this series is for you.",1487980800,2,2322,4.0747252747252745

Only to experience that this wish almost permanently came true. Tune in to find out how this boy's perverted adventures progress, as well as where they may take him.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Overall, it's a nice and relaxing anime to watch and have some laughs. Some of the more serious situations might make one question about how one treat things that look human but are not or maybe instill some feeling into the viewer, at the very least. For the most part, this anime is light-hearted, but has its serious moments that may leave you in suspense.

Great amounts of fan-service. Unfortunately there is censorship. But not in annoying ways like that random blinding light.
Still, this anime has pretty funny scenes, lots of waifus, and gets a bit more serious as the anime progresses which they foreshadow as well.

- Analysis: An overlooked but all-too-common concept that is addressed is that many humans are simplistic. Especially men. As many of them tend to be perverted. Moreover, most people do not think too deeply about the future, but are fairly content with their daily lives as long as they feel they have become molded into the conformity of society.

For example, many people may live their lives paycheck-to-paycheck, and although they may be dissatisfied with a lack of advancement, they probably are content that there is a job that can be done by them. Couple that with things such as procrastination, and people tend to become complacent or robotic. They may say common greetings such as ""good morning"" and ""thank you"" out of habit even when the situation does not quite match up.

Another interesting concept that is brought up is that although some of the females look human, they are not. However, that doesn't stop the kind-hearted characters from treating them any differently than other humans. Logically and emotionally, this poses some thought-provoking materials for the viewer. In a way, this reminds me of how many people may regard their pets as friends or part of their family. We know that pets such as dogs aren't biologically related to us, but that sort of thing doesn't seem to matter to many people. Likewise in this anime, the protagonist isn't really bothered that the females aren't human.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 14 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 14 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5.5 hours. There are 5 discs in total, but one is labeled Extra and contains textless opening and closing songs and trailers. Rated TV-MA for sexual content (fan-service). There is censorship, so there isn't any nudity.

4849546,5,B005NQ5LPK,"Heaven's Lost Property Season 1 is not for the average person, or even someone who wants to be average. It's a sweet science-fiction, harem, ecchi anime. It's the story of Tomoki, a lonely young man who thinks hentai and seeing girls underclothes (voyeurism) is the meaning of life. He lucks into finding an Angeloid (Angel + Android), Ikaros, that is emotionally stunted but really does care. I won't give too much of the story, but the heart of it is Tomoki's fight to have a 'normal' life of quiet and peace (excluding the screams of the girls he wants to see half-full naked.) Between his neighbor/childhood friend, Angeloids and friends at the School ""New World Discovery' club, he has his hands full.

Note - there is some weirdness, scenes almost like 'Wine of the Dreamers' by John D. MacDonald (recommended reading) - some reality/unreality to the story that they seem to just bring up, then drop. Sometimes it's like 2 stories are going on at once, only one is focused on.",1468195200,3,982,4.742690058479532

4849564,5,B005NQ5LPK,"This anime... Oh gawd this anime. Now I respect those who aren't into harrem anime on the account that they all seem to follow the same plot lines. I understand not liking echi stuff for similar reasons and for the fact people to want to see boobs in yo face. But this anime is not normal for even the two big genres it falls in no this anime breaks the rules punches you in the face and pulls you into the car and gives you a ride of your life. This show is hilarious and I enjoy the whole thing.

So the general idea of the show is some 16 year old pervert lives in a small quit town and simply wants to be left alone in his peaceful life. Then some half naked girl with wings falls from the sky and starts granting his every wish... Now I should mention that the lead in this show gets what's coming to hum , he doesn't get away with his perverted life style. Every character is likeable and generally quite memorable like that fish guy and the old quiet librarian lady and the guy who tricked the whole town to hunt each other down with guns in the woods for money.

4849569,5,B005NQ5LPK,"Of all the anime I have watched, I have to say this one really took me by surprise. Given that I thought this was just another Ecchi/Harem, which I do enjoy...,what got me about this series was the story progression. The story of Tomaki, a high school student who just wants piece and quiet, and Ikaros, the autonomous Angeloid who crashes into Earth and Tomaki's life. What started out as a strictly perverted, child like, silly anime about a ""Pet Class"" Angeloid who can fulfill any wish (you can just see where the minds wander after taking one look at Ikaros) begins to turn a little more dark and sinister. Also, there are parts in this series that really do tug on the heart just a bit, as you watch the relationship between Tomakai and Ikaros. Her inability , due to programming, to express feelings and her struggle to understand the nature of the human heart forces even the most callous of viewers to empathize with her. And as Tomaki slowly starts to develop a different outlook towards Ikaros, as not just an object, but a person his heart begins to change as well. Then there is Nymph, another Angeloid who ends up interrupting Tomaki's world. Crass, indifferent, rude, and just down right condescending, she refers to humans as ""Bug"". Sent to retrieve Ikaros, she finds herself slowly start to realize that Tomaki's perverted nature hides a truly gentle soul. Finally the other girl in his life, childhood friend and next door neighbor Eishiro,  has a hard time expressing her love for Tomaki, and can only do so by beating the hell out of him for every little thing. Fun, humorous, a little trashy, childish, and heart felt.... Heaven's Lost Property is a story that just made me feel good.......",1454544000,11,1711,4.703333333333333

I'm not going to bore you with technical details, especially because I'm not really qualified to give them. It looks good, it sounds good. That's about what you need to know. The audio track might be a bit less audible at low volumes than I'd like, but it's not a deal breaker.
This is a show with a fair amount of humor, but it does get DARK in some places. It doesn't linger on the issues too much, however, and seems to quickly revert back to the raunchy brand of comedy for which this genre is famous.
While you're not going to find anything tremendously unique here, if you're a fan of this type of anime, I'd recommend this.",1451520000,,689,4.3076923076923075

Sad times
Depressing times
Pervy times

What more can you really ask for.

In all seriousness tho this really is a good anime iv been a fan of it for years and was very disappointed to hear there would be no season 3. This is one of the few anime's I get enjoyment out of rewatching.

At $20 for blu-ray and DVD its a win win. This is the first anime in my new collection and I was faced with a tough choice, either go DVD or Blu-ray. If I went blu-ray I get an excellent picture a dynamic sound and just a better viewing experience. However its not widely used.

On the other hand EVERYONE has a DVD player between built in the TV, a game console, or a PC any one can watch DVD which is nice since I can share my anime with my friends.

I chose both at a great price can't go wrong with that",1423872000,5,1066,3.957943925233645

4849646,4,B005NQ5LPK,"A fun crazy kinda show. If you couldn't tell from the cover there is fanservice, and among all the boobs and jokes there is a plot. Oddly enough this is one of the few shows where I could care less about the plot. Every time the plot shows up it's just something that makes you feel bad for the characters. I would rather watch the comedic romance than the dark subplot.

Either way if you don't mind fanservice and like pervy comedy then you will like this show.",1417651200,,463,4.261363636363637

I started this anime with low expectations and found myself falling in love with the characters that are much more deep than they first appear. I love it when shows allow you to see how characters progress from what you thought they were. If you really want to dig down deep it is a show about human behavior and our way thinking. This is one of my favorite shows I have ever watched, if you can get past all of Tomoki's pervy behavior then you will find a really good show.",1417478400,,545,4.150943396226415

I've read up on it from reviews and seen pictures of the characters.
It was quite exciting to watch and funny. Loved the nudity! Though I

4849651,3,B005NQ5LPK,"Heaven's Lost Property is a very difficult show to pin down.

The first half of the show is consistently hilarious. The jokes come fast and furious, and not a one of them is appropriate for a younger audience.  While there is no outright nudity, there is a near constant barrage of women's undergarments.  They aren't just for show, though.  No, they fly, blow up, and at one point there is even a robot completely made out of panties. When the show is working as a straight forward ecchi comedy, it works.

Then the last part of the show kicks in, and the story picks up and suddenly things get more serious... and dark. Very dark. The violence is kicked up a notch, characters are tortured in horrific ways, there are brutal battles, and the humor from the early parts of the show falls to the wayside.  While the ending is very well done, and adequately ties up the first season, it also takes some time to adjust to the darker, and at times disturbing tone of the episodes.

One other issue I had with the series, going along with the uneven nature of the storytelling, is the uneven portrayal of its main character.  He can be a complete pervert, a sweet guy and a real jerk.  It's that last trait that makes it difficult to root for him, as he spends a good deal of time yelling at and belittling some of the female characters.  Obviously this show is aimed at a straight male audience, with its heavy doses of fan service on display, but the sheer misogyny at times can be very off putting, and made me nearly stop watching. The show features a bunch of half naked women with collars on their necks who have masters, so already the show is starting off on very rocky ground when it comes to the representation of its female characters.

I enjoyed Heaven's Lost Property.  The comedy worked, and worked well.  The show is very creative in the way it seems to both parody harem comedies, while also playing right to that audience with heavy doses of fan service and a growing number of female characters surrounding the perverted male lead.  Also, the series has some of the best closing animation ever.  Each episode has an individual closing credit animation which pokes fun at a specific theme or genre.

Animation is crisp and beautiful, character designs are strong and distinct without being distracting and the English dub (which is the version I watched) is very well done, with the cast handling everything from the zany humor to the dark and disturbing material wonderfully.

Heaven's Lost Property is an interesting ecchi sci-fi show that doesn't always seem to understand what it wants to be.  While I enjoyed it, I'm not sure I'm going to give the second season a try unless I can be sure that the sever tonal issues are handled better. The show has issues, just as any fan service shows do, but with this one it becomes just a bit more troublesome do to some questionable decisions in characterization and story.",1415750400,,2931,4.582375478927203

I was never bored with it, and was always compelled to watch the next episode. I think proof of this is that I watched the series in 1 day! I loved this, and it should appeal to you if you liked series like Chobits (it almost had that type of feel). Be prepared for tons of fanservice, however they didn't go so far as to add nudity.

4849667,5,B005NQ5LPK,"How about giving Heavens Lost Property an Emmy!? The Bill Cosby Show received a national Emmy Award because it gave us new, positive information about African-Americans. When there is a lack of adequate information, superstition, mystification and projective activities flourish. Heavens Lost Property performs a function similar to The Bill Cosby Show as regards those of us who have come to develop a preference for the imaginary. We see the words pervert and perversion bandied about many anime these days. I much prefer the term 'a preference for the imaginary.' In Saint Genet, Sartre wrote, Some men would prefer the worst whore in Paris to the solitary act, but there are some who actually come to prefer the imaginary. (paraphrasing)
  Heavens Lost Property helps us to laugh, as an audience, at our sexual idiosyncrasies. Thus we learn that those activities are not so uncommon, so dark and singular; we no longer have to withdraw from the classroom, from the workplace; we no longer need forgo job opportunities, education opportunities, simply because we feel that we are different than all others. This is to perform a real social healing. This anime does all that with great art style, comedy and interesting physics implications to ponder. The story and characters are quite well done, too. I highly recommend it.",1401148800,,1327,5.110599078341014

Without a doubt, this is a fanservice series, which may not be to everyone's tastes: lots of cute girls, skimpy clothing, exposed flesh and suggestive situations. The main character, Tomo, is an unabashed pervert. Plenty of humor if you like slapstick, or epic buildups that end in predictable failure.

But his wish gets thrown out the window when he goes out to a hill on behalf of the NEW WORLD club president to observe an unusual sighting, only to have Iconic pillars and other debris fall on him from the sky, including a lovely angelic form.  She introduces herself as Ikaros, a pet class angeloid, and him as her new master.  But owning this heavenly beauty might be more than he bargained for as he must now deal with a sadistic class president (is there any other type?), the president of the NEW WORLD club, his next door neighbor who despite beating him up over his perverted actions, secretly wants him to do some of those things to her, but also other angeloids who come to reclaim Ikaros as she holds a secret so powerful that it could shatter his illusions of normalcy (not that panty robots, bloomer bombs, and being turned into girl could be considered normal).

WARNING:  THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR CHILDREN.  There is plenty of fan service, flesh showing and other more adult themes in this show.

I personly enjoyed the show due to its creative storyline that is unlike any I've seen. Bizarre things of which I would never have even imagined had ever been imagined! Perhaps this is why I found this show clever and amusing. But, I don't get much television and so I'm about 15 years off movie/show theme and plots.

4849682,1,B005NQ5LPK,"After one episode I told myself it really can't be that bad and a few episodes in I don't know why I continued to watch... maybe its because its predecessors did it so much better that I had high expectations.  The main character is a letch, 75% of the women are mental cases in one form or another and god the voice acting is awful (yes I sadly watched it in English on Netflix).  I am sorry but can Funimation please find someone more tolerable than Greg Ayres to do the voice of every awful male lead they have?  Plus we know Ikaros isn't exactly meant to be an intelligent angeloid, but that doesn't mean we have to listen to talented Brittney Karbowski speak a dead monotonous voice throughout the entire series.

If you are looking for something better, I'd say watch only the first season of Mahoromatic (the second season is just awful),  Hell I'd even say skip the Sci-Fi and hit up Love Hina (just avoid the awful dub job on there as well).  You can even find humor in shows like Chobits or Ai Yori Aoshi...  JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS..",1389830400,,1061,4.38265306122449

The plot seemed dragged out too in the beginning; I was wondering too long who this person was/what that person's motive was. It picked up though about halfway through.

Even so, I ended up laughing (like the ""stupid"" funny kind of laugh) it off and rolling to the next scene. If you like all that ecchi stuff, you'll eat this up.

entertaining enough to warrant the purchase of the first season. I had expected a simple lighthearted harem comedy and was pleasantly surprised to find that it also contained an underlying dramatic story.

Her master (I don't even remember his name and guess what...I don't CARE!!!) rarely, if ever, gets into legitimate danger that requires her to come to the rescue. I seem to recall once he took a bath in some sacred bath house. This offended some powerful crime lord and he was going to be killed for it (what?). Ikaros came to the rescue. That's the only ""adventure"" I remember. Not to mention the fact that the kid was rude throughout the season. He belittled and insulted Ikaros throughout the season (I have three more episodes to watch). It would be different if he matured and grew as a person as the season progressed, but that's not happening.

Once i saw the first episode, I thought that there wasn't going to be a plot and that it was just going to be a fan-service anime, boy was I wrong after watching the second episode did I realized that it had potential.
Sure you have your standard harem characters with a male living by himself, some tsunderes, a childhood friend, innocent girl, etc.
The story was adapted from the manga with minor changes which is great as it still gives off the vibe of the manga, so if you're a fan of the manga you might not even notice the changes and for those that watched the anime and decide to pick up the manga you won't notice changes.",1358380800,,753,4.2

This one also made me laugh out loud and had everything from Flying panties to Exploding panties.  If you enjoy fan service and like to laugh buy this one. If you want a serious plot dont.

While light on plot the main story is there to keep the show on track (they take an episode off here or there just for fun)but its never really resolved.  I must admit season one was loads of laughs but hey I am a guy.  I will also say that this is only season one and I have already watched season 2(its even better).  Its funnier than say Rosario+Vampire(A great anime)but a little less focused on plot.  If you watch it do so for the laughs and perverted humor.

It is a harem style comedy so it has girls all wanting to marry this one guy.  The main character is a likeable pervert on a mission.  He just wants peace and quiet but an angeloid falls to the earth and ruins everything. He spends most of his time peeping and groping girls and they often take revenge on him.

I don't want to spoil it but the harem has 4 girls only three are in the first season.  The fourth comes in at season 2 and is more comedy relief than anything else.  So far season 2 has my two favorite episodes.  You must be a pervert to understand most of the humor so if your not don't bother.",1357689600,,1401,4.156133828996283

Now back to the story, This anime is about a boy with some anime jap name (sorry im not good with names) that has all these odd dreams then on the 1st eqisode he finds this angel being falling from the sky and decides to save her, in return she becomes his master which at 1st for me was kind of odd but as it progresses it gets alot better. In this there is alot of emotional drama in a very good way it almost makes you feel sad an happy at the same time, its hard to explain without seeing it for your self. Animes are the only shows that can show you things that are not possible in the real world, like flying angels (im not sayin they don't exist, im just saying you are not seeing them out your window all day long), or all sorts of crazy stuff happening and alot of it is really funny, infact on the 2-4 shows out of this season i believe it was, i could not stop from laughing its just what was said an what you saw that made it so funny lol

Anyways to make a long story short, if you love semi-perverted almost nude angel-like chicks with wings flying around granting you anything you want including turning you from a boy to a girl to sneak into the girls locker room (which happens) then this is for you lol.

There is a lot to this anime as it has it's sentimental moments and it's moments of brash comedy. It's humor can be described as lewd to an extent, as it has a major sense of fan-service. If you are looking for an anime that is funny, a little ecchi, and can still maintain a decent story, then this is a good anime for you. Needless to say I went out and bought the second season the same night I got done watching the first, so that has to say something!

Pros- Great animation, characters are very gorgeous. Humor is good and so is audio. (Eng and Jap)
Cons- No real storyline-and i wish the character Ikaros (Icarus) developed a liiiittle more as far as personality goes.

It's about a teen named Tomoki (Tomo) who is obsessed with bras, panties, and the female species. I thought this was not the show for me cause I was never into this kind of show. However my friend recommended it to my and I was hooked from the beginning. For those of you who watch the first episode and say ""this is stupid and random. where is the story?"" I will let you know there is a story. The story doesn't emerge until like episode 8 but it does get extremely good after that. Anything before episode 8 is basically setting the ground for the story to appear as well as to lay down each character's personality.

4849740,4,B005NQ5LPK,"This review for is for Season One of Heaven's Lost Property (Sora No Otoshimino) and applies to what you will be purchasing with this review.

This is certainly something out of some high school freshman's fantasy. An angel (called angeloid) falls from the sky one day, and Tomoki, our main character, his carefree life is thrown into an uproar, as now he is now...master. Everything he could possibly imagine is now at his fingertips, literally and figuratively. Without giving too much away, this is what we call a harem echhi anime. This means lots of girls...use your imagination. This is what we call fan service in anime (panty shots, etc. for this type) This anime consistently ranks in the top three of the genre on fan service alone. So if this is your cup of tea, currently, you can not go wrong with this one.

The music is solid, opening with ""Ring my Bell"" OP and ending with a different ED for each episode. The English casting was well done. There is a limited edition version, where there are a nominal improvements, but artistically, there isn't much difference. Overall, very solid work by Funimation.

I have tried to come up with something to conclude this review, but the only thing that comes to mind is ribald comedy. However, to me, it's just comedy. I found myself laughing over and over. A recommended purchase.",1345161600,,1337,4.7296137339055795
4849741,5,B005NQ5LPK,"Heaven's Lost Property is the combination of perverted teenage hormones with the basis of celestial beings based off of Greek Mythology.
Almost immediately, you will fall in love with the characters as each one has their own importance to the storyline and provides a great degree of humor along with the protagonist.
As I followed Tomoki Sakurai on his shameless perversions, I enjoyed watching the character interact with his Angeloid, Ikaros, his neighbor Sohara, and his friends.  Since Ikaros is somewhat emotionless in the first 6 episodes, she does not quite understand the magnitude of his perversions.  However, you can notice immediately that Tomoki does not try anything towards her for some reason...
I loved the characters, I found myself hating the antagonist of the story, and I enjoyed every minute of each episode, almost wishing they wouldn't end after 25 minutes.  This is definitely one of the better anime's out there and having it is a must for those who enjoy perverted humor and understanding the power of the human condition...",1344556800,,1052,5.104651162790698

There is no full nudity, even though it comes close a couple times (The important parts are covered up.), its all done in a silly manner and not meant to be dirty.  It is another harem style anime, since the main guy get teamed up with a group of angeloid girls that want him to be their master.  One of his friends is curious as to where these robotic angels are coming from and tries to find out who is making them and how they came to be.  Their origin seems to be linked to the dreams the main character keeps having about a strange place with a real angel girl in it.  When Ikaros (The pink/black haired girl on the cover of the box.) landed on earth the main guy carried her back to his house to try and help her, since she is a pet class angeloid (serves every wish of her master.), she believes he is her master when her system reboots.  The main guy soon finds that Ikaros can grant his wishes with magical cards and has pervy fun with those wishes, while his childhood friend (a girl) tries to keep him in line when she catches him being perverted (Usually by beating him up a little, in a silly way.  Not a harsh violent way.).  Over all I was pleasantly surprised how silly and fun this show is.

4849744,5,B005NQ5LPK,"It's hard to say in a sentence what this series is about. Yeah, there's a truckload of ecchi humor full of bizarre panty situations, massive-breasted and beautiful ""pet"" angels that will do literally anything you want (don't worry, this isn't beaten around, and the main character tries the obvious wish in the very first episode). There's a great cast of characters each funny in their own unique way (the class president, the mix student who is both an emotionless fan of ecchi as well as a philosopher and scientist, and, uh, lives in the woods in a tent while commuting to school, and arguably everyone's favorite, Ikaros, the initially highly ditzy and totally emotionless servant angel that grants any wish at all--but be careful what you wish for with her), and the quickly-introduced tsundere loli angel--who happens to have an incredibly disturbing and dark past, as well as a hostility toward Ikaros. Oh yeah, and both angels initially go to school without really caring about it, and as you'd expect, their lockers are literally spilling with love letters due to how ridiculously attractive they are.

A *lot* happens in every episode, so there's a ton of content packed into the brevity of only around a dozen episodes. Hell, in the first episode alone, the world ends because the main character makes an unfortunate wish with unintended consequences. Yeah, seriously. Every episode has so much content that happens at a rocketing pace, and the sense of humor remains truly excellent throughout. The writing for the dub is wonderfully natural and keeps the original's idea without sacrificing anything in the just-American-enough translation. Huge kudos to both the writers and dubbers, who do a stunningly graceful job of making everything sound perfectly natural and adding their own flavors into the mix with welcome results.

Basically, this is, for the most part, a comedy anime at first--but the story, once our loli tsundere angel shows up (oddly with the name ""Nymph""), starts to get really, really dark--really, really fast. Without spoilers, the pasts of each angel, Ikaros and Nymph, respectively, are rather horrifying, particularly Nymph, who is forced to act like she enjoys constant physical and verbal abuse under her masters, who do some truly malicious and painful things to her that only escalate.

It's deeper than it looks. Really, unless you just don't like ecchi humor at all or the idea of a ""pet-class angel"", this is a beautifully put together anime. It's hilarious, it's disturbing, it's original, it's got an exceptional dub, and it looks gorgeous in high-def, which can't be said for a lot of anime on Blu-ray, which truly looks little different from the DVD.

Unfortunately, as everyone knows by now, season 2 of this did not get the Blu-ray treatment, which really did not go over well with people who loved the vibrant, crisp, stunningly gorgeous work done here. Nope, DVD-only at this point for season 2, which doesn't look to be changing any time soon. That's a shame beyond measure, as this is one of the few cases when Blu-ray makes a clear difference.

Still, that's outside this product alone, which is worth every penny for anyone with the slightest interest in its premise. Although it does mislead a bit, as it does not stay a lighthearted comedy the whole time with your typical ""master and slave"" setup and ecchi humor, and every episode is so mind-bogglingly fast that this definitely has no issue with pacing.

Truly a top-grade anime on several levels. If all you care about is the initial premise, or you just really like Ikaros and/or Nymph (who couldn't?) and can appreciate some of its more subtle humor that is not ecchi-related, you'll have no problem at all getting into this. It's definitely the best of the best in its dub, as well as in its very original comedy that never gets repetitive and is always changing.

Anyone with the slightest interest at all will no doubt eat this exceptionally made anime up like candy.",1343347200,6,3986,4.940298507462686

I say this because approximately 90% of them are dreadful wastes of space, aimed at the lowest-of-the-low demographic in order to make a few quick n' dirty bucks. Most people know to avoid these like the plague, and certainly know better than to shell out over 40 dollars for a deluxe set of them. But where does that leave the other 10%? In an interesting position, that's where. This smaller percentage contains shows that have merit (see: Sekirei), and rarely, are actually excellent shows (see: Queen's Blade.) While it falls in the former category of such shows, ""Heaven's Lost Property"" still rests squarely within that 10%.

It achieves this goal by not attempting to be anything it's not. The writers (especially in the English dub) are well-aware that the very concept of this show is ludicrous wish fulfillment. Here we have an unabashedly perverted teenage boy given complete control over Ikaros, an angel that has fallen from heaven, who informs him that she can grant any desire he may have. Instead of being romantic and cheesy, yet coyly being perverted like so many male protagonists, Tomoki starts using this ability to gratify his puerile desires. These include, but are not limited to: wishing for all of the panties from girls within a multi-mile radius, turning himself invisible so he can rub naked against girls, and turning himself into girl to sneak into a bathhouse. Despite some glimmers of goodness, this protagonist is perhaps the biggest perv this side of a non-hentai title, and it's delightful to see him run amok as opposed to being forced into sitting through yet another anime where the ""hero"" is always a lovable oaf.

What prevents his behavior from becoming unbearable, though, is a delightful supporting cast. Just when you begin to grow weary of Tomoki's shenanigans, his childhood friend Sohara karate chops him, or his oddball friend Eishiro goes on a long rant about discovering the elusive ""New World."" Later on, the focus falls on Ikaros, who is utterly clueless when it comes to behaving like normal human, and angelic cohort/token loli Nymph, whose condescending demeanor towards humans is always reliable for a laugh. The most standout character in my eyes, however, was class president Mikako. She is utterly grimy, delighting in causing Tomoki endless torment and routinely laughing at others' misfortunes. Unforgettably sadistic, and surprisingly versatile in the show's myriad of different situations, Mikako is in fact one of the best things about the series, mainly because you never know what she's going to do next.

But unpredictability isn't exclusive to that one character in ""Heaven's Lost Property"", being one of the traits that actually defines the experience of watching the show. There are things that occur within the 13-episode confines of this show that I guarantee you will never see in another anime. I can list no other show in which panties are rigged throughout a house to serve as dangerous landmines, or where a perverted male delights so much in being turned into a girl that he begins to enjoy flirting with boys and dressing up in sultry undergarments. What prevents this from falling into the pitfalls of other ecchi series is that the writers were able to distance themselves from being remotely serious most of the time, and what occurred was like a Japanese anime equivalent of ""Benny Hill.""

The operative phrase there was ""most of the time"", because near the series' climax, the direction definitely shifts in a darker direction. Some downright unpleasant images related to the Angeloid's past lives are detailed, and the focus on Ikaros' role as a world-ending tool of destruction is highlighted. While I appreciated that the show was attempting to make us feel some sense of urgency, these components fall short of their potential and ultimately stick out like a sore thumb in this otherwise lighthearted series. The last two episodes are the most guilty perpetrators of this, and seem to be comprised of tropes from a few different shows. I believe, given the sub-plot beneath the fan service and comedy, it would be fair to call ""Heaven's Lost Property"" something along the lines of ""Saikano with more boobs.""

Production values are a mixed bag here. At first glance the animation looks pretty, but it quickly grows a bit too simplistic and oriented towards primary colors for my tastes. While it's nowhere near what could be classified as ""bad"", this show definitely isn't one that you watch for production values. Oddly, it seems to improve as the show gets closer to it's end, perhaps in an attempt to reverse the typical trend of letting animation slip as a series wears on. Where the visuals fail in some departments, though, an unbelievably good soundtrack picks up the slack. So many shows have merely forgettable background music, but not HLP. It was one of the rare musical treats that stands out while watching the show, and it's preceded by a really great opening theme with pretty animation. Another unique quirk here is the unique ending each episode, matching whatever theme or plot that episode followed. Overall, the audio and visual departments in this show are above average for something of this type, especially in the former's case.

FUNimation's dub is one of the best parts of this show, and may be the best thing for it's overseas release. While the cast in the original JP voice track are all very talented in their own right, I felt that they were taking it a bit too seriously for it to come across as funny. This is a pitfall too many shows in this vein fall into. On the other hand, we have a truly zany dub, complete with liberal uses of profanity and slang, and little asides that actually spice up the show moreso than the original voice track. Greg Ayres as Tomoki is especially hysterical as Tomoki, showing a tender side while making him just whiny enough to make you annoyed at the right times. Not to pick favorites, but my favorite dub V.A. here is hands-down Jamie Marchi as Mikako, who takes the beautiful sadist's personality and just runs with it, riffing (and often seemingly improvising) the funniest and cruelest dialogue you can imagine. Everything from her booming laugh to honey-dripping snarl is spot-on. The one complaint I have is directed towards Brittney Karbowski, who does a serviceable job as Ikaros for the most part, but falls flat when it comes to singing. It may seem unfair to compare her to career singer and idol Saori Hayami, who took the role in the original voice track, but Karbowski's voice simply doesn't have the range or hold as much interest as Hayami's. She's a talented voice actress, actually one of my favorites, but this just isn't her best role.

I picked up this show on a whim, and up until watching it, I kind of scoffed at it's fans. It took actually sitting down with it for me to come to the conclusion that, despite it's flaws, this is an enjoyable and entertaining show. Despite some dips in animation quality and the shoehorning of serious plot elements near the end as opposed to natural progression, there's nothing that would dissuade me from recommending this to anybody who doesn't take themselves too seriously and is willing to turn off their brains for a fun time. Because one can only take a show that features a giant robot comprised of exploding panties too seriously.

This series is a perfect example. Look at the cover, right away you accept that this isn't going to be a heart pounding sci-fi thriller, or have an intricately woven plot with countless twists. You're getting boobs, laughs, fan service, and ridiculous scenarios; all of which are in high supply and you'll love every second of it. I found the characters to be refreshing, the music was great and when the show did get to its darker side, which admittedly isn't for very long, it gets rather intense. I've shown this show to several different friends, all with different tastes (some don't even like anime in general) and they all liked it.

4849766,3,B005NQ5LPK,"In a sentence: This anime series features a lot of adult natured ecchi comedy with minimal redeeming qualities.

If you are looking for something deep, look elsewhere. There is no thinking involved in this series and the characters are void of many interesting qualities. The main character Tomoki (voiced by Greg Ayres) is definitely the best part of the show as he is the main catalyst for much of mischief and comedy involved in the series. There is really no meaningful story, except for the final episode or two when they try to tie everything up and jam it down your throat at the last second because it is ending. But for this type of genre, I guess that is somewhat expected. That said, I still made it through the series and enjoyed most of it. It can be funny at times and it is very ecchi most of the time. If you are looking for something different, give it a try, but with so many other great series out there, you really will not be missing anything if you skip over this title.

Animation is good, character models are good, humor can be good, story is non-existant, pretty mindless most of the time, probably not a repeat viewing in my future.

4849769,5,B005NQ5LPK,"Pros:
Extremely hilarious, great artwork and animation, lot's of fan-service, and cool battles.

Cons:
The wait for series 2 sora no otoshimono :forte
and the movie sora no otshimono :the angeloid of clockwork.

Other Thoughts:
Sora no otoshimono is a fairly straightforward anime following tomoki a boy who's only interest is peace and quiet, until the day he finds himself being shadowed by ikaros who claims she is a pet type angeloid and claims tomoki is her master.
and when she demonstrates her abilities and tells tomoki she can grant his wishes his interest in the perverted arts surface with a vengeance with the ensuing hilarious consequences needing to be seen to be believed.
but it's not all comedy there is a little intrigue/drama some sadness and some cool battles but i won't go into the story anymore as it will destroy the plot.
all i will say is you will not be disappointed by this anime but be prepared there is a lot of fan-service in the show, and i mean a lot.
and also once again funimation have released a blu-ray combo set that works for the U.K market because the blu-rays work in my ps3 and the dvds work in my laptop (the only non multi-region dvd player in my house)

4849775,5,B005NQ5LPK,"I really liked this show. The humor is very lowbrow and some of the plots get really dirty. It is not something a person would want to just tune into to fill a day without looking into first. That said, it is really funny and definitely worth watching.

On some levels, this show has a linear plot line that can progress from episode to episode. It deals with an angel and the boy she belongs to and her ability to give him anything he wants. Did I mention he is really, really, obsessed with females and their undergarments? Well, that comes up a lot, as does his connection to his childhood friend/neighbor/possible love interest. There are two other characters as well, the class president and the boy who wants to fly, and another angel evening out a cast that adds a lot to the humor.

Here's an example of a plot line, to see if it is something you would watch, noting this is done with humor but that it also involves some nudity and crass comments/suggestions. Having caused an issue with his angel that ended up causing a flock of flying lady's undergarments, our main ends up with a home filled with colors that the growing boy covets. His neighbor, not thrilled, asks the angel for help and gets her to make any of these our main looks at to explode. This leads to a lot of issues for him considering how the put them on everything, walls, lines, even the goldfish. (wording chosen so not to be edited)

You also have a more serious portion of the show that deals with the angel and its original intent. It was apparently quite the killer in the past and Heaven wants it back. Apparently many male angels are sadists, too, and they send another angle to retrieve the first. This storyline brings some violence to the show, and it also makes one understand even more why this type of angel exists.

5/5, just be aware of the type of show you're getting. also, get this on bluRay while its around because it is definitely much better to watch, with a lot better sound than the SD format.",1330473600,33,1996,4.430517711171662

Not for kids, as there is a lot of fan service, but the quality of the blu-ray was really nice and I hope that season two is done as well.

One thing that I did not like about this version was the English dubbing.  In Japanese, the main character sounds as if she either doesn't have or doesn't understand many emotions.  To her, what is happening is normal.  However, they played up the sexual aspect of the character in the English dubbing and she sounds very suggestive and playful.  These don't really match the story or the original character.  Because of this, I prefer this series in Japanese with subtitles instead.

Amazon was great with replacing the damaged case (broken during assembly, as the outer box of the box set was perfect).  Real fast and very simple.

 Heaven's Lost Property is a great anime. It has a lot of ecchi or perverted scenes but it is not so much the main focus. More so it is a device to drive the natural and somewhat surprisingly intelligent comedy with some real emotional moments. The characters are all likable and well written. The Voice acting is some of the best voice acting I have heard in anime. Nothing can make someone's emotions flinch more than when you hear a voice cracking while crying. As well as at no point did I feel that I was missing out on jokes because of a Japanese cultural difference. And as someone with a short attention span nor did I ever feel they went too long without having something of interest.
