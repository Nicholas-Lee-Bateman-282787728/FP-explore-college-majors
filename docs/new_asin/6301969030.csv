393652,5,6301969030,"I never felt this film received the acclaim it should have.  Glenn Ford and Charles Boyer gave good performances in this film. This is not a movie with a lot of war scenes, it has to do with the lives of those families involved in the French resistance and the dangers they faced.

Bashing the rating of this  film because of WB providing this film cheaper, has nothing to do with the movie itself.  I checked out the price, if I had bought it through them, I would have paid almost the same  after paying for shipping.",1272931200,7,519,4.309278350515464
393653,4,6301969030,"Not the movie itself, mind you, which I've enjoyed ever I first saw it on TV in the early 80's. While not on the same level as the Valentino classic of 40 years earlier, there is a lot to enjoy here, with a somewhat miscast Glenn Ford (original choice Alain Delon might have been better) the only weak link in an otherwise solid, stellar cast. Likewise, Andre Previn's score is one of his best, with a beautiful love theme that I've never gotten out of my head despite the passage of almost 30 years.

No, the flaws lie in the fact that there are no captions nor any real chapter index to this DVD. Warners is usually so scrupulous about this, so I wonder what happened here.

Other than that, no complaints, though. Try it, you'll like it.",1266969600,,740,4.355072463768116
393654,5,6301969030,"I have noticed that someone keeps bashing these WB offerings as being piratical or some other BS. Actually, the truth of the matter is, if you have Amazon Prime, the $26.00 total price is almost exactly the amount you would pay from the WB site, after they add their own shipping cost per individual item. Now, if you do not have Amazon Prime, you would be better off buying from the WB site, as the Amazon price you see listed is BEFORE they add shipping and handling. I know this because I have purchased DVDs from the WB site. This product offering isn't piracy - Amazon just bought the WB product and is offering it at a higher price, which is absolutely unethical, but it is their site, they can do what they want.

393656,5,6301969030,"In the opinion of this reviewer, this is far and away THE most underrated, underappreciated, and under-deserved film ever made.

No, Glenn Ford is not Valentino.  But he brings his own personal  brand of warmth, feeling, refinement, and particularly  his trademark, unparalleled elegance to the role of the otherwise disreputable, antiheroic Julio, who eventually becomes, yes, every bit as heroic as Rick Blaine in ""Casablanca.""

Ingrid Thulin matches Mr. Ford in elegance and refinement, as well as gracing the screen with an enduring, radiant beauty, and, if that's Angela Lansbury's voice emanating from her lips, more power to it; its tones are a perfect fit for the exquisite creature with whose lips it is precisely synchronized.

Paul Henreid recreates an almost identical version of Victor Laszlo, except that he doesn't make it to the plane this time. Charles Boyer and Paul Lucas are, as always, superb as the respective fathers of the French and German strains of the Argentine protagonist family. And Karl Boehm essays the definitive SS officer, as do the character actors who portray the remaining Nazi brass with whom he and his cousin, Julio, covort in the smoke filled dens of wartime Paris.

But the film essentially belongs to Lee J. Cobb, whose character dies in the first 20 minutes, but whose farewell premonition and curse upon the ""seed of my seed"" cannot help but bring the iciest of chills to the very marrow of anyone with otherwise warm blood coursing through his or her veins.

That this movie lost six million dollars at the box office and has been pilloried by many self-described experts, including the reviewer for the ""All Movie Guide,"" is no more than a testament to the aphorism  that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It is difficult to  divine a reason why any viewer would not bask in the  breathtaking performances, rich storyline, exquisite color, and high drama of this uniquely compelling film.

It will tear at the essence of your soul, and, if your heart beats but faintly, you will be unable to prevent yourself from crying aloud during its more poignant moments, particularly the revelation of Chi Chi's death at the hands of Nazi interrogators, and the final denouement, including the line selected as the title of this review.

No, this film does not have the wealth of memorable lines, or the hilarious ensemble of second tier performers who filled the screen with parenthetical  wit and charm in ""Casablanca.""  No one expresses  ""shock"" that gambling is going on, and there is no ""fat hypocrite"" who takes pride in being ""respected"" as the ""leader of all illegal activities"" in the city of its setting.

But, for the sheer mesmerizing effect of a heartwrenching story, coupled with a vivid, eternally topical reminder of the unimaginable sacrifices that were made by our parents and grandparents to defeat the  essence of pure, unadorned evil that was Nazism and Fascism, this film is every bit as timeless and special, and belongs right along side the greatest of our cinematic pantheon of postcards to that ghastly and hopefully never-to-be relived era of unprecedented bravery and self-sacrifice.",1145750400,23,3154,5.009578544061303
393657,5,6301969030,"""THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE."" This spectacular film is a world-renowned classic of love and war. It was released in Cinemascope by MGM in 1961. A Julian Blaustein Production, Directed by Vincente Minnellii, that features an international cast of actors spanning two continents. Starring: Glenn Ford, Ingrid Thulin, Charles Boyer, Lee J. Cobb and Paul Heinreid, Co-starring: Paul Lucas, Yvette Mimeux and Kael Boehm. Screenplay by Robert Ardrey and John Gay. Based on the novel by Vicente Blasco Ibaez.

The story starts in 1938 at a large state in Argentina just when the world is poised on the brink of WWII. It brings together three generations of a wealthy family of French and German ancestry at a bash reunion to celebrate the birthday of its multi-millionaire absolute ruler and patriarch.

It's a searing drama in which the Nazi monster sets brother against brother, while following this family's destructive linkup to the siniester horrors of Nazi Germany in Europe.

A perfect match for another very profitable Warner Brothers's DVD released dealing with this Nazi subject matter: The legendary Luchino Visconti's ""THE DAMNED.""

This fascinating Hollywood's feature film, whose copyrights are now owned by TIME-WARNER INC. through their ""MGM/UA Turner Film Library"" is unfortunately still sitting idle at this studio ""Classic Films Vault."" Been regrettably neglected by the company executives without any official date for its anamorphic widescreen restoration released on DVD.

A tragic case of a terrible oversight and abadom, particularly when the lessons presented by this movie plot, can be very apropos for the times we live. Please TIME -WARNER hear the cries from this reviewer and made a resounding success DVD from this pre-vietnam era feature film. THANKS!!!!",1124323200,16,1788,5.371428571428571
393658,5,6301969030,"Even tho this is one of George Dolenz's last films before his death in 1963.  This movie had a bit of a chill on what was it like during the war.  I think (since I run a site on George) he should've been seen more in it than in the mid point, then at the very end...but still casted.  I don't know what was up with that.
If you are a fan of movies that were made around this time that take place in another war, this has to be one of your films then.  But Glenn Ford did a marvelous job in this film, this would have to go on your list if you are a fan of his.  But I enjoyed this movie, wouldn't be in my top 10 list it would maybe be in my top 20 of films of the Dolenzes.",998265600,5,674,3.6206896551724137
393659,2,6301969030,"Those people with five stars for this must betongue-in-cheek.
I was going along with this movie for the first twenty minutes. I was rolling over laughing.  The film's title is reinforced periodically throughout the two and a half hours with these horsemen-in-the-clouds images.  But this is not really the bad part of the movie.
Some of the marginal characters might have been interesting, but the central character is Julio.  Julio is a gutless, selfish, unimaginative playboy.  Glenn Ford so convicingly played Julio as oblivious to the surrounding circumstances that I found it very difficult to remember that he's not supposed to be an actor in 1961.  Nevertheless, I got the impression that the viewer is supposed to sympathise with him.  And the melodramatic music, never subtle, always seems to follow his self-absorbed emotions.  Personally, I was begging for any character in the movie to punch this guy in the face, knock him down, and let's look for somebody worthwhile to follow around Paris.
With the plot following Julio, it never lives up to the passion of the grandfather's stormy kickoff.  We mostly watch Julio's attempts at romancing Marguerite get interrupted by what to him are the annoyances of war.  The juxtaposition of the two cousins, Julio and Heinrich, is never given much depth since Heinrich is simply a dead-set Nazi from beginning to end, and Julio doesn't believe in anything or care about anyone from beginning to end.  (And no similarity to Rick in Casablanca.)  Unlike some movies which add depth to their subject, this one just really hangs on war for what drama it can steal from it.  Two stars, just for the scenery, nothing terribly offensive, and the first twenty minutes with the grandfather in Argentina.  END",967939200,8,1752,5.02076124567474

393802,4,6301969030,"Apparently people who know the novel, or who know the silent movie with Rudolph Valentino, did not like this version. So be it. For me, I did not read the novel nor did I see the silent opus. Among the complaints: Originally the story was a World War 1 story, this is a World War 2 story. World War 2 is more than sufficiently apocalyptical for me. Rudolph Valentino was persuasive as a latin lover in 1924 -- Glenn Ford circa 1960 is not. Ford is not a sex machine on the prowl. Ford portrays a mostly amoral hedonist taking his earthly pleasures in Nazi occupied Paris from June, 1940 to spring 1944. As the Parisians suffer, Ford dresses elegantly, eats like an epicure, dances in the finest surroundings, lives in a high ceilinged high priced apartment with a view, and spends money like the rich superannuated playboy that he is. On its own terms it is a first rate soap opera in which suspense slowly builds for more than two and a half hours.

394038,2,6301969030,"Despite an enormous moment in history as backdrop, director Vincente Minnelli limits the scope of THE 4 HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE to a handful of rooms. A few outdoor scenes of the City of Light that include actors may be them in front of hazy projections. An overloud, cloying music track meant to tug at one's heart has an opposite effect, it distracts the viewer.

We begin with an Argentine street festival that is backlot all the way. Cut to a family celebration which quickly turns tragic, then zip, boom! we and most of the family are in Paris (or a ROOM in Paree) shortly before it's invaded. Perhaps the original novel's size necessitated such episodic jumps.

Lee J. Cobb has too-little time as a cantankerous Argentine grandpa who drops dead after learning at the aforementioned party that one grandson is a N&aacute;zi. Glenn Ford can't muster enough charisma for the romantic lead. His love interest, Ingrid Thulin has flown-in dialogue voiced by Angela Lansbury. Yvette Mimieux's lines are re-recorded and sometimes out-of-synch.

Paul Henreid's role is difficult: a French Resistance leader arrested more than once who's eventually battered into the grave. Makeup and Henreid's performance are most convincing. Use of voiceover specialist Paul Frees would've been more effective if two of his familiar accents didn't overlap. First he's a Frenchman driving Ford to Normandy, then immediately after and in-between, Frees supplies the voice of a British officer.

No sympathy here for the adulterous lead characters, so their love story and 2.5 hours of footage are wasted on me. As a fan of so many of Minnelli's movies, my reasonable expectations for this epic were surprisingly and decidedly dashed. ""Horsemen"" is a misfire, the sort that gives classic movies a black eye. Thumbs down!

394039,4,6301969030,"Despite what critics have said of it, and never seeing the original 1921 silent with Valentino, I am not sure Glenn Ford was appropriate casting of the lead, an Argentinian, even with French in his blood, the rumored original choice by director Vincente Minnelli of Alain Delon would have probably been better, although I like Glenn Ford, but didn't he also say he has never played anyone but Glenn Ford in a movie?  I can't tell that Ingrid Thulin was dubbed by Angela Lansbury.  Why were there so many watermelons sliced in half going to waste in the first scenes with the patriarch Argentine played by Lee J. Cobb?  Most of Minnelli's choices of costumes and set decoration, etc. are exemplary and he directs the many spectacles we witness very well.  This is probably the last thing he directed of any consequence (excepting ""Goodbye Charlie"" a guilty pleasure) remembering he had very recently directed ""Gigi"" which had incredible sets, costumes, color and music.  Andre Previn again does the music (he also did the score for ""Goodbye Charlie"" which is one of my favorites).  Anyone who has heard his score of Otto Preminger's 1959 ""Porgy and Bess"" will understand why he deserved to win an Oscar for that and did.  Charles Boyer, Yvette Mimieux, Paul Heinreid and Karl Boehm are all excellent.  The script by Robert Ardrey and John Gay makes sense of what has been called an ""unreadable"" novel by Vicente Blasco Ibanez.  Some of it is eloquent.

Some of the family joins up with the Nazis, some join the French resistance and some, like Ford's character, try to pretend nothing has changed.

The story line is completely unbelievable to me most of the time, but Ford and the rest of the cast kept a mediocre story from turning into a very mediocre movie, and managed to make it better than it might otherwise have been.

Ford's character eventually decides, for no real reason that I could discern, to join the resistance. Turns out that the husband of the married woman he was having a long time affair with was the leader of the resistance.

Pretty much in the end, most of the family comes to tragic ends.

This is worth watching if you have nothing better to do, but it is not a classic in my book.",1374883200,,1102,4.4088669950738915

Also had rolling white lines in most of film.  Had to send back, unfotunately, and it was NEW, but these things happen sometimes w/ new discs.  Sure it was not Movie Mars' fault!

394134,4,6301969030,"After you get through the first 20 minutes, this very under-rated movie is a masterpiece. The introduction, with Leo J. Cobb as grandpa, seems way over the top even for its culture and time--rural Argentina, 1930's--but then we settle down and follow the fortunes of Leo's family and the fate of Paris during WWII, where some family members now live: one son-in-law a French dilettante, one a Nazi general, plus their wives and a three grandchildren, with two more in the wings. One grandson, Julio, is a careless seducer of an absent soldier's wife; one, the grand-daughter, is in the Paris resistance. One of the three Nazi grandsons, a particularly horrid specimen, shows up in Paris to antagonize us.

Paul Lukas, of course, gives a workmanlike performance as the German son-in-law, now turned Nazi occupier.  This is the best performance I've seen by Charles Boyer, especially in the moving scene where Boyer tries to bargain with Lukas over the fate of his daughter, now arrested and in the hands of Lukas' allies in the Gestapo. Swedish star Ingrid Thulin is decorative but unremarkable as the silly, shallow wife. Paul Henreid turns in his usual superb performance as Boyer's old friend, the husband of the faithless wife and a quiet patriot who can stand up to Gestapo torture once, but not twice. Meanwhile I wasn't bothered by Glenn Ford's presence as Julio in place of Rudolph Valentino: it's a different movie, that's all. Glenn Ford has presence, he's elegant in his frivolous, selfish way, and he convinces. Ford portrays a self-centered cad; but Julio can seduce us, too, to care about him in spite of his character, before he modifies it.

Finally, the real hero of the story is Paris. Minelli's vibrant colors--his trademark red in almost every scene--the details of cars, alleyways, antiques, clothing, the river flowing by the cathedral--draw us into it. In light or shadow, Paris seduces us,  too. We're in a city with its heroic past and its ironic present gorgeously laid out for its inhabitants, its Nazi soldier sightseers, and us.

I gave it four stars because of the first 20 minutes: after that, all gold.",1368230400,2,2133,4.913888888888889

394338,2,6301969030,"This line of DVDs is not a quality pressed production but a consumer dye based ""produced on a home computer type"" of DVD. This type of DVD is not expected to be as long lasting as the sliver color pressed type and is most likely to degrade as this is a less stable dye based DVD.  Furthermore, the printed material is of low quality too, no inserts, poor printing, poor graphics.  This line of DVDs appears to be produced upon order to avoid stocking and storage.  The price is far to high for these films; twice what it should be. This particular film is an all out hollywood epic by Vincente Minelli and well worth owning and certainly worth a much better quality transfer as there are very large pixels in all of the red areas of the film; what a disgrace and insult to the artistry of those who produced this film as well to those who might otherwise appreciate such a film.

But I can't understand the dialog, so there is no point in watching it.  I tried to return it but you have made it too difficult and expensive for me to do that, so no I am not satisfied. You might say I should have looked at the product description and I would have seen that there was no CC.  I did look but I have ordered movies and TV series that did not say CC before, but turned out that they were. So, I took the chance and lost.

394345,5,6301969030,"The horror of WWII seen through the eyes of the upper, upper class. The horror of WWII seen through the eyes of a romantic Argentinean caught up in Paris, wishing to look the other way but, through the love of a beautiful woman and the loss of his innocent sister to the Gestapo, must be forced to make a choice between ambivalence and his heart. His grandfather wanted to create a perfect world of love and peace on the pampas, but his heirs got sucked into Hitler's other dream of a perfect world, except for those who knew otherwise.

Damned by film critics when the film was released in the early 60's--Leonard Maltin refers to it as ""glossy trash""--director Vincente Minelli goes over the top, maybe too much so, in making the film absolutely beautiful to watch. Antique dealers will salivate at the sets. Haute couture costumes by Orry-Kelly make you scream. And never has the old adage ""clothes make the man"" been more evident. Top all this off with excellent acting, a succinct script, and the most beautiful and effective musical score Andre Previn ever wrote, and you have a classic.

Forget all the criticism about the film's miscasting. Glenn Ford is perfect, as he usually is, understated and subtle. Ingrid Thulin, despite rumors that she was dubbed by Angela Lansbury, is very much the beautiful lady. Lee J. Cobb, in an extremely pivotal role, sets the mark for Charles Boyer and Paul Henreid. They are all very fine.",1275782400,38,1433,4.728

7818616,4,6301969030,"Lavish production about a family divided by WW2 and the Nazi occupation of Paris, and the difficult decision of a neutral pacifist to join the French Resistance against the Nazis. Directed by the great Vincent Minelli, who experienced Nazi occupation first-hand, the movie is somewhat overr-produced, but its wonderful period atmosphere, sets & locations make it visually spectacular.

Despite high production values & a fine cast, it never quite lives up to it's epic proportions, yet remains well worth seeing as a story of how people are forced to grovel & debase themselves under an authoritarian regime, even those of a privileged class. While not exactly a thrilling war movie, it nevertheless a potent drama about the bitter ironies of war.
