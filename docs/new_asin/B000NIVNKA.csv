8178009,5,B000NIVNKA,"This DVD (needed a replacement ) has been watched for 10 years.
 Every time  Richard Freeman explains a pose, his words are heard differently with each viewing. .",1450051200,,162,4.75
8178010,2,B000NIVNKA,"On the video: I had seen this before and I decided to get it because it is amazing. Great video for accompanying your intermediate practice. It is not a great idea to learn the series from videos: you definitely need an instructor to learn the basics. This is not a video for people that have an ""intermediate yoga practice"", this is for people who have a full Primary series in the Ashtanga method. This might sound like a small detail, but trust me: it is not. An intermediate Ashtanga practice is something that takes years to achieve by practicing 6 days a week (not that I am that disciplined). In this method, the teacher hands you each pose when you are ready for it. Do not buy it thinking that this is appropriate for your body if you have not been practicing Ashtanga for at least a couple years.

On the seller: they sent me an introductory video. Bad seller, good product",1428019200,2,883,4.450617283950617
8178011,4,B000NIVNKA,Excellent Yoga instruction but for very advanced and conditioned practitioners.,1421625600,,79,7.0
8178012,1,B000NIVNKA,"This is labeled ""Intermediate series"" but more than half of this DVD are very advance poses where you have to do freaky contorting moves.  Do not get this if you are looking for intermediate yoga.  I have done yoga for 8 years and don't think i can do most of these poses any time in the next 8 years.",1413417600,,301,4.084745762711864
8178013,5,B000NIVNKA,"I bought it for practicing yoga at home.  It's the best I've ever tried so far.
I had many years of yoga experience practicing with Indian yoga masters.  It is very important to had a basic knowledge and correct knowledge about yoga before you get into any home video practices by yourself.  It can cause serious injury if you don't.
Be very careful.  Know your limit.  Don't ever push your body too hard.",1352419200,,405,4.493150684931507
8178014,4,B000NIVNKA,"I have been a student of Ashtanga for a few years now, and I am a big fan of it.  Ashtanga has without a doubt been a good thing in my life - it improved my health and vitality, and is a great form of yoga.  Richard Freeman is a fantastic yogi and a good teacher.  His calm voice guides you through the asanas as he models them for you perfectly on your television screen.  The setting and camera work are simple and basic, and there is very little music and no flashy video tricks.  But if you are new to yoga or ashtanga, don't start with this video!  Start with the first series, and of course it is better to have a real, live teacher than a video.

This is really closer to an advanced practice than an intermediate one.  Many of the poses were beyond my (admittedly limited) flexibility, and I had to modify them.  But that is perfectly all right (altho Freeman does not address the issue), and I still get a lot out of going thru the series with him.  I am not clear where he got these poses from.  It seems that some teachers are out there creating new Ashtanga serieses on their own - but as long as the teacher is qualified and capable, I don't see why not.  I love the way yoga has grown and developed in America over the last decade or so.

I would like to see the moon series and intermediate series that my teacher (Stephanye Dussud) taught me appear on a video.  I believe she was using the ones developed by Matthew Sweeney, but I'm not 100% sure about that.  Until I see those on video, this will do just fine.  Long live ashtanga!",1317859200,5,1548,4.179054054054054
8178015,5,B000NIVNKA,"My guess is you will pick up this DVD only if you have been practicing the primary series for quite a while. So that means that you are already familiar with the rigor and demands of a regular ashtanga practice. That said, somehow Richard has a very soothing and calm way of giving fairly detailed instructions to all the poses. If you aren't already a regular intermediate series practitioner then you will of course struggle with the poses. In this practice, Richard doesnt really offer variations for the beginner. My suggestion is to use David Swenson's book to find variations, even while practicing to this DVD. Those variations make the intermediate practice accessible to all. Else it may be a little discouraging. I really did love Richard's voice and emphasis on alignment very helpful and look forward to many years of practice with this DVD",1271808000,16,852,4.882758620689655
8178016,5,B000NIVNKA,"I am very glad that I purchased this video. Richard Freeman is a master, not just of Ashtanga yoga, but also of using the most effective words possible to teach this system. If you're learning from a video and don't have the benefit of a local teacher to help you with adjustments, then verbal cues are everything, and Richard Freeman is the man to give them. This is because his word choice is so precise that it truly helps you visualize how to move your body to take your practice to the next level. Being able to watch him demonstrate the postures with grace and ease is also very inspiring. I highly recommend this video if you've been practicing the primary series and are ready to move into second series. It's extremely helpful.",1253836800,23,736,4.541353383458647
8178017,5,B000NIVNKA,"This dvd is intermediate in the ashtanga yoga tradition of six series: Primary, Intermediate, and Advanced A, B, C, and D.

It doesn't mean intermediate as in the next step from beginner. This is an Ashtanga Vinyase Yoga video in the form that is taught by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois.",1145404800,6,278,4.56
