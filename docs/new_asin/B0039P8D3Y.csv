Takes me back many years! To a time of less political correctness, and when adult comedy, meant adult !
Jim Davidson is a great entertainer in this area, full of fun and energy, cast work well together.
Bought this to share with older members of UK family..... Very glad we did !",1387929600,,373,4.485294117647059
8553498,5,B0039P8D3Y,"Had the original of Sinderella Live VHS as a gift from a friend in the UK. Unable to purchase it here in Australia. Unfortunately lost it over a 10 yr period during various house moves. Have been looking for the DVD for ages. Finally found it on Amazon UK. The box set of 3 titles are fantastic. Typical Jim Davidson ""humor"". Laughed my head off at the original Sinderella and the 2 others. Highly recommended for lovers of British ""saucy"" comedy.",1315785600,,447,4.530864197530864
