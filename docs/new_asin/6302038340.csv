419246,4,6302038340,"If you love cheasy movies and collect classic horror movies, get this movie! Rawhead Rex's costume may look cheasy but it's the chease factor that adds to his creepiness. I remember seeing this movie when I was about  ten years old on HBO early in the morning. I remember it was a really hot  night and me, my dad, and my brother were sweating like pigs in the living  room with the fan on high. We watched Rawhead Rex because there was nothing  better on TV. The movie itself is really creepy with the settings and the  most unpredictable site for a massacre: a trailer park! The movie itself is  very much like the old myth of the Golem. Some guy wants to kill of his  enemies, so he creates a monster to control and do his dirty work. Somehow,  ripping off that idea worked. I doubt you can rent this movie anywhere, but  it is worth a watch. Especially on a hot summer night. Fans of Romero  movies and similar horrors that are meant to be scary but provide more  laughs than chills should pick this movie up because it is a definite  underground classic.",960163200,4,1059,4.346938775510204
419247,3,6302038340,"The film starts out with a wonderful premise; a creature sealed beneath a  standing stone thousands of years ago by pagan magic is accidentally revived and returns to it's traditionally celtic habit of collecting head hunting in a small Irish town.  It's an irresistable story for anyone with an interest in Pre-christian mythology and magic. A creature like Rawhead would undoubtedly be  responsible for legends of Trolls and Ogres, and perhaps even the creatures  from the Beowulf legend.

 Unfortunately the film promises much more than it's able to deliver. The Rawhead costume is alright, but the face has an  unfortunately plastic look to it. The acting is acceptible for the most part, with the local inhabitants of the town are sympathetic. Though the films  hero, a vacationing American writer is somewhat less than likeable. It is able to generate some suspese though, and a couple of shots are effectively  chilling, but overall I was never really terrified by the film or the  creature. Though he's still pretty damn nasty, and I'd still hate to meet  something like it in real life!

  I can't help feeling the film might  have been  truly effective in the hands of a more capable director. The  rural Irish locations are lovely, and quite evocative, but are rarely used  to effect in the film. (See The Wicker Man for a movie that gets it right).  The film also seems somewhat rushed, with little time for anything more  than basic character development and story background. Poor visual effects  take the edge off an otherwise interesting final confrontation, as does the  annoyingly 'Hollywood' epilogue.

 Still, in spite of it's obvious flaws, the  primordial power of the story shines through, making it at least worth the price of admission.",958176000,5,1761,4.989655172413793

It has better effects than Frankenstien, but people LOVE that film.  But look past this one.  All you have to do to like this film is pay attenion to the story.  It is true, this film would have been better if they used the 15 piece Rawhead Rex suit(and Barker's orignal script) they intended to use, but it is still pretty scary.  Any true horror fan must see this film.(Also, for more Rawhead Rex facts, read Clive Barker's Shadows in Eden.  I highly recommend it!)",956102400,,595,4.547169811320755

In its present incarnation as a film, its like a bunch of film hack high school kids got together and said, lets make a horror film for the Halloween Holiday.

The mouth could barely even move and with frozen articulation at that. No realism. If this is the kind of cheese you like, then have some crackers with it and enjoy.

419336,4,6302038340,"WARNING SPOILERS! Forget that this film is based on a story by Clive Barker. Forget that Clive Barker disowned this film upon its release. If you can forget these two things you will probably enjoy this unconventional monster-on-the-loose flick with a real nasty streak. An Irish farmer, while trying to remove a stone pillar from his field, accidentally releases the title creature from a long imprisonment. A vacationing photographer (the late David Dukes) and his family try to convince the local authorities that the creature does exist, but to no avail. Meanwhile, while photographing the inside of an old church, Mr. Dukes learns the truth about the legend of RawHead Rex. The police finally believe his story after one of his children is brutally murdered by the creature. What makes this film different from others of its like is the eerie atmospheric photography and general mean-spiritedness. This film is steeped in local Irish color and contains some truly offbeat characters. There's a local priest who wants to help RawHead Rex and is not above murdering people and spewing filthy language. RawHead urinates on the priest while he begs for more! This and many other scenes (including a beheading, a gutting and other gory scenes) deter you from the fact that the story line is very thin. Forget the story (and the rather weak ending featuring some bad optical work) and just feast your eyes on the screen. You'll have a bloody good time (and RawHead Rex is a sight to behold). Director George Pavlou also filmed Barker's story ""UNDERWORLD"", released here as TRANSMUTATIONS (1986). It's a rather boring exercise mixing detectives with monsters. He also directed the crapfest LITTLE DEVILS: THE BIRTH (1993). RAWHEAD REX also stars Kelly Piper, Ronan Wilmot, Niall Toibin and Heinrich von Schellendorf as RawHead. Stay away from the version shown on the SyFy Channel. It's missing most of the violence and the urination scene. David Dukes' last film was the disappointing TV miniseries ROSE RED (2002).

419361,4,6302038340,"BOTTOM LINE: A C level horror movie, trying its best to pass for a B flick. Some great stuff herein, along with some junk, but thats par for the course for a quickly put together low budget film. RR has gone on to garner something of a cult following over the years; mainly, I suspect, due to the fact that decent copies to watch were few & far between. This 4k transfer from the good folks at Kino Lorber is very nice, indeed. Some excellent bonus material, produced specifically for this release, is solid enough to up my rating by a full star. Thus, I give RAWHEAD REX a full 4 STARS.

THE STORY: Farmer in rural Ireland is clearing a field for plowing and foolishly disturbs the runestone which has kept a vile, bestial being in-check beneath it for untold centuries. The monster, known as Rawhead was something of a bloodthirsty pagan gladiator king in his time, thus the sur-title, Rex. Essentially, Rawhead is the unbridled male id given physical form. A vacationing American writer becomes entangled in the story when the creature breaks free and begins ripping the locals to pieces. A local church may hold the mystery to containing and/or destroying the creature but can our Yank hero figure things out and put a stop Rawheads rampage before it slaughters everyone on the emerald isle?

THOUGHTS: I vividly recall catching this first-run in theaters back in 86 or 87. I was excited because it was a new, original-looking monster, rather than just another vampire, alien or whatnot. Much as I was amped for the beautiful grotesqueness of PUMPKINHEAD, the feral, heavy metal-looking title monster in RAWHEAD REX promised something fresh and original. The film itself however, is something of a letdown; due mostly to the difficulty of translating the Clive Barker short story faithfully to the big screen. This film, by necessity of its fast shooting schedule and bargain basement budget, drops the ball at several points throughout the movie. Not a total failure, but certainly not in the same league as the original Barker story. (Something that can be said for many, if not all of Clive Barkers stories that have been adapted for film; and not unlike the difficulties of translating Stephen Kings works.)

The monster design, though far-removed from Barkers original concept, is nonetheless pretty cool and certainly appropriately vicious in appearance. (His mesmerizing sparking red irises are a nice touch.) The suit actor, a sky-scraping 19 year-old German ski instructor (!) with zero acting skills, tries his best, but the breakneck shooting schedule didn't allow for multiple takes in which he could refine his emoting (such as it is) and thus give us a better performance. The other actors are competent, especially for the genre and the budget.  The big snag with RAWHEAD REX would appear to be the editing, which doesnt give the story a very smooth flow, and the choppy pacing makes the overall narrative suffer as a result. Its still lots of fun on a low budget bloody monster on the loose movie level, but in the end this film feels more like a pagan-god version of GRIZZLY than the occult-cool creaturefest that is PUMPKINHEAD. The sad fact was that the RR production actually ran out of money and had to finish the shoot with a mere handful of unpaid crew members just to give it some kind of ending; and the one we get is a stereotypical monster movie finale that weve all seen a zillion times. But hey, at least it has an ending! LOL. After over a decade hacking through legal red tape, director George Pavlou has obtained the complete rights to the film and now owns it outright, which is why were finally getting a legit home release after waiting so many years.  And speaking of which

THE BLU-RAY: Using the original camera negative, the team at Kino Lorber has affected a nice-looking 4k restoration. The result isn't perfect, but its very very good  especially in comparison to the myriad gray market bootlegs and the ages-old VHS tapes and pan&scan DVD formats of the film. The video portion is mostly clean, with only a smattering of dirt & debris throughout. The blacks are solid and the mid-tones are equally firm. Little in the way of artifacting or pixelation, though there IS noticeable crush (video noise) in some of the low light scenes, most notably in the church. The audio is clean and the soundmix is level.

Along with the new 4k scan, Kino has included a strong amount of original bonus content. Theres a full-length directors audio commentary, moderated by Stephen Thrower (author of the outstanding indy horror reference tome, Nightmare USA). Mr. Pavlou is a little fuzzy on many of the finer points, but then again he is recalling details from a film made in a mater of weeks, over 30 years ago. Next up are on-screen interviews with a couple of actors, one with the fellow who wore the Rawhead suit (in German, with English subtitles) and another with the chap who played the church deacon who becomes an unwitting pawn of Rex. On-screen interviews with several of the F/X crew follow, then a chat with comicbook/graphic novel artist Stephen Bissette. Theres a photo gallery with behind-the-scenes stills & concept artwork. The films short theatrical teaser trailer rounds out the extras. A slim essay booklet is packed in the Blu-ray slipcase, whose artwork, by the way, is reversible, with two different promotional posters from the films original theatrical run; plus the plastic slipcase is enclosed inside a cardboard cover that features yet another nice piece of art. All-in-all, this a very very nice hi-def release thats sure to please RAWHEAD REX devotees, 80s slasher/monster lovers and fans of horror in general.",1508630400,,5674,4.860392967942089

Rawhead Rex (1986) is quite a bad film, but I had a blast watching it! I'd definitely recommend this movie to fans of cheesy 1980s horror films. The creature effects are quite laughable, the acting is pretty bad, but I was able to overlook that and just have a ton of fun.

There are some scenes that have some grain but for the most part picture looks clean. It's a good creature feature for horror fans and one that I've been waiting for on blu ray. The price was great. Some in their review mentioned that it was expensive but Amazon actually lowered the price before they shipped it to me. I paid $16 before taxes. Not bad.

419364,4,6302038340,"I don't usually leave reviews for ...well anything. I think they are mostly pointless because when it comes to art/entertainment be it movies, books, video games, etc., it's all relative. What might be great in one person's eyes may be terrible in another's. In the end it really doesn't matter either way and it's a no win argument for both sides.

Anyway, I grew up in the late 70's and throughout the 80's...I was there...and experienced it first hand and NO I'm not looking through a pair of nostalgia glasses. (I'll leave that for the prudes & hipsters who, IMHO, seemingly wish they had grown up during that time even if they won't admit it but ironically hate on it and call everything from that era cheesy, but I digress) You really HAD to be there to understand what all the fuss was about when it comes to the entertainment of the era. I'm not even going to try to explain it to you. You either get it or you don't.

Case in point, RawHeadRex. Cinematic masterpiece? No. Best adaptation of its source material? (Clive Barkers short story of the same name from Books of Blood Vol. 3) Nope. Worst horror/monster film ever? Not even close. If you actually think that...fine, but that leads me to believe you really haven't seen many movies.

I'm not here to sell the film though. You already know if it's something you're interested in or you wouldn't be here, right? The new dvd & bluray from Kino Lorber looks about as good as it ever will I think. It's a step-up from the original vhs and dvd editions that's for sure. It looks better than I thought it would. Sound is solid and it has a decent set of informative extras. Overall an excellent edition and one that is worth the money.

Uh-oh, here comes my opinion! - RawHeadRex is a decent little monster film. It has some cool atmosphere, practical effects, over the top performances and a low budget that bleeds throughout all the proceedings in the best of ways. It's not perfect by a long shot but it does have one thing that is sorely missing in a lot of today's low budget direct to video releases and even major studio blockbusters...FUN!

It's just a fun, goofy, gory romp. Period.

Remember when movies were fun and people didn't take everything so seriously? I do. Nowadays most people act as if you assaulted them personally if it's not the greatest thing ever. It's really sad. I've never seen/read/played a prequel, sequel or inbetwequal that ruined my original experience with anything. If you have, I urge you to re-evaluate your life OR better yet instead of complaining, write a book, write a script, shoot a movie, get into acting, create a video game...be part of the solution instead of just another pointless angry reviewer. We have enough of those pretentious idiots already.

I've rambled enough. Thanks for reading...and if by chance this ticked you off somehow, lighten up!

Cheers.

And quit using the word cheesy. :)",1508371200,50,2903,4.654296875

While I recognize the temptation to dismiss this by the somewhat hokey title (for those unfamiliar with Clive Barker and his source material) and the ""man-in-big-static-looking-rubber-suite"" monster, this is actually quite entertaining and never gets too bogged down or boring. I rather liked the pagan/""ancient gods"" context of the story line and found it to be well acted for the most part (excluding maybe the static-rubber-monster-head presence in some scenes!). Admittedly, the finale was also kinda hokey and maybe looks a bit dated, but i'll take the slightly dated effects over most CGI any day! The movies strengths are in its great location scenery, somewhat unique story premise (released during the Slasher ""hey-day"") and monster with its resultant gore.

419432,3,6302038340,"The worst thing to happen to Ireland since the potato famine, red hair and liver failure.  But like these things, at least this made me smile.

Rawhead Rex is a demon that is released by a curious farmhand and a random lightning strike on his imprisoning monolith in the middle of an Irish countryside. How's that for a random, bad 80s horror premise?  I think we're in for something good here!
Howard and Elaine have come to Ireland with their young children while Howard investigates something for work.  But when folks start dying, Howard is the only one in town who seems to know what they're up againsta death-dealing demon cryptically prophesied in the local church's stained glass windows.

Our demon looks like one of the 80s Evil Dead demons possessed a tall hairless gorilla with an ratty 80s hard rock mullet and glowing red eyes; he reminds me of a coked-up Gene Simmons.  He knocks lots of thing over and breaks stuff between POV shots of chasing his victims.

When Rex claims a member of Howard's family as a victim, it's personal!  Howard finds clues in the church and discovers the pre-Christ origins and weakness of Rawhead Rex.

They really pushed the bad special effects hard, but such a low budget packs very little punch.  We see prophetic visions in the form of video transformed by green prism filters and ""lasers lights"" producing laser-like lightning and laser-lit objects.  The gore is nothing impressive, but at least it's sufficiently frequent later in the movie.  They tried--sort of.

Written by a young Clive Barker (the Hellraiser franchise), this prestigious film illustrates the respectable notion that paganism outranks Christianity in terms of credibility.  The short story on which this movie was based was quite good.  However, the movie itself, boasting a magic rock and a crappy light show that save the day, was not so good.

419438,4,6302038340,"Now a days the reviews have become a little less on the dense side due to an important decision. The elf needed to go back to the roots where it all began, and decide on only reviewing the best B's there are to find. Under these new pretenses we now have to be truly moved by a B very similar to the way we did in the golden years. On that note, if anything screams of B it is a film know as Rawhead Rex. In essence it's an Irish version of Grim. Well that's not fair to say since Rawhead came first...so let's say Grim is the American version of Rawhead Rex. This film has just about everything one needs when looking for some low budget laughs. A nice touch to the horrid acting was the Irish accents, it just made the film seem that much more exotic. This is a film Uncle Shamis and sloppy Joe would have enjoyed with a couple Guinness Stouts and a nice plate of corn beef and cabbage.

Within the first 15 seconds you are eased into the notion you have just stumbled upon some top notch late 80's B. As our main character dives along the Ireland's terrain there is a heavy dose of action movie music, not fitting the mood at all. That's one star right there. Now we spend the next five minutes watching some potato farmers trying to knock over this giant cement pole in the ground that looks like a wang. This is clearly a big mistake as it unleashed Rawhead Rex out of the ground like a torpedo as lighting bolts crash down in the background. Wrong, you forgot the lightning bolt. This Rawhead Rex character was one of the finest creatures ever to grace the silver screen. He has this crazy horse face with bloody teeth and red eyes...and never changes his expression once. It became obvious this head was whipped up with no hopes of looking real. They must have said ""let's just get it done Bobby"" and forged ahead with the lowest of expectations. As the bodies pile up our main character must become the hero and save Ireland from it's greatest foe since liver failure.

Rawhead Rex is just about everything right with a B horror movie. Sure it's horrible, but that's what makes it such a beauty. It's still confusing to find there are people watching something like this expecting a legitimate scare. If you're watching a film called Rawhead Rex one would imagine you know what you're getting into. However everyone is entitled to their opinion and we can appreciate that. There's probably some out there that didn't love Death ring either. A statement like that is near the brink of insanity, but still is probable true. For us Rawhead Rex will become a new classic on the long list of B horror history. It falls right into that great category of late 80's-mid 90's B that really can't be topped. It honestly is almost the exact same movie as Grim except for a couple changes. This is an absolute must see for the true creature feature B lovers out there. The fact that it's selling on here for about a buck sixty proves you couldn't spend your money any wiser.",1327708800,4,2970,4.398181818181818
419439,2,6302038340,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: It was around Halloween back when I was young and working at a video store, and my family came in looking for a monster/horror movie they had never seen.  I had just talked to one of my regulars about horror movies a few days earlier, and he went on, and on, and on about how awesome Rawhead Rex was.  I took his word for it and told my parents about it.  I thought my family was going to wait for me to come home to watch it, but they had just finished it when I arrived, and all I got was blank stares.  They said it was bad, and kind of disgusting.  I watched it, and they were right.  The monster looked great, but the story was eh, and then came the 'peeing on a priest' scene.  The movie is a dumb monster movie... with urination.  There are some scary parts, bur for me, the movie is really not worth a piss unless you are really into monsters that like to rip peoples heads off, piss on priests, and are afraid of pregnant women.

To this day, my parents still bring up how I told them to watch that one movie that I said was so good, and I keep needing to remind them that I had not seen it yet, and that it was one of my customers who said it was good.  Thanks guy!",1319328000,2,1197,3.9707112970711296
419440,2,6302038340,"You wouldn't be far off if you called me a huge fan of Clive Barker. I pretty much love the guy's work whether it's written or being put to film. I loved Midnight Meat Train more than most, I still think Hellraiser is one of the creepiest movies ever, and I always find myself getting lost in whatever Barker book I stumble upon. One of the first books I read by Barker was the Books of Blood Volumes 1-3. There were several stories that stood out, but one of the main ones that has always stuck with me over the years was Rawhead Rex. It's powerful, it's engrossing, and it's considered to be one of Barker's best short stories. So a film version of one of Barker's best should already have enough momentum to at least be decent at the end of the day. Unfortunately that isn't the case. Somehow Rawhead Rex became incredibly lame and plagued by 80's cliches somewhere in between its transition from novel to film.

Did you ever used to watch ""Doug""? The animated series on Nickelodeon with Porkchop, Quail Man, Roger Klotz, Patti Mayonnaise, and Skeeter? There was an episode called Nightmare on Jumbo Street where a horror movie hits the neighborhood where everyone in town sees it and is talking about it, but Doug closes his eyes and misses the ending. He stretches out seeing it again because he's scared, but when he finally gets around to seeing the ending he realizes you can see the zipper on the back of the monster's costume. That's kind of the way Rawhead Rex is except you basically see the metaphorical zipper as soon as Rawhead shows up. He looks terrible. It basically seems like a wrestler running around in a glorified ape costume. The mask looks like it's made of rubber except the facial features twitch occasionally, he's cross-eyed all the time, has two mouths in addition to one of those plastic sets of pecs and abs to make him look ripped, and his fingernails grow and shrink at will. Rawhead Rex basically looks like an ape raided Vernon Wells' leftover Road Warrior outfits and then decapitated and hollowed out the head of George, the King Kong-like character in the 1986 (made in the same year as the film) arcade game Rampage and wore that as a mask. Any of this sounding awesome yet? Oh, it's just getting started.

I'm about to spoil the hell out of this movie mostly because it's out of print and practically impossible to find. Nearly all of Rawhead's kills end in some sort of obviously fake appendage or mannequin being used. Low budget films can be incredible, but it's usually when they're able to hide the fact that they were made so cheap. Rawhead Rex decides to embrace this fact while saying, ""Let's show Rawhead trying to bite this guy's neck even though his mouth doesn't open wide enough, it appears as if he's nibbling on the victim's cheek, and Rawhead looks like he's barfing blood on the guy rather than the blood coming from the victim's flesh wound."" The monster is also territorial, which doesn't sound so bad until his territory is a trailer park. Rawhead not being creative with his kills doesn't really help matters either. It's pretty much all decapitations and claw swipes. One of the more bizarre moments in the film is when Rawhead Rex kills a man at his home and then goes after the man's wife. Rawhead destroys the inside of their home, but spares the woman when he realizes she's pregnant. The monster leaves and a friend of the couple shows up. When the friend finds the wife, he asks if she's alright. The woman clinches her fists and GROWLS at him before pausing for a moment and bursting into tears. That reaction should be used on unwelcome Jehovah's witnesses who come knocking at your door.

The last half of the film is even worse. A magic rock saves the day. It's kept in a glowing red box in the Ireland church. Once the rock is used to help stop the monster, it uses the cheesiest 80's special effects imaginable. ""So if I'm a chick and I lift this rock over my head, I'll have a laser light show right in my own back yard? Righteous!"" The stone makes an appearance in the original story as well, but it's at least used in a way that comes off slightly less ridiculous than a rock that shoots lasers. The film just plays out in the worst of ways. A man tries to save a woman that Rawhead is about to slaughter, but winds up tearing her dress instead and we get our only nudity shot in the film. She bumps into a tree and dies. She's supposed to be thrown, but the impact is about as rough as accidentally bumping into somebody in public. Rawhead Rex is nothing like the source material. I was surprised they kept the vicar's ""baptism"" scene in there.

Rawhead Rex is the type of film that gives horror a bad name; it's cliche, the monster is obviously a man in a rubber suit, it's predictable, and it's basically just meaningless gore. It's like the film tries to throw a little bit of the actual story in there near the end of the film, but it's too little too late. The damage has already been done. Rawhead Rex is pure cheese, but it's not even good cheese. It's like that hunk of cheese you've had in the fridge for a year and a half that's covered in three inch thick green mold. This film is out of print for a reason. Don't hunt it down unless you're a die hard Clive Barker or major horror fan.

He looks like an orc auditioning for Judas Priest. The awkward close-ups of his rubbery hands breaking crockery while he's supposed to be chasing a woman through her home, kind of kill the tension.
Clive Barker's short story is ideal material for an awesomely brutal monster movie. This needs to be remade by a director who really cares about the source material.

I'll ignore the special effects (if you've seen the film and don't remember them, there were some, honest, at a stretch) and just mention on of my favorite scenes.

419518,4,6302038340,"I'm sure in the bottomless realm of B-movies that barely hit production -- much less find their way to DVD -- there are plenty of monster flicks. Yet few truly great (and actually original) monster films seem to be easy to find. Well, congratulations! You've found one! Two years before the amazing film ""Pumpkinhead"" (also available on Amazon), there was another ancient killing machine of a demon-legend, known as ""Rawhead Rex""...

(First of all, just to get it out of the way, there are absolutely no special features on this DVD. And as a matter of fact, the menu itself is the scene access page -- nothing more. Basically, this is a VHS that you don't have to rewind after viewing it.)

The story is a bit predictable: An ancient demon-creature is set loose upon the earth (in a small, country setting) and seeks to slaughter a bunch of locals. One man's son becomes one of the victims, so he takes on the duty of man-to-monster heroism. Throw in some backing story about what exactly the creature is and why it's here and you've got this baby in a nutshell. Rawhead Rex is one of those simple movies where there's not too much to find as far as plot-based details go, so I'll leave any of the big info on the creature for your own discovery. Regardless of the lack of cleverness, you can be assured there is plenty of the creature and it's slaughtering to keep you entertained! Of course, by the end of the film, it's becomes a show-down between the father and the demon. The father has finally discovered what the demon is afraid of, but can he destroy it in time before more humans, including himself, are ripped apart by Rawhead?

The costume of Rawhead Rex is definitely not something to brag about. It looks like a large, ragged barbarian/road warrior with a creature's head. Not to mention, it's mullet-style hair. Take away some of the scarier features from it's face and it could've been in Michael Jackson's Thriller music video. Still, the concept of the creature and it's savagery is what must be focused on, not the cheap rubber suit. This is an Irish film from 1986, so don't be surprised if there is more cheesiness than true horror.

Which brings me to my conclusion of why you should at least rent Rawhead Rex: it's a classic monster flick that is more fun than it is scary. I think if you're the type that enjoys the cornier side of horror movies, then this is perfect for you. So don't waste any time -- witness another tasty, twisted, and fairly original monster flick with Rawhead Rex!",1123286400,7,2511,4.573333333333333
419519,4,6302038340,"Brutal. Gruesome. Chilling. Bloody. Inspiring! Just the way I like it! Everyone should watch this video in the dead of night - especially cross-huggers. This is a horror film with a message. One that they don't want to hear, because it is the truth, & they choose self-denial. After all, for xians, self-deception is bliss.

 Rawhead Rex, a Primally Pagan, pre-xian creature, worshipped, according to the movie, by ancient peoples as a Dark God, the Lord of Death & Savagery. But he is not without his persuasive charms of fascination. Like Dracula, he possesses powers of mental manipulation, to coerce, & set his victims in awe. An ideal balance betwixed mental & physical might. A Satanimal. Besides the hypnosis, Rawhead is a barbarous beast. A monsterous demon of havoc & chaos. The personafication of Abaddon. He goes about the Irish countryside ripping & tearing his preys asunder, & feasting on their still warm bodies.

 The movie is repleat with religious symbolism & folklore. Even upon the stained-glass windows of the church, there lays the Pagan history of the Terrible One. He that was here before the accursed missionaries came. Even the church was built atop a Pagan Templewhich was defaced by monks, but they could never keep this evil down for long. Rawhead bursts from the primal shrine, an obilisk, symbol of fertility & might, onto the earth from below, to horrify the disbelievers, & put them in their low places. ""My death fortells My return!""... That they may hear their own heartbeats, pounding fast, so long as their blood doth flow. That they cherish their breaths, for any one could be their last. They are set to run like deer before hungry roaring lions.

 The typical irresponsibility of mortals without foresight, who constantly ignore the warnings of the wise, until the great calamity is upon them, at which they stare blankly, with stupified bambi-eyes, into the face of their slayer. Thus, they learn in the harshest of ways.

 Rawhead Rex has all the elements that makes a horror show stimulating & entertaining. Fun for the whole family. So fill the air with the sounds of terror & torment... & maybe, if you are fortunate enough, or unfortunate, depending upon the person, or sub-vital, you may attract some of those so-called ""evil spirits"" that the sanctimonious scumbags hack about.

 Don't believe the BS-DP at the end. They put those kinds of ideologically unrealistic endings to prevent people from defecating all over themselves, & again, to preserve them in their little ""happy-sunshiney"" world. Just another pre-determined, pre-programmed, pacifying outcome. The ""meek & the weak will inherit the earth"" type of nonsensical bile.

Here, Rex pops up in the first minute and starts his carnage. Yeah! Only the British could have made this movie. I was astounded when I found out it was made in 1986. It's got the feel of the Hammer films of the 1970's. Stylish, yet aggressive. The claustrophobic atmosphere of a small, isolated Irish village is captured well. Rex may appear to be on a random killing spree, but slowly his motivations and the overall supernatural situation are revealed to us, like a puzzle coming together. Primal forces of nature and supernature are involved here. The latecomer Christianity is powerless to oppose them. I think those of us who haven't read the original story are better off. From the complaints of those who have read the story, it seems they refer to narrative subtleties that just can't be captured on film. Better to acknowledge the limitations of the medium and proceed accordingly. Many complain about the monster suit.

What happened to the devoured Garrow girl (yes, the farmer had a daughter in ""Books of Blood"")? Why didn't Rawhead rip the ""manhood"" off the police captain like he did in the story? What about the pony? Why are Rawhead's lusty inclinations avoided entirely (readers: remember his masturbatory ecstacy in the church after he beats the door down?)? Barker intended Rawhead to be a personification of bestial destruction and appetite from Britain's dark and often celebrated pagan past, but in this lame movie he's reduced to yet another hulking actor in cheap leathers and a latex orc mask. Other changes were also entirely unnecessary...why move the setting from Kent, England to Rathmore, Ireland? Why turn the British real-estate developer hero into an American photographer/writer hero? The acting is bloody awful in this production (especially that of Kelly Piper...pretty, but as an actress about as wooden as they come...her talents would be put to much better use in pornos). The only half way decent actor in the film is the Bryan Ferry look-a-like David Dukes as the leading man. There are trailer parks in Ireland? Jeez, you learn something new every day! I will give the film this much credit, anyway: this is a story about good paganism (the Earth Mother hidden in the ancient altar ""borrowed"" by the Christian church) versus bad paganism (Rawhead), and the movie keeps this message at least, seeing the priests as the nuisance they were meant to be.

There were truly gorey scences (the spray of blood when he bites the priest was very well done), and many scenes of 'implied horror'.  The character development was adequate. I think that the creature was great.  I appreciated what they did with limited resources, and found him satifactorily disgusting, if not terrifiying.

I now own the DVD and, although there are no extras or theatrical trailers to boast of, it does retain a reasonable picture and sound quality. Personally, I like Rawhead's look for this film and have learned to dismiss the nitpicky opinions of others who whine about how artificial he seems to the naked eye with a grain of salt. Pavlou did not obviously have a ""Titanic"" size budget at his disposal and, you have to remember, we were not at the time this was made able to enjoy the same sophistication of CGI as we do today. This is the kind of movie to watch for the sheer fun of it. The characters, especially that of Verger Declan O'Brien and his maniacal mood swings in the church, keep the film alive and enjoyable.

7820251,3,6302038340,"WARNING:  Liquid courage (booze) may be required for you to watch this. The only redeeming quality is, well....Clive Barker. This fiasco of a film was loosely based upon Clive's original creature concept from his Books of blood.  The only reason for this film sucking is because I understand Barker didn't do a hands-on approach like he knows he should have, thus the BIG DIFFERENCE between this and Hellraiser.
 Bad actors.  Bad scenery.  Bad, BAD Rawhead creature look. The best scene was Rawhead pissing all over a priest.  But it's sort of a Clive Barker thing, so I just had to watch.",1521331200,,589,4.782178217821782

The print of movie is a little fuzzy in a few spots but not bad. The movie itself is a good English style horror movie, a little cheesy at times but a good fun movie to watch if you're a fan of these kind of films. A must have for Clive Barker fans.",1520121600,,372,3.6625
