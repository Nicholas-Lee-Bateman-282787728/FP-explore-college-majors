8210311,2,B000TPZIB2,"I wasn't very impressed with this video.  I was looking for dance moves to use in a high school pageant opening number.  If videos would have been around when I was cheering in elementary school, this would have been perfect to learn a half-time routine...for 10 year olds.  But the instructor standing there counting 1-8 all the time without actually performing the move is no help at all.  I ended up using a video that had an instructor who counted and described each move as she performed it.",1213920000,4,496,4.6022727272727275
