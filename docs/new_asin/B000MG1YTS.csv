8168403,4,B000MG1YTS,"Obviously originally made-for-tv (many 'commerical breaks'--which is fine, good 'pause areas' for bathroom or snack breaks). Great production and over TWO HOURS--got my money's worth! Only 4 stars because, frankly, it 'dragged' a bit in certain places--but still, definitely worth the money and lots of good, spooky stories, esp. if you like lighthouses.",1185667200,,354,5.69811320754717
