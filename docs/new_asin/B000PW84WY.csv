8193550,1,B000PW84WY,"This was not a good purchase.  I got the same quality on-line looking at You Tube.  As another reviewer points out, the picture is tiny only about 1/4 of the screen and is not really suitable for showing at a movie night.",1238284800,9,221,4.238095238095238

Low quality, I don't recommend.",1232236800,6,143,5.454545454545454
