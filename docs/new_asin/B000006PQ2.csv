7904958,1,B000006PQ2,"Unfortunately I can't review the program content of this tape because my VCR won't track tapes properly that were recorded in the Super Long Play (SLP) mode. And many other newer VCRs won't track SLP tapes either, no matter how much adjusting is done.

If you're not up to speed (sorry) with the different recording modes, or speeds, here's a quick rundown. When VCRs were first manufactured, maybe the late 70s early 80s, you could record and play back in three speeds, thus being able to fit more recording time on the same amount of tape. A tape recorded at SP (fastest speed) could normally fit two hours on a single tape. At LP (medium speed), that same tape could hold four hours. A tape recorded at SLP or EP (slowest speed) could hold six hours of content.

The trade-off is, the slower the recording, the lower the image and sound quality. Also, the more problems the VCR has with maintaining proper tracking, which keeps the playback heads aligned with the tape surface to avoid video noise and distortion.

Now fast forward (sorry again) to today and if you can find a VCR, it will probably only play back properly if the tape was recorded in the SP mode. Thus, it's very important to know before purchasing a tape, what mode it was recorded in. This information wasn't included in this tape's listing. So now you know.

Hopefully I'll be able to get a refund, but that's off topic.",1369008000,,1393,4.582329317269076
