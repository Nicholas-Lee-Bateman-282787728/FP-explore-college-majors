8581718,3,B00CHAE7KA,"SS Camp 5 is set during the time of the holocaust in WW2. A special camp separates woman who are either used for experiments or are used in an SS brothel. The experiments center around healing burns on the German battlefield.
  The movie is an R-rated (by me) B movie. Full frontal nudity. There is a rape scene that is a little hard to watch. Knowing that this is a movie with actors makes it OK in my book. No one is really hurt. The use of real holocaust pictures at the start and end of the movie was uncomfortable for me because I felt it inappropriate for this kind of movie. All in all the movie is good. The story is a good one and possible for the time and setting of the movie. A real late night drive-in movie. Not a bad movie of adults to watch.",1375228800,,757,4.073825503355705
