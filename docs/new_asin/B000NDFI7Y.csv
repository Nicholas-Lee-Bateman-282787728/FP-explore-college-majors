8176896,5,B000NDFI7Y,"So far I have seen the biographies on Tod Browning, Jack Arnold, Jacques Tourneur and Roland West. I will give you a more in depth review after I finish them and review them a few more times. So far infinity out of infinity.",1339632000,,224,4.232558139534884
8176897,4,B000NDFI7Y,"This is well done collection of interviews of earlier directors and some current directors of horror and SiFi movies.  Where  the principle artist was unavailable a collection of the balance of the crews and producers responsible for many works bring a world of information
to the viewer.  The movie buff will be please with the efforts of John McCarty and Wynn Winberg in bringing all this together.",1273363200,3,400,4.940298507462686
8176898,5,B000NDFI7Y,"Here in Latin America, some chapters of this ""mini TV-series"" were transmitted as stuff by a UFO-Spirits-Atlantis-Pyramids-New_Age goofs cable channel called ""Infinito"". They only aired three chapters: Stuart Gordon, Tobe Hooper and George Romero. After that, repetitions and finally, cancellation.
Also remember, at least until today, the ""visited by over 50 million movie and TV lovers"" IMDb haven't a single byte of info about this series.
For me, this series will be seminal to ""MASTERS OF HORROR"".",1197417600,2,502,5.532467532467533
8176899,3,B000NDFI7Y,"All of these talented filmmakers are more than deserving of having a documentary / featurette dedicated to them. Each doco has a run time of approximately 25mins. This collection from the early 90's obviously was a labour of love, but unfortunately it's a low budget affair. From xeroxed grainy production stills to dark scratchy trailers (that we've all seen a milllion times before - some of them are shown to their full entirety, which only seems to pad out the already short duration which is deserving of more.) This collection is an okay starting point for the uninitiated...and that's about it. To those already savvy to the films and filmmakers that are looking for more - you'll be disappointed and bored. The only exception was the Roland West episode, a filmmaker that hasn't been in the spotlight as much as the others featured here. Details like behind the scenes stories on some of the classic films and ancedotes from the actors and production crews would have made these doco's a lot more interesting. For those wanting to learn a basic knowledge on some of the great independent auteurs, then this collection offers that - but no more.",1185580800,5,1152,4.852791878172589
