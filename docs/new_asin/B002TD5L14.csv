8380086,5,B002TD5L14,"This video is three long flights, Toronto to Japan and back (3 hours), plus to Germany (30 minutes), in the 777-300.

You get excellent coverage of the pre-flight, of in flight procedure, and of the instrumentation.  This video is worth it just for that.  There is less scenery than in many of these, but it does have some excellent aircraft exteriors and we spend some time in the cabin.  There are also views through the external cameras of the engines during flight, which are one of a kind.

Three things to look for, one good:  the crossing of the international dateline is well explained and its interesting to see the aircraft adjust its instruments (the good), (the not so good)  the pilot violates the ""sterile cockpit"" principle by talking about unrelated matters during the descent, which is noticeable when compared to other videos, and he sort of makes fun of the ground crew in Japan.

All in all, a well made and interesting video that belongs in your collection.",1333238400,,978,4.745562130177515
8380087,4,B002TD5L14,"This is a very interesting video from the cockpit. Pilots explain the 777's systems easy to understand. Oceanic procedures are shown as well. I'm very impressed with the capabilities of the Boeing 777-300ER. Crew members made a good job showing their tasks. Althought this video was shot with a single camera, they did a nice work. If you're an aviation enthusiast and a Boeing 777 fan, this is a 'must have'.",1282694400,,409,4.774647887323944
8380088,5,B002TD5L14,"I highly recommend this video, great information from the flight deck and interesting to see how the overwater flights take place.",1270857600,3,130,5.238095238095238
