3098315,5,B0012RWQJ8,"If you like the 80's and like Andrew McCarthy than Mannequin is for you. He, as usual, plays a lovable schlub who comes across a magical mannequin that comes to life just for him. This helps him create amazing window displays for a department store he works for and causes a rival store to jealously plot  how to lure him over or stop him completely.

Mannequin 2 isn't as good but its entertaining enough. The male lead is much weaker in this movie but a young Kristy Swanson makes up for it.",1520294400,,493,4.3478260869565215

3098325,4,B0012RWQJ8,"A silly/unbelievable story but it was entertaining. The second one wasn't very good however.
I'm giving this a four star rating as we really only wanted the first one but it was cheaper to get both then just one.
I would probably give it 2-3 stars but my wife loves it so it gets 4.",1516320000,,282,4.1454545454545455

3098327,1,B0012RWQJ8,"20th Century fox have reissued MANNEQUIN again this time with its sequel Mannequin 2, it's 2 Disc set
which is not even worth watching, mannequin 2 is on the list of the worst sequels ever
the 1987 Mannequin reissued has the same content as the original 2004 dvd release
it's a recycle of the 2004 dvd version the film is in the same 1:85:1 ratio with same dolby digital stereo but no extras of course
not even the original Trailer has been added this time, pathetic effort by century fox no Doubt about it
Mannequin 2 is the same 1:85:1 ratio but no extras not even the original Trailer
so if you can still buy the original as a single Disc dvd then get it, this Double Disc set isn't worth $1
this 2 disc set is that bad that i gave it 1 star, half a star each Disc
Olive films have also reissued Mannequin on blu-ray but tragically it's no better
Olive films did clean up the picture quality with new 1:85:1 HD transfer & new sound mix 2.0 master mix
but tragically no extras, not even a new interview with Kim cattrall & Andrew mcCarthy",1515542400,,1040,4.257575757575758

3098369,4,B0012RWQJ8,"The original Mannequin movie with Andrew McCarthy & Kim Cattrall is a classic!  Hollywood & the security guard are hilarious as well.  The sequel however does not live up to the original, especially since the main characters were played by different actors & the storyline was lacking the humor & charm of the 1st movie.",1487548800,,320,4.8

3098393,3,B0012RWQJ8,"Ancient Egyptian comes back to life (travels?) to modern day US and lands of all places in Philadelphia as a mannequin when people are looking and as a hot blooded woman when the down-on-his-luck male sales clerk is looking. They have roll around in the department store hay at night being chased by the night guard. There is a subplot revolving around shady business practices from some people on the board of directors of the store who want to practically run it out of business so they can sell it cheaply to a bigger store in town.

You can definitely see how drastically America has changed in the movie. It was how things USED to be. I mean you used to be able to get a job in a dept store and make somewhat of a living. They were not ""jobs American don't want to do"". And this included Philadelphia when it had a downtown that was halfway typical American. But don't be fooled. The rude terms used to describe the gay window designer were rude back then. They might have been more widely used back then but they were still rude and not used in business.

I like the idea of putting your all into things and turning things around theme. But over all the movie was a dud. It was kinda weird all over. Don't know how to explain it. It just was. And Andrew McCarthy's male blond moments didn't help much. Also having him in love with his mannequin before it came to life was a little creepy too.",1475539200,,1398,4.3320610687022905

3098446,5,B0012RWQJ8,These are both fun cheesy 80's movies. I like both but I actually like part 2 the best. It's over the top cheesy fun. The acting in both movies is pretty good. They are in no way perfect and if you are looking for smart comedies stay away from these. But if you want to enjoy a fun solid comedy with a happy ending these are for you. I love that Hollywood is in both movies. It ties the 2 movies together nicely. I highly recommend this set for anyone who just needs a feel good cheesy movie to have fun with.,1441670400,,509,4.0

The sound quality is lacking.  I had to lower the volume every time a song played, then bring it back up every time a character spoke.  One disc has an image printed on it and the other doesn't.  Were they leftover stock from two separate releases?  We'll never know.  There are no extra features (not that there have to be any, but in this day and age you sort of expect them).

The second is...cute, but clearly trying to capitalize on something that can't be repeated. The first Mannequin makes this purchase worthwhile, and the price is far better than just trying to get the first one alone (but if you're on this page then you already know that).

Like most kids who watched entirely too much television, i grew up watching Mannequin repeatedly on HBO. It was always on and always watchable. Good, clean fun is what it is. Even with Kim Cattrall playing an Egyptian princess, it's enjoyable if not entirely accurate (it's the 80s, and you get what you get.) Even all these years later though, I find that the first Mannequin holds up well. It's a cute 80s rom-com. There's a chase, because there's always a chase, and hilarious supporting actors.

And Mannequin 2? It is what it is. Meh.",1406505600,,908,4.70440251572327

--MANNEQUIN--
Mannequin, released in 1987, stars Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall as Jonathon and Emmy. Jonathon is a would-be artist who finds himself getting fired from dead-end job after job. Originally, he is working building mannequins and, after spending too much time on each one, especially his most recent one he seems to have taken quite a liking to, is fired. His luck finally changes when he inadvertently saves the life of the owner of a local large department store. The same one he just happens to spot this last mannequin in, the one he liked so much.

After getting an entry-level job by one of the movie's antagonists, the store manager, Jonathon meets Hollywood who, when you really think about it, is probably almost every gay stereotype in the book. But it never comes across as insulting and Hollywood is easily one of the best and funniest characters in the two movies.

Emmy grew up in BC Egypt (as probably one of the whitest Egyptians I've ever seen) but wanted to be more out off life. It just so happens the Egyptian gods grants her wish and she ultimately she ends up becoming (possessing?) Jonathon's mannequin in the present day. It works out that only when Jonathon is around can Emmy become a normal person. Otherwise she's trapped as a mannequin.

Throwing in the mix is the manager/owner of the main rival department store who wants to ""steal"" Jonathon due to his mannequin and art abilities sending the store's profits through the roof.

-----MANNEQUIN ON THE MOVE-------

Mannequin 2, released in 1991 has little connection to the first movie, other than featuring the same department store and Hollywood and a brief and passing reference. This time, the main character is Jason, played by William Ragsdale, who has just gotten a job at the store.

This time, the ""mannequin"" is Jessie, played Kristy Swanson, a young peasant girl from 1,000 years ago. 1,000 years prior, she and a prince were in love and were planning on marrying, something his mother disapproved of. So much she had a sorcerer place her under a curse that turned her into a mannequin. Officially, she gets turned to stone, but the ""stone"" is a very mannequin-like piece of stone, I'd say. The curse goes that she can only be freed by her true love in a foreign land after a 1,000 years have passed.

Present day, Jason gets a job working directly under Hollywood, from the first movie. It so happens the store is getting ready for a presentation of the ""Peasant Girl"", essentially Jessie and the curse has become a legend. The descendant of the sorcerer and three bodyguards are taking the ""statue"" on tour and the store is the first location. As fate would have it, Jason turns out to be her true love and once the necklace is removed, Jessie becomes human again. In the process, Jason must stop the sorcerer from stealing her away.

----

Plot summaries out of the way, personally as much as I enjoyed both movies, I thought the first movie was better. It just seemed less....silly than On the Move. The acting in both movies were fun if not over the top in certain cases. I thought On The Move was a tad bit sillier in nature with the sorcerer's grandson and the three dimwitted bodyguards.

I will give On the Move one thing though. I did think that William Ragsdale and Kristy Swanson had better chemistry as a couple than Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall did, though they weren't bad at all.

If you're looking for simple movies to just have fun watching, these two movies would be a good choice to pick up. Just don't expect",1340668800,,3799,4.6537313432835825

Though the movie is just a comedy which does not require too much brain to watch, I love the creative window case the the ideas of all actions which put the story together.  I am especially found of the character Hollywood Montrose and his various sun glasses.  Personally I preferthe first one because its originality.  The story are entirely different in the two movies.  The songs are wonderful.  It is such a pleasure to watch them and feel good afterward.  I wish there were a thrid one.  Over more than ten years and my likeness for the movie has not change a bit.

It was a huge hit, and has been played often since by the children. My sister who remembered it fondly from the 80s was thrilled and delighted to have it and see it again.

Though the music was never released in an album, I have found copies of the sung songs online. I only with they had the instrumentals availble too, for they were particularly wonderful.

Mannequin was an enjoyable light hearted film and highlights the gorgeous Kim Cattrall, and teen heartthrob (at the time) Andrew Macarthy.

Highlight is the gay window dresser ""Hollywood"" who is played over the top, but brilliantly by Meshach Taylor, he also reprises his role in II.

It interesting to see early role of James Spader as the slimy Mr Richards, and GW Bailey (Rizzo from MASH) as the store security ""commandant"".

Not a classic but fun and enjoyable none the less.",1219622400,,557,4.904255319148936

3098675,4,B0012RWQJ8,"Well, I guess it depends on which movie you're looking for as to the review.  I've called the review ""half & half"", because I REALLY liked one movie and really DIDN'T like the other.

I've always liked MANNEQUIN, ever since it came out.  I love Kim Catrall as an actress, and I especially like her performance in this movie.  Sure, it's a 'slapstick'-type of comedy, and an 80's one at that, but the charm is still there after all these years.  The other characters' performances are less-than-perfect, but you have to remember when this movie came out.

As for MANNEQUIN 2: ON THE MOVE, I can't say much POSITIVE about this one.  It really has NOTHING in common with the first movie, except for the title (the concept is completely different), and the performances are completely inept.  I basically figured: ""Oh well, I got it for free with MANNEQUIN"", and so I didn't figure I wasted my money (if I had paid extra money for it, I'd have felt ripped-off).",1216080000,,957,4.588235294117647

I love the original Mannequin film for its campiness and, of course, Kim Cattrall!  However, the second movie really needs to be attached to the first before anyone in their right mind would watch, or purchase, it.

All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase because the good aspect of having Mannequin on DVD outweighs the bad aspect of having Mannequin 2 on DVD.",1215734400,,483,4.465909090909091

This helps him create amazing window displays for a department store he works for and causes a rival store to jealously plot  how to lure him over or stop him completely.

Mannequin 2 isn't as good but its entertaining enough. The male lead is much weaker in this movie but a young Kristy Swanson makes up for it.",1520294400,,493,4.3478260869565215

which is not even worth watching, mannequin 2 is on the list of the worst sequels ever
the 1987 Mannequin reissued has the same content as the original 2004 dvd release
it's a recycle of the 2004 dvd version the film is in the same 1:85:1 ratio with same dolby digital stereo but no extras of course
not even the original Trailer has been added this time, pathetic effort by century fox no Doubt about it
Mannequin 2 is the same 1:85:1 ratio but no extras not even the original Trailer
so if you can still buy the original as a single Disc dvd then get it, this Double Disc set isn't worth $1
this 2 disc set is that bad that i gave it 1 star, half a star each Disc
Olive films have also reissued Mannequin on blu-ray but tragically it's no better

3332890,3,B0012RWQJ8,"Ancient Egyptian comes back to life (travels?) to modern day US and lands of all places in Philadelphia as a mannequin when people are looking and as a hot blooded woman when the down-on-his-luck male sales clerk is looking. They have roll around in the department store hay at night being chased by the night guard. There is a subplot revolving around shady business practices from some people on the board of directors of the store who want to practically run it out of business so they can sell it cheaply to a bigger store in town.

You can definitely see how drastically America has changed in the movie. It was how things USED to be. I mean you used to be able to get a job in a dept store and make somewhat of a living. They were not ""jobs American don't want to do"". And this included Philadelphia when it had a downtown that was halfway typical American. But don't be fooled. The rude terms used to describe the gay window designer were rude back then. They might have been more widely used back then but they were still rude and not used in business.

I like the idea of putting your all into things and turning things around theme. But over all the movie was a dud. It was kinda weird all over. Don't know how to explain it. It just was. And Andrew McCarthy's male blond moments didn't help much. Also having him in love with his mannequin before it came to life was a little creepy too.",1475539200,,1398,4.3320610687022905

The sound quality is lacking.  I had to lower the volume every time a song played, then bring it back up every time a character spoke.  One disc has an image printed on it and the other doesn't.  Were they leftover stock from two separate releases?  We'll never know.  There are no extra features (not that there have to be any, but in this day and age you sort of expect them).

3333065,4,B0012RWQJ8,"Like anyone with a decent taste in movies, I love the first Mannequin and tolerate the second. The second is...cute, but clearly trying to capitalize on something that can't be repeated. The first Mannequin makes this purchase worthwhile, and the price is far better than just trying to get the first one alone (but if you're on this page then you already know that).

Like most kids who watched entirely too much television, i grew up watching Mannequin repeatedly on HBO. It was always on and always watchable. Good, clean fun is what it is. Even with Kim Cattrall playing an Egyptian princess, it's enjoyable if not entirely accurate (it's the 80s, and you get what you get.) Even all these years later though, I find that the first Mannequin holds up well. It's a cute 80s rom-com. There's a chase, because there's always a chase, and hilarious supporting actors.

And Mannequin 2? It is what it is. Meh.",1406505600,,908,4.70440251572327

--MANNEQUIN--
Mannequin, released in 1987, stars Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall as Jonathon and Emmy. Jonathon is a would-be artist who finds himself getting fired from dead-end job after job. Originally, he is working building mannequins and, after spending too much time on each one, especially his most recent one he seems to have taken quite a liking to, is fired. His luck finally changes when he inadvertently saves the life of the owner of a local large department store. The same one he just happens to spot this last mannequin in, the one he liked so much.

After getting an entry-level job by one of the movie's antagonists, the store manager, Jonathon meets Hollywood who, when you really think about it, is probably almost every gay stereotype in the book. But it never comes across as insulting and Hollywood is easily one of the best and funniest characters in the two movies.

Emmy grew up in BC Egypt (as probably one of the whitest Egyptians I've ever seen) but wanted to be more out off life. It just so happens the Egyptian gods grants her wish and she ultimately she ends up becoming (possessing?) Jonathon's mannequin in the present day. It works out that only when Jonathon is around can Emmy become a normal person. Otherwise she's trapped as a mannequin.

Throwing in the mix is the manager/owner of the main rival department store who wants to ""steal"" Jonathon due to his mannequin and art abilities sending the store's profits through the roof.

-----MANNEQUIN ON THE MOVE-------

Mannequin 2, released in 1991 has little connection to the first movie, other than featuring the same department store and Hollywood and a brief and passing reference. This time, the main character is Jason, played by William Ragsdale, who has just gotten a job at the store.

This time, the ""mannequin"" is Jessie, played Kristy Swanson, a young peasant girl from 1,000 years ago. 1,000 years prior, she and a prince were in love and were planning on marrying, something his mother disapproved of. So much she had a sorcerer place her under a curse that turned her into a mannequin. Officially, she gets turned to stone, but the ""stone"" is a very mannequin-like piece of stone, I'd say. The curse goes that she can only be freed by her true love in a foreign land after a 1,000 years have passed.

Present day, Jason gets a job working directly under Hollywood, from the first movie. It so happens the store is getting ready for a presentation of the ""Peasant Girl"", essentially Jessie and the curse has become a legend. The descendant of the sorcerer and three bodyguards are taking the ""statue"" on tour and the store is the first location. As fate would have it, Jason turns out to be her true love and once the necklace is removed, Jessie becomes human again. In the process, Jason must stop the sorcerer from stealing her away.

----

Plot summaries out of the way, personally as much as I enjoyed both movies, I thought the first movie was better. It just seemed less....silly than On the Move. The acting in both movies were fun if not over the top in certain cases. I thought On The Move was a tad bit sillier in nature with the sorcerer's grandson and the three dimwitted bodyguards.

I will give On the Move one thing though. I did think that William Ragsdale and Kristy Swanson had better chemistry as a couple than Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall did, though they weren't bad at all.

If you're looking for simple movies to just have fun watching, these two movies would be a good choice to pick up. Just don't expect",1340668800,,3799,4.6537313432835825

3333169,4,B0012RWQJ8,"These videos brought back fond memories (the first one more than the second).
Mannequin was an enjoyable light hearted film and highlights the gorgeous Kim Cattrall, and teen heartthrob (at the time) Andrew Macarthy.

Highlight is the gay window dresser ""Hollywood"" who is played over the top, but brilliantly by Meshach Taylor, he also reprises his role in II.

It interesting to see early role of James Spader as the slimy Mr Richards, and GW Bailey (Rizzo from MASH) as the store security ""commandant"".

Not a classic but fun and enjoyable none the less.",1219622400,,557,4.904255319148936
3333170,5,B0012RWQJ8,I'm glad I was able to get them both on DVD at once. This is one movie that I grew up watching and will watch over and over again!,1219622400,,130,3.5172413793103448
3333171,4,B0012RWQJ8,"I was waiting for Mannequin 2 to come on DVD, when I saw this I thought great.

Brings back memories.

Great movie's.",1216252800,,117,4.2727272727272725
3333172,4,B0012RWQJ8,"Well, I guess it depends on which movie you're looking for as to the review.  I've called the review ""half & half"", because I REALLY liked one movie and really DIDN'T like the other.

I've always liked MANNEQUIN, ever since it came out.  I love Kim Catrall as an actress, and I especially like her performance in this movie.  Sure, it's a 'slapstick'-type of comedy, and an 80's one at that, but the charm is still there after all these years.  The other characters' performances are less-than-perfect, but you have to remember when this movie came out.

As for MANNEQUIN 2: ON THE MOVE, I can't say much POSITIVE about this one.  It really has NOTHING in common with the first movie, except for the title (the concept is completely different), and the performances are completely inept.  I basically figured: ""Oh well, I got it for free with MANNEQUIN"", and so I didn't figure I wasted my money (if I had paid extra money for it, I'd have felt ripped-off).",1216080000,,957,4.588235294117647
3333173,3,B0012RWQJ8,"I would give this product 5 stars if it were not for Mannequin 2: On the Move being part of this particular collection.  I love the original Mannequin film for its campiness and, of course, Kim Cattrall!  However, the second movie really needs to be attached to the first before anyone in their right mind would watch, or purchase, it.

All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase because the good aspect of having Mannequin on DVD outweighs the bad aspect of having Mannequin 2 on DVD.",1215734400,,483,4.465909090909091
3333174,5,B0012RWQJ8,"Just what I ordered. First dvd had a crack in the middle if the disk, but played just fine, no problem!",1215475200,,103,3.9523809523809526
3333175,4,B0012RWQJ8,"I remember watching these movies as a kid. They are great for nostalgia. They are both rather cheesy. The second one being much more cheesy even than the first. BUT they are definitely worth it for the price. You can't beat 2 decent movies for this price... So, if you are a child / teen of the eighties... or just want to be... then these movies are for you.",1213574400,,359,4.217391304347826
3333176,4,B0012RWQJ8,This is a great combination. This is one of the few movies where the sequel is as good as the first.,1210291200,,100,3.8095238095238093
3333177,4,B0012RWQJ8,"I am very pleased with my purchase. The movie is awesome and not mention hard to find normally, so i was extemely happy to see this two for one deal pop up when it did. The service from amazon was great....I never have problems with them. so overall...this was a great purchase.",1210204800,,278,4.365384615384615
3333178,1,B0012RWQJ8,I loved these movies 5 stars for movies down to 1 star for no closed captioning when are companies going to realize many of us can not hear well especially with the music tracks so loud you would think that they could separate the music tract from the audio so that you could adjust the music lower I like the music but find that it overpowers the dialogue needless to say I am upset and that I will not buy this DVD,1205193600,,416,4.085365853658536
