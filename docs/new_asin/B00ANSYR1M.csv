8554882,5,B00ANSYR1M,"I love crazy far out movies. And this one fits the bill. It's not for kids because of the blood and killing.  It is weird, but I love this kind of stuff. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel one day and have been searching for it. I am so glad I found it. If you like Vampires, this is the one you must see. Its not just about killing vampires, it has a story line too, that in my opinion is well played out.",1393891200,,410,3.7674418604651163
8554883,3,B00ANSYR1M,"This film aired  July 14, 2012  (SyFy) under the title ""True Bloodthirst"" and was filmed in Bulgaria. The movie takes place in the near future. Humans have known about vampires for ten years and they co-exist with vampires forced to live in Sector 5 of the city. They feed off of synthetic blood and the occasional black market offerings. A super vampire appears that feeds off both vampire and human blood. Humans and vampires must join forces in order to kill this mutant breed.

Johnny Harker (Andrew Lee Potts) is an expert vampire killer who has been in jail for two years. He is recruited to go after this new breed and assembles his team which include his eye candy sister (Heida Reed) and girlfriend (Claudia Bassols). Two straight cops go along with him giving the film the feel of ""Beverly Hill Cop"" plus ""48 Hours"" with vampires...but it wasn't that good.

It seems both vampires and vampire hunters hang out at Ravs. Mercury bullets can kill vampires. People willingly turn into vampires to avoid death.

The plot sounds really good. Andrew Lee Potts does a good job as our colorful lead. Unfortunately the rest of the cast is unconvincing and uninteresting no matter how short their skirt or how well they can dance on a table. The special effects were acceptable as were the sets. The script had lame dialog, except for Harker, and he wasn't large enough to carry the film.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.  Walmart $9.96.",1389916800,2,1448,4.722222222222222
