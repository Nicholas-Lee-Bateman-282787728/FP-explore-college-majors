8523196,1,B007YZ2QME,"This item was listed as all region, however it was not. I was not able to play the DVD and I had to send it back. I paid for an item that was falsely advertised. I requested a refund because of this, but did not receive one. I sent the item back and I'm still out of the money I paid for it along with the return postage - which was more than the item itself. Very dissatisfied.",1393200000,,378,3.858974358974359
