8582490,4,B00CJFWSKY,What wonderful memories of watching this in the 1970's . The topics are still fresh today and will delight viewers with it's subject matter. Thought provoking for sure.,1430870400,,168,5.035714285714286
8582491,5,B00CJFWSKY,"I watched this with my sisters as a small child and was excited to find the episodes available.  It really is a great show, with much of the information still relevant after all these years.  Leonard Nimoy is a fantastic host and (with his passing) I hope these vintage shows get air time one again- it would be a fitting tribute to a great actor, narrator and host!",1429142400,,366,4.367647058823529
8582492,5,B00CJFWSKY,"Although this is an older show, you can still learn alot from these episodes.",1427846400,,77,4.571428571428571
8582493,5,B00CJFWSKY,I could not afford the entire collection but at the least season four dvd's contains most of my favorite episodes. The Amityville horror episode is very creepy and was shot on location at the real house not a fake set. This makes this set worth buying even if the other episodes may not to your liking which I doubt considering the other episodes are superb.,1402012800,,358,4.523076923076923
8582494,5,B00CJFWSKY,Great 70s show would not be as good without Nimoy. Early precursor to Monster Quest. It has held up well.,1399507200,,105,4.3
