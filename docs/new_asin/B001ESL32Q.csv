8299454,1,B001ESL32Q,This DVD was formated on some other kind of DVD system other than what we use in the U.S.  I contacted the seller and there was never a response. I never saw this opening ceremony and wanted a copy. Also I wanted to use it with my Special Ed. students to reinforce the curriculum on China. VERY DISAPPOINTED.,1294617600,2,308,4.310344827586207
8299455,1,B001ESL32Q,"well NBC should be taken to court for false advertisement. firstly the actual running time is NOT as stated on the box 4 hours but 3 hrs. 25 min. that is not a MINOR error.
second the full opening is N shown. we do get the ultimately boring march of nations, which quite frankly I could have done with out or maybe 10 min of that would suffice, but why have that in lieu of the FULL and awesome opening acts. it is a shame and a rip off.
So title is false too, it is NOT the full opening.
I would say tech quality of DVD is excellent.",1224720000,3,534,3.908256880733945

8299457,2,B001ESL32Q,"Have I missed something here? Why this set is so heavenly priced??

No commentaries at all. Not a well-done set, even at $12.",1219708800,2,125,4.434782608695652
