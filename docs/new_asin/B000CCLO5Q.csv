8325872,5,B000CCLO5Q,"The standard parallel themes make up this movie. First a FBI agent must go undercover in the Miss United States beauty pageant to prevent a mad bomber from bombing the event. The second theme is the ""ugly duckling"" who realizes her potential.
You have seen this type of movie before and can anticipate most of the twists and turns, even the outcome. What you can not anticipate is the fun you have on the way. All the actors are well chosen for their parts. I am not going to describe them as you as I do not want you to be anticipating them. In fact it is best not to look at the actor list until they show up on the screen (It's a shocker.)
After watching the movie the DVD had all the elements that DVDs promise to have. There are bios on the actors. Most of all is a running commentary, which rivals the movie for top billing. Actually I thought Sandra was cute in her clumsy stage. Her commentary showed the differences they made cosmetically and psychologically to advance her through the movie. There is a funny disquisition of using graphics to mask a certain object on Sandra.
This may be one of Sandra's best. It is sure worth watching.",1501459200,,1146,4.384976525821596
8325873,4,B000CCLO5Q,"This silly little romp has become a bit of a classic in its own way and, since a visiting friend had never seen it, we had a quick look on Amazon and found it bundled with the sequel, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.  Two days later we were sitting down to watch it again in DVD splendour.

The storyline is well known and basically a combination of many classic themes: Cinderella, the Ugly Duckling, role reversal, the tough cop with the heart of gold, a small woman proving herself in a male-dominated milieu, a sceptic reassessing her preconceptions.  A cacophony of clichs, but as everyone knows, clichs work because they are true to life.  The attempt to make beauty contests seem less shallow and sexist than they really are is half-hearted and it only pays lip service to the cause, which is just as well because anything heavier would get in the way of the humour.

Sandra Bullock is one of my favourite contemporary actresses and in this she establishes her full acting range:  she is funny, screwed up, self-mocking, committed, moving, and physically impressive in her athletic scope (I know she had a stunt double, but in many scenes she does the punching and kicking herself).  The other pageant contestants, unfortunately, are mediocre  at best in both acting ability and looks (that part, at least, is true to life).

Michael Caine waltzes through a typically brilliant performance and Candice Bergen is convincing in her role.  The real surprise for me was William Shatner, who provided some of the funniest moments just by cringing or delivering a killer line with perfect timing.  I didn't know he had it in him.

My idea of entertainment is light-hearted comedy with a feel-good factor.  I'm glad we bought this DVD because, old as it is, it's still worth watching in preference to some of the depressing dross that passes for movies at the moment.",1454889600,,1875,4.785714285714286
