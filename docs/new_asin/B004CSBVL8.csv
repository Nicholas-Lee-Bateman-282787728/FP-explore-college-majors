8423558,5,B004CSBVL8,"This is one of the best music videos every produced!  I grew up more of a Beatles and Stones fan, but when I first heard Cat Stevens singing ""Where Do The Children Play?"" I quickly became a huge fan.  There's a portion of the video in which Yusuf is sitting on a couch - just he and his guitar and plays a few of the songs that made me love him.  Fantastic!",1397520000,,357,3.9305555555555554
8423559,5,B004CSBVL8,"This concert seems as if a musical bridge from the sixties Cat Stevens to the new millenium Yusef Islam.  Eschewed from his glorious pop roots by both his self-imposed more than one exiles and a post-9/11 world the artist emerges once more in the more neutral country of Australia.  What we get is a mature re-emergence of one of pop's great writers/artists.  Though he glosses over some of his fantastic sixties pop gems, they're here and they still speak volumes of grandeur, they get a very simplistic reading that seems as if downplayed too much.

Filimed beautifully with fantastic backdrops Yusef takes the viewer on a musical journey.  Expanding on the aborted ""opera"" of Monnshadow Yusef finally gets to string the story of ""Stormy"" weaving songs, some hits while others not so well known, into more of what his vision originally intended.  This alone is worth more than words can say as to the insight of Cat Steven's musical vision.  While he alludes to his transformation into the Muslim faith he never expounds on it remaining somewhat enigmatic in his journey for enlightenment.  Yet, the songs transcends any particular religious view in their uniform excellence.  Some have felt he should have used the platform to express his obvious sadness of the fundamentalist Muslim penchant for terrorism the viewer should look deeper into what the music says.  The music in it's simplistic beauty and truth does in fact condemn terrorism as any kind of reasonable solution.  Leave your politics at the door and put your love of life first and foremost is what this music purveys.

This is a glorious concert by one of pop music's unsung masters.  It's time for both the UK and the US to take back the music that is Cat Stevens.  This concert is a bridge to the absolutely fantastic musical legacy that the artist has given us.  Please seek this out as I know it isn't easy to acquire, it is simply a musical treasure revisited on a high level indeed.",1367020800,3,1956,4.779761904761905
8423560,4,B004CSBVL8,"I have the Magicat Tour (1976) DVD and I always wished for its release on Bluray. This is not as good (but is close) regarding the song selection.
35 years latter Cat Stevens doesn't look or sound the same (It's hard to find a visual hint of the young Cat Stevens in this mature Muslim man) but the quality of the images and the excellent sound plus a decent selection of songs, including the great extras, more than makes up for the long wait.
If you're a fan, don't miss it.",1320624000,5,476,4.241758241758242
8423561,4,B004CSBVL8,"I bought a copy of this BD from blowitoutahere (Amazon Marketplace). The BD that arrived was labeled region B 1080i. US players play only region A discs. My player set up for region B 1080i BDs refused to play this BD, however. My US region A Panasonic player gave me sound but no picture on my Panasonic 3D 50"" plasma. My 10"" portable Panasonic BD player yielded both picture and sound, but blowitoutahere admitted the BD was ""defective"" and issued a return label so I returned it, having watched it once on the 10"" screen. (I suspect the picture output was 50Hz rather than the usual US 60Hz. My panel will not display a 50Hz signal, and I cannot force the region A player to output an NTSC/60Hz signal.) Proceed with caution.

The performance by Yusuf (Cat Stevens) is excellent, beginning with Lillywhite. His voice sounds unchanged, both in warmth and range. He is accompanied by a single guitarist at first, then by a full band. He performs a very old song (I Love My Dog) as well as some old and new songs. Yusuf then sings and tells a musical story sequence he calls ""Moonshadow"" -- with his illustrations projected onto the screen behind him -- about a boy named Stormy on a planet which does not feel the warmth of the sun. He repurposes old songs (like Matthew & Son) for this musical story and sings old and new ones, but not the song Moonshadow itself, which he performs later.

There is no track listing on the box except for the encores which are played individually. Yusuf's costume changes from number to number, making me wonder whether the content was sourced from several performances. However it is not distracting. In addition to the band there is a woman singing back-up on some numbers and she is excellent. The whole performance is worthy of enjoying many times. If you can play the BD.",1302998400,9,1811,4.58641975308642
