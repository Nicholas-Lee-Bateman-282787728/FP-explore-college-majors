4312999,5,B004B3AHDC,"A very interesting film showing the difficulties one has when he is hearing impaired especially those around him who do not fully understand these difficulties.  It was made difficult by the father, I guess, because he would like to have a 'normal' son. The teacher, also, found it difficult simply because she had no experience in dealing with students like Captain Johnno. Because of them and others except for his friend Tony, the Italian fisherman, Captain Johnno found it extremely difficult and so there is only one thing he can do to escape all of this. Through this the citizens of this small Australian town finally learned their lesson, that because of one's handicap they must adapt themselves to it but most importantly they must accept it whether they like it or not.",1453852800,,780,4.864661654135339
4313000,4,B004B3AHDC,"Great movie about a lonely boy I'd lated because of hearing loss and the abandoned boat and sea he loves, and the immigrant who befriends him.",1447977600,,142,4.5
4313001,5,B004B3AHDC,"This is one of those movies that came up at random while I was browsing other videos, so I was totally blown away at how good it was!

Set in small fishing community in 1950's Australia, excellent cinematography and superb acting brings this charming story to life. I loved this movie!

Note: the leading actor is an Australian named John Waters  not the American actor/director John Waters.",1447545600,,391,4.8059701492537314

4313003,3,B004B3AHDC,"This movie is about a deaf boy finding his way though life, especially during puberty. His search to manhood while being raise with a single mother, causes him some confusion. I thought it was well done, but note, it is hard to understand the main character, the deaf young man.",1378425600,,278,4.58
4313004,5,B004B3AHDC,"Two sides of the same story.
Johnno is trying to find his place in a coastal village of Australia.
Others have difficulties to understand, if not to accept, this boy with hearing problems.
It takes drastic solutions for the community to realize that communication may not be easy: it takes some efforts from both side.",1373500800,,318,4.8
4313005,4,B004B3AHDC,"I was surprised at the very high production values for what is a fairly low budget film.  The acting was excellent, the characters well developed, and the plot engrossing (although it got off to a slow start).  The main theme concerns the relationship between a deaf boy, his family, and the other characters in his life.  The boy is bullied in school; his sister leaves home to go to boarding school; his father is given to angry outbursts at his son's rebellious behavior; and all of these factors ignite a fire of frustration, anger and resentment in the boy that leads him to run away from home to a desert island not far from the shore of South Australia where he lives.  Early in the film, he meets an Italian immigrant who befriends the boy and forms a special bond with him owing to their shared sense of isolation and loneliness.  It is the close friendship between them that enables this man to confront the boy finally about his self-centered attitude, which is making him and everyone around him miserable.  What I so appreciated about the film was its positive message.  In a very moving way, it shows how pride and self-pity can poison relationships between people, but also, how those same relationships can be healed when humility and caring replace self-centeredness.  With all the trash produced by Hollywood these days, it is refreshing to watch this Australian film that has such a positive and uplifting message.",1352332800,3,1433,4.77327935222672
4313006,5,B004B3AHDC,Great film! Again I recommend it for all ages. One of the better Aussie c.f.f. Films. Boys with hearing trouble will appreciate it in particular.,1331856000,,145,4.84

8421395,5,B004B3AHDC,"Set in 1954, this is the story of a young deaf boy growing up in a seaside village in Australia. He struggles with his disability, is bullied at school, and has a cold and distant father. The lad befriends an Italian fisherman and they form an immediate bond because people, for different reasons, have trouble understanding and communicating with both of them. When his sister, with whom he is very close, goes away to school, Johnno feels even more isolated. A riveting and touching saga then unfolds.",1520899200,,503,4.793103448275862

8421397,5,B004B3AHDC,That a spurned Italian immigrat fisherman becomes the bridge between a spurned son and his unhearing father is close to archetypal. I recommend this with five stars because I cannot give it more then 5,1504396800,,201,4.771428571428571

8421402,5,B004B3AHDC,This movie reminds me about another movie with a deaf boy called Dear Frankie. The little deaf boy in this Australian movie was very charming. I know that in keeping with the year 1953 that the hearing aid was in two parts. One the larger part looked like a pocket radio and then there was the ear piece. I did not even mind the fact that the boy did not talk coherently. A person needs full hearing to correct their speech habits. This movie is very charming and I loved it.,1464393600,,475,4.230769230769231
