8348543,5,B00196K8VU,"As a new film maker, the tutorials were very helpful and gave me a sense of hope that I will be able to do my film the same or similar way.  Was very surprised to see how real the green screening and compositing effects looked.  I loved how rain was added to the otherwise dry scenes.  Definitely recommend this to other filmmakers.",1215475200,,332,4.32258064516129

I'm glad I did, because this is a nicely produced video.  I'm very satisfied.  I'm looking forward to watching and applying the tutorials to my future works.",1215388800,,319,4.431034482758621
