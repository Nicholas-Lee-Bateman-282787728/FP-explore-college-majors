3417847,4,B0018O3MLQ,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He uses a trainer in the winter.  He liked it so well he purchased two others.,1263686400,,127,4.04
3417848,5,B0018O3MLQ,"Beautiful scenery and I get a great workout.  I play my own tunes because the classical music is a bit slow and is not as motivating for me.  There is no coaching but I am able to challenge myself so that is not an issue.  I have Bike-O-Vision's Grand Canyon/Sedona AZ, Zion Nat Park/So Utah & California Coast which are all over 74 minutes.  I am very happy with all the DVD's and would recommend them.",1241740800,5,403,4.2631578947368425
3417849,5,B0018O3MLQ,"You'll have the best seat in the house; on your bike riding through beautiful Sedona, AZ.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and this virtual cycling ride makes you feel like you are actually there. I like to put on my own music and then cycle, allowing the spectacular scenery and changing terrain to provide additional motivation.  I've found that alternating this and other Bike-O-Vision DVDs with training and competition DVDs like Troy Jacobson's Spinervals (especially Iron Girl Spinerval), provides the best results and helps to keep my workouts motivating and varied.",1232496000,3,580,5.362637362637362
3417850,4,B0018O3MLQ,"For some reason, I expected the shots to be from inside the Grand Canyon, rather from the road surrounding it. It makes sense that the shots would be from the road, since that is where I would be riding. The viewer is literally in the front seat of a car driving roads in these locations. My only complaint is that the camera work is all from the dashboard. When riding, you glance all around, at the roadway and to far off vistas as well. On this tape, the far off views are cut in, not like you are turning your head. The cuts also keep you from finding a landmark and progressing towards it.

8270235,4,B0018O3MLQ,It is  very pretty pedaling thru the area of grand canyon. It makes time fly.,1470441600,,77,4.133333333333334
8270236,2,B0018O3MLQ,the views don't changes that much and the ride is somewhat slow.  i wouldn't view it again,1424908800,,90,4.294117647058823
8270237,5,B0018O3MLQ,I have been to this region and loved it then.  This brings back good memories and saw many things that I did not see in person.,1401753600,,127,3.8846153846153846
8270238,2,B0018O3MLQ,"NO BIKES IN VIDE4O SEEM LIKE CAMERA MOUNTED TO A CAR,SPEED DID NOT SEEM LIKE BIKE SPEED.WHEN THERE ARE BIKES IN VIDEO IT HELP YOU GET A FEEL OF WHAT SPEED TO KEEP UP TO.THIS VIDEO ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A DASH CAM AND NO COMMENTARY",1383436800,,226,4.044444444444444
8270239,1,B0018O3MLQ,"I already responded to this.  It was horrible. It was a camera on the hood of a car going down the road.  It was stupid.  There are bike trails in the grand canyon and in sedona.  I have been there.  There are even roads through these areas that you can drive through.  You don't have to stay on the main road.  I would not tell anyone to get this dvd.  I still haven't looked at the Europian sampler, but I have a feeling it's just as awful.",1367539200,,442,4.0
8270240,3,B0018O3MLQ,"Nice color, clear scenery to much highway.  I wanted to scenery to actually take me away so that I would realize I was inside on a stationary bike.",1361836800,,147,4.25
8270241,1,B0018O3MLQ,I thought this would be an interactive ride but was saddened to hear boring music and watch a boring video.,1299110400,,107,4.4
8270242,5,B0018O3MLQ,The video is ok I bought for my husband to watch while riding inside during the winter months. Enjoyed the scenery.,1298851200,,115,4.523809523809524
8270243,3,B0018O3MLQ,"This DVD needs some serious editing. It is obvious that this was filmed from an automobile's dashcam and the driver is never passed even on the 45mph stretches of highway. It doesn't matter if the material was shot on film or digitally, it could be slowed down on uphill parts and speeded up on downhills just to make it seem a little more realistic. The Grand Canyon it one of my favorite places on earth so the photography was enjoyable for me but it does begin to feel a bit like being a hamster on a wheel. I won't be buying any more from this series.",1297987200,,555,4.245283018867925
8270244,4,B0018O3MLQ,"The Sedona views are nice but the Grand Canyon views are just okay, I have been there several times and I was wondering how they were going to capture the beauty of the canyon. Did not get it, long roads with no scenes, which is what it is like when you drive through the park. That's okay I can remember what it looked like. Nice try...",1279497600,,337,4.121212121212121
