5165645,4,B008HUSFJ8,I'm really hoping the company who put this season out does the same for all the rest of the seasons. I would certainly purchase them all.,1357430400,,137,4.3076923076923075

I sure appreciated that because I found them in the last minutes and it came in plenty of time for me to gift my husband for Christmas :).  Thanks again!!!",1356566400,,260,4.375
5165648,5,B008HUSFJ8,This season is worth to see it and Ricardo's character gets married and also his true love dies  within days after they get married.,1356393600,,132,4.5
5165649,5,B008HUSFJ8,I loved this series when it was on TV and I am THRILLED that it has finally come out on DVD!!  They are shows that you can watch with your family/kids.  Each story has a moral/lesson and each is entertaining--the humor between Tatoo and Roarke stands the test of time.  ...I enjoy re-watching them as well.  Would recommend to anyone.  Hoping Season 4 comes out very soon as well as the rest of the seasons!!,1355356800,9,408,4.386666666666667
5165650,5,B008HUSFJ8,"The season gets off to a bland, lumbering start, but by the 6th show things begin to pickup.  The 7th show is perhaps the grandest episode of the first three seasons: ""The Wedding"" (5+); it is a followup of Season 2's ""Return"" episode.  The woman, whom Roarke fell in love with, returns to marry him.  Gorgeous scenery, beautiful lilting music, and tear-producing emotional tugs. . . .

Many Fantasy Island shows open with some silly sub-story about the diminutive Tattoo.  By season 3, the writers ran out of ideas.  By the 8th show, these were dropped, with the exception of the 12th show where Tattoo has disguised himself as a fire hydrant. . . .

Many stories have a touch of magic.  As a guest, Mr. Roarke may provide you with a magic potion to rewind your years, to slough off your pounds, to unleash your alter ego, to restore your eyesight, or to instill you with telekinetic power.  Or, perhaps, he may send you back to 1918 to be a flying ace, to the 1860's to romance your ""Gone With the Wind"" heartthrobs, to the first century BC to romance Mark Antony as Cleopatra, or to an era of manly cavemen.  Or, perhaps, he may provide you with a magic ring: its crystal foretells your future.  Or, perhaps, he may arrange an encounter with a mythical mermaid or a love goddess.  Or, perhaps, he may help you prevent an ancient evil spirit from taking possession of your body, or help you conquer your alter ego possessed dummy by instilling life in it so that you can confront it directly and banish it forever.  Or, perhaps, he may just help you crossover to the ethereal other side. . . .

5165651,5,B008HUSFJ8,Fantasy Island season 3 is due to be released at the end of October 2012 by Shout Factory. On the Shout Factory website season 3 is only $29.99 so hopefully Amazon will match their price. All Fantasy Island fans should be emailing Shout Factory to thank them for bringing this series back after Sony made us wait 7 years after releasing season 1. We should also be encouraging Shout Factory to release the remaining seasons 4-7. If they know that there is a market for this then they will release them as they now own the rights. I was one of the people that encouraged Shout Factory to acquire & release this series with recommendation emails so they do listen to the fans/consumers of this show.,1347062400,4,697,4.5396825396825395
5165652,5,B008HUSFJ8,"I was sure after so much time had passed that we would never get more of this fabulous classic 70's show, and I am thrilled beyond words that more of these shows are being released. Season 3 is as good as 1 and 2, even better because I thought I would never see the rest of the episodes. I don't know how long it ran but I want it all, as individual seasons (I canot usually afford ""complete series"" sets, I have to pace my ""luxury"" or ""entertainment"" expenditures so a season at a time if great for me.  I am also happy it is not half a season because as much as I love a show, if I feel I am being purposely ripped off, I am less likely to buy them until someone sells it second hand or it goes on sale for half price. You can only squeeze me so much, and for most of us, the squueze is already happening in life necessities like food and gas and income so not being ripped off by hald a season is fabulous -not to mention the space taken up my a full season is the same as a half season and nobody wants more STUFF taking up more space than necessary.

The great thing about these old shows is they are mostly ""family friendly"" and cross-generational. Before Grandma passed, she would watch my Love Boat DVD's with my mom late at night when visiting, my sister and I watch the old shows because they have great memories, and my nieces are getting old enough to love them and don't even think they are cheesy. It's amazing how adult they were for the time and yet they aren't anywhere as adult as some of the current shows that are specifically made for kids and especially tweens these days.

Thanks to everyone in volved in the release of all these old shows and to everyone else like me who is buying them and helping them continue to get released.

Funny episodes, great characters, mysteries, scary episodes, romance episodes....its never ending in Fantasy Island land!",1342656000,5,1876,4.290960451977401

5165729,3,B008HUSFJ8,"You will disagree with me if you're a hardcore Fantasy Island fan.  But nearly all the episodes of the Third Season seem to be written in a very sketchy and campy manner.

The best episodes include two with Hugh O'Brian and Peter Graves.  Both are on the 3rd disc.  Otherwise, the rest of the season are quite disposable.

If your sole reason for buying this set is to feel nostalgia, you'll feel it.  But you may not be able to help realizing how silly some of the screenplays really are.  The second season is more bearable.

Nothing beats the first season's  balance of seriousness and humor.",1390348800,,595,4.537735849056604
5165730,5,B008HUSFJ8,"Fantasy Island Season Three begin in slow fashion with the first several episodes, however by episode # 6, things begin to improve.  It is episode # 7 which is titled ""The Wedding"", that the series hits a grand slam home run.  This episode, which is a rare single guest episode, is a sequel to the Season Two episode # 8 titled ""The Return"".  This episode # 7 was definitely the best episode of Season Three and one of the best of the entire series.  The episode begins with Mr. Roarke greeting Helena Marsh, who is his great love and has returned to Fantasy Island to marry Mr. Roarke.  Helena Marsh is played by the beautiful Samantha Eggar.  This episode moves ""Fantasy Island "" from farcical to serious entertainment in one giant step with this sensitive and sad story.  As the wedding preparations begin, we find that Helena is dying and after she marries Mr. Roarke, they move to their special part of the island for the remaining days of her life.  At very near the end of the episode, Helena dies touchingly in Mr. Roarke's arms and the episode also ends touchingly with Helena's funeral which is full of the love they felt for her.  The performances by both Samantha Eggar and Ricardo Montalban were superb and sensitive and the episode was well written.

This episode # 7 by itself makes this DVD set worth the selling price, and there are many more good episodes in the set.  I very strongly recommend this DVD set for those who love great entertainment.",1383609600,3,1465,4.574712643678161
5165731,5,B008HUSFJ8,"It is what it is- Cheesy!  But great fun for the hubby and I to indulge in some nostalgia with great scenery and a glass of wine (or Tropical Drink)!  Enjoy!  Great quality recordings, and quickly delivered.",1382227200,,207,4.54054054054054

5165751,5,B008HUSFJ8,"If you grow tired of the technology-laden, 3D animated, music-video modeled fare that passes for prime-time Television today, perhaps you miss the single or double-story-lined days of Fantasy Island.  I get that this isn't for everyone. I get that initial DVD releases failed to reach sufficient market demand. I get that not everyone will want to watch this somewhat dated cavalcade of stars. But I also get it. I like it. Some evenings, I just turn back the clock and enjoy this simple (perhaps simplistic) show from my childhood.",1368748800,,532,4.977528089887641

Unfortunately, they've only got (3) season's available on dvd right now, but I think they were on t.v. for seven season's.
