5315360,5,B009CHRX7K,"So I missed some subtleties about this film because I watched it in Korea and naturally subbed Korean when they spoke Chinese and nothing when they spoke Korean.  But this film is, for the most part, in English.  The actress is from China and speaks English really well.  She was the lead actress in Ang Lee's Lust, Caution, so some of you might know her.  The actor is Korean and spoke English in a believable accent considering his character.  That is to say, you won't have any problem understanding him, but he doesn't speak 100% accurately (many Koreans criticised him for this).

The plot is not the typical love story.  They don't fall in love with first sight (or at least she doesn't), they don't act all clingy and they're doomed from the start (after all, she is an inmate).  It's a serious film, but you don't leave feeling overly depressed.  Actually, I've been waiting for this to come out in the States and I'm super excited about this.  If you're interested in Korean cinema, this is definitely a good one.

8539569,5,B009CHRX7K,"In the opening scene, we see a young woman, Anna (played by Tang Wei) in a brown skirt, stumbling as she walks outside a house complex. She looks as though she is dimly conscious with a touch a delirium in her clumsy stance. The grey sky is unmistakably that of Seattle in late autumn, but the scenery captured has a dreamy haze that feels somewhat unrealistic. With the camera sliding ever so slowly and steadily, her image gradually comes into focus. Soon we get to learn what might just have happened; beaten and bruised all over her face, she appears terrified and frustrated. She then turns around and starts running toward her house. When she rushes into the house she finds her husband lying dead on the floor.

These are the first few minutes of Director Kim Tae Yongs Late Autumn, a somber, moody romantic tale set in the urban landscapes. The sequence (shot on a long track) sets the tone and premise of the film vividly enough, but if you are an average moviegoer expecting a high drama with a conventional storytelling you might be baffled rather than pleased with what follows in the next 110 min.

For throughout much of the films course Kim relies heavily on Tang Wei's silent acting and her facial expressions substituting much of the dialogue with the visual elements. The director also makes a good use of the Korean actor Hyunbin, who is playing the opposite male character most handsomely and agreeably, eliciting awkward but timely body language from him to punctuate with Tang Weis movements. By today's standard, the pacing is slow and sometimes dangerously comes to a stall, but it's completely in harmony with the mood and atmosphere Kim sets out to create. As for the plot, it has a few genuinely creative moments and pleasant surprises, such as when Anna confesses her dark past in Chinese; although the man does not understand what she is saying he acknowledges her with occasional good or bad, the only two Chinese words he picked up somewhere before.

From the purely cinematic perspective, this is a bold filmmaking at its modest best. Film is, after all, a visual art and Kim seems to be fully aware of the strength and limitation of his medium. There are moments abound in Late Autumn in which the two characters scarcely exchange a conversation, but merely staring into each other, through the window, or into the sky. And when they ever speak, they do so in two or three different languages! Yet the film works beautifully because Anna's pain and agony are visually and brilliantly conveyed in Tang Wei's quiet, subtly passionate acting.

While I was watching Late Autumn, time and again I was reminded of films of David Lean who more or less applied the same technique in his films. In a typical David Lean epic, e.g., 'Dr. Zhivago' or 'Ryan's Daughter', its profoundest message is carried not by the dialogue but by the images and by juxtaposing them in a manner that maximizes the visual impact.

One potential risk with this approach is that the audience might think they are only watching the actors walking or moving through the beautiful historical or - in this case - striking urban backdrops without an engaging storytelling to cling to. That is, it might give them a false impression that the movie provides nothing but the empty theatrics. That Kim took such a risk and the bold act of following the footsteps of these old masters is something to treasure and give a compliment for.

The film also confirms that Tang Wei is one of our finest actresses acting today; no other actor can possibly match her intelligence and skill in portraying the quiet yet thunderous passion hidden in her silent look and stare. Unforgettable as she is, Tang Wei looks gorgeous and (dare I say?) cute in Kims directing. The same thing goes to Hyunbin, whose exemplary constraint and the suave, masculine charm shine in many scenes of the film.

'Late Autumn' unfailingly reminds us that it's a grim thing to go through the life crisis as painful as Anna's. But shouldnt we be thankful that there are a couple of gorgeous human beings still around us in this world, giving us much pleasure and comfort? In this sense, watching the film was both a touching and blessing experience.",1454803200,,4207,4.746922024623803

8539574,5,B009CHRX7K,"I saw this DVD last week and almost a week later, this film is still in my head. Granted I don't see many flicks a year (I'm picky), so any film I watch, I usually try to get a heads-up before checking it out. I was intrigued by this film b/c last week I read in Asian rags that the Chinese actress here, Tang Wei, and the film's Korean director, Kim Tae-Yun, announced their engagement. I also saw clips of the highly appealing Korean actor Hyun Bin (sporting a masculine ""stubble"" look), so I finally decided to check it out. Am I glad I did.

From the opening scene to the final shot of Tang Wei, this film unwinds gradually like a flower shedding its pedals. The sometimes deliberate slow pacing forces the viewer to concentrate on the two lead characters. Some folks on Amazon have lodged criticism about the two leads' somewhat shaky English, but it never deters the story. My BF saw the movie with me and was in tears when the final credits rolled.  He didn't even read every subtitle on screen to understand the plot.

The story involves two strangers who meet on a bus and unexpectedly fall in love. But it is not immediate and takes almost the entire length of the film for them to realize their feelings for each other, especially Tang Wei's character. During the course of their encounter, each confronts their own past: One is running away from it while the other faces it -- both unsuccessfully.

Much kudos goes to actress Tang Wei, who maintains her character's sad intensity (her role here swept several awards in Korea). Tender, wistful scenes give a glimpse into her vulnerable psyche and delicate human condition as she battles a tragic past. Hyun Bin is a gorgeous specimen and certainly EZ on the eyes. His roguish look here trounces his ""pretty boy"" roles on Korean TV. But it is his sensitive portrayal of the caddish and somewhat goofy Hoon that wins over the audience.  By film's end, both folks evolve and grow from their encounter. Fate finally catches up to them and lends an unexpected twist.

By half way thru the film, you can't help but cheer for these characters to hook up and sail off into the sunset. Both are lonely human beings longing to connect, and connect they do on a deep emotional level. But this is one film where the characters' past very much dictate their future. The film doesn't quite end where the viewer expects, which adds to its appeal.

The setting of Seattle is PERFECT for this movie. The city's foggy, misty weather appropriately sets the mood for this love story. When the sun finally breaks out at one point in the movie, it also symbolizes a sunny turn in the relationship, but does it last? The highlight comes just at the halfway point when the two sit in their bumper cars in an abandoned amusement park (don't ask me why) and watch another couple from afar. Here director Kim shows his real stuff by making this scene almost mystical in the way it unfolds. It's the film's most magical, romantic scene.

Thankfully, there are no car chases here, no bombs or explosions, no 4-D special effects or aliens falling from the sky (lol)......It's a tender, wistful story directed with a sensitive hand by Kim Tae-Yun and acted beautifully by two highly  appealing actors. When the film reaches its compelling conclusion, it will leave you pondering. I still can't stop thinking about it.

My BF keeps asking me: ""You really let those characters get to you, didn't you?"" Yeah, I did because the film made me CARE about what happens to them. How many movies can do THAT to you these days?? Get this film and savor its appeal time and again. I certainly will.",1405814400,7,3616,4.5922480620155035
8539575,5,B009CHRX7K,"This movie ended much too soon! More of the story is desired. Hyun Bin has never been more enigmatic, and pleasing to the eye, and in character. I love this man more every day. Great Movie and story.",1397001600,4,199,4.2631578947368425
8539576,5,B009CHRX7K,"I'm a new Hyun Bin fan, and I'm American of anglo heritage (which means I'm not a Korean speaker).  So, I was very excited when I learned he'd done this movie mostly as an English speaker.  The movie has a typical grayness that you see in so many Seattle based films.  The production crews filming there can't help themselves but match the weather in cinematographic atmosphere, but it also works for the story, which has an overlay of regret and sadness.  I will say there is a little bit of a surprise turn in the plot at the end.  The movie's sadness is like a lot of small cuts, but there's big slice at the end that I didn't expect.  My version of the DVD did not have complete English translation of the Korean parts, so there may have been some foreshadowing of the ending that I missed.  All in all, (and my Hyun Bin admiration aside), I really liked this movie.  Tang Wei is excellent, as well.",1394323200,7,903,4.333333333333333
