7452191,5,B015UE84EY,"The best video of early Queen you will see. Spectacularly filmed with perfect sound to match. The 5.1 surround is excellent...as is the set list. It is somewhat abbreviated as this was done as a one hour special for the BBC but it showcases the high quality of early Queen material. A must have if for no reason other than to wash away the images of Freddie as such an extroverted, intolerable homosexual in the eighties...Once they were great.",1448755200,5,444,4.632911392405063

7452193,5,B015UE84EY,Early Queen fans will love this. Hope there are more concerts from the early years. You will complain about the quality of the video and the set list if you know Queen  only as a top 40 band.,1448150400,9,191,4.026315789473684

7452196,5,B015UE84EY,"Great News! Being a life-long fan of Freddie and the Dreamers (only kidding) QUEEN I had to review this concert. Long before the group became famous my 2 best listens were and still are, KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE & LIAR. I have many concerts on disc and saw them over 3 times in the 70's at MSG and the Philly Spectrum and I can't recall  these 2 songs being playED' as close to their album ""QUEEN"" as here. Please, do yourself a favor and skip the 3 songs in Japan. They're awful with a capital A'. It made me appreciate the main show that much more. It's not a long concert but if you like early QUEEN, this shouldn't disappoint you. Whether it's Freddie's voice, wardrobe or stage presence it's all here. Sit back and enjoy one of the greatest voices and bands in Rock n' Roll History in their early years. Now if someone could get Eagle Rock to obtain (if available) and release a ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Concert from Elton's 70's Tour I'd be REAL happy.  PS: If you are a baby boomer or had older siblings it's time to get up and ""Do the Freddie"".  Here's a ""SHOUT OUT"" to all you Freddie and the Dreamers.",1447977600,19,1108,4.291866028708134
7452197,5,B015UE84EY,Queen A Night At The Odeon is a fantastic document of Queen in their prime. Great sound & picture highlight this concert. The brand new interview with Brian & Roger is excellent. If love early Queen then you'll love this DVD.,1447977600,7,225,4.512195121951219
7452198,5,B015UE84EY,"I have 2 copies of this show in bootleg form and always pined for the day it would get a proper release. This show is amazing, as with all of Queen's live output. They are coiled ready to shoot and they take the paint off the walls with this gig. The stand out tracks for my are Ogre Battler and Liar, which Dr. may rips through in the solo and proves that Queen could jam and take a song to an entire new level. Roger and John and are locked in and powerful and what can I say about Mr. Mercury that has not been said before, he has the crowd in his hands, commanding and teasing them and giving his all. The young rockers should get this and see how a band creates peaks and valleys in their show. Also, LOL notice, NO CELL PHONES!!!!! Everyone is watching the show with their own 2 eyes and not through and lens. :-)",1447027200,32,819,4.061728395061729

7452203,5,B015UE84EY,"I first saw QUEEN during their DAY AT THE RACES tour in San Francisco at the Winterland Arena.  What a great show.  THIN LIZZY opened and Gary Moore was still on guitar.  Queen was one of the greatest ""live"" bands you would ever see.  I always preferred their early stuff to their later stuff.  I really like their first 3 albums and  don't really like anything past JAZZ so I just love this Blu-ray.  Freddie Mercury is still very much missed to this day.  Long live Freddie.  Long live QUEEN !!!",1491004800,3,497,4.373626373626373

7452211,4,B015UE84EY,Amazing audio and video.  No idea why the set list is almost identical to the Rainbow show a year before.  You'd think they would have supported 'Night At The Opera' more....but this is still great.,1476662400,,198,4.628571428571429

7452215,5,B015UE84EY,"This is from a TV broadcast back in the 1970s. Although the picture qualty has been cleaned up, this is still only DVD qualty video. In other words, don't pay extra for the Blu-ray.  That said, the picture quality is still very good and the sound quality is excetional. Great 5.1 mix.",1468540800,,284,4.461538461538462
7452216,5,B015UE84EY,"What a treat for a Queen fan from the 1970s. This was the band firing on all cylinders ready to break into the big time and begin filling stadiums. So awesome seeing Mr. Mercury taking control of the stage with vocal prowess that has yet to be matched, and amazing to see how talented a keyboard player he was. Brian May's guitar playing never ceases to amaze, and his solo during Brighton Rock brings down the house. John Deacon's bass guitar lays down a solid low frequency foundation, very under rated. And my hero Roger Taylor is an amazingly talented drummer and vocalist / songwriter keeping time and throwing around some tasty fills. Video and audio quality restoration well done by Eagle Rock. Great bonus material and mini documentary with Roger and Brian.",1467849600,3,765,4.7593984962406015
7452217,4,B015UE84EY,"Good show. Surprisingly good image and sound for its age. With minimal difference in the set lists, if you have Rainbow '74 I'm not sure you need this. That's my only gripe. If you love Queen you simply need this.",1464480000,,213,4.35

7452222,4,B015UE84EY,I enjoy this DVD very much it's the first time I've seen in a long time early queen quite a few numbers from Queen's first album from queen two it was a record for TV thus it is a very short just a little over an hour that would be my only complaint,1459987200,,249,3.7169811320754715
7452223,4,B015UE84EY,"1975 Queen and older Queen songs.  Overall quality is fine.  VHS video quality.  The sound is a little muddy but typical for the vintage.  Video and sound are in sync,  Editing is fine.  The main video is 1 hour long.  There are 45 minutes of extras (performances and modern interviews).  A lot of the video is dark, foggy, and lit by spotlights.  If you remember lots of long hair, this video is for you!  I prefer later Queen performances.",1458518400,,441,4.468354430379747

This is Queen when Queen was rock royalty, wow, openers Now Im Here and Ogre Battle will blow yr hair back man!  This is right after Sheer Heart Attack was released and they experimented Bohemian Rhapsody during the show but its a teaser so don't get all giddy for that, instead focus on whats happening now which is the Queen/Queen II/Sheer Heart Attack attack!  Its a breath of fresh air from Rock Montreal 79 and Live Aid 85, its straight up classic, diehards and purists will love this setlist, if yr a 'We Will Rock You' Queen fan this is alot to digest, its epic!",1457395200,3,686,4.310077519379845

Impressive performance,  is visually striking see Freddie in those years already become an amazing frontman. But how well it sing it is beyond words !!. The show is simply magical, with a powerful and (hungry of glory) band. Just after seeing this wonder i stood with my mouth open for a long, long while.

I am biased as ""Queen at Wembley"" is the finest concert video available. No, not the finest ""Queen"" video, the finest rock concert video available; superbly edited and choreographed, Freddie is magical, Brian outstanding, Roger as well and Johnny top flight.

7452246,5,B015UE84EY,"Great concert. I love the guitar sound and Freddie's amazing vocal performance throughout this concert. It's mixed for DVD with audience in rear speakers however occasionally the guitar moves around the speakers wildly. The songs reflect the early 1970s era of Queen which I prefer.

8734678,4,B015UE84EY,"Plus side: it's Queen! You get to hear AND see them! Negative side: this was shot on video for a TV special so the picture quality is pretty poor, and unlike ""Queen Live from The Rainbow '74"" which as recorded to multipack tape the audio is what it is. The ""Rainbow '74"" Blu_Ray also suffers from grainy video but the mix more than saves it. I think the band was a little tighter on that show as well--not leagues better, just more energetic. Still, it's fantastic to be able to see and hear Queen at a transitional point in their career, on the cusp of becoming on of the biggest acts in the World (and quite deservedly in my opinion) and Freddie evolving into one the best frontman ever.
