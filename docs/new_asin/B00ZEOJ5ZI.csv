8720013,5,B00ZEOJ5ZI,This is amazing I got this as a gift and I was so happy that each member got their own photo book my bias is BAEKHYUN and those pictures of him were so adorable. The concert looks so much fun I wished I could have been their.,1455926400,,225,3.8085106382978724
8720014,5,B00ZEOJ5ZI,"I have no other words. This was amazing. The performances are stunning! I only have two problems with this product and it's nothing to do with the distributor or packaging. It's that there are no English subtitles and that Lu's parts are completely skipped over. No joke, he appears for maybe four minutes out of the whole DVD and that's including the group shots during performances. I know this was during his leaving but I'm so disappointed with that. Still, definitely recommend. And I hope they plan to do one for the NA EXO'LUXION as well!",1452470400,,545,4.6875
8720015,4,B00ZEOJ5ZI,"Over all the concert was great and I loved the photo books, but when I opened it two of the cd's were not in their right place and when I played one of the cd's throughout the concert it started to freeze because it got scratched. Also you should know it does not come with a Luhan's photo book and he's in the concert, but they completely avoided him. There is no close up whatsoever when he sings. Honestly I got annoyed a bit because you could see him, but the editing of the concert was made to seem like he wasn't there. Luhan was one of my favorite members so it bothered me. Also Kris in not in the concert because he had already left, just in case you wanted to know.",1446422400,2,675,4.082706766917293
