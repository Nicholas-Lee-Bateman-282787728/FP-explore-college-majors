8172657,5,B000MV8JFK,"This DVD gives visual ""answers"" to questions about the Bible I didn't think to ask, but should have. I highly recommend buying this.

Example: We read in the Bible that Jesus and the disciples went to Caesara Phillipi...why is that place mentioned? there is a huge rock, a pagan site of worship when Jesus was alive, both to Caesar and the god Pan. At this place, Jesus says, ""you are Peter, and on this Rock I will build my church.""

In 2011, we have 2 possible reactions.  Either Jesus is/was ""mistaken"", since there is no church Jesus built on that rock at Caesara Phillipi OR, he was/is refering to Peter, his apostle.",1317686400,3,622,4.535714285714286
8172658,5,B000MV8JFK,"Steve Ray does exceptional work as he traces the footsteps of one of my favorite saints, Peter, Keeper of the Keys. I highly recommend this DVD. It truly brings scripture alive. The vistas are so beautiful and the music is exciting and vibrant.
I am planning on purchasing another in the Footprints of God series.
This is a wonderful evangelizing tool for those who don't realize the important role of Peter in God's plan of establishing one, holy, Catholic and apostolic church.
Thank you, Steve, for your zeal. St. Peter, pray for us!",1236816000,2,536,4.774193548387097
