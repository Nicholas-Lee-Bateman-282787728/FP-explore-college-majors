7037480,5,B00UGPLW8S,"The Dallas Cowboys have a history as rich as any in the NFL. From beginning to end, names like Bob Hayes, Randy White, Tony Dorsett, Herschel Walker, Troy Aikman, and Emmitt Smith fill up this DVD with spectacular highlights. With the Big Tuna sparking a renewed interest in the Dallas Cowboys, longtime and new fans will discover why the Dallas Cowboys are known as ""America's Team."" Disc 1 contains a compacted year-by-year analysis with special spotlights on individual stars such as Ed Jones and Thomas Henderson. Disc 2 contains the 1992/93 NFC Championship game play-by-play, a real treat for those that missed the original broadcast. This DVD has it all. Highly recommended for Cowboys fans.",1081209600,32,698,5.078260869565217
7037481,5,B00UGPLW8S,"This 2-disc set is the ""typical"" outstanding product we've come to expect from NFL Films.  The first disc contains a 72-minute history of the Dallas Cowboys from their first season of 1960 through the 2002 season.  A lot is packed into these 72-minutes, but of course for diehard Cowboy fans, it still leaves us wishing for more.  The history is presented primarily chronologically, but there are some topics- the Redskin/Cowboy rivalry or the Cowboy image- where this strict chronology is broken.
The second DVD contains a 70-minute program of the Cowboy-49er NFC Championship game played on the January 17, 1993.  That would be my pick for best Cowboy game of the 1990's.  The game is presented chronologically and although it doesn't include every single play, it is extensive.  A quality production.
The bonus features are primarily player profiles and some game highlights, including the Cowboys' exciting Monday Night game against the New York Giants in 2003.",1079136000,38,965,5.153846153846154
7037482,5,B00UGPLW8S,"Awesome! This is a wonderful DVD. Perfect for people like me (lifelong fans) who want to relive the glorious days of the past. I must admit to tearing up a bit watching Landry pace the sidelines against Green Bay in the mid 60s, and Lilly, Renfro and Staubach vs. Miami in '73 (for starters). But this DVD is also wonderful for newer fans who want to learn about the team. My wife, who more or less started following the Boys when we got married fifteen years ago, seemed to really enjoy it, and commented more than once that it filled in a lot of missing pieces for her. We BOTH learned something thanks to this production, though--in all these years, I had never, until now, heard the story of how the Cowboys-Redskins rivalry got started. Thought I knew, but didn't, not until now... Anyway, this production is tops. Script, audio and video are high quality. Well executed, as Landry might've said.",1072569600,30,901,4.60248447204969

He watched it right away and even made me sit down to watch some of it with him, CONVINCED that this dvd would also make me love the Cowboys. I'll admit, from what I saw, it really did... but I didn't get to see much and would have preferred to see it from the beginning, which I'm sure will be happening soon since he has seen this more than once now! I am not an anti-Cowboys fan, I just don't watch much sports in general. But this dvd seemed to really tug at his heart strings a little while he was watching it and for that.... 5 out of 5 stars!",1358208000,,703,4.0647482014388485
7037652,5,B00UGPLW8S,"After taking their hard knocks as an expansion franchise, coming up short in the late Sixties and early Seventies, and breaking through by winning Super Bowl VI, by the late 1970s the Dallas Cowboys came to be known as ""America's Team"" due to their star power and sustained excellence.  This DVD set traces the history of the franchise from its start in 1960 up through 2003, the first year of the Bill Parcells era.

This history contains interview clips from Tex Schramm, Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson, and most of the great players of the franchise's first 44 seasons.  Highlighted are the roles that the great coaches and players played, the innovations that Landry made on both sides of the ball, and the rivalry with the Washington Redskins.  There is great footage of most of the team's Super Bowls and key games, both playoff and regular season.

The bonus DVD is the ""NFL's Greatest Games"" broadcast of the 1992 NFC Championship Game, when the Cowboys advanced to the first Super Bowl of the Jimmy Johnson era and avenged The Catch of 11 years earlier.  This set is a good, brief history of the Dallas Cowboys.",1325116800,,1115,4.721649484536083

7037658,5,B00UGPLW8S,"This is a must have for any fan of the Cowboys. The historical disc is excellent, though brief, but the bonus disc is amazing since it contains the 1992 NFC Championship game against the 49ers in its entirety...well, almost, for it does speed up the 3rd quarter, which is odd since the rest is basically play by play, with replays even.

So my life follows the Cowboys.  I can remember Meredith, Perkins, Hayes,Rentzel,Lilly, Howley,Jordan and Green.  Into the 70s and all the Super Bowls.  My Senior Year was highlighted by the Cowboys winning the Super Bowl.  Things like the decline in the '80.  The rock bottom 1988-89 seasons.  And the great '90s teams and more Super Bowls.  Other reviewers have said their was a renewed interest after Bill Parcells took over in 2003.  But for die hard fans like me the interest is always there.
