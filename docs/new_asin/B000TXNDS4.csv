8211255,5,B000TXNDS4,"What is the bible all about? Where did it come from? Are the stories true or man-made facts?

In Unlocking Ancient Secrets of the Bible,we can finally have an answer for these questions as we join Roger Moore as we travel the ancient roads of the Holy Land and unlock the mysterious secrets that have been the source of wonderment throughout the years. In this documentary,we get to see interviews from scientists, archaeologists, astronomers historians and Biblical scholars as they comment on the history and authenticity of the ancient texts. Aside from that,they all examine the contemporary evidence of the most significant moments from Biblical history from both the Old and the New Testament.

This is one great documentary that can certainly increase the faith of a Christian. It can also give them goose bumps especially as they examine archaeological artifacts and prove their authenticity. While many others can dispute whatever is being stated here especially those who do not believe God's existence at all,the documentary at least does not exaggerate more than what is being found,studied and proved. Aside from that,it works not as a propaganda for the Christian religion but as a study of the existence of the people in the Bible and the events that takes place in it. Overall,it can serve an appetizer for further studies ahead as the men who were interviewed never considered everything found here as final and conclusive.",1417910400,,1440,5.0974576271186445
8211256,5,B000TXNDS4,Very good.  Actual people speaking who do not hate Christians and our beliefs.  I highly recommend this DVD for your own use and also for people who want to see proof of the Bible.,1399939200,,180,4.264705882352941
8211257,1,B000TXNDS4,"I picked this up from a local store, the description on the box lead me to think that it would have some kind of evidence besides ""the bible says"" or ""we found a slab with a name carved on it"". The ""experts"" are young earth creationists one of them said the grand canyon was carved by the flood. When the first showed the name of an expert it was only on the screan a few seconds, so I had to rewind to see where he was from (institute for creation research). When it talks about Noah and Lot it avoids the end of thier stories(Lots incest and Noah's curse of Cannan for Ham seeing Noah naked). It made no mention of who really wrote any of it, they avoided saying how many books Paul wrote just that he was credited with writing many of them. I watched a show on PBS that did talk about what this claims it does. One the plus side the reenactments were actually well done. If you want to convince a skeptic avoid showing them this.",1374364800,3,932,4.154696132596685
8211258,5,B000TXNDS4,"I just happened to catch this on TBN a few minutes ago.  I am a Christian, but think this dvd would be great for non-Christians, skeptics, etc.  The facts are presented and you can decide for yourself what you believe.  As a Christian though, I lost count how many times I got goose bumps!  Seeing St. Paul's Grotto which I never knew existed, was incredible.  They also showed the prison where Paul was imprisoned for two years before his execution.  Also shown, was a painting supposedly painted by Luke!  The palace of King Herod Antipas where Salome danced for him and asked for the head of John The Baptist is shown as well.  I did not know these locations had been discovered.  The film left me wanting to see more archaeological discoveries from the Bible.  There are many more shown than I have mentioned.  Roger Moore makes a great non-biased, friendly host for the program.  Now I am going to buy the dvd to pass around to family and friends.  Hope you find this review helpful.",1250467200,7,988,4.545454545454546
