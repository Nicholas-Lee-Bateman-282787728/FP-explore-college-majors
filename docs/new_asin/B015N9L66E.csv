8734011,5,B015N9L66E,"Of the 3 Angry Birds animated series, Stella is the best. This series has a continuing plot with each episode following the last. The animation is 3D computer animated, and it looks extremely good. This series is a prime example of how 3D animation can surpass 2D animation outside of major Theatrical films.",1484179200,,308,4.830188679245283
