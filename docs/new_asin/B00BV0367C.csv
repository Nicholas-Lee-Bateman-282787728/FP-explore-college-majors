8574421,3,B00BV0367C,"not too bad little story of dumb criminals doing dumb things, but sincerely & well acted.  worth a watch...once.  starring kip pardue who's part was no bigger or more important than aniyone else.  whatever happened to kip anyway?",1531094400,,229,4.973684210526316
8574422,2,B00BV0367C,"This movie has the hallmarks and tropes of a recent film student getting to write and direct with a budget and big names, and imho Jason Krawczyk did do better than George Lucas with THX 1138. I was intrigued with the movie until 25 minutes in, when events turned random, and then I felt a bit like I was watching Robert Duvall and Donald Pleasence wandering through a white void. Maybe when Jason builds a $40B movie empire, we'll look back and laugh... ;)",1522972800,,457,4.4523809523809526
8574423,2,B00BV0367C,I tried to like this. I really did. The movie was not entertaining or amusing. The acting really pulled it down. It was way over the top at times.  I realized what the characters were going for they just didn't make it. There was absolutely no chemistry between any of the actors. Especially the two handcuffed together. It was a really hard movie to watch. Not one chuckle and no love for any of the characters really. Even Vincent Pastore who I loved in the Sopranos was over the top. The story line was also just blah. No real twist or turns you couldn't see coming. You have great reviews on this movie which I think are sketchy but see for yourself. It doesn't get any better after 15 minutes into it.,1514851200,,706,4.348484848484849
8574424,2,B00BV0367C,"I was hoping this would be a secret gem, but it wasn't.  Very disappointed.  Typical characters that I have been rehashed a million times.  Got bored and turned it off.",1499126400,,168,4.533333333333333
8574425,5,B00BV0367C,"The soundtrack to this movie features music from Budos Band, Tom Waits, and a bunch of artists from Dat Tone Records! And I love split screens! I wish I had split screen vision so I could maintain a cubist outlook on life. What would I do if I woke up handcuffed to someone? I would watch this movie.",1368489600,,300,4.189655172413793
8574426,5,B00BV0367C,"Great flim! Incredibly entertaining! I've seen this movie four times already, and I can't wait until I can see it again! I only wish there were a blu-ray release. Well worth the purchase.",1365552000,,187,4.696969696969697
8574427,5,B00BV0367C,"When I saw this movie I thought...BOOM. Newest guilty pleasure. Cool soundtrack, hilariously stupid situations, goofy characters, drama, action, comedy, mystery and finally...one briefcase that holds all the answers...THE BRIEFCASE. Not really a movie for children, unless your children are totally awesome. LOVE THIS CRAZY MOVIE.",1365552000,,330,6.195652173913044
8574428,5,B00BV0367C,"I saw this movie over and over again for the last three years and I can tell you with absolutely no prejudice that it is amazing on every level of filmmaking. You should buy it, watch with a group of people, tell them to do the same, and then buy it again.

- Jason Krawczyk (Director/Writer for ""The Briefcase"")",1365465600,,312,4.288135593220339
