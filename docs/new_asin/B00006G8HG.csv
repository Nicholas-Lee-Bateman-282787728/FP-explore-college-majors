7968256,5,B00006G8HG,"From filmmakers Don Dohler and Joe Ripple, STAKES is a Fantastic Vampire movie! It mixes THE TERMINATOR with classic vampire lore. Recommended.",1363219200,,143,5.545454545454546
7968257,1,B00006G8HG,"""Stakes"" (alternatively titled ""Vampire Stakes"") is another arrow in the low-budget horror quiver of Joe Ripple and Don Dohler. I have seen most of their work, and this one is bad even by their standards. Made in Maryland, largely in a warehouse, the confusing story features a highly ridiculous premise and some of the most spectacularly laughable special effects I have ever seen. The story is simple: three vampires from a parallel Earth teleport to our Earth to feed on and enslave the human race. Thank goodness there are also three violators of the space-time continuum who are professional vampire hunters, led by Dohler regular George Stover as Father O'Grady, the beret-wearing intergalactic space priest. The science and background information provided are beyond comprehensible, the dialogue is awful, and the plot is entirely predictable, right down to the extremely obvious ""twist"" ending, which I won't give away in case someone would make the mistake of thinking they actually wanted to watch this for themselves. The most original thing in the film is the concept of the holy water freezer pops designed by the cop assigned to this supernatural case. Dohler veteran Leanna Chamish stars as Alyssa, The Vampire Queen, and while she looks nice, it's not enough to hold the interest of even the most devoted B-movie aficionado. In other words, she fits into this production perfectly.

""Stakes"" is low-budget filmmaking at its most boring. There are occasional moments of unintentional mirth, but it's so plodding I can't imagine even a Dohler devotee finding it to be compelling. Even at the recent price of one cent (really!), you will most likely feel profoundly ripped off.",1328918400,2,1690,5.1454545454545455
7968258,5,B00006G8HG,"There are so many funny parts in this movie. I could talk about how terrible it is, but the box does the job. If you are into unintentionally hilarious horror films look no further.",1211068800,,181,4.352941176470588
7968259,5,B00006G8HG,"An Earth overflowing with vampires.  In fact there are so many that mankind was overwhelmed and those few mortals have now found a way to escape to our Earth.  But before they use their pathway it is used by three vampires.  Three of the most powerful of the pureblood, Queen Alyssa and her two bodyguards, have decided to start fresh.  By turning our Earth into vampire heaven and into our hell.

The last of the humans, a combat-trained priest, a street-hardened scientist and an electronics expect, now must go after the vampires, save our Earth and keep out of jail.

Having watched Vampire Sisters, a movie made after this one, I really enjoyed seeing some of the same actors and actresses.  The Queen is played by the sexy Leanna Chamish, one of her bodyguards is the shapely Syn DeVil, the priest is played by the George Stover and one of the minor vampires is played by Darla Albornoz.  Even some of the settings are the same.

The idea, like that of Vampire Sisters, is a pretty cool one for a vampire movie.  Extras include bloopers, behind the scenes feature, trailers and commentary by the producer and director.  Maybe I should go buy Harvesters?",1158796800,,1159,4.6600985221674875
7968260,1,B00006G8HG,"So bad in fact I couldn't even finish watching it.  There are so many other, and MUCH better vampire movies out there.  Don't waste your time on this one.  Those people who gave this movie outstanding reviews, must work for Timecrap films, or what ever they're called.  Thrust me on this!",1055376000,,288,4.588235294117647
7968261,2,B00006G8HG,"The mistake you can make is buying this film.
Plot? Vampires from a paralell Earth (one ruled by Vampires) come to our planet and are closely pursued by a trio of vampire killers.
Why is it that all aliens speak American English?
The busty queen of the vampires doesn't even show us her best asset.",1036195200,4,298,4.4363636363636365
7968262,3,B00006G8HG,It has been a long time since a Vampire movie has kept me on the edge of my seat. Stakes will do just that! The talents of Joe Ripple and Don Dohler will be a force to contend with in the future. They have manged to assemble a talented and unique cast. The movie will keep you entertained from start to finish. The fight scenes and sepcial effects have all the qualities of a big budget Hollywood production. ... Bravo to Timewarp films!,1033344000,2,437,4.27710843373494
7968263,5,B00006G8HG,"Following hot on the heels of their last film Harvesters, The gang at Timewarp Films propel their audience into a twisted parallel universe filled with vampires. Joe Ripple once again directs a strong cast staring the always entertaining George Stover, Leanna Chamish and Jamie Bell. This is a fast paced, blood letting, stake through the heart, vamipres going up in flames, Rock and Roll good time. The fantastic vampire disintegration special effects are explained in the DVD bonus - making of the movie. Not being one to give away to much of the story, I did want to comment on one of the vampires first attacks which seems to be a homage to Don Dohler's (the producer of Stakes)first movie The Alien Factor. Personally I can't wait to see what the good people at Timewarp Films will treat us to next. Also watch for Don Dohler's other movies like The Fiend, Night Beast, and The Galaxy Invader. Wow, now that would make a DVD boxed collection to die for, literally!!",1032912000,2,970,4.711764705882353
