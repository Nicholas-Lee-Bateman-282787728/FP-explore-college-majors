I liked Leonardo's form of acting...the story while interesting didn't really have a point to it.  It could have ended that young Santos was the Patrona's lost son, or have some point, but the movie itself seemed somewhat pointless, but carried my attention right up to the very sudden and abrupt ending. It could have done more, but I would recommend it.",1060560000,,452,4.708860759493671
