3952994,5,B002MXG570,"After watching thru Four Previous SNL seasons, they always seemed to be hit and miss. Certain skits would come across flat, some funny, some not and some skits depressing. The show was groundbreaking, but I found with the 5th season it is really funny, and it just flows.

Yes at this point many great cast members have left the show, but the cast of Bill, Gilda, Jane, really come into their own. Additons like Harry Shearer was much needed.

Some of the best eps are Teri Garr She is so damn funny! The Martin Sheen show was great also. The musical guests were so good also, like Bowie's odd style.

I can't say enough how great this season is. It never feels boring at all.

I can't wait for further seasons, some believe we won't see the non-Lorne years, but that is probably up in the air. I would much rather start back up when Lorne comes back for 1985, cause the show really picks up esp the following season with great new cast members Phil Hartman, Jan Hooks. Those years are golden! I can't wait for those. I feel 1985 thru the 90's were really good times for SNL, there were some roadbumps but they are still great.",1259884800,3,1127,4.37799043062201
3952995,3,B002MXG570,"Without a doubt, the first five years of Saturday Night Live were the best years of SNL.  Well, the first four - at least.  By the fifth year, the remaining cast and writers were so burnt-out that it hurt the quality of the show.

John Belushi and Dan Aykroid left the show after season four.  Aykroid had told SNL producer/creator Lorne Michaels going into the fifth year that he would stay on as a castmember, but not as a writer -- then Dan had found out that he and John were given the chance to make The Blues Brothers movie starting that November, so Dan left too.  As a replacement for the two, Lorne hired on Harry Shearer - who felt he was handed a raw deal (he kinda was).  As the story goes, he was hired on as a writer/castmember by Lorne, but the others at SNL were told that he was hired on just as a writer.  This brought some bitterness towards him from the other cast and writers when he would write himself into scenes.  They thought he was just some stupid new writer, who didn't know that it was frowned upon to write yourself into sketches, week after week.  After a friendly dispute with Lorne thereafter, Harry's time on SNL was pretty much over.  Harry's side of the story states that Lorne was as friendly as can be, and said he would make everything all right.  And then, Lorne simply decided that he wasn't going to do business with Harry anymore.  Harry was caught completely off guard, and hated Lorne afterwards.  Many have said that Lorne Michaels conducts business in an unusual way.

With John and Dan gone from the show, a major majority of the male characters went to Bill Murray, which made him feel overwhelmed.  He himself had just finished a starring role in the movie Meatballs.  Most all the male sketches went to John and Dan on the seasons before.  Bill has said some years later that he felt kinda bitter about that fifth season because of it.  Gilda Radner was very burnt-out in this season because she appeared on Broadway (in her own show - Gilda Live!) during the summer between seasons four and five.  Lorne Michaels had produced Gilda's broadway show - which made him on the edge too.  Laraine and Garrett weren't featured much in this season.  One may speculate that drugs was a factor in that scenerio (and could be right...it was a different time...no judgement needed).  As far as Jane Curtin was concerned, she was happy to see John and Danny leave.  She considered them the bad boys of SNL.  All she cared is that she had Weekend Update, so she could care less about everything else.

Keep an eye open in this fifth season for a sketch involving writer (now Senator) Al Franken called ""Limo for a Lame-O"".  Lorne Michaels got alot of heat for that sketch from one of the NBC heads at the time, Fred Silverman.  Al Franken refered to Silverman as a Lame-O for riding around in an NBC limo everywhere.  For some reason, Al thought that Silverman didn't deserve to ride in that limo.  Right before this happened, Fred Silverman had requested from Lorne to put Gilda Radner in her own show, the following season.  Silverman saw Gilda as the next Lucille Ball.  Lorne said no, and Fred was angry.  A few days before the ""Limo for Lame-O"" sketch aired, Lorne and Silverman were schelduled to have a meeting, which Silverman didn't make it to.  In the end, Silverman thought the ""Lame-O"" sketch was Lorne's reaction to Silverman missing their meeting.

As many know, this fifth season was the last season for many.  All the cast (although i think Harry Shearer returned for one season sometime later), and most all the writers.  And of course, Lorne Michaels left too.  He would return to SNL some five years later.  Lorne had suggested to NBC that Al Franken take over as the new head of Saturday Night Live.  Of course after the ""Limo for Lame-O"" sketch, Fred Silverman was not going to make Al the new SNL guy.  The person that NBC chose to run Saturday Night Live was a lady who acted as an 'asscociate producer' during those first five years, Jean Doumanian.  She wasn't given a chance by her staff, or anybody for that matter.  There were petitions being sent around hoping to get her fired from day one.  She only lasted 10 months.  One major note was that she wasn't a comedy writer.  To run a show like Saturday Night Live - you need to be trained in the ways of comedy writing.

The one major reason why the first five years, the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players, and their writers will always be better than any other SNL cast and writers is this:  they didn't know that they were going to be breaking into fame by being on the show.  They didn't know that Saturday Night Live was going to be a comedy show that everyone would see.  That it would launch them into careers.  Every other SNL castmember after them knows that SNL can be a show that could possibly launch their career.  And they focus on that.  They focus on that there could be some very important people watching them, and they are playing to them.  And it hurts their work.  It hurts the quality of their work.  They may have good material, but it could be better if their thoughts aren't lost on SNL being the stepping stones they want to hopefully give them a successful comedy career.  The original cast didn't know this.  And that made the quality of their work great.  And you have to give credit to Lorne Michaels towards the end of that first era.  As his cast and writers were started to develop big egos, Lorne's major job was to help keep things together.  After seeing Chevy Chase leave the show and become a star.  After seeing the same thing start to happen to Belushi.  With the critics and the papers, and all, talking about how great this show is, how these men and women have potential for greatness -- Lorne's job (which he did well) was to hold this group together, and make this thing work.  There will never be another cast or writers like these.",1259625600,23,5902,4.478424015009381
3952996,5,B002MXG570,you can waste your time comparing seasons and cast members and being an overly critical comedy snob all you want. I just love these SNL collections because these episodes are like a time travel machine. No other show has the ability to transport me back in time as well as SNL does. I'm hoping they eventually release every season ever made on DVD.,1259539200,3,348,4.5396825396825395
3952997,4,B002MXG570,"So the final Season of the original Not ready For Prime Time Players is being released.
There are a number of rare sketches from this season aired  only once and not put into
the syndication package (aired as either 30 minute or 60 minute shows, but always editing
out close to 20 minutes of the original 90 minute length). So the restoration will
show me sketches not seen since 1979. But that is not the reason to buy this set.

It is the Music Guests!! First the is the 3 songs pefromed by Bob Dylan in his
ONLY SNL appearance. All of those songs are from his SLOW TRAIN RUNNING tour
(religious) but the songs are performed very well. (One of Dylans few TV apperances
that actually was stellar). All three songs are solid performances.  Then there are
the 2 infamous songs by an(so they say at the time) inebriated or (?)
Marianne Faithfull she sings Broken English and Guilt) Guilt was not put into syndication,
and it is the better performance!
Add the Greatful Dead , Randy Newman and a few more musical gems (more solo
songs from Paul Simon).

This season gets 5 stars
for music and only 3 for the sketch content...what could they really do,
they lost Belushi, then Aykroyd and Chase had long ago departed leaving
Bill Murray to take on many roles. Hey, the season at least gave some needed
and neglected sketch time to Garrett Morris LOL.  Cant wait for the release!",1256342400,4,1374,4.502008032128514
3952998,4,B002MXG570,"I'm looking forward to completing my collection of the original-cast series. The Season 5 episodes are always bittersweet for me to watch because it reminds me of the dread I was feeling at the time, knowing that the original cast would be leaving for good. I missed Belushi and Aykroyd (although Belushi does put in a short cameo, via sance, during one of the cold openings), and boy, in retrospect their absence is glaring. Just a few highlights/recollections:

1. The quality of the show definitely begins to wane here, although come 1980-81, it was easy to render this season brilliant by comparison.  With the Not Ready for Primetime Players pared down to five, heavy reliance upon Harry Shearer, Fr. Guido Sarducci (Don Novello), Franken & Davis, Mr. Bill (Walter Williams) and Paul Schaffer grows.  Although all talented in their own right, they don't quite fill the void. Gone are the beloved Festrunk Brothers, The Coneheads, The Bees, Point Counterpoint, the Samurai, The Blues Brothers and the brilliant Olympia Caf. The good news is that Bill Murray becomes a major powerhouse/focal point, returning with the ever-engaging Stargazer, Nerds and Nick the Lounge Singer bits. Gilda Radner is also a force, bringing back classics like Judy Miller and Rosanne Rosanadana.

2. Highlight sketches - the trademark, vintage SNL style is still firmly in place, and the show (unlike today) wasn't afraid to showcase quieter, ensemble, subtly comedic, human interest pieces, such as a teacher's union meeting sketch from the Martin Sheen episode, or ""Aunt Judy's Basement"" from the Bea Arthur show (premise: grown, adult ""kids"" forced to eat at the ""children's table"" during a family gathering).  It was always a treat when Steve Martin hosted, and there are some strong sketches, such as ""The Vandals"", a historical comedy piece similar in tone to the two ""Theodoric of York"" bits from previous seasons, as well as the seemingly improvised time-filler ""What the Hell Is That?"" with Murray. The ""Black Shadow"" with host Bill Russell is sure to garner laughs with its now-very-un-PC racial humor, not to mention the sick joke that is Buck Henry's ""Uncle Roy."" Andy Kauffman begins his phase wrestling women, outrageously playing the sexist baddie role to the hilt, so much so that feminist Bea Arthur feels compelled to comment on it. A trend begins in this season, imo, of the show trying too hard with political humor, such as the obtuse presidential campaign sketch which opens the Terri Garr episode. It goes on way too long, and seems to be trying to cram as many references as possible, mostly at the expense of generating laughs. This problem persists with the show today.

3. Chevy Chase - As in the past, the return of prodigal son Chase is wrought with the bizarre. Chevy was going through a musical phase at this point (he even released an album!) and fancied himself a blues man a la Ray Charles. Let's just say his take on ""Sixteen Tons"" is an acquired taste. To make matters worse, this show included two songs from Marianne Faithful, who in my view is like listening to a cat getting its neck wrung. This show also opens with ""The Bel Aires"", a twice-tried take on an OPEC version of the ""Beverly Hillbillies."" I remember the original airing of this one well because Don Novello paints private parts onto a Venus de Milo statue at the beginning. In subsequent airings, this is always censored/deleted, but the statue is clearly visible in the background. It'll be interesting to see if it's restored here.

4. Music  - Wonderfully eclectic as usual. With this season, we're made well-aware of the approaching `80s new wave and its disastrous accompanying fashion trends with such bands as Desmond Child and Rouge (who are so ""Totally 80s!"" its actually funny) and Gary Numan. The David Bowie appearance is perhaps the most bizarrely theatrical of SNLs history; I remember actually feeling frightened when I watched the marionette superimposed on him during Boys Keep Swinging. It was all just too weird for a kid to see.  Although I'm not a fan, you'll likely find yourself drawn in by the electric performance of the B-52s' ""Rock Lobster."" I'm not sure how well the tune was known at this point, but you'd be hard pressed to find a band that garnered as deafening a reaction from the studio audience. Infectious and energizing, the studio microphones seem on the verge of overload by the end. It's also great to see what must have been one of the last few performances from Sam & Dave, and Chicago (still recovering from the suicide of member Terry Kath) are quite solid with their classic ""I'm a Man"" (previously a classic by Spencer Davis), as well as the disco-tinged ""Street Player"" (yes, even these guys fell prone to the fad!).

5. Side Comment - like the other SNL releases, I'm sure this one will not include the wonderful photography of Edie Baskin, which was always used for the commercial bumpers. I really miss them, and it aggravates me no end that Universal feels they ""aren't part of the show"" (although they do include that last bumper before the credits).

If these releases continue, I think I just may skip season 6. The largely-forgotten, oft-maligned Eddie Murphy/Joe Piscopo years are extremely underrated and I hope to see those eventually as well.",1256256000,67,5286,4.894972067039106
3952999,4,B002MXG570,"SNL was showing signs of burnout by the end of the 70's. With the departure of Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi, two of the show's bigger stars, the writers and cast had to work a little harder with fewer stars to feature. The always fabulous Gilda Radner and Bill Murray were still there to produce the big laughs, being the frontrunner performers. Jane Curtin came into her own this season with some marvelous character work as well as newcomer Harry Shearer (backstage Shearer however, clashed terribly with SNL's writers and staff calling the show ""unprofessional"" and the other cast members ""lazy"") All in all, it was an uneven season (but aren't most of them?). Still the excitement of live late night television permiates, and watching a skit fall flat on its face can be a treat to watch in a weird way for any diehard SNL fan. This set is not totally Belushi-less, he appears on the 100th episode in this DVD set. There are many highs and lows, but it exciting to watch these episodes, because this is when the show was coming off its peak and its ratings were the highest its ever been or will be.",1254700800,5,1103,4.547738693467337
3953000,5,B002MXG570,"Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi have moved on.  Harry Shearer (way before Spinal Tap and before anyone really appreciated his talents) arrives to take their place.  He brings with him his drier, more clever approach to comedy and the show moves somewhat away from the harder-edged belly laughs that Dan & John traded in.  Also, with their absence, Jane Curtin blossoms as she is given far more character work to do.  Bill Murray moves front and center as undisputed male star of the show.  Gilda is still the audience's favorite female.  Sadly, Laraine Newman & Garrett Morris seem to be barely holding on.  This is also the season that introduced the ""featured player.""  As a result, we get to thrill to the comedic stylings of Dan's brother, Peter Aykroyd, and Bill's genius older brother Brian Doyle-Murray.  We get more Father Guido Sarducci (aka Don Novello) and a bunch more Al Franken & Tom Davis.  We get some great hosts (always loved me some Howard Hesseman, Rodney Dangerfield, and Bea Arthur!) and amazing music.  Because of the shift is cast, this season gets way more uneven but the new energy - when it works - seems to breathe new life into the already-predictable format.  This season does not get aired much due to it being Dan-&-John-less, so it's great to see it coming out on DVD finally!",1252886400,28,1306,4.730088495575221

3953003,4,B002MXG570,"OK, the comedy got weaker at this point, but I'm getting this for the sole reason that it contains the episode with David Bowie performing 3 songs with Klaus Nomi.

It brought back many happy memories. The skit spoofing ""Cool Hand Luke"" was the main reason I chose this episode.

I will say one thing and one thing that ruined this season watching the box. I like Harry Shearer in anything........ but not this SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. He was a irritant every time he was featured and I read he wrote himself in sketches and he appeared in the end as many as Bill Murray. He was just annoying little monotone moron that I just wanted to leave the set. He did not fit in the cast with any of the members and the writers that became cast members. He was so square and just acted the same every single time. He was good at fast talking like Aykroyd but not as funny. As anyone watches this box you'll see what I mean. Lorne should of fired him from the get go. He was also hated by the whole ensemble. Also Lorraine and Garrett were seriously on cocaine at this point.

The guest hosts included Steve Martin, Buck Henry, Eric Idle & Rodney Dangerfield plus several more. Was every show a hit?

It was pretty much over after Season Four with the departure of ""The Blues Brothers,"" but Bill Murray, Gilda Radner and Jane Curtain did their best to keep hope afloat.  The writing suffers badly and you get the sinking feeling this is the end.  It pretty much was with the mass exodus that occurred after the season.  Even Lorne Michaels sought greener pastures.

The musical guests continue to appeal.  The Grateful Dead appear in episode 101, but my favorite moment was Bill Murray and Bruce Cockburn joining The Amazing Rhythm Aces in episode 104.

SNL struggled mightily for many years before finally finding its feet again in Season 12.  Not that there weren't some funny moments in between.  After all, Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy passed through the doors of Studio 8H, giving us such memorable sketches as The Whiners and Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood.  But, Lorne Michaels pulled off a miracle resurrecting this show from the dumpster and finding a new cast that could evoke some of the humor from the glory years of 1975-80.",1302739200,4,1053,4.832402234636872
3953073,5,B002MXG570,"That's right, I said it. I have only purchased seasons 1 and 5 because I consider them to be: fearless, courageous, and repeatedly interesting. Not to malign the brilliance of seasons 2-4 ( and most of us know how great they were ), because everyone seems to love them. The players, the sketches, and the music showed SNL at the top of its' game. But I prefer the bookends of Lorne Michaels' first, fantastic reign as creator/producer.

Briefly on season 1: SNL was new and raw, trying to find its' legs, and it was hit and miss throughout; for every bright spot there were just as many clunkers. I was 10 years old, and watched this show with the babysitter while my parents went out. SNL exposed me to new ideas, different types of music, edgy comedy, and all kinds of stuff a kid shouldn't see...THANK GOD !

Seasons 2-4: The glory years. I have nothing new to say about this part of SNL history that hasn't been said before.

Season 5: Ackroyd & Belushi are gone. What's gonna happen on ( and to ) SNL ? Just like that first season, SNL has to find its' legs again. Again, it was hit and miss; a great many sketches fall flat and it's painful when there is so little laughter. But here are the things that make season 5 so great: (1)AWESOME MUSICAL GUESTS...The B52's, BLONDIE, J. Geils Band, The Roches, the Specials, & ( best for last, in a mind blowing appearance ) DAVID BOWIE ! (2) ECCLECTIC HOSTS. Unlike todays' SNL, where the hosts are the hottest, most popular, and prettiest...season 5 had the offbeat and quirky, such as: Rodney Dangerfield, Strother Martin, Bill Russell, Bea Arthur, and many others that wouldn't be considered "" hot/popular/pretty "". (3) ANYTHING GOES. There were very few repeated characters, unlike the previous 3 seasons, where every other week you saw the Coneheads, Roseanne Roseannadanna, or The Festrunk brothers, etc. Instead, we got some of the weirdest, wildest characters/sketches...and even when they didn't quite work they were never boring ! (4) A TIME CAPSULE of the end of the 70's and the beginning of the 80's. The fashions ( uugh ! ), new wave music, dated political humor...warts and all, it is a moment in time before everything became so homogenized...before everything had to look so perfect, like today.

Maybe I'm just wrapped up in my own nostalgic feelings for that time in my life ( I was 15, and life was great even when it sucked ), but I would pick this time in SNLs' history as one of my favorites. If they don't put out anymore collections, I will be fine...but I would love to relive the horror that was,  SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE '80 !",1300924800,6,2599,4.580645161290323
3953074,5,B002MXG570,"Even though I was born after the last year these were on air(1980), out of all SNL skits these will always remain the best. I am collecting the entire set of DVDs from 1975-1980. The humor was creative and brilliant. The fifth year was the final and thus, the year to let it all hang out. In the beginning, they were not sure how well this would go on Saturday Night Television. But as the years progressed, they claimed a following that gave everyone a reason to ""stay home on a Saturday Night"". Thus this was the last year for these particular group of actors and actresses to perform SNL together.
Personally, I think these were the years to have. If you ever wanted to know how it all began....these would be the years to own.",1300060800,2,730,4.375

Bill Murray, Harry Shearer, Al Franken, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, and the whole crew are in the zone.

I've seen all the SNL discs. Season 5 is my favorite. The writers (and the hilarious Paul Shaffer) take the stage and the show gets really edgy and wicked. Great musical guests. Lots of intriguing snapshots of history: Russian ballet dancers defecting to the US, California governor Ronald Reagan mercilessly mocked as a senile coot, basketball star Bill Russell in the best sports star host turn yet.

This season has great maturity and humanity. SNL still has weekly hidden treasures that its detractors can't seem to grasp. Seeing the old stuff will help you appreciate the current cast even more. It's the season where Andy Kaufman brings out his wrestler schtick - visceral television!",1299024000,,955,4.95625
3953076,3,B002MXG570,"Wanted to watch live Chicago.  Got what I wanted.  The skits were weak.  Bill Murray's ""broken-down singer in a lounge"" schtick was the only tolerable moment other than the Chicago performance.",1297900800,,193,5.161290322580645
3953077,3,B002MXG570,"Despite the addition of Harry Shearer (who became a full cast member about halfway through the fifth season) and increased appearances in skits by Paul Schaffer, plus occasional stints by Peter Aykroyd, the writing in this season just failed to measure up to those in the past. In addition, Al Franken's complete inability to be funny sees a lot of wasted time during Weekend Updates and scattered skits elsewhere that should be skipped as soon as he appears on screen. While he's not the only one who should be skipped, he's the worst of the lot. Some of the additions to the cast, including Peter Aykroyd and Harry Shearer, did a great job and were about the only funny castmembers besides Bill Murray this season.

Not until mid-season do the episodes start to have more than one or two funny skits; before that time, one funny skit was about the most they could muster. The best episodes were those hosted by Burt Reynolds, Kirk Douglas, Buck Henry's second, and a few others. With the original presentation, you get to hear the F-bomb dropped by Paul Schaffer in the 100th episode skit that featured John Belushi in a guest appearance (the episode had no host); instead of ""flockin'"" as had been used as the gimmick the entire skit, he lets out a real F-word that surprised me quite a bit. That made the skit funny, since some of the guys clearly heard it and were trying not to react. While the season kept getting better with each episode in broad terms, knowing they would be leaving saw some of the cast clearly not put forth the same efforts as in prior seasons. Bill Murray sees the bulk of the major parts in skits, while Garrett Morris appears but little. Larraine Newman does some hilarious work at times, the best of the women this season, with Gilda a close second. Jane Curtin fell off this season, likely because of taking the load of Weekend Update each week, though she was funny in some of her character sketches.

Sadly, there are no special features worth mentioning. There are three commentaries, two by Buck Henry and the third by Elliot Gould, but they are not particularly illuminating. For instance, in the season finale, Buck notes in his commentary that even he did not understand a joke that he tells, but he does not explain it for those not in the know. The biggest flaw in this commentary is his lack of insights or anything worth hearing about the funniest sketch in SNL history to that time (only the Colonel Angus skit a few decades later comes close): the Lord and Lady Douchebag skit. No matter how many times I watch it, I cannot help but laugh myself silly, but his commentary does not really shed any light on how it came about or any of the other bits of minutia that make such audio tracks worth listening to in the first place. There are no behind the scenes features or interviews or anything else. It's just the episodes as they were aired, sans cleanup of any kind, and shows the lack of interest on the part of the studio to present a superior product.

Overall, this season is subpar. I decided on three stars because some of the later episodes are just too good to miss. However, the lack of special features and the poor quality of the video makes the set not worth the cover price. Fortunately, Amazon has the set significantly discounted, otherwise it would not be worth the purchase or the time spent watching.",1297900800,5,3365,4.577114427860696

3953081,3,B002MXG570,"The content of all the seasons released is fantastic and a great means of reliving the years during which each season came out.  Much respect to the actors and writers for each season.
That said, it is a shame that these seasons are being released so slowly.  With all the TV season DVD sets that are coming out these days, I'm sure NBC (or whoever controls release of the SNL seasons) could easily release more than one season a year.  They owe it to the millions of fans & viewers who have made the show the success that it is.",1270857600,4,529,4.27
3953082,4,B002MXG570,"Let me start of by saying that unlike many others who have already written reviews for Season 5, I actually own and have watched them.

For me this final season of the ""first era"" of SNL illustrated perfectly everything that was right and (sadly) everything that went wrong with what many call the ""golden"" years. You get sublime musical performances by acts like the B-52s and the J. Geils Band along with some nightmare appearances like the frog croaking of Marianne Faithful. Although many bemoan the exit of old cast members, some of the recurring skits (most notably the Nerds) get long in the tooth and lose their humor. It's difficult to maintain one-dimensional characters without running them into the ground and one of the reasons we remember the Coneheads and Samurai characters so well is because we were left wanting more. Unlike many who look at their absence as a great loss, I'm grateful that the actors left before repetitive usage of the same ideas reduced classic characters to the hell of long and unfunny bits that wind up going nowhere.

This is the season that much of America became better acquainted with a few of the people that toiled in the background during the first 4 years. Al Franken and Tom Davis, long involved with the writing of the show, emerge with greater onscreen presence and it lays the groundwork for a lot of the work Franken in particular did later. Brian Doyle Murray, forever consigned to stand in the long shadow cast by his brother Bill, is perhaps the most consistent performer the show will ever see. Even during the most meandering sketches, Brian delivers his lines with confidence and a stronger sense of timing than the rest of the cast. He never loses his place, never flubs a line, and almost never stutters. It stands in stark contrast to the performances of some of the veteran players such as Larraine Newman who shows definite signs of frustration and burnout. The amount of drug usage backstage is now common knowledge and there are times when it had a definite impact on what manifested on camera.

Despite the shortcomings I've mentioned however, there are enough magic moments in Season 5 to make this worth buying. The Rodney Dangerfield episode in particular is fantastic and features a very politically incorrect sketch dealing with the unexpected problems that arise when an older man gets involved sexually with a 10-year-old child. The odds are that if you purchased the earlier seasons you will be buying this one regardless of what any reviewer has to say one way or the other. But if you've watched any of the SNL episodes from the past 10 years or so you do owe it to yourself to buy at least one of the earlier years so you can fully understand how far the show has fallen from the peaks it once reached. This should NOT be the first set you buy. Seasons 2 and 3 in particular are much stronger than this one. But Don Novello (Father Guido Sarducci) is a bigger presence in Season 5 than in any other year and, as I've already stated, Franken & Davis and also Harry Shearer are prominent during this season. That alone makes this set good enough to add to your collection.

Add to that the rare television performances of acts like the Greatful Dead and David Bowie in an environment that allows them to be themselves with less censorship than anywhere else away from an actual concert, and you have no reason to hesitate. As always with a full season of SNL the highs far outnumber the lows and this is the final chance to see the remaining members of the Not Ready for Prime Time Players. Many fans are speculating that the sets will stop at Season 5, but if they continue on beyond here and release the Piscopo, Murphy, and Farley years there will be a large enough fanbase to make them profitable so I think we'll see these continue. Hopefully they will speed up the release schedule a bit though because I'd like to be alive long enough to own them all and at the present rate they'll be shipping quite a few of them to my surviving heirs.",1261958400,27,4021,4.611731843575419
3953083,5,B002MXG570,"Those who think this season will be weaker because of the loss of John Belushi & Dan Akroyd will be surprised to see just how good it is.  Sure, the classic sketches featuring the departed cast are gone, but how many times can you repeat these without them getting stale.  Instead we get some new & fresh sketches that make use of talented Harry Shearer. Don Novello appears more frequently as Father Guido Sarducci, and he is always on the mark, his live interview with Paul & Linda McCartney via satelite from England is priceless (episode #19).

Watching this season makes one wonder what could have happened in season 6 had most of this ensamble stayed on.  The gradual loss of one or two members per year, allowing a few new members to join the cast, keeps things fresh (kind of like M*A*S*H).  But the mass exodis almost killed the show.

It is ironic that in the last show (ep#20) Buck Henry announces that while the original cast would not be back he will return, he never did.  Buck's DVD commentary hints to the rift between NBC and the original cast & producers over their departure as the reason he never returned.  One sketch in this episode does fall flat, and it is dangerously positioned at the beginning of the show.  Buck Henry is introducing ""next years new cast"".  These people are not the real replacement cast, what is worse is that they are not even funny.  Some are introduced with a clunker punchline to follow, others don't even bother to try. Buck's DVD commentary even admits that he did not know where the sketch was going, it was as if it was never finished.  But this one sketch is just a brief clunk in an otherwise enjoyable final show.  You just hope everyone stayed through it to get to the good stuff.  To end it all the cast walks somberly out of the studio, not like excited stars about to embark on new & wonderful projects, but like a group of people who just got their pink slips.  Buck Henry also comments on this odd serious departure.

Where this set falls way short is the lack of any bonus documentary, disc 7 has 70 minutes or more of free space on it! I know there are already documentaries released about the first 5 years, but I think something about the introduction of new members & promotion of secondary members would have been nice.
I will not drop the star rating of this set because of this, it just feels a little empty.

I am just glad this season got released.",1260316800,11,2420,4.45124716553288
