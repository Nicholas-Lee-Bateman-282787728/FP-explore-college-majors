Have not seen them all but the few I have seen are great as far as story lines go. If you like black and white movies of a bygone era, buy this. Don't expect fine wine at the cost of a glass of beer.

Some of the first movies I viewed had poor sound quality, but I could still understand what was being said. Also, I didn't notice a logo being played as someone had mentioned.  Both sides play perfectly. I would definately recommend buying this movie pack if you love these type movies. (meant to give 5 star rating, gave 4 by mistake)",1167609600,16,409,4.602739726027397

2436793,5,B000BQ5IXW,"Help! I have become hopelessly addicted to these 50 pack DVDs. And Dark Crimes Collection is the best of all of them. Sure the sound is sometimes a little tinny and the images could be sharper but you're getting such a value you don't care. And such fabulous rareties! A chance to see the cult actress Mary Beth Hughes in Inner Sanctum-- don't miss the twist ending! There are several of the greatest sleeper mysteries of all time: Fear in the Night and Strange Illusion. Those are the definition of great B films. The Chase is a rare costume adventure with a great performance by Robert Cummings. It's cut for tv but stay with it and you'll see a fine, rare film by an old personal family friend of ours, producer Ed Lasker, who did it with Anthony Mann directing. There are so many great things for the old movie and B movie buff on this DVD. I loved Half a Sinner with one of the world's least appreciated actresses, the great Heather Angel, in a breezy screwball mystery with a light touch. And don't miss the sultry (yes, I said sultry) Angela Lansbury flirting with Raymond Burr in Please Murder Me-- with another socko twist ending. These 50 packs from Mill Creek are such a great value. I hear they dredge these up out of public domain movies but I don't care. I am hopelessly addicted. I can't wait for Nightmare Worlds to come out, the next entry in the series. Thanks, Mill Creek and Amazon.com for all the fabulous viewing pleasure. I just want to curl up and purr with glee!",1154563200,210,1487,4.450549450549451

7 of these movies I have on other DVD's & budget (EP speed) VHS tapes. The rest I have never seen. So far (I've watched the first 4 movies) picture & sound quality are fine. The 2nd movie on disc 1 side 1 (The Red House) has a slightly distorted (buzzy) soundtrack but then I have 2 other copies of the same movie on PD VHS tapes with this same problem & it doesn't distract the enjoyment of this movie too much.

The Hoodlum and Martha Ivers look about the same as in other sets. The Naked Kiss transfer is just AWFUL! But there are plenty of obscure gems on here I have yet to delve into. Of course, it has the usual Mill Creek non-packaging with double sided discs. But a lot of these titles might not hit dvd otherwise.

That is, the booklet identified the movies that I believed I bought -- Film Noir genre movies.
However, not one of the DVD's matched the movies identified in the booklet or on the cover of the box. In fact, all the movies were horror movies of the most violent and gory types.

Kinda like old school TV guide, I guess ;-((  . There are 4 or so movies on one side and 4 on the flip side of the same DVD, and each DVD is labeled :for Example : Disc 4 Side A ( and then the movie titles )  That's a bit inconvenient, but for the price, no big deal.

I. I didn't like the 70's as I was living through that decade,  and I certainly don't  want to  see 50 Drive In crappy movies all winter long. I looked through each pack of DVDs, and sure enough NONE of them were  the titles in the Dark Crime Booklet or the Dark Crime Packaging . I only paid 15 bucks for this item and I hate the inconvenience of going to the post office and  sending it back ( especially this time of year )...

2436884,5,B000BQ5IXW,"I just found this for $7 at local store and even though I had a few movies on it already on some other similar sets. I love these old b&w mystery,
horror, film noir type movies I use to watch on the late show as a kid and I still love them. I can say it's worth $20 at least and many of them are
better than some of the bigger more known movies from the same time. I love the booklet included that describes each movie in detail. It has
some great movies like Gaslight [British version which is superior to the American version] and Strange Love of Martha Ivers with Barbara
Stanwyck and Kirk Douglas which is fantastic. Also Love from a Stranger with Basil Rathbone which I had on VHS for years and is great.
Also The Chase, DOA, Man who cheated Himself are classic film noir must haves. The rest I have not seen many I just watched The Strange Woman which stars Louis Heywood and George Sanders which is a terrific dark movie much like House of 7 Gables with Sanders and Price. Also Please Murder Me with a very Perry Mason character played by Raymond Burr! which stars Angela Lansbury who plays a evil woman who kills for money and she's also in Life at Stake which is also a great movie. The Limping Man and Trapped with Lloyd Bridges are both
terrific movies too. Half a Sinner with Heather Angel is a Universal Movie and pretty good and the quality is as good as most Universal.
Fear in the Night with Deforest Kelly from Star Trek I have already and is a must have film noir horror classic. The Phantom Fiend is
a great old strange movie based on The Lodger story based on Jack the Ripper but this one is more story than horror and the quality
isn't great but something about it is really good. Too bad this one isn't better quality it would be so much more enjoyable to watch.
Cause for Alarm with Loretta Young is really good film noir and she's always great. I'm finally watching The Hoodlum with the great
character actor Laurence Tierney and is one of the best gangster film noir movies I've seen. He had that tough guy image even
back then when he was a young actor. There's many on here that are taken from live TV back in the 50's and they have some great
well know actors and are good but the quality is lacking because of the technology back then but well worth watching and really good.
As with all Mill Creek dvd's the movies are not re-mastered to perfect quality as most expect these days but being a collector I don't care.
These movies are great old classics and I'm just glad they are available. It's like watching them on late night as a kid all over again!",1455062400,2,2582,4.282208588957055

First, the pros:  I was thrilled to get so many movies at such a great price.

Now, the many cons:  Millcreek Entertainment's transfer of these movies is very poorly done.  The movies are muddy and lots of times the sound is muffled.  Also, the DVD's are double-sided and packaged in envelope sleeves where only one side of the DVD is visible.  Consequently, it is difficult to know just what movies are upon each DVD because you need to take the disc out to see what is on the ""B"" side.  Then, the print upon the DVD is so extremely small until you may just resort to placing the disc in the DVD player to read what the movies are when displayed upon your TV. What a pain!!  Ok regarding the price, the old saying is true:  ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is!!""

I even taped the good ones and re-watched them.
You get the same experience with this collection, only that on an big flat screen it is thrice as frustrating, and believe it or not, in the current case the picture and sound quality are even worse. Much worse; all technical aspects are severely flawed.

The opening titles were quirky, but when the movie started, things settled down and got into a pretty good show that you could both see and hear without much diffuculty.

The good:

1.  50 movies for a low price
2.  A vast array of movies from 1930-1960s
3.  Brief liner note booklet on the movies

The bad:

1. Terrible packaging  (dvds are in cheap black sleeves, with microscopic labeling of movies).  It takes me for ever to find what I want to watch.  They could have least numbered the dvds.  Really cheap and not well thought out.
2. The transfer of movies is sometimes of poor quality, but again you do get 50 movies for a low price. You can't expect CRITERION quality.

2437002,5,B000BQ5IXW,"I'm hooked on these 50-movie Mill Creek/Treeline dvd sets. I own 14 and plan to own many more! They are an unbeatable mix of the unexpected, the silly, the rare, and the hilarious. These are bad movies - possibly the best/worst of the bad movies - all at once, mixed up in a bucket, about 4 movies for $1.

Yes, the video quality is mixed. Yes, an annoying Mill Creek logo pops up onscreen sometimes. Yes, most of these seem to be transferred from VHS sources. Yes, some movies are edited, and yes, sometimes the sound quality isn't ideal. If any of this bothers you, do not buy a 50-movie pack. You will need to pay a little more for individual dvds.

""Dark Crimes"" is good solid suspense and mystery. Plenty of good movies here, all of them old, 1930s-1950s, all black-and-white. (No silents.) It's much more homogenous than most Mill Creek sets, lots of good movies and very few laughably bad ones (though there are still lots of cheapies and oddities). Many well-known actors, like Angela Lansbury and Hedy Lamarr, generally in lesser-known movies. A few 1950s made-for-tv things, with old-time advertising intact.

The emphasis is on noir crime-oriented stories that are NOT traditional detective mysteries. If you're looking for that Sherlock Holmes type of thing, you're better off buying the Mill Creek Mystery Classics set. (Actually the sets compliment each other and can be bought together as a 100-pack).

Lots of twisted and involving movies here: Deforest Kelley (of Star Trek fame) is engaging as a helpless dupe in the unusual and creepy ""Fear in the Night"". Basil Rathbone is a wonderfully slimy fortune hunter in ""Love From a Stranger"", and Erich Von Stroheim is heartbreaking as a trick sharpshooter ruined by a femme fatale in ""The Great Flamarion"". The original British ""Gaslight"" is here, as is the first of Boris Karloff's Mr. Wong series. ""The Naked Kiss"" is a surprisingly gritty story of a reformed prostitute, and ""The Sleeping Tiger"" is about reform gone horribly wrong. Lots of mistaken identities, foggy nights, gangsters, hardboiled cops, guys on the lam and girls on the make. Some morality plays with happy endings, and some stories that end in tears for everyone.

Many truly ""good"" films here, with some cheeseballs thrown in. Some are violent in an old fashioned way, but everything is G (or weak PG) rated so this is an ok choice for the whole family.

There are almost no repeats here from other Mill Creek sets, only 2 that I know of: ""The Capture"" and ""The Devil's Party"". Look at the listing before buying.

Overall, if you like old black and white suspense this is am excellent buy. I love it!",1386288000,25,2635,4.790748898678414

Talking about the print quality and other technical aspects would be useless.  These DVD's are taken from public domain movie prints (or VHS tapes) and at the price, there probably wasn't a lot of expense paid out to make technical corrections.  That said, there are several films well worth seeing, dating from the early days of movie-making up to the 1960's.  Among the 'gems' are 'Gaslight' (original British version), 'The Last Mile', 'The Strange Love of Martha Ivers', 'The Red Barn' and 'D.O.A', (one of the great film noirs) to mention just a few. None of the rest are really bad and many are quite diverting.  If you're a film buff, you'll love all the trivia bits in this collection. If you're just an average viewer and your willing to endure the technical crudities, you'll may enjoy sitting back watching 'stars' such as Ava Gardner, Ann Sheridan, Hedy Lamarr, Yul Brynner, Lee J.Cobb, etc., involved in 'dark crimes' that don't take much time to solve and have some entertaining 'twists and turns' along the way.

I thought I'd try something different. Something new for me. Growing up, I saw my fair share (probably more than my fair share) of bad horror and sci-fi flicks, but it seems that I never ran across a truly bad black and white crime movie. The same holds true in this set. There is not a bad movie to be found in this 50 pack. So why not give it a 10/10 and herald it the best movie pack ever made? Well, Mill Creek that's why. The quality of the video and audio in this set is the worst I've ever seen by Mill Creek. Yes, I know the movies are old, but that's no excuse to have all 50 movies suffering in mediocrity at best, when every one of those films would be entertaining if they had more than passable sound and picture. (and some don't even fare that well). So, On with the films in the set. All of the films are fullscreen and in black and white, so I won't be mentioning this at the end of each films synopsis, just the audio and video quality.

Well now, as I said earlier, there are some decent films here. Quite a lot of them are good in fact. The problem is that most of the time either the picture or the sound (sometimes both) are problematic. There lies the decision for you. Do you have a decent collection of crime, noir and mystery films already? Then you can safely pass this by. But if you somehow missed out on most of those genres, you might want to pick this up as a primer and then go looking for superior copies of your favorites. 5/10.",1366934400,24,30682,4.770911831198191

Re: quality of image in these films:  I was over the moon to note that the print of THE SLEEPING TIGER (1954) with Dirk Bogarde, dir.

The majority of the movies have unacceptably poor video or audio or both. Pretty much the only selections that have decent audio are the sprinkling of television shows that are included (so this really isn't a set of ""50 movies."") The video transfer is excessively bright on most of the videos, to the extent that details are rendered largely indistinguishable.

If you are viewing these on a small screen, such as a portable DVD player or maybe a 20 year old 19"" set, the video quality might be acceptable. But on any modern TV the vast majority of videos in this set are unwatchable.

That's not a great deal at any price - pass this one up and shop around for a different boxed set.",1359417600,7,898,4.4969325153374236

were very dissatisfied by the poor condition of many of the movies. Having purchased
one of the series,I have to agree with them. I think,though,we should see this from
another perspective. The average cinema goer wants to see a perfect product when
viewing a film,which is quite understandable,and happy when this is so.
Then we have the dedicated film-buff,who,if they can't get perfection,will seek
out a particular movie whatever the condition.... the 50 Packs have come along and answered that prayer. A good percentage of
the films have never been seen since first shown in the cinema.
The Pack I recently received contains many in that category....I have noted that
some can now be bought for as little as 10 a pack. Even if one finds 10 out of
50 thats watchable,its good value'

2437039,2,B000BQ5IXW,"Music: To suppress hiss sounds in the high frequencies the music that accompanies the program has been so lowered in volume that you do NOT feel the musical emotion of the film. This makes every single show unnecessarily boring. It took me a while to realize what was going on. I found that on movies that I have duplicate copies by other DVD makers that the sound is much better and the overall effect is dramatically better even though they have more hiss. Hiss is soothing to some people and it is obviously not worth ruining the sound track to suppress it when you compare.

Dialog: It is hard to tell what the actors are saying. Apparently the sound hiss processing makes the sound suddenly go up and down in volume when an actor talks but the high part of the voice is suppressed to eliminate the hiss. This makes every actors voice sound dull and boring and women do NOT sound as feminine as they normally do (you miss the sexy voice of fem fatals). Suddenly you will hear a little more music when the voice is boosted louder reminding you that you are missing the musical sound track thus you are not feeling the emotion of the program.

Story: Some of these are great old B and B+ movies that are worth watching though they are not the highest budget programs so not the best. Sadly they are ruined by the sound processing. As I have said, I have found a copy of some of the movies on other DVD's and they are dramatically better. Sadly rated a 2.",1273536000,6,1456,4.369003690036901

No viewer will appreciate the logo popping up in color during a black and white movie.

2437044,4,B000BQ5IXW,"I got this set primarily for the film noir in it.  But this is hardly a purely ""film noir set"" many of the films to be found here are from the 30s and are more crime/gangster films than film noir which exists mostly (not entirely) in the period of 1941-1958.

If, like me you are seeking some noir this set has the following titles which are pure-to-near-noir:

The Chase
DOA
Fear in the Night
The Great Flamarion
Gaslight
Guest in the House
The Hoodlum
The Inner Sanctum
The Limping Man
The Man Who Cheated Himself
The Man Who Had Influence
Shoot to Kill
Whistle Stop
The Scar
Strange Illusion
The Strange Love of Martha Ivers
A Life at Stake
Please Murder Me
Cause for Alarm!
Woman on the Run
Trapped
Parole Inc.
The Inner Circle

So 23 out of 50 ain't bad.  A few of these are excellent films, ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers,"" ""DOA,"" ""Whistle Stop"" and ""The Scar.""  And there are plenty of lesser surprises which will at least provide entertainment if not warranting repeated viewings.

A final note on the video quality, yes it is hardly perfect, far from it in some cases, but I did not find it to be as bad as some reviewers here seem to believe.  In any case, this set is a good way to get a lot of B-films which are less likely to be restored much better than you find here, and its good for those of us who want to have those rare, low budget films but aren't worried about having the highest quality version.",1202083200,22,1421,4.295880149812734

These films include the commercials, and they are the earliest TV commercials I have ever seen. For example, in 1949 Westinghouse was selling a big, boxy, front-opening washer and dryer set called the ""Laundromat"" using the slogan ""Buy On Proof"". One commercial asks you to call any of their authorized dealers, who will come to your home, pick up a load of your dirty laundry, wash and dry it at their store, and invite you into town to see the results for yourself. Easy payment plans are available.

So you actually get fifty decent movies _plus_ some of the earliest TV commercials. What a deal!

I do have a mild complaint about the disks. 1. they are super cheap. 2. the titles are written in super small text in the inner ring of the disk making it very hard to read.
There are some gems her like The Scar which is a classic dark film noir that succeeds on all levels. Then there are corny gems like Red House.

Plus, many were made-for-TV films, which never had the production quality of a cinema film. So if you are expecting 50 good films, you will be disappointed.
