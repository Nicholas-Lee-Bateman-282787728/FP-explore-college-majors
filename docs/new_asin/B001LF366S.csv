Thank goodness I only waited the 21 mins for ""surely something is coming"" of this short story dribble.  Don't waste any of your time on this.  It is nothing to see.  Nothing.  No story.

8317956,4,B001LF366S,"Indie short ""The Frolic"" runs a tight 22 minutes. And in that 22 minutes, it creates a world beyond ours that can only be called a nightmare.

Psychiatrist David [Michael Reilly Burke] is taking early retirement, unnerved by his interactions with patient ""Johnny Doe,"" a convicted pedophile who has some strange characteristics. He is able to choose whether his image shows up on photographs or videorecordings. He has no name, or many names, as you choose. He's from a faraway place that he will not name. Wherever he is, or thoughts of him are, people are chilled to the bone.

Johnny Doe draws incessantly, child=like pictures of stairways to Heaven and little girls with crossed out eyes--she's not dead, he says, she's dreaming, dreaming of him. He kills little children to take him to ""frolic,"" releasing their souls from their bodies, giving them their heart's desire until they ""dissolve,"" and he has to find another child to frolic with. Even when he is covered in blood, the children want to go with him, crying when the police pull him away.

The Frolic is a disturbing movie; it hints at a larger, ghoulish world where children enjoy pain and degradation, where demons like Johnny Doe are unstoppable, and live by their own set of unknown rules. It is the beginning of a bad dream that never ends.",1289865600,2,1309,4.783185840707965
8317957,4,B001LF366S,"Running at a crisp 22. minutes, a little longer than it takes for the death serum to go through a convicts' arm, ""The Frolic"" achieves the exact vintage Thomas Ligotti psyche rape that the now legendary short story did.
Jacob Cooney and company are out to do a number on the viewer and the number comes up 666 in spades.

Maury Sterling gives a bone chilling, tour de force performance as ""John Doe"", the supernatural pedophile who spends his time illustrating reminiscences of his past ""Frolics"" (abduction and murders of children) in isolation at an anonymous prison somewhere, in that anonymous universe we do not want to be in, but which the author insists we are all, and always will be.  Michael O' Reilly Burke plays the ill fated prison psychologist Dr. Munck, a disillusioned man who wants out of his gloomy profession and no longer has any interest in ""rehabilitating"" or working with the prison population. The *very* anonymous John Doe in particular. Jennifer Aspen, continually checking the heat in the Munck's home and staring at his malevolent countenance from the TV, does a fine job as Mrs. Munck.  Perversely, Sterling's performance begs a question not quite asked in the original short story. Is John Doe really a bad guy?  Is there a metaphysic of doom here so intense that he is indeed taking these children to realms unforeseen, better than the miserable adulthood he sees waiting for all, like some gory Peter Pan?  This is the ruse: Ligotti mixes good and evil (and he is using them in a very real sense to different purposes) to the point where one becomes the other in the blink of an eye.

The goal of the story, brilliantly realized, was deep terror and discomfort.  The film has precisely the same effect.  The mood of it the short film recalls David Fincher's ""Seven"" and William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist III"" simultaneously--though you won't find any of the pea soup salvation Blatty offers here.  One might even say the ending of this film is more horrendous than Fincher's own ""Seven"".  My only quarrel with the film is that it leaves out the surreal, truly haunting epitaph left by Doe at the end of the original story, but I guess that must have been necessary considering the Southern accent the actor affects.

While I did not order ""The Frolic"" from Amazon and it's been sometime I had a chance to watch it, mine came with a short screenplay by Thomas Ligotti and Brandon Trenz as well as an essay by/interview with the author as well a behind the scenes interview with cast and crew (NOT Thomas Ligotti.  The advertising is kind of muddled because when I purchased it I thought that there would be an actual, filmed interview with the author which is actually in the screenplay booklet).

For Thomas Ligotti fans only. Real horror buffs will thrill to the sparse but terrifying little piece (watch for the parking lot scene in particular).",1269907200,4,2882,4.751503006012024
