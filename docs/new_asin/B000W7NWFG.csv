2963060,4,B000W7NWFG,"If you are a senior and looking for an easy-to-follow weight training and stretching video, search no more.  This is the best one on the market.",1214611200,35,144,4.538461538461538
2963061,5,B000W7NWFG,"I am handicapped and no one could recommend any excercises that I could do.  This is perfect for me as I have no balance to speak of and the sitting and standing excercises using a chair are perfect.  My balance has improved, getting up and down from a sitting position has improved drastically, posture has gotten better and walking and going up and down stairs has gotten easier.  Did I mention weight?  I have lost 2 pounds in a few weeks, not changing my eating habits at all.  I would recommend this video to anyone who needs gentle excercise because of age; weight; or physical needs.  It really does work.",1388534400,8,612,4.5181818181818185
2963062,5,B000W7NWFG,"This video is just what my husband and I have been searching for. The stretching exercises are all easy yet they get us to successfully unwind and feel exhilarated afterwards.

2963063,5,B000W7NWFG,"I have worked out for years and now find it more difficult all the time to get to the gym.  So, I ordered this video thinking that now I have no excuse.  It is so well organized and perfect for the senior or near senior to work out in the comfort of your home.
Craig Marcacci does such a good job of explaining each movement and reminding us to be aware of posture, positioning, etc. so we can avoid injury.  I would recommend this video to anyone that wants to stay toned and strong.",1387324800,4,484,4.127659574468085
2963064,5,B000W7NWFG,I bought this video for my Father who is 93 years young.  Since receiving this video my Dad and I both work out every morning with this video.  Previously I was taking my Dad to the Senior Center taking a balance challenge class.  The instructor who was wonderful moved and I did't know what to do since I wanted to make sure that my Dad still be active.  I bought several videos but we were both displeased with them until this came along.  Love it.,1381190400,4,450,4.247058823529412
2963065,5,B000W7NWFG,"I am so impressed with this DVD.  He does the weights, he does the stomach, he does all the right things, but at a pace where Seniors or people with Disabilities can keep up and not overdo.",1376956800,3,189,4.108108108108108
2963066,4,B000W7NWFG,"The workout was what I expected, but I could use more directions on breathing and what muscle I am supposed to be feeling the work in.  I wasn't sure my form was right.  I felt like the video was just helping me count ... I can do that on my own.",1375488000,2,246,3.803921568627451
2963067,5,B000W7NWFG,"This tape is aimed at the older generation. Keeping that in mind, it is exactly what is needed.  Exercises are gentle and easy to perform but they work on balance, core strength and flexibility.  One of the ladies in the class remarked how the workout seems easy and yet the results ""sneak up on you"".

I would highly recommend this DVD.  As a matter of fact,  I will look for another one by Mr. Marcacci.",1372377600,4,405,4.346666666666667
2963068,4,B000W7NWFG,Recommended to me by my trainer's mother. Safely planned routines near or using a chair for balance. Warm up and cool down included. About the right length of time. Instructions clear.,1372291200,5,184,4.967741935483871
2963069,5,B000W7NWFG,My mom is a runner nut wanted to work out her up body. She enjoys this work out and it is effective.,1368835200,,100,3.590909090909091
2963070,2,B000W7NWFG,"I am a senior - but a mobile one.  This is probably perfect for someone who can barely move.  I cannot do the aerobic tapes put out today that are made for the younger generation.  I just cannot jump and bounce like I used to.  I am 67,  BUT - I DO workout......and was hoping this would be great for my age.  It might be - but it is way too slow for me.  I viewed it once and it has sat on my self ever since.",1364428800,3,410,3.6436781609195403
2963071,3,B000W7NWFG,Good exercises but moves too slow. I needed a faster pace but may be perfect for others.  The movements are controlled and certainly help.,1363046400,2,138,4.75
2963072,3,B000W7NWFG,I thought these were chair exercised done sitting in a chair. It is really chair exercises done holding onto the back of a chair. I sent it to my mom who has double knee replacements for a christmas gift. Don't know what she thinks of it yet,1357689600,2,241,4.148936170212766
2963073,5,B000W7NWFG,"It is an easy exercise DVD to do. I love all the movements done standing and sitting. Definitely easy does it!
He is very clear with his instructions and also the fact that I do not have to lie on my back or floor to do the exercises is an enormous relief. Well done Mr Marcacci. Cool down is fab too. Susan",1356825600,,307,3.967741935483871
2963074,4,B000W7NWFG,"This video did not have any ""jump around"" cardio (as I had expected), but was superb in demonstrating the proper form for many isometric-type movements.  If properly done, these exercises provide an excellent platform for range of motion toning and strengthening, most important for senior fitness.  Another reviewer had expressed that this video was a good partner if used in conjunction with a robust walk.  I agree with that.  Consider this 1/2 of a good daily workout at the senior level.",1355356800,6,492,5.037037037037037
2963075,1,B000W7NWFG,It's an OK video I'm sure but being a senior who is handicapped I need to be sitting. It is too much to expect me to return this video. I am not sure who I ordered from but I am sure I am disappointed.,1353888000,,201,3.590909090909091
2963076,5,B000W7NWFG,"I've been using this video for several months and have gradually increased the weights on most of the exercises. The beginning warmup exercises are standing. I have difficulty standing for any length of time so I ""converted"" those to seated and it has worked out fine. Since the exercise sets alternate between seated and standing that conversion has worked out perfectly for me.
I really like this video. It does give me a good workout and I appreciate that it doesn't have a lot of silly comments and/or jokes that you get sick of hearing after a few times.  In that same vein, I really appreciate that the video has a program menu that allows me to skip the Introduction and go straight to the actual exercises.",1353801600,6,714,4.622047244094488
2963077,5,B000W7NWFG,"This DVD with Craig Marcacci is excellent if you are a healthy senior. After an illness that caused me to have  prolonged bed rest I could not do it. I started my exercise program with Stronger Seniors by Anne Pringle Burnell and had a hard time doing it. My husband started doing them with me and enjoyed hers. When I was able to do Anne's, he wanted to try something more challenging with weight lifting so we got Craig's. It is an excellent workout. We do it once a week and Burnell's twice a week as she has three different DVDs. This has made a tremendous difference in how both my husband and I feel. The only negative we could say is that Craig's counting can get monotonous.

2963078,5,B000W7NWFG,"I'm 58 yrs. young and have had a neck fusion, shoulder surgery, and foot surgery. I wanted to get a video that would be gentle physically and I found it! I alternate this DVD with walking one mile everyday. Physically, I feel so much better doing the DVD with the walking as opposed to just the walk. I am stronger due to ""Easy Does It"" and without the neck and shoulder pain!! Hooray!",1330992000,5,385,4.287671232876712
2963079,5,B000W7NWFG,"Slow, steady pace and easy to follow.  Good workout for 'old' bones.
Started to get my flexibility back after a few workouts.  Couple this tape with a bike ride or a 20 minute walk 3x during the week and you'll be feeling more fit.",1329350400,2,231,4.2272727272727275
2963080,5,B000W7NWFG,"I am in my 20s, so I will admit that my roommates laughed a bit when I purchased a ""senior fitness"" DVD. I used to run cross country and swim, so I was in very good shape...until I suffered from a serious illness for 2 years. I was looking for an easy way to get back into exercise, keeping in mind that I get nauseous easily and have a lot of limitations on how much I can eat. This DVD is perfect! It includes stretching and resistance training; you can start off with your own body weight and then add weights or resistance bands if you want to make it more challenging as you progress. I actually feel better than I did when I was running- I'm not sick, tired and injured all the time! So if you can get past the fact that the title says ""for seniors"", this is a great DVD for anyone who is just starting to work out or wants to get back in shape.",1327190400,25,851,4.011764705882353

I did not want a workout that was exhausting as I have never been a big fan of exercising. This DVD gets me off the couch, up and moving, and that is what I was looking for. I will probably buy a more active DVD in the near future, but this one has done what I wanted. My wife and I often do it together and it works for us.

UPDATED 12/23/11- Happy to say I am still using this video and find it very helpful. Nothing to make you sweat, but gets you up and moving, stretching.",1323043200,9,598,3.901639344262295
2963082,5,B000W7NWFG,"As I approach my mid-seventies I know that I am not as limber or have quite the same balance as in past years.  This video is wonderful as it involves stretching, a little of 5 lb hand weights (not included but hit WalMart or K Mart), and no impact exercises.  You can do one or two sections and schedule the rest for a later time or the next day or just do the complete  workout.  AND, you aren't stiff and sore - no pain, no gain - from doing the exercises in this video.  A relaxed pace is a bonus.",1314403200,11,501,3.97
2963083,5,B000W7NWFG,"Two great things happened for me this past year.

First, I discovered the book, Seasoned Romance, which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex, lovemaking, and romance. One of the main common threads running through each extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed, was the importance of exercise and fitness.

Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including this excellent one, Easy Does It, by Craig Marcacci. It's not hard core fitness, but it's a great starting point, especially for seniors who haven't been exercising regularly.

More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.

Thanks, Craig Marcacci, for the great work you are doing for people like me!",1312243200,3,861,5.085106382978723
2963084,5,B000W7NWFG,"I am a 66 year old male, overweight and out of shape who first borrowed this video from my library. After watching the video and doing the exercises, I decided to buy the video so that I can exercise with it on a regular basis.  It gave me good stretching exercises for all the major joints and muscles and good, moderate weight training as well. There was not any single exercise I could not do, and yet I got a good workout and ended the exercise in a moderate sweat.",1298851200,34,469,4.211111111111111
2963085,5,B000W7NWFG,"I purchased this video for my mother at Christmas along with another fitness video for seniors.  She recently told me that she has been working out to the ""Easy Does It"" video and has really enjoyed it.  My mother has not been active for quite a while and in the winter is not able to get out and even do yard work which is part of her routine, so I hope to find more for her like this.",1294963200,8,386,3.9358974358974357

2963088,5,B000W7NWFG,"Although this DVD is directed at ""seniors"", it is actually an excellent exercise video for anyone who is starting an exercise program, who might have physical limitations, who wants to start ""easy"" but effectively, and so on. It is true to its description. It might also be very good as a daily overall warm-up routine for more vigorous exercise, but however it is used, it's well done, clear and well paced.",1238544000,39,408,4.76056338028169
2963089,4,B000W7NWFG,"I purchased this for my 87 year old mother. She followed the entire program and said she would do it again. She generally does not like to do exercises, so I consider this a big success.",1236124800,20,186,4.194444444444445
2963090,5,B000W7NWFG,This is the best video for older adults I have ever used.  No one has to get on the floor which is hard for some 55 plus seniors. It moves fast without wasted time just talking. It is great for men and women.,1220745600,61,208,3.8372093023255816

After watching the video and doing the exercises, I decided to buy the video so that I can exercise with it on a regular basis.  It gave me good stretching exercises for all the major joints and muscles and good, moderate weight training as well. There was not any single exercise I could not do, and yet I got a good workout and ended the exercise in a moderate sweat.",1298851200,34,469,4.211111111111111
3197582,5,B000W7NWFG,"I purchased this video for my mother at Christmas along with another fitness video for seniors.  She recently told me that she has been working out to the ""Easy Does It"" video and has really enjoyed it.  My mother has not been active for quite a while and in the winter is not able to get out and even do yard work which is part of her routine, so I hope to find more for her like this.",1294963200,8,386,3.9358974358974357
3197583,5,B000W7NWFG,This is a great senior exercise video!  I've used it three times a week for two months and plan to continue.,1293926400,10,108,4.142857142857143
3197584,5,B000W7NWFG,"great - perfect for those needing implicit instructions, easy to keep up and follow.
another great feature, different angles making it easy to follow all approaches (showing side view, front and back views, etc.)",1271116800,17,212,5.264705882352941
3197585,5,B000W7NWFG,"Although this DVD is directed at ""seniors"", it is actually an excellent exercise video for anyone who is starting an exercise program, who might have physical limitations, who wants to start ""easy"" but effectively, and so on. It is true to its description. It might also be very good as a daily overall warm-up routine for more vigorous exercise, but however it is used, it's well done, clear and well paced.",1238544000,39,408,4.76056338028169
3197586,4,B000W7NWFG,"I purchased this for my 87 year old mother. She followed the entire program and said she would do it again. She generally does not like to do exercises, so I consider this a big success.",1236124800,20,186,4.194444444444445
3197587,5,B000W7NWFG,This is the best video for older adults I have ever used.  No one has to get on the floor which is hard for some 55 plus seniors. It moves fast without wasted time just talking. It is great for men and women.,1220745600,61,208,3.8372093023255816
8221514,5,B000W7NWFG,"Like having a personal trainer in your home-
I like this DVD because
I can actually do it
 I have gained strength in the 5 weeks I have been doing it (1xa week using 5 and 8 pound dumbells)
The instructor is calm and slow enough for me to follow
Would recommend for seniors over 55 or inactive people
This is a slow paced very basic type of workout without a lot of ""noise""",1486339200,2,373,4.04054054054054
