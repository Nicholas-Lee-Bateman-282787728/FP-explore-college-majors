8047863,3,B0007KN8UW,This video is obviously an older video...the gerenal conscepts are present and able to understand for the most part as long as you are already somewhat familiar with braiding. If you aren't familiar with how to braid this is probably not what you are looking for. I purchased this for my daughter so she could learn ADDITIONAL braiding techniques and for that purpose it does the trick. Fair-Good product.,1328486400,,405,4.884057971014493
8047864,5,B0007KN8UW,"I worked with Karen for a number of years braiding hair at Renaissance Festivals. She is a great braider, and lays out the basic secrets for you in this video.  It is very hard to learn how to braid if you cannot see it done, so a dvd is a fantastic asset.  She shows you how to do basic braids, crown braids, wedding braids, detail braids, and 4 and 5 strand braids. These techniques work on all hair types.

(If you want to do cornrows, these are not the focus of this video. However, cornrows are just french or reverse french braids done in smaller rows, so this will teach you the basic theory and hand-holds for cornrows. This video does not cover weaves and extensions.)",1314748800,,677,4.357142857142857
