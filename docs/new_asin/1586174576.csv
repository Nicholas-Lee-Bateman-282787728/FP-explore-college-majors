3454987,5,1586174576,"This a true gem of a movie. It has amazing performances from great actors such as Maximilian Schell and Ricardo Montalban, and would suit anyone who likes a good movie. If anyone is Catholic, this is especially a great movie, orthodox to its core and accurate with the life of this amazing saint, Saint Joseph of Cupertino (the patron saint of astronauts,pilots, and students preparing for exams--watch the movie to see why). There is nothing weak about this movie. It is especially great in showing how the virtue of humility is the most important in one's efforts to attain holiness and how we are called to do what God wants us to do, not what we want to do. It also shows that anyone can become a saint and also that we should never put our own ambitions above what God wants us to do, or what God is calling others to do, no matter how great or small the task may be.",1296518400,32,872,4.355828220858895

This movie shows how God choose a simple-uneducated man to become a saint. Saint Joseph Desa or Saint Giuseppe Desa in Italian had the mind and heart of a small child. Although Giuseppe couldn't read or write, he understood the Gospel and prayed.

Because Giuseppe had the mind and heart of child, he was humble like a child. God exalted Giuseppe to the priesthood and gave him the power to fly or levitate. This honor confounded some of the intelligent priests in the Franciscan order, who accused Giuseppe to be a fraud.  An Inquisition was made as a result of the accusation of fraud, but Giuseppe was vindicated as shown in the final two scenes of the movie and in the sainthood granted to him.",1284681600,42,854,5.5038167938931295

3455010,4,1586174576,"This movie is not for everyone. You have to appreciate the slow style of story-telling in older movies and fairly lame special effects by today's standards. The abject humility of St. Joseph of Cupertino allowed him to win over those possessing perception of spiritual realities -- his Bishop, for instance -- yet caused him to remain an absolute mystery to priests like Don Raspi, expertly portrayed by Ricardo Montalban in the film. Maximilian Schell turns in a empathic portrayal of a man who would probably be termed mentally-challenged in today's world. My favorite scene is when Gobbo (Carlo Croccolo), one of St. Joseph's main persecutors, has to be dragged away as he screams ""HE'S A SAINT! HE'S A SAINT!!""",1468972800,,714,5.008403361344538

3455073,5,1586174576,"Purchased from Amazon April 2014.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning about the life of this humble person who did amazing things.  Even if one is not Catholic, it's a good movie about a real person.

Recommended book available on Amazon:  Saint Joseph of Copertino by Angelo Pastrovicchi.

The film does not show some of his more public flying  many people on different occasions saw him  float  (fly) above the ground, including crowds of people, friars, and even the Pope.

This 1962 film is in black and white.  The DVD is an excellent transfer with a very clear picture,  contrast, and audio.  The sound quality is very good.  The language is English.  The acting is good and the story is entertaining, although some liberties were taken  not every scene is 100% factual.

However, the movie is based on historical events.  Due to his mental challenges, mother did not want him and he was assigned as a stable boy at a friary.  St. Joseph of Cupertino (Copertino, Italy) was a real person and he did miraculous uncontrolled flying in churches and outside in public, which led him to be scrutinized by Inquisition, and hidden away from people by his religious order.

He had his share of troubles and temptations.  His path to sainthood was not instantaneous it was an arduous road.  Due to his gifts of the Spirit and the challenges he overcame, he is the patron saint of aviators, astronauts, students, and those mentally challenged and forgetful.

Below is from sanfrancisco.asu.edu:
On October 4, 1630, the town of Cupertino held a procession on the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi. Joseph was assisting in the procession when he suddenly soared into the sky, where he remained hovering over the crowd. When he descended and realized what had happened, he became so embarrassed that he fled to his mother's house and hid. This was the first of many flights, which soon earned him the nickname ""the Flying Saint."" However, Joseph also found himself in trouble for returning home with a torn habit when people who regarded him as a prophet or a saint sought relics.

Joseph's life changed dramatically. His flights continued and came with increasing frequency. On hearing the names of Jesus or Mary, the singing of hymns during the feast of St. Francis, or while praying at Mass, he would go into a dazed state and soar into the air, remaining there until a superior commanded him to revive. His most famous flight occurred during an audience before Pope Urban VIII. When he bent down to kiss the Pope's feet, he was suddenly filled with reverence for Christ's Vicar on earth, and was lifted into the air. Only when the Minister General of the Order, who was part of the audience, ordered him down was Joseph able to return to the floor.",1397692800,5,2776,4.7615062761506275
3455074,5,1586174576,This an amazing film about St. Joseph Cuppertino. A very young Ricardo Montelbon also stars in it which was a nice surprise. Wonderful holy film.,1395100800,,145,4.84
3455075,3,1586174576,"This is an amusing film along the lines of a comedy more than a drama. It depicts a saint who stumbled into his vocation completely by chance - although it was his divine fate.
It's not at all an in depth rendering of a saint. It's a lighthearted look at the unpromising beginnings of St. Joseph, and how he was called to his vocation.

It shows that Christian Faith is more but mere intelectual knowledge, but love of God, humilty and simplicity in all actions of our lives. St. Joseph Cuppertino's vocation  to the priesthood was rather based on his humble faith and his love of God, rather than on understanding of worldy wisdom.
