8655005,5,B00K0ZAZG4,"I LOVE Pat Martino-!!!!!!!!!! He has been my all time favorite for years!!!!!!!--
 This video is about his life and well worth it!! The music and history of everybody he was with is awesome and his playing is awesome!!!!!
It really is about his brain aneurism and recovery as well--mostly--

very very very worth it as virtually  everything he has ever done is.

There are great review by George Benson, Steve Khan, Emily Remier--need I go on!!!!!---haha!!!!
 It does dwell on his writings- his sketches which is strange-- that is not his major forte-though they are great as well- but-- the video is very entertaining, and his music on the guitar throughout is great!!!!!!!!!!!! as is is story!!!!!!!!!
