8102397,4,B000DIM5A2,"While `Know your Enemy: Japan' is a powerful and persuasive piece of propaganda, it comes as no surprise to find that this US-made, wartime portrayal of Japan is over-simplified, exaggerated and hypocritical.

Japanese history and religion are presented in order to portray the Japanese as a ""warring, bloodthirsty people"". We are given the sense that they have always been like this, and that they always will be. The Japanese are depicted as ""a nation hell-bent to rule the world or commit national suicide."" The `Tanaka Memorial', a document of dubious authenticity, is described as `Japan's Mein Kampf' and presented as the Japanese master-plan for global domination. The document conveniently describes Japanese plans for invasion of the US mainland (it's interesting to note how easily this rhetoric has been adapted to suit later US military goals, such as the Cold War and now the `War on Terror').

The Japanese are presented as a vermin-like homogenous mass, rather than as individuals, variously described as ""human machines"" and ""willing prisoners"". Japanese soldiers are evocatively described as ""prints from the same negative"". The repetitive sound of a striking hammer provides the haunting, dehumanizing soundtrack for images of soldiers and, disturbingly, children. The Japanese are dehumanized in order to justify their extermination: ""It is necessary to subdue Japan as we would a mad-dog.""

We are given the sense that the Japanese are alien, they're not like us. It's explained that they don't even care when their loved ones die: ""Mothers accept their son's ashes without grief"". They have no interest in the values we hold so dear, such as ""peace, tolerance and equality"". They even tried to ban baseball. Paranoia pervades the narrative. We are told that Japanese agents infiltrated US communities, posing as honest citizens such as shopkeepers and ""strange barbers that didn't talk"".

The film's persuasive power is aided greatly by its use of genuine Japanese footage. Mixed with pro-war propaganda are genuine facts, which would be sure to delight the curious American viewer in other circumstances. In the midst of a long and bloody war in the 1940s however, separating fact from fiction would have been near-impossible.

Ultimately the viewer is left with a deep sense of US hypocrisy. Descriptions of Japanese poverty are ironic given the terrible treatment of the poor in the US, even to this day. Supposed US reverence for values such as ""peace, tolerance and equality"" are hard to stomach when one considers its treatment of minorities and ongoing appetite for war. Descriptions of Japanese brutality against PoWs and against civilians in the Philippines are ironic given US treatment of PoWs, enemy combatants and civilians, even to this day (including war crimes committed during the US's own occupation of the Philippines). The ultimate irony is that even a very honest depiction of the American nation and its people (then or today) would provide an even more disturbing vision.",1292716800,,3015,5.272916666666666

When I searched the internet for information about this film, I ran across a lot of words describing it: ""racist"", ""sarcastic"", and ""infamous"".  It is good to be sensitive about such things, but unfortunately, history proves that from the end of the 19th century until 1945, the Japanese military machine was in fact racist, sarcastic and infamous. Perhaps we needn't be so politically correct.

I have lived in Japan for over 30 years, and I remember when this film was broadcast on the Sunday evening news, translated in Japanese. After the film, the male and female newscasters stated that ""Although this was a proganda film, and a few things are exaggerated, for the most part it is right on the mark"".  I agree.

This broadcast was in response to the great hubbub which has always existed around the history textbooks for Japanese children which have tended to minimize, gloss-over or completely eliminate Japanese war exesses and atrocities from their pages. Time and again, I have seen some politician say something to either justify Japan's wartime agression in Asia, or either suggest that it didn't happen. And every time, the man would be instantly fired from his position, and apologies offered to the offended people of Asia--China and Korea, especially.

When I came to Japan, it was no longer the fascist hell presented here. People now seem more interested in enjoying life in spite of the high prices and extreme climate; they are free to speak out on anything they please.

About once or twice a month, right-wing buses roar past my apartment. There may be one of them or a convoy. They play old war-songs at deafening levels, and I'm surprised that you on the mainland can't hear them! Of course, each bus plays a different song at the same time, so it's a cacaphony, and occasionally they'll use mikes to yell in Hideki Tojo-style. For them, the war was a glorious time to be commemorated. People have told me these right-wingers have yakuza connections, so nobody dares speak up about the noise. At such moments, ""Know Your Enemy-Japan"" seems as now and as real as right outside my window.

My only issue with the film is that it states that Bushido (the way of the samurai) as well as other Japanese sports depend on the art of the ""double-cross"". Perhaps the truth was less interesting: Hitler lied and deceived the countries around him endlessly to win at any cost. He backstabbed those who believed him. Japan's military merely copied this technique, since they were in league with Hitler and Mussolini.

Something I hear from Japanese people again and again is this: ""After the war, we were homeless and hungry. We had been taught to be afraid of the American soldiers who were coming to occupy our land. We were all amazed at the goodness of the American government in feeding us, and the friendliness of the American soldiers toward our people.  We will never forget that.""",1154563200,11,3089,4.811320754716981
