5109707,5,B007S9GE0Q,"I love Fairy Fun. And I think you should keep selling it to people. And I really like it. The fairies are the most fun but Wizzie the Wizard is very silly. I hope you have a fun time with it.

5109708,5,B007S9GE0Q,"My 3 year old daughter loves this video.  My almost 6 year old daughter still watches this video after probably 10 repeats in the last month.  Even I still enjoy this video, and even when I'm busy will stop to watch the dances!  Well choreographed, catchy tunes, and charming storylines.  Great kids video, especially if you have a child that loves to dance!",1377216000,,358,4.634920634920635
5109709,5,B007S9GE0Q,She loves all the characters and songs. The dances are easy to mimic and songs are fun for the little ones to sing along.,1370390400,,121,4.083333333333333
5109710,4,B007S9GE0Q,My daughter loves The Fairies. She sings and dances to them all. It's like the Wiggles for girls. Be sure to get a pair of fairy wings to go with it.,1363737600,,149,3.838709677419355
5109711,5,B007S9GE0Q,"I watched the extras or songs on the dvd first.  They have a guest sing with them and she is fabulous. She was a lot of fun to watch and sing along with the Beach Song.
The Fairies are lively, creative, excited, smiling enthusiastically and so much fun to watch. They have 100% tapped into their inner child and that child is happy and having an exciting time being on the show!

I gave them 5 stars because that is the required amount. I prefer to give them 10. They have a beautiful set to tape the show on. They are good, clean fun and can motivate children to play in their fairy outfits and keep them company. They also talk very soothing and loving when they are showing the children how to do an art project on the dvd. Smaller kids will probably like them the most since they are not very critical and just want to have fun. Moreover, I am sure kids of any age, that love Fairies, would enjoy singing and dancing with the Fairies. I did and I am not a kid!  Happy Fairy Play...young and younger......",1360108800,2,1008,4.239583333333333
5109712,5,B007S9GE0Q,"My daughter watched the Fairies show for the first time during Christmas on Comcast On-Demand and she feel in love. She gets lost in this dvd. She loves the dancing, ballet, and singing and spends the entire time trying to dance like the fairies. This is the perfect dvd for a girly girl that loves ballet.",1360022400,2,306,4.482142857142857

5109714,4,B007S9GE0Q,Someone gave us another of The Fairies' DVD's and then Santa brought this one for Christmas..... it's Australian children's programming.... not the biggest budget and it shows.  But my girls love it.  Completely non-threatening characters who sing and dance in fairy costumes..... huge score for 3 year olds. I gave it 4 stars because it sucks away my soul after the 3rd repeated viewing.,1357430400,3,388,5.046875

8521613,5,B007S9GE0Q,"My daughter loves these movies!! They are very sweet and she sings along and dances with the fairies.  They have lovely Australian accents.  The film is very low-tech, no special effects.  Just some ladies singing and dancing and they also have children that join them.  It's sweet and very much a G-rated film.  No violence, no mean characters.",1449532800,,345,4.879310344827586

8521618,5,B007S9GE0Q,"We first came across ""Meet the Fairies"" on Netflix one day, my 4 year old watched it and she absolutely loved it. The very next day she wanted to watch it again so I went on Netflix to play it for her and they no longer had it, they took it off their site for some reason. So, I came here and found the same one, ""Meet the Fairies"", and my daughter was so happy to get it that I ordered this one too, and she loves it as well. DOWNSIDE, I got free shipping on the 1st one I ordered because I had Amazon Prime at the time and now I don't so, the 2nd one cost $4 for shipping, that pretty much made me paying $8 for the movie but it was worth it to just see the joy my daughter gets from watching it :)",1395014400,,700,3.7364864864864864

8521620,4,B007S9GE0Q,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 4 yr old daughter. She LOVES watching Harmony and Rapsody in ""Meet the Fairies"". She could watch it over and over...

This is still a great show. The characters are fun, the music is catchy, and the fairies are loveable...  But if you are trying to decide between the two, ""Meet the Fairies"" is much better! I do like how it gets her to sit still for an hour though :)",1388016000,,412,4.1375
8521621,5,B007S9GE0Q,It was exactly what we wanted it to be. Daughter watches it over and over again.  Highly recommend for any girl who loves princesses.,1382140800,,133,4.541666666666667
