A no brainer",1475280000,,146,3.9
8231151,2,B000Y789W0,"cant said its what i was hopping for..
mostly interviews - no music ,
no shows and no radiohead on those dvd's
just people from the industry talking about them.
so for fans only i guess..",1359072000,,187,4.222222222222222
8231152,5,B000Y789W0,This is a really good set about my favourite band. The first DVD studies the making and production of the ok computer album with some interesting comments and great footage. The other DVD is a biography of the band and tells how they rose through the ranks to become the fabulous band they are today. A decent set and well worth picking up.,1205971200,,340,4.412698412698413
8231153,4,B000Y789W0,"I ordered this before 10 days and now it's in my hands ! The delivery from the USA to CROATIA took only 10 days ! Amazing Amazone ! :)
I still haven't opened the box because it's for my brothers Birthday.....
I wonder why the two reviews so bad are. Anyway I still think my brother will enjoy his Present !",1201737600,,306,4.032786885245901
8231154,1,B000Y789W0,"I wish I had read the previous reviews before purchasing.  Incredibly boring, poorly shot interviews of a bunch of quasi-journalists saying absolute generalities that anyone who loved ok computer has already thought up themselves.  All participants in these videos are completely or nearly completely unrelated to anything to do with the band.  As for the band themselves - they are barely seen, barely heard.  Lot's of pans of mediocre performance stills.  This really takes the ""UN"" in ""unauthorized documentary"" to a new low!",1201305600,13,528,5.313253012048193
8231155,1,B000Y789W0,"When I bought this I was super psyched... I'm a huge radiohead fan. However, this is kinda a boring documentary box set. First the review of OK Computer I thought would be facinating. Nope. Just a bunch of people who are poorly introduced saying how great each song is, duh, and saying what they think about the lyrics. There is nothing about Radiohead here... it's not really about them and how they put the album together or their actual ideas behind songs. SO that first dvd was an hour wasted. Hoping for something better I popped in the other DVD, Homework, as it's titled. This one sucked even more. It's interviewing other people who love Radiohead... and once again really has nothing to do with radiohead.

Don't waste your time or your money... go out, buy all the radiohead cd's and live performance recording you can and savor the music for yourself... you don't need anyone else to tell you what they think the music says.",1201132800,20,935,4.632530120481928
