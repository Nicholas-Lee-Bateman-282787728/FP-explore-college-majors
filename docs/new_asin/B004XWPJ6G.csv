4498028,5,B004XWPJ6G,"This set is a complete collection of the originals in Japanese with English subtitles. I find it to be a more accurate translation than a lot of the USA versions.

When they translated this over for American audiences and started renaming it ""knights of the zodiac"" they changed some of the storylines a bit and dumbed it down.

This is a pretty large collection on 8 DVD's and covers mulitple series:

Saint Seiya : Sanctuary

Saint Seiya : Asgard

Saint Seiya : Poseidon

Saint Seiya The Hades Vol. 1 - 114
Ages ago,the goddess Athena was served by fighters called Saints who channeled the power of the Cosmos within them. Now a youth named Seiya has trained to become a Saint himself by earning the mystical Cloth of Pegasus. He is joined by other Saints with Cloths of their own to fight for Athena.

Saint Seiya Chapter Inferno Vol. 1 - 13
Seiya and the rest of the Bronze and Gold Saints who have survived the Sanctuary battle have entered the world of the Dead. They are fighting to get to Hades and defeat him.

Saint  Seiya Mei Ou Chapter Elysion-Hen Vol 1 - 6

Just realize this is an import, and as with many asian imports there aren't a bunch of extras. What you are getting is more than made up for in sheer volume of episodes, there's at least 50 hours of entertainment in this set. I watched 2 to 3 episodes a day and it still took me 2 months to get through it all.",1303776000,11,1381,4.317829457364341

4498050,5,B004XWPJ6G,"I cannot begin to describe how entirely satisfied I am in regards to the seller of this product. The Saint Seiya series was one that I followed since I can remember. I learned so much about friendship, courage, spirit and more while watching this anime. I was overjoyed when I was finally able to find the complete collection at a reasonable price. To my surprise, however, the seller was just amamzing. I was given a free gift with my purchase with a personal note attatched from the seller. Granted that it wasn't something of tremedous monetary value, but it was enough to make my smile grow even bigger. I am very thankful for the friendly attitude I was shown. Thank you once again.",1366070400,,687,4.59349593495935
4498051,1,B004XWPJ6G,"This is a bootleg, there is nothing official about it. The cover is fanart, used without permission. The video quality is very poor as is the DVD menus.",1352851200,21,152,4.464285714285714
4498052,4,B004XWPJ6G,"Saint Seiya is a great classic Shonen Jump anime, it has no fillers and is one of few animes that stayed true to the original manga in its original run, unlike others like DBZ, Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece, Saint Seiya is something worth having.",1347494400,,246,4.488888888888889
4498053,1,B004XWPJ6G,i like saint seiya i got this because i tought its was in english or spanish and because it had all the collection wich is hard to find but when i got it i guess its all in japanese and chinese the subtitles are in english wich its hard to watch and read the subtitles and i just seen that some of the cds freezes sometimes and there brandnew and there ither scrat or something is wrong with the cds its like cheap cds or something i try cleaning them and they still do the same thing so i guess it has some thing to do with the cds i am kinds mad because i paid so much for these movies and they suck its like waste of money never will buy these cheap collection cds its like burning your own money or just throwing away your money and its a hassled returning things online i hate that.its not like returning things back to the store this is harder i don't like doing that.i guess i am stuck with this movies don't buy any take it from me.save your money this is not worth it trust me.,1346716800,7,986,4.01015228426396
4498054,5,B004XWPJ6G,"I was shocked as I opened my package expecting it to be exactly like the anime box-set looked in the pictures, but I was wrong! In fact the product contained a medium set filled with 10 DVDs. I was not sure if it was a bonus, but the newest saint seiya series also came with it called, ""Lost Canvas"" plus all five of the movies. I tell you, I wasn't expecting that. Yeah, I see in the pictures that the DVDs looked stacked on top of each other, but it was not this way for me. It didn't look generic and the picture on the front cover is completely different than how the internet version looked. Every disc is protected by a white holder, so it almost looks like a disc holder. So this is more than enough for me and I seriously thank the seller for this product!!!!

Now for the regular saint seiya series, it came like expected. All the episodes are there including the Hade's Chapter. So if you didn't get it, then you should complain about it or have them send it back in exchange for a new one. This is one of those animes that will be a long sit, so be prepared. But it is a all time classic and worth every penny. You will not find saint seiya ANY CHEAPER than this and COMPLETE! In other places, a series like this will run you almost 400 dollars. So get it now before it is too late. This is the perfect bargain price.

As for the picture quality, it looks alright to me. But if you are the kind of person that wants it super clear, then this may bother you. Its not a horrible picture, it looks pretty good. But for someone that is about to get the whole collection, this is a small matter. I think you can find the really expensive one to your liking, but I doubt the picture is any better. If this is no problem for you, you are in for a treat!",1345593600,5,1757,4.089855072463768
4498055,1,B004XWPJ6G,"The video is in very poor quality and 6 dvds came in the same box.
There is no Hades chapters here.",1343952000,25,99,3.761904761904762
4498056,5,B004XWPJ6G,"Well all that I need to say is very simple.  This is an amazing series the characters get very well developed and the action is in your face. The friendship between the main characters drives the story in my opinion. I purchased Saint seiya as soon as I could find a complete series for it.  I buy an insane amount of anime 50+ collection or series, this will be one of my top favorites for a very long time.  The main characters in the series start off as the weakest out of many different saints( armor decides your strength ) but by the end of the series and through it they find there inner strength.  They protect each other and most of all the goddess Athena.  I bought this product from PROMISING and the delivery was fast and they even gave me a free gift!!!!  Never happened to me before I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend using them for your future purchases.",1339718400,,860,4.34375
4498057,5,B004XWPJ6G,"I have been a huge fan of saint seiya for almost 20 years now , and today i watch the sagas daily. its one of the greatest cartoon of all times. not to mention i grew up watching the saga since 1994 in brazil. ii find horrible and sad how united states never finished dubbling the series, leaving us with only 12 volumes that i thought they had great video and outstanding audio. i am one of the biggest fans that suffers today watching the series on low budget copyrights. id like to know where can i obtain this item?  please help a fan follow his dream. thanks much!",1329696000,,569,4.220183486238532

8447573,1,B004XWPJ6G,"The english translations on this are GOD AWFUL, barely even legible at times (incomplete sentences, phrases that make no sense, incorrect spelling),  I can't even believe that they would release this, as if NOBODY proof read the subtitles whatsoever.

BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST OF IT!

 I just bought this recently and it's already skipping and glitching out on one of the discs. I actually would prefer a refund for this piece of garbage, i LOVE this cartoon and know no other way to watch it so i guess i'm stuck with it. NEVER buying from this company EVER again.",1459555200,,570,4.6138613861386135
8447574,1,B004XWPJ6G,"I didn't care much about the quality of the DVD's or the artwork (which are decent), but I'm giving it only one star cause of the subtitles, man are they bad, sometimes youyou can understand them but most of the time they don't make sense, gets annoying real fast.",1457568000,,264,4.408163265306122

8447581,4,B004XWPJ6G,"The one thing I was very disappointed in, is that The Lost Canvas is not complete. After researching, the company who originally worked on the lost canvas doesn't plan to continue with season 3 so you will have to read the manga to find out what happens.

As far as the product itself, I find it odd that certain section would have 2 dvd stacked on top of each other and the order towards the middle is not right. Like I'd have to jump a couple disk ahead then back to the other disk to continue the story line.",1375056000,,511,4.161616161616162
