4117761,4,B003F3NDP8,"Make no mistake: this show is basically a glorified soap opera, with much better acting and plots. However, it is pretty funny. The plots get so off the wall sometimes that it becomes hilarious. Each season has a separate story arch that usually involves a murder or somebody's deep, dark secret. Each episode also features a unique story and many plot twists. Things get pretty zany after several seasons. Over the past 5 years, it has included many (many) extramarital affairs, murders, holdups, hurricanes, gang lords, and dead bodies in the freezer.

This season has been pretty good so far. Angie and Danny as the new family on the block are good additions to the show. Angie in particular adds a lot of spunk. Unfortunately, it hasn't really developed the theme or subplot as strongly as some past seasons. It's only now that the backstory to Danny is becoming revealed. Also, the whole plane crash thing was kind of silly. However, a lot of the episodes were funny, especially the whole Russian gold-digger.",1271548800,11,1014,4.861271676300578

4117897,5,B003F3NDP8,"I bought the entire series.  It was one of my favorite programs.  How wonderful is it to watch this series WITH NO COMMERCIALS, it's great.  Highly recommend to buy a series that you love and want to watch over and over without commercials.  It's a NEW experience. The problem is, that After watching something I love without commercials, it's hard to go back to commercials.  I don't know what's happening in TV land but the commercials are now 6 minutes long, but the worst thing is there are more commercial breaks than ever.  I am about to consider not watching TV anymore.  WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE AFFECTED BY SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY COMMERCIALS.  It is totally ridiculous.  I have several friends who are dropping regular TV and streaming movies so they don't have to deal with THIS MANY COMMERCIALS IN ONE PROGRAM.  Yes!!!! I am able to FF through the commercials, but there are so many now, that it doesn't make a difference in not wanting to watch regular TV and I have been spoiled by watching Desperate Housewives and Becker without commercials, two programs I can watch over and over.  I m so spoiled now.",1445644800,2,1113,4.627551020408164

4118089,3,B003F3NDP8,"It's not easy deciding when it's time to leave a show that you've been involved in for several years. But after watching the sixth season of Desperate Housewives on DVD, which I think didn't live up to the potential that was there in its first seasons, I just think it's time for me to leave the Lane. For after seeing the downhill quality in term of plotlines and writing, I just don't want to buy the last two seasons of a tragicomedy-satire I think should have been finished since its fourth season instead of becoming this daytime soap opera.

Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the actors. They all did the best job with what they got, even Teri whose storylines became dull after the first season and made me think that Susan should have been the one to die from Zachary's gun in the Second Season Premiere. But as Marc Cherry became more interested in delegating his writing to other people while organising TV pilots (the failed Hallelujah and the upcoming Devious Maids) or a mini-series called Another Housewife, An uninspiring, ridiculous and self-satisfied cell phone plug, I just think Desperate Housewives became a joke with rehashed storylines. For once again, we have Housewives cheating their husbands with other men, secret children, people trying to bribe their neighbors to escape their frustrating lives, a mystery, and of course a big tragedy happening in the middle of the season. Now as for the tragedy episode, it worked well when it was the Supermarket shooting or the Tornado, but as for the plane landing on the street, I felt this was over the top and made me wonder what would happen in the next seasons. Would we have aliens, zombies, Mecha Streisand (wait they did it in South Park)? Because by the time we get to the fifth season, we find out that this accident episode becomes a plot device to get rid of dangerous or secondary characters that have no more use in the show, and to bring bigger ratings.

As for the two mysteries in this season, I found them the only things that made the show worth watching. But of them, I found the Bolen, which was good, to be too separated from the other Housewives lives and I think it should have been instead an original series rather than a ""one season"" mystery. As for the mysterious strangler, I thought it was all right, but it should have been finished at the middle of the season instead of the final episode. And as for other Housewives storylines, Bree's were probably the most terrible as she has to deal with an adultery relationship that looked too much like a conventional soap opera, and a second one involving Bree's new employee whose situation is too similar to Kayla and becomes a plot device to reintroduce a first season plot line that should have been dealt seasons ago: Andrew running over Juanita Solis in season 1. Not only that, I think it should have been Orson Hodge who should have had the chance to act more viciously rather than some character who only appears in this season. As for Lynette, her baby storyline that only happened in the awful ""If"" episode should have been instead a major plotline for the rest of her show since it would have allowed her to see her life turn into a new perspective and make her grow.

On another point, I think the main problem the show had is that the Housewives' lives became separated and dull compared to the mysteries that secondary characters always got to do. To me, what made Mary Alice's mystery worked so well was that the Housewives were involved in her life and so there was the possibility that they could have witnessed something that they never got to see before. Personnally, I think it would have been great if that show's mystery had opened a Pandora Box that would have revealed dangerous secrets in the Housewives' lives that would have become the main focus in the seasons, that almost everybody would have found out, and that it would have brought forth consequences as major to them as to what Mary Alice had to live.

But unfortunately, it didn't happen. And so, I have come to see a show go from a clever tragicomedy-satire on suburbia to a dull complacent, and self-satisfied, day-time soap opera. Of which I don't want to invest myself anymore.

It was good while it lasted but for me...

So long Wisteria Lane.",1369008000,,4288,4.628120893561104

I'll put it this way, they could have used the ""slim packs"" in which case, I would tend to agree, but that's besides the point.

As much as the cast has changed over the years, things pretty much stay the same on Wisteria Lane.  Through it all you see the same petty back biting, shifty characters and malevolence characteristic of soap operas.  The show had a relatively promising start with the mystery surrounding the death of Mary Alice.  Of course, there was only so far you could take this, and her voice no longer carries with it much concern as she continues to watch over her little enclave.  In a rather desperate gesture, the writers have resurrected Paul Young, but there never was anything particularly appealing about him.

4118181,3,B003F3NDP8,"I have watched Desperate Housewives for the last few years and have tremendously enjoyed the episodes. In Season Six the inhabitants on Wisteria Lane are back to regale us with their quirky and idiosyncratic behavior.

Ominous and evil characters - the Bolens move into Wisteria Lane and take up the house in which the previous inhabitant had committed suicide. Soon things become sinister and people start getting 'bumped' off apart from beautiful girls who suddenly vanish. Susan Mayer's daughter, Julie, is hospitalized and Susan is left to grieve - bringing out Teri Hatcher's acting ability that is as flawless as she considers everyone to be.

Lynette and Tom are expecting the stock to visit them and their children find it strange that their parents are ""still at it"". Later when Angie Bolen is in danger the surprising life-saver is none other than Gabriel, who puts her own life on the line.

Unfortunately the extras with this sixth season are very few, which leaves the viewer 'wanting more'- gasping for more. That apart: Too many new characters and story-lines seem to have drowned out the lives of the main players. Let's hope that Marc Cherry creates a better ""packaged"" and juicier storyline in Season Seven.

I do strongly feel that something should - read MUST - be done about the packing of the DVDs in Season Seven. Season Six packing left a lot to be desired. The flimsy middle partition that contained DVDs on either side is certainly not the best way to package DVDs. That aside Desperate Housewives Season Six is series worth possessing on DVDs.",1299715200,,1570,4.890977443609023

Susan, after so much drama and terrible experiences finally gets her happiness again, remarrying Mike Delfino, her show's regular beau. Lynette has to deal with her pregnancy and Bree with her affair with Karl Meyer, Susan's ex-husband. Gabrielle, now mother from last season, has another child to take care of, Carlos's neice, Ana, a troublesome teenager from the start.

Meanwhile, the most troubled housewife probably remains the one that isn't one: Katherine. Having to deal with Susan and Mike's relationship, and her own failed one, she isn't someone to be called stable in this season for those who are fans of her.

The show also introduces a new family onto Wisteria Lane: Angie Bolen, and interesting, historical last, name, fitting to the fiery spirit this mother has when protecting her family. Also included in this seasons wild showings is a plane crash right in the middle of the lane, and the reprecussions from that, as well as a mysterious strangler who begins to kill and hurt many of our girls.

Definitely a great season not to be missed.",1296604800,,1092,4.950819672131147

4118245,4,B003F3NDP8,"**NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

When viewers last left Wisteria Lane at the end of Season Five of ""Desperate Housewives"", a new family was moving into the neighborhood.

Drea de Matteo (""The Sopranos"") plays the new housewife on the Lane. Angie Bolen is a brash Italian New Yorker who brings with her to the suburbs her twitchy husband Nick and son Danny. What would new residents be without some dark secret? Well, it seems Angie and her two men are hiding out from the Feds because of some terrorist activity in their past.

The Bolen clan's arrival coincides with a rash of stranglings in Fairview, and the most recent young female victim is Susan's daughter Julie Mayer!

At first I didn't care for the Angie character, but when things start really cooking in the second half of the season, I was really rooting for her and was sorry she won't be back next season.

It was great to see Angie bail Bree out of a jam, TWICE this season. Another fun moment occurs when Angie gets some news about the person blackmailing her. That slight grin of satisfaction in the hospital was priceless!

It was a welcome change to have de Matteo replace Nicollette Sheridan, because I felt Edie's slutty ways were getting old.

Speaking of old, as the season began I was praying it was NOT Susan under that bridal veil. For some reason the writers seem to think all viewers want to see is she and Mike. I wish the pair of them had been written out of the show along with Edie. I was sick of their on-and-off again romance by the end of Season Three.

Although I wasn't thrilled with the reunion of Susan and Mike, the good thing that comes of that is that Dana Delany finally gets some decent material to work with after a dull Season Five. It was interesting to see Catherine slowly unravel and I kept wishing she'd have more screen time. The developments with Julie Benz' character Robin were a welcome surprise.

The season definitely got better as it went along and the many plot threads began to connect.

As always, Bree and Lynette get the most interesting storylines. Gabby didn't annoy me this season as much as she has in the past. She was crucial in the outcome of the Bolen storyline, which took a very interesting turn at the last moment. I loved it!

The Xmas episode is this season's attempt at the annual ""disaster/crisis"" episode. This year we get a plane crash. Of course, the best part about these almost-annual ""disaster"" episodes is how it changes the course of the plot and the after-effects on certain characters, and this season is no exception. I particularly liked how it got Angie off the hook with her blackmailer and put Lynette back in Gabby and Carlos' good graces.

One of my favorite aspects of this show is the fantastic casting of the female guest stars. Past seasons have included turns by great ladies of Hollywood's past (Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin, Polly Bergin), amazing talent from other TV classics (Dixie Carter, Laurie Metcalf, Frances Conroy) and underused or forgotten gems (Celia Weston, Lesley Boone, Valerie Mahaffey). Though there was less of it this year, in the finale we get an unrecognizable Patty McCormack (""The Bad Seed"") looking uncannily like Louise Latham.

We get to see what the child actors who originally played the Scavo boys during Seasons 1-4 look like now during a brief clip and another former resident of Wisteria Lane makes a surprise return in the finale.

I didn't care for the unneccesary overuse use of the ""P"" word every time a character expressed how angry they were. Writers, please keep it clean--this isn't a cable show. While that kind of language is becoming more prevalent in society, the show would be much classier without it.

Though it took a while to get things cooking, this season was much better than Season 5. The last four episodes are amazing, once the strangler is revealed (he reminds me of a young Alice Cooper).

The bonus features include the usual bloopers, some short interviews with Marc Cherry, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman and Doug Savant, about a half-dozen deleted scenes, and Cherry's commentary on his favorite scenes this season.",1285459200,,4136,4.7395543175487465
4118246,4,B003F3NDP8,"""Desperate Housewives"", the popular ABC drama series (created by Marc Cherry, ""The Golden Girls"", ""The Golden Palace"", ""Amas de casa despesperadas"") which started back in 2004 definitely has gone through some major ups and downs with its dark comedy storylines to its complex marriage or relationship problems but if there is one thing definite about the series... its that the the fans love it and to keep the fans interested, the series went through a significant change for its fifth season.

""Desperate Housewives"" is a series that had so many complex storylines that to even explain what has happened in the last four seasons would be difficult but if there is one thing that remains the same, it's our housewives.

The premise of the first season was based around the death of fellow housewife Mary Alice Young (played by Brenda Strong, ""Everwood"", ""The Help"", ""A Plumm Summer""). Mary Alice Young is the narrator of the series and every episode, she has setup the sequences of what is going on in the life of her friends. And its the housewives of Wisteria Lane who have lived complex lives full of love, betrayal, pain and sadness.

For the sixth season of ""Desperate Housewives"", the housewives have new problems this time around.  Susan has married her second husband Mike, once again, but Katherine is not taking it quite well.  Bree is having an affair with Susan's first ex-husband behind her current husband, Orson's back.  Lynette is doing fantastic at her new career working for Carlos but as she is making her career dreams come true, now she and Tom face a new challenge as she is pregnant with twins.  As for Gabrielle, life as a mother is difficult, especially now that she has to watch over Carlos' teenage niece Ana but to make things even more complicated, a former flame comes back and she also has to deal with the pressures of being a parent.  We are also introduced to a new family who has moved into the neighborhood and a new housewife named Angie who has a major secret.  Meanwhile, a serial killer is on the loose and his victims hit the housewives of Wisteria Lane pretty hard.

VIDEO:

""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions. ""Desperate Housewives"" looks very good on DVD. Outdoor scenes are nice and vibrant, blacks and low-light scenes do not have the excessive noise problems that some series tend to exhibit on a DVD release.

For the most part, cinematography for ""Desperate Housewives"" has been excellent and the editing top notch. The series looks great and I can only imagine how beautiful this series would look on High Definition (via Blu-ray).

AUDIO:

""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and pretty much, ""Desperate Housewives"" has always been a dialogue-driven television show and is primarily front and center channel driven. For the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable. The show uses minimal music and nor is it the kind of series that utilizes a lot of sound effects (the final episode has a little). For the most part, the setting I preferred to watch the series was to set my receiver setting and have stereo on all channels.

The series includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and in French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Last season, I felt that the ""Desperate Housewives"" reboot was necessary in establishing a new beginning for the Housewives.  As each housewife deals with becoming parents and the story now benefiting from the five year advance, I felt that creator Marc Cherry did what he can to help jumpstart the series.

Season four had the housewives dealing with a tornado, season five dealt with a new beginning for the housewives and now season six continues that storyline of the housewives learning about parenthood, others dealing with new loves, lost love and this time, with a new mysterious family moving to the neighborhood.  To make things even more crazy, there is a strangler on the loose and people are now ending up dead.

I felt with the reboot last season, ""Desperate Housewives"" has a new fresh start and I liked how they had the storyline of Susan and Mike together (these two deserve each other and I can't see them with anyone else) but we also got that creepy feeling with Katherine going a bit crazy when she loses Mike and is unable to cope with the loss that well.

Last season, the relationship between both Gabrielle and her daughters were hilarious to watch.  To watch Gabrielle and her daughters together is just fun to watch because she's not exactly sure how to be a good mother and her kids, especially little Juanita is also fun to watch as she has Gabrielle's attitude.  And the addition of Ana proves to be quite interesting as Gabrielle kind of sees herself in the teenager.  And as the rambunctious children of Lynette were always focused on in the first two seasons, it was great to see Gabrielle and Susan have these parenting contests against each other.

As for Tom and Lynette, we tend to see how the couple has faced various challenges throughout the years and we have seen how Lynette had wanted to get back into a career and now she is very successful until she gets pregnant again and now scared to find out what would happen if Carlos finds out.  Especially since Carlos depends on her daily presence and even moreso as he promotes her to VP.

And as for Bree, less focus on the actual business and more is focus on her infidelity with Karl, her relationship with Orson and finding out that her dead husband Rex has another child.

Throw in another housewife who has her own set of skeletons in her closet and you have yourself an enjoyable sixth season of ""Desperate Houswives"".

Saying anything more will spoil the series but I feel that those who were attracted to the dark but yet enjoyable and fun storyline of the first season, can find enjoyment with the sixth season. For the most part, I enjoyed the sixth season but I have to admit that I was expecting a little more from the strangler storyline (since the first episode kicked off with it) and something a bit more dark and sinister but for what it's worth, the way they ended things was OK.

Especially with the Bolen storyline, at first it seemed that there was something rather significant and I liked how the storyline went, but somehow the urgency started to dissipate and I felt that the way the series ended with the family was fine.

Usually, for ""Desperate Housewives"", I'm used to seeing a finale that is quite explosive or shocking but this year, it was an average season finale but for the whole season, I actually enjoyed this season.  The storylines were highly entertaining, I liked how the writers utilized the supporting characters such as Mrs. McClusky, Roy, Lee, Bob, Julie, Ana, Robin, Lynette's kids, etc. and incorporated them to the episodes and once again, I enjoyed each episode a lot.  It's just that if people were expecting something shocking and something that would have them in awe, the shock factor wasn't tremendous but it was good.  If anything, I felt that the buildup to the plane crash episode was more surprising but it will be interesting to see what the writers have in store for season seven.

As for ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"", the DVD set is a pretty solid release. I wish there was audio commentary for certain episodes like last year but there are none with this latest season DVD box set. But for the most part, you do get a few entertaining special features included and overall, it's another solid ""Desperate Housewives"" DVD release.

If you are a fan of ""Desperate Housewives"", then ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"" is definitely recommended!",1285286400,,8997,4.824104234527687

4118250,3,B003F3NDP8,"Desperate Housewives has been one of my favorite shows to ever hit television since it debuted in 2005. Season 5 was probably the weakest in my opinion although it did feature some extraordinary episodes luckily Season 6 is an improvement. There is good and bad in this season. The new family is pretty interesting however I feel a lot of the storylines were recycled much like season 5 and the show ultimately suffers without Nicolette Sheridans character Edie. The actresses are likely the best of tv especially Marcia Cross, Felicity Hoffman, and Eva Longoria they all truly shine but without the fire and ice of Nicolette Sheridan there is no confrontation and crack up moments between the ladies and its a shame since Sheridans character brought a much needed and appreciated brutal honesty to the series. Still a good season not great though but better than season 5 and hopefully season 7 will bring us back to the housewives we love and get them back on top so we don't have to bury this series too soon.",1283040000,2,1012,4.72316384180791
4118251,3,B003F3NDP8,"All things hit their peaks and then start sliding downwards. My personal guess is that they probably should have ended this show with Edie's death. What we seem to be doing in this season is just dealing with ongoing ""more of the same"" in the neighborhood. The characters have all had their days in the sun and are well past those days. There have been some new characters added but they haven't really added anything to the show. It seems as if they are trying to breathe some new life into this but they can't. Drea Matteo from the SOPRANOS is one of these. Hers is basically a one note performance of someone hiding out in the neighborhood from criminal mistakes in her past. Another is the stripper with the heart of gold (I wish I were making this up). I wish Mike and Susan had stayed divorced. The two of them now irritate me constantly. Terri Hatcher has become positively grating. The last best story arc this show had was Dave, the neighbor, married to Edie, who was trying to kill Mike and then Susan for killing his wife and child in an auto collision. When that arc of the story ended, last season, the air just went out of this whole thing. Tom and Lynette are now having yet another baby and it isn't doing a thing for me. That couple has completely lost their drift. I enjoyed Gabby more when she was plotting against her mother in law and having it off with the teenage boyfriend, not to mention trying to jump start her haute couture career again. Bree and Orson are now beyond soap opera cliche with him in a wheelchair. I think this show needed to keep a few ""evil"" characters, like Edie and Gabby, the way she used to be, and Dave. Now everyone is kind of a nice person with the usual suburban problems and it is boring. Every series runs out of gas eventually and I believe this is one of them. I must add to this that I don't think all of these series shows taking long hiatuses this winter, for virtually all of December and February, did them any favors. What little momentum they had was lost in two months of absences.

4118253,5,B003F3NDP8,"An excellent comeback from what Season 5 was. Susan and Mike are finally back together (let's hope it stays that way), Angie Bolen and her family are a much needed relief after Dave Williams and his mystery.  They added something unique to the show, but I'm glad they only stayed a season.  Even though the show isn't the same without Edie, it is beginning to be what it was in its early days again, and Season 7 will certainly see a continuation in this trend.",1281744000,3,461,4.411764705882353
4118264,5,B003F3NDP8,"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season is definitely a solid and enjoyable season. The thing about Desperate Housewives, the first half of the season is always stronger than the last half. I am not really sure why that is but I still think this campy show is loads of fun! I loved the unexpected chemistry between Bree and Carl, too bad things didn't end well for one them! I also liked the storyline with that sensitive but deeply troubled, Eddie. The way Lynnette took him under his wing was quite moving even though she couldn't save him from hurting others in the process. But the one storyline that I thought was quite strange was the emotional collapse of Katherine, parts were good and others were a head-scratcher. Overall, season 6 turned out to be better than I could've hoped for. Can't wait for Season 7!",1281312000,,825,4.696551724137931
4118265,2,B003F3NDP8,"Season five was spotty, but turned out okay in the end. But this season finally fell apart. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. The season's mystery is boring and protracted, the housewives are grating, and Dana Delaney is desperately under-served.",1279584000,4,261,5.093023255813954
4118266,4,B003F3NDP8,"Desperate Housewives continued on its downward spiral during this sixth season. Ratings dwindled and the writers made the same mistakes during seasons two and three. The show became about six different shows, with the housewives living in their isolated plot lines. Rarely did two housewives overlap story-wise, or even cross paths for that matter. The special bond these women share was sorely missed this season. What's perhaps more upsetting is the way the season's central mystery, Angie Bolen and her family, was treated. Since season four, the mysteries have been easily solved by viewers within the first few episodes. Season six was different, but not because it was as complex as earlier mysteries, but because we were left completely in the dark. For the entire first half of the season, not one clue about this family was revealed. Instead, we were distracted with a sub-mystery about a serial strangler. (Though it appeared the two were connected, they weren't.) Then, by the middle of the season, it was clear that Angie was a terrorist and was on the run from a man named Patrick Logan. Bam, mystery solved (save for a few minor details) with half a season to go! And, I might mention, in that second half of the season, the show's darkness is consumed by sitcom-esque comedy.

Of course, that's all the negative qualities about the season. There are positive attributes. For example, the first half of the season was deliciously dark, something that had been missing during season five. As mentioned, the Bolen mystery was unsolvable due to lack of clues in the first half. While this isn't exactly a good thing, it's preferable to being able to solve the mystery three episodes in. Katherine's (Dana Delany) descent into a nervous breakdown was probably the highlight of the season. It was both funny, captivating, and dramatic. Bree's afair, Susan's quest to identify the town strangler, and Lynette and Gabrielle's feud were also excellent storylines.

Overall, the season was probably the show's worst (yes, even worse than season five). The characters were isolated, the mystery was straight-forward, and the tone shifted to light comedy halfway through. That said, this is still entertaining television. If you have all or most of the other seasons on DVD, I recommend adding this to your collection. It's a must for all DH fans!",1277942400,4,2350,5.023076923076923

4118268,3,B003F3NDP8,"I've been waiting for this to come out so I can see the show in sequence.  The haphazard way that ABC ran this season was a major disappointment especially with all the breaks of a month in between episodes and reruns before the season was completed.  I recommend getting it on DVD which is why I gave up watching it because it was difficult to follow.  If ABC is trying to lose viewers, which they probably have, they did a great job with this series.

I only gave it three stars because the writing wasn't as good as previous seasons.  Besides the erratic broadcasting, the stories were weak compared to previous seasons and the serial killer story dragged on too long.  Of course ABC dragging on with the breaks in between episodes didn't help either.  The quality in Season Six compared to previous seasons was not up to par.  I think the series is losing steam.",1276560000,2,866,4.506410256410256
4118269,4,B003F3NDP8,"""Desperate Housewives"" is not a brilliant television drama by any stretch of the imagination, but it's fun and I enjoy it. Season 6 has its ups and downs, and although I think many of the main storylines are rather weak, they are compensated by the overall humor of this show, which I find hysterical and is the only reason I still watch regularly. Also, this season features Drea de Matteo as the new ""mysterious neighbor"" on Wisteria Lane. I loved Drea on ""The Sopranos"" and thought she added a lot to this series as well.

I didn't think the cliffhanger was that exciting this season, especially compared to years past, but I still will be tuning in when ""Desperate Housewives"" returns in the fall.",1276300800,2,701,4.653225806451613

Season five was okay.... now we are presented with a season full of recycled storylines (mysterious neighbor with checkered past moves in, things aren't what they seem).. yadda yadda yadda... I can't help but think the writers should have packed it up last season.  I have struggled to watch this on my DVR.  Every week I say ""Okay, I'll catch up on all the episodes"" and every week I try to and the show just isn't funny or entertaining any longer.",1272931200,6,557,4.653061224489796

Susan and Mike date other people, ruining their lives in one way or another (emotionally breaking hearts, getting engaged, breaking off engagements, etc...) THEN....(bated breath)...Susan and Mike get back together again.

The first season I felt was new and interesting until I realized it's just, like others have said, a prime time soap opera. I cruised through the channels the other day and came across the Spanish channel. Without having to speak the language I KNEW it was their remake of one of Desperate Housewives earlier episodes..you know the one where Susan happens to be locked out of her house naked and the object of her desire plumber/ex-con Mike happens to just show up the moment she tumbles into the bushes. I digress...they are all conniving, manipulative, indecisive, witches of Wisteria, who don't know what they have or appreciate their loved one's unless their is peril, death, or adultery involved. All I want to do is tell most of them to grow up...but what is worse is they are all well old enough to know better. Like many of the other akin lineup programming, everyone seemingly just sleeps with everyone or there is one unbelievably, but avoidable, extraordinary dilemma atop another at every turn. Gratuitous nudity, flirting, and ""keep to themselves"" neighbors don't really thicken a plot. Drown in it already and end this series.",1272326400,4,1419,5.064102564102564
