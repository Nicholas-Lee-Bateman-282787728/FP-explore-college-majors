I found that working though the DVD was simple to execute but more fun because of the interaction and solid writing/acting.  Nothing was too heavy handed and there wasn't a downtrodden feel to the video that many videos of similar topics have (""all the biodiversity is ruined, no one is healthy, unless you plant a tree every day we'll all be gone in 5 years"" type of notion.).  Generally I found the DVD to be a fun and enlightening experience perfect for middle school and high school students.  It works especially well in a classroom where the most interested students can get the most of the information while still fitting the video into one lesson.  High production values and good content, a great find.",1232496000,,861,4.66887417218543
8603125,4,B000ICLRZW,"I just watched this interactive DVD and thought it was a great change from the usual educational movies I watch in like Biology Class. Young actors using pretty easy to understand info instead of a ton of huge and difficult words like; ""..and as you partake this vile exercise to produce your hypo sensitive seedlings you meander to said wheelbarrow..."" and on like that, which, if your a high schooler like me, can be very confusing. The only small down side is the menu system is a little confusing. Besides that i give it 4 stars.",1202169600,,533,4.5625
