4464274,4,B004SQFQHO,"Rules for Radicals author Alinsky actually conversed with Buckley and  didn't sound like a demon, but more thoughtful and reasonable. His background and education  has given him the ability to  turn minds left. I'm glad I still had this interview on my list.. See how guilelessly he works here.",1367107200,2,294,4.959183673469388
4464275,5,B004SQFQHO,"These episodes of Firing Line are a pleasure to watch.  Interesting discussions and well debated!  Highly recommend watching them, most of the topics are still relevant.",1364083200,2,169,5.461538461538462
4464276,4,B004SQFQHO,"The video was intriguing.  However, Alinsky managed to generally keep his intentions veiled, though Buckley tries to extract admissions and disclosures from Alinsky.  Interesting to watch a man who wrote ""Rules for Radicals"" express himself, disclose hints of his mission(s), and dodge the sharp inquiry of Buckley.  I wish Buckley had been more successful in getting some genuine admissions out of Alinsky as to Alinsky's intentions in mobilizing the poor, beyond the soft answer of helping the poor get what they need by grouping themselves together for a bulk gripe and serious rabble rousing.",1361664000,3,596,5.319148936170213
4464277,3,B004SQFQHO,"Both the topic and the audio were difficult for me.  As to be expected, the interviewer and ee go round and round with very little middle ground.  There are vague allusions to being in the trenches being more Christ-like that the Christians who refuse to go there.  I guess that's nothing new.  Saul is so quiet at times as to be inaudible.  Worth watching if you have an immediate stake in the poor and are willing to do something.  Otherwise, quite painful.",1360454400,4,459,4.536585365853658
4464278,5,B004SQFQHO,"Mr. Alinsky would be proud of his student, Barack Obama.....he learned the master's approach to redistritution as you gain power over the supposedly ""served"" electorate.",1355356800,7,169,5.8
4464279,5,B004SQFQHO,It was a good recording of Alinsky and his views.  It does not get into the nitty gritty but it does give the viewer an idea of his thoughts.  He does try to slip past Buckley but is not quite able to.  You can note his marxist aethiest views.,1353542400,9,243,3.9183673469387754
8440081,5,B004SQFQHO,"A very interesting discussion between Buckley and Alinsky.  The Firing Lines takes us back to a time when men on the opposite ends of the political spectrum could still be civil with one another.  That is not to say that there is not open conflict, just that it is couched in Buckley's use of wit rather than rancor.  I've watched several of these and really enjoyed the humor found in the brilliant use of language.  You can stream many old episodes of Firing Line if you have Amazon Prime.  I highly recommend watching these.  I may have some advantage in that, while I was very young when Buckley was at his prime, I do know something of the political context, which makes them all the more enjoyable.  I think however that even without that context one should be able to see the cracks in the body politic of the day which now threaten to turn this nation into political rubble.",1458000000,,882,4.475

8440086,5,B004SQFQHO,Outstanding! Buckley was a master of the English language and a disarming interviewer. To get Saul Alinsky to be so open and engaging shows Buckley at his finest.,1405296000,2,162,4.821428571428571
8440087,4,B004SQFQHO,IT WS GRT TO SEE SAUL ALINSKY AGAIN & W BUCKLY 2 OPPOSITES BOTH BRILIANT,1405123200,,72,3.8666666666666667
8440088,3,B004SQFQHO,"I started watching Mr. Buckley around 1962.  His quirks and mannerisms were always entertaining to me.  He was an intelligent man, an expert debater on any subject, and an avid blue water sailor who wrote several books on that subject.  This Firing Line episode was with a young Saul Alinsky who I find despicable today and therefore cannot recommend it.  I would recommend Bill Buckleys interview with Britains first lady Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as a better alternative.",1401494400,,480,5.115384615384615
8440089,4,B004SQFQHO,"It's unfortunate that Alinsky chose to be evasive, and successfully so, in this rare encounter. It was typical of WFB to be thoroughly prepared and armed with quotes and references when interviewing an adversary or an ally. But in this case Alinsky spent too much time denying statements attributed to him and too little time explaining his views. That in itself was revelatory of the man's methods, however.

He knew his methods and cynical philosophy (also denied) wouldn't win points in a debate with a man who probably had the moral high ground - or at least had a more positive view of America and Americans. So Alinsky chose (as many leftists do) to be obtuse regarding specifics and evasive in general. It's always a good rule of thumb to be distrustful of anyone who over-complicates an argument or who parries rather than engages an opponent in debate. They're hiding something.

Alinsky, however, cannot hide what he's worked so hard to create: A social-Darwinist approach to power in America. He was an unapologetic Machiavellian who wore ""social injustice"" on his sleeve right below ""the ends justify the means."" Like it or not, he had more in common with the tyrants of history (Stalin, Hitler, Mao, etc.,) than any of the great leaders or thinkers we refer to when facing social or governmental dilemmas. His choice was to discard civility (possibly his humanity) in order to win the day. And his methods were and are effective today, and quite probably will win again. But the question is: ""Is it worth it?""

I say no, and that your opinion of Alinsky will reveal your own character. Thank you, WFB, for your great works.",1382832000,14,1636,4.814946619217082
8440090,3,B004SQFQHO,"I was disappointed in Buckley's performance...he seemed nervous, overwrought. I've enthusiastically read many of his books, watched his program, Firing Line (every week for thirty years, over 1500 programs!), read the magazine he founded and edited (National Review, now just awful) -- for free in libraries (always a lefty, I never paid) -- which once had wonderful writers (one of whom, Garry Wills, is now a prominent Catholic man of the left.)
  Alinsky is a vaguely amused, cool cat, a mongoose; Buckley, serpentine, out of control. The program was filmed at St. John's university in New York -- a liberal, Catholic bastion. Sadly, Buckley, a conservative intellectual, almost aristocratic, a type now, powerless, almost non-existent, is a dated figure. Alinsky and his ideas -- not widely known in his time -- still live.",1380585600,,827,5.2105263157894735
