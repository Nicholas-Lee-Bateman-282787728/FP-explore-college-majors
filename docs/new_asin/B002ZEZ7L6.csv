4017585,5,B002ZEZ7L6,"I LOVE this DVD.  I purchased through Amazon for $25.95, which included S&H.  To me, it's worth EVERY penny!  This couple shares how they once were in poor health but got on the right track with the stretches they now do daily.  The husband, overcame a serious medical condition. The wife followed making healthier lifestyle choices too.  Their story is truly inspiring.  I believe stretching CAN make a huge difference when it comes to controlling/decreasing pain and our overall health.  I have NEVER found a stretching DVD that I like as much as this one. I actually look forward to doing it every day! :)

GO SLOW and be careful with the neck stretch/exercise towards the end of video.  I pulled a muscle in my shoulder while doing this one but not because of the exercise/stretch itself but what I was trying to do with my hair during the exercise.  (hair clip dragging on floor - and did not sit up properly to adjust my hair, so in doing this while still laying on the floor, I ended up pulling a muscle.)  GREAT exercise to strengthen the neck muscles.  Just be sure to go slow and listen to your body and rest in between when needed.  Good Luck!!",1380758400,3,1155,4.4951923076923075
4017586,5,B002ZEZ7L6,Fantastic stretch. Doesn't take long. Once you get the routine down you can do it anywhere!  Jacques' story is very inspiring too.,1367798400,4,130,4.909090909090909
4017587,3,B002ZEZ7L6,This video is charming but very dated.  I don't believe it is worth the price.  I do love the French accents though.,1365292800,3,116,4.2272727272727275
4017588,5,B002ZEZ7L6,My wife and I have been doing these stretches for over a year and love the benefits. Jacques and Dorothy tell an inspiring story and gently guide the viewer through a series of easy exercises. Highly recommended,1259884800,11,211,4.72972972972973
8384718,5,B002ZEZ7L6,"This is an excellent video!  First, the routine is simple and easy to follow and very effective.  Second, the couple who made it tell an amazing personal story. Their testimony of the effectiveness of stretching properly changed a life threatening condition, which also made the video very encouraging for someone dealing with chronic back or joint pain, like myself.  I feel the DVD is worth every penny of the price it went for.  If someone were to follow the routine regularly it would certainly save some money on doctor bills. It saved me some, though I tend not to stretch regularly. But when some back trouble comes or pinched nerve trouble starts I do some of the stretching exercises and drink more water; in a matter of days the trouble goes away instead of getting worse which is different than some of my prior experiences.  A few people wrote low reviews, but they maybe they are like the ones who believe everyone except themselves are paid too much for goods and services.  Personally, I care more about how things are made and who benefits instead of what's the cheapest price something can be had for.",1469577600,,1118,4.707692307692308
8384719,4,B002ZEZ7L6,Pretty much every part of your body is stretched. Quite encouraging coaching.,1431907200,,77,5.5

8384721,5,B002ZEZ7L6,Very easy to follow stretching exercises.. absolutely love it.,1406937600,,62,6.0
8384722,5,B002ZEZ7L6,If you do these faithfully you will have a lot less pain or no pain! I have bought this tape three times so far and have given to others that found it to be great!,1404518400,,163,3.6857142857142855
8384723,2,B002ZEZ7L6,"This did not meet my expectations.  Having been a physical therapist in the past, expected a more comprehensive approach.  This video was not done by trained professionals.",1403222400,,172,5.333333333333333
8384724,5,B002ZEZ7L6,"I give this FIVE stars, because I think it is utterly amazing.  They recommend doing the stretches every day, and though I have months when I do that, more often I just do them once a week and...I'm very serious...all my back, hip, and neck pain go away and stay away.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's been life-changing for me.  This will keep you away from the chiropractor.

This last winter, I felt heroic and shoveled a neighbor's driveway without warming up.  By evening, my shoulder muscles were tightening up and hurting, and I knew I had done something I shouldn't with my back.  When I woke the next morning, it was worse.  I worked through this DVD once, and it all went away, and I could move normally the rest of the day.  It was like I had never shoveled snow...much nicer than taking Tylenol and sitting in a chair reading for three days or so.

I also love Jacques and Dorothee!  They feel like friends now, with their gentle words and ways.  When I put in the DVD, I'm never dreading doing this, but looking forward to stretching out and unwinding with friends at the end of a day.  I generally do these right before bed, and sleep very relaxed and feeling great throughout my body.",1396915200,3,1209,4.4409090909090905
8384725,5,B002ZEZ7L6,This guided video is the first one where I have been able to follow along and actually do the exercises. That alone is worth the price not to mention the money I've wasted on dvd's I can't follow. The pace is relaxing and helps counter stress.  The fact that the instructors don't look like supermodels is reassuring. I like that I can do these exercises in the morning for energy and in the evening for relaxation. The whole point is to do them slow and mindfully. If you find that you are growing impatient with the slow pace then you probably need the de-stressing component the most. Relax. Breathe. Enjoy.,1395014400,3,610,4.545454545454546
8384726,2,B002ZEZ7L6,"There are 15 stretches here done in a boring atmosphere. The stretches are good, but they are a part of every workout I've ever done. This is a $30 item! Seriously?! I would've maybe paid around $8 and still felt ripped off but wouldn't have returned it for a refund. Seriously, his story is inspiring but you can read it for free online, but to charge this much money for a DVD that lasts 30 minutes and has nothing different in it? No...Returned immediately.",1394668800,,460,4.488095238095238
8384727,5,B002ZEZ7L6,I use the stretching techniques from this DVD just about everyday. I have more flexibility and I find it very relaxing to do. Jacques and Dorothee are easy to follow and relatable. I don't think the stretching in this DVD will irrevocably change life but overall life is better for me with it.,1392854400,2,293,4.547169811320755
