7725767,5,B01DX0NCXU,Picture and sound quality are inspiring.  This is my new show-off disk.,1468972800,,71,4.916666666666667
7725768,5,B01DX0NCXU,"Bought this Blu-Ray DVD directly from the producer, but it's the same as what Amazon sells.  I first saw this film at an IMAX theater a few years ago, and have been anxiously waiting ever since for it to be released on DVD.  It would have been nice for them to produce a regular DVD version as well as a Blu-Ray, but I can understand their reasons for not wanting to cheapen the experience by downgrading the quality to regular DVD, so no big deal there in the grand scheme of things.  All in all, this is a wonderful video!  Stellar cinematography, awesome audio (though sometimes the audio during helicopter shots aren't quite in sync with the engine chuffs, but it takes a real rail buff to see that), and a great story to boot!  One can almost smell the hot valve oil and oil smoke from the engine as it passes by.  I only wish it were a longer video, but the IMAX movies tend to be limited to only 45 minutes.  But, oh what a wonderful 45 minutes of storytelling and awesomeness it is!  We especially enjoyed the excellent use of the surround sound which immersed us in the action as the engine and train went by.

My only complaint is the special features.  One is a cartoon of Canadian transportation in the 50's, of which mostly is cartoonish animation without much point.  Don't bother with this cartoon special feature.  The other is a promotional propaganda film of railroaders in the 50's along the same areas as Rocky Mountain Express was filmed at.  This one is good (though quite staged, which was typical of the era).  What would have been much more interesting to me (as a railroad fan) is to have a special feature on the making of the Rocky Mountain Express, more behind the scenes video, etc.",1468800000,5,1712,4.463022508038585
7725769,3,B01DX0NCXU,"The black levels on this are bad. I have an HDR OLED and it's a gray mess. When the train goes into tunnels the whole screen becomes grey instead of pitch black. Pretty disappointed on the mastering, good thing I rented it.

And what pisses me off even worse is that the SDR version (which is on the same disk) does not have this problem. When trains go inside tunnels the black is black. How could they screw up so badly that the SDR version has better blacks than the HDR one? I would sure like to have a chat with the colorist.",1468713600,2,530,4.145631067961165
7725770,5,B01DX0NCXU,"Excellent film! Ridiculously EPIC train scenes! Engaging story. Most of the music is terrific, even haunting!

The sound though... I have a nice 7.1 setup (sadly no Dolby Atmos) paired with a 120"" projection screen. With the volume turned up to just past full reference level... You! Are! THERE!!! The engine sounds are incredible and heavy, with crisp vivid and detailed layers of steamy metallic sounds mixed with thick solid weighty deep lows. This is quite literally the closest you can possibly get to a real steam locomotive without actually being there! There are a few memorable shots where the camera is placed above the wheels, or next to the pushrods, or mounted right on the side of the boiler that sound the best. The latter of those in particular (again with the sound cranked): as the train is racing through a forest-flanked track, you definitely feel like you're hanging on to that boiler and riding along! Even the credits and final 10 seconds of the film are a sonic delight!

The main complaint I have with the film is that this would have been super spectacular in 3D!!! The fact that it wasn't filmed as such (when most other Stephen Low 'IMAXers' are) is both perplexing and disappointing. Other complaints would be that not unlike other Stephen Low 'IMAXers', some minor editing choices seem a bit questionable, and I didn't care much for that one jazzy song... But these complaints are minor (and the '500 Miles' song and sequence mooore than makes up for that jazzy bit), and neither detract from the overall viewing experience nor from my 5 star rating for the film! Do yourself a favor and GET THIS FILM!",1468454400,13,1632,4.763250883392226
7725771,5,B01DX0NCXU,Just awesome IMAX film if you enjoy the golden age of railroading this movie is a must,1468368000,,86,4.117647058823529
7725772,5,B01DX0NCXU,"The 4K UHD and Dolby Atmos on this disc is the best I've seen/heard yet. If you're a rail fan you need to buy this. Put's you right in/on the engine with some of the best shots I've ever seen in a train film. I'm fortunate to have an Atmos system and when I cranked it up, it was just like sitting in the cab or standing on the platform when a steam engine train arrives. If you're not a rail fan you need to buy this for the history, scenery and all around entertainment. Unfortunately, as with most IMAX films, it's only 45 minutes long. Shame.",1468368000,26,546,4.11214953271028

7725775,5,B01DX0NCXU,"A very well done documentary on building a railroad across the Canadian Rockies describing the hardships & obstacles they encountered along the way. The film crew did a great job putting it all together with the great scenery. Anyone who is interested in railroads should like this one. Also, in the special features, they have actual 1950's footage on the operation of the railroad. I was so impressed by it, that I ordered another for my Brother.",1523664000,,448,4.8311688311688314

7725784,5,B01DX0NCXU,"I'm not even a train buff but I really enjoyed this. The image quality was great. You could really see all the scratches, dents, grease, and other little details on the train parts. And, of course, the Rocky Mountain scenery was gorgeous. The sound quality was great too! We have a surround sound system with a 4K receiver and this film really took advantage of it. The train whistle, the engine, the steam puffing, the track vibration ... all that sound really filled the room!

The disc asks you whether to play it in HDR or 'Standard' mode.

In my haste, I accidentally pushed 'Standard,' watched the whole thing, and was impressed.
Later, it occurred to me that I should go back and compare the HDR version,
and oh my! My appraisal went from ""Very good"" to ""OMG! This is stunning!""

In a nutshell, 4K is a big step forward, but HDR is (in my opinion) an even bigger step
forward, re. a gorgeous, life-like picture. For those about to buy a 4K TV, make sure it has HDR

7725854,5,B01DX0NCXU,"So I am a budding train nut, having been interested in them as a kid, and then more recently re-discovered them when it was suggested by my fianc that we put up a train around our Christmas Tree.  As I do with all of my hobbies, I have gotten way into it, which has resulted in spilling over into real trains.  I'm not quite a rail-fan level yet, but I do try to drive home past our local yard when I can, and rubberneck when we are in new towns and go by a train or yard.  So obviously this is a film that would be up my alley.

But it goes beyond that.  Its a great story about a time of HUGE dreams and major risks, that all take their human toll.  And the way the story is laid out, and the film is put together is just top notch.  All the different camera angles that are on the trains give you the sense of speed and power that the old steamers had.  Those and the shots from around the train in the air, using the amazing natural scenery as a back drop, and honestly a main character of the story, combined with unique and perfect music choices all make for an experience that grabs and holds your attention.  I literally watched it on the edge of my seat the first time (no big surprise there, I'm a dork).  The 2nd time I watched it was with my parents and fianc.  They were all captivated.  My parents are retired and are looking into a train trip through Canada now as a result!

I am a bit of an audio nut, too.  My friends would say that's an understatement, though.  From a technical standpoint, the audio was amazing.  It was well balanced, and mixed by somebody who knows what they were doing.  The lows were present and focused, but not overpowering.  Just enough so you could really sense the train in front of you.  From a video perspective, this was my first 4k title to purchase.  I am not as much of a videophile as an audio one, but it does look great.  The details and color are awesome.  I went a little cheap on my 4k tv, though, so it doesn't have HDR, so really I'm probably not the best person to comment on the video quality.

Ultimately if you are on the fence about buying this, don't be. Just get it and enjoy!",1489536000,7,2143,4.110843373493976

As other reviewers have said this is MOST enjoyable to those who are interested in trains, especially steam driven trains.
A couple of diesel/electrics were slipped in there simply to facilitate the telling of the story visually.
The scenery is remarkable.
The story of the building of the railway is interesting and could confirm that ANYTHING is possible given enough MONEY and a strong enough WILL.
The scenery is breathtaking after viewing one wonders IF 3D could really enhance it.
This is a high definition video (not a 4K), the detail and color is at the top end of the 1080P technology so that it seems almost 3D at times.
The 4K version contains the 3D video but my system will only play 1080P (HD) so I COULOD have watched the 3D part but not the 4K part.

Every time one of the scenes with the train popped up, he gasped ""train!"" It's nice to know that I can grab his interest with a real depiction of something; not just a cartoon.

If I could change one thing it would be to simply attach a camera to the front of the train and just let it run for about an hour while it occasionally pans to the left or right.

7725901,5,B01DX0NCXU,"20 years ago my young son and I used to ride our bikes down to the train station in our little California town of Moorpark.  We would wait to watch for the freight trains come through as they rumbled through the station.  Sometimes on a rare occasion an old steam engine would come through.
He had g-scale trains and an electronic sound station train whistle played through our sound system. His older sister did not like that one bit!
We had lots of train videos and watched them frequently.  Today he is grown and I am an old guy, but I love technology.
I saw this video and I had to have it to view with my son on our LG UHD TV through our nice sound system.  I bought the 4k version that comes with a regular blu ray.  I found out the hard way that my Sony and Samsung 4k upconverting blu ray players will not play the 4k disk.  I was disappointed, but the blu ray was beautiful with great sound.  So when the actual 4k players become more reasonable price wise, I'll get one. The history lesson and beautiful scenery was worth it!
Update:  9-10..I finally bought my 4k player and it is certainly worth it.  Everything is  crystal clear and the sound is incredible.  I can't understand any of the less than 5 reviews.  If you don't like trains, buy it for demonstration purposes!  The price has come way down too for the player and this documentary .",1471824000,24,1354,4.304347826086956
