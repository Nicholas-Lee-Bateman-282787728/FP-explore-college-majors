3804846,4,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning is a movie about ordinary people, trying to make their lives work out in a difficult world.  Rose (Amy Adams) is a single mom of a precocious 8 year old.  She was the head cheerleader in high school, but now her life has taken a turn for the worse, and she's cleaning houses to make ends meet.  Her sister Nora (Emily Blunt) is a wild child who is always losing her jobs because she isn't reliable.  Rose gets a tip from her boyfriend that there is money to be made in cleaning up crime scenes, and the sisters set up their own business.  Alan Arkin also stars as the girls eccentric father.

This movie was touching and a little bit sad--in the way that real life movies often are--with just enough sunshine around the edges to keep it from being depressing.  I think the two women were superb, they did a great job of capturing the emotions wrapped up in these women's difficult lives.  It wasn't depressing, but it was a movie you can really get emotionally involved with.

I would recommend this film to someone looking for a good art-house type movie with interesting characters.  It's also a good film for fans of Amy Adams and Emily Blunt to see them both do something completely different--this movie definitely shows off the talent of both actresses.",1238803200,,1277,4.56140350877193
3804847,4,B001UV4XHE,"This movie isn't my usual style, but charmed me anyway. A struggling young mother tries to get ahead in the world. One problem is that she's surrounded by former high school classmates who've already done so, and she's their house-cleaner. Another problem is that she never had a role model. Her father keeps trying to get ahead with one gray-market deal or another, and keeps not doing it. Yet another is her sister ... but Rose keeps trying anyway. And, in her way, making it.

Although this has no relation to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Miss-Sunshine/dp/B000K7VHQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Miss Sunshine</a>, the two movies have much of the same spirit. In each, a dysfunctional family on the verge of economic collapse does its inept best for one of their own. In each, pure dogged repetition of self-motivational messages takes the place of any real reward from the world around them. In each, the ones with just a little share it with those who have nothing at all. And, in each, the hard work does pay off in the end.

A few things didn't quite make it for me in this movie. Rose's isolation and friendlessness in her life-long home town doesn't quite fit, for example. Norah's miscarried love life didn't seem to add much to the plot either. And Lynn - well, I liked her too much to see her treated so badly by the script. Maybe that's what really carried this movie, though. Even if I didn't much care for the plot, I really liked the characters. I wanted them to succeed. And, when success came, I was glad it wasn't too big for them to handle.

3804848,3,B001UV4XHE,"""Sunshine Cleaning"", the new film from Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig) is an enjoyable diversion. It has all the hallmarks of a breakout independent film, off-center wacky characters, unusual story line, slice of life dramatic situations. It has the early box office of other breakout hits. But it also feels a little too calculated, a little too engineered to make it a ""truly memorable experience"", to help it rise to the levels of other genuine hits like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" or ""Broken Flowers"".

Rose (Amy Adams) cleans houses for a living in Albuquerque. The single mother of Oscar (Jason Spevack), she has to start earning more money, to send him to a private school as he has been kicked out of every public elementary school for behavior problems. Her boyfriend, Mac (Steve Zahn), a married cop who is having an affair with her, tells her about a crime scene cleaning service he saw during one of his calls. He starts throwing business to her and she enlists the aid of her sister, Norah (Emily Blunt, ""The Devil Wears Prada"") who can't hold a job and seems reluctant to get involved. Their dad, Joe (Alan Arkin) is happy to watch Oscar while they are out working and takes him along as he tries various sales schemes, to keep trying to make money. As the two sisters get more and more involved in the business, Rose becomes friends with Winston (Clifton Collins, Jr., ""Capote""), the one armed man who runs the supply shop they use for supplies. At one crime scene, Norah comes across photos of a young lady at the home of a deceased old woman. She decides to track her down and tell the woman about her mom's death. When she meets Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub, TV's ""24""), she lies and they become friends.

The best things about ""Sunshine Cleaning"", what sets it above most other films, are the performances by the two lead actresses, Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. They are both very good and give us a little window into the lives of these two people.

Amy Adams has such an undeniable charm and skill it is easy to see why she makes all of the characters she has played seem so real, so effortless. She first gained attention as the pregnant stepsister in ""Junebug"", a very independent slice of life comedy about a young man who returns home to his roots with his fiancee who must deal with the culture shock when he runs away to deal with work, leaving her abandoned. ""Enchanted"", ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"", ""Doubt"" and many others show the diverse range of this actress.

Adams plays Rose, the older daughter of a man who has tried his best to raise his two daughters. But because their mother left the picture very early, the two sisters have had to deal with a lot and Rose lost a lot of her childhood caring for her more impetuous sister, Norah. Now that she is an adult, she has to care for her son, Oskar, and cleans houses to provide for him. But Rose isn't perfect and carries on an affair with her high school sweetheart, Mac, hoping for the day he will leave his wife and return to her.

One day, as Rose is cleaning the house of a new client, she meets the owner, a former high school girlfriend who is living a lot better than she is, pregnant again. The woman invites Rose to the baby shower and this prompts her, pushes her closer to making the decision to move into her new business. But she realizes she will need help and turns to her sister.

As Rose and Norah begin the new business, they learn by trial, making mistakes, finding out rules and regulations as they go. And Winston recognizes this, giving them some literature and guidance to help them along.

As we get to know Rose, it appears that she is very level headed, calm, the one who makes the right decisions. So it is a little shocking, but also a little refreshing to see her carry on an affair with Mac. Even though he is always trying to do good, watching her carry on the affair shows she makes mistakes. It makes her appear all the more human and even more interesting. Later, we learn a little more about their history and their relationship becomes ever more poignant and sad. It is a nice, interesting and very touching performance from Adams.

Emily Blunt plays Norah, who still lives at home with her father and can't seem to hold down a job. But she is always available to watch Oskar, who she adores.

When Rose asks her to help out with the business, she tries hard to avoid it, but can't. She isn't working and can use the money. Initially, it is as difficult for her to face some of the things they have to clean up, as it is difficult for her to simply work hard. It's difficult for both of them. But Rose puts on a professional face and charges forward into the business. Because Norah has less as stake, she rebels more. But does she have less at stake? You can see Blunt infuse the character with doubt and maybe even a little self-loathing. Is she going to live with her dad forever? Will she be able to ever hold down a job?

When she meets Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), their relationship goes down some interesting roads and gives us a more full picture of Norah. She is a confused woman who needs to make some decisions.

But the film is ultimately a little too calculated. It is produced by the same people involved in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and it definitely feels like they are trying to incorporate a formula into the mix here. The wacky grandfather (interestingly, played by Alan Arkin in both films) is a bit off center and tries wacky things. In ""Little Miss"", he was not adverse to buying porn and talking about masturbation. In ""Sunshine"", he tries a couple of get rich quick schemes, including trying to sell gourmet popcorn to candy shops and shrimp ""that fell off a truck"" to a Mexican restaurant he frequents. And he even has a couple of dramatic moments, but these almost feel scheduled somehow. Okay, in ""Little Miss"", we got teary eyed at 56 minutes. So we better have a similar moment in ""Sunshine"". It seems like the filmmakers are trying to hit certain points, include certain emotions and funny bits that have helped successful independent films in the past. If they helped other films, they should help this one, right?

Both films have a precocious young kid in the mix. At least in ""Sunshine"", they changed the gender. Rose's little boy Oskar gets into a lot of trouble at school and Rose will do nothing but support him, so she yanks him out of one class after another. And he loves spending time with his grandfather, helping him in his schemes. He's a cute kid. And his relationship with his relationship with grandpa is cute. But this worked so much better in ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Remember?

Clifton Collins Jr. and Steve Zahn add a nice balance to the cast, making their few scenes memorable and rounding out the quirkiness level.

""Sunshine Cleaning"" is an enjoyable diversion. And many people are going to the film, in all likelihood for the very reasons I have listed above. It is an awfully familiar 'feel good' film. People will laugh. Some may even cry. Most will leave the theater enjoying the experience. But I doubt most will remember the film because it will quickly fade away into the subconscious, confused with other similar films. Until it is forgotten.

Personally, when I go to an independent film, I want a little more bite. I want to feel like I have just seen something no studio would ever make. I want to be surprised, challenged, moved. Why do I look for these things in independent films? Because the majority of studio fare is produced for a mass audience, a mass audience of teenaged boys. When an independent film begins to closely resemble many of the most popular independent films they become less interesting, less surprising, less challenging. And you have to ask yourself. Why bother?",1238371200,,7799,4.5646890636168695
3804849,5,B001UV4XHE,"Every review I've read has been quasi-negative but not being one to listen to critics, I took a chance.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Depending on why you go to a movie, you may not like this because it is not escapism.  It deals with real life issues and things most of us can relate to.  I found the movie to be very refreshing and all the characters real to life.  The main character is a single mom trying to raise a precocious son.  She has to deal with a dead-end relationship and an aging father, an irresponsible sister and a job she hates.  How she copes and what she does is more believable than most of the ""chick flick"" films out today.  I think this is one of the better movies in a sea of fluff to spend time and money on.  Amy Adams is wonderful and it is always refreshing to see Alan Arkin.  Please don't dismiss this film because of iffy reviews.  It is worth going to see.",1238284800,100,896,4.181286549707602

Yes, it had a good plot, but was depressing as it turned out to be too serious, more involved emotionally than I expected.  I thought it was a comedy.  Not.  Amy Adams really should have turned this role down.  The only reason I chose it was due to her being the lead.  Parts were actually painful like interactions with high school classmates who were doing very well in contrast to her situation, and while some viewers may have a different POV I truly could have done without that as she already had more than enough adversity.",1492905600,,639,4.456896551724138

3805088,2,B001UV4XHE,"This formulaic ""com/dram"" has a cute concept, but simply fails to deliver and is anything but ""sunny"" (quite overcast & dreary).  Amy Adams plays the lead, a sorta sympathetic character whose glory days as head cheerleader dating the high school quarterback are over 10 years in the past.  She now works cleaning the houses of her former classmates whose lives have moved on more successfully, while she and her young son live with her father.  Her personal life is more of a wreck, as she meets up with her lackluster boyfriend in cheap hotel rooms for one night stands.  The insight into her unhappy situation in life seems to be that (roughly in her words) ""she is good at getting guys to want her, date her, and sleep with her, but not much else.""  She's also a care taker type of personality that needs to learn focus more on her own life.  Her younger sister's (Emily Blunt) life is also on hold/reverse.  She's sarcastic, cynical, and has trouble holding down a job.  She also has numerous unresolved personal issues.  The two sisters start the Sunshine Cleaning business after a tip that there is a good bit of money to be made cleaning up after grisly crimes.  The film could really have developed here into a much more interesting look at this unique type of business, the different cases, the challenges the two women face, etc...  Instead, the new crime cleaning business isn't developed enough within the plot line.  The movie continues to drag along with little comedy, drama, or character development.  It limps along, rather depressingly toward a mainly unfulfilling ending.  Sadly, there are way too many of these types of movies being pumped out by Hollywood.  Shallow plots with superficial characters and shallow problems.  Gave this one 2 Stars instead of one for the unique concept of crime scene clean-up and a few comedic & touching moments.  But PLEASE, save yourself a couple of hours of your life from this downer and just watch the trailer a few times.  Maybe do something cheery instead, like floss your teeth, brush up on some high school Latin conjugations, or sew on those loose buttons on your jacket.",1481846400,,2134,4.784153005464481

Her younger sister is more the obvious through society's eyes, I haven't got it together deadbeat type who doesn't go to work because she wants to sleep so goes through a lot of jobs.  However she's always there for the mistress' young son, so we know she has potential to become a better societal member if she can apply that to the greater world.  Throw in their father who invests his time and money on not real well thought out get quick rich ideas so ultimately can't keep his promises to his grandson, and you know where this movie is going to ultimately go.  So the journey there is what the movie is about.  Basically the ex cheerleader (Amy Adams by the way) has the suggestion by the police officer who is having the affair with her that she should have a go at the lucrative crime scene clean up industry, since she's a cleaner  already.  It is a decent enough viewing but really anything to compel you to watch it a second time.  Maybe a  bit more humour thrown in as there isn't much.

It stars Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Alan Arkin, Jason Spevack, Steve Zahn, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Clifton Collins, Jr. and Christopher Dempsey in a cameo. Adams character is a struggling single mom who has a child with OCD, plus a father (Arkin) and sister (Blunt) who are also struggling with employment. Adams character is also seeing a married cop who suggests she get into the business of cleanup of crime scenes. She and her sister start ""Sunshine Cleanup"" which leads to much humor. But much more is going on based on one past event and their inability to cope with the present. Adams character is the primary focal point most of the film and she and the family are headed toward some much needed reckonings. Directed by Christine Jeffs. Very Definitely Recommended.

3805482,4,B001UV4XHE,"Oscar nominee Amy Adams plays Rose Lorkowski, a single mom and cleaning lady in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She wants to send her son to private school but can't afford too. Her married boyfriend (Steve Zahn) helps her get started a business with her sister, Norah.

The film is quite a character piece with Oscar winner Alan Arkin as the father. Norah and Rose have their own issues too. The film can make you cry and laugh all at once.

If I have one complaint, I would have liked to know how they made the film. The extra feature talks to Marie Fitzgerald and Dana Hopper who run a similar bio hazard cleaning company in San Diego, California.

I thought Rose should have ended up with the one armed guy in the film. The ending is a bit vague about Norah though. I thought her relationship with Lynn was weird and unresolved. I wanted to scream that Lynn should accept her mother's fanny pack.",1438732800,,893,4.466257668711656

Clifton Collins Jr. was the only actor that I had even remote interest in.

EVERY other character portrayed was either someone who I was wishing would die, or simply pathetic from the kid Oscar to Ms. Adams and Ms. Blunt.

They could have done away with the foul language or at least minimized it and they did not need the sordid adultery scenes to make the movie good.

3805576,5,B001UV4XHE,"A thirty-something single mother whose boundless potential was squandered through a series of failed relationships and a misguided effort to help her younger sister succeed in life finds the fruits of her labors finally coming together in director Christine Jeffs' dark family comedy entitled,Sunshine Cleaning.

Back in high school, the future looked pretty bright for Rose Lorkowski. Not only was she the cheer leading captain, but she was also dating the star quarterback. Flash forward a little over a decade, and Rose is working overtime in hopes of getting her son into a better school. Her sister, Norah is still living at home with their father, Joe, a failed salesman whose penchant for jumping into get-rich-quick schemes has left the family without a financial net to fall back on. Rose may be down, but she certainly isn't out, and when she hatches a plan to launch a crime-scene cleanup business, the money starts rolling in. Sure, cleaning up murder scenes and suicide sites may not be the most glamorous job in the world, but death is a fairly profitable business, and as the phone keeps ringing, Rose and Norah finally begin to experience the closeness of sisterhood that has eluded them all these years while also providing their family with true security.

Taken on its own terms, though, it's a solid indie effort with plenty of nice character strokes by screenwriter Megan Holley and razor-sharp performances by Amy Adams and Emily Blunt as both actresses rise above the clunky premise and execution to once again demonstrate why they've become the go-to girls for any director seeking smart, versatile and warm-blooded talent. Also,its overall ability to balance humor and drama, attention to emotional detail and a few winning performances overcomes its overly familiar plot. Overall,this independent film gives full weight to the impact of death without rubbing our faces in the crime scenes and it sustains through the odd family relationship that we do care for the characters involved. Indeed,this is a must-see film even for the performance of both Adams and Blunt alone.",1419638400,2,2098,5.113702623906706

Adams plays a woman who's life has not amounted to her potential due to such events that keep getting in the way.  It is a heart-warming story and very well done.

Spoilers:  Left out a star because you never really find out if the one armed guy and her ever started anything and also the road trip the younger sister takes comes from out of the blue and was confusing.  Other than that I thought it was a great film.",1409270400,,613,4.2956521739130435

3805685,3,B001UV4XHE,"Amy Adams and Emily Blunt deliver excellent performances in this movie about two sisters trying to get by and recover from the loss of their mother many years ago. There's trouble galore, including a scheming father, a troubled young boy, and the past that looms large over these two. When the financial crunch pinches hardest, Amy Adams goes from maid to bio haz cleaner in an effort to pay for her son's private school. This affords the viewer some comedic and dramatic looks at how we die and the effects on the living. These poignant scenes punctuate a meandering story where no one gets any traction and enable the viewer some insight into Adams' and  Blunts' past with their mother. However, things don't exactly improve for the pair, culminating in a minor disaster that throws the whole thing down the drain. This is a movie about loss and lost love of the familial and romantic type. Yet there is the slightest glimmer of hope, otherwise it would be a total bummer.",1398038400,2,974,4.695906432748538

Back then it was not easy to laugh at, but after watching this movie I could look back and laugh.

Sounds grim or excessive but the movie is light drama in tone. There is plenty of humor as the two women learn their new craft by trial and error. Many are comparing this movie with Little Miss Sunshine, but the only thing the two movies have in common is that Alan Arkin plays the same grandfather character in both movies. I think he is supposed to be funny by being irascible and eccentric while showing us cynical truth. Some find him amusing, but I thought he was rather creepy.

3805808,3,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning, 2009 film

A woman is fired from her job at a restaurant. What will she do next? Can her cleaning skills be applied in a new job? A friend tells her about the high costs of crime scene cleanup (after the body was removed). Rose cleans houses, she meets an old schoolmate. What happened? [Do they look the same ages?] Rose gets a call from school - her son is in trouble. [No male role model?] They tell her the son must take medication - or go to a new school. Can she find a higher paying job cleaning up crime scenes? [What about her boyfriends life?] Do they live in a small town? She and her sister Laura clean up a smelly room. There is conflict. They find maggots! Also pictures of a young girl. They shop for the cleaning supplies they need. Are they charging too little? They learn about the rules for bio-hazard disposal.

Rose learns news about her boyfriends wife. Laura enters an elevator; was she following a lady? Rose visits that motel but her boyfriend is a no-show. Laura looks into a small box. Rose gets tips on future employers. Rose attends a class to learn more. Heather meets her in a store. Business acumen means buying shrimp from a wholesale dealer. Next a man driving a car has a heart attack and drives into a plate glass storefront. There is a call about a suicide in a room - a bloody chair tells the story. [Youll never see these details on any TV crime show.] Grandpas offer of a shrimp sale is refused. [Know your seller?] The story runs on. [Does Lauras stunt by the railroad tracks suggest suicidal thinking?] Roses boyfriend drops by with a gift. Both are refused. Does Rose have a future here?

Rose gets a call from an insurance company. Laura must begin by herself. Rose needs a sitter for her boy (her father is incapacitated). She goes to a baby shower and talks about her business (talking too much?). Laura runs out after a kitten. There is an avoidable accident! [Does this remind you of a Seinfeld episode?] It was an accident. Will insurance cover it? Rose needs a new job. Laura gives some pictures to Heather; will she appreciate this? Oscar has a birthday party. Rose talks to Laura; can she take care of her? [Dont both sisters suffer from poor judgment on important decisions?] Later Rose talks on the CB. I hope you can hear me. She is back to cleaning as a maid. Her father sold his home and invested in a business. Will this be a success? [I hope so.]

This could be a lesson on How not to Ruin you Life. Why were Rose and Laura motherless? Was this the cause of their poor decisions (lack of a role model - no aunts or adult friends)? What did their father do (or not do)? It seems foolish for a small family to not live together - one rent payment instead of three. Or did advertising tell them they should work for the landlord? [You can see or hear these ideas in the media.] Living together provides support for family members, that is why it has been going on forever. But those who need this advice imaging they know better - until its too late. Would Roses father (or aunt) give her good advice about her relationship with a married man? A young boy raised by a single mother alone can have some problems. So too a divorce can create problems for children (no fault of theirs, but they may feel guilty).",1388620800,,3284,4.38752052545156

3805968,4,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning has a lot of amusing moments, but it's not the kind of comedy that tries to make you laugh with every line of dialogue or in every situation. Indeed, some of the subject matter is quite dark.

Rose Lorkowski (Adams) is a single mother. She's good at getting men to want her, but most don't want to date her or enter into any kind of permanent relationship. She's having an affair with a local cop, Mac (Steve Zahn), but it's clear to us that he has no intention of leaving his pregnant wife. Rose is nothing more than a diversion for him and he's not emotionally invested in the relationship.

Rose makes ends meet by working as a maid, but she's hoping to better herself. Mac finds himself investigating a suicide and discovers that it costs around $3,000 to clear up the mess. He suggests to Rose that it would be a lucrative line of work so she decides to give it a try. Rose recruits her sister, Norah (Blunt), and the two buy a van and open a business. Unfortunately, they don't have the required knowledge to do their job safely and within the law. They also don't have any kind of insurance.

The two quickly learn and are helped by the owner of a local store who explains what equipment to buy and how to become certified. Rose's life starts to improve.

The other main character is Joe (Arkin), the girls' father. He means well and is always promising his grandson trips and presents, but he rarely delivers. He reminds me of my grandfather in some ways and is always looking for some kind of scheme to earn money. One such scheme involves selling shrimp to local restaurants, but he's stuck with them when the restaurant owners refuse to buy for health reasons.

This is a quiet film with some good observations on life. One sequence shows Rose desperately trying to fit in with women she knew in school. Why is it important to her that she looks good in front of them? The film doesn't try to make Rose and Norah glamorous. They are portrayed as normal people with flaws and problems to overcome. Both actresses are likable and their relationship feels authentic. Rose has been looking after Norah since their mother died.

There's quite a lot of depth to the film at times. Rose realizes that the job sometimes involves becoming a part of people's lives for a brief period. There's a particularly touching scene in which she comforts a confused old woman who has just found out that her husband is dead. This is the kind of film that can make you reflect on sad situations and then make you laugh a minute later.

The casting is an important ingredient. Adams and Blunt have good chemistry and Arkin holds everything together. While his character often seems clueless, there's a lot more to him. He clearly cares about his daughters and does his best to be a positive force in their lives.

The film also challenges our definition of success. Is career success more important than family or romantic relationships? Does it matter how you make a living if you take care of yourself and the people who are close to you? Should we try and conform to society's definition of success?

Adams sometimes accepts questionable roles, but she is talented and can shine in the right part. I was particularly impressed with her supporting role in Doubt, and she shows here that she has a lot to offer as a dramatic actress as well as in lighter roles.",1332547200,2,3369,4.555371900826446
3805969,4,B001UV4XHE,"I like quirky movies, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. So ""Sunshine Cleaning"" seems like a pretty good option -- it's a rather sweet, dryly-humorous movie about a family who is just trying to get by. The premise is a little hard to swallow, but the actors mostly make up for it with their strong performances and likable characters.

Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) and her sister Norah (Emily Blunt) have pretty unsatisfactory lives -- one is a maid, and the other just got fired from her waitressing job and is living with her dad. When Rose's son is casually expelled from school, she faces either having to give him medication or send him to a private school -- and she can't afford either.

With the help of Rose's married boyfriend, she manages to get a job in biohazard cleanup. Yes, I said ""biohazard cleanup.""

Though their business is initially just a way to get money, Norah and Rose quickly try to turn Sunshine Cleaning into a legitimate business, and begin to learn how they can help other people as they work. But when disaster strikes, everything they've tried to do may go up in incinerator smoke... literally.

""Sunshine Cleaning"" is one of those movies with just the right amount of quirk (talking deer head?) and heart. It's got kind of a ridiculous premise, since I'm pretty sure you need some kind of training and/or licensing to handle biohazardous materials. But I'm willing to suspend my disbelief.

Honestly, what makes this work is the story of the family -- the sisters learning to grow closer as they also learn to understand each other, and the elderly grandfather growing closer to his troubled grandson. The dialogue sounds fairly natural, but still rather funny (""I mean, because people don't realize the safety risks involved with the removal of... blood and body fluids"").

It also has a nice message about our vile school system, which prefers to medicate and/or abandon children who don't turn into nice average little drones.

But it really rests on the trinity of Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin. There are some nice supporting performances, but the movie really revolves around these three -- a single mom who secretly wishes for love, her sister seeking closeness with the daughter of a newly-dead woman, and their eccentric dad who is trying to start his own business.

""Sunshine Cleaning"" isn't perfect, but it has a lot of heart and sweetness floating around in its story. Definitely worth it.",1331769600,,2438,4.815789473684211
3805970,5,B001UV4XHE,"This is not a gross out comedy or a mindless laugh-fest like ""Knocked Up"" or ""Bridesmaid"" (both good films), or a lame ""American Pie"" sequel; it's more of a Fargo-esque kind of comedy drama.... Going in, I was only a semi fan of the much overrated ""Little Miss Sunshine"", but I think ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is 100% better. It struck a chord with me on many levels, and it's layered with subtle and dry, but witty humor (which, at times, is hysterical - much like life); and I really empathized with each character's personal dispositions.

I'm fond of Amy Adams & Emily Blunt & thought they were wonderfully cast in their respective roles. Alan Arkin was good playing what he usually plays: the aloof  but caring father figure we've grown accustom to seeing him play (""Little Miss Sunshine"" & ""The Slums of Beverly Hills"" - another great & underrated film).

At times, this is a tender story of a misguided, albeit, typical American family trying to find a balance to fit into life; which is usually cookie cutter, overbearing and way too pretentious (in the words of Norah's character: ""I think you may have oversold it"")...

I also liked the subtle commentary on how schools are so ready and prepared to discard kids and put them in special ed and on medications rather than dealing with them as unique individuals in a realistic way.
I was also impressed with Rose's bold move to get up & walk out during the baby shower.

I came away really loving this movie for what it is. It may not be for everyone, but if you see ""Sunshine Cleaning"" with an open heart and mind, you'll be emotionally rewarded & realize that it's very misunderstood and deserves way more respect than it gets... That's just my 2 cents.",1328400000,,1707,4.62046204620462

3805972,3,B001UV4XHE,"In Sunshine Cleaning, starring Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin, Rose (Adams) is a young, single mother who works as a maid to keep body and soul together for herself and her son Oscar. But after Oscar gets kicked out of yet another public school, Rose finds herself in need of some quick cash to send him to a private academy.

Via the cop she's having an affair with, Rose finds out about biohazard removal/crime scene clean-up, a service that promises to bring in considerably more money than standard cleaning. She drafts her lay-about sister, Norah (Blunt), into helping her, and the two are on their way.

In many ways, this movie is about how the characters metamorphose to deal with the troubles in their lives. Each character grows throughout the film, and some of the scenes in which they exhibit that growth are beautiful to watch. By the end of the movie, Rose is a business owner who has found some self-confidence. Her father (Arkin), who hatches one crazy business scheme after another, is putting his money into something he believes in. Norah did less growing up, but Blunt performed so many of her scenes with such total credibility that I can hardly fault her.

3805975,4,B001UV4XHE,"""Sunshine Cleaning"" stars Amy Adams and Emily Blunt as two sisters, Rose and Norah, who start up a cleaning service specializing in tidying up crime scenes.  Cleverly, the remains of the violent crimes they are scrubbing away, as well as the shell-shocked survivors of those crimes (often, spouses of suicides who are hovering in the background as Rose and Norah clean up) remind the sisters of the tragedies and issues in their own lives.

If there's a small flaw in the film, it's that the sisters, and their father, played by the always engaging Alan Arkin, have too many issues in their lives that need confronting (as well one central tragedy tying them all together).  This makes the film a bit too busy.  Though not a fatal flaw, I almost felt that all the plot points and character issues could have used a whole season of television, or at least a mini-series, to properly examine them.  Still, things never tip over into incoherence or sketchiness.

""Sunshine Cleaning"" has some humor and sexiness that occasionally lighten the violence of the crime scenes and the trials and tribulations going on in everybody's lives.  In the end, this decent little film with a quirky premise that you haven't seen a thousand times before makes for an amiable evening of home viewing.

The standard DVD of ""Sunshine Cleaning"" features sharp picture and sound, and a couple of cute extra features, including an interview with two ladies who actually run a company that cleans up after crime scenes, and who acted as consultants on the film.",1301356800,2,1535,4.854406130268199
3805976,2,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning is an incredibly dull movie. It's about two sisters who work with each other by driving around a small town and cleaning up bloody homes after a gruesome murder or suicide takes place.

The concept sounds good, but the quality of the storyline is *really* underwhelming and downright boring.

It's supposed to be a drama with light elements of comedy, but it's never interesting or funny enough to win over the viewing audience so it's basically a completely pointless movie.

I truly fail to see the appeal of this film. The side stories are equally disappointing. Who cares that the little boy had a licking problem at school for instance, because the storyline surrounding it is underdeveloped and unsatisfying anyway. The guy missing an arm had no reason to even be featured because he wasn't utilized correctly. A few brief appearances means the writers had *something* in mind for his character, but whatever it was never came to fruition.

The constant arguments between the sisters are always uninteresting and meaningless.  You sit there wondering when the arguing will ever actually end up GOING somewhere, but it never does.

The only moment that saves it comes at the very end when *something* happens (I don't want to spoil it, even though you most likely will have done turned it over by this point). Everything else is horrible.  Avoid this overrated movie like the plague.",1301270400,3,1406,4.957446808510638

I have to say that this is a very unique movie, and the realism of the dialog/script and randomness of it reminded me of some of my favorites like ""Garden State"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"".

The movie bills itself as a comedy drama, which is definitely true though I found it to be more drama than comic. Maybe I was too attached to the characters too soon to see the comedy that was there, or perhaps they mean the Shakespearian version of ""comedy"" which included plays like Hamlet.  Still, many chuckles.

I'll end with this: if you think your family has its issues and quirks, you haven't watched this movie.",1300924800,2,799,4.358108108108108
3805988,4,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning (Christine Jeffs, 2008)

After my first brush with Christine Jeffs--an ill-thought, heavy-handed adaptation of Kirsty Gunn's fine novel Rain ten years ago--I've stayed away from her films. Not that it's been tough; the ensuing decade has brought us just two. But Sunshine Cleaning was almost universally well-received when it showed up, and has stayed generally acclaimed (currently running 71% on rotten tomatoes); I figured I'd get around to seeing it eventually. I did, and it seems Ms. Jeffs has learned about the value of subtlety. Not a great deal, mind you; she still has a long, long way to go. But then, Jane Campion made Sweetie before she made The Piano.

Rose (Doubt's Amy Adams) and Norah (The Devil Wears Prada's Emily Blunt) are chronically underemployed sisters both in need of cash. Rose's illicit boyfriend, the married Mac (A Perfect Getaway's Steve Zahn), mentions there's great money to be made in crime scene cleanup, and the idea beings brewing in her head. Soon, she's roped Norah in and is juggling learning on the job, taking classes for her real estate license, handling her young son (Ramona and Beezus' Jason Spevack) and space-cadet father (Little Miss Sunshine's Alan Arkin). Things are going well, and there's the possibility of a new, and more workable, romance with Winston (Mindhunters' Clifton Collins, Jr.), the guy who runs the supply shop where Rose and Norah get their supplies. But then Rose hits what seems to be an insurmountable obstacle: a high-school reunion/baby shower...

It's not the most original of premises, and it has the feel of ""macabre chick flick"" a time or two, but it's downright funny, thanks to a script from Megan Holley (The Snowflake Conspiracy) and excellent (mostly deadpan) comic timing from all the principals. This is probably never going to enter the vaults of the classics; it feels like a quirky, minor little indie flick (though let's face it, no movie that has a Turteltaub listed as a producer could ever possibly be indie), but not every movie needs to be a classic to make it worth watching. Jeffs has bought some time off the stay in purgatory she earned with Rain by doing Megan Holley's script right on this one. *** 1/2",1300233600,,2219,4.943699731903485

3805990,5,B001UV4XHE,"""Sunshine Cleaning"" (2009) is probably most like ""Tender Mercies"" (1983) and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed that film.  But it is not quite as pure and restrained in its storytelling techniques; there are several visual flashbacks and bit of ""Junebug"" (2006) cuteness but these departures do not really get it the way (at least in part because the flashbacks are done so well).  The promo material emphasizes ""funny and gently heartbreaking"" but don't get the film expecting to see a comedy.  There are a few tension relieving black comedy moments in the style of ""Breaking Bad"" (coincidently Tess Harper of ""Tender Mercies"" plays Jesse's mother on that series).  But mostly it is just portrayals of very wounded people trying keep it together enough to function in the world.

The film does include an awesome and extremely unusual climatic sequence about 10 minutes before the actual ending.  Just as things seem darkest, Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Emily Blunt) unexpectedly get to see their dead mother's appearance in an old made-for-TV movie that they have until then only heard exists.  This film within a film sequence is amazingly moving as the editor cuts between three actresses who look so alike in features and complexions that the customary suspension of disbelief is unnecessary.

Rose is a single mom desperate for money after her impulsive 7-year-old son is thrown out of his elementary school.  Life has beaten her up and been downhill for her since high school.  A chronic need for validation has her trapped in a one-way affair with Mac, her high-school boyfriend (Steve Zahn in a nicely restrained performance), who fathered her son but married someone else.  Rose's younger sister, Norah, is a party hard slacker still living with her father and still traumatized by her mother's suicide when Norah was a little girl.

Mac (a police detective) tips the two sisters to a business opportunity cleaning up messy crime scenes.  The business gives Rose validation and allows her to break off the relationship with Mac.  It gives Norah glimpses into the lives of other troubled families (they clean up a lot of suicides), she connects with their pain but has to learn that pain is a very individual thing.

Credit the success of this film to Adams and Blunt, who became close friends during this production; this translated into a an effortless believability in their portrayal of the dynamic between two sisters (it has simply never been done better).

The other inspired element involves Winston (Clifton Collins), a one-armed janitorial supply store owner.  He baby-sits Rose's son and is a resource for Rose as she tracks up the learning curve of her new business.  Collins gently teases this role and transcends a script that is otherwise a little too sunny.

The DVD includes an excellent commentary special feature in which the writer and the producer discuss the dynamics of adapting the original script and producing the film.  These are typically extremely lame but this one is very well done and quite useful.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1293580800,3,3090,4.970817120622568
3805991,4,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning stars Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, and Alan Arkin. The movie is, on the surface, about two sisters that start a crime scene clean-up business titled Sunshine Cleaning. Rose (Adams) is a single mom, struggling to come to grips with being a has-been and not marrying the love of her life. Norah (Blunt), the younger sibling, lives at home, stays out late partying, and makes a very small impact on society.

Both sisters are in need of money, and, through a series of pulling strings, they start up the crime scene clean-up job. While they work and travel, Rose leaves her son in care of his grandfather, Joe (Arkin).

There are many themes operating throughout Sunshine Cleaning, with family being at the top. How much responsibility does an older sibling have in raising a younger sibling, especially in a single parent home? This question runs along with the movie, and the viewer can feel the love Rose has for Norah and the responsibility she feels for her.

One thing I enjoyed about Sunshine Cleaning is the realistic setting of the movie. I can easily picture this tragi-comic movie taking place down the road, happening to a family or a friend. Realism is often sobering, and should induce social-introspection, and such is the case of this film.

Another plus for the movie is the superb acting of Adams, Blunt, and Arkin. The trio performs brilliantly. You can laugh with them, sympathize for them, and probably cry, too, if you're into that sort of thing. The cast was great, even the minor roles.

Overall, I can recommend watching Sunshine Cleaning. It's a heart-warming tale about family, relationships, and perseverance, filled with humor and love, even when dealing with a bloody crime-scene.

3805992,3,B001UV4XHE,"I enjoyed this movie, but the main difficulty for me was watching the many missed opportunities in the script and direction.  My main disappointment was the lack of change in the protagonist--at the end of the movie, she gives up, ready to call it quits and immediately go back to the life that was so unfulfilling, and it's only an action by her father that pulls her up.  Just what has she learned from her experiences?  Nothing, it seems.

And while her sister is a great character, the script stops a promising relationship of hers in its tracks in a very unsatisfying way--two minutes in a diner, and it's all over.

My major problem with the film, though, was that it was hard to develop sympathy for the characters.  The protagonist is carrying on an affair with a married man (who also starts her on her new career track--does this woman do nothing for herself, without men doing things for her?), and consistently makes bad decisions.  Her anger at her sister for an accident--without ever finding out what really happened--is simply childish and annoying.

There's also no real reaction to the idea of cleaning up the scenes of other people's deaths, other than a short speech by the sister about having some sort of ""connection"" with the victims.  And even with that idea presented, there's no real examination of the effects of that connection.

As other reviewers have noted, this film is also filled with stock characters and cliches.  It's definitely watchable and even enjoyable at times, but uneven and a bit unfulfilling by the end.",1285459200,,1550,4.7894736842105265

This film is NOT a comedy.  It is about as funny as Monster's Ball.  If you like nice, slow, tranquil dramas...then this might be for you.  It also reinforces the fact that regular people do dumb stuff every day.

3805995,4,B001UV4XHE,"It's rare to see a movie with believable dialogue and an odd plot.  Usually, the writer will add more platitudes to the dialogue to dampen the oddness and make the story seem more familiar.  (Superhero movies do this often.)  There's certainly nothing ordinary about a single mother deciding to start a crime scene cleaning business--even when the economy is bad--but the desperation of Rose Lorkowski (brilliantly played by Amy Adams) and her childless-but-a-child-herself sister Norah (played by Emily Blunt) is so complete that it seems like a good idea. Adams excellent sense of pathos draws the audience in; her situation just sucks, and although she doesn't always make good decisions, she indeed suffers.

As great as Adams is in this film, Clifton Collins, Jr. stands out for me.  He takes an essentially thin character (Winston) and makes him vibrant, full of ideas and feelings, even when he's given little to do and little to say.  He does it with such subtlety that it's difficult to pinpoint what he's doing to make the character work.  I haven't seen him in many films, and this seems a shame as he's quite talented.

I have no idea why Alan Arkin is in this film.  He plays the same seemingly absent-minded crank as he does in Little Miss Sunshine only he's less funny here.  The role should have been given to someone who would actually try and not phone it in with their own personality.

The tone of the film is a bit uneven.  Is this a comedy, a drama, a mash of genres?  The director didn't make that decision, and so we call the film ""independent.""  But the excellent acting makes up for the film's few faults.",1277337600,4,1631,4.697183098591549

She is a good actress, but mostly I see her movies as genre redundant - (romantic comedies).  This movie is anything but romantic, in fact it's life-liftingly tragic... if such a thing can be fathomed.

The movie mostly centers around Amy Adam's character as she struggle as a single mom.  She is overwhelmed in life by a mentally fragile sister, weird young son, and get-rich-quick scheming father all in tow.  Needless to say her money situation pushes her into the field of cleaning up crime scenes and other bio hazards.  Each character is flawed by their past and throughout the movie you begin to feel them struggle against the inevitable.

3806048,4,B001UV4XHE,"When Rose (Amy Adams) needs to make money to put her son Oscar (Jason Spevack) into a private school when he keeps getting in trouble at his regular school, she turns to her unreliable sister Norah (Emily Blunt) to help her start a bio-hazard removal/ cleaning business. Even knowing that part of their job is to clean up after dead bodies, they still don't anticipate the job being as difficult as it is. From Norah trying to find the daughter of a suicide to Rose dealing with the personal issues of being a single mom and having an affair with a married cop, the sisters deal with life and a job that's out of the ordinary.

Christine Jeffs (Sylvia) and first time screenwriter Megan Holley came up with the idea for Sunshine Cleaning from the story of two women from Seattle they heard on a National Public Radio ""All Things Considered"" segment. In real life the women are actually best friends who own a biohazard removal/ cleaning service, but naturally with all adaptations things are changed to better move along the story, or to help the audience to identify with the plight of the main characters.

By choosing a pair of regular women to go into a job of this nature, the filmmakers have done a great job of making a movie that has a hint of originality. Also, by choosing a profession of this nature, the movie is also able to deal with elements of life and death, moving on and dealing with the darkness in our past. The movie effectively communicates it's messages while never being overbearing in it's way of dealing with them.

The acting in this movie is great as would be expected from this cast of characters. Twice Oscar nominated Amy Adams (Junebug, Doubt) does a great job as the more stable sister who can't let go of her past. Oscar winner Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine) returns to familiar territory as the patriarch who is always trying new business ventures to try and help his family out, internally showing signs of inadequacy having raised his daughters as a single father. The real winner in the cast is the up and coming Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada, The Young Victoria) as the unstable daughter who can't get over elements of her past that seemingly tear at the fabric of her being.

I really liked Sunshine Cleaning, but I kept getting the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to exert their independence in this indie film by being a lot like other films. Don't get me wrong, homages are the highest form of flattery and some of my favorite filmmakers make great living by making full films based on homages. The problem comes when watching the entire film makes you think of one film in particular in structure and in characterizations. Also following the indie model means that the characters often times have quirks that don't really further the characterization, but are just there to exert the filmmaker's passion to be non-mainstream.

I do highly recommend the movie, and intend to add the film to my collection. I will admit that the indie-isms have a tendency to frustrate me at times, but that doesn't mean that you'll feel the same way when you watch this film. If you like movies like Little Miss Sunshine, you'll enjoy this movie.

3806049,3,B001UV4XHE,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film and am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised, although it did seem to be ""Little Miss Sunshine""'s darker cousin.

Amy Adams stars as Rose, a single mother who opens up a cleaning business at the suggestion of her cop lover (Steve Zahn) and with the help of her troubled sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), in the hopes of being able to pay for private schooling for her gifted young son.  Alan Arkin stars as the father of the sisters and can be considered to be in a continuing role from the one he played in ""Little Miss Sunshine"", but he is enjoyable nonetheless.

The cleaning business is unconventional in the sense that the sisters clean up after crime scenes, such as murders, accidents and suicides.  If there's a bloody mess, they'll be there--gagging and sometimes puking, but they'll be there.  The story line becomes a bit tired in the sense that the sisters learn the truly important aspects of life through the people they assist in their business, but you can dig in to these characters and relate to the issues they have gone through.  Their mother died when they were very young, leaving Rose to care for Norah as their father was usually off trying to pitch his newest ""get rich quick"" products to suppliers and failing miserably, as we see him do in the film.

Norah develops an unlikely acquaintance through trying to do a good deed and ends up learning more about herself in the process.  Clifton Collins Jr. (The Boondock Saints 2) also stars as the charming one-armed owner of the cleaning supplies store who ends up becoming a very good friend to Rose.

There are some humorous moments in this movie, but mostly is a drama and a pretty decent story.  Some elements like the made-for-TV movie the girls keep trying to find on their TV screens seems a bit sappy and feels like it's been done before but all in all, this definitely makes for an enjoyable film about learning about oneself, triumphing over personal conflict and realizing what's truly important in life.",1269820800,2,2063,4.627397260273972

I think Indies are just as guilty, and in fact I hate it more when Indies are full of cliches because they have no excuse.  At least Hollywood blockbusters are mostly entertaining.

Sunshine Cleaning is no better than a Hollywood movie.  The gimmick:  Two sisters start a biohazard clean-up service.  I'm convinced this movie started with this germ of an idea alone, not with the desire to tell a family drama story.  It could have gone in any direction - tale of hardship; mystery; comedy.  But I'm pretty sure the idea of the cleaning company came first.  Then come a parade of Indie movie cliches we've seen a million times:  Struggling mom hard on her luck; tension between hard-working care-taking sibling and younger ne'er-do-well sibling; eccentric grandparent; parent committing suicide; someone screaming at a passing train to relieve angst; genius kid (made especially cliche because the kid is a trouble-making brat and the sympathetic mom has a ""It's them, not you"" attitude when he's sent to the principal's office), etc, etc.  I wanted something original.  It could have been VERY funny.  The morbid nature of the cleaning business wasn't taken advantage of.  I wanted either more dark comedy, or more creative ""clean-ups.""  Scenes of the sisters on the job were mostly just to establish that they were actually working, not very integral to the plot.

All that said, it was worth watching.  Redeeming features:

- Amy Adams (always)

3806052,4,B001UV4XHE,"Rose Lorkowski`s life is going nowhere fast.  Though she lived out what would appear to be every girl's dream in high school - Miss Popularity, head cheerleader and girlfriend to the quarterback  - Rose (Amy Adams) is now a struggling single mom barely eking out a living cleaning other people's houses.  One day, the quarterback (Steve Zahn) - now a married cop who's been seeing Rose on the side for years - suggests she look into cleaning up after crime scenes and biochemical mishaps which pays a good deal better.  Thus, together with her directionless, unemployed younger sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), Rose embarks on a whole new career, albeit one for which she is completely unlicensed and which requires her to step on the toes of some already well-established companies in the area.  Meanwhile, her high-strung, grade-school son (Jason Spevak) tootles around their Albuquerque neighborhood with his eccentric Grandpa Joe - played by, who else?, Alan Arkin - working on an endless series of harebrained, get-rich-quick schemes that raise the young boy's expectations but ultimately go nowhere.

""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a sleeper indie comedy that celebrates the entrepreneurial, can-do spirit while still maintaining a relatively clear-eyed view of the world as it is.  Adams and Blunt bring enormous texture to their portrayal of two sisters whose lives - for good or for ill - refuse to conform to the conventional mold society has laid out for them.  Yet, for all the joviality of the movie's tone, the job they're doing conjures up painful memories of a tragic event in the girls' past, one that has both united and divided them through the course of their adult lives.  The job also brings up issues of power in their relationship that have lain dormant for years.

Beyond the two lead women, there are splendid performances by Arkin, Spevak, Zahn, Clifton Collins, Jr. (Perry in ""Capote"") as a one-armed model-maker, and Mary Lynn Rajskub (""24,"" ""Mysterious Skin"") as a skittish, strangely reserved young woman to whom Norah stretches forth the hand of friendship after her mother`s death.

The screenplay by Megan Holley allows both the drama and humor to arise organically out of the situation and the characters, and, as a result, nothing ever seems over-the-top or forced in the film.  Ditto for Christine Jeff's smooth, incisive direction, which uses the unusual (for movies, at least) New Mexico locale to excellent effect.

Emily Blunt's Norah also has issues - she cannot keep a waitress job at a ""restaurant"" that is really a lunch counter which does not need a waitress.

He is a police detective who married another classmate and has several children.  His wife is pregnant again.  However, he wants Rose to succeed in life and move on from the low-paying maid service job she currently has.  He educates Rose on the high-paying occupation of crime-scene cleanup.

I'd seen the producers' first film- Little Miss Sunshine & loved it. Unfortunately I'd expected the same thrills in this movie, especially since Alan Arkin was in it.

There's enough reviews on here stating what the movie's plotline is, so I won't waste time describing it in great detail. The movie's premise of a pair of sisters cleaning up crime scenes was an interesting one. Needless to say, it hasn't been done before. I liked that it was unique in several ways & I loved Alan Arkin as the eccentric grandfather. It wasn't that much of a stretch from his role in LMS, but hey- the guy does a great job in those roles.

The biggest downfall of the movie is that it tries a little too hard to do too much & there's not a huge amount of resolution seen. It's hinted at, but not actually shown. I just didn't really get into any of the characters for the most part. They just seemed a little one dimensional to me. The minor characters were great & it's not like anyone did a terrible job acting, it's just that there wasn't a lot of depth given to the characters.

The movie garners sympathy for each major character, recognizing both their strengths and flaws, and making them as such very human and accessible.  Perhaps the only place where the film strays from this realistic portrayal, is when it tries to contrast the working class Adams with her succesful high school classmates at a baby shower she attends.  The classmates are portrayed as totally one-dimensional, caring only about material and superficial things.

It's moving, funny, biting, sad, touching, unpredictable, wrenching, and uplifting--all without being sappy or Hollywoodesque in the least.

It's also great social commentary: an acid satire on the American Dream running into the sands in New Mexico and dying, often by suicide.

Yet the satire is never heavy handed.  Sunshine offers only glancing blows, quick and telling, and lets the chips fall where they may.

Rose's high-school friends are portrayed as having the most shallow and vapid of lives (their idea of fun is to eat chocolate feces out of diapers at a baby shower), yet they are good hearted and just as much victims of their empty surroundings as the more tragic, down-on-their luck suicides and trailer dwellers near them.

The opener, the sporting-good suicide, is treated as just a bother: a blood spattering mess to clean up.  (Wonderful touch: the suicide sprays his breath with Binaca before doing the deed.)

But as the movie progresses, Rose and Nora move beyond the physical horror of their job (cleaning up death-scenes, usually violent) to the worse psychological horrors and sad, cluttered loneliness that produced them.

The characterization is spectacular, the scenery stark and beautiful and sterile, the acting wonderful.

Directed by Christine Jeffs (whose previous credit is the depressing Sylvia Plath biopic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sylvia/dp/B00005JMJD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sylvia</a>, starring Gwyneth Paltrow) and written by first-time screenwriter Megan Holley, the film maintains a casual pace and a modest tone considering the oddball plot developments that drive the surprisingly cohesive narrative.

The primary story focuses on the unfulfilled potential in Rose's meager life and how challenged she is to act upon it. Filled with comically nightmarish visions thanks to inventive horror stories from Rose's embittered slacker sister Norah, Oscar becomes enough of a problem at school that he needs to be moved to a private school. In need of cash for the tuition, Rose decides to take the advice of her married lover Mac (of course, the former star quarterback in high school and now a police officer) and becomes a specialist in cleaning up after bloody crime scenes. It also gives Rose an opportunity to partner with Norah, who begrudgingly agrees to participate in the often stomach-turning venture. For a brief time, they become successful in this unsavory niche, but the situation is complicated by their joint personal history triggered by their mother's suicide when they were children.

Beyond Adams' fine work, Emily Blunt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>) proves her versatility playing Norah as a nihilist hiding a pained, inarticulate memory of her mother. Alan Arkin is on familiar territory as Rose and Norah's father, an unquenchable salesman ready for the next get-rich-quick scheme. His comic scenes with Jason Spevack, who plays Oscar, will remind you of very similar scenes with Abigail Breslin in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Miss-Sunshine/dp/B000K7VHQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Miss Sunshine</a>. Gradually moving away from his standard doofus roles, Steve Zahn plays Mac pretty cleanly as an adulterer who can't get over Rose despite the imminent arrival of a second child.

SUNSHINE CLEANING has a dark, dirty side. It isn't what you think. From many of the previews, you might think it to be a quirky comedy; and on some, short level it is. But it is far from comedic. It is touching and brilliantly acted, has a bare-bones script that cuts straight to the heart, and surprises you at nearly every turn. But it's really not that funny. Oh it has its moments for sure, but you've seen them all in the previews (one of the sisters falling down on a heavily fouled mattress, etc.).

The basic story surrounds two sisters, Rose (Amy Adams,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Pettigrew-Lives-for-a-Day/dp/B0018M6J90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day</a>) and Norah (Emily Blunt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000JSI7BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>), who struggle at different ends of the same rope; a rope that represents their lives and is knotted in the center by the suicide-death of their beautiful mother. Tugging in one direction is Rose, a single mom trying to make ends meet by working as a cleaning woman and having an affair with former high school - and now married - sweetheart Mac (Steve Zahn,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Texas/dp/6305800944/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy, Texas</a>). Life hasn't worked out the way Rose has hoped after high school, where she was on the cheerleading team. Problems quickly surface for her as her only child Oscar (Jason Spevack,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywoodland/dp/B000KWZ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywoodland</a>) gets booted from his elementary school for bizarre behavior. Needing to send him to a specialty school (that is expensive) she falls into a job as a crime scene clean-up specialist after getting the advice from lover Mac.

Tugging the other direction is Norah, the sister who can't (or refuses) to hold down a steady job ...except for babysitting Oscar and telling him horror stories about the Lobster Monster (another of the few funny moments in the film). Rose convinces Norah to join her in her new blood and body fluid cleaning business, and the two of them quickly learn how lucrative it can be, and how little they know about its machinations (""You can't throw contaminated human material into dumpsters?""). But Rose is doing it for her son so that she can afford to send him to an appropriate school, and Norah is doing it so that she can be close to her sister and, perhaps, protect her from some of what might come trickling back, like memories of their mother's death.

Amongst all of this comes Oscars birthday and his desire for a pair of binoculars. Grandpa Joe (Alan Arkin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Miss-Sunshine/dp/B001JNNDDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Miss Sunshine</a>) has promised to get him a very expensive pair and has to come up with the cash quickly, leading him to make a financial misstep and end up with tons of rotten seafood. It is here that everything comes to a head. Rose and Norah remember that their mother had a bit part in a small TV production and they see a re-run of it one day from the respective homes and this helps remove some of the knot in that rope that each of them holds on to. They also remember that she killed herself in the family bathtub and when Norah enters her father's house and smells death coming from the bathroom, the memories flood back in. She races in and finds her father bailing dead shrimp from the tub. This was quite a moment if one pays attention.

It is the intermix of relationships and how each character deals or doesn't deal with them that holds this film together and makes it a surprising success. Amy Adams does another great job acting as a vulnerable yet determined woman trying to make good for her son. Emily Blunt is stunning as the confused and embittered sister who loves the smell of everything her mother left behind and deals with her puzzled relationships. Even Jason Spevack does a good job as the weird kid trying to understand what his family is going through and how he's supposed to act.

If you're in the mood for a good character film, and not necessarily a rousing comedy, you might try tugging on this one.",1262822400,2,4460,5.4847161572052405

Going in to the film, I was skeptical because so many of these independent films just fall flat on their faces with the previews making them look way better than they are (e.g. Margot at the Wedding GAG!)but this was a well put together project that utilized great performers, nice direction, and a convincing atmosphere.

I laughed, cried, pondered and all without feeling like the makers were slapping me in the face with toilet humor, maudlin drama, or sanctimonious politicizing.

3806187,5,B001UV4XHE,"Don't believe the naysayers - SUNSHINE CLEANING is a charming, intelligent and deeply felt film. Telling the story of dysfunctional sisters Rose and Norah (played likeably by the brilliant Amy Adams and Emily Mortimer) starting a business as a crime scene clean-up crew in the suburbs. In spite of this potentially grim subject matter, Megan Holley's script mostly eschews a downbeat or depressing tone, indeed it often surprises  with its warmth and sensitivity. The film is at times quite funny, but it's more often very moving. There is also an admirable economy of storytelling. We are told everything we need to know about these characters in under 90 minutes. In the hands of a lesser talent one might easily imagine something more lengthy and ungainly.

Concentrating on the different ways in which people slowly come to terms with life's traumatic upheavals and disappointments, there is never anything heavy-handed or preachy in the screenplay. This intelligent, subtle approach is beautifully complimented by Christine Jeffs' direction. There is an almost documentary style to the way the film is shot, though this is not to say there are lots of wobbly hand-held camera takes and the visual style with its gently subdued  pastel colours is never at the expense of the narrative or the performances.

There is not one poor actor on show, and it's a shame really because of its ""independent"" status, intelligence and (comparatively) low budget that SUNSHINE CLEANING will not be as familiar to audiences if it were produced by one of the bigger US studios. All the principal actors give career-best performances and the dependable Alan Arkin is especially worthy of praise. Jason Spevack, playing Rose's 8 year-old son is also exceptional - a superb child-actor who quietly steals scenes without being saccharine or irritatingly precocious.

The extras on the DVD are slightly disappointing. The most interesting feature is the short documentary ""A FRESH LOOK AT A DIRTY BUSINESS"" which looks at the reactions of 2 actual clean-up workers to the fictional representation of their profession in the film. Both Emily Blunt and Amy Adams make brief interview appearances here, but I personally could have done with a longer ""Making-of..."" documentary. The commentary by writer Megan Holley and producer Glenn Williamson is not without value but it lacks the kind of insights that would make one look at the film afresh, instead the discussion mainly focuses on the experiences of the film crew at the Albuquerque locations and of various drafts undergoing rewrites.

The two heroines, rather predictably life-style opposites, team up to run a crime-scene clean up company.  I would have thought this would be a suitable plotline for plenty of developments but the writer and director kept spinning off minor sub-plots which just took up too much time to resolve and I felt they rather gave up after eighty-eight minutes.

All the actors turned out a competent performance but without much of a solid story to work with there was nothing special they could do.  One thing that I did find noticeable were frequent scenes of some very minor activity that added nothing to the story and in fact could have been edited out and no one would notice, maybe they were just padding.

3806191,5,B001UV4XHE,"""Sunshine Cleaning"" is the type of a film that ranks alongside Nicole Holofcener's works on feminine drama; works that feature strong but flawed female characters that are still relatable by all audiences. With ""Sunshine Cleaning"", there is less humour though, the supposed comedy that the trailers have tacitly promised us prior to its release. Instead, we are presented the inner problems of the two women without painting them with a single neat stroke of characterization; they are complex characters leading very messy lives. Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Amy Adams), both of whom have been traumatized in many ways by their mother's suicide, explore their options in bettering their lives by virtue of working as crime scene cleaners. Their chosen career path is an ironic statement: for the first time, they want to be able to finally come into terms with the great loss of losing their mother, and even perhaps the huge empty void created by the mother herself through her suicide. Indeed, it is a grim world for both of these women. They are restless, lost and severely damaged. Their situations are emphasized by the directors simple approach: the film implores the world by its humdrum nature: unglamorous, even snail-crawlingly boring, with people working as maids, where kids are left uneducated, where suicide could seem to be the only option...""Sunshine Cleaning"" is realistic, and even downright terrifying in its minimal approach in viewing life through its grey lenses.  Both Amy Adams and Emily Blunt churn out great performances. This is understated, quiet drama that is delicate with sprinkles of unabrasive humour.

It consists of two sisters who are behind in life due to their own choices. There are no 'victims' here. These women (played very well by Amy Adams and Emily Blunt) have made some bad decisions in life and as a result are playing catch-up.

The movie (unlike Little Miss Sunshine) simply does not have a false note. All the people places and situations are remarkably believable. You will learn more about the do's and don'ts of crime scene clean-up than you thought possible.

The movie is also wonderfully free of cynicism and snarkiness. While both those elements certainly have a place in film, it is refreshing to see a warm comedy about real people in transitional circumstances.

Overall, Sunshine Cleaning is light fair with warm feelings and a happy ending.

3806195,4,B001UV4XHE,"Director Christine Jeffs' ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a terrific example of what independent films do best; offer rewarding character studies of believable people, without all the gloss and overkill of major studio features. While the subject matter may seem distasteful (cleaning up crime scenes), this is really a film about family, growing up, and discovering life paths, played by an exceptional cast.

Amy Adams surprises me more, with each film, and she is simply perfect, here, as the older of two sisters, whose prestige and promise in high school was derailed after graduation by having a son out of wedlock. While her classmates went on to bigger things, she focused on raising her son, accepting work as a maid, while struggling to earn a real estate license. Adams captures both the beauty and optimism that continues to enthrall her now-married high school boyfriend (Steve Zahn), as well as the growing desperation of a mother trying to provide for her child (Jason Spevack). As her younger, non-conformist sister, British actress Emily Blunt is equally good, trying to establish a life of her own, yet sensitive to the pain of others. The always terrific Alan Arkin (everybody's favorite father/grandfather figure) rounds out the family, as their loving, dreamer dad.

When the opportunity to make quick cash doing a crime scene clean-up appears, Adams and Blunt grab it, doing nearly everything wrong, but seeing a bigger check than being a maid or waitress could provide. They start a business, steered in the right direction by a one-armed, likably laconic supplier (Clifton Collins Jr., in another stand-out performance), and with the newly-coined 'Sunshine Cleaning', the entire family will experience joy, pain, frustration, and ultimately, renewal. The journey is an emotionally rewarding one for viewers, and makes the film quite wonderful!

A very interesting 'Making Of"" featurette is included, with the observations of two women who actually provide crime scene clean-up, and it is a fascinating look at an unusual job.

3806196,4,B001UV4XHE,"Amy Adams and Emily Blunt star as two sisters coming to crossroads in their lives in ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  Adams plays Rose, a former high school cheerleader and all-around popular girl who has found herself living as a single mother and cleaning houses to make it through the day.  Her sister Norah (Blunt), is still living at home with their father, Joe (Alan Arkin), and is basically an irresponsible slacker with no drive whatsoever.

Emotionally beaten, Rose attempts to make herself feel better through the use of self-motivation and by having an affair with her former high school sweetheart, Mac (Steve Zahn).  Her son, Oscar (Jason Spevack), gets into trouble one too many times and Rose decides to pull him out in order to put him in a private school.  Needing money to do this, Mac helps her get started in a biohazard removal and cleaning job at crime scenes.

She recruits Norah to assist her and the pair fumble their way through their first couple of jobs until they meet a cleaning store owner named Winston (Clifton Collins, Jr.) who helps them get the proper supplies and certifications to do their job.

On one particular cleaning job, Norah finds pictures of a deceased woman's daughter and sets out to find her.  When Norah finds the daughter, however, she cannot tell her why she is seeking her out at first.  The daughter, Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), and Norah quickly find themselves forming a strong bond with each other.

Meanwhile, Joe is put in charge of Oscar until Rose can get her young son into a private school.  This means that the pair hit the road together on a number of Joe's money-making schemes.  Their relationship is hilarious and touching at the same time.

Slowly getting a foothold on her life, Rose attempts to capture some of her past happiness by visiting an old friend for a baby shower.

Unfotunately this leads up to a major accident that threatens to destroy not only Rose's cleaning business, but her life as well.

This film is very bittersweet.  Rose is a very likeable character.  She's desperate to be the person that everyone thought she would become after high school, and I believe that many people can relate to her character in that way.  Norah, despite being a complette slacker, is also very appealing.  While her sister has a definite direction that she wants to be going in, Norah has no clue as to what she wants in life.  Once again, I believe that many people can relate to this character's situation.

While Adams does an excellent job in the lead role, it is the supporting cast that really makes this film shine.  Arkin is top-notch as always, and provides plenty of humor and heart-tugging moments.  Collins does a wonderful job as Winston, and I found myself wanting to see his character developed more as the film went on.  Spevack plays off of the rest of the cast to make his young character very enjoyable.  I particularly enjoyed his interaction with another young child in a candy store.  Steve Zahn has a small but key role in the film, and does his best with what he has to work with.  Blunt and Rajskub also do excellent jobs in their roles.  Like Zahn, Rajskub has a small part, but what happens between her character and Norah becomes emotionally intense.

Overall, I really enjoyed ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  If I had one major gripe, it would be that the end of the film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and I highly doubt that there will ever be a sequel to resolve these questions.

Mr. Collins, Jr. is too talented to take such a small part where his role is as more of a prop than a character worth developing.  Regardless of Mr. Collins Jr.'s involvement, the character he played could have improved the movie with minimal expansion.

I wanted a movie about the strength of troubled relatives as they came together as a family.  Perhaps it was my expectations that got the better of me.  Perhaps this movie was a good idea in theory and once executed missed its mark.  If you must, decide for yourself.  I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this movie.",1255737600,,1295,4.672566371681416
3806219,4,B001UV4XHE,"I cannot understand those who were bored by this film. I was entranced; good performances all around married to a well-developed plot with skillful writing yielded a totally satisfying experience. As one who did not much care for ""Little Miss Sunshine"", I was certainly not hoping for a repeat. And did not get it.

The guy at my Blockbuster store said ""Oh, good movie. My wife and I watched it three times; we really liked it,"" when we checked it out. Three times may be a bit much, but it held us. The subplots that go nowhere (the blood bank gal, the problems in school) were, to me, perfect expressions of the fits and starts that life endlessly presents. Not everything gets tidied up; not everyone sees our attempted generosity as we do; not all stories have a satisfactory conclusion. Sometimes people are jerks, bad things happen, and we get stuck. One other pleasure was that the two people who seem to be experiencing the first sparks of interest do not hook up. How nice for a story to allow two lonely people to stay lonely, at least for now.

The other thing I truly liked about this film is that everywhere else Hollywood despises low paid labor and those who perform it. (In the movies that is; in real life, where stars are lining up defending illegal immigration so their lawns, pools, and bathrooms can be cared for at bargain rates, things are different.) But a maid and a small shop owner are treated respectfully. These are hard-working people trying, not terribly successfully, to make a go of things, and the film never laughs at them or insults them or condescends to them. Thank you.

And it wonderfully destroys some idiotic fantasies. Suicide is not glamorous and poetic, not heroic or brave; it is the ultimate act of self. You can not claim to love people when you splatter your brains across their floor and allow them to clean up the mess. That is absolute selfishness. It is not love. Love means working hard to help people, giving up something of value. Love is not motel sex. It is not sex at all; it can, and often is, the exact opposite. Love is not glorifying the old days, hoping they come back. Love is living in the now, doing what must be done, giving up what must be cast aside, and pulling together despite all the reasons there are to pull apart. This film shows that with tenderness and beauty.",1255564800,35,2339,4.551068883610451
3806220,4,B001UV4XHE,"Contrary to some other reviews, I found this movie to be a good one.  It's basically an adult coming-of-age story about two women and their father.  Those who enjoy movies about families and members' relationships with each other will definitely enjoy this one.  There is a romance, or two actually, but the focus is on how the two sisters find empowerment rather than on getting a man - which I found highly refreshing.

It's not a zany, fun, movie - more of a serious look at how we interact and grow through events and relationships.  In my opinion, it should have been marketed as such.  Although there are humorous incidents, the movie itself is more a humor-tinged family drama than a comedy.  It almost has a literary quality to it.

Should appeal to those who liked Steel Magnolias, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and other such videos.",1255219200,,853,4.64
3806221,5,B001UV4XHE,"By far, I must say one of the quirkiest and enjoying movies on death and coping with death since HBO's ""Six Feet Under"". Overall, I was suckered into this film by the great Alan Arkin who won best supporting actor Oscar for ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Also, Amy Adams and Emily Blunt have done some great indie films so the cast of actors really drew me in. Immediately, the film set is exactly as my friend described. It's the beautiful backdrop of Albuquerque, NM. The whole premise is quite simple where two sisters start a new business in cleaning up crime scenes as well as other unfortunate deaths in homes. It sounds pretty gruesome which it is but also quite personal. Both Adams and Blunt are wonderful actresses to have empathized with the recently deceased and surviving partners/relatives. Arkin is just great at scheming with his grandson on his latest plan for selling shrimp to local restaurants at a profit. There is just too many scenes to describe but my favorite one would have to be the baby shower. After you watch it, you can totally relate to the scene.

The best part of the DVD is that you can actually watch how the film makers developed the characters and scenes. This is actually based on the lives of 2 women who now clean up crime scenes. It is quite moving to hear from them how these are quite true in the film as well. It's nice to see that the film stayed true to actual events and experiences from these 2 women. I loved the end of the film and I can't give it away or it will ruin it for you. I will just have to say that this resonates with me just like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". It gives you a sense of both reality and also acceptance of what life is really about or how we see ourselves.",1254614400,2,1721,4.378125
3806222,4,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning is a pleasantly watchable movie, there are moments are pure hilarity, and underlying this are some very real and occassionally beautifully revealed motivations. The director, Christine Jeffs, almost nails this movie however I think she just misses the mark.

Sunshine Cleaning is about Rose (Amy Adams) and her sister Norah (the extraodinary Emily Blunt) who are lost. Rose is cleaning houses and reciting self-help mantras. Norah is constantly losing menial jobs. Their father is always on the look out for an opportunity, which doesn't always work out. Rose is having an affair with a cop who turns out is significantly from her past/ Everything comes to a head though when not only is her young son expelled from schoo, but she meets a woman she is cleaning house for who was in her cheerleading squad at school. It is beautifully played scene you can just feel Rose's quiet desparation to be more than she is.

Rose sets up Sunshine Cleaning - a company to clean up crime scenes -  with her sister. She wants to make money - to get her son into private school and to fund her real estate studies. After a few false starts (cleaning old blood up with toothbrushes), she begins to be more professional about it. In fact she starts to really like it. In the background however is her son, who has problems of his own and needs to go to a sympathetic school.

There are utterly excellent set ups in this, the cleaning is at times gross-out, at other times hlarious. Adams and Blunt are dynamic as sisters and Alan Arkin plays a great father. The one-armed cleaning retailer (don't know his name sorry) did a pretty star turn too. Jeff's direction around the suicides and the girls own issues is done incredibly well - I love the way she doesn't telegraph what is happening, but rather lets the audience into the issue little by little.

What really didn't work was the wrapping up of the loose ends. It just didn't seem to gel to me. Why did Norah do what she did in the end - it just seemed an excuse to get rid of her, why did Arkin do what he did - again it didn't seem explained to me. It seemed as though the movie needed to be wrapped up and that was the easiest way to do it.

Also the filming - I realise that there is a reality element, and perhaps it is supposed to reflect the characters own lives, but the scenes were so astonishingly dark at times I could barely see a thing.

Amy Adams is great, a real little battler however I thought Emily Blunt was outstanding. Having just seen her in Young Victoria, I knew that she was in this movie, I would never have been able to pick that this is the same woman. Her range and conviction is amazing. She is definitely an actress to watch.",1254528000,,2713,4.457661290322581

The trailers left the impression of a film both lighter and edgier than Sunshine Cleaning turned out to be.

That said, Sunshine Cleaning is a perfectly decent little independent tale of family disfunction leavened with a little quirkiness and humor. There are good performances all around and Adams and Blunt are credible as sisters.

And after I finally decided to check it out after a few good recommendations from friends I have to say that I haven't changed my mind. The trailer makes this film look like a middling dramedy slightly less funny than Little Miss Sunshine and that's what the film turns out to be. Amy Adams is a decent actress but has received a bit too much acclaim over the past few years since her breakout in Junebug. She's enjoyable here but the script doesn't give the audience much reason to support her character, painted as an ex-head cheerleader still sleeping with her (now-married) ex-boyfriend from high school and working as a cleaning woman. It's hard to tell if this is by design or by accident. I felt equally apathetic towards Emily Blunt's slightly lazy younger sister character. Only Alan Arkin (as a more-or-less depressed failed entrepeneur) and Clifton Collins Jr. (as a lovelorn cleaning supplies salesman) really stand out in this haphazard and disappointing attempt at ""indie quirkiness."" At times almost funny and at times almost touching, Sunshine Cleaning is ultimately neither, though it manages to present an interesting, though depressing, look at a family's reaction to death in the family.",1254009600,4,1368,5.057522123893805
3806277,5,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning, featuring Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Adam Arkin starts with a BANG (literally) and then never failed to hold my attention. Crime scene cleanup isn't an occupation to which I've given much thought; however, as Amy Adams begins her cleaning journey with a little pink top and a dust pan, I found her humiliation upon discovering she was cleaning the home of a former classmate--one who always ""looked up to her""--palpable. When we further learn she's an unwed mother, who is having an affair with a married man, and that has a difficult younger sister (Emily Blunt) whom she helped to raise after their mother committed suicide, the character is fully developed and believable.  The same can be said about Alan Arkin's character (the loving, helpful father) and Emily Blunt (a bit of a drifter, lost in her own misdirection).

This is a slice of life film with outstanding performances, which I think will be especially meaningful for sisters--particularly those who have been raised by a single parent or are raising a child on their own. It tugs at your heart and makes you champion the characters. I recommend it.

Acting was top notch and as others pointed out, the scenes and situations were more like real life.  As the two sisters went about their new ""job"" my wife and I were asking questions like, ""whoa, can you do that without the health department or some agency not having issues with it"".  The movie does not dissapoint and addresses those things in a realistic manner.  Good character development which lead me to care about these people.",1253664000,,682,4.416

I like how Adams' character looked at the cleaning as a way of helping people, even if it was a little morbid. It was helpful, and that is what counts.

Alan Arkin is always a treat, and I really like Emily Blunt. Her fake American accent is so convincing, she's good. I loved her in The Jane Austen Book Club. Amy Adams is a doll, and I think she was perfectly suited to her role.

I watched the special feature about real crime scene cleaners, and I thought it was entertaining. I like how they compared the movie cleanup scenes to what goes on in real life, and I just think it's so neat that there are people out in the world who really do this type of work.

Their business venture into cleaning up the mess the dead leave behind is hillarious and fun.  The story works so wonderfully and though the end seems forced and a little contrived, it works for what the movie is.

There were plenty of things in the movie that I had to stop at, which is why I got the movie to watch again.  There were just so many things in it that had some sincere and entertaining brilliance, and other things that played a bit dumbed down and a bit contrived.

This movie takes you along as an ambitious but uneducated single mom (Adams) attempts to improve her life by starting her own biohazard clean-up business.  Your heart reaches out to her, and you desperately hope for her to succeed as the obstacles continue to mount up.  The characters centered around Adams are realistic and totally believable for their socioeconomic standing - from the unmotivated lost soul sister, to the get rich quick/scam artist father, all the way to her emotionally troubled, poor performing son.  The only character clearly out of place is Adams - here is a well spoken, kind hearted, white, professionally sweet, hard working, fast learning, physically fit, stunningly beautiful, mid-twenties women who can only find gainful employment through cleaning houses ... this doesn't make any sense, and is clearly at odds with the typical stereotype.  This movie is both hopefully motivating and depressingly sad at the same time.  Production quality is good; and on location filming in Albuquerque, NM (an ever increasingly popular trend in the moving making industry) is well done.  The writing is crisp and inviting.  Directing is also good, and the cast does an outstanding job of making their somewhat unbelievable lives real and empathetic (especially Adams - who has the biggest challenge for making a totally unbelievable character real).",1252454400,,1465,5.311688311688312

This film gets pretty serious at times and what an enjoyable ride it is made easier by the stellar cast.

This is no ordinary cleaning business but a crime scene clean up after the bodies have been moved and evidence secured and all that remains are the blood and the remanants of the deceased's life. What I loved about this film is the humanity of the characters, real people, real problems and real situations that have you pulling for them even as you shake your head at their mistakes. Alan Arkin is a joy as the cranky, scheming father of Rose and Norah, he is at a place as an actor that he brings so much of what you expect from him as an actor while also bringing such subtle differences to all his characters that you never feel you're seeing the same character you might've seen in another movie. Amy Adams is a shining revelation of eternal optimism and she has you pulling for her as she tries win over her own demons. Emily Blunt and Jason Spevak as Oscar are wonderfully funny and real. There is a real honesty amidst some outrageously funny stuff that never panders or lectures and never cheats the audience. I only felt cheated at the end when the movie ended. I wasn't ready to leave this family behind and wanted to live with them a little longer. That is a good thing when a movie leaves you wanting more.",1252368000,18,1543,4.398601398601398
3806286,3,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning is one of those movies you will spend a lot of time trying to love.  Sadly, despite all of its strengths, the film never elevates itself above mediocre dramedy territory.

The story follows semi-depressed single mother and maid Rose (Amy Adams) along with her loser sister (Blunt) and her father starring Alan Alda in basically the exact same role he tackled in Little Miss Sunshine.  Rose's ex boyfriend and current affair subject is a married cop who recommends she start her own crime scene cleanup business as it pays well.

Along the way, Rose enlists her sister's help and meets a variety of interesting characters.  Yet the movie meanders through the middle scenes.  Several plot lines, include one between a nurse and Blunt's character fizzle without a strong resolution.  However, the movie does have a number laughs and the characters, as underveloped as they could be, were interesting nevertheless.

Blunt steals every scene she is in and Adams is actually a bit flat through most of the movie, semmingly half due to her character and half due to the meandering script.

Despite its myriad flaws, the movie is still enjoyable as the strong acting carries the day and the comedy.  At the end of the movie though, you will have to wonder how such impressive talent created something so throughly mediocre.",1252368000,,1333,4.937219730941704

I don't think there's much that's 'sweet' about biohazard removal, and I can unequivocally say that since films about former high school cheerleader-single moms from Albuquerque who become crime scene cleanup technicians in order to send their children to private school don't exactly come down the pike every day, I fail to see how this is exactly a hackneyed concept, either. As Rose, the former toast of high school who finds that life after graduation has not lived up to its early promise, Amy Adams finds the heart and soul in a damaged woman who could easily be dismissed as a vapid airhead with poor judgement in men without the soulful vulnerability she brings. Emily Blunt also plays against her usual more glamorous persona as younger sister Norah, a habitual screw-up with a drug problem who still lives at home because she can't hold onto a job. Together these two undertake the dirtiest of all dirty jobs for some quick cash, but find that it will test their preconceived notions of themselves and each other to their limits. This small film is so quirky, it's a wonder it got made, really, or attracted rising stars like Adams and Blunt, but thank goodness it did--they really are believable as sisters still working through their long-standing rivalry and a long-ago childhood tragedy.

The struggle of the two sisters was quite realistically depicted and there were a few faintly humorous moments along the way, but the whole secondary thing about the dead mother seemed clumsy and to no particular purpose, as did the relationship with the married cop boyfriend.

3806330,4,B001UV4XHE,"Amy Adams is a struggling single mom with a bright kid that she wants to send to private school.  When her no-good cop boyfriend (Steve Zahn) suggests she can make some easy money by cleaning up crime/death scenes...she launches a niche business with her ne'er-do-well sister (Emily Blunt) called SUNSHINE CLEANING.  Sometimes helping her and sometimes standing in her way is her slightly nutty father (Alan Arkin).  Gentle humor and mild drama ensue.

That's about it.  SUNSHINE CLEANING has a wonderful cast, with nearly all members contributing understated and deft performances.  The movie is set in Albuquerque, New Mexico (my town!)...so that's an extra plus for me (but probably not you...we mostly see poor neighborhoods of the city and very little of the beauty).  The story is quirky, and the details behind crime scene cleanup are unusual enough to generate some interest.

SUNSHINE CLEANING (from many of the folks who brought us LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE) lacks heft.  The performances are understated and so is the whole movie.  The script does not allow for big laughs, nor does it encourage truly dramatic moments.  It's characters are all damaged in some way, but the writer & director seem to have said, ""let's not do anything too over the top here...real life is mostly quiet moments.""  Which leads to a film that made me smile often, sometimes at something mildly funny and sometimes at something gently tender.

Adams is the heart of the film.  She simply cannot be less than charming as a performer, and she has some nice scenes.  Early in the film, she comforts an elderly person in whose house a family member has just died.  She has a natural, comforting manner that doesn't feel forced, and we see what a decent person she is.  Emily Blunt is the grit of the film.  Her character has never really settled down...to a job, a home, a path.  You sense her understanding that she's been a bit of a failure and you also sense her resentment at the fact that everyone around her can't help but feel a bit superior.  Putting these two ladies together was a great idea...the film could hardly fail altogether.  Adams has had many great roles in her short career; Blunt is still awaiting something that truly puts all her skills to the test.  Even her great work in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA simply primed me to see her REALLY dig into something.  It hasn't quite happened yet, but she's very good.

Steven Zahn is affable as a guy who fools around on his wife...but his part is a dead-end.  Clifton Collins Jr. as a slightly disabled cleaning supply store operator does a very delicate job in his interactions with Adams and her son.  He's another terrific actor (see CAPOTE) still in search of an ideal role.

Sadly, it is Alan Arkin that let me down the most.  First of all, his part is written to make him the father in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE again...only MORE so.  The eccentricities from that film are practically mental illness in this film.  He jumps constantly from one ridiculous get-rich-quick scheme to another and seems to care not one wit for the effect he has on others.  And Arkin seems to be phoning it in.  He's the kind of actor that usually seems exactly the same in every part he plays...yet he finds the most subtle nuances that can turn his work from caricature to brilliance.  I've never understood quite how he does it.  In SUNSHINE CLEANING...he doesn't do it.  While he isn't actively offensive in the role, and just found myself not believing him.

All in all, this unambitious little film is not a bad way to spend an evening.  I just wish the creators had dared to do a little more.",1252022400,,3618,4.685714285714286

What more can you ask for?  Perhaps, a story that's not so predictable and characters that I care about.

Storyline: two down and out sisters, one a single mom with a small boy whom she keeps pawning off, on whoever, so that she can sneak off with married cop(Steve Zahn- stereotyped) who's obviously using her- what's new?; the other sister, even more of a deadbeat, irresponsible type, lives in angst with worthless encounters and no apparent future.  Throw in Dad(Arkin) shining as the not-very-good-at-it salesman, and of course, add a bit of quirkiness- since the sisters discover a financial calling- cleaning up after morbid, crime scenes.

It's not a comedy.  There are a few humerous points, very few, and you can see that they're heading the story from dismal to a less dismal and somewhat happy, resolution at the end.  Ho-hum.

I'll credit them good morals to the tale:  1)One's self-worth is not determined by what job one does and/or 2) one's self-worth should not be determined by how one thinks others perceive them.

I can only blame the scriptwriter for having squandered a wonderful opportunity. Sunshine Cleaning should have had everything going for it. A great idea for the story and a fabulous cast were simply let down by a mediocre script. It was if the film began with several story lines, but then half of them had to be abandoned because of time constraints (perhaps they're on the cutting room floor and we'll have to wait for the extended version to be released).

This surely has to be the only possible reason for the under-utilised peripheral cast members. What did the one-armed shopkeeper (Clifton Collins Jr) add to the story. Just when it appeared that he was about to contribute some warmth, closeness and genuine friendship to Rose's life - he just disappears. The father (Alan Arkin) who absolutely shone in Little Miss Sunshine, was barely to be seen. The character of Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub) who comes in offering so much potential in her connection with Norah - just walks out, never to be seen again. Surely, it would have contributed to the story had she and Norah reconnected. Perhaps they could have done the road trip together.

The film's resolution, with father selling the house etc. looked like a formula approach borrowed from a dozen other films from the past. Sorry folks! the script just didn't do it for me. All I can say is thank goodness for Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. Without their wonderful performances, this film would have sunk without a trace.

I notice that Anchor Bay has included trailers for Last Chance Harvey and The Visitor. Both are top films that generate truckloads of empathy. Perhaps the writer of Sunshine Cleaning should take a look.",1251936000,,1843,4.825949367088608
3806333,3,B001UV4XHE,"Amy Adams is fast becoming one of the most interesting actors to appear on our screens for some time. She is undeniably appealing and attractive but she doesn't shirk more difficult roles, as in her superb performance in ""Junebug.""

This movie sees her taking the role of Rose, the older sister in a dysfunctional family, cut adrift (SPOILER WARNING) by the suicide of the mother. Rose is the responsible sister, a single mother working hard as a house cleaner to support her young son, Oscar, while keeping an eye on the younger sister Norah, also well-portrayed by Emily Blunt.

Alan Arkin is their father and gives a great performance as a loving but unreliable grandfather, still trying to hit it big with various silly business ventures.

Norah is a walking disaster, losing jobs, incapable even of babysitting Oscar is a responsible way. But Rose has also come adrift. She was once the head of the high school cheerleading squad and girlfriend to the quarterback. Now, she rushes to squalid assignations with that same ex-quaterback in nasty motel rooms. He's Oscar's father but he married someone else.

Where did Rose go wrong? How and why did she go offtrack? We aren't told but it feels fake. A character like Rose is built for success, not failure.

When the opportunity arises to start a business (Sunshine Cleaning) that cleans up houses and offices after violent deaths have occurred, Rose seizes it as a chance for redemption both for herself and Norah. For a while things go well but then disaster strikes.

This movie at its heart is about a family torn asunder by a suicide and its attempts to heal itself. The acting is good but the plot is very cliche-ridden. I was able to predict almost every development several steps ahead. And the end feels a bit cheap and easy. It's not a bad way to spend an evening but it doesn't have much staying power.",1251936000,,1866,4.726153846153847
3806334,4,B001UV4XHE,"There are mega movie blockbusters that beat down the doors of the local multiplex, pushing the competition out with promises of big bucks and taking over 10 of 18 screens at one shot. Sure, this means that the movie in question will be able to handle all comers the first weekend. But what about the little guy? What about the small independent movies that don't garner big budget advertising or multiple screens? These films play art houses and special theaters. Or they arrive on DVD with the chance to be found. SUNSHINE CLEANING is one such film.

We all have dreams of where we want to go with out lives. Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) was the head cheerleader, the girl most likely to succeed, the one in love with the big man on campus. Those dreams died and she moved on, becoming a single mother who works for a house cleaning service to make ends meet. She continues to see Mac (Steve Zahn), her knight in shining armor and now a homicide cop, but he's married with children and unlikely to leave.

When Rose's son Oscar (Jason Spevack) becomes more than the local school can handle, Rose must find a way to not only do better for herself but to be able to afford a private school for her son. During one of their liaisons, Mac suggest to her she start her own cleaning business cleaning crime scenes. The pay is great and she has time for her son.

After thinking it over, Rose takes on the task and recruits her sister Norah (Emily Blunt) to help. But Norah has problems of her own, mainly a rebellious streak that stems from Rose being overprotective and having to deal with a never present mother. But she goes with the flow and helps out Rose, making money for herself as well.

The pair start slowly with tips from Mac about which scenes to go to first. Stopping in a local warehouse cleaning supply store, Rose makes friends with the owner, a one armed shop keeper named Winston (Clifton Collins Jr.). Seeing the problems they are having, Winston helps her along the way with suggestions about cleaning supplies and classes she might want to take.

Their first job is one that almost makes them give in. A trailer whose owner died several days before being found, Rose and Norah do the job at hand. As they clean, Norah finds a fanny pack that belonged to the home's owner that contains a packet of pictures tied with a bow of a young girl from childhood to graduation, a treasure. It hits Norah that this woman held on to these pictures for a reason and rather than toss them out, she holds on to them and searches for the woman in the photos.

The business goes well at first and Rose seems to be getting along fine. But a chance encounter with an old school chum just before she left her old job leaves her feeling hollow and disappointed in the life she expected but that never came to be. Invited to the woman's baby shower, she makes a point of planning to attend to relive her glory days with the women she knew then.

Norah seeks out the young woman and finds her in a staling type way. They become friends without the woman knowing the real reason for her meeting Norah. The resolution to this friendship is unexpected and more real than one would think.

The chance to make it big comes with a call from State Farm Insurance who wants to hire Sunshine Cleaning for a job. Excited by the prospect, Rose shrugs off her responsibilities to go to the shower and sends Norah to do a job by herself. Face it, a happy ending is not waiting around the corner. Perhaps.

The movie does a great job of storytelling, not only moving along at a nice pace but giving us characters who feel real and who we can care about as it unfolds. Rose is a determined woman who wants the best out of life but for some reason just can't seem to reach the goals she sets for herself. Adams does a fantastic job as Rose, bringing home the despair and hope seen in the character from one moment to the next.

Emily Blunt does an outstanding job as well, offering a sister with problems that began years ago searching for the answers the questions she's not even quite sure she knows to ask. A history that involves the girl's mother and what became of her results in one of the most touching images towards the end of the film.

SUNSHINE CLEANING may not be everyone's cup of tea. It's low key, it feels like it's in the real world we want to escape while watching a movie, but at the same time it offers hope and a spark of life seen in few films. This may not be the biggest or most expensive film released this week, but it is one that has plenty of heart in its center and worth giving a watch.",1251763200,17,4593,4.360233918128655
3806335,4,B001UV4XHE,"I wanted to laugh, but I didn't do much of that. Instead of a wacky one-liner rich film, Sunshine Cleaning has a pensive and heavier quirk. There is a bit of dark humor along the lines of Little Miss Sunshine. But Sunshine Cleaning is heavier. The familial connections tying the group together bind as tightly as those in Little Miss Sunshine and they are as dysfunctional. Interactions between family members border on fun at times, but there is an overall malaise that takes away from the lightness, and makes the sunshine anemic at best.

Two sisters tainted by the loss of a mother, and the memories of her, blunder through life. It doesn't help that their father is lost in his own stupor and dreams and is mostly unavailable to them. One sister (Rose- Amy Adams) has goals but settles for a married high school sweetheart. She meets with him while her sister babysits. Both sisters know the what's going on but they pretend that Rose is taking college classes. Norah (Emily Blunt) is angry and haunted. Dad/Grandpa/Alan Arkin plays the part of the loving but screwy dad/grandpa not unlike the one that he played so well in Little Miss Sunshine. He's not a dirty old man in this version, which was appreciated.

The family grows through the opportunity to make scads of money doing what most wouldn't even consider, cleaning up after death. Instead of money, they find something more valuable...self-respect. Mature themes, several F-Bombs. Some gore. A few sex scenes, one rather sudden one.

Sunshine Cleaning is well cast and the actors, especially Emily Blunt, shine in these multi-dimensional character studies.

Creative film, great acting, interesting character study. But not quite what I expected. If you are looking for laughs, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",1251763200,,1773,4.97972972972973
3806336,5,B001UV4XHE,"My wife wanted to see this film for months based on the trailer, I am thinking typical ""chick flick"" as I didn't see the trailer.  My lady gets kudos to her for picking out a film that we both enjoyed thoroughly. I was pleasantly surprised at how real these characters were and the movie actually made me smile at the end.

It was a little predictable in the writing (what isn't) but I appreciated how the characters had flaws as most films try too hard to give you some false sense of security at the end.  I do understand that most people don't want to watch real life on film as they live it every day but it is nice to switch it up from time to time.  I don't have to watch a film and fall in love with ""tragic characters"" if I want to do that I will watch a chick flick.  It is very rare that film makers just make a movie about something that hasn't been touched upon too much (the people that clean up after deaths and suicide.

SPOILERS!!!

This movie is about the selfish act of suicide and the impact it has on the people you leave behind.  Yeah, they cleaned up dead people's houses and there were a couple of pokes at humor in this film but I would really classify this film as a drama.  Amy Adams films are usually geared toward one demographic and it was nice to see her in a different light.  I also enjoyed Emily Blunt's Performance as the perpetual loser that needed to find a way to cope with her mother's death and had no outlet.  Alan Arkin was barely recognizable in this movie but he gave a good performance.  Clifton Collins Jr. is a great actor and just about every film I have seen him in he is outstanding, he plays an Industrial Cleaning Shop Owner with one arm and an affinity for building models.  He didn't have a big role in this film but when he was on screen he overshadowed the others by far IMHO.  I recommend this film to anyone that wants to watch a film about how life has its ups and downs and how families struggle with life and death.  I would rate this at 4 1/2 stars due to the lack of original writing when it came to predictability on the ending but we will round up in this instance.

3806357,2,B001UV4XHE,"I really wanted to like this film but sadly I cannot say if it is worth purchasing. I have purchased many films on Amazon and never had a problem with them playing, I did this one. Amazon needs to rethink the return policy on bad transferred disks.  It skipped through all of it.

 On what I did see (which was like watching TV with commercial breaks) was very slow. I did not see much humor except the cat and fire episode with Blunt at the home that Ms Blunt was cleaning alone. I truly like Emily Blunt and her ability to make tragical situations seem comical. Amy Adams was so concerned about what others thought of her that I did not like her. If that is what they were going for it was done brilliantly. Alan Arkin had very little in this film, except he helped pull off the dysfunctional relationship that this and many (all) families have. It had cute moments. I see why it was not at the theaters long before DVD release.

3806358,5,B001UV4XHE,"A family is torn apart by the tragic death of one of its members.  Meet the Lorkowskis of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Joe, the father, is an annoying salesman who markets everything from candy to shrimp; his big money making schemes always go awry.  The eldest daughter Rose was a popular cheerleader in high school who now cleans the homes of her wealthy classmates; she has been having a long-term affair with her high school sweetheart, Mac, who decided to marry someone else.  A single mom, Rose struggles to raise her son, Oscar, who is being kicked out of public school for disruptive behavior.  Her sister Norah has a wandering spirit and has just lost another job.  Desperate for money, Rose asks her sister to join her in Sunshine Cleaning - a biohazard removal and crime scene cleanup operation.  Initially, the girls don't know what they are doing and there are hilarious consequences.  Eventually, after much experience, they learn the proper protective clothing to wear and they turn Sunshine Cleaning into a lucrative, emotionally satisfying business.  Rose and Norah learn how to deal compassionately with those who have experienced the deaths of loved ones and to heal their own wounds.  Despite the death of a loved one, we must make the most of our own lives.

  Death is a part of life.  Everyone must deal with it at some point in their life.  The most tragic deaths are those that come unexpected, such as a suicide.  Because of many questions that can never be answered, family members may feel bitterness and anger towards God and the one who died.  ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a very emotional, very provocative look at tragic death and how people learn to cope with it.  Not only death, but life-altering accidents as well.  One of my favorite characters is Winston who lost his arm in a motorcycle accident.  However, he continues to be a happy, productive member of society; he hasn't allowed his handicap to discourage him.  On the contrary, he offers encouragement, comfort and advice to Rose as she struggles with her foundling business and raising Oscar.  Also, Winston enjoys gluing together the pieces of models.  Indeed, ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is rich with symbolism and characters, most of which you will like despite their human flaws.  I grew to admire and respect the Lorkowski family for fighting to stay together and make Sunshine Cleaning a success.  I enjoyed watching Rose's character change from being emotionally dependant on her boyfriend, Mac, to becoming more self reliant.  It was surprising to learn that Norah wasn't the selfish wildcat that I originally thought but was actually quite compassionate and sensitive, albeit a little clumsy.  The Lorkowskis will make you laugh with their foibles.

  A top notch cast of stars can be found in ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  Everyone's acting was superb.  Amy Adams (Rose) and Emily Blunt (Norah) looked and acted remarkably like sisters.  Blunt is one of the reasons I so badly wanted to watch this film.  This gorgeous young woman is awesome at portraying a variety of different characters.  I liked her as the snooty office assistant in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and as the frightened college student in ""Wind Chill.""  In ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" Blunt has this rough, wild exterior but a soft, gentle heart that is burdened with raging, pent up emotions and unanswered questions.  The actors who ""stole the show"" were the adorable child actor Jason Spevack as Oscar and the likeable Clifton Collins Jr. as Winston.  It was a treat to watch Robert Redford's daughter, Amy Redford, in a cameo as Mac's wife Heather.  The scene where she tells Rose she knows about the affair is one of the best in the film.

  ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is just one in a series of many emotional, poignant films that Anchor Bay Entertainment has recently released.  They have provided trailers for several others including:  ""Last Chance Harvey,"" ""Henry Poole Is Here,"" ""The Visitor"" and ""Sleepwalking.""  There is also a trailer for the comedy ""Table for Three.""  Excellent documentary is provided by producer Glenn Williamson (""Little Miss Sunshine"") and script writer Megan Holley.  The people of Albuquerque must be extremely friendly for allowing the film crew to shoot most of the scenes inside and outside actual locales.  The sporting goods store, the elementary school, the candy store and the blood bank were just a few.  I was thrilled to learn that the actor portraying Winston actually has two arms.  It was either tucked behind his back during shooting or digitally removed during the editing process.  One of my favorite features is ""A Fresh Look at a Dirty Business.""  It consists primarily of an interview with two wonderful women who are actually in the business of biohazard removal and crime scene cleanup.  It was very educational in that they described the type of equipment used for maintaining proper safety and hygiene.  Also, they spoke about the emotional comfort they provided to the relatives of the deceased.  I never realized how rewarding this business could be.  During some of the scenes, I became teary eyed while thinking about what the victims' families had suffered and how these women had entered into their lives to help and console them so that the last memories they had of their loved ones were not tarnished and ugly ones.

  If you enjoy emotional, family drama, then you must watch ""Sunshine Cleaning.""  It offers the viewer a rainbow of hope that life is worth living no matter how difficult it may seem.

3806359,4,B001UV4XHE,"I expected a quirky movie, but sometimes movies are too self-consciously quirky, and this is a good example.  It feels like the writer, producer and director are trying too hard to be out-there.  This is a hard movie to love.

However, the cast is excellent, and it is always a pleasure to watch good actors practice their craft.  Amy Adams has the meatiest part and is the only character who really gets developed.  I gave the movie an extra star based on the performances.

One word of warning: if you are in the habit of watching movies during meals (as I am), save this one for another time.  There's some pretty gross stuff onscreen.",1251590400,,638,4.543859649122807
3806360,5,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning stars Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, and Alan Arkin, Its a small cast but has the biggest impact because of it. Its the first screenplay for writer Megan Holley and she should be utterly proud of her work on this movie, she has given us one of the sweetest films ever, with blood mixed in!

  Its the story of two sisters, Rose and Nora, and Roses little boy Oscar. Nora lives with their father Joe who is always looking for that next ""big money"" idea he can get his hands on. Rose works as a maid, while Nora is directionless, pausing now and again to baby sit Oscar and fill his head with tales of horror and mental afflictions. The family seems to revolve in different orbits, now and again aligning to alter eachothers lives in a negative way. Rose hears from her cop boyfriend one night while they meet at some seedy hotel, away from the prying eyes of others, about a lucrative business involving crime scene cleanup. He tells her that they make a ""killing"" doing it. Rose considers the job ""disgusting"" and brushes that idea off quickly. Later on, after Rose gets told by Oscars school that he will be put on mandatory medication for his behavioral problems, she yanks him out of there and has to find a way to get him into a private school. That means money, and the idea of becoming a cleaning lady for the dead seems now to be a great idea. I mean there is no bodies right, how hard can it be?

  She recruits her sister Nora as her partner, Roses cop boyfriend gets her a job using his influence, and they are thrown literally into the thick of it, the thick of blood and guts and noxious smells, liquids, and everything you can imagine that comes with suicide, murder and natural death. How does one clean up a giant blood stain? How do you get bits of brain out of carpet? What do you do with all the splattered materials you accumulate after cleaning? It was so much fun to watch all this happen, I cringed and hid my face, and laughed so hard at these two sisters figure it all out. Enter Winston (played by Clifton Collins Jr), who owns a cleaning supply business, he has one arm and a big heart and Rose has instantly made an impression on him. The sisters soon realize that there is alot more to the blody clean up business than they realize!

  I haven't been caught up in a movie like this in a long time, Rose and Nora might be two opposites but they both let their feelings bubble up to the surface and spill out in ways that made a lump in my throat and gave me a smile on my face. Amy Adams and Emily Blunt give everything to these roles, and I am forever grateful for that. Sunshine Cleaning is about finding the bright side to even the most upsetting and sad situations, finding your purpose in life and realizing you have the ability to make a difference in someones life that you didn't know you had in you, and how family takes care of their own when the world seems hell bent on bringing them down.

While they learn how to deal with this truly gruesome business, they nevertheless demonstrate a deep compassion for others and learn the value of their own particular lives.

I was expecting it to be a bit more of a humorous movie than it actually was. Of course the movie was riddled with bits of dry humor, the indie way of making people laugh, but it wasn't what I was expecting after watching the preview.

There are long scenes without a lot of dialogue, that can be a bit exasperating. There is also a lot of dramatic emotion in the film. I think that I would have liked it more had I not been misled by the trailer.

(d.) The mom to both sisters died a long time ago and the sisters haven't resolved the event yet.
(e.) Dad hasn't resolved the event yet either or raised the sisters to resolve anything.

The cast is very good, with Amy Adams and Emily Blunt turning in strong performances that keep this little flick watchable. Alan Arkin is okay here, but he is given little to do. At least he had some funny lines to work with in LMS (though he didn't deserve the Oscar). The story of two women cleaning up crime scenes sounded interesting to me when reading the description, though they didn't spend enough time dealing with that unique line of work.

3806365,4,B001UV4XHE,"Somewhere between an Indie movie and a bigger screen Hollywood production, this little gem of a flick was a pleasure to watch.  It stars Amy Adams and Emily Blunt as two sisters, both fairly n'eer-do-well.  Alan Arkin plays their father who has dreams of striking it rich quick with one scheme after another.

Amy Adams cleans houses for a living.  Emily Blunt has trouble holding on to any job.  Amy has been having an affair with a police officer whose wife is now pregnant with their second child and she just doesn't get the fact that he is not about to leave his wife for her.  He is helpful in giving her the idea to start a cleaning business that cleans up after crime scenes.  It's good money.  Amy and Emily get into this business and face several challenges that just about ruin their business.

Alan Arkin does a fine job as the father.  He has raised his two daughters alone after his wife took her own life when they were very little.  A poignant part of the movie is Emily Blunt's nostalgically remembering her mother and her painful memories of living her life without a mother.  Amy Adams, the big sister, has been responsible for Emily most of their lives.  A new-comer to the stage is the boy who plays Oscar, Amy's son.  He has a wry sense of humor and a charm that carries through to the audience.

This is a good movie - - not a great one - - but a good one.  That's saying a lot these days with the dearth of decent movies getting worse and worse.  I recommend it.",1251417600,,1486,4.326086956521739

Nora has assumed the role of slacker; Rose is the hard-working, responsible single mom (and de-facto mom for Nora).  Both are still dealing with their childhoods, which were defined by the suicide of their mother, and with their father, the great Alan Arkin, who is always trying to find a way to make a buck by selling something out of the back of his car.  When Rose needs more money than she can make as a maid, her married lover recommends she tries cleaning up crime scenes. Fortunately for us, she and Nora ineptly start ""Sunshine Cleaning"".

The movie has great insights into Nora and Rose's personalities. Nora appears to be insensitive, but she tracks down the daughter of a woman who died so she can make sure she knows of the death and that her mother carried the daughter's pictures with her.  Rose looks strong and confident, but she has affirmation post-it notes around her bathroom to boost her ego.  The characters are very well-written.

This movie has exactly the same feel as ""Little Miss Sunshine"", which was produced by the same company.  I never got the big belly laugh that I did during the dance scene at the end of LMS, but ""Sunshine Cleaning"" showed much of the same imperfect people and dysfunctional relationships of its predecessor, but with better written and more likeable characters.

Both are famiy centered dramas, of dyfunction and ultimate family unity, that allows their characters to be flawed, and real, and heartbroken from time to time. However, while Little Miss Sunshine cheered and made us laugh, this movie misses the mark, ever so slightly, despite the fine work of a cast of greats.

Inspired by a story heard on NPR about crime scene clean up artists, Sunshine Cleaning is the story of self-doubting Rose (Amy Adams) and  her directionless sister Norah (Emily Blunt), who grapple with some mysteries in their lives while trying to find themselves. Rose is a house cleaner, a onetime former beauty, A list high schooler, who finds herself a maid in a former classmates house. Reminded of her lowly status, and dealing with an out of control child who needs a private school, Rose creates a lucrative business when her occasional married fling Matt (when did Steve Zahn grow up and look so good?) sets her up on her first ""discounted"" cleanup. Needing help, she pulls Norah into the mix, and together, they form ""Sunshine Cleaning"".

The crime scenes end up being much more complex, complicated, and gory than they may have first imagined, but determined to succeed, the two grow into their roles, and thereby, growing into their lives and relationships. While Adams and Blunt act the heck out of their scenes, there still is a quiet disappointment that permeates the script, of which, I cannot quite pinpoint. Perhaps the scene with a CB radio in their cleaning van that sends words up into heaven? Perhaps the quizzical plot line involving a photo Norah finds at a crime scene and an ensuring, yet ultimately pointless, relationship with a woman? It was hard to find.

Certainly enjoyable, if only for the acting, Sunshine Cleaning is a modest film, with modest intentions, all leading to modest results.",1251331200,,2186,5.327536231884058
3806409,3,B001UV4XHE,"Sunshine Cleaning is a story about real life.  It is dark yet, realistic.  It is the story of two sisters who are trodding through life.  One sister is looking for more than what she has through infidelity and attempting to be more socially than she is.  The other is continually fired from jobs and isn't motivated to do much better.  In both of their attempts they decide to open a business cleaning up after crime scenes.  The job provides them much more income than either made before.  The story continues in a journey through their relationship as the deal with each other and events in their past.

The movie is a bit slow even for just 91 minutes.  I was hoping it would add more humor and an overall lightness to it but that doesn't really come to fruition until the last few minutes.  I really would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could, the story line isn't poor yet it isn't wowing.  Honestly I was hoping for a bit more than the movie provided.  I was left a little disappointed after watching thinking that this would be more like Little Miss Sunshine.  If you hold it to that standard, you will be let down too.",1251331200,,1122,4.36231884057971
3806410,4,B001UV4XHE,"I saw this movie simply because of its actors, and because the ""producers"" were the same as Little Miss Sunshine.

It was a cute drama. It's a subtle family drama (i.e., slow to some people) & character development film. It's not a comedy, and it's really nothing like Little Miss Sunshine (except that ""Sunshine"" is in the title). It reminded me more of the Showtime series ""Weeds"" than anything else (although not as funny).

The story is rather predictable - two women go into the business of forensic/crime cleanup, and get into trouble along the way. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer, and I'm not sure why the promotional team tried to bill this as a comedy. It's a solid drama that provides a few chuckles. It's sincere, and a cute story nonetheless.

I was disappointed that Steve Zahn and Alan Arkin were only in a few short scenes. However, the lead actors were quite strong. But without a strong script or plot, it's only 3.5 stars for me. I enjoyed watching it once, but not enough to buy it.",1251244800,,1014,4.530054644808743
3806411,2,B001UV4XHE,"SUNSHINE CLEANING is billed as a ""quirky comedy/drama.""  However, it isn't quirky, it isn't comedy, and it really isn't drama.  From the traumatic first scene to the Hollywood ending, there is not a single moment of levity.  SUNSHINE CLEANING is a series of predictable train wrecks that the viewer can see coming for miles and miles.

SUNSHINE CLEANING is the story of Rose, a single mother who works as a housekeeper.  Rose needs money to get her smart but mischievous son into a private school, since the public school can't seem to handle him.  At the suggestion of her married cop boyfriend, Rose and her deadbeat sister decide to enter the crime scene cleanup business - totally unprepared and with no knowledge of what they are doing.  The rest of the film is a chronicle of their business, their relationships, and their family.

I really wanted to like SUNSHINE CLEANING.  I usually enjoy the efforts of Alan Arkin, Amy Adams, and Emily Blunt, but the writers really let these fine actors down.  The characters are unlikable and mostly unredeemable, and the plot is plodding, depressing, and unfocused.  There is no charm, no warmth, no color, and no depth.

By the end of the film, I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters.  I was never immersed in the story; I really didn't care about it one way or the other.  SUNSHINE CLEANING is cloudy and gray, with no chance of sun.  Sorry folks, I just can't recommend this one.",1251244800,7,1441,4.708
3806412,5,B001UV4XHE,"I really enjoyed this film.  Based loosely on an interview on NPR that the writers heard with women who had a business doing precisely what the fictional sisters in the film do, it concerns two sisters who undertake a business cleaning up crime scenes in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Rose needs to send her son to a special school while her sister Norah simply needs a job.  They had lost their mother to suicide when they were small children, so taking their new jobs resonates with major events in their lives.  They end up in a job where personal tragedies -- deaths, suicides, accidents -- that are paradoxically good news for them.  A suicide initially means $500 that they didn't previously have, and after they become more skilled at their job it means a great deal more.

The film proceeds through a string of small, touching, and exquisite slices of life, people doing the small things that make up human lives.  Each scene reveals a bit more about Rose and Norah and we come to like and sympathize with each the more we learn.  Norah is revealed as a deeply scarred and damaged soul, someone who has never recovered from the horror of discovering her mother's body and her absence in her life.  Rose is less scarred, but suffers from her own disappointments, having been the head cheerleader and the best looking girl in school (she tells the owner of the cleaning supply store where she buys her tools of the trade that attracting men and cheering), but now a single mother with several years of moderate failure behind her, yearning for a genuine caring relationship with a man but persisting in an adulterous affair with her high school sweet heart.  The film ends on a note of quiet hope and reconciliation and feels very appropriate alongside the rest of the film.  My lone complaint with the film was a rather long and unsuccessful scene where Rose talks to her dead mother on a CB radio (it is a one way conversation) in the van that she and her sister have bought for work.  It was a scene that I felt neither worked nor made much sense.  A small blemish on an otherwise splendid film.

The best thing about the film is the acting.  Amy Adams as rose continues a string of amazing performances.  I still remember seeing her for the first time on BUFFY in a very small role as Tara Maclay's cousin and in a very small role in SMALLVILLE, and then later as ""The Hot Girl"" on THE OFFICE (ironically, on that show she played Jim's girlfriend for several episodes; Jim is played by John Krasinski, who in real life has been romantically involved with Emily Blunt, who plays Norah in SUNSHINE CLEANING).  She has become in my opinion one of the truly great actresses in the movies.  She is a true beauty, with her huge blue eyes and wonderfully clear skin, but what really makes her a delight is her great skills as an actress.  She seems to be able to play any kind of role and has pretty much become an actress I will see out to see in films (I want to see JULIE AND JULIA in the near future).  I've not seen Emily Blunt all that much, but I hope to see more of her in the future.  She plays Norah with heartbreaking subtlety.  I was impressed tremendously by Clifton Collins, who plays the one-armed owner of the cleaning supply store (it also seems to sell a fair number of model airplane kits -- he seems at one point to be making a model of either a B-25 or B-24, both of which I put together as a kid).  He is one of the most versatile actors working today, transforming himself into virtually any kind of role.  He also played a role in this summer's STAR TREK, but I think he was much more memorable in this film.  The rest of the cast was also superb, including Steve Zahn and 24's Mary Lynn Rajskub.  The people who made this also made LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and Alan Arkin was in both films.  He was not as superb in this one as in the earlier film, but his Oscar winning performance in that one is tough to match.

All in all, this is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in a while.  If you are looking at a vacation from the overblown summer fare we've been given this year, do yourself a favor and see this small gem of a movie.",1251244800,,4156,4.382007822685789
3806413,4,B001UV4XHE,"I thought I was going to be watching another 'quirky indie' movie, similar to 'Little Miss Sunshine', with which it shares producers and co-star Alan Arkin. Actually, while still very funny in places, it ended up being much more dramatic than expected, and a nice little film about family and growing up. Starring my new favorite actress, a dressed-down Amy Adams, and Emily Blunt as her irresponsible younger sister, it follows their adventures as they start their own business, cleaning up crime scenes. The ride takes them on several side roads, including class reunions and a strange friendship with Mary Lynn Rajskub (""Chloe"" of '24'). The overall feel reminds me of another movie I loved last year - 'Waitress'. Maybe not a wall-to-wall laugh riot, but tender and memorable, and still enough smiles to make you walk out happy.",1250640000,,832,4.9928057553956835
3806414,4,B001UV4XHE,"Amy Adams continues to show real range in her acting: I can't imagine three more different parts than hers in Enchanted, Miss Pettigrew and Sunshine Cleaning yet she carries them all off superbly.

As usual Emily Blunt is convincing especially when she is being an unpleasant (I know that sounds critical but it's not meant to be) and complex character.

If a film keeps me interested, as this one did, on an overnight transatlantic flight then I know it is good.",1249516800,,463,4.703703703703703
3806415,3,B001UV4XHE,"It is hard to hate a film like ""Sunshine Cleaning."" It is made with low budget, has interesting characters with excellent acting from the impressive cast including Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin, plus the nice location of Albuquerque. Interestingly three of the producers of ""Sunshine Cleaning"" - Jeb Brody, Peter Saraf and Marc Turtletaub - are also the producers of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (of which cast also included Alan Arkin).

To send her son to a private school, single mother Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) sets up a small company specializing in cleaning up the crime scenes with her trouble-making sister Norah (Emily Blunt). In this comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family we are introduced to a group of people (some deeply troubled, some quirky) living in Albuquerque. The film's feel-good tone, if not the entire story, may remind you of another ""Sunshine"" film.

There is nothing wrong with the film's narrative or characters. And, sorry, there is nothing special either. For all its impressive performances from the leads, I couldn't help thinking that I had seen the film somewhere else before - troubled relations between sisters and their hidden past, mother and her child who starts to behave strangely, grumpy grandfather talking about his ""business acumen"" (played by Alan Arkin who did a similar role in ""Little Miss Sunshine). Steve Zahn appears as Mac, a local police officer (and former high school hero), having an affair with Amy Adam's heroine. His acting is very good (as he always is), but his role give me a feeling of dj vu.

I am not saying ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is bad, but I can safely say the director Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia"") is wasting the promising material that could have made a much better film. Clifton Collins Jr. is Winston, a one-armed hardware store owner who gives her some good advice on the job. He is quite effective, and perhaps his role is more engaging than the main story, but the director seems to have forgotten to explore it.

""Sunshine Cleaning"" has many good premises. It is a good film though it could have made much better use of them.",1248998400,,2104,4.901685393258427
