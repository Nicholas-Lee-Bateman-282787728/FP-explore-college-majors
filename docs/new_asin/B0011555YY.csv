8240506,5,B0011555YY,I am very happy with the blu ray I have received today and they arrived on time.,1515542400,,80,3.764705882352941
8240507,5,B0011555YY,"I first saw this on TV about 1983-84, & it was dubbed into English. I taped it (on VHS), but by today's standards, the VHS format is blurry. I've been looking for a dubbed version for 25+ years but haven't been able to find one. A version I bought earlier (a Canadian release) claimed to have English subtitles, but that was not true.
The Blu-Ray version for sale here DOES have English subtitles. For me, this films still holds up all these years after first seeing it. It's witty, the acting & photography are quite good. Delon has enough confidence to satirically make fun of himself in this film, when his film Girlfriend compares him negatively with Belmondo! The soundtrack is excellent as well (I love Oscar Benton's 1973 song, ""Bensonhurst Blues"", used often in this film). My favorite film by Delon.",1506384000,,808,4.697183098591549
8240508,4,B0011555YY,"Alain Delon is cool and suave as ever! In ""Pour la peau d'un flic"" (""For A Cop's Hide"" from 1981, in a vehicle where he stars, writes, and directs), Alain Delon is 'Choucas', a tough ex-cop turned private-investigator; searching for a missing girl, where the connection eventually leads to his old colleagues on the force. There's plenty of action and thrills, and a young and beautiful Anne Parillaud (as 'Charlotte'), is along for the ride (She was his ""main squeeze"" at the time).

Alain Delon, does a very decent job as actor and director, in his own self-deprecating way of course. With lots of fun, thrills, laughs, and plenty of car-chases as well (in an age before the horrible CGI took over the industry). The musical score is pretty good too.

The DVD picture and sound quality by Path&eacute; is excellent, the film has been fully restored (this DVD release, 2015). PAL format, French (English subtitles), FFN, NR 102 mins. (BTW: I bought the DVD through Amazon.fr for 5.41 euros.)

Love and Peace,

8240510,5,B0011555YY,It was in perfect condition. They gave accurate discription for playback ability for the U.S.. I got just what I thought I was going to get.,1393286400,,140,4.423076923076923
8240511,4,B0011555YY,"A former cop turned private investigator, Choucas (Alain Delon), visited by Madame Pigot split who asks for help finding her daughter who has disappeared. But the client is murdered and he Choucas receives threats. N The research initially seemed routine will be complicated ...

Intelligent script that makes a nod to Belmondo and pays tribute to Fritz Lang's M, when one sings of the involved in the matter sings the well known chorus of Peer Gynt, the same that Peter Lorre whistled in the aforementioned movie.

Anne Parrillaud is splendid in his role, and Alain Delon surprising behind the scenes in his dual role as actor and director.

Entertaining film with spectacular sequences like the chase back on the highway.

Watch it. Do not be disappointed.",1314576000,,758,4.992063492063492
