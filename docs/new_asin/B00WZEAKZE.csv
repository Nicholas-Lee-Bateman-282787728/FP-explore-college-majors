7155369,5,B00WZEAKZE,"Writer Paul Abbott has fashioned a modern, punchy, funny and entertaining police series full of lowest common denominator examples of human behaviour as a likeable team of cops headed by a fairly gross bottle blonde with a heart (sometimes) investigate the disappearance of a number of young women with Down's Syndrome. When someone who looks Down's Syndrome has to go undercover to lure the killer the pace quickens and the shocks and black humour continue. The pacy direction, racy scripting and a top notch cast of talented actors, including the Down's Syndrome cast, make for rivetting viewing. This review is limited to Series One which will be difficult to top.",1486944000,5,667,5.072727272727272
7155370,5,B00WZEAKZE,"Superb new series , Season 2 just can't come soon enough !",1473552000,,58,3.9166666666666665
7155371,4,B00WZEAKZE,"While it's not the UK equivalent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B00UCOXZLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>, this is a smart detective serial that's maybe worth your time (it was worth mine). Here are a few points to consider:

 Don't let the classification of ""dramedy"" fool you: Yes, the humor is nearly constant, but keep in mind a serial killer preying on girls with Down syndrome is at the center of the plot.

 You'll probably want to use the English subtitles, because the accents are rather thicker than us Yanks are accustomed to from other Brit shows.

 As the DVD cover art suggests, there are 3 primary ""lady fuzz"" characters: Dinah, Joy, and Vivienne.

 Vivienne (Joanna Scanlan) is the foul-mouthed Detective Inspector for our heroines. She doesn't take guff from anyone and is not afraid to verbally accost the Superintendent while he is taking a leak.

 Dinah (Elaine Cassidy) is the Detective Constable and would be considered the protagonist if we had to choose only 1 character. I don't want to say Elaine Cassidy was miscast because she's drop dead gorgeous, but if she were a real constable she'd probably be the world's most fetching one. I'm not complaining: she does a bang up job and is a pleasure to gaze upon.

 Joy (Alexandra Roach) is the new Detective Sergeant who sometimes lacks confidence. Alexandra Roach is one of the main characters in the outrageously marvelous Brit series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Utopia/dp/B00B2OI0FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Utopia</a>, which was unfortunately canceled after two seasons.

 Colin Salmon plays the Detective Superintendent... hey, he's Ollie Queen's ex-stepfather! (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arrow/dp/B00BGI086Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arrow</a>)

 The music for the show is not all that fitting for a Manchester cop show, imo. Oh well, not every serial can have music as good as Utopia's.

 No Offence was renewed for a season 2.

7155373,5,B00WZEAKZE,"Manchester bad-arse crimes rip apart gripping scenes.
This series will catch you off your guard.
Do NOT expect purity among the police force.
You get a little humor mixed in with the blood. At times you LOL and other times turn your head at the disgust of the crimes and policing. Thats due to very fine acting and writing; you're intended to feel that way. There are several highly recognizable seasoned actors filling the lead roles, such as Elaine Cassidy (The Paradise), Alexandra Roach (Iron Lady), Paul Ritter (Vera), Will Mellor (Broadchurch), Charlie May-Clark (Death Comes to Pemberley) and more with Joanna Scanlan leading the cop force, and shes a force to be reckoned with. Episodes have changing cases and personal life events, but a Downs Syndrome case permeates the series.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes and bonus materials.
[1] == A botched arrest by DC Dinah costs a promotion. She makes a significant body connection to a serial killer.
[2] == A teen overdose inquiry finds an uncommon source. DC Dinah & DS Joy go undercover as party gals. Victim Cathy bunks with a cop.
[3] == A fire bomb with a death may need added investigation even after the undercover wedding grooms arrest.
[4] == Suicide victim witnessed by DC Dinah and theres another Downs victim threat.
[5] == A stabbing is a new case while ongoing serial killer case puts forensics cop Miller into odd undercover.
[6] == An injured man in a locked bin, and an attacker foot-to-auto chase. Connection to serial case? Inside leak?
[7] == DC Dinah & DI Viv contemplates a cop mole. Also a new jogger homicide to solve.
[8] == Rapist ID adds conflict as well as other policing malfunctions. Yes, a volatile ending, but staging the next season.",1531958400,3,1725,4.769230769230769

7155377,5,B00WZEAKZE,"This is an exceptionally different take on the police shows. It dosent get bogged down in the misery or drama that usually happens in procedurals. There is no wounded detective or magically brilliant hero. They are crass, sarcastic and the stories move in unexpected ways. Give it a shot, it starts of running out the gate.

7155387,5,B00WZEAKZE,"I am from Manchester. but lived in the U.S for almost 20 years now. Loved the grittiness of this show, the humor (which may not be to some viewer's taste!) and the strong female leads. ""Viv"" was almost comedic in some of her scenes, but it was realistic at the same time. I agree with another viewer who said that although the storyline is very dark at times, we didn't actually SEE any gruesomeness, which is a refreshing change these days. Instead of graphic scenes, it is left to your imagination, as you follow the various characters and sub plot lines. Thank you for this!

7155388,5,B00WZEAKZE,"This is the type of show that emphasises the superior British detective gendre; a woman driven police procedural with outstanding actors not focused on husband or children.  Quoting a previous reviewer, ""the driving force are the entertaining, irresistible threesome: Joanna Scanlin as DI ""Viv,"" Elaine Cassidy as DC ""Dinah"" (so great in ACCEPTABLE RISK, ) and Alexandra Roach as DS ""Joy.""

7155392,5,B00WZEAKZE,"Intelligent, fast-paced and very entertaining show. Best female cop characters since Prime Suspect. Don't be put off by the description of 'filthily funny"" - it's not a comedy nor is it filthy. There is some salty language and gritty plot lines, but that's par for a cop show. What's special about it is the fast pace, the twists and turns, the great female leads and the tensions between doing what's morally right, or playing by the book. There is a lot of depth to these characters, and plot lines that run the length of the series, giving lots of time for development. Things never drag, it's not hard to follow, and each episode ends on a cliff hanger which makes it perfect for binging. And, unlike so many shows, the last episode provides a satisfying conclusion. I hope there are more series to come!",1526688000,2,808,4.618055555555555

I think of comedy in detective series to be that of the Last Detective, or Vexed (also fabulous)... so that's what I was 'expecting' and it's more the drama-story-line side... well, matters not, as it's a hit all around.

7155417,5,B00WZEAKZE,"Unbelievably disturbing, but especially so as the series is in the final episode.
I actually found it went along in a normal range of horrific for a British crime series until the last episode when it was about as bad as this kind of story can get.
No spoilers here, just saying this is not as benign as it appears to be.
Whatever lightness it has is eclipsed by the final darkness.
Not so visually horrific, a deeper horror: how incredibly depraved and disturbed someone can be.

However, the captions for the Deaf are only available on some episodes. Why?! It's not a matter of dialect, but access. Please fix this Acorn TV or Amazon video.

1. The characters, especially the police, but others too have nearly zero credibility/believability in their roles. By their physical appearance; by their talk; by their inconsistent non-professional behaviors; by their intelligence (especially police sleuthing & case forensics).
2. Lots of inexcusable on-case contaminating or overlooking procedure behaviors. Who wrote this script?
3. Lots of stereotypes in casting; lots of made-up squabbles that seem to be the norm in made-for-TV crime series. A rather impoverished ""New Tricks"" knockoff. The periodic little gathering of detectives for updates, assignments seemed like a middle school gathering for a field trip.

8714625,5,B00WZEAKZE,"It's billed as a comedy, but that's really an oversimplification.  The comic touches can get pretty gross, and include episodes of urination, defecation, vomiting, and masturbation. There is also some good, old-fashioned shagging. The semi-comic, semi-serious tone is successfully maintained throughout the first six episodes, but the last two, and particularly the last one, grow quite dark. The women who are central to the story, three of them police officers, perform vigilante justice on a particularly horrible villain. He gets what he deserves, but in the process the law is circumvented/broken. This is not the typical ending of a ""police"" series.  Well, I enjoyed it, despite some weaknesses in the writing towards the end, and I appreciated, for the most part, the out-of-the-box elements.

The Manchester accents and rapid-fire dialogue means that we Yanks are likely to miscomprehend or miss out on some of the exchanges. The basic elements of the story line remain clear, however.",1533513600,,993,5.352564102564102

8714628,4,B00WZEAKZE,"As I post this review, the US release of this TV series which aired on British commercial TV in 2015, is still 10 days from seeing its release in US on NTSC format from Acorn. I was provided with an advance screener in exchange for an objective review that I hope is helpful.
If youve read my other reviews on Amazon you will know that Im a huge fan of British (or Irish or Scottish) crime and mystery series produced by the BBC or ITV , which air on US TV on either BBC America or PBS.  I really prefer the home video versions because nearly every one of this shows has been edited (for either language or extreme violence  often both  and maybe even brief nudity). I prefer the original.

Im also a big proponent of not providing episode plot summaries (as some do in their reviews here) because IMHO it spoils the enjoyment. And I most certainly don't like spoilers, so you rarely  if ever  will find one in my reviews. After all, these are called mysteries for a reason. So, I encourage you to avoid reviews with way too many details.
With that said, I really wanted to like this series and the three main female characters are fascinating to watch. But, as the Creator Paul Abbott (responsible for shameless and State of Play says in a bonus feature (no spoiler here) I wanted this to be unlike any other show. Well, it certainly is. Each of the eight episodes (about 48 minutes each) has its own crime to be solved, but there is one main crime which connects the episodes together (and is solved at the end). It concerns a serial killer who rapes and murders (violently) young girls with Downs Syndrome. Pretty depressing, eh? Well Abbott turns the story into a cop/crime drama and slapstick comedy! Yes you read that right. You feel for the victims and, when you least expect it, physical comedy ensues. It is a bit jarring and that is why I can only give it a four star rating. The acting is great  though I found the casting a bit odd. Youll see why when you watch it  no, Im not telling you why.

British commercial TV is much more liberal in language and bathroom humor than US TV is so be prepared for strong language and potty humor (though no nudity appears). There are some pretty graphic violence scenes.

The DVD contains an 11 min Meet the cast and crew featurette (where I got the Abbott quote from) and 11 minutes of deleted Scenes (which didn't add much for me.

Be aware that each episode is preceded by an Episode Summary. I recommend that you skip these as there are plot spoilers included
When the last episode ended I wondered if there would be a Series 2. The conclusion made me hard to think some of the main characters would return. But, yes (SMALL spoiler alert) there was a second season (released in the UK) and my guess is that Acorn will bring it to us in the near future.

So, if you are a fan of Acorn mystery DVDs, you may enjoy this one. Though not the best of their releases, the cast is one that you will find yourself rooting for. Just remember, this a different kind of series. (Creators words)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
