8336596,3,B001QVKPJS,Direct copies from TV. Which means the quality is much less than you expect. But unavaiable elsewhere and Phil Silvers IS funny.,1391040000,,128,4.863636363636363
8336597,1,B001QVKPJS,"This is nothing but a ripoff. Recieved it and the package was damaged, The box was a cheap piece of garbage made for more DVDs then what was in the package. The outside cover should have given it away. The labeling looked like it was done by a home computer. After doing research I didn't even watch them. I was looking for quality like the 1st season legit copy. I had already owned a bootleg copy and wanted the real thing. Buyer beware and save your time till the legit copies come out.",1375574400,3,489,4.268817204301075
8336598,1,B001QVKPJS,"These are poor-quality rip-offs from TV broadcasts, not the seasons issued by the copyright holding studio. Don't waste your money on this garbage. I'm surprised Amazon sells it pretending such shoddy products. But, then, they'll sell anything for a profit.",1334707200,12,257,5.45
8336599,1,B001QVKPJS,"The good:  Phil Silvers is awesome.  His comic genius never fails to disappoint in this classic television series about the cunning Sergeant Bilko, the ultimate con man.
The bad:  This DVD set is a bootleg.  The videos are all grainy recordings off of Nick at Night (they all have the ""TV LAND"" logo in the lower right corner).  Due to poor editing, many of them chop off parts of scenes right before or after commercial breaks.  I was thoroughly disappointed with this product, and I hope that whoever owns the intellectual property rights sues the pants off this vendor.",1334534400,14,572,4.7272727272727275
8336600,2,B001QVKPJS,"I've purchased all three sets of the Phil Silvers (Bilko) show through amazon.com.  They were made by ""Classic Sitcoms"" of Canada.  Unfortunately, the quality is, at best, indifferent.  They were recorded off someone's cable television system, and while the picture quality is generally decent, some episodes start and stop abruptly--occasionally with the loss of program material.  Now that official studio-produced versions are coming out (the first season will be released in July 2010), I'd stay away from these ""home-made"" DVDs.",1276387200,39,533,5.625
