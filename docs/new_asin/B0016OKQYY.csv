8263626,2,B0016OKQYY,"I am a huge fan of UFO Files. What I like about this show is that very often they investigate cases that are not well known, like the UFO Crash in China or the case of Shag Harbour. I've learned a lot just by watching the show.

This episode of UFO Files is, in my opinion, one of the worst episode in the history of the show. Why this episode have its own DVD is beyond me. The cases investigated in this episode are boring, not interesting and very disappointing. I mean there are so many supposed ""Alien Encounters"" each and every year and this is the best they could do ?? Also the reenactment of the events are so badly done that at one point I was laughing.

This is by far one of the weakest episode of UFO Files. I really hope that one day The History Channel will release all the episodes on DVD. Don't buy this DVD, it's a waste of time and money.",1309046400,7,857,4.095238095238095
