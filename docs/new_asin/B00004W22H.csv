1359387,4,B00004W22H,"This is easily the most watchable these pre-Diana Rigg episodes will ever get, but technically they still aren't a patch on the 4th season on up. Cameras bashing into things, boom mikes not being lowered in time, fight scenes underlit, dead body shots edited too abruptly, etc. The stories themselves aren't too bad(except for the ones featuring the utterly useless Venus Smith, where everything stops dead whenever she sings),but require more of an attention span than needed for the Emma Peel eps. The biggest problem is that A&E mixes all the 1963 eps together on these sets, meaning that you'll find 2nd and 3rd season stories n the same DVDs, making strict sequential viewing difficult and expensive.",1167782400,3,705,5.034188034188034
1359388,5,B00004W22H,"I am hooked on this series! Each season is special in its own way. The Honor Blackman episodes are really special; early televsion, flaws and all. If you want to see this sort of thing, you have it here. All the flowery words in the world won't do it justice. This is intelligent, witty, stylish stuff. Buy it.",1128902400,4,310,4.362068965517241
1359389,5,B00004W22H,"Yes, let me say it again-short and sweet-unlike all the other reviewers who write pages and pages- This series -from start to finish- is a Work of Art! Own it!",1027728000,6,159,4.333333333333333
1359390,5,B00004W22H,"If you relish a series like ""Honey West,"" ""Peter Gunn"" or ""77 Sunset Strip"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John Steed (Patrick Macnee) might say to Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Cathy Gale are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good.",972000000,2,576,4.548076923076923
1359391,4,B00004W22H,"When A&E began to make available the almost legendary Cathy Gale episodes instead of the Tara King ones (for which I had voted), I found myself somewhat disappointed with them. The pace at which many of the episodes were performed during that 1964 season was often very slow before Honor Blackman went off to join James Bond and Diana Rigg became the pin-up queen of the world of undercover agents.
  The six episodes of the <Avengers '63, Set 1> (AEE 70076) are considerably more interesting, if just a bit more difficult to hear due to slightly fuzzier sound and more primitive microphone techniques. And while in the '64 set A&E had let an intrusive fly get between the original tapes and the DVD copy, we have here in the last episode of this set some pretty bad ""flag waving"" at the top of the screen that should have been dealt with before release.
  But as far as the programs themselves are concerned, things are a lot brighter. ""The Undertakers"" is a look ahead to the very last Avengers episode in which rich men are allowed to ""die"" and stay underground until the heat dies down. Here they seem to be brought to a rest home of sorts until the 5-year suicide clause in their insurance lapses. ""Man With Two Shadows"" pre-echoes ""They Keep Killing Steed"" from 1968; while ""The Nutshell"" has Steed a prime suspect just as he was going to be in ""Who Was That Man I Saw You With?"" in 1969. (Very different plots, but pretty much the same basic concept.)
  There is much ado about selling and buying stocks in ""Death of a Batman"" (not a caped crusader, but a sort of valet to British officers) and about British politics (you must know what a backbench man is) in ""November Five."" ""The Gilded Cage"" is notable for the only role given in this series to a black actor until ""Have Guns, Will Haggle"" 4 years later.
  There is seldom the sparks-go-flying chemistry between Gale and Steed as there was going to be between Peel and Steed; and the horrible percussion that inevitably accompanies the fights do not make them any more exciting--but at least we know that doubles are not being used and it was shot ""live"" after all. Further, Johnny Dankworth's music is somewhat repetitious and unimaginative; the scores by Laurie Johnson for the Rigg series will be witty and appropriate.
  Still, it is not fair to judge this set by what was to come. So where I gave the '64 set four stars, I should but am not permitted to give this one 4 1/2. Therefore I will deduct a point for that flag waving and recommend this one as jolly good fun.",969840000,28,2535,4.5152838427947595

7924465,2,B00004W22H,"I realize I'm in the minority here by not offering an optimistic review, but after having watched most of the episodes shot in 1965-1967 with Diana Rigg, I just simply couldn't get enthused about these older episodes.  No, it isn't just because they are different and I don't like change...it is because they are inferior in every respect:

1.  Technically, they are grainy, have poor lighting, and were clearly shot with lower production values and budgets.  They are so bad that they have a feel almost like old B&W movies done in the 1930s.  If you've ever watched an old Laurel & Hardy film, you get about the same level of technical sophistication here.  It stuck me as at least 30 years behind state-of-the-art for the early 60s.  The 1965-67 versions shown on US TV (ABC network) were done on film at ABC's insistence and the quality definitely shows.  Watching this 1963 version I felt like I was watching something that was not 2 years older than 1965, but 30 years older.  Yes, they were that poor technically.

2.  Acting was just bad all the way around - worthy of daytime soaps with the amount of overacting I saw.

3.  Steed's character in particular has a number of nuances that made him quite different...he gets flustered, appears to be an almost bungling sort of side-kick to the strong character of Cathy Gale (played by Honor Blackman), and seems to be a little too eager to romance her.  It's a totally different, and far less appealing dynamic than what we later come to love in the Mrs. Peel years with Peel playing coy but not superior to the character of Steed. Here we find a well-dressed Steed as usual, but not quite as suave, debonair, and never-ruffled as we have come to expect from the Mrs. Peel years.  In short, I don't like the old Steed very well, and I really don't care for Cathy Gale.  I also didn't care for the fact that Gale smoked in the series.  Her voice even sounds smokey.  Yes, I know that Rigg is a voracious smoker, but her voice didn't belie that in the series and her character of Mrs. Peel didn't smoke.  She was just somehow more wholesome and appealing than the Cathy Gale persona given by Blackman.  My two cents worth.

4. The mystique isn't there.  I can't quite describe what it was about the 65-67 series in terms of set design and overall mood that gave such a wonderful quirkiness and mystere, but it is almost totally absent here.  These just felt like old, not-particularly-good soap operas with bad stunts, bad acting, and inferior production values.

5. The audio quality is poor, tying in with the overall poor production values noted in item #1 above.  The audio fades of music, sound effects, dialog, and the overall mix is just poor - often abrupt and unnatural.  Again, it feels like something made in the '30s - not the 1960s.

I got this DVD primarily to satisfy my curiosity as to what ""The Avengers"" was like before Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel made the series so special and gave it that wonderful chemistry with Steed.  In my opinion, I missed nothing by skipping these pre-1965 episodes.  I'm glad I only rented this rather than purchased it.  I couldn't even bring myself to watch the other 2 episodes on the DVD.  I just sent it back to Blockbuster after watching a single episode.

If, like me, you are curious about what the series was like in ""the early days"" I suggest you rent rather than buy.  If you like it - fine.  You can find the series here on Amazon, eBay, and elsewhere.  But if you are like me, simply nothing can compare to the 1965-1967 series which - in my mind - is the REAL Avengers that I've known and loved since my teenage years in the 1970s.  As for me, I plan to purchase Avengers DVDs, but will limit my spending to the 1965-1967 megaset offered by A&E.

Again, I realize that hard-core Avengers fans will probably be compelled to check out every episode.  However, consider my review here as an alternative viewpoint and instead of offering a glowing review I'm giving a caution that you rent before you buy.  You may just thank me for allowing you to save your money for the truly great 65-67 years instead.",1173657600,12,4109,4.53125
