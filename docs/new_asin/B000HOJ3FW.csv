(Germany, 1991) Director: Peter Kern. Cast: Winfried Glatzeder, Max Kellermann, Daniel Aminatey, Nicole Weber. Color. In German with English Subtitles. Running time: 89 minutes. Unrated.

Striding through Dusseldorf's central subway staition in tight jeans, cowboy boots and Elvis pompadour comes Axel Glitter, the brash 14-year-old ""angel from heaven"" in Peter Kern's STREET KID. Axel's halo is more than tarnished though. Even the local vice cops grudgingly acknowledge he's the trickiest little hustler in town. When Axel forcefully intrudes upon the life of an unhappily married man, he triggers a tragic chain reaction of unleashed passions and dark pursuits.",1155859200,,676,5.75
