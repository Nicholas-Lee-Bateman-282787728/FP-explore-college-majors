The workout makes me smile and it's a nice change from my regular gym workouts when I don't want to leave the house or don't have time to go to the gym.  Unless if you absolutely have two left feet, you will be able to follow along on this video.  This is a workout that can be modified for all fitness levels.",1490745600,,449,4.01123595505618

8759632,5,B01EVI4C3W,"I bought this from Collage Video before it was available on Amazon and it is such a fun workout!  Easy, somewhat dancy but no complicated steps, and great music.  It has the vibe of Zumba, but simpler, with music with a Latin-Caribbean flavour.  Filmed on location on a stunning beach.  For all who love walking workouts, you should try this one.  Any fitness level.",1463529600,2,366,4.65625
