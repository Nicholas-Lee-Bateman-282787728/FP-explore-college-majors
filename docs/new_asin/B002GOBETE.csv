8581696,1,B002GOBETE,This DVD is a waste of money.  The workouts are not very detailed and there is more footage of Nate Quarry talking about himself then actual conditioning information.  Conditioning instruction is about 10 minutes of stuff you learn in elementary gym class.  This DVD is clearly an attempt to get your money of off Mr. Quarry's  name.  Do not buy this video unless you're a die hard fan or your just an MMA junky who buys everything that says MMA on it.  Good luck with your training.,1264118400,,483,4.494252873563219
