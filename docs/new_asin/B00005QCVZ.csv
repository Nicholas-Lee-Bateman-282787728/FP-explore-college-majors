8219565,5,B00005QCVZ,"Crest of the Stars (Sekai no Monshou) is the first arc of a three arc literate character-driven drama based upon a set of novels (as opposed to manga).  Perhaps this deeper background is why the world and background detail presented in the anime has a deep richness to it.  Its taut clever battles contrast with the much lighter-hearted jockeying in the interpersonal relationship between her highness Lafiel and her charge Jinto.  There are aspects of political relationships, class relationships, and space empire relationships demonstrated.  Some of the smaller plot elements and relationship mysteries of the prior three DVD discs are concluded in this disc, but the larger scope epic items remain open for an obvious sequel.
For those who wait through the final end credits, they are rewarded with a short animated epilogue that shows what happens to Jinto and Lafiel three years later after they had parted ways in order to perform their duties.
After the first arc of Sekai no Monshou, there are two more series.  The next story arc is Sekai no Senki (Battle Flag of the Stars).
At this time, only Crest of the Stars has been translated into English, but other stories in this galaxy have been animated and are available in Japanese.  In addition to Sekai no Senki, an OVA titled ""Birth"" and the ""Crest of the Stars Movie"" have been created.  The movie version is a condensed version of the Crest of the Stars series and reuses the animation along with some new bits not present in the four discs of the first arc.
Of note is that the Abh are an engineered race of humanoids originally created as living machines.  They broke free of their human creators and destroyed that branch of humanity that created them.  They then proceded to reproduce rapidly and at the point where Crest of the Stars begins, they control over half of the known ""human"" space and are genetically superior to normal humans.  Intelligence, lifespan, reaction speed, psychic awareness of space, and other personal characteristics can be engineered and manipulated.  If you can imagine a highly numerous race like Khan (from Star Trek II) at war with the remaining humans, then that is part of the aspect of this storyline.  You get an idea very quickly from each fight which side is superior pound for pound.  Although the Abh are presented in a positive light (as the show is mostly presented from their viewpoint), I feel sorry for the humans each time they lose a major encounter.
Another nice part of the Crest of the Stars series (and this disc) is that the fights are done between fleets of ships.  This differs from many other anime that tend to avoid fleet actions and is nicely done.  Some of the English translations are in error in the series (and result in logic errors), but unless you have a eye for detail (and there is a lot of subtle detail) you may miss them as details sometimes come fast and furious and slow and langourous.
I think that this show deserves to have the original Japanese books translated and released in a trade edition.  Perhaps this could be bundled in a boxset with Sekai no Senki if it ever gets released in English.",1029801600,5,3137,4.738970588235294
8219566,5,B00005QCVZ,"This DVD contain the ending to the first season of this serie, which I thought is a pretty good.  The graphics is quite nice and detailed; the story has a good balance between seriousness and humor; the universe/background setting is also interesting and contains a lot of potential.  Keep in mind that this is the first season, which is just more or less an introduction to the real story, which starts on the 2nd season.  It's one of the few anime series and made me sit and watched through the whole thing in one sitting.  I have yet to watch all of the 2nd season and I'm looking forward to it.  There is also a 3rd season.",1010620800,,627,4.3247863247863245
