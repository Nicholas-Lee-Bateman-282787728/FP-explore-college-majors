1838584,1,B00008DDUK,"FUNimation has once again ruined another great anime series.  I bought the first DVD and was confused when the first episode wasn't like the Japanese version.  The DVD says uncut in both Japanese and English language but the first episode is only in English and censored.  Don't waste your money on this garbage, if all you want is the English Dubbed censored version, just wait until it comes on Cartoon Network.",1050537600,4,413,4.788732394366197
1838585,4,B00008DDUK,I am a huge Dragon Ball fan and I have been waiting for Dragon Ball GT for a long time.  This DVD is okay but the other DVD's of DBGT are a whole lot better.  In this DVD Goku gets turned into a boy by Pilaf by the black star dragonballs.  Goku as a boy makes the show very interesting and you'll enjoy DBGT just as much as DBZ!,1047686400,,328,3.7246376811594204

The protagonist, Goku, will have to fight against his enemies from the past if he's to save Earth. These villains are lead by Super Android 17, the most powerful creation of Drs. Gero and Myuu, former adverseries of Goku (see DBZ Season 4 for Gero and DBGT Season 1 for Myuu). Occupied with these formidable opponents, Goku does not realize an even more bloodthirsty evil is on the rise! Born from the Dragon Balls themselves, the Shadow Dragons will stop at nothing to destroy Goku and everything he holds dear!

1838733,3,B00008DDUK,"This is the weakest of the Dragonball series. It's kinda hard to find a new idea in a show that spanned over 300 episodes. The whole GT series felt like it was a last resort to continue a great anime. The thing that makes it necessary is that it is the conclusion to the most legendary anime ever. I think every Dragonball fan needs to see it, but don't expect anything grand. There are plenty of new enemies, but they aren't very cool. I also think that the Super Saiyan 4 transformation was a let down. That was one of the major happenings in GT. I personally enjoyed the Black Star Ball part of GT the most. It was very reminiscent of the early Dragonball and it was cool that Pan and Trunks were involved they way that they were. The The Android 17 story was pretty cool too. Like I said before if you're a Dragonball fan you should watch it, but don't expect too much.",1351641600,2,873,4.233532934131737

1838744,3,B00008DDUK,"The Dragon Ball GT Season Two box set includes five DVDs that contain the final thirty episodes of the series, as well as the Dragon Ball GT television special, A Hero's Legacy.  The first two discs contain seven episodes, the third and fourth discs contain six episodes, and the fifth disc contains four episodes and A Hero's Legacy.

This set begins with the Baby arc, which started near the end of the first box set.  This is followed by the joining of the Earth and the Other World and a battle with a resurrected No. 17.  The final arc of the series sees the Dragon Balls cracking and unleashing seven evil dragons with negative energy who are bent on destroying the world, due to overuse of the balls by Goku and his friends.  They must try to defeat the evil dragons and restore the Dragon Balls' positive energy.

A Hero's Legacy is set one hundred years after the end of Dragon Ball GT, and the only character who remains from the cast we know is Pan (who is now an old woman).  The story of this special follows her grandson, Goku Jr., and his journey to find the Dragon Ball at his ancestor Goku's home.  Pan falls ill, and Goku Jr. thinks that finding the Dragon Ball and making a wish on it will make her feel better.  Unfortunately, unlike his ancestor Goku, Goku Jr. doesn't show that he has strength and bravado.

As the Dragon Ball GT series progresses, it starts becoming harder to accept what's going on, and at times, it felt like some of the information presented in this series contradicts ideas that were set up all the back in the original Dragon Ball series.  When it comes to the A Hero's Legacy television special, I really didn't feel that it added much to the Dragon Ball universe and I found it to be a little on the boring side.

The main menu on the fifth DVD gives you two options: ""A Hero's Legacy"" and ""Episodes.""  If you choose ""A Hero's Legacy,"" it takes you straight to the TV special.  If you select ""Episodes,"" it takes you to the main menu you would see on the previous four discs, except it adds in a selection for the special features.  This set includes a textless opening and a textless version of the fourth closing song.  On these textless songs, the credit text is gone, but there are still subtitles that appear on the screen.  Also in the extras menu is a link for trailers.

One of the best features of the Dragon Ball GT box sets is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.

If you're a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise that wants to own all of the episodes on DVD, then you need to purchase a copy of this set to complete your collection.",1331596800,,2854,4.398095238095238
1838745,5,B00008DDUK,"Watching dragonball GT or grand tour, should only be watched if you love the dragonball saga, due to the fact the story line is not as good as dragonball & dragonball Z, espically that does get sad when things happen to characters can't reveal anymore overwise would spoil the plot line

Season 2 of GT takes you through the end of the Baby saga, the short but incredible (and my personal favorite) Super 17 saga, and the Shadow Dragons saga.

The movie, unfortunately, is greatly disappointing.  It seems to be an attempt to take us back to the innocent style of adventure we saw in Dragon Ball.  It is very dry, little action, little plot.  If I were to guess, I'd say this was a saga that wasn't allowed to get time on TV as it is rather rushed.

1838750,2,B00008DDUK,"Well this is the end, and I saw it coming. I have watched Dragonball from the begining to Dragonball Z to Dragonball GT. I have to say my favorite is the first Dragonball series, and I think thats true for a lot of fans, that might be why they tryed to in someway turn back time(make Goku a kid again) in DBGT. I think Dragonball GT season 2 is better than the first, but if you only get season two you'll miss some of the ""Baby saga"" that season one starts and season two finishes. I do agree with other reviewers about the lack of Z-fighters that fight in Dragonball GT, they leave everything up to Goku which is boring and fustrating to watch for a fan like myself. I do like the way season two starts, it almost makes you forget the stench of season one if you've seen both. To me the entire Dragonball GT series feels like it was made for kids to watch, and in some way was not truly part of the Dragonball story. In that way people who have not seen Dragonball or Dragonball Z can pick up Dragonball GT and enjoy it more than fans would. I guess Dragonball GT  season two almost redemed the GT series but ultimatey came up sort. I would say fans of Dragonball and Dragonball Z should not buy Dragonball GT season 1 or 2, they aren't worth the price, instead find a way to see them for free if you really want to see them. If your new to and interested in Dragonball I'd say get seasons one-thu-five of Dragonball and/or seasons one-thru-nine of Dragonball Z and skip Dragonball GT all together, trust me your not missing anything.",1304899200,,1536,4.278350515463917

1838800,5,B00008DDUK,"Throughout the years we have watched one of the most noble and pure hearted men grow from nave child to fierce warrior. Now we reach the final season of Dragon Ball GT. After handling evil in many shapes and forms, Goku has to defeat his deadliest of all opponents, himself!

After the defeat of Baby and the jump to Super Saiyan 4, all Goku and the gang want to do is relax. Sorry guys you're not out of the woods just yet! Goku has to first take down a few old foes just to find out that the Dragon Balls which has relied upon to bring peace and good to the world have turned against him. Now the balls have broken and each one has released its own evil Shadow Dragon. Each one is stronger than the next and Goku doesn't even know if Super Saiyan 4 can take them down.

While this show has been dumped on by many loyal fans I have to say the ending of this show was quite impressive. Considering that there was only one more season to work with the writers really tried to cram it all in and tie up all the lose ends. Many events and characters from Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z play a role in these final few episodes so you will be pretty surprised how it is all incorporated together. I love the fact that after all the adventures that the Z gang has had over the years it was Goku himself that almost cost every one certain doom. In the end of all things Goku makes a Frodo like exit from the world realizing that he is too dangerous to be a part of this world and this time he meant it for good. I liked how the show was just given a strait up ending in Goku's exit and in the end the whole story was really put together quite nicely. I feel that GT is a very important series to watch especially since Dragon Ball Z really didn't seem to be the perfect ending, but GT definitely got it right and the in the end I was satisfied.",1273017600,,1836,4.0550964187327825
1838801,4,B00008DDUK,Once we get away from Goku being a child the movie gets a lot better.  I would have loved to have seen more Vegeta fights though.  :-),1269993600,,134,3.925925925925926
1838802,4,B00008DDUK,"If you're familiar with the Dragonball franchise, than you know what to expect. Dragonball GT usually gets a bum rap by fans of the franchise, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. While not as action-packed as Dragonball Z, and not as funny and slapstick as Dragonball, I felt it found a decent balance between the two, with some good fight scenes and some comedic moments.

This season starts off finishing off the Baby Saga. I found the story of this saga a little weak, but overall it provides alot of action, so it's a strong finish.
Next we have the Super 17 Saga, which is a great view for those who have been following the show, since they throw in alot of nostalgia, bringing back old villians and characters. This is, however, a very short saga, which is a shame because it had potential for alot more story and twists.
The third and final saga here is the Black Star Dragon saga. It seems alot of people find this saga the best out of all of Dragonball GT, but I actually found this a little weak. The story doesn't come together like it should, and there was so much potential for alot more intense action, that they didn't really capitalize on. The cover of this season showcases SS4 Gogeta, but we really only get an episode or two of him.
And lastly, thrown in with this season, is the only Dragonball GT movie they made, ""A Heroes Legacy"". I've read some reviews about this movie being boring and pointless, but I completely disagree. It's a little heart-warming story, that is very remeniscent of early Dragonball. It makes it feel like the series goes full circle, which I thought was a great way to end it.

Overall, if you're a fan of the previous shows, invest in this one, and you won't be dissapointed. The story has its plotholes, but the animation looks good and the three language tracks gives you alot of option for how you listen to it, depending on which track you're a fan of (I personally prefer English with American music). Although they are remaking Dragonball Z with the new Dragonball Kai, it looks like we're not going to be recieving anything new, so take assurance knowing that this is most likely the last season in the story of dragonball you can own, and that's something worth having.",1268784000,3,2228,4.52605459057072
1838803,3,B00008DDUK,"As a big fan of both Dragonball and Dragonball Z I had always been warned off on Dragonball GT, because it was ""just no good"".

Well, I'll agree that it is not as good as the preceding series, but it is no where near as bad as others have said.  In fact, it's a pretty good wrap up to the story of Goku and co. There are fun, funny elements that hearken back to the original, more lighthearted, series, and grand fights that reminisce of Z.  If you are not a fan of the Dragonball franchise, this won't convince you.  But if you are there are some entertaining elements here that wrap up the long, long journey of Goku and the gang.

Winding that wavy line from the silliness of Dragonball to the seriousness of Z is the flaw in this series, though.  By trying to be both DB and DBZ in one package it fails to be either. My wife is a big fan of Dragonball, and enjoyed the parts where Goku is acting like a kid again, but when the stories change to the long fight scenes, she gets bored and drifts off. I'm more of a Z guy, and find the baby-Goku elements a bit over-the-top silly.  But, that said, they are still entertaining to watch.

If you are a fan of Dragonball, and have seen the same old battles again and again, GT offers some fresh and new fun adventures of the Z fighters.",1268006400,,1284,4.149193548387097
1838804,2,B00008DDUK,"When buying this, I knew that Dragonball GT had been criticized for many problems throughout the entire series, but being a dragonball fan I had to see how the story ended.  In the first season, the writers took a huge chance making Goku into a kid again in the first episode, which isn't what I want to see in a new story line.  As it was, at the end of DBZ, the show was getting way less serious and more kiddish with the Buu Saga.  When Goku became a kid everything changed, every fight was a joke and it seemed like a struggle to get the characters to be serious at all.  It was also made clear that every Z warrior in the series was a weakling except for Goku, who now had the handicap of being a child.  I have never seen Vegeta be defeated so easily and brutally until GT, and he is supposed to be the second strongest in the entire show.  (Side note: Trunks barely ever went super saiyan and every time he did it lasted a minute at most, ha ha it is so funny that as kids he could be super saiyan like it was nothing and now it was a complete struggle).

The way they ended the first season was mid-battle with baby, I have never heard of a series ending halfway through a fight.  After the Baby Saga finally ends, yet another random event happens and sparks a mini series but also creates the later story arc as well, The Shadow Dragons Saga.  While the basis of the story of the Dragons was an excellent idea, the way it was presented was atrocious, from an under developed storyline to predictable 'twists and turns' this storyline was all about fighting.  Every episode was about Goku and fighting!!!  Every other character except for the two lamest ones, Pan and Giru, were non existent until the last few episodes (In which they stood around and watched Goku and Vegeta get decimated nearly the whole time).  While Goku is the main character, I would have loved to see the saiyans all fight together as a team, but the writers stunted the series so much by having everyone rely on Goku every time.  Also Goku's new form seems to wear him out incredibly fast.  His body felt like 'jelly' and 'lead' more often than it felt ready to fight lol.

All these elemens added up to just not Dragonball quality.  The movie was the best part of this whole pack because it had many touching elements.  I just wish they had made it longer and had the series have more of a focus like that, than the constant jokes and fighting.",1265587200,6,2428,4.312775330396476

1838806,5,B00008DDUK,"After viewing season one, I can say I feel season two  will be a more enjoyable ride for DBZ fans.  We finish up the Baby saga with the stunning super saiyan four transformation, leading to one incredible battle if you ask me. Then comes the fate of the earth and Piccolo is actually in the story line for season two and plays a much appreciated role. I really enjoyed the Super 17 saga and the plot was great fun. Android 18's part in the action gives an emotionalside to the saga I felt fitted nicely. The only thing I didn't like about that saga was  that it felt much too short, leaving many unanswered questions:how did the two evil doctors get thier bodies back in hell to even create this clone of 17 in the first place?

The Shadow Dragon saga puts the whole concept of relying on the Dragonballs on its head. I felt the first few dragons could've been better looking and a bit more menacing, but the twin brothers and of course Syn Shenron save this problem. The final battle is epic and Vegeta at long last becomes a super saiyan four, and we even have the return of fusion. SS4 Gogeta is my favorite character automatically in this saga no doubt.

The only thing that bothered me is the story relies too much on Goku and no one else, other than my fav Vegeta, ever powers up at all. You would think after Goku reached SS 4 at least one of the other saiyans would reach at least SS3!

Hero's Legacy was a bit disappointing. it had a decent story but nowhere enough action.",1249689600,,1482,4.31294964028777

1838820,4,B00008DDUK,"Dragon Ball Z was the one greatest anime series ever created. With its action-packed universe and compelling storylines, Akira Toriyama's magnum opus had never failed to please. It was succeeded by Dragon Ball GT - a series created by Toei Animation, with only minor involvement from Toriyama. Unlike the first two series, GT has been met with a mixed reception.

After a long and intense battle, Goku and company finally manage to do away with the Tuffle threat brought on by the evil Baby. Everything seems to be back to normal finally, but of course, things don't stay that way long in the Dragon Ball Universe.

Two evil scientists meet up in hell and create a clone of Android 17, who fuses with the Android 17 on Earth - creating Super 17, a deadly new Android opponent threatening the safety of the world. As if things weren't already bad enough, old foes are escaping from Hell and roaming the Earth!

And then, things only get worse. Overuse of the Dragon Balls has resulted in them cracking, and releasing evil dragons our heroes must now do battle with. Seven dragons, each deadlier than the last. Will our heroes survie this, the ultimate decisive battle for Earth's safety?

The A Hero's Legacy movie, set 100 years after Dragon Ball GT, is included as well, following the exploits of Pan's grandson, Goku Jr.

The DVD set is divided amongst five discs, and contains the second half of Dragon Ball GT, plus the Hero's Legacy special. The picture has been subjected to digital noise reduction, and the set includes a booklet of character profiles and episode listings.

Obviously, if you're new to the Dragon Ball franchise, you'll want to start with the earlier series, but if you're already a fan and have seen everything prior, checking out GT may be worth your time. Just don't compare the series to Z. It's not even in the same league, largely due to Toriyama's lack of involvement. Still, the series is nowhere near as bad as everyone says.

One of my personal favorite features of the set is the Marathon feature. FUNimation includes a feature in these sets that allows you to view all of the episodes on each disc from start to end with no interruptions from intros/outros/recaps/etc. This is an extremely handy feature I wish more TV shows on DVD had.

Like the Z season sets, this one has been given some digital noise reduction, though the picture isn't massively improved over the older individual DVD releases, if at all. Fortunately, unlike the Z sets, GT has NOT been cropped!

Sound quality is similar to the earlier sets. English audio quality is fantastic, but the dub is still translated poorly and the voice cast is hit and miss. On the other hand, the Japanese audio quality is poor, showing its age, but it does feature a well-translated subtitle track from Steven J. Simmons that lets you experience the series as originally intended.

Additionally, like the earlier sets, you have the option of watching the English voice cast played against the original Japanese audio.

And unlike the Z sets, the GT ones actually have the next episode previews intact!

No special features are included here unless you count the trailers and the same textless opening/closing sequence all other sets like this have had. On the good side, the set does include a booklet similar to the earlier sets, with character profiles and an episode guide, making it handy to go right where you need to go on the DVDs.

It's another good season set for the Dragon Ball franchise, enough said. GT isn't my favorite series, but worth watching at least once. If you're a fan of the franchise and don't already have these episodes, you can get them all here for one low price. Issues with the series itself aside, this is a great set, and a good value, especially compared to the older DVD releases.

Highly recommended to any fan of Dragon Ball GT.",1242950400,18,3854,4.732835820895523

DBGT Season 2:
As you may have expected the beginning of this set wraps up the baby arc in a pretty predictable ""dragon ball"" way.  Through a series of punches, kicks, and kamehameha's baby is defeated.  The series wastes little time in introducing us to the next major story arc - the 'super seventeen' arc.  To be honest, there's not much I can say about this arc.  The bad guys hatch a plan to create the ultimate warrior (now I know I've heard that before!), he's stronger than anyone they've ever faced before, and they barely manage to defeat this warrior in the end.

After 17 has been scrapped we move on to the next, and last, story arc in GT - the shadow dragon arc.  This final arc is the best in my opinion because it's the most original.  Apparently all of the evil wishes that the eternal dragon had to grant created a build-up of negative energy within the balls that manifested itself into the Shadow Dragons.  One by one Goku and Pan seek out and do battle with this Dragons; each more powerful than the one before it.  I feel I must give special notice to Nova, one of the dragons, who is definitely my favorite because he's the only one of the bunch that has a distinct personality and can think for himself.  After six dragons have been defeated we're introduced to Syn, the one-star dragon.  After a very brief battle Syn absorbs the other dragons into his being and a Omega Shenron is born.  Again, through a series of punches, kicks, kamehameha's, and fushions Omega is finally defeated.

This set is definitely better than the first but it's still forgettable.  I like Dragon Ball and DBZ but this is just overkill in my opinion.  I don't really regret purchasing this series but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.

Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy

I didn't even know about this movie until I read of its existence on the back of this set.  To be honest I was pretty excited about it.  I watched the movie after I had finished all 64 episodes of the GT, although that is not in any way required.  There's very little that can be said about this 45 minute 'movie' other than it feels like two episodes of GT smashed together, and that is essentially what it is.  The movie follows Goku Jr., a descendant Goku, who is a carbon copy of Goku in appearance, but has a very different personality.  Goku Jr. is a bit on the cowardly side and is the victim of schoolyard bullies.  Goku Jr. lives with his grandmother Pan who falls ill. Goku then decides to go on a journey to find the Dragon Ball that Pan told her about with hope that it can restore her to health.

After watching the movie one word comes to mind: forgettable.  It isn't terrible; it isn't spectacular either.

Remember that this is just one reviewers opinion.  I encourage all Dragon Ball/Z fans to try this series out for themselves.  Thanks for reading.",1242950400,,2870,4.45489443378119

1838824,5,B00008DDUK,"Now before I get started, I have one thing to say, THIS IS NOT A COMPARISON TO DBZ IN ANYWAY!!! Now, onto the review. (Spoilers)

Taking Dragon Ball Gt as it's own series, season two rocked. The first season was blah, but I bought it because I hadn't seen all of them before, and I'm a completest. However, season two blew season one out of the water. Action went up, storyline, after the whole Baby foolishness, was pretty good and believable in the Dragon Ball world. Bringing all of the old villens from Dragon Ball and DBZ had a nice nostalgic quality to it, and although the Super 17 saga was short, it was very good. The Shadow dragon saga was interesting and the final fight against Omega Shenron was very cool.

Many people don't like the ending, but I personally do. It was touching in a way. The same with the movie. It may not have as much action, but compared to other dragonball movies, it had an outstanding plot. Emotional and believable. Another thing that was good was the death of Piccolo. Emotional in the Dragon Ball world is few and far between, but this had it.

Even if you didn't like the first season, pick this one up. It is so much better, especially since its only about 30 dollars.",1234483200,2,1210,4.417040358744394

The Dragon Ball GT name has been thrown in the mud ever since its release. Some fans really enjoy it and some just down right hated the entire concept. I for one found the series to be right in middle. It wasn't as great as DB or DBZ but it was still a series I could handle. You can tell from the very first episode that the magic is gone. The creator of the series really had little to do with the evolution of GT. That being said, it's probably a big factor as to why the series didn't do so well.
When the show initially aired in the US they skipped about 16 episodes which were later released and titled as ""The Lost Episodes"". That probably created some confusion among the masses.
If you've never seen Dragon Ball episode in your entire life, this is not the season to start with. If you start here you won't be lost. But considering what an affordable price it is, it's definitely worth picking up. The set includes the final remaining episodes and one OAV episode or a movie as the box set labels.
