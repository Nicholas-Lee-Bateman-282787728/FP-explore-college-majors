5553161,5,B00B2M7ENG,"love these cheesy 1950's movies. both movies have great transfers.while not to every taste, if you are of an age you will remember these movies from late night uhf tv. might have had only 6 channels back then, at least they put on a movie. no such thing as infomercials then.",1384387200,,275,4.411764705882353
5553162,4,B00B2M7ENG,"This DVD from VCI overall has pretty good audio/video.  Crawling Hand has a Medallion TV card over the first few seconds of the film.  Otherwise, I noticed the picture to be a little unstable in 1-2 spots.  VCI seems to have a problem with layer changes.  About 10 minutes into Slime People, the layer change was VERY noticeable.  Slime People is listed as being made in full screen.  The case says the features are widescreen.  I'm not sure, but it looks like fake widescreen(which is unacceptable)to me.  Other than that, there are 2 trailers and an excellent interview.
UPDATE:  I've had a lot of problems with the VCI layer changes.  When playing them on a newer player, the problem is corrected.",1380844800,2,700,4.710743801652892
5553163,5,B00B2M7ENG,We like this movie because we enjoy watching the older movies. The Creepy Creature 2 is a great quality DVD for the time that it was filmed,1377907200,,139,4.185185185185185

5553165,4,B00B2M7ENG,Great fan of the 1950 Sci Fi movies. When you get these bundles you almost always get one you never heard of. I was not disappointed. Turn out the lights and get some popcorn,1369699200,,174,4.147058823529412
5553166,5,B00B2M7ENG,"CREEPY CREATURE DOUBLE FEATURE. VOLUME 2
THE CRAWLING HAND/SLIME PEOPLE
Here we have two very good transfers of 2 very guilty pleasures. Again VCI goes all the way with stuff one would not think deserving of the lavish release that this certainly is.
The highlight for me was the conversation with Roger Corman and `50s top guru of the genre, Tom Weaver. Tom has been interviewing people since forever, it seems, and he knows exactly how and what to ask his interviewee in order to get all the facts down for the history books. His conversation here with Susan Hart is a perfect example of a ""Weaver-talk"" that comes off absolutely cozy and informative.
Thank you VCI! I only wish that ALL vintage Horror-Sci Fi-Fantasy films could have the coverage that these two admittedly minor but schlockingly fun films are given here. There are a handful of commentators who are worth the purchase of a DVD no matter what film is contained therein. Mr. Weaver is right at the top of these select few. Please, VCI, keep this guy busy!
Also see Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 1 with THE MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR and SERPENT ISLAND. The same excellence (and Mr. Weaver) is there also.",1367452800,9,1180,4.705314009661835
5553167,4,B00B2M7ENG,"These movies were made in 1963 but both have that fifties feel that I like.  Enjoyed Peter Breck and Alan Hale was good as
the sheriff.  ""The Bird's the Word"" made great background music.
The creatures in The Slime People were good for a laugh.  The love storylines were a little silly, but I enjoyed this movie.",1366416000,6,312,4.43859649122807
5553168,4,B00B2M7ENG,"I bought this because of ""The Slime People,"" which I haven't seen in years. TSP gave me a righteous case of the creeps when I was four years old, and I never forgot it. In the last few years, it's been a rare movie, save for a really cruddy upload on YouTube, which is an episode of MST3K.
If anything, ""The Crawling Hand"" is even sillier, and, to my taste, not as much fun as ""The Slime People"" because it's so talky. Good, but not great.
Good price and good print for both films. No nonsense entertainment.",1365811200,6,508,4.247422680412371
5553169,5,B00B2M7ENG,"Whatever your expectations of ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2,"" mine were probably lower. I had never before seen either of these shoestring-budget, 1960's-vintage, black-and-white films, and I had no idea how they measured up (or down) to the already low standards of the genre. Based on the garish lobby-card artwork on the front of the DVD case, though, I felt sure they would be, at best, forgettable schlockfests, or, at worst, a total waste of time and money.

Imagine my surprise, then, when I watched the two movies in this double feature (both are on a single DVD that appears to be pressed, not burned-to-order) in one sitting and enjoyed them both very much. Oh, there's no way anyone could call these ""good"" movies, not by any stretch of the imagination. But they're really not bad at all, given their limitations of budget, talent and special effects. These types of films tend to show up as blurry, washed-out, jerky, late-late-late-night offerings on obscure television channels, with 10 minutes of commercials for every four or five minutes of movie. The transfers of ""The Crawling Hand"" and ""The Slime People"" on this DVD are so crisp and sharp that the movies look better than they are. Kudos to VCI Entertainment for either finding excellent source material or for doing some good restoration. The plots aren't bad, either. Both movies are logically consistent based on their initial premises (the same can't be said for many modern films). The sound tracks are also fine. The dialogue is clear and precise, and the unobtrusive music doesn't drown out the actors' voices. Included on the DVD are two trailers and a 55-minute audio-only interview with actress Susan Hart by sci-fi film expert Tom Weaver that provides fascinating details and remembrances about making ""The Slime People."" How rare is it for a cheap DVD such as this one to have decent special features?

I really enjoy discovering old sci-fi movies that I've never seen before. Some of them, like ""Beyond the Time Barrier,"" are so bad that I watch them once and then donate them to the library. Others I hang onto because I'm sure I'll want to watch them again in the future. ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2"" is one of the latter, and it has a permanent place on my media shelf. My five-star review is not for the movies themselves, of course. Rather, it reflects the fact that you get these two pretty-good films in a quality DVD package for a mere pittance. Overall, it's definitely a five-star value.",1364860800,36,2501,4.85480093676815
5553170,1,B00B2M7ENG,Both The Slime People and The Crawling Hand are two of the worst movies ever made but VCI has done another terrific job finding good material. The image on both films is crisp from 35mm. But don't watch them alone. Bad movies are best enjoyed with friends.,1364515200,6,256,4.468085106382978

5553174,4,B00B2M7ENG,"Two of science fiction's most infamous films get the back-to-back treatment. Both are far funnier with some help from Joel & The Bots if you buy these films in their Mystery Science Theater 3000 versions. Still, they are sorta fun in a Ed Wood kind of way. Crawling Hand is my least favorite of the two, but Slime People isn't exactly high art. I love it more because it has genuine monsters (and man-in-suit monsters at that!). Yes! What more could sci-fi schlock fans want!? Both are silly fun and a good, innocently harmless way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon.

This is a very good deal from the folks at VCI. Two films on one disc and they look fairly decent to boot. Lots of PD (public domain) copies of these flicks floating around and they look quite awful in comparison. Sadly, we are almost certain to NEVER see these films get frame-by-frame restoration along the lines of the recent Ben-Hur and The African Queen Blu-rays, even though I personally think they deserve it. ALL films should be as clean, sharp and clear-sounding as possible. Just because. Besides, many films might not have the bad reps they have today if quality copies existed to judge them by, instead of the murky, washed out, pan&scan, fluttery-sounding junk copies that clog dollar DVD bins around the country. Oh well. For the price you cannot go wrong. These are fun films. 4 STARS.",1423440000,,1369,4.680497925311204
5553175,3,B00B2M7ENG,"I remember The Crawling Hand from years ago watching horror movies on a series hosted by Vincent Price. The two movies are pretty hokey and the girls in The Slime People sure seem to make friends fast, but together they make for a fun afternoon. One problem I had on two different sets I ordered was that The Slime People freezes at the same point early in the movie though there is no visible defect looking at the disk itself. Pretty frustrating.",1421452800,,448,4.475609756097561
5553176,3,B00B2M7ENG,"There is just something cheaply creepy about The Crawling Hand. I hadn't seen this since grade school and was expecting very little from it. Far from the case. A dismembered astronaut's arm gains a life of it's own and goes on a strangling spree. It's extreme cheapness works in it favor.
What didn't hold up as well is The Slime People. Cool monsters hampered by lackluster script directing and acting. I do have to give it credit for 1 good scene in a butcher shop.",1418083200,,467,4.5058823529411764

5553178,5,B00B2M7ENG,"Fun 50's & 60's SciFi flicks.  A fun trip back in time to an age of relative scientific & technological ignorance in SciFi movie making.  The pace of the movie was based upon then attention spans, the acting pretty standard for B films of that era and the ""special effects"" primitive to say the least.  But as a window on SciFi entertainment and social standards of the time a fine example.",1406592000,,390,4.464788732394366

If you like Teenagers from Outer Space and Plan 9 From Outer Space, and The Creeping Terror and The Horror of Party Beach, you will love this one.  It's right up there an example of a movie that's so bad that you can't stop watching it, and Have to laugh out loud every so often.  Some of the lines / dialog are hysterically funny, and of course delivered by amateur actors who were trying to be serious.  Brilliant.  When the lead character transforms into an alien, it is so pathetically funny.  Sorry but I have not watched The Slime People yet, but am looking forward to it.",1530662400,,622,4.3652173913043475
