6983840,5,B00SHEP9WA,Great anime I have read the manga and I am far ahead of the series but this story is great loved the way that they stay on point even with the branches they have and fanservice is awesome!!!!! And never to over the top although some parts leave a bad taste in your mouth still a great show,1422316800,,289,4.0
6983841,5,B00SHEP9WA,"The story of Kazeya, Satallizer and the rest finally get the anticipated US release.  After the events of the most recent NOVA clash, a new program is introduced - the E-Pandoras.  Girls who do not have the proper compatibility for normal Stigmata are given artifical ones in order to boost the numbers to defend the world.  However when a dangerous secret about the project is discovered, one girl must face her dark past in order to save those involved.  Can she overcome her greatest challenge by herself, or will the feelings of one be enough to save them all.

I watched this originally on HULU and have also waited for this to finally get a US release.  While you will get the usual fight scenes with a lot of blood, clothes ripping, and fan service, there is a darker story compared to the first season.  This is more for mature viewers as some of the scenes will be pretty brutal, but for fans it will be a must see.",1422144000,29,924,4.431952662721893

I've been awaiting patiently for the release of this! If you want some good fights and a pretty good story (although prepare for a fair if not way too much fan service) Pick up the second season!",1421971200,4,343,4.212121212121212

6983861,5,B00SHEP9WA,"You'll have to get Season One of Freezing to fully understand the second season. Very clever story overall between the two series. Lots of nudity (but in good taste) and very bloody fight sequences throughout. The girls are all pinups (some are incredibly beautiful and would rank among the best in any anime series ever done) and they do have excellent in-depth character studies of many of the primary characters. Amply sprinkled with excellent comedy sequences, but the overall story, while a bit bizarre at times, is very serious.  Jamie Marchi (one of my all-time favorite anime voice actors) is especially great as Rona Linchen in both series. They do leave a small opening for a third season, but the Funimation Studio is hard to predict as to whether they will keep a series going (same applies to their Sekeri series). Overall, this is a really great series with good graphics and fun to watch. One of my Top 10 favorites and hopefully they eventually decide to do a third season.",1461974400,3,989,4.783625730994152

6983868,4,B00SHEP9WA,"This is the second series of ""Freezing"". It follows on from the first series where the Pandora's now called upon to help create a group of E-Pandora. A Pandora is a woman who can combat extra-dimensional aliens (Nova) in combination with a male partner called a limiter. A Pandora is enhanced with stigmata from an alien. Not every woman can use the stigmata and the E-Pandora are a way to enable more women to fight the Nova.
In some ways this is a harem/ecchi anime. There is a lot of fan service and quite a bit of sado-masochism too. This is not necessarily for children.

The first Freezing was a mostly internally focused story about the school for Pandora. The second series is more outward looking with a broader political brush. This makes it more interesting than the first series and I think the better of the two. It's still quite dark and cynical but that adds a layer of complexity that enables the fan service but does not allow it to dominate. It makes more sense if you've watched the first season but could be watched on its own.",1456012800,,1047,4.510526315789473
6983869,3,B00SHEP9WA,Not what I was expecting,1455580800,,24,4.0

6983871,5,B00SHEP9WA,"After reading initial reviews, there were some negative comments here and there that made me hesitant to look into the sophomore season of the Freezing series. However, I can assure you that I have no regrets after finishing it. This is a very good anime series. I will explain why, but first will address issues that I was concerned with that others raised with their reviews. Let me at first address the fan service. Yes. Just as the first series contains nude breasts, this season also contains it. Others seem to have taken more offense to it, but I assure you that it is not fan service in your face all the time just for the sake of it being there like with shows such as Queen's Blade. This season contains nudity in the pool area because one of the main cast is just like that as part of the character and naturally these ladies will be naked in the shower. But it is certainly not over the top and on par with the 1st season. If anything, it is the added bonus OVA episodes that bring in the real raunchiness (bordering on straight up hentai) along with the hilarity of the jokes.

The second issue I read was the level of violence. The 2nd season barely scratches the level of violence of 1st, where we saw limbs being sliced/ripped off and throats cut in just the first episode. It does get bloody towards the end, but absolutely nowhere near a gore fest as others would have you believe. The 3rd issue raised was some of the very dark tones. I won't go into too much to prevent spoilers (despite others spoiling enough already), but the series does revisit Satellizer's very dark past that we learned of in the 1st season. I am glad they did because I was hoping things could be resolved with that regard. This series has dark issues it visits along with the nudity, so it is clearly meant for adults even if it isn't necessarily pretty or 100% enjoyable. And mature adults should be able to handle such topics accordingly.

All in all, this series does not continue what the 1st series implied the series could be: boy finds girl in educational environment and together battle fellow students or forces of evil. It's a trope that's been done many times. But Freezing Vibration does not continue down this all-too-familiar road and takes a refreshing approach. For example, more focus it placed upon the girls than the leading guy for once. It takes on the issues a normal person would question after the first season. With these girls being so rare, how do they replace them when they lose as many as they did at the end of the first seasom? This season addresses that in a great way of ethics versus ends justify the means to save humanity. While answering some questions, it raises others which I believe makes for good story-telling. We learn more about characters and see growth to where I actually grew to like some a lot more when they were barely memorable in the first season. I dare say I found this a bit more enjoyable than the first season. The animation was clean and beautiful, especially during fight scenes.

So ignore the negative comments. I definitely recommend giving this series a try: same amount of reasonable fan service, less graphic gore, gritty mature plot lines, great action, crisp animation, and very good storytelling. I think you'll like it.",1452384000,14,3286,4.585034013605442
6983872,5,B00SHEP9WA,"I think the first season of Freezing was better than the second but don't let that deter you from getting this box set. It's still a must have for Freezing fans.

Follow the girls as they move away from the Academy and towards their adventure in Alaska. A new type of Pandora appears there and all kinds of craziness unfolds as a new threat emerges.",1452211200,,349,4.369230769230769
6983873,5,B00SHEP9WA,"very nice to get season 2 so quick, its just what I wanted too with both dubs and subs, DVD and Blu ray formats, nice box and case art. good buy for the fan of the show",1452211200,,168,3.5675675675675675
6983874,1,B00SHEP9WA,"There is a category or feature of some anime shows called fan service where female breasts and underwear are prominently displayed in episodes.  A subcategory of that fan service is one where the women engage in combat in which their clothing is frequently shredded.  One example of that is the Queen's Blade series where women, mostly clad in skimpy bikini style outfits, fight with blade weapons.  Magically, little damage is done to flesh and mostly their clothing happens to get cut off.

The two seasons of this show are nothing like that.  In them, women are impaled with huge bladed weapons.  Limbs are cut off.  One girl burns holes through her opponents with some kind of laser weapons.  Large pools of blood form under injured characters.  Supposedly the women have super healing powers so most of them eventually recover from their wounds.

The girls are called Pandoras and are enrolled at a school that trains them to fight alien invaders from another dimension called Nova. In the first season, a second year girl engages in a fight with a third year who was trying to assault a new friend of hers.  Most of the rest of the season consists of various other third year girls ambushing the second year girl.  The third years appear to be mostly sadistic bullies and are actively trying to either kill or permanently disable the second year girl.  There are no consequences for these assaults.  Once in a while the mostly oblivious school officials step in and toss both parties into ""the brig"" without trying to figure out who started it.

In the second season we are introduced to an evil corporation that is trying to create more of the super powered girls through a series of unethical experiments.  Some of the test subjects die.  Eventually half of the girls rebel against the tests and try to stop them.  The other girls who are apparently ""just following orders"" engage in battle with them.

In a very disturbing set of scenes we see how the second year girl was sexually violated and emotionally tormented by her half brother for several years.  She was so damaged by the experiences that she can't stand to have anyone touch her.  The girl has to return home to try and enlist support against the evil corporation and the half brother attempts to start molesting her again. Just when you're hoping the evil brother meets some kind of violent demise, he apologizes and the matter appears to just be dropped.  ""Gee sis, sorry I raped and tormented you for several years"".  What the ****!!!

Another girl is strapped down to a chair, has electrodes attached to her body, and is tortured into unconsciousness.  In other scenes, a lesbian female grabs another girl by the breasts several times and attempts to lick her body.  Of course she is never punished or even scolded for what would be criminal behavior in real life.

These seasons cross way over the fan service line and could more properly be called ""torture porn"".",1451001600,3,2940,4.747534516765286

Ends on what I would call a high note, but leaves things open for a third season if they decided to animate one.

6983891,4,B00SHEP9WA,"Freezing returns; taking that term ""literally"" now, as the plot mainly takes place in Alaska. Satellizer, Kazuya, Rana, Chiffon, and Beth return; meeting other Pandoraii, getting involved with the mysterious ""E-Pandora Project,"" and (for Satellizer) dealing with a re-opened wound that is her half-brother.

Fans of the manga version may not like the switches and changed within the anime, but everyone else who'd been watching this anime should be glad: The upskirt panty shots, nudity, gore, and useful male leads return as if they've never left. What you get more of is the ""Sis-Fist"" and the psychological suffering.

Kudos once again to FUNimation for dubbing the show and the specials. (Why not Senran Kagura's specials, along with OniAi / ""It Doesn't Matter As Long As I Love My Brother;"" the world will never know.) However: Caitlin Glass is still not using her British / Cammy voice for Satella, Jamie Marchi is still using her ""run-on-sentences princess"" voice for Rana Linchen, and Cherami Leigh should stop being so afraid about using her real name for Chiffon Fairchild.

6983914,2,B00SHEP9WA,"This pretty much derails the series in my book. The story was holding itself together as it was just barely. In this installment to the series too many characters are introduced and the plot is lost. So far it seems the Nova Clash is a result of the manipulation of the very weapons used to fight the Nova, the pandora themselves, however the personal side of the story with Kazua Aoi and the Untouchable Queen is left in the lurch once again. The ending is a conclusion that ends the situation, but leaves an opening for yet another season, that seams to be heading in the direction of Queen's Blade, where the story will never quite get together, just a lot of nearly naked girls loosing their clothes at every opportunity. I have lost interest in this one. If you like Queen's Blade and Ikki Tousen You will probably like this one as well, but I did not.",1431907200,3,857,4.430379746835443

It happens to the star of the show with her clueless limiter walking around the same house while it is going on. Up until the last minute I thought he would break down the door and save her. I was so disgusted I almost threw it into the garbage right then. I still might because I'll never watch this again. I'm know there will be rape sometimes in an anime but you don't rape the main character in an ecchi harem. Who is writing this crap?Sure hope this is the last of the series 'cause I'll never buy another one.,1430092800,4,663,4.147286821705427
6983921,5,B00SHEP9WA,The artwork and story is good. This time it's about the girl's from east and west genetic. There some action. The story is more about east genetic side. In the it work out for the most part. I hope there be a 3rd season!,1429833600,3,220,4.0227272727272725

8698338,5,B00SHEP9WA,"- Synopsis: Many of the world's most powerful Pandoras have been ordered to gather at a secret base in Alaska. Although the Pandoras find out that their roles this time around is more drab. That is, they become part of a project to test the combat abilities of a new breed of warriors: the E-Pandora. These female fighters are a group of normal human volunteers that undergo tests to become just like the other skilled Pandoras that have been protecting humanity for quite some time. Although the thought of adding more to their fighting force is appealing, there's a horrifying rumor about inhumane experimentations being done on these E-Pandoras...

===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: An interesting concept that was addressed was the role reversal of males and females. The Pandoras (females), are the ones on the front lines, while Limiters (males) play the support role. This is something that many animes have not done. So it was unique and refreshing that they did this.

Another interesting concept is not to judge a book by its cover. While females tend to be associated with being delicate, among other things, this isn't quite the case in this anime, as they act as the vanguard while the males play the support role. Thus, veering from the cliche that males need to protect the females.

Like many animes, social interactions are heavily emphasized. Possibly for the simple and fundamental reason that almost anything a person does, requires communication between other human beings. It is highly difficult, if not impossible for humans to live a life of isolation. Even among introverts, humans need and thrive off of interacting with others. It's almost as essential as breathing.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 DVDs and 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays. This is rated TV-MA for violence, blood and gore, and strong sexual content. Uncensored and will show plenty of nudity. An approximate run-time of 5 hours. Also includes extra features such as 6 short OVAs. Pretty much identical to season one in terms of features.

- Conclusion: This is recommended only for mature viewers accustomed to the Ecchi genre. From brutal fight scenes, to sexy girls, this perverted, sadistic and butt-kicking anime is better suited for male viewers. There's plenty of character interactions, dialogue, flashy fight scenes, and of course, fan-service. This has less emphasis on the Pandoras when compared to the first season. As such, the plot may not be as engaging as the first one was.
