8519086,5,B007KFZU4Y,"There are many videos in the market that go in detail over one handed backhand and cover two handed backhand in lesser detail. I was looking for detailed information on two handed backhand, and this video gave me the details I was looking for. Its must have DVD for players aspiring to have strong two handed backhand as it is created by PRO who has great one himself.

Also other strokes and drills are pretty good. Since it is coming from a PRO player, the techniques shown are natural and easy to follow. I would recommend this DVD for everyone wanting to improve their game.",1335744000,,578,4.504761904761905
