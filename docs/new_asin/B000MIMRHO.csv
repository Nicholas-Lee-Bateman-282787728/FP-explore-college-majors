8588423,5,B000MIMRHO,"""A Grand Night For Singing"" is a PBS video that I didn't even know existed before I found it on Amazon.com.  Firstly, the biggest attraction for me was the fact that Tyne Daly was the host and performs several numbers.  For me, she is absolutely delightful and even gets to recreate two songs (the opening ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" and, even better, ""You're Just in Love"" from ""Call Me Madam"") that she had performed onstage.  One of the first shows I ever saw on Broadway was ""Gypsy"" w/Tyne and I've been a loyal fan ever since.  On this video, she looks and sounds fantastic and is delicious even introducing numbers sung by opera stars (who are all terrific, as well).  Anyway, the video is an absolute treat and I thank the person who put it up for sale.  Just wonderful!",1268870400,,780,4.535714285714286
