8739845,5,B017NBPBK2,"My dad is a WWII veteran and spent many months in England during the war so I thought he might enjoy this video.  I thought right.  We've watched it together several times.  Also, my pastor's father was shot down in one of the B-17s and was a prisoner of war for a year in Germany.  I got him a copy and found that he was most taken with the interviews of the women, as his mother was a war bride.  When his father was released from the POW camp, he married an English girl and brought her back with him.  Then I had to buy a THIRD copy for one of pastor's brothers, as the whole family wanted to watch it at their next reunion.  It's a very well-done video, I think.",1483660800,2,667,4.007575757575758
