8056093,4,B0008FXT4G,"As with most TV movies (and most TV Movies from this era) there is a certain kitsch to this movie. It's simply a reflection of its times. TV-Films made in the 1970's were cast from a mould that has long since been broken. But in this context, 'My Old Man' is actually a tastefully done, tactfully executed film that showcases the absolute beauty and appeal of Kristy McNichol. With the help of the one and only Warren Oates, the two play off one-another adequately enough to pull-off any directorial shortcomings or post production embellishments.

McNichol is breathtakingly attractive here. This film illustrates why so many of us teens were enthralled with her at the time and her acting here is in no way below par.

Warran Oates, as usual, puts in a great performance playing the part of the dad. Oates does well with these types of characters; consider his role in 'Dillinger' and 'Stripes' then add in a touch of softness. The contrast between Kristy and Warren seems to play well and this is more than likely due to the original character development as written by Ernest Hemingway.

I was surpised to find myself close to tears near the end of the movie; this took me completely off guard and speaks well for how effective a story it is, and the adequacy of McNichol and Oates in their respective roles.

In summary, Kristy McNichol is extremely well filmed here and looks every bit as beautiful as she ever did. She was something to be reckoned with at this age. No young star today has what Kristy had in this era; a mix of simple beauty, complex allure, personality, emotion, expression, inflection, eyes (what eyes!), lips, and definately hair (what hair!). This film illustrates it all and does so with total class and taste.

Did she have better performances? Yes. Was this her worst? No way.

Warren Oates was and is a great actor and he doesnt fail to live up to expectations here. He plays his part convincingly and with a razor-sharp gusto. Oates' and McNichols performances easily cast off any weaknesses the supporting cast may have had. The two of them save this film from itself and make it a thoroughly enjoyable TV Movie that will quite possibly bring a tear to your eyes while entertaining the entire family, young or old.

For light-melodramatic late 1970's TV-Movies, I highly recommend this one. For Kristy McNichol fans I VERY highly recommend this film. For Warren Oates fans I also recommend this movie.

Keep in mind that this is infact a 1979 made-for-TV Movie starring a popular young heart-throb and you will recognize it as a great, simple family film.",1327708800,3,2589,4.737777777777778
