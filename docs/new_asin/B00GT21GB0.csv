8627255,5,B00GT21GB0,"I've watched over a hundred Korean dramas, and this one is in my top 10.  The basic plot is about a con-man who targets a blind heiress, but doesn't count on falling in love with her. The beautiful Song Hye-kyo does a great job of playing the blind girl. While it's unavailable here, you can watch or download it from several free Asian websites.",1522800000,,346,4.40625
