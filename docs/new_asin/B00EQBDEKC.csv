5934389,5,B00EQBDEKC,"This is a wonderful production of the 4 seasons in the Sonoran Desert.  No words, just FANASTIC photography and music to carry you along.  Must have taken 1000s of hours to produce.  I bought several copies to share with friends. Even living in AZ for 40 years there was much I had never seen before. I was extremely impressed with this production and watch it often.",1403481600,12,367,4.53030303030303
5934390,5,B00EQBDEKC,"This is an incredible video.  If you're not sure if you like the desert, or if you're just getting to know the desert like we are, this video will make you fall in love with it.  If you already love the desert, then just sit back and enjoy it anyway.  It really is spectacular!",1389312000,11,277,4.092592592592593
5934391,5,B00EQBDEKC,"I live on acreage in the Sonoran Desert so every view on this DVD was in my sight in the past years.
However, viewing these known elements- be it animals, vegetation or vistas- through the artistic eye
of this video was a revelation. It is superbly made, flows seamlessly from scene to scene. Also the fact
that there is no human voice allows for the sounds of the desert to come through. Highly recommended
whether you live in AZ or not.",1389052800,21,438,4.419753086419753
5934392,5,B00EQBDEKC,"The visuals are stunning, Gary Stroutsos' music is mesmerizing in this unexpectedly captivating documentary totally without narrative.

5934407,5,B00EQBDEKC,"Having lived in Arizona for 50 years I can say this dvd does great justice to the nature, landscape, and terraine of our beautiful state. We are sometimes so busy trying to escape the summer heat that we don't get a chance to enjoy our surroundings.. The efforts to capture the animals and reptiles are amazing. The rain storm is breathtaking as it comes and goes so quickly that you forget it was here, so true to form. The flute music by Gary Stroutos compliments and completes the film to a ""T"". This segment on the Sonoran Desert shows so much life that we seldom get a chance to experience first hand.",1461628800,,606,4.419642857142857

5934409,5,B00EQBDEKC,"We had to buy this DVD after watching it on PBS. Beautiful filming of the seasons of the desert. The big surprise was how our kitty reacted to it! As soon as she heard the quails calling, she ran over to the TV and watched the rest of the program. She is riveted to it everytime I play it back. We decided to buy the DVD since the one we taped had the PBS fundraising cutting in every 10 min. or so. Once again...the kitty comes running when she hears the opening music now. Everything on this film is something she has seen out our front window at different times, deer, bunnies, javalina, road runners, lizards, snakes, bobcats, snow, lightning, coyotes...etc. This is perfect (and safe) for an indoor cat not to mention the enjoyment we get from watching it, and her watching it, too!",1460764800,10,787,4.43448275862069

8608486,5,B00EQBDEKC,"""Desert Dreams"" is one of those films that is great to have a copy of to watch whenever you need a lift or a little inspiration. Subtitled Celebrating Five Seasons in the Sonoran Desert, the photography in this video is absolutely stunning, as are the music and the desert sounds. There are five segments that are each about ten minutes long, filmed during each of the corresponding seasons: Dry Summer, Wet Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring. There is no narration at all (and no humans are seen in the video) and yet there is a rich educational value is in being able to closely observe the interaction of wildlife, time-lapse photography of flowers and dramatic cloud formations, and being able to see how insects handle life in the desert.

It is so easy to get lost in the beauty of the images in the film and Gary Stroutsos music enhances that affect to perfection. Stroutsos is known primarily for his Native American flute playing on recordings, in film soundtracks, and in concert performances. The sound track for ""Desert Dreams"" also has some drums and keyboard here and there, but is mostly Stroutsos and his  haunting flutes. Natural sounds from from the desert are also part of the soundtrack, giving insight into what the various creatures and events sound like as well as what they look like.

""Desert Dreams"" is a wonderful DVD for both educational and entertainment purposes, suitable for any age group. I give it my highest recommendation.",1507161600,,1457,4.843373493975903
