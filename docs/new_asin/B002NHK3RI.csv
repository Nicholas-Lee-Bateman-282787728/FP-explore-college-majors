8375057,3,B002NHK3RI,"This play is rare on video; as near as I can tell, this production is the only one available.  The Shakespeare completist must obtain it while he can, despite the price -- hence, ""essential.""  The flaws to which I allude are that the audio track, at least as reproduced on this DVD, is ""boomy"" and base-heavy, and this, combined with some of the actors' inclination to fling their lines out at high speed (as youngsters do, perhaps to demonstrate their mastery), mitigates against a good impression, especially for beginners.  But it's perfectly workable with headphones, which is how I finished it, solo, after the first act had been frustratingly impenetrable to a novice.  And I don't mean to overplay a sour impression.  If you know the play a bit, and if you are used to the cadence, this is plenty of fun.  Some of the performances are really excellent; Launce -- and of course his silent dog, Crab -- have maybe never been better.",1375228800,2,937,4.682926829268292
8375058,4,B002NHK3RI,"The BBC productions can be hit and miss. Some are wonderful (Hamlet, Henry IV I) but others feel like ""tv adaptations."" This one definitely is not great, but considering that it is an adaptation of a play that has so few filmed productions, it is worth it. The actress playing Julia is a standout. The production does not shy away from the play's controversial ending, but it does neglect to show Silvia's reaction which is quite an interesting choice. And, any play with standout characters like Speed, Launce, and, of course, his dog is worth a look.",1369180800,,552,4.701030927835052
