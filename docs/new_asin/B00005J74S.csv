However, the version of Independent Women is at the Brits 2001 live.  That was included as the bonus feature on the UK version of 'The Platinums On The Wall'.
All that said all DC fans will still want this.",991353600,11,334,4.107692307692307
7938518,4,B00005J74S,"The music and video aren't the problem here (i.e., if you got this far to read reviews you probably are a fan of the trio, or are contemplating buying this DVD for one).  Rather I was a bit disappointed that this DVD-single lacked 5.1 audio, and that the price is a little steep for what is basically the SURVIVOR videoclip, a live version of INDEPENDENT WOMEN...and that's it.  It's unfortunate that they didn't include perhaps a ""Making Of SURVIVOR"" videoclip to give the buyer a bit more value for their money.",989971200,18,513,4.626373626373627
