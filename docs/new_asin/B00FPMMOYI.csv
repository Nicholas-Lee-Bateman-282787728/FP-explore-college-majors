8617637,3,B00FPMMOYI,"The portrayal of the emperor was almost comical. He must have been mad from the beginning. What was sadly missing was the female element in the emperor's life. So little was mentioned that one gets the impression that he had no interest in women, or in producing heirs for continuing the dynasty. But they were there. We know because hundreds of his concubines were locked alive in his tomb and he had sons to succeed him. I have read that he had sex with hundreds of young virgins in his effort to achieve immortality. I find it strange that this was not mentioned. Anyway, I found it interesting, and at the same time disappointing.",1531094400,,634,4.5701754385964914

8617639,5,B00FPMMOYI,I agree with the other positive reviews this was well presented.  What I liked best was at the end the scientific evidence showing the precision of where mercury deposits in the tomb corresponded to a map of ancient Qin with the most concentrated deposits mapping seas and rivers.  Watch to visually understand for yourself.  I also like the info. about why the tomb was built.  I did not realize this same emporer was responsible for starting the Great Wall.  I started to watch this critically worried about if it was overspeculative.  It was well done. This docudrama is a helpful companion to fictionalized accounts of his life such as 2017 The King's Woman. It filled historical gaps that were implied in the drama and that drama helped me to understand the psychology of the emporer's motivations during his life as presented and made the history accessible.,1520726400,,864,4.883561643835616
