7947607,4,B00005NOOB,"I have the entire Ranma 1/2 6th Season and I think this Vol 5 may be the one best in the series possibly tied with the Vol 3 and Vol 7.
The reason I give this a 4 star is because the episode that carries this DVD is episode 125 an Xmas without Ranma which is fantastic and a real feel good episode with all the characters we love getting together for Xmas.  Ep 126 A Cold Day in Furikan was below average. Ep. 127 Akane Goes to the Hospital is nice because it reveals a deepening in feelings between Ranma and Akane but is otherwise rather uneventful.
This is probably not the volume to buy if you like a lot of fighting. But if you enjoy the relationship part of the Ranma series you would probably enjoy this.
If you are new to Ranma I would recommend getting one of the earlier boxed sets, if you are a diehard Ranma fan you probably want this in your collection.",1063065600,,866,4.124260355029586
7947608,5,B00005NOOB,"Random Rhapsody:Wacky Winter Wonderland has got to be the best of all the Ranma 1/2 DVD's to date.  All three episodes on this DVD are fantastic.  Especially ""A Christmas Without Ranma!?"" & ""Akane Goes To The Hospital"".  In ""A Christmas Without Ranma!?""  Akane & Ranma go shopping.  When they decide to head back home to decorate the house Mousse shows up and picks a fight with Ranma.  Ranma then promises Akane he'll head home as soon as he takes care of Mousse.  Time passes and Ranma is nowhere to be found.  In the meantime Shampoo, Ukyo, and Kodachi are fighting and arguing about who gets to spend Christmas Eve with Ranma.  That's all I'm saying:)  If your a Ranma 1/2 fan this DVD is a must buy.  If your not, but considering it.  This DVD is the one to start with.  This DVD proves that Christmas time is a lot more than just giving or recieving presents ;)",1023580800,,867,4.4113924050632916
7947609,5,B00005NOOB,"I have been a die-hard anime fan for over twenty years now and Ranma 1/2 is one of my all-time favourite series.
These episodes are some of the best. The stories are great, the animation is great(well, okay, not great. But not as bad as the episodes at the beginning of season four -- YICK!), and the voice-acting remains superb in both the original japanese and english dubbed versions.
These holiday themed episodes are wonderful. You get to see Ranma display some true feelings for Akane and vice-versa.
The DVD presentation is great with a super clear picture and great sound.
My one gripe? There are absolutely NO EXTRAS included on this disc! You get two versions of the show and that's it. Sure there's chapter stops and everything but that's standard on all DVD's. Come on! Give the hardcore Ranma 1/2 fans a little something extra! Original japanese promo art or T.V. commercials would be nice. Or just a gallery of past video cover art. Or at least some previews(which are still available on the VHS versions).
Aside from that one gripe this DVD is pure gold. It contains two of my favourite episodes and another episode that ain't bad either. If you're a Ranma fan, this is a must-have!",1007424000,3,1197,4.677725118483412
