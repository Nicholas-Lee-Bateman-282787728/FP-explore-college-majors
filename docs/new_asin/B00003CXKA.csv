1318357,4,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man, first of all, has one of the coolest hollywood summer film premises ever. Just what would you do if you knew nobody could see you, and  would never get caught? This is what the film delves into, but this time,  Sebastian Cole (Kevin Bacon) is a little naughty. After him and his crew of  scientests discover a drug, therfore making them invisible. With this, he  realizes anything he does, he will not be punished for. At first, his deeds  are simple peeping tom acts. Sneaking into womens bedroom. But then, rage  starts to surface, and he targets those that he worked with, stalking them.  This is a great visual feast. The speacial effects are top notch, and the  fact that most the time, you cannot see Cole, it adds to the suspense  amazingly. Your not going to this film for any award winning storytelling,  or amazing acting. This movie accomplishes what it sets out to do, and  thats scare the audience, and give them a visual display. And it does this  wonderfully, a great movie.",964742400,10,1001,4.593220338983051

1318668,5,B00003CXKA,"I watched Total Recall and I really enjoyed  it but before I watched Total Recall I have seen Hollow Man which I really enjoyed watching  as well. Made in 2000 movie ''Hollow Man'' starring Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon,& Josh Brolin is about a scientist who renders himself invisible and goes psychotic . The movie  was adapted from the Invisible Man a story by H.G. Wells and had great characters especially the main three, a good storyline, and spectacular special &  visual effects on making Kevin Bacon invisible. I didn't watch hollow man when it came out in 2000 because I was two years old so I didn't remember so much until I watched a couple years later. Besides, this is considered one of my favorite Kevin Bacon Movies along with ''Wild Things'', ''Flatliners'', ''A Few Good Men'', ''Mystic River'', and of  course Footloose. Other than that I have to give Hollow Man 3.5/4 . ""Its amazing what you could do when you don't have  to look at  yourself in the mirror anymore! """,1451001600,,984,4.6531791907514455

1318715,5,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man is essentially a retelling of HG Wells' The Invisible Man with minor tweaks/twists. I had seen the film before when I was roughly 8 years old. All I could ever recall from the film was the first half, I remember why...

PLOT:  In a large facility scientists are experimenting with animals on a serum which turns living beings invisible. Leader of the project-Dr. Caine eventually decides to use himself as a human test subject. At first he does minor trouble-playing pranks, etc. Over time Caine grows sinister in nature...

Paul Verhoeven directed Hollow Man and he has since regretted making the film. The film has a star studded cast and a terrific score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Effects man Tom (Monster Squad) Woodruff Jr. worked on the film and played Isabel the gorilla. Caine's attack on his neighbor was originally longer and had him rape her. Test audiences had still identified with Caine until that point and felt the attack was too early of transformation for the character. Other scenes that were cut include Sarah talking to Matt & Linda. Sarah confronting Caine about killing the dog. Caine stalking Linda. All of which can be found on the DVD as deleted scenes.

REVIEW:  I'm not the biggest fan of Vehoeven, I like Robocop and Total Recall but not much else. He brings flair and breathes life into Hollow Man, however even he couldn't save some of its flaws. Caine's descent into madness happens fairly quickly and while most of the characters are likeable, they're pretty bland. Everybody involved gives a great performance but its bogged down due to weak characterization. I find myself enjoying the first half more because after Caine kills the dog, it becomes a run of the mill horror flick. In some ways I'd even go so far as to call it a slasher film. The characters meet gory-grizzly deaths by an unseen assailant. The false endings are annoying as well, Caine should've died after electrocution-it served as nice ending rather than the, suddenly Caine has survived the explosion and is then defeated-falling back into the explosion which should've already killed him. There are some minor plot holes, but nothing too big. The effects are stellar and the score is amazing. The setting is claustrophobic and eerie. At times the film is suspenseful, dreary, fun, and melancholy. Overall it's a decent flick but it doesn't hold a torch to 1933's The Invisible Man. It's not as bad as some claim it to be, just a tad forgettable.

Hollow Man was released to DVD several times by Sony. There's the director's cut, special edition, and Suberbit deluxe 2 disc edition. A blu ray of the director's cut was released by Columbia in 2000.

Final Thoughts: Hollow Man is a decent sci fi/horror/thriller but it's not a film that will be revisited often. For what it is it's good but could've a lot better. It's fairly cheap to buy which is something that works in its favor. It's not a bad way to spend an hour and 42 minutes.",1438560000,3,3407,4.916376306620209

1318721,3,B00003CXKA,"Worth watching I think because of the presence of Elizabeth Shue. An improbable and tiresome sci-fi film. Like the red shirts in Star Trek, a lot of the secondary characters have to die - predictable. The characters are scientists who have developed an ""invisible man"" technology. Of course, like Dr. Jeckyll, the science corrupts the main inventor. That the project could have gone forward so far without a lot of people, knowing about it, is a bit much to believe.",1427068800,2,466,4.8375
1318722,2,B00003CXKA,"Dreadful ""reworking"" of the standard Herbert George Wells invisibility idea finds Kevin Bacon as a research scientist who is tampering with an experimental invisibility formula in the hopes of finding away to make his light (and mind) bending project a success. Unfortunately, that is where the logic of the film begins and ends. Depressing effort from ""Spetters"" director Paul Verhoeven that actually makes one ponder the meaning behind its very existence, as nothing fresh or exciting is really added to this standard, worn out idea of the ""invisible man as ghostly presence"" concept. Some gorgeous female specimens on display cannot save this sadly exploitative film, with Bacon's character serving as a sadistic excuse to move around raping women and terrorizing his fellow nerds (other than the Bacon character's alleged sadism--which I did not buy from him as an actor, by the way--there is zero depth to this standard ""bad guy"" personality on screen). There is seriously nothing in this film that could not have been shot for a television movie instead, and Verhoeven is right in saying that any other filmmaker could have handled this content (I think, if you'll pardon me, better to boot). Some flamboyant special effects work, while far too heavy on the CGI, is somewhat memorable, but it is all to no avail since this story is hackneyed, routine, and surprisingly uninterested in its own ideas (which is the most heinous part, if you ask me). At the very least, the filmmakers could have tried to make it scary in some way, but as such it as a fairly D.O.A. affair. Hollywood poured an absurdly misspent amount of money into this fairly illiterate extravaganza; even if the director had the print taken from him by distributors and suffered the loss of his initial vision, I suspect that the real fault here lies in Gary Scott Thompson's ""original"" screen story (which is a pretty hollow-minded conception in and of itself). And the film's greatest transgression is that it simply isn't much fun, and not nearly as stunning as all that money should have made it. But, as Randy Newman might say, you've got to have a hollow woman when you're a hollow man! And in that respect, the lovely Elizabeth Shue might be the best thing about this picture, but even that is only half of a compliment. D-",1426636800,,2303,4.877551020408164
1318723,3,B00003CXKA,"The fabulous FX was nominated for an Oscar (losing to Gladiator).  It's the only thing this movie has going for it.  Otherwise, it's simply a slasher flick stuck in clich hell (trap a group of people in one place then pick them off one by one).  Poor H.G. Wells, past suffering the indignity of yet another substandard version of his classic tale.  Supposedly, even Verhoeven wasn't thrilled with the final results of this movie, stating that he wished he hadn't made it in the first place (unless coercion was involved, it was his choice to foist an inferior product on an unsuspecting audience).  Even so, it was a big hit (in a business where money is everything).

The main problem with this film was putting all the weight on one character, Sebastian Caine (as misplayed by Kevin Bacon).  When the main character is a mad scientist, who's obviously already nuts to begin with, where can you go from there?  Bacon makes the transition with no perceptible difference.  (Amusingly enough, Bacon was chosen over Guy Pearce and Edward Norton for this role because he has the ""ability to be both charming and diabolical.""  Neither of which are in evidence in this movie.)  As for the rest of the designer docs who make up the cast, none of them struck me as being even remotely scientific.  When they finally started the invisibility process on Bacon, I found that I was never happier to see an actor disappear.  Pity his character proved so resilient in the end.

This movie proved to be both exciting and frustrating.",1426550400,2,1518,4.722433460076045

1318790,3,B00003CXKA,"Okay, saw this movie for the first time last night. Got three hours of sleep because for some indefinable reason it woke me up/kept me up. So let me see if I got this straight:

Kevin Bacon's character is roasted alive by Elisabeth Shue's improvised flame thrower. Then he is electrocuted. Then the lab (which he is in), completely blows up. Then, with no skin left on his body at all, he climbs up a broken elevator shaft entirely engulfed in flames, about five stories of climbing mind you, all to catch Elizabeth Shue by the ankle and ask her for ""one last kiss.""

If you ask me, this guy deserves to be forgiven for showing his undying love. (Even if he is a psychopathic killer). Shue should have dropped her pretty boy new guy and went back to no skin/only bones man. Yet is this the ending to the movie we see? Naaaaah. Got to have that trite romantic ending with pretty boy.

Sure the guy raped, tortured and murdered his way back to her. She can't forgive the little things? How cold-hearted can you get? I expect better of the thespian level cinema that is a Kevin Bacon flick. Is it just me?

Best part of the film by far is the scene where Kim Dickens falls asleep. Worth buying the movie for just that. The rest, eh, what can I say? Reviewers say this is the better of the two Hollow man films? I shudder to think of what the second one is like. But now I must watch it. The compulsion is almost...almost like what you'd do if you didn't have to look yourself in the mirror every morning, ay?",1411516800,3,1505,4.288732394366197
1318791,4,B00003CXKA,"I remember really looking forward to ""Hollow Man"" when it came out in 2000 because the idea of becoming invisible is intriguing. I was entertained when I saw it, but also somewhat disappointed; an odd mix. Viewing it again last night I was wondering if I'd have the same impression and the answer is yes.

The story revolves around a group of young-ish scientists (who are too edgy and ""hip"" to be believable) working on a serum for the government that can make people invisible. Their secret lab is underground in an industrial sector of Washington DC. They've been experimenting on animals, including a gorilla, with some success, but the group leader, Sebastian (Kevin Bacon), wants to take the next step by prematurely experimenting on himself. Havok ensues.

Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin play key teammembers, Linda and Matthew. Linda is also Sebastian's ex-girlfriend who's secretly seeing Matthew, which stirs Sebastian's jealousy when he finds out. (But why should he care since he's no longer seeing her?)

I don't know if it's the fault of the director or writer, but they go a little overboard in trying to make the protagonists edgy (overkill cussing, etc.) to the point that the characters somewhat lose the viewer's sympathy. Thankfully, it's just a little overboard because most of the rest of the researchers are likable beyond Sebastian. And Linda and Matthew weren't really doing anything wrong by seeing each other since, again, Linda was no longer Sebastian's babe.

Even though one member of the team morphs into the villain, he's not without interesting qualities in the first half of the movie. In fact, I can't help but respect his ""we're the originators of this project so we make the rules"" attitude and his consequent refusal to submit to the manipulative authorities over him.

While there are some outside sequences (shot in DC and L.A.) the bulk of the film is confined to the underground lab, shot on sets in Culver City. The good thing is that these sets are excellent, as far as underground labs go, but it makes for a one-dimensional viewing.

Memorable and amusing parts abound, however, like the excellent F/X of the partially appearing/disappearing gorilla and, later, Sebastian. Also, the amusing way invisible-Sebastian has some fun with a couple of kids in another car. There's also a laugh-out-loud joke about Superman, Wonder Woman and the ""Invisible Man,"" crude though it may be. I also like the double meaning of the title: Sebastian isn't just a hollow man literally, but also due to his ignoble character -- arrogance, lust, etc.

While ""Hollow Man"" is a sci-fi/thriller it takes on horror elements and clich&eacute;s in the final act as the researchers are wiped out one by one. Who will survive? So, while ""Hollow Man"" is worth watching, it's far from great, mainly because it fails to take advantage of the promising material and essentially becomes a one-dimensional boogeyman movie.

1318792,5,B00003CXKA,A miss understood film that should be given more credit.,1409011200,,56,4.7
1318793,1,B00003CXKA,"When I heard that Paul Verhoeven directed this film, i was instantly excited.

Hollow Man is a modernized version of The Invisible Man, and in pretty much that aspect alone, it succeeds. Now, the special effects where incredible, but special effects didn't make a movie good (Yes, The Matrix was a well written film that just happened to have special effects).

This is what one could call a huge disappointment; The movie presented all the necessary elements to be a great social commentary about Image and Egotistical behavior, but what did it do? It lapsed into a badly paced ""Horror"" movie with an extremely blunt ending. Of the Science fiction films Paul Verhoeven has made, this is easily the worst one.

If the movie had been subtle and used good dialogue based scenes to explore the crisis that Caine was facing it would have been at that 100 times better, but this movie chose to jump right over emotion and it failed.

I will never watch this movie again, and for The Bottom Line, disappointingly i'd have to say
10%- Hollow Man presents what in the beginning looks and feels like a modern take on The Invisible Man, but inevitably, it becomes a slasher type horror film, falls from it's great premise, and quickly dies off.",1400630400,,1234,4.699074074074074

1318884,1,B00003CXKA,"Hollow man is the kind of film that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
In this horror-thriller feature, we explore the degenerate mind a brilliant scientist, Sebastian (Kevin Bacon), who is part of a team researching a breakthrough in turning living tissue invisible.  After a lot of risky trial and error, he opts to test the procedure on himself with a measure of success.
The film loses all semblence of sanity from there as Sebastian quickly spirals downward into the Uncanny Valley, challenging all boundaries of human decency as he exploits the lack of detectability afforded to him, becoming a monster in every sense of the word.
Sebastian rapes, steals and murders his way through the rest of the movie, which falls flat on its face in a puddle of crude sex jokes and weak performances.

Despite its deep-rooted awfulness, it does have a few merits in terms of special effects, and Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian well enough that the actor now makes me a little uncomfortable when I see him in other films.

1318886,1,B00003CXKA,"There are movies that make you feel dirty and miserable, because there is simply nothing there to like -- not characters, plot or even a good feeling.

One good example: ""Hollow Man,"" the loosest possible adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel ""The Invisible Man""... except that instead of one stupid scientist, we have a whole cast of them. Gratuitous animal-abuse, rape, some great special effects and a despicable cast of annoying characters... well, it's easy to see why Paul Verhoeven hasn't made an American movie since, even if it was very profitable.

A bunch of scientists are working on an invisibility formula for the military, led by the arrogant Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon). When they successfully return a gorilla to visibility (almost killing it in the process), Sebastian decides that it's time for human trials -- and secretly has the team inject HIM with the serum. All seems to be going well... until the reversion therapy fails. Sebastian is stuck until his team finds a cure.

And unfortunately, the serum seems to be making him cruel, violent and psychotic -- he uses his invisibility to spy on his increasingly paranoid team, including his ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and her new boyfriend. And to stop the team from warning the military about the danger he poses, he's willing to trap and kill them one by one...

""The Hollow Man"" is the loosest possible interpretation of ""The Invisible Man"" -- the only thing that connects them is an invisibility serum that makes you crazy and evil. But while there was only ONE scientist doing stupid things in H.G. Wells' story, this movie has SEVERAL scientists doing stupid things. A lot of stupid things.

I will say this: the special effects are spectacular, particularly the process of both Sebastian and the gorilla turning invisible and visible again. Almost fifteen years later, they still hold up beautifully -- the dissolves of skin, muscles, veins and bones are almost grotesque in their realism.

Here's what's wrong: EVERYTHING ELSE. The plot is entirely dependent on people doing idiotic things -- the entire premise is that these scientists stupidly decided to secretly start human testing because... well, because Sebastian wants too. No better reason. It's riddled with a thousand tiny holes (a gorilla hits a guy and he doesn't even get bruised!), and the dialogue drips with sleaze. There are a few amusing moments (Sebastian freaking out some kids with his ""hollow"" face), but the rest of the movie taints them.

It's also painfully obvious from the beginning that Sebastian is going to immediately go evil and develop a god complex. But since Verhoeven is not known for his subtlety, this is expressed by him beating animals to death and making comments so obviously psychopathic that I'm surprised he didn't go ""Mwahahahahaha!"" at the end of every sentence.

And there's an ugly streak of misogyny that runs through the movie like a stream of fetid excrement -- and the brutal rape scene is only the most obvious example, especially since we never see that poor woman again. She is literally there just to be leered at and raped. If it were just Sebastian, that would be okay, but the hostile yet voyeuristic attitude seems to permeate the entire film.

I think it's the movie's intention to make us hate Sebastian, which is a massive mistake -- Kevin Bacon is easily a good enough actor to bring dimension to the arrogant, callous Sebastian, and evoke some kind of sympathy for him. We should feel somewhat sorry for a man going mad. Except Verhoeven makes you hate him from the beginning, and makes it clear that there is no good in this man, so he ends up basically being a less witty, less visible Freddy Krueger.

The sad thing is that the primary concept of ""Hollow Man"" is a good one, but the ugly, sleazy way it's presented just squanders it. Even Kevin Bacon can't save this turkey.",1391990400,5,3887,4.884673748103187

His demeanour in this film is generally a bit creepy, and it's great to see him evolve into a cold-blooded killer throughout the film. Great special effects for its day and I loved how they focused a lot on the science of invisibility.

I'm not a fan of Josh Brolin, I found his character annoying, but his presence was necessary for the final battle between Bacon and Shue. Elizabeth Shue's character was semi-Ripley in nature; strong, independent, intelligent and has a killer instinct. She's almost the ultimate character (though, she was highly feminised at times). The special effects were great, particularly the parts where Bacon is burnt to a crisp (no pun intended) and we see his quasi-invisible scabbed flesh. Awesome!

Still, Verhoeven is damned good at dishing up the cheap thrills, and there is something weirdly disturbing about this movie that has stayed with me for several days after first seeing it. I give a lot of credit for that to Kevin Bacon, who manages to cut through the cliches of his vain character. And it does ring pathetically true that, for a lot of guys, the biggest thrill of being invisible would be copping a feel. Unfortunately, Verhoeven quickly ups the ante to include rape and murder and at that point the movie plays out as by-the-numbers horror flick.

1318989,2,B00003CXKA,"They say everything's better with Bacon; however, in the case of ""Hollow Man"" that saying rings a bit, well, hollow. Kevin Bacon stars as an obsessed scientist on the verge of an earth-shattering breakthrough: it seems as though he has discovered the key to invisibility. After successfully turning himself invisible, he harasses and haunts his co-workers in their secluded underground lab. The crew, fed up with his shenanigans, seeks to find a cure but that only brings the monster out in him, turning things from bad to worse.

Director Paul Verhoeven's time-waster is heavy on special effects but light on characters and originality. Bacon chews the scenery as the arrogant scientist on the fritz, while co-stars Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue seem like they belong in a better film. Verhoeven does the best he can with an anemic script, but eventually the special effects take over and the film becomes a bloated b-flick with a budget. There are at least a few genuine thrills to be found, and the film carries such a mean-streak and perverted air about it that it at least never gets dull. Unfortunately, like many of the director's latter-day films, ""Hollow Man"" takes things a bit too far and the end result is a sloppy, botched experiment, much like Bacon's science project.

While there are certainly worse sci-fi flicks to be found, ""Hollow Man"" is an example of great potential failing to live up to expectations. In this film, you have a solid cast and a director who knows how to entertain within the science-fiction and action realms. There are redeeming qualities to be found, but they are few and far between. For lack of a better term, ""Hollow Man"" is pretty hollow.",1346544000,,1684,4.86411149825784
1318990,1,B00003CXKA,"So Linda Foster (Elisabeth Shue, ""The Saint"") is a scientist who has been working on a serum that can turn people invisible, Linda and her team try it out on a gorilla which doesn't exactly work so well, but that doesn't stop another scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon, ""Stir of Echoes"") deciding he's the best man to test it out on humans. Well more like he tests it on himself and despite almost dying in the process it works and initially things seem fine, he's kept under observation but gets cabin fever being trapped in the building so he breaks out at one point and attacks a woman in her apartment (played by the gorgeous Rhona Mitra, ""Doomsday"").

After beginning to feel Caine may be going a little nuts given that he can no longer see himself and that this invisible power is going to his head, the team tries to develop a cure for this condition. Caine doesn't like hearing about this and turns quite homicidal, targeting everyone on the team, in fairly goofy and cheesy fashion. Sadly the special effects are the only decent part of this movie as director Paul Verhoeven, (""Starship Troopers"") pretty much has nothing positive going on in this movie.

Really bad acting here, even Bacon seems lost with having to play the villain and be very one note with his role, Shue is very typical as the female lead and Josh Brolin (""No Country For Old Men"") is also in this as a fellow scientist. The story is so simple, the dialogue is even worse, the death/suspense scenes are not in any way good and the ending sequence is so laughable its just gut bustingly funny. * out of 4 stars.",1344038400,2,1594,4.53125
1318991,4,B00003CXKA,"Kind of a modern take on the invisible man, the science fiction thriller Hollow Man (2000) follows a team of scientists developing a cutting edge technology, which eventually leads down a dark and violent road.  Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers, Robocop, Total Recall) capably directs what is basically a mad scientist creating a monster tale.  Hollow Man combines a B-movie storyline with absolutely first class production values, and breathtaking special effects, that are still impressive today.  The movie takes some time to explore the situation, before it goes berserk and becomes an action thriller overdriven with special effects.

Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) has developed a serum that has successfully rendered animal subjects invisible.  With the help of his team headed by doctors Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), Caine makes a breakthrough, successfully restoring an invisible gorilla.

Working on a government sanctioned project, in a top secret underground lab near Washington D.C., Caine hides his success from a Senate committee overseeing the project.  Determined to test the serum on a human subject, Caine injects himself with the serum, and after nearly dying in the process, does become invisible.  Unfortunately the serum that is supposed to make Sebastian visible again fails, and again nearly kills him.

The frustration of not being able to return to normal, seems to make Caine mentally unstable, and eventually violent.  He is also upset that his ex-lover Linda, is now romantically involved with Matt.  To try and get Caine back under control, the couple reports what has been happening to their superior in the government, but Caine murders him before he can take action.  Caine returns to the laboratory, and after locking it down, begins to attack and kill the members of his team.  The movie finishes as an extended and spectacular battle to the death.

The outstanding special effects featured in the film are worthy of the Oscar nomination they received.  Very impressive and vibrant looking are the reconstruction scenes, where blood vessels appear, followed by the skeletal frame, muscles and ligaments, and then skin and hair.  Although in the early days of CGI, the effects still hold up very well, as the invisible Caine becomes visible when swimming in water, exposed to smoke or steam, and even when set on fire.  The film also features some impressive kill scenes and gore.

Hollow Man explores the dark side of man's nature, as free from conventional restraints, Caine freely crosses moral boundaries.  Featuring some provocative nudity and sexual violence, some may find that the occasionally sleazy path taken to be unrealistic, but people often do not behave like saints.  The magnitude of Caine's moral transgressions may be extreme, but the possibility is certainly real.

Paul Verhoeven does an excellent job throughout the film, but particularly shines in the action sequences, which are often excessive, visually stunning, and arranged to peak and valley, crashing like waves hitting the shore.  With a central premise of invisibility, realism is off the table fairly early, but the story grabs and holds your attention anyway, as it progresses from a scientific exploration to complete mayhem.  The love triangle is completely unoriginal and a bit weak, but still serves as a motivating factor in what happens.  Kevin Bacon gives a brave performance, as even when he is ""invisible"", he is often present in the scene wearing some kind of colored bodysuit.  Except for Sebastian Caine, the characters aren't particularly deep, but are still pretty engaging.  The cast also includes Joey Slotnick, Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Rhona Mitra, and William Devane, who all do a solid job.

The DVD includes a number of featurettes, and an informative commentary track featuring Verhoeven, Bacon, and writer Andrew Marlowe, which covers technical aspects, the cast, and fun facts about the production.  Bacon describes how being invisible, isolated him from rest of the cast in some regard.  The film's lively musical score is by the masterful Jerry Goldsmith.  Not meant to be taken seriously, Hollow Man may not be well regarded by some, but it is provocative and solidly entertaining effort, with rocking special effects, and just enough science to get by.",1330128000,2,4356,5.271014492753623
1319091,3,B00003CXKA,"What I liked about this movie was the special effects. Instead of things we've now seen a hundred times, like car chases, buildings collapsing, etc, we are treated to seeing a gorilla's body appear from the inside out, and then the human body disappear from the outside in. It was pretty fascinating. After that, the movie was still pretty good. It was the end (and by this I mean the final third, which is a good portion of the movie) that was NOT good. Stop reading here if you have not yet seen the movie.

The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that Sebastian, the doctor who becomes invisible, suddenly seems to become immortal, and that makes no sense. Being invisible has caused him to become sick with power and lose control, and the other scientists are forced to fight back. The problem is the guy just won't die! At one point, the one girl dumps a bag of blood on him, yet minutes later he is completely invisible again, so the others can't find him. Now just when did he have time for an extensive shower to get all that blood out of his hair? After that, they beat him with a crowbar. He comes after them. They spray him with fire. He comes after them. They electrocute him. He comes after them. But at least this has made him half visible! The worst part is that after the lab explodes and the elevator collapses on him, he makes his way through the trap door in the elevator and comes after them yet again. No, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the worst part is that Hollow Man 2 ended the same way: the guy got up and came after them after falling out a 2-story window, without even a limp. And didn't he get half-visible after being electrocuted somehow? I forget for sure. Yep, I watched the sequel. I don't know exactly why.

One can only hope that with this movie, much like Jurassic Park, scientists learn that it is a bad idea to mess with experiments like this.",1329955200,2,1874,4.36676217765043

1319093,3,B00003CXKA,"This is a modern take on the Invisible Man.  The special effects are amazing and Kevin Bacon steals every scene as an egotistical scientist who uses his own serum to turn himself invisible against the protests of all of his team.  Of course, he goes a bit mental and turns against his own team because he likes the ""freedom"" of being invisible and doing whatever he pleases.  The problem is the story is too predictable and shallow.  And, like any big budget Hollywood thriller, it never seems to end because the Invisible Man keeps coming back over and over despite some very serious injuries inflicted on him that would have killed a normal person.  Pretty far-fetched but I was expecting that.  Overall, its not a bad film if you have time to kill but don't expect to see a particularly good film.",1318636800,4,800,4.598591549295775

1319095,2,B00003CXKA,"A while ago I caught ""Hollow Man"" on cable. I entered at about the point Sebastian Crane (Kevin Bacon), now invisible, infiltrated the young female intern's apartment and started to unsettle her with his pranks. Based on the portion of the movie I saw, ""Hollow Man"" is an implausible, but a fairly and mechanically entertaining horror schlock fest with undeniably impeccable special effects. It isn't necessary for me to provide yet another plot synopsis.  The other 200+ posts have already amply done that. However, I wish to discuss the fundamental reason why ""Hollow Man"" in my opinion is not a particularly effective or memorable sci-fi/horror movie: Its premise, the ""power"" of invisibility, in and of itself, is really quite weak.

The movie's obvious inspiration, H.G. Wells's classic novel ""The Invisible Man"" itself meticulously spells out the numerous disadvantages of invisibility. Even the invisible, megalomanicial protagonist himself considers himself a ""helpless absurdity"". The disadvantages include: 1) unless you also make your clothes invisible, which the novel's protagonist actually could but didn't have time to do, your naked invisible body is more vulnerable to the elements and to disease, 2) dust, soot, and rain will reveal your outline, 3) eaten meals will outline your invisible stomach until the food is digested. 4) animals such as dogs can still hear or smell your presence. In other words, an invisible person still possesses the flaws of an ordinary human being.

Furthermore, ironically, an invisible person would be more conspicuous to the public than an ordinary person. That's because, as the novel points out, invisibility grants you the power to obtain things, but not enjoy them once you get them. So, for example, you can rob a bank without being seen, but you can't get away with the money without being noticed.

The above-mentioned disadvantages existed even in the novel's 19th century setting. In modern times, invisibility is even more of a disadvantage. Motion detectors and heat-imaging sensors can detect even an invisible man's presence. Therefore, an invisible villain may get a few limited jollies at the outset, but will still be easily captured by sensible heroes.

To its credit, ""Hollow Man"" recognizes some of invisibility's disadvantages. However, it artificially shifts the edge to Sebastian in order to even have a movie. Yes, the heroes have heat-sensing goggles, but the lab automatically becomes uniformly warm to hide Sebastian's temperature. Out in the real world, the naked Sebastian would be easily detected and apprehended, so the movie's climactic action must remain in the claustrophobic lab. And, as others have mentioned, invisibility does not confer invulnerability (even if adrenalin surges can partially account for Sebastian's newfound resistance to pain). Finally of course, to keep the plot moving, Sebastian's pursuers, his former lab associates, must do inexplicably idiotic things, like not making sure Sebastian stays out after being clubbed, electrocuted, burned, etc.

To conclude, invisibility has its (limited) uses and can supplement other abilities, but in its own right is not really remarkable. Why do you think Marvel Comics's Stan Lee fortified the Fantastic Four's Invisible Woman's invisibility powers with force-field projection?",1304467200,3,3326,5.461089494163424

Of course, that still leaves it with a large potential audience (given when this is being written, I should say, gave it a large potential audience).

1319100,5,B00003CXKA,"I'm not sure why everyone is dissecting this movie. Its not Shakespeare people! This movie is nothing more than an entertaining thriller. Sebastian (Kevin Bacon) plays a genius scientist who uses himself as a guinea pig when his science team successfully figure out how to bring back animals who are made invisible. Sebastian and his team in a meeting with the Pentagon fail to tell them that they have figured out how to bring animals back from invisbility. In other words, Sebastian want to keep that knowledge and power to himself despite the government funding his research. Sebastian then volunteers to become invisible as the first human guinea pig. Sebastian is successfully made invisible after nearly dying on the table, but once his viatals are stablized, the team is unable to bring him back to normal. Days and weeks pass then all hell breaks lose. The movie clearly explains why Sebastian goes crazy but everyone posting here is questioning it. After Sebastian's team fail to bring him back to normal and he is locked in the facility, he starts to lose his mind, conscience, morals, everthing. Get it? Hollow Man. Anyway it's the affects of the invisibility serum that causes psychosis which I thought is clearly explained in the film. After Sebastian sneaks away from the facility they warn Sebastian. In his anger he kills a dog in the facility and that's when Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin decide to tell the Pentagon and the rest of the team finds out the Pentagon doesn't know about Sebastian becoming invisible. At this point Sebastian is completely psychotic and starts killing everyone who knows (the science team) to stay invisible. I watch this movie every time I catch it on HBO and I'm buying the DVD when I get a chance. I enjoy this movie and of course watching Josh Brolin.

1319160,3,B00003CXKA,"I should lay my cards on the table and admit that I thoroughly dislike Paul Verhoeven's films (well certainly ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Total Recall"" - who else could ruin a Heinlein and a PKD?) I think his approach to making films is condescending, meretricious, and cynical; and I don't relish being patronised.

""Hollow Man"" displays all the standard symptoms of advanced Verhoeven Syndrome: shallow plot, no character development, gratuitous violence, and a contempt for the laws of science that almost amounts to an organised campaign to subvert SF as a genre. Witness the dramatic idea (stolen directly from H.G. Wells, of course) of making animals and human beings completely invisible, without the slightest shred of scientific explanation except for some mumbo-jumbo about quantum shifts. Making organisms vanish is done by injecting them with a lurid orange liquid injected from an immense hypodermic that looks like a Fisher-Price toy (but only after it's been ""irradiated""). Making the creatures visible again calls for the identical process - but this time with a bright blue liquid! (I'm not making this up, honest, although I might have got the colours transposed).

Bacon, who acts as brilliantly as usual, is represented as not too tightly wrapped at the best of times, and when his cunning plan to become world-famous by being the first human to vanish and reappear goes pear-shaped, he sulks and then goes psycho. Cue an outbreak of picturesque violence loaded with themes stolen from here, there, and everywhere - music reminiscent of ""Predator"", hidden menaces like those in ""Aliens"", and of course a huge explosion that hurls a fireball up a lift shaft after Shue and Brolin like those in every other ""thriller"" for years. Naturally the fire almost catches them, washing over Shue's legs without crisping them or even, indeed, giving her mild sunburn. (The same explosion hurls the lift itself clean past them faster than a BMW on the M40, but there seems to be no shock wave at all). The fireball recedes down the shaft but remains on active duty, chuntering quietly to itself, ready to consume Bacon's body as he hurtles back down (whoops, sorry, spoiler, but some things really can't be spoiled any more than they already are). Brolin is run clean through the guts by some sharp metal object, then semi-frozen, and seems to be at death's door - after which he runs, fights, climbs about a hundred yards of vertical steel ladder, falls a few yards onto a roof, fights some more, and is last seen walking away quite normally, arm-in-arm with Shue.

Yet, even as you wonder what second-hand trick or stunt will come next, you have to admire the acting and even the psychological insight of it all. How many of us have known bosses like the nut-case Bacon depicts? Fortunately, your boss probably can't make himself invisible in order to stalk you - yet, anyway. Imagine how much fun that would be!",1241568000,6,2918,4.951020408163266
1319161,1,B00003CXKA,"In real life good and evil are not completely black or white but colored in shades of grey. Kevin Bacon's character was a ""good guy"" but his scientific ego made him slightly grey along with the others on his staff. After their invisibility experiment worked on him, he went insane and was definitely in the black (evil) zone.

Still, it was hard not to feel sorry for him given there were a couple of scientists more evil than he was. They were not only on scientific ego trips but decided to treat him as a lab rat.

This movie was nauseating because the less evil scientists all die and the most evil scientists live.  At least Bacon could claim insanity as a reason for his evilness.",1239926400,,686,4.428571428571429

Not just voyeurism, but the relationship between audience and events that take place in the film.  It degrading into a simple horror film is actually exactly what the audience wants to see: sex and gore.  Not only do we get to see it, but it could be argued that our desires for it are actually translating into the film.  There is no invisible man and it is us who all are performing these depraved acts.  This is much more disturbing to me than seeing some masked killer watch and then violently murder a victim.

1319167,4,B00003CXKA,"""Hollow Man"" is a masterpiece of science fiction horror.  A modern remake of ""The Invisible Man,"" it is a slasher film that is primarily set in the claustrophobic environs of a high tech underground laboratory.  It has the age old theme that was present in such horror classics as ""Frankenstein"":  A mad scientist believes he is God.

  Egotistical play boy researcher Dr. Sabastain Caine (Kevin Bacon of ""Friday the 13th"") has invented a drug capable of turning animals invisible.  (The potential medical and military applications are mind boggling.)  Only problem is that it is nearly impossible to reverse the procedure.  The longer an animal remains invisible, the more psychotic it becomes.

  Determined to make history, Caine injects himself with the drug.  He experiences a personality transformation similar to that in ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.""  Unable to become visible again, his evil personality takes over.  He traps his colleagues inside the laboratory and murders them in gruesome fashion.  He was a victim in ""Friday the 13th""; now he is the serial killer.

  Gorgeous Elizabeth Shue (""Link"") oozes sex appeal (doesn't she always?) as fellow researcher, Linda McKay.  While battling the invisible maniac, she reminded me of Sigourney Weaver's outstanding performance in ""Alien.""

  ""Hollow Man's is a must see for fans of modern science fiction horror such as ""Resident Evil,"" ""The Fly,"" ""Alien,"" and ""Mimic.""  Fans of slasher fare will also enjoy this one because some of the death scenes are gruesome.  The ending is quite explosive.",1224201600,3,1552,5.211382113821138

GIVE ME A BREAK. I DID NOT WATCH THIS TO SEE AN OUTLINE OF KEVIN BACON'S PRIVATE PARTS.,1209600000,,253,4.521739130434782
1319291,2,B00003CXKA,"One thing that can't be praised enough about `Hollow Man' is the amazing, and I mean A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, special effects that are so believable and so impressive you'd swear that it was real.  Sadly, that aside, `Hollow Man' is just that; completely hollow.  There is no substance here.  `Hollow Man' just serves as a sorry excuse for nudity and violence.  I know that complaint sounds strange since this is a horror movie and what else do you expect from a film in this genre other than violence and nudity.  Well, to be completely honest, there is nothing wrong with either of the aforementioned as long as they are strung together by a feasible and interesting plot.  `Hollow Man' just has no point.  It moves from slightly entertaining sci-fi thriller into eerily cold slasher film and then plummets into cheesy and ridiculous action film; all the while nothing of really any interest is taking place on the screen.

I think the biggest problem with `Hollow Man' is that none of the characters are interesting.  Kevin Bacon is as boring a villain as they come.  His `god complex' is stereotypical and bland.  Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin generate no real heat and while both are beautiful human specimens the film drains them of any acting talent they possess.  In the end we don't really care who lives or dies and that detracts from the entertainment value of the film.

The story follows Sebastian Caine, a scientist who is heading a secret government team experimenting with invisibility.  They have so far successfully turned a handful of animals invisible but have had grave difficulty bringing them back to visibility.  Once Caine breaks the code and finds a way to bring the animals back he decides he wants to be the first human to undergo the procedure.  Once invisible he realizes that the same serum that brought the animals back will not work on humans and he winds up invisible for far too long (apparently after being `out' for too long it starts to mess with your mind) and he winds up doing some very questionable things.  Now it's up to his co-workers to stop him before he goes too far.

The sad thing is that with a premise like that of `Hollow Man' the director, actors, screen writers; whoever made these decisions had the opportunity to really take this story places.  Instead they resort to the same ol' same.  Sebastian Caine spys on his hot neighbor; attacks her and then starts to kill off his co-workers.  It's predictable and sadly very been-there-done-that.  The acting is also very bland.  Bacon is horrible, truly stereotypical and one-note.

The best acting comes from Rhona Mitra...hmmmmmm.

In the end I will say that when I first saw this film I loved it.  I was fifteen I think and it had nudity and violence and I didn't care if it was senseless or ridiculous; it was just what I wanted to see.  Now that I'm older I can't see any real value to this movie.  They took masterful, state of the art graphics and pasted them together with a rudimentary plot that took no imagination to construct and that single-handedly drives this film into the ground.  Watch the first twenty minutes of the film to experience the amazing special effects (when they bring the gorilla back to visibility it's a visual god-send) and then turn it off before your mind turns to mush.",1207872000,4,3300,4.710296684118673
1319292,4,B00003CXKA,"What would you do if you had the ability to turn yourself invisible? Would you use it to mess with friends, co-workers, and maybe even neighbors? Or would you try to get into places that you are not normally allowed to go? Or are there some of you out there that would embrace your darker desires and abuse the ability by committing wrongs against others whether they know it or not? I know for me, I would most likely use the ability to mess with others (not in a harmful way, just play tricks on them), and the temptation would be there to go into certain places where I'm not allowed to go, but I know for a fact that I wouldn't abuse the gift by hurting others directly or indirectly. In director Paul Verhoven's (""Robocop"" and ""Basic Instinct"") 2000 hit science fiction release of ""Hollow Man"" starring Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, and Josh Brolin these questions are pondered to varying degrees, and the results tend to be more sinister in nature.

""Hollow Man"" is the story of a team of scientists, led by Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), who have been commissioned by the U.S. government to create an invisibility serum. After successfully testing the serum to turn living beings invisible on animals and finally achieving the breakthrough of turning them back to visible, Caine manipulates his team into jumping head-first into human testing, namely on himself. Once the serum has turned Sebastian invisible, the remainder of his team discovers that the serum that returned the animal subjects back into visible beings doesn't work on humans. This surprising discovery leaves Caine invisible for a much longer period of time than was initially planned, and he eventually begins to believe that his co-workers, led by Sebastian's former flame (Elisabeth Shue) and her new boyfriend (Josh Brolin), are in fact trying to kill him. This realization, combined with the rationale that you can do whatever you want when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore, causes Sebastian Caine to turn on his former colleagues and begin hunting them one by one. Now, this team of ill-fated scientists find themselves in the fight of their lives against an unseen foe that is becoming increasingly dangerous and unstable.

""Hollow Man"" is a slick, fast-paced sci-fi/horror movie that is very enjoyable, but loses some of its luster if you stop to think about the story too much. The story for the film is decent, though nothing spectacular by any means. I liked the way the film spent some time trying to explain the science behind the invisibility serum, and its effects on animals and their mental capacities, which made Sebastian's eventual psychosis later in the film more plausible. However, I would have preferred his descent into madness not been so sudden after he discovered that the serum to return him to being visible again may kill him. It was his rationale of believing that his co-workers were trying to kill him via the serum that made this portion of the movie seem a bit weak. There had been no indication of that intention on their behalf prior, but suddenly the serum fails and voila, they must be trying to kill me. Come on writers, a little more depth could have been given to his reasoning here, not just glossed over to start the horror aspect of the film. Even though Sebastian's reasoning was weak, the time spent showing the escalation of his pranks on fellow co-workers turning into full-blown criminal activity was very well-paced and made his eventual murderous rampage much more believable based on what his character has been shown to be capable of over the course of the film.

With a script that was decent, but could have been better, ""Hollow Man"" could easily have been swept aside as being just another average sci-fi/horror hybrid that would quickly be forgotten. Fortunately for the film's financial backers the cast was comprised of top-notch stars that elevated the material above the average existence it would have had. Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, and Josh Brolin comprise the main cast for the film, and each actor/actress delivered strong performances, even handling the sci-fi techno-jargon rather convincingly. Thanks to the rather talented cast, the inadequacies of the script were somewhat forgotten, or at least not nearly as obvious to the point that they were too distracting to the viewer during the film.

Finally, the most spectacular component of the film would have to be the outstanding visual effects work. Even for an eight year old film, the effects that are employed to create invisible characters are still as visually impressive today as they were the day it was released. I wonder though, if ""Hollow Man"" had been created today with the even more inflated budgets that most sci-fi movies enjoy, would the effects look any better? I tend to think that they would most likely look pretty much the same as they already do, which shows just how great the effects really look. The only place that could even remotely be improved is the sequence when Kevin Bacon turns invisible, some of the sequence looked a little fake, but then again, I haven't seen anyone with their skin invisible before to see what they look like underneath, so for all I know that may have been an accurate representation. Even if it wasn't completely accurate or realistic in appearance, it still looked impressive, so you get no real complaining from me, it was just a passing thought.

In the end, ""Hollow Man"" is a visually stunning special effects extravaganza that does a good job of mixing science fiction and horror together into one film. The storyline is somewhat weak in places, and could have benefited from a bit more character development and depth to the story, but the talented actors and actresses in the film, plus the terrific visual effects, more than make up for any short-comings the story had.

Somehow, the team did not have to inform the guys at the top of the defense department and invite the military to witness the event when they decided to experiment on Sebastian himself. The experiment went wrong. Sebastian invisibility became irreversible.

Angry at first, Sebastian soon discovered that he could enter the bathroom without its occupants being aware of his presence. He was also able to snoop on his ex-girlfriend and her new lover. With the power of invisibility, Sebastian leaves the facility and moves on to other more ambitious things. He ended up raping and murdering people who couldn't see him.

Returning to the facility, he sent on to kill everyone who knew his secret. The ending, is of course predictable. The special effects are simply fantastic, but definitely not for those with weak stomachs. The story is also not as unbelievable as some reviewers say it is.

So far so good. But if the come-back, return, homecoming is impossible, what happens to the psyche, to the psychological craziness of the mad scientist who tried his invisibility potion on himself? He gets crazy.

That's simple and then he starts killing everyone and then covering his invention by destroying every evidence and trace of it. Don't ever think it is to prevent other people from doing the same mistake.

He knows there will always be one who will invent the thing again. It is only to cover up his crimes because he became a rapist and a killer of women in the meantime, revealing the shallowness of such scientists who just want to be invisible in order to become the perfect voyeur.

1319357,3,B00003CXKA,"This is a reasonably entertaining movie with stunning visual effects. It is really a modern day version of a mad scientist movie.

The plot is a little thin. It basically revolves around Kevin Bacon's character, Dr. Sebastian Caine, an egotistical, self absorbed scientific genius who, during the course of his work for the Department of Defense, has managed to render animals to an invisible state and return them to visibility. He does not reveal to the Department of Defense, his financial benefactor, that his work has succeeded. Instead, he ignores protocols and decides that the time has come to take his experimentation to the next level and try it on a human being, himself.

To make a long story short, Caine goes ahead with the human experimentation, only to find that he is unable to replicate the success he had with the laboratory animals and render himself visible again, once rendered invisible. He begins to deteriorate mentally, sinking into an inexplicable and bizarre maniacal state until he is totally out of control.

Moreover, Caine, the acknowledged genius of a scientific assemblage, is aware that he is losing it. Yet, he does nothing to assist in the discovery of what went wrong with the experiment and what could be done to correct the problem. He, instead, inexplicably leaves the solution to the self-acknowledged lesser capabilities of his colleagues. This simply does not compute with the film's portrayal of Caine's inherent character.

There is virtually no explanation for Bacon's rapid descent into apparent madness, where his antics range from naughty and not nice to totally evil and depraved. This is a big hole in the story, and Bacon's character reflects this omission, as the viewer is not moved to feel any compassion for him. The character of Caine is, in essence, just a mechanism used to facilitate a lot of action scenes with great special effects.

Therein lies the rub. Caine, as a character, has no redeeming value or quality. In other words he is no Jekyll and Hyde. He is just Hyde. This is why, I believe the movie has been so panned by most viewers, even though they may not have articulated it as such.

With such great visual effects, I am also surprised that more attention was not paid to production details. A latex mask created for Caine does not appear to have breathing holes for the nostrils. The film also occasionally segues into the absurd. In one scene, the ease with which plastic bags of blood were ripped open with one character's bare hands defied reality. I have a harder time ripping open a plastic bag of carrots. In another scene, Caine's character is torched with a flame thrower over, and over, and over again. Yet, like the energizer bunny, he keeps on going. This was simply not believable. The film is fraught with a number of moments of implausibility.

The story is about a genius researcher named Sebastian (Kevin Bacon) who is working on a top-secret project on invisibility for the Pentagon.  A young, exceedingly large-egoed individual, Sebastian has his research team cowed and under his thumb.  The team lets him bend - or break - the rules because they genuinely admire his genius and believe in his ability.  This blind faith proves to be their undoing.  Sebastian tests the invisibility serum on himself.  He disappears, all right, but the problem lies in making himself visible again.  Although the procedure worked on primates, it won't work on him.

The increased time of being invisible also plays on his mind and makes him paranoid and aggressive.  Hollow Man has tons of gratuitous female nudity and sexual assaults, not to mention very disturbing animal abuse.  A screaming rat is tortured and mangled, a gentle lab dog is smashed against a cage, a female gorilla is subjected to immense pain during an experiment.

Yes, the special effects are amazing - but although Hollow Man has an interesting premise and main character, the violence is shocking and horrific, and reveals an underlying core of something like misogyny against women.",1156377600,6,1243,5.044117647058823

However, I tend to agree with most viewers is that while Kevin Bacon (who even though is invisible for much of this movie, still brings across one of his best performances-he brings that wispy, whispering voice to top notch evil heights) does great and Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, and the other actors give their all, Bacon's character is so one sided.  Never before have I watched a movie where I was genuinely angry in wanting to see the bad guy get his in the end.  When Elizabeth Shue finally gets him in the end and is telling him where to go, I was saying it right along with her!

And assaulting women, killing dogs, spiraling out of control into the final movie chapter which was reminiscent of gory splatter slasher flicks of the 80's, I'm deciding right now whether I can actually watch this movie again or whether I want to take it to the Good Will!

1319363,1,B00003CXKA,"HG Wells must be rolling over in his grave. This is yet one more example of clever CGI and a talented crew being wasted on a really lousy script and lazy execution. Gary Scott Thompson (I) and Andrew W. Marlowe are credited for the incredibly poor story and penning. It is mystifying to me how even Marlowe and Thompson, whom we can thank for the awful End of Days and K-911, would be able to screw up the enduring fable of the Invisible Man. For all I know, these two might be capable of intelligent writing, but somehow, somewhere, the Hollywood Bonehead Machine gained a firm grip on this film and turned it stupid. Really stupid.

The classic story of the Invisible Man involves a driven scientist who devises a method to make himself invisible. He tries out the treatment on himself, but there are two problems: 1) Invisibility makes him violently psychotic, and 2) he can't change back.

Besides being a wonderful horror story, it is also rich metaphor for impermanence of self. When I first heard about the making of this film, I thought of how the title Hollow Man promised the exploration of this subject.  I imagined reasonably complex characters and at least a nod to the timeless theme of humankind's struggle between id and ego.  Instead, what I saw was a combined rip-off of low-rent slasher/Satan flicks, with startling CGI taking top billing over the storyline. The brutal and graphic killings do not energize the movie; they simply tire the audience. The `surprises' are so overused that none of it is surprising, and I am so done with cartoonish, implausible action scenes that I almost needed an antiemetic during this flick. Anyone out there ever survived a flash-fire in an elevator shaft? These characters survive, since the flames are only licking their feet, have no heat, and apparently produce breathable oxygen. This kind of super-action works as camp -- which Verhoeven is very good at (see RoboCop) -- but not as good science fiction, which is what this story deserves to be treated as. The old and boring slasher plot contrivances range from `We're hunting an invisible, psychotic monster, so let's spit up,' to `Gosh, he looks dead so it's probably safe to turn our backs!' C'mon, guys, Halloween was 22 years old when this film was released. This stuff is just not smart anymore. I am embarrassed for Paul Verhoeven and the cast.

1319431,5,B00003CXKA,"Ok, I personally loved this movie. It has a good cast, good acting and a good storyline. The SFX are amazing but that isn't the only thing that this movie has going for it. The story is about a group of scientists who are experimenting in making animals invisible. The procedure works and finally Kevin Bacon (Sebastian Caine) and his crew decide to try the procedure on humans, without informing the Pentagon about it.

Caine volunteers to be the test subject and although they were able to bring a gorilla back from invisibility, they have problems doing it with Sebastian. The side effects begin to manifest themselves over an extended period of time, much of it to do with sexual frustration. So, Sebastian starts doing a little ""experimentation"" of his own on the female members of his crew, including his former girlfriend. His anger starts to become more and more apparent and uncontrolled as his crew is unable to reverse the procedure.

Finally, he finds out that his former girlfriend, who he still adores, is going steady with another member of his science team. He explodes with anger and begins to take his revenge out on the crew. He also says a very memorable quote:

""It's amazing what you can do when you no longer have to look at yourself in the mirror"" What I think this movie also does, is raise some interesting moral questions for us, as an audience. Would we also behave in a similar manner i.e. become sexually frustrated and behave violently, knowing that we are, more or less, omnipotent?

The title of this movie I also found to be so appropriate. In the obvious, physical sense, ""hollow"" as in empty or void but also in the moral and spiritual sense. Kevin Bacon's character clearly has no morals and his character begins to lack any substance as the film progresses. His love for his former girlfriend becomes more and more a primitive, sexual urge, rather than genuine affection. Nice DVD extras, too.

Well, there you have it. I know I can't change people's opinions on what they think of the movie. They'll either like it or they won't but I wanted to give an explanation as to why the movie appeals to me. Am I just unable to differentiate between good and bad movies?

I've seen Kevin Bacon give much better performances. Apollo 13, for example. The violence in the film is only there for cheap thrills. It's somewhat gratuitous one might say.

1319499,2,B00003CXKA,"Paul Verhoeven directed ""RoboCop"" (1987), ""Total Recall"" (1990), and ""Basic Instinct"" (1992). His films all have a hard edge. ""Hollow Man"" has the edge. It's lacking the brains and heart of the others.
Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant scientist in charge of a US Government-funded underground facility investigating into invisibility serums. They have the ability to turn animals invisible, but up until now there has been no way to reverse it. Now, Sebastian has found a reversal formula, and it works.
Sebastian, afraid his research will be stolen away from him, keeps all records of progress from the military. He is obsessed with power and he doesn't know what to do now that it's all over. (""It feels like the beginning of the end,"" he says.) And so without asking for permission from his funding, Sebastian becomes the first human to turn invisible to the naked eye - the only thing that can pick up his traces are heat goggles that look like something out of a science fiction movie. Oh, wait...
The serum starts to take a deadly turn, however, when Sebastian feels that everyone is out to get him. He is afraid his colleagues will turn him in, and so he traps them underground and starts to kill them off, one-by-one.
His fellow scientists include: Linda (Elisabeth Shue, who somehow gets top billing over Bacon), Matthew (Josh Brolin), Sarah (Kim Dickens), Carter (Greg Grunberg), and Kramer (William Devane). Linda was his ex-lover sometime in the past. Now she's going out with Matthew. Sebastian doesn't like this; it's part of what triggers his ferocious outbreak in the first place. In short, the guy goes crazy and there's nothing they can do about it except pray and hunt him down with their little goggles and stun guns.
Sebastian considers himself God. (""How many times have I told you you're not God? I am."") We can tell from the beginning that he has problems with control and superiority. The serum, which has some serious side effects like those you hear in fine print on commercials for medicine, only unleashes his darker side he tries to conceal.
And Verhoeven has a strong handle on the different phases of his personality change, unlike most films. Unforunately, whereas ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall"" seemed much more serious, ""Hollow Man,"" like his 1997 film ""Starship Troopers,"" feels too over-the-top and goofy for its own good. His earlier films always had a touch of that over-the-top action spectacular stuff. This one has too much.
If there were ever a movie for Paul Verhoeven, it is this. It's the tailor-made film just for him, much like ""RoboCop"" was. He has free roam to create an invisible man who slowly becomes hostile and hunts his victims. Think about ""Total Recall""--remember how Verhoeven's imaginations were perfectly displayed on screen? How real it all was? How gripping and suspenseful?
There's something missing here. It's the perfect material for Verhoeven, and it has his distinctly hard edge, but it is dumb, and it feels more like an average slasher movie with a large budget than a smart thriller. Especially towards the end, which has its fun parts but becomes over-the-top and quite ridiculous. Of course, the bad guy always gets back up for one last scare, but (spoiler alert!) Sebastian gets up three times. And he's not even supernatural -- he's just invisible. He gets torched with a flamethrower, knocked over the head, electrocuted, and blown up his lab facility. Then he manages to climb up an elevator shaft and grab Linda one last time. HUH? And since when does electricity not spread through water? These guys are extremely advanced scientists, yet they never stop to ponder over why basic science knowledge has just been proved incorrect.
I'm being too harsh. I won't lie. The film has its moments of interest and truly amazing special effects--some of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture, in fact. If ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was an opening for live action/animation and ""Terminator 2"" was the breakthrough motion picture for pure special effects, this is the next level. It starts with an intriguing premise, just as ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall"" did, only those two films kept elevating the action, suspense, plot, and emotional attachment, something that ""Hollow Man"" is lacking. Perhaps a better title would have been ""Hollow Movie""?
""Hollow Man"" is rated R for strong violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.",1068768000,10,4403,4.967479674796748
1319597,2,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man was a film that got plenty of commercial time.  I remember its previews, and to be honest, it looked appealing.  Ah, but looks can be deceiving.  It looked like a pretty fascinating horror movie, worth seeing, that maybe it would have some depth and avoid the cheezy mistakes of past horror flicks.  The idea of an invisable man, creating havoc, intrigued me.  So I saw it.  My analysis is that this is a huge disappointment.  The ultimate let down when it comes to potential.
Kevin Bacon is a fine actor, I like him, I really do.  He makes a good hero and villain, and in this one he plays the villain.  He plays Dr. Caine, who turns out to be this reckless, arrogant mad scientist who breaks rules to break ground.  Fine, this is a good character that we can follow.  His ultimate dream, project if you will, is to create invisibility.  So after many animal experiments, he decides to test it, with him as the guinea pig.  Well it works, he's invisible, but he can't change back.  And as it turns out, he doesn't want to.
This is good, but where the potential is dropped is when Sebastian Caine goes berserk.  There really is no reason established in this movie why he suddenly turns to evil and does these murderous, mischievous deeds.  The question ""why"" kept popping into my head during this movie.  I suppose it could be answered that he loved the power of invisibility and never wanted to share it or give it up to anyone else.  Or his envy and jealousy got the better of him.  But this didn't work for me, there needed to be a better reason on why he snapped.
Elisabeth Shue was Sebastian's girlfriend, now is his best buddy's girlfriend, which is where the envy and jealousy comes from.  What I felt would've been better to create the motive was not have the movie start out with Shue being the ex to Sebastian but to have them still be together.  Then have her dump him for the better man.  Soap operish, I know, but at least it gives us a better motive.
Well, you already know the plot, he goes berserk towards the second half of the film.  He molests some pretty young woman in her apartment, then becomes aggressive with Shue, he's rude and utterly evil.  Then he decides he's sick of everyone and he's going to kill them all.  So one by one he hunts each of the team members who work on his project down.  Again, this all came on suddenly.  This film lacks understandment to why Sebastian mutated from this over zealous scientiest into this demonic madman.  He just turns with no real motive.  The plot would be fine if it just gives us a clear and definate reason to why Sebastian turns into this villain.
I thought the special effects were OK, maybe a bit over done.  When he starts becoming invisible, we see his muscles and then his skeleton as he's transforming.  This didn't look very real, it is so clearly recognizable as computer generated effects.  It looked more cartoon like and therefore I wasn't very impressed with the transformation.  I did like it whenever somebody threw something on him to visualize him.  That seemed real and quite believable.
But you know what bugged me the most about this movie?  Despite the sudden switch in Sebastian, despite the failure of potential to enhance the plot, the real issue with this movie is that it's just like all the other corny horror movies out there.  It's got the corny lines, the cheap suspense, the typical ending, and the typical ""take forever to die monster"" formula.
I mean come on, how many horror movies have we seen where it takes forever for the bad guy to die?  First Shue torches him with a blow torch, practically reducing him to standing ash.  But yet, he's as strong as ever and still alive and still standing!  No freaking way!  Then he gets electrocuted and yet he's still alive and strong as ever!  Then he climbs up a ladder, all burnt and fried, trying to get Shue only to get torched again this time for good.  I mean, how corny.  Just die, man.
If this movie had ended it with a more thought provoking, dramatic, maybe even sympathizing fashion we might appreciate this movie a whole lot more.  But because it had to end with cheese, this film does not separate itself from the 1950's ""screamers"" or the 1980's ""blood and guts"" horror flicks.  In the end, this film leaves us unsatisfied because I think most of us saw the potential for this movie, but the director stupidely turns it into a horror movie that we can see any time we want on the USA channel.  Which after only three years old, that is Hollow Man's new home...the TV.  What a hollow movie.

1319601,2,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man (Paul Verhoeven, 2000)
Why, exactly, anyone lets Paul Verhoeven make movies in Hollywood anymore is completely beyond me. Sure, Verhoeven made the cult hit RoboCop (but really, it wasn't all that good a movie), and the Arnold Schwarzenegger money machine Total Recall. But in the world of ""what have you done for me lately,"" why isn't he remembered for Showgirls? Well, the nodding heads in Hollywood haven't green-lighted anything for the guy since Hollow Man, so maybe things are looking up.
Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, your typical mad scientist who, after a whole lot of setup, turns invisible. (No, this isn't a plot spoiler. It was the basis of every trailer released for the movie, despite it having been intended, we assume, as a big plot twist). With a team of assorted misfits, Caine has been working on a secret government invisibility project headed up by one of Caine's old professors, Howard Kramer (William Devane, showing just how far a career can fall in a few short years). Caine, being the megalomaniac scientist he of course is, uses himself as a test subject, and, well, when you make a nasty person invisible... I think you can guess the rest.
First off, remember the flap after Showgirls, when Verhoeven and Esterhasz split, supposedly because Esterhasz was writing scripts too misogynist for Verhoeven? Here's all the proof you could possibly need that it was all a load. Verhoeven and new golden-boy screenwriters Gary Thompson (of the timeless script for The Fast and the Furious) and Andrew W. Marlowe (the even more timeless script for End of Days) do far more female-menacing in this movie than Esterhasz did in any two of his. There's all the usual reactionary stuff one expects from your basic genre film. Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue of Leaving Las Vegas fame), Caine's ex, is now in bed with their other best friend and partner Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin, whose career has gone... well, from The Goonies to here. You do the math). In other words, hmmm, office relationships are a bad thing. Thanks for pointing that out, guys. There's more of a team (mentioned only so I can say ""Joey Slotnick left Boston Public to pursue a movie career... for this? Best decision since David Caruso left NYPD Blue to make Jade), but they're essentially living blood dolls. And with most of the acting in this movie, you end up betting on ""not if, but when.""
Like the movie it completely rips off, The Invisible Man, Hollow Man was made pretty much for the purpose of spending a really big special effects budget. And the effects, for what it's worth, are pretty darn cool. In one of the opening scenes, Caine and his team are testing the invisibility potion on an ape, and they bring the ape back to visibility. Very cool stuff. (Of course, unlike 1933, the way to work in Hollywood today is ""if it looks good, overuse it."" So if you miss the ape scene `cause you're already bored enough to be in the bathroom, don't worry.) Also unlike 1933, it would seem that Hollywood doesn't require things like a decent plot to spend said special effects budget. So if you're looking for a movie where a lot of things go boom (for unrealistic lengths of time, though the big last boom was rather inventive) and a lot of people go squish, Hollow Man will be right up your alley. If you want plot, characterization, intelligence, and real chills, you're probably better off ranting something made by Dario Argento. * ",1059955200,2,3441,4.763819095477387
1319602,3,B00003CXKA,"Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN is not great cinema, granted; however, one could see that from the trailer that it was going to be a pumped-up, amped-up, sci-fi action thriller with incredible (and I do mean incredible) special effects--and on those counts, it delivers big.
The point of this film isn't character development (although I agree that it would have helped); indeed, when the first transformation scene took place, I was ready for the action to happen. Maybe it was all the bad press that I've read/heard since its theatrical release, but my expectations were set mainly for spectacle, not story. On that note, this film did not disappoint.
Kevin Bacon gives a very good performance. He is the right type of actor for this role; with his subtle facial expressions in the early sections of the film, he gives you an idea of certain feelings lurking beneath the surface, beyond what his character expresses in words. He is thusly able to overcome some of the deficiences in the script, which tends to paint with (very) broad strokes.  Elizabeth Shue, oddly receiving first billing, is the dependable center of the action. Bad haircut or not, it's good to see her in anything these days.  Josh Brolin (looking more & more like his Dad James did in his prime), does well in his rather sympathetic role.
Whatever you want to say about Paul Verhoeven, ya gotta admit that he is the undisputed master of the futuristic sci-fi thriller.  After TOTAL RECALL and STARSHIP TROOPERS, he comes out with another film that employs cutting-edge visual effects.  HOLLOW MAN may not be everybody's cup of tea, but guaranteed it will give you a rush.  I may not necessarily want to see it again, but I've definitely never seen anything like it before!",1057190400,3,1741,4.828859060402684

1319604,2,B00003CXKA,"This movie has great special effects.  There.  Now that I've gone out of my way to say something good about this film, here's what's wrong with it:
About three quarters of the film does little more than establish what a childish and jealous egomaniac the character played by Kevin Bacon is.  After he is turned invisible, all he can think of doing with his powers is moving one scientist's drink when she is not looking and molesting a couple of other women.  While Bacon becomes increasingly mentally unstable thanks to the invisibility treatment, the audience is supposed to believe that the so-called brilliant scientists who helped turn him invisible are now unable to turn him visible again because they have suddenly turned so stupid that they don't bother completely replicating the conditions that allowed them to bring a gorilla back from invisibility.  Instead they search for an entirely new way of bringing Bacon back.
Finally, during the last 20 minutes of the film after Bacon completely snaps there is a long battle scene which only makes sense if you believe the good scientists' intelligence levels have now been reduced to that of vegetables.  For example, if the scientists put on their infrared goggles they are able to see the heat patterns of their invisible guinea pigs.  But during the battle sequence they don't bother wearing their goggles for more than 2 seconds at a time (well, okay, one of them finally realizes it might be a good idea to keep them on, but only after Bacon has flooded the area with enough hot steam to hide his own heat signature).  The hero of the tale, played by Shue, is also so stupid that, after turning on the sprinklers so she can see Bacon's outline, she stands in a hallway staring in only one direction, allowing him to just waltz up to her from the other direction and attack her from behind (maybe she thought it was one of those new-fangled one-way halls).  I could go on much longer about how utterly inane this film is, but I won't.
Why can't Verhoeven still make great satires like Robocop instead of unleashing insulting special f/x showcases like this upon the public?",1052611200,5,2134,4.761517615176151

Philly native Kevin Bacon does an excellent job playing the role of Dr. Sebastian Kaine, a brillant scientist working for the U.S. Depatment of Defense who goes off the deep end, Elizabeth Shue plays his co-worker/ex-girlfriend, and Josh Brolin co-stars as another fellow scientist.  Here's a little teaser for ya:  ""Pay close attention on the 1 scene in the movie, where a woman gets attacked by the invisible stalker.""

Bacon is not a convincing scientist.  Renegade--yes.  Madman--absolutely.  Letch--he was perfect.  However, none of these aspects meshed with him being a scientist.  He played out like an adult kid who somehow got permission to fool around with very expensive military-scientific toys.
A serious hole in this plot is the notion that the military would fully fund such an over-the-edge project as phase-shifting to create invisibility--and then not demand oversight.  We are supposed to believe that a bunch of gen-X scientists would be allowed to run a super-pricey military project without so much as an MP in the laboratory?

1319699,2,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man could've been so much better but it just wasn't. Hollow Man takes the idea of the classic Sci Fi movie The Invisible Man and gives it a total shake up. Kevin Bacon plays a government scientist that is testing the possibilies of becoming invisible.
He and his team test this new and possibly revolutionary idea on of course, animals and finally, their hopes and works come true as they rematerialize an invisible gorilla. Thinking that Bacon is safe, he has his team turn him invisible hoping that he will be able to rematerialize as well. Things start to go wrong as Bacon and his team are unable to bring him back, he then goes insane and furious and starts taking his revenge on his team, government officials and anyone else that gets in his way.
O.k. now here's the bad news. Now normally that sounds really good, but in this day and age, 5 star special effects don't and can't help a poor script and bad plotted movies. I'll say it, it was a great idea but it was poorly executed. Don't get me wrong, the effects are awesome, phenomenal and nothing else was like them. The problem was that the plot was so vast and doubtful (even for Sci Fi) that it made the movie cheap.
The other thing that made this one bad was that the characters in the movie (aside from Bacon), might as well have been air brushed in because for the most part, it seemed like they didn't matter because the supporting cast felt nonexistant. None of them gave strong performances or even had adequate dialogue to match Bacon's (and even his was not that impressive).
I think the lesson here is that it's no longer the 80's and that when movies have great effects and bad scripts, don't be too surprised if you feel let down because of that. It's good to have high expectations in the viewing of your choice. It's just that Hollow Man shouldn't be a part of that.",1037664000,2,1850,4.444117647058824

Elizabeth Shue is such a hottie and the all the good characters did very nice jobs. The plot moves fast and the action and suspense grows with every minute of the film.  It's a great combination of sci-fi, action, suspense, and even a little horror.  Don't mess with a man you can't see.

1319702,3,B00003CXKA,"This is a reasonably entertaining movie with stunning visual effects. It is really a modern day version of a mad scientist movie.
The plot is a little thin. It basically revolves around Kevin Bacon's character, Dr. Sebastian Caine, an egotistical, self absorbed scientific genius who, during the course of his work for the Department of Defense, has managed to render animals to an invisible state and return them to visibility. He does not reveal to the Department of Defense, his financial benefactor, that his work has succeeded. Instead, he ignores protocols and decides that the time has come to take his experimentation to the next level and try it on a human being, himself.
To make a long story short, Caine goes ahead with the human experimentation, only to find that he is unable to replicate the success he had with the laboratory animals and render himself visible again, once rendered invisible. He begins to deteriorate mentally, sinking into an inexplicable and bizarre maniacal state until he is totally out of control.
Moreover, Caine, the acknowledged genius of a scientific assemblage, is aware that he is losing it. Yet, he does nothing to assist in the discovery of what went wrong with the experiment and what could be done to correct the problem. He, instead, inexplicably leaves the solution to the self-acknowledged lesser capabilities of his colleagues. This simply does not compute with the film's portrayal of Caine's inherent character.
There is virtually no explanation for Bacon's rapid descent into apparent madness, where his antics range from naughty and not nice to totally evil and depraved. This is a big hole in the story, and Bacon's character reflects this omission, as the viewer is not moved to feel any compassion for him. The character of Caine is, in essence, just a mechanism used to facilitate a lot of action scenes with great special effects.
Therein lies the rub. Caine, as a character, has no redeeming value or quality. In other words he is no Jekyll and Hyde. He is just Hyde. This is why, I believe the movie has been so panned by most viewers, even though they may not have articulated it as such.
With such great visual effects, I am also surprised that more attention was not paid to production details. A latex mask created for Caine does not appear to have breathing holes for the nostrils. The film also occasionally segues into the absurd. In one scene, the ease with which plastic bags of blood were ripped open with one character's bare hands defied reality. I have a harder time ripping open a plastic bag of carrots. In another scene, Caine's character is torched with a flame thrower over, and over, and over again. Yet, like the energizer bunny, he keeps on going. This was simply not believable. The film is fraught with a number of moments of implausibility.
If you are willing to suspend belief and just sit back and accept the movie at face value, however, one should stll be able to reasonably enjoy this movie, as it does, despite the plot holes, have its moments, and the visual effects are dazzling.",1029456000,10,3074,4.834914611005693
1319703,3,B00003CXKA,"I loved the premise of this movie: a group of scientists trying to crack through what could be a major discovery of turning animals and possibly humans invisible. In fact, I felt like the first two-thirds of this movie was decent enough. However, then as many movies do of this caliber, it got extremely rediculous. Kevin Bacon offered little to the movie; I actually felt as though many of the other characters were better developed. Bacon acts so cocky and tries to be the ""bad"" boy so much that it is kind of sickening towards the end of the movie. And, of course, after becoming the invisible man, he goes mad and then proceeds to become ""God"" (or so he says). Why is it that when someone is shot, stabbed, or, in this case, engulfed with fire like a summer hot dog, they never die in Hollywood movies?  They come back like 2,3, 4 times and still go after the person who is trying to destroy them. Then of course, Elizabeth Shue's character says her line ""Go to hell"" (in the manner of ""Hasta La Vista"") and the villian falls to his death (apparently, because you never really know). Anyhow, I hope this didn't sound too harsh. There were some cool special effects. I recommend this movie if you are a sci-fi fan, but don't expect anything great. Kevin Bacon is probably regretting making this one.",1026432000,2,1302,4.516949152542373
1319791,2,B00003CXKA,"Within the realm of Science Fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success.  The first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G. Wells classic, ""The Time Machine.""  The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities.  And this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another H.G. Wells classic, ""The Invisible Man,"" the realization of which, here, is ""Hollow Man,"" directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the U.S. Government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method.  They have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original ""visual"" state of being.  It's a problem, however,  that Caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved-- or so he thinks.  And when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.
At the last minute, though, Caine demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject.  And he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so.  But something goes wrong, and Caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all begins to take a toll on Caine's mind.  And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that.  Now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- Including himself.
Verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the F/X at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development.  Anyone familiar with ""The Invisible Man,"" or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times.  Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience.  But he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood-and-gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film.  Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to Caine's suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film.  And it's a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.
Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves Verhoeven's purposes perfectly.  There's little depth to Bacon's portrayal, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities.  Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon the time to develop Caine to any extent; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works.  The film would have been better served, however, had Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an F/X laden extravaganza.
Elisabeth Shue comports herself well in the role of Linda McKay, Caine's willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of Shue's caliber.  The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film, ""Things Behind the Sun"").  Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action and F/X.  Both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.
The supporting cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer).  Entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain (low) level, ""Hollow Man"" is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been.  Like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, without anything special to set it apart.  And it's too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more.",1025654400,4,5940,4.94572864321608
1319792,3,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man is an awful film.  Director Paul Verhoeven seemed unable to decide whether to create a fast pace horror film, or to focus upon the existential questions of one becoming invisible.  Would invisibility inherently weaken one's bonds with the wider human community?  Is the temptation of exploiting such a condition too strong to resist?  Verhoeven instead opted for some admittedly fantastic special effects to salvage a very mediocre script.  This rarely, if ever succeeds---and most certainly didn't work with Hollow Man.  Also, who is responsible for the mediocre music score?  It reminded me of the quickly thrown together music that was prevalent in the B movies of the 1960s.
Kevin Bacon portrays the egotistical scientist, Sebastian Caine, who is the executive director of a military program to turn people invisible.  He jokes about being God, but it is obvious that he at least half believes this to be true.  The gorgeous Linda McKay (Elizabeth Shue) is a member of his research team who has romantically left him for the less gifted scientist Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin).  They have long experimented upon animals with a fair degree of success.  Now it is time to take it to the next step and pick a human guinea pig.  The arrogant and self centered Dr. Caine chooses himself while disregarding all ethical norms and regulations.  Caine finds himself ultimately trapped by his invisibility, and lashes out against the cruel set of circumstances dooming him to the fringes of human society.  He surrenders to the temptation to sexually violate women. Soon even murder is no longer considered a line in the sand not to be crossed.  The story rapidly becomes convoluted and absurd.  Logic is thrown out the window, and Verhoeven can do little more than throw extremely violent and cruel scenes onto the screen.  The makers of Hollow Man likely realized the film was doomed.  They simply wanted to get it over with and hope for the best.
Only those fans of spectacular special effects should make a point of viewing this lackluster movie.  Hollow Man deserves a mere three stars.  This is a pity because the central theme is thought provoking and fraught with wonderful possibilities.",1024099200,4,2204,5.002747252747253

1319799,2,B00003CXKA,"Being an ardent fan of science fiction, I had hoped that Hollow Man would be decent. In its special effects, I was not disappointed. The art of computer generated images [CGI] is advancing rapidly. The line between what is real and what is a computer graphic is becoming quite blurred, and I am in awe of this technology. Some things in life remain the same, however, and the need for a good, coherent storyline is one of them. Hollow Man lacks this, and, as a result, the movie is just so-so.
Much of the movie takes place in a secret government lab deep below the surface of Washington, DC. There, a team of scientists, led by Sebastian Caine [Kevin Bacon] has almost perfected a process which renders people and other mammals invisible. Caine convinces two other workers, Linda and Matthew [Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin], to proceed with a test on a human being, namely Caine himself. The Pentagon doesn't know about this, but the trio doesn't tell this to the rest of the crew. The experiment proceeds. Caine becomes invisible, but the antidote fails. The group must then figure out what went wrong so that they can make Caine visible again. As time drags on, Caine, a volatile, egocentric guy even before the experoment, becomes increasingly unstable. Very bad things begin to occur.
The people who made Hollow Man do not seem to have the imagination to explore the subject of becoming invisible very far. That's a shame, because the possibilities are virtually endless. What's worse, they don't have much feel for either drama or comedy. It's always dangerous when filmmakers take shallow ideas and get serious about them. In this case, Caine was once Linda's lover, but she wisely dumped him. Now Matthew is her lover, but she doesn't want Caine to find out, even though the three spend about eighteen hours a day working together. How interesting or original is that for a plot idea? In a place where some mammals are invisible and others aren't, there are lots of setups for comedy. Hollow Man makes use of none of them. So short on ideas were director Paul Verhoeven and his crew that the movie turns into a slasher flick for no good reason other than that Caine seems to be having a bad week.
The CGI effects truly are wondrous, and they make the movie worth watching, at least for technophiles. The ways in which we see Caine are ingenious. The scene in which he turns invisible is amazing.
One area of the movie's script truly annoyed me. Every main character is either a scientist or a doctor, hand picked for their genius and intelligence. Just consider the scope of their project. Yet most of them are rarely able to utter a complete sentence. Much worse, none of them can say more than a dozen words without using a four-letter word. As an ardent supporter of freedom of speech, I do not note this out of any moral sense. I note it because it is utterly implausible that such bright and educated people could express themselves only in vulgar and unoriginal ways. Is this the only way Hollywood can find to let teenagers, who are the bulk of the audience today, relate to such characters? If so, the intelligence of young people is being vastly underrated.",1016323200,3,3175,4.671428571428572

As a matter of fact, the only thing wrong with it (and it doesn't really bother me all that much) is the excessive perversion of the movie.  I've been able to get past the cons of this movie and focus on the pros.  Also, all these people worked really really really hard on this movie.  I mean, give them at least little credit please?
I am also very pleased at the DVD except for the fact that they interrupt a couple of the deleted scenes with Paul Verehoeven commentary.  I wish they had just made it an optional audio-only commentary, so we can see the entire thing.  The best part of the DVD is the isolated score track because the Varese Sarabande soundtrack album does not have all the cues.  Yes, I think this should silence all the individuals (such as me) that complain about lack of extras.  This baby has everything.  Deleted scenes, commentary by a cast member and a couple of the crew, isolated score w/composer commentary, one behind-the-scenes featurette which is then broken up into 15 to talk about all the individual aspects of making the movie.  I do kind of wish they had included one on the making of the score, since they have one on everything else.
This is one of the best DVDs ever.  It gets the treatment that more DVDs should, but don't.  I think the movie's fine.  It's just something you have to develop a taste for.

1319845,2,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man is typical special effects driven summer movies. It has more style over substance. However, the movie is pretty entertaining and fun. Well, in the last half hour or so anyways. The effects are, of course, outstanding. The movie stars the always reliable Kevin Bacon as scientist Sebastian Kane(if that doesn't sound like a soap opera name, I don't know what does). He's a cocky, arrogant type of guy who, with his crew, which also includes Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue, is experimenting on
invisibility. He then decides to try it on himself. It succeeds and he's invisible. The longer it lasts however, the more it starts to drive him insane. Bacon is good, as usual, but the supporting players are all routine. Josh Brolin, however, is pretty decent. The movie has what you'd expect from a Paul Verhoeven film. Action, violence, nudity. It's fun in that area, but if your looking for something deeper and memorable, your not gonna find it here. There are many clever set pieces that are quite effective. Many scenes are very eerie as well when he's stalking the trapped scientists. Once agin, the effects are eye popping and the entertainment is pretty high. Ignore the mean and nasty review on some page about making fun of Elisabeth Shue's name. How horrible is that?.

1319846,3,B00003CXKA,"Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant but evil scientist.  With that european surname, he's the kind of evil scientist you'd expect to find in a movie by Paul Verhoeven - he's into rough sex, voyeurism, junk food, fast cars and self-deification.  Unfortunately, he's also working on developing a radioactive serum that turns living matter invisible.  While animals have been able to shift from invisibility and back again, Caine finds himself stuck when he impulsively has himself injected.  Never a nice guy, the prolonged invisibility turns Caine predatory at first, then sociopathic and finally homicidal.  A further complication - the project is funded by some covert arm of the government which stymies attempts to reign Caine in when he starts showing his true self.  It also requires that the team work out of a high-tech looking underground complex - where Caine traps the project members and sets the stage for a hyperviolent climactic duel of wits.
While the flick has some great effects, but the weak story and uneven pacing kill it.  Even the effects lose their bite when the movie tries to hang everything it has onto them when the deficiencies in plot and charahcter are too obvious.  The duel between Bacon and his ex-colleagues seems too short - the others come off as incredibly stupid, almost as if they deserve what's coming for them.  Even Elisabeth Shue seems too clueless to qualify as a master scientist.  There are some good bits - like how Shue's charachter escapes from a locked freezer, but that kind of smart thinking has lower profile in this movie than an invisible man.",1004227200,,1607,4.940520446096654

A driven, eccentric scientist (Kevin Bacon) carries out an elaborate and risky experiment, in which he uses himself as a guinea-pig in order to acquire the power of being invisible. He unexpectedly puts his new ability into violent and amoral uses, in an orgy of murder and revenge against enemies, as well as some of his colleagues who thwarted, opposed, or underestimated him. The special effects are splendid, and they are the film's main saving grace. They seem essential to the unfolding of the story, with its ultraviolent and intermittently gripping build-ups. The acting is perfunctionary at best, the script mediocre, containg little originality. Two scenes: (the opening shot of the rat in the test laboratory, as well as the gorilla episode) are particularly noticable, and attest to the skill and dynamism of Paul Verhoeven's direction, which is unfortunately wasted on such lacklustre material, easily exceeded by some of his earlier films, e.g.""Robocop"", ""Total Recall"", ""Basic Instinct"".",1001203200,,1120,5.442528735632184

His acting isn't at all impressive, although his part in the movie doesn't allow for him to be.  For that matter, the acting of Elisabeth Shue isn't any good, either.  None of the acting is.  And there are many technical questions I have and think are funny.  For example, when injected with the invisible liquid, the people miracuously disappear from the outside and it works its way in towards the internal organs and bones.  But, when injected in the same vein with the reappearing agent, they strangely begin reappearing from the inside then moving outward.

It just about has nothing in common with any of his other movie except for two things: the violence and the nudity.  That is how you can tell a Verhoeven movie from any other director's movies is the shocking and in a way artistic way of showing violence.  Anyone can do nudity, but anyway back to the movie.  The movie has some to the most beautiful special effects around.  One scene in particular involves a gorilla that they are making invisible.  It isn't like the old movies where if they turn something invisible they just slowly fade out, here we see each individual body part on the gorilla disappear.  The skin, the limbs, the internal organs, veins, everthing.  Then later we actually see the Kevin Bacon turn invisible.  These are all good but the story is something that they could have worked on.

""Average customer rating is 2 1/2  stars???  What the heck is wrong with you people.  This movie is awesome!  It has some of the best effects ever created!  The story is great, the action rocks, and it's REALLY scary!  The acting is great, the directing is great and the f/x are spontanious!  This movie is excellent- the best sci-fi thriller of 2000!  I mean, it was nominated for BEST VISUAL EFFECTS at the Academy Awards!  ""Gladiator"" didn't have the BEST VISUAL EFFECTS though, HOLLOW MAN had the best!  And PERFECT STORM was nominated for the BIG WAVES!  What a joke!  CAST AWAY had those same awesome waves in a big storm, but that movie wasn't nominated!

The only reason this gets 1 stars from me is because of the special effects which I appreciate as very ambitious (not to mention you have to give atleast one). Other than that this movie should of never been made. I find it very hard to believe a egotistical Porche driving genius doctor can't find a girlfriend in Washington D.C. But of couse he can't and thus Hollowman was born. This movie has all the tell tale traits of a director who is overwhelmed with tecnology and basically issued a blank check to ILM. Ofcouse Paul Verhoven is no novice director and should of taken control of this mess or conveniently lost all of the footage and written the whole mess off. Unfortunatly he didn't and now his brilliant career will be forever tarnished. My advice to viewers would be to curl up and watch this DVD only if you are stuck in a broken elevator for a long period of time.

Ten minutes into it, I was unsuccessfully trying to slit my wrists with my soft drink straw.  I don't even know where to begin condemning it.
Okay, first off, the acting is really lousy.  I mean, the Carrot Top movie had more accomplished actors than this disgrace.  Second,the screenplay was at about the writing level of a second grader.  The movie lacked all the good stuff, like character development, emotional resonance, tension, and intelligence.  Instead, we were left with the standard Hollywood sex and gore, and plenty of it!  This movie had more unnecessary blood and guts than all the previous Paul Verhoven movies put together. It was obscene.  Speakng of which, there were like fifty scenes of the invisible man molesting his female victims. It was disgusting.  And no, I don't needto see Kevin Bacon's nether regions that often, thank you very much.
Some movies are described as bloody car wrecks. ""The Hollow Man"" is the celluloid equivilent of the Chernobyl disaster.  I mean, Paul screwed up big time with ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Showgirls"", but at least they were the fun kind of bad.  This movie, however, doesn't merely stink.

The film starts with great special effects.  First, the ape is returned to the visible and then Kevin Bacon is made invisible.  These were incredibly cool moments.  What follows is a masterpiece of erotic filmmaking as Bacon sneaks around molesting a few women and terrorizing others.  This was an ultimate voyeuristic moment and made the movie worth watching.
However, instead of continuing in this vein.  The invisible Bacon returns to the lab to murder his co-workers.  The film becomes a stupid, over the top bloodbath.  It becomes the kind of film where characters take crowbars to the head and aren't really hurt.  Stupid not suspensful, and unexciting.

Because, simply, it shows that you can have the best special effects in the world, and it doesn't mean anything if you put them in the wrong story.  Here's the thing: I *love* the concept of the Invisible Man for a horror movie.  It lends itself to perfect, Hitchcockian suspense: you just point the camera at a person alone in their room, doing ordinary things, and the audience will go out of their minds wondering if that person is as alone as they appear to be.  No special effects whatsoever are necessary.  ""Hollow Man"" by contrast, has some really amazing special effects.  I will give it that much, but so what?  The whole point of having an invisible man is not knowing where he will be at a given time.  This movie actually goes to great pains to make damn sure you know exactly where Kevin Bacon is at all times, and left me wondering why invisibility, specifically, was the plot device.  It could have just as easily been, say, super-strength, and the plot would be essentially no different.

I can't believe Elizabeth Shue and Kevin Bacon went for this movie, the script must have smelled like an outhouse on the hottest day of the year. Pe-yew!
Except for special effects, there are no redeeming qualities in the movie. The first thing that stood out for me was... if the guy's eyelids are transparent, aren't his eyes transparent too? Doesn't that mean he's blind? There are dozens of little problems with the whole invisibility thing that were not thought out AT ALL!
Plot ideas: Invisibility turns you into a homicidal maniac in about 10 days or so. All scientific types are jerks who think they are God and don't bother following the rules, they break the rules in the name of science!
Anyway, I can't recommend the movie to anyone unless they are dying to see the special effects or just are huge Kevin Bacon fans.",989193600,2,1496,4.62781954887218

1320093,1,B00003CXKA,"Note: This review contains minor spoilers, though there isn't much to spoil, plus you'll be doing yourself a huge favor if you read the review instead of seeing the movie.
I don't think I've ever rushed this fast to give something a bad review.  Most of the other reviews say it all...but I desperately *need* to write down how bad this movie is and hopefully purge it from my system. You know, I don't ask for the impossible when I sit down to watch a movie. All I really want from a movie, at minimum, is to be entertained or to escape for 90 minutes or so. The movie started out OK but after the gorilla scene, and the two other invisible transformation scenes, it really went downhill. And got worse.
Oh yeah, in case you haven't seen the trailer, or read a review, the plot is: a group of scientists is working on an invisibility formula, for the government. The leader of the project is smart, but an arrogant jerk. He 'meddles with mother nature' (a no-no in a scary movie) and deliberately deceives people who trust him (again, another mistake) so the formula can be tested on him as the first human. You'll never guess what happens then: things go horribly wrong! People turn to murder!  Disaster strikes! You waste 2 hours of your time and a rental fee because you could have just watched the trailer, which gave the whole plot away anyway!
I had low expectations for this movie-all I wanted was for something to surprise me, or there to be a special effect or shock that made me watch the scene/moment again a couple times. Or at least want to. For instance, ""Deep Blue Sea"" was stupid and mainly lame, but at least had that one big surprise (you know the one I mean-I won't give it away like someone did to me before I saw it). Nope.
I didn't find any of the characters likable. Sorry, but I don't have too much respect for any character in a horror/thriller movie that does any of the following: 1. walks backward when they know they are in danger 2. turns their back on someone dangerous that they've conked/injured and strolls casually away without checking to see if they've really been incapacitated 3. immediately separates when they first realize they are in an isolated area being stalked by someone or 4. says something to the effect of ""well, I'm glad *that's* over"" when things obviously aren't-and if you've seen even one other scary movie, everyone knows this is always a precursor to the villain/monster immediately swooping down on them again or lunging into frame.  This movie has ALL of the above-which I could overlook if the movie was at least slightly entertaining (Bruce Campbell in any of the Evil Dead movies usually does all of the above, but makes it fun to watch, to name just one example).
  Also-and I see by the other reviews that I'm not alone here- I get really insulted when, especially on top of all the other crud, a villain conveniently becomes indestructible in the last half hour or so with no explanation. About every possible debilitating injury happens to him and it doesn't seem to slow him down. All that was missing was him being shot and the bullets bouncing off him.
  I expected there to be one interesting or memorable concept, especially since (I thought at the time) the movie had such meticulous attention to detail and seemed to take a very high-tech, scientific approach to the story. The trailers and background info on the making of this film, plus how long it took in post-production, gave me that impression. The reviews gave it more credit than it had. I was at first slightly interested in the fact that an invisible character couldn't close their eyes, because they had transparent eyelids. I never thought of that! Hmmm, maybe they came up with some other cool twists. No. That's about as inventive as it gets, and the only new idea they came up with. (then, that got shot all to hell, because about 1 minute later it occurred to me that the person could wear a sleep mask, or go in a completely blacked-out room). An invisible gorilla graphically re-materializing, layer by layer? OK, that hasn't been done before, at least not that I know of, but that's maybe 30 seconds that are slightly interesting. Let's face it, you thinking ""hey, good CGI"" occasionally is not enough to build a good movie on- in fact, it's a pretty sad statement when that's all you can say about a movie.
I would run out of room if I listed even half the continuity errors. Just look at the goofs page on the IMDB. Now, I'm the type of person who people have to point out continuity errors to before I notice them. Here I noticed ones I didn't even LOOK for. What happened? Did they run out of time? Money? The studio rushed them? What's really depressing is someone probably noticed, but they either were too lacy to care or figured the audience would be so impressed with the CGI that their IQs would drop about 50 points and they'd miss it. Not to beat a dead horse, but if the movie had a character that was interesting, or if any scenes surprised me, or entertained me, I could overlook it being stupid and built around some 'ground-breaking' CGI.  Yes, I know what a 'popcorn movie/turn off your brain movie' is, where you just sit back and enjoy the mindless ride. Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Scary Movie- *those* are popcorn movies. It's also not a camp/so bad it's good type movie. Showgirls, Mommy Dearest, Glen or Glenda- those are ones you can sit and make fun of with your friends. No, instead The Hollow Man is just a waste of everyone's time and money, and that's putting it in way more polite terms than I want to.
I would only recommend this if you are a CGI/FX junkie, if you thought ""Speed 2"" and ""The Klumps"" were deep, insightful masterpieces of cinema history and you didn't understand why everyone said anything bad about them, or if you really have the hots for Kevin Bacon (though skip the 'becoming invisible' scene, among others, if you don't want to get completely turned off).

1320097,2,B00003CXKA,"Hollow Man
Score: 45/100
This is basically a double episode of the TV show The Invisible Man. There is not much else to be said, except how lacking this film is in both a horrific and dramatic atmosphere. No, wait! I forgot all the other bad things about Hollow Man! Oh, well, I might as well put them into a review. Here goes!
A group of scientists, led by the brilliant yet eccentric twinkle-addicted Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), are successfully researching invisibility. Having accomplished making animals invisible, Caine insists on being the next subject for the experiment. Unfortunately, the serum effects not only the external physical nature of the subject, but morphs the internal personality too. And that's when things start to go horribly wrong...
And that is also where the script and lots of other things start to go wrong in the film. Hollow Man starts promisingly, with a shocking opening scene and a thrilling gorilla chase, but it quickly puts itself down and starts to be overly-silly, using a whole bunch of original ideas to try and keep the audiences entertained, while all we're doing in our seats is yawning and trying to keep our eyes open as much as possible. The performances are awful, Elisabeth Shue is just so terrifyingly horrid in her role that she deserves a big, fat Razzie, and a gigantic knife in the back. Kevin Bacon overacts stupidly, and turns what could've been a chilling performance into one big joke. The characters Shue, Bacon and all their co-star's play are far from likeable, and Paul Verhoeven's direction effort isn't plausible, it seemed like all he was waiting for was the fake-looking and typical CGI ending we see in crappy blockbusters just like this ones.
Not exactly the worst film of 2000, but this is far from been anything but a wannabe and completely pointless invisible man `thriller.'",985392000,5,1851,4.898089171974522

1320206,1,B00003CXKA,"This movie not only had an invisible man, but it also had some invisible plot connections.  I'll just use the end of the movie as an example.  Okay, so somehow hot scientist chick(Elisabeth Shue), is hot enough so that her hotness can counteract -40 degree temperatures.  In these conditions she manages to create an electromagnet to escape her certain doom.  Somehow in these ridiculously cold environment she is able to open the door with her electromagnet.  So following that issue flesh wound scientist man(Josh Brolin)  is able to recover from being stabbed with an oversized crow bar and frozen for five minutes to eventually whack the invisible Kevin Bacon with the very same crowbar.  Then Kevin Bacon turns into skeletal muscle man after another attack with the infamous crowbar is thwarted.
After this hot scientist chick and flesh wound scientist man run to the elevator shaft in an attempt to escape their inevitable fate in the exploding lab.  As they climb to the top, somehow the flying elevator of doom manages to zoom past them, propelled by the explosion in the laboratory below.  Then as the elevator falls victim to that pesky force of gravity, it somehow stops just above their heads.  Shortly after this skeletal muscle Bacon has not only managed to survive an attack with the infamous crowbar, the giant lab explosion, and the flying elevator of doom, but in doing so has managed to climb undetected onto the back of hot scientist chick, who seduces him with a last kiss before she sends him plummeting down the elevator shaft into the exploding lab.  Then as she falls into the arms of flesh wound scientist man, he exclaims, ""Oh my god!""  To which she replies, ""Not anymore.""  Based on the whole premise that Kevin Bacon is God.  Which might offer some sort of explanation of that six degree thing, but really offers no explanation of this ridiculous movie.",984960000,8,1882,4.840625
1320207,4,B00003CXKA,"""Hollow Man,"" directed by Paul Verhoeven, is a sci-fi thriller that takes on a classic theme: invisibility. Although this topic has been portrayed in numerous movies, TV programs, and comic books, ""Hollow Man"" distinguishes itself with a combination of cutting edge special effects and menacing thrills. Kevin Bacon plays the film's main character, Dr. Sebastian Caine--whose name struck me as a subtle biblical reference to the ""mark of Cain"" (Genesis 4:15)
The effects are truly the star of the film, and the filmmakers exploit the invisibility motif in many memorable scenes. Sequences such as a hunt for an invisible escaped gorilla are shot with flair. Good production values add to the film's visual appeal: every would-be ""mad scientist"" would drool over the high-tech laboratory created for Dr. Caine. But be forewarned: the film's gory violence may not be suitable for all viewers.
The only real flaw of the film lies in the characterizations. Bacon's Dr. Caine is an unlikeable, arrogant creep who shows his disregard for both human and animal life from his first scenes. The film's one almost sympathetic character, a soft-hearted veterinarian, is whiny and annoying. As a result, I found myself not caring much for any of these characters. But this criticism aside, ""Hollow Man"" is an entertaining and visually stunning thrill ride.",984873600,3,1344,5.226851851851852
1320208,3,B00003CXKA,"This film's strength is neither the special effects nor the action sequences, but rather the time it spends exploring the psychological realm: anger, jealousy, and of course, what you would do if you never had to look at yourself in the mirror.
Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, an egotistical scientist who is leading a government-funded project on invisibility. Caine is so determined to make his project work that he sidesteps Pentagon authorization and brashly makes himself the study's first human test subject.
Trouble arises with the invisibility antidote, however, and Caine is unable to regain opacity. This turn of events, and his subsequent extended confinement to his underground lab, quickly bring out the dark side of Caine's megalomaniac personality. He begins to vent his emotions in most unhealthy ways, violently seeking outlets for his bitterness over a recent split with his girlfriend, his jealousy and rage towards her new lover, and his obsession with the female neighbor he watches through his window. Drawing on the premise that invisibility eliminates feelings of guilt, Hollow Man has Sebastian become a very, very bad man.
The dilemma, of course, lies in how to stop him: what do you do to defend yourself against a man that you can't even see? The situation is resolved, but not before Caine creates an enormous bloodbath, and unfortunately not before I began to lose interest in the film. Near its end, Hollow Man begins to transform into a fairly rote action movie, complete with fireballs and (spoiler alert!) a dramatic escape through an unstable elevator shaft. Trust me, you've seen it all before.
One advantage of the DVD format is that the discriminating viewer can skip fairly directly to the middle of the movie, which is where the psychologically-driven sequences lie and is the part worth watching. The rest, honestly, is rather hollow.",984787200,8,1878,5.140522875816994
1320209,3,B00003CXKA,"The special effects are the real winners this time since the movie itself is sort of a mix of thriller, horror, and mad scientist film.  After the first thirty minutes or so, after Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian, is turned invisible, the film goes downhill, degenerating into a standard run around thriller.  It's not that the movie is actually all that bad, but it could have been so much more if anyone had really thought about what they were doing and was more interested in telling a story than in using special effects just to show us what they could do.
 Granted, I could possibly see how being turned invisible could affect your mind, and even eventually turn you psychotic, but it just happens so fast in this movie, almost from the get go.  There had to have already been problems going on in Dr. Sebastian's mind for him to snap so fast, and the reasoning behind him going so ballistic, seeing his former lover and another colleague in bed together, seems so asinine.  Especially since he'd already been running slightly amok, using his invisibility to open another colleagues blouse as she slept, and attacking his next door neighbor because he was sexually attracted to her.
 I would also like to know how becoming invisible also turned Sebastian into such a superman.  We see him getting blasted by steam, he's burned bad enough to turn someone into a barbecue, clobbered with a large crowbar, and electrocuted, but like the energizer bunny, he keeps on going.  Ludicrous, how could the makers of this film possibly expect us to buy into this?  Neat special effects can only take you so far, after that you have to have a story worth telling, and this just wasn't it.
 So, my three stars are for the special effects, and I can't justify giving the actual storyline anything, so my review remains at three stars.  Rent or borrow this movie if you can, but I don't advise spending your money to buy it, there's better stuff out there to spend your money on.",984787200,2,1972,4.670520231213873
1320210,2,B00003CXKA,"If one spectacular special effect could make a movie, this one would be great.  The scenes of experimental subjects going from invisible to visible are wonderful, they bring things into being anatomical layer by anatomical layer.  It's a shame that's virtually the only thing worth seeing about this movie.
Kevin Bacon's potentially interesting role as loose cannon scientist was too shallow to keep my interest.  The other characters in the movie are much more impressed with him than the audience should be.  Even the transition he makes from merely egocentric to violently grandiose is largely unconvincing.  It isn't clear
As shallow as his character is, the remaining roles were cartoons compared to him, and the story is simply awful.  For the science fiction minded, there was not the least explanation or development of the ""quantum shifts"" that are supposed to allow invisibility to occur.  For the drama minded, there are lost opportunities galore to allow an invisible man to exploit his situation.  Having him unbutton a woman's blouse is hardly creative use of the potentials in this situation.
If there's an award for a movie making nothing of its great potential, this one would be close to the top.  I hope they use those wonderful effects in another movie that has more of a plot and better developed characters than this one.
I gave this two stars because it is high gloss and visually interesting, and keeps you thinking about how the character might next exploit his situation ... but he never quite does (does sneaking into a woman's apartment and then just outright attacking her count as an interesting way to exploit invisibility ?)",984355200,3,1656,4.992727272727273

Sebastian (played by Bacon) is the principal scientist (and lunatic-at-large) in a vital, underground, top-secret government project to render living beings invisible.
Sebastian is arrogant & immature, with a serious God-complex. He's also a playboy, a foolish risk-taker and an animal abuser. This guy just seems to get off on pain, even his own.
Linda (Elisabeth Shue) is supposedly a gifted scientist as well. But her role is more that of a flirty, contemptuous teenager juggling boyfriends (Bacon-Ex & Brolin-current) & tossing verbal barbs with Bacon.

Bacon's character is so obsessed with sex and power, it's hard to imagine him being able to concentrate long enough on his experiments for them to be even remotely successful.

From sexually assaulting a woman he watches from his apartment to killing people, and copping a feel from his fellow female employees.  Eventually, along with his flesh he loses his mind, and goes on a killing spree. This isn't a great horror film, but it's got great visual effects during the process of invisible to visible and vice versa.  Seeing a giant gorilla reappear and Kevin Bacon disappear are both very graphic and kind of gross but wow! -- whoever created these effects deserves an oscar (The film was nominated for Best Visual effects).  In my opinion, the film doesn't have much else going for it.  The rest of the acting is pretty bad.  Elizabeth Shue needs to either get a new career or at least some acting lessons.  She turned in a very lame performance.  The screenplay wasn't much better.  Rent Hollow Man for a look at it's great effects and it's great lead actor Kevin Bacon.",982195200,,1352,4.477551020408163

Here we have a man who's endowed with such genius that he works for the Federal Government in top secret projects and the only thing the twit can think of doing is getting off sexually, one way or another.  The character of Sebastian is one dimensional, at best and to boot, he's positively loathsome.  His descent from scientist to homicidal maniac is so abrupt that you are left to wonder if you nodded off at some point and missed a chunk of the character's development.  But how could you have missed anything when there is hardly any character to speak of and the development was as methodical and deliberate as flicking on a light switch.  No amount of impressive special effects can save this dog of a movie.  Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin turn in the pedestrian performances of their careers and Kevin Bacon's hammy, over the top bad boy incarnation grew tiresome ten minutes into the movie.  Incidentally, I never knew that being invisible was synonymous with being invincible.  Sebastian turned into the indestructible Michael Myers with surprising ease.  Laughable through and through.  Bad acting, silly plot, predictable screenplay but great special effects.  In other words, typical of the Hollywood pablum factory.",981331200,8,1290,5.037735849056604

Then they get brought back to there regular normal phase. And Then Kevin Bacon decides he wants to try it. Basically Hollow Man is an updated version of The Invisible Man.  Hollow Man was called ""I Know What You Did In the Lab this Summer"" And that is pretty on the dot. Elizabeth Shue plays Kevin Bacons former love, and colleague. Josh Brolin plays Shues current love and colleague. I will have to say that Hollow Man is a little wittier then the completely routine slasher films such as Urban Legends: Final Cut. I'm not sure if it should have been a slasher film, but it turned out to be.  Bacon basically locks everyone in the lab and starts stalking in a high gore fashion, you know the usual impaling and slicing and dicing. To Be honest, I don't  it was intended to be a slasher film, but it turns out to be one. It has some good suspense and is a great deal Scarier than Urban Legends: Final Cut, but that isn't saying much though, since that movie WAS NOT Scary!!.  Hollow Man is a visual feast, and has some much needed wit to it. The ones being stalked are a little smarter than the 'stupid blond running from a mad slasher, even though he is catching up to her, and he is walking' but still make the same stupid mistakes.  Kevin Bacon gets to play a bad guy, instead of a good guy. I sincerely think he should stick to the good guys. It isn't he is bad, it is just a waste of his time., and talent.  Hollywood still hasn't figured out that nothing is scarier than everything. That probably doesn't make since so here is an example 'The Blair Witch Project' was 5 times scarier than Hollow Man and Hollow Man is 3 times scarier than Urban Legend 2. The Blair Witch had no killer, no stalker no witch. The sense on the witch was scarier. And Urban Legend 2 had the stalker, insulting gore, and bad acting.  Since Hollow Man was gory it wasn't to scary, but it did get a better review from me because there were times you couldn't see anything you only could sense the trouble, and that is a good thing.",981331200,,2182,4.333333333333333

Pretty soon he goes a little bit more crazy and traps the other scientest inside the lab and begins to kill them off one by one.  Ok, the one thing I can honestly say is I tried HARD to enjoy The Hollow Man, I thought it had a great idea and the effects where amazing but the effects are probably one of the only things good in the movie.  The movie gets very boring very fast. It takes at least a good hour before something finally happens and when it does happen it is very predictable. You always know where the invisable man is going to come out from, there is really no suprises. Also there is no real gore in this movie either,  the deaths are pretty dull except for one or two and Sabastian seems to be immortal, it's hard to beleive he survives as much as he does.

1320353,2,B00003CXKA,"The two obvious flaws with Hollow Man are the character development and the last half-hour. Major flaws indeed, but flaws that could have easily been repaired. One could easily blame Verhoeven himself, but close inspection of the film reveals several glimmers of potential insight that give one the hope that this is merely another example of High-Budget Hollywood Hijinx. This is one of the films that I long to see the original script for, to see how much on-screen was films execs utilizing their standard High-Budget sci-fi Special-Effects Extravaganza Formula (I find it hard to believe that screenwriters across the country are all convinced that what their big finale really needs is yet another big explosion).
 The movie starts with a glimmer of hope, but the ending devolves into yet another Aliens wanna-be (`My God, we're locked in here with the monster/creature/alien/madman/senator, and there is nowhere to run, therefore we must track down and defeat our slippery foe!') where the cast you've failed to gain any real affection for is slaughtered one by one in unique and interesting ways. It is the ultimate insult, that H. G. Wells' classic sci-fi tale of man's inherent evil has been reborn as an expensive hack & slash horror film. I have nothing against hack & slash, mind you. But there is a time and a place for everything, and this was neither the time nor the place. Not that I'm arguing against the film's depictions of violence, despite that fact that the film degenerates to the point where characters are actually throwing bags of plasma around the room in a cheap attempt to get as much blood as possible without too much MPAA approved violence. On the contrary, the films opening scene alone had a brutality and vividness to it that gave rise to my expectations (which were soon to be dashed against the rocks of a cheesy Hollywood ending). It effectively depicted the danger and foreboding of an unseen aggressor, like an extreme case of ""Fearing the Unknown"".

I've also found people who complained, not that the film was violent, but that it was vulgar. Yes, it seems that Kevin Bacon makes up for his lack of nudity in Stir Of Echoes (The Rev Rates It 8) by showing as much Bacon Behind as possible. In fact, voyeurism becomes (or should have become) a major theme of the film, and not just through the aspect of an invisible man spying unawares. The parallel to the `Peeping Tom' aspect is the growing concern with the other scientists with not only seeing the invisible scientist, but constantly monitoring him as well.

As for main character, in this case he is weak because he leaves little room for dramatic development. Sebastian Caine's descent into madness isn't as much a plummet as it is a hop from the curb. The head scientist is an egomaniacal, manipulative, frustrated workaholic. Gee, lets give the power of invisibility and see if it corrupts him. Instead of giving the film yet another form of Instant Evil (just add unlimited power, and watch your Chia Villain grow!), so much more could have been said about man's nature by corrupting the soul of someone you wouldn't expect to turn on his fellow man. The double-meaning title of the film itself pointed in the proper direction, yet failed to follow. Hollow Man not only referred to the eerie sight of seeing through the eye holes of a mask to the back of the head, or of clothing encompassing nothing as if a hollow shell. It also referred to Sebastian Caine, a `Hollow Man' containing nothing within but shallow desires and relentless hunger for power. While there are moments where this is eluded too, the film goes off on other little diatribes that detract from this, losing its real strength by trying to appear more involved than it allowed itself to be.

In the end Hollow Man became a Hollow Film. It starts off showing the promise of a truly inventive film with a brain as well as a soul, and winds up as nothing more than another schlock sci-fi/thriller effects extravaganza with nothing to say but `Boo' and `Kablam'! And that, dear viewer, is the true horror.",980035200,9,4073,4.78125
1320354,2,B00003CXKA,"This flick (to me) was nothing more than a high-tech re-hash of the 1933 classic Invisible Man that starred Claude Rains and Gloria (Titanic) Stuart. Brilliant scientist finds secret of invisibility, becomes a no-see-um, becomes a murderous madman, and dies at the end. What saved this movie from a one-star rating in my book was the incredible special effects. Unfortunately, Paul Verhoeven has again used flashy SF to cover a very weak plot(Starship Troopers). The characters are nothing to write home about, and after the first 15 minutes, you can pretty much tell who will live and who won't. Liz Shue and Josh Brolin turned out fairly wooden performances, veering between romance and action in a rather clumsy fashion. Kevin Bacon reeked of ""bad dude"" from the get-go, but it seemed that his rampages started too soon, and for a very weak reason. The supporting cast was actually better than the main stars, and you actually felt sorry when they were offed by Bacon in a series of (very painful) methods. But, I must say, the most entertaining feature was when Bacon first became invisible. I think we all have wondered how much fun it would be, although most people would not revert to rape and murder to get their jollies. But, if you want a movie with wonderful SF, laughable characters and predictable plot twists, check this out. It is a good way to spend a wintered-in evening.",979948800,,1388,4.811715481171548

The movie moves at a good clip, while the special effects are nothing short of stunning.  The classic James Whale film, THE INVISIBLE MAN, with Claude Rains in the title role, is still the best flim of this type.  HALLOW MAN, however, does provide a quick paced entertainment.

1320356,5,B00003CXKA,"Contrary to all of this bad press about Hollow Man it's a very short-wave movie about the classical god-complexed scientist, loosing his ingenious but perverted mind in the ecstasy of success. Kevin Bacon, always a must see is like in The River Wild an excelent villain, while Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin are likeable, somewhat clumsy heroes. The movies special effects are breathtaking, yet not to overdone. Paul Verhoevens own style was never better balanced, just the right mixture of Starship Troopers and Basic Instinct. Nothing seems constructed or flat. Last but not least, there is this fantastic Score by Jerry Goldsmith, a haunting combination of Oscar nominated Basic Instinct an prize-winning The Omen. Hollow Man is certainly not the movie to re-write motion-picture-history but a well done, entertaining flick to kill a cold January evening.
The DVD is, as to expect from Columbia a fine produced collecters peace. The bonus material features just the right parts of the movie, like Verhoeven always funny commentary and Goldsmith's thrilling score. Sounds and images are crystal cleare and invisible Sebastian's voice, moving unseen from front to rear and back is truly chilling.
For fans of Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, Paul Verhoeven or Jerry Goldsmith the movie delivers everything to have a lot of fun and as for the critics, I'de like to see a guy like Roger Ebert direct a movie. Paul Verhoeven still knows how to create a solid thriller.
Finally a message from Germany to those guys at Columbia and Warner.

Basically the story goes something like this. Kevin Bacon plays a scientist (of the mad variety!), who discovers the secret of making things invisible. The problem with this is bringing them back visible. When the breakthrough happens, Bacon unofficially experiments on himself. With his new found freedom he slowly starts to lose his grip on reality, and takes things into his own hands, to get what he wants.
Visually the film is stunning, the special effects look superb on DVD's superior quality. The audio is a classic Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, which enables you to hear every little noise like crystal, and every explosion with window shattering clarity.
The special features are required viewing, just to find out how they managed those effects, with plenty of insight, the only drawback is that on the featurettes they seem to share the same interviews.

1320425,3,B00003CXKA,"With all of the buzz that surrounded the release of ""Hollow Man"" before its release on August 4th, it's easy for me to see why so many critics downed this movie as a lame excuse for special effects and violence. If you've seen the trailer, then you probably already know too much of what is going to happen, kind of like the fiasco that occurred with ""Double Jeopardy."" So basically, this is a movie where the viewer is left to decide whether or not it is any good.
Personally, I found it to be quite enjoyable. Sure, it does fall into some of the all-too-familiar horror/thriller clich&eacute;s, and it seems as though the final third could've been carried out in a different way. But if all you're looking for is a simple Friday night movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat in certain intense moments, then it is not a failure.
""Hollow Man"" is the only movie I've ever seen that hosts such a shocking opening scene. A small rat runs into a large cage, where it is lifted by an unseen force and eaten, with vivid detail. We soon learn that this is part of an experiment funded by the Defense Department in order to discover the key to the invisibility of mammals. The animals are merely test subjects under project leader Sebastian Caine, until he discovers the code to reverse the process. He keeps this discovery a secret from the government, telling his partner Linda McKay that he wants to go ahead with the third phase himself, which involves testing it on himself. Despite the risks at stake, she and Matthew Kensington go along with it, and soon, the process goes ahead and Sebastian disappears from human visibility. But when his reversal process proves a failure on humans, his morality begins breaking down, and he settles into a deranged lifestyle of mayhem and murder, willing to stop at nothing to keep his success a secret from everyone.
With all of this in mind, ""Hollow Man"" is not a bad movie. It does contain its share of genuine thrills and scares, while also giving the storyline a sophisticated and intelligent feel in terms of its scientific aspects. The action does keep moving despite a couple of old-fashioned thriller clich&eacute;s, but even then this may provide for a bit of relief. It does seem as though the third act of the film is a bit underachieved. With all the suspense that the movie builds up to, there seems to be so many other approaches the writers could've taken, but hey: this is a summer thriller movie, so it fits nicely into its genre.
The special effects used for this movie are nothing short of amazing. What makes this movie all-the-more believable is that Kevin Bacon, playing Sebastian, is able to play opposite the other actors, even in the invisibility scenes. Special make-up techniques and computer animation and recreation make each completed shot seamless and simply stunning, and it does have to be said: this is one of the best special effects movies ever made.
Actors also do a great job, and know what they are doing with their characters. Kevin Bacon is quite the evading psycho killer as Sebastian, and just the sound of his voice will send chills up your spine in the most intense moments. Elizabeth Shue is, as always, astounding in her role of Linda McKay, and when the action begins to mount, she is always on hand to keep it moving at twice the speed. She is also able to make audiences believe in her character's intelligence and ability as a scientist. Josh Brolin does a good job as the hero-for-a-day character Matthew, and despite his character's all-too-familiar entrances to save the day, he plays them all so well, like the idea is totally brand new.
To sum it up, ""Hollow Man"" is a good movie. Not great; just good. It has the suspense, the thrills, and the action needed to make it a plausible thriller, though those looking for more substance will be at a bit of a loss. It can be smart and intelligent at times, while giving its audiences a simple story that is easy to follow and quite enjoyable.",979430400,,3990,4.613220815752461

The story is slow, predictable, and has ALOT of holes.  However, the acting is rather good, considering that the actors had very little to work with in the script.  Also, the visual effects alone make this movie worth seeing, they are amazing and definately among the best ever.
I noticed something while watching this.  Jerry Goldsmith ripped himself off when writing the musical score for the movie.  The main musical theme is an obvious doctored version of the score from ""The Haunting"", which Goldsmith conducted in 1999.
The DVD features are also good, especially the 5 mini-making-of featurettes, detailing how certain visual effects were accomplished.
This is a must-have for any DVD collector, however, for the rest of us, we would be better off making it a Blockbuster night, because, since the visual effects are the only thing that make this movie good, it's not really worth seeing more than once.",979344000,,990,4.910179640718563
1320427,2,B00003CXKA,"Well, I agree that this movie wasn't all that fantastic.  It was pretty predictable and I didn't like Kevin Bacon in this movie.  I liked it when he became invisible, because I wouldn't have to see him anymore.  I first saw a preview for this movie at the theater. I really didn't think I would be interested in this movie, but I did notice one scene in the preview that was promising. It was Rhona Mitra in a robe, just after stepping out of the shower.  So, based on that, I watched the movie.
As I said earlier, it wasn't very good, but I did like getting to see Rhona.  She hasn't had very many roles and I was a bit dissappointed that she had no lines.  Anyway, Rhona was absolutely beautiful.  You gotta love brunettes with dark brown eyes.  This is one of the parts of the movie where there is nudity.  This film should not be viewed by younger viewers. Rhona is shown topless, much to my delight, but this scene gets sinister rather quickly.  This is another reason why I hated Kevin Bacon in this movie.  It really made me mad to think about what he was going to do to her.  Fortunately, the VHS version (which I saw) cuts away as he attacks her.  I couldn't wait to see Kevin Bacon get killed after that.  Unfortunately, it takes awhile to finally get rid of him.
So, if your a big fan of Rhona Mitra, you may wanna buy this movie just to see her, but fast forward through the last part of her scene.  As for everyone else who just wants to see a thrilling movie, I would advise you to rent it at the local video store and not buy it.",979344000,2,1544,4.168918918918919

The only point where the willful suspension of disbelief really got the whammy was how stupid these genius' behaved at times.

Really enjoyed the invisible gorilla and dog, and thought any climax would be anti-climactic, but not so -- although predictable, it is very exciting and I have ordered my copy from .... and so, months later, I still find this movie fun--often watch it in bits and pieces I like.  Even have the Superbit version as well!",978912000,3,959,4.644970414201183
1320515,3,B00003CXKA,"This is an utterly unoriginal update of H.G. Wells ""Invisible Man"", which was first made into a movie in 1933.  In that story, a scientist invents a formula to make beings invisible and after taking it himself, he goes mad and goes on a killing spree.  This film doesn't vary much from that formula except, unfortunately, the presentation is as unintelligent as that of a low budget slasher film.
Invisibility is a premise that is fertile with possibilities.  It could have taken any number of directions other than a hack movie.  Writers Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew Marlowe venture into voyeurism and molestation and stop just short of rape, which could have been an interesting main theme for a detective story.  Instead, they use it only as an appetizer and then default to the unimaginative.  Another possibility would have been to use the advantage of invisibility to steal money or top-secret information to accumulate power.  However, why waste time writing an original script when you can trot out yet another production line monster?  In the typical B horror movie tradition, the truculent Dr. Caine (Kevin Bacon) is ""killed"" at least four times, each by means no human being could survive.
Director Paul Verhoven has long been associated with sci-fi thrillers (Robo Cop, Total Recall, Starship Troopers).  What they all seem to have in common is good special effects and weak stories.  I don't know whether this is bad judgment on Verhoven's part in selecting projects or poor presentation; probably it's a bit of each.
If there is one area where this film is superlative, it is visual effects.  The transformation to and from invisibility is fantastic, almost a lesson in anatomy as the various organs of the body are peeled away a layer at a time.  The incorporation of this effect with an actor writhing against restraints on the operating table is astonishing.  In addition, the renderings of the form of the invisible man seen by various means are astounding.  He produces one silhouette while under water, another when sprayed with a fire extinguisher and still another when seen with infrared glasses.  These effects alone are worth suffering through this clunker.
Kevin Bacon gives a good performance as the maniac.  He is extremely believable in malevolent roles.  The DVD has a featurette that shows how some of the effects were done.  They required Bacon to wear head-to-toe blue, green and black body suits for various effects, many of which took hours to apply and were uncomfortable to wear.  I have to give him credit for still being able to act while trussed up this way.  Elizabeth Shue is wrong for this role.  She does well in sexy roles, lovable roles and sometimes even intelligent roles, but she is definitely not suited for action roles.  Josh Brolin give a credible performance as Caine's rival.
This film is a bundle of wasted potential.  I rated it a 6/10, a kindness bestowed in honor of vanguard visual effects.  Lovers of mindless gore add two points.  It's worth seeing for the visuals if you can stomach a variation on ""Friday the Thirteenth"" in the last 30 minutes.",978912000,5,3110,4.90057361376673
1320516,2,B00003CXKA,"I really do like most of Kevin Bacon's movies-but not this time. The ""science"" is insipid-his invisible eyelids can't block the light, but his invisible retina can form an image from his invisible iris.  And duct tape is put to marvelous use in this movie as well-enabling a man who has a hole punched in his abdomen by a crowbar to hang from a ladder by one arm while holding his girlfriend with the other.  It's also hard to see why Kevin Bacons character becomes nearly invincible once he becomes invisible.  The acting if okay in this movie--it's the writers who failed miserably. Ths movie also has several scenes which seem to be there merely to appeal to deviants. I borrowed this dvd to watch it-and I still felt ripped off!",978825600,,732,4.572519083969466
1320517,2,B00003CXKA,"What would you do if you knew you could do anything you wanted to utterly secure in the knowledge that there could be no eyewitness to your actions?  Or, stated in more universal terms, are we humans really innately good and moral beings, concerned with the well being of the fellow members of our species?  Or are we merely held back from acting out our base primal urges for evil and destruction through fear of detection and punishment?  This intriguing premise serves as the basis for ""Hollow Man,"" a sci-fi thriller that, initially at least, toys with some of these deeper themes yet, like so many big budget action films, ultimately yields to incredibility, preposterousness, and over-the-top sensationalism.
A movie like ""Hollow Man"" provides a rather unique opportunity for a lead actor - in this case, Kevin Bacon - in that he probably only appears on screen for about a third of the duration of the film.  It is probably the skimpiest lead role in movie history, since most of the rest of the time he merely needs to contribute voice over assistance or appear behind a hollowed out rubber mask.
Credit the filmmakers with at least having the courage to present a rather desipicable character as their protagonist.  Yet, even in its initial stages, when it appears as if it might actually explore the more metaphorical aspects of the title and examine the hollowness within the central figure himself, the film still suffers from both credibility gaps and lapses in logic.  We are supposed to believe, for instance, that the Pentagon would be willing to fund this ragtag collection of babes and hunks masquerading as serious scientists in their research into invisibility - though the purpose for the Pentagon's interest in the experiment is never adequately explained to us.  None of the researchers seem as if they will be pushing middle age anytime soon and Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine, is particularly unconvincing as the ""genius"" he is purported to be since he never utters a single observation whose profundity would challenge the average junior high school student teetering on the verge of puberty.  In fact, Caine, when he isn't trumpeting his own accomplishments to a rather unappreciative world, can be found peering lustfully through the blinds at the very sexy neighbor across the alley.  This tendency towards voyeurism sets the character up for some profound possibilities once he himself turns invisible, yet after a few halfhearted thrusts in that direction, the filmmakers end up locking all the characters into the laboratory while a by-now-crazed Caine attempts to knock them all off one by one.  This is where the movie really falls apart.  The filmmakers - writers Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe along with the normally gifted director Paul Verhoeven - lose all control of the potentially intriguing themes they have hitherto set up and spend the last hour or so piling on one action movie clich and character inanity after another.  Why make a movie about an invisible man if you don't intend to do anything interesting with it?  By the end, ""Hollow Man"" begins to feel like just the latest variant on the ""Alien"" movies, ""Deep Blue Sea,"" ""The Thing"" and countless other films wherein a group of people are trapped and being hunted by a force with superior powers.
Another flaw:  how is Caine, in his invisible state, able to move around so soundlessly?  People do make noise when they move and it seems unlikely that Caine's presence would really be all that hard to detect.
Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens and others in the cast aren't given much of an opportunity to exercise their acting muscles - and, unlike Bacon, they are not afforded the option of blanking themselves into invisibility for the duration.  Considering the results on screen, Bacon just might be a genius after all!
A special note:  while I was viewing this film at home, someone knocked on my front door - and, guess what, there was no one there!  Spooky!",978825600,3,3988,4.918032786885246
1320518,4,B00003CXKA,"As someone who appreciates good special effects, I thought this movie was very enjoyable.  The story introduces no new twists and little innovation to the standard action/horror genre (much of the action was predictable), yet nevertheless the effects were good enough to keep me engrossed in the film.
The second audio channel on the DVD is certainly worth listening to after you've watched Hollow Man once through. Verhoeven, Bacon, and Marlowe relate good stories about the process of creating the effects, and I was just as engrossed watching the movie the second time around with the commentary on as I was the first time around.  I've found such commentary on DVDs to be of random value; perhaps because I was so interested in the effects, the commentary accompanying Hollow Man was especially helpful.
If you like good effects and can look past the fact that Bacon plays a dark character who uses his invisibility for some pretty perverse purposes, you'll like this DVD.",978739200,2,976,4.9815950920245395

First of all the effects were great, and after seeing the making of the movie on the DVD edition....it was amazing how much went into them.  OK...the plot COULD have been more involved, but I think most folks are missing the point.  IF there was a way to become invisible....what would YOU do???  Would you use it to your advantage, for immoral purposes, or use it strictly for science???  This issue was touched upon in the movie, but most didn't catch it.  The acting was all around ok, with good casting.  The scientific premise was pretty hokie, but then no one has ever become invisible, so there was no basis for it.  Because Kevin Bacon was actually ON the set in the scenes (in a green suit) the actors could ACT toward a real human not just the camera and it made that aspect more realistic.  If you are into the original ""Invisible Man"", then you will probably like the twist they put on it.  There is plenty of action and great effects....but if it's a deep plot, and superb acting that you want, then try the ""Patriot"".",978739200,,1130,4.441747572815534
1320520,1,B00003CXKA,"While I have enjoyed some of Verhoeven's films (Starship Troopers, Robocop), I did not think much of this one.  The dialogue is juvenile; a certain four-letter word seems to be in every sentence.  I am not a member of the Moral Majority, but I do get the feeling that scriptwriters are lacking in ability when they must resort to cursing overkill.
The plot has some obvious holes in it, which more or less blow the film out of the water.  The Brolin character gets skewered by a crowbar, then reappears full-strength as if nothing had happened.  Kevin Bacon is turned into a crispy critter-literally burned with a blowtorch, but still has energy to create mayhem for the film's finale.  Gaffes such as these are an insult to any filmgoer's intelligence.
The CGI is superb, but is not worth much without good dialogue and a sensible plot to back it up.  Too bad; all looks with no substance. Frankly, this director has done, and is capable of, much better than this.  Back to the drawing board, Paul.",978739200,3,999,4.642045454545454

Besides the extensively long, boring intro...and the slow development of the plot, which couldn't have been more than five sentences long, this movie was ultimately predictable. There was maybe one twist.
However, if you are a fan of Kevin Bacon or any other actors/actresses in this film, I have some good things to say about this film. the acting is not bad. I won't say that it was good, but I won't say that it was bad. Second, the special effects in this movie are very good, actually I'd say that they were excellent.
This does not mean that I recommend the film. Because sadly, it lacked plot and it lacked interest. the movie was not going anywhere, and I knew what was going to happen in the end, I was just waiting for it to happen.",978652800,,876,4.41358024691358
1320522,1,B00003CXKA,"Somewhere, buried deep within its watered down blood and thunder, is a fine science fiction/horror thriller, too bad the screenwriters and director could not see the forest for the trees.
Kevin Bacon does a fine job with his ego driven charcter, you can see him straining to make this guy seem real, but the script gives him very little to work with. Elizabeth Shue's performace is so lifeless that, if I had not seen her in Leaving Las Vegas, I would think she could not act....Josh Brolin is the heroic boyfriend and he fills in the space nicely but does little else. The rest of the cast is simply cannon fodder that will, in the final reels, die in various special effects ladden ways, no surprises there.
Jerry Goldmsith once again graces a mediocre movie with a superlative score. If Hollow Man had been slightly more watchable I would have taken the time to listen to the isolated track containing the score and a Goldsmith commmentary, but I'll just get the soundtrack instead. The movie is simply too painful to sit through again.
I could go on and on about all the logic and character snafus, but why bother. There are far better things to do with my time.",978652800,3,1166,4.583732057416268
1320582,2,B00003CXKA,"I wanted to like this movie.  The invisibility concept was well-thought, using a quantum phase shift to put an object out of phase thus rendering it invisible, even if the physics of achieving it through an irradiated serum was not.  The special effects were beautiful.  Beyond that, the movie offers nothing worthwhile in the way of entertainment.  It is rather slow and we are not given any reason to like any of the characters.  Even though Kevin Bacon's mad scientist roll was depicted as arrogant and unlikeable long before invisibility drove him to insanity and evil, he was the only character who evoked any sort of empathy.
The DVD has many interesting extras.  The anamorphic transfer was flawless and the digital audio track was very well done.  There was a part in the movie that had me looking behind me for a housefly that wasn't there.  Deleted scenes were included, along with a nonoptional commentary about them.  Behind-the-scenes featurettes were interesting and presented well.  All in all, the DVD packaging is excellent.",978652800,3,1041,5.0
1320583,3,B00003CXKA,"OH THE POSSIBILITIES WERE ENDLESS.....The concept of this movie had me drueling with anticipation.  A modern day invisible man film directed by Verhoeven has all the ingredients to make one great flick. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype that I had set.
Kevin Bacon leads a team of government researches (Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin and others) trying to obtain chemistry's holy grail....an invisibility serum.  A working prototype has given them success with other primates, but the possibility of an invisible man remains out of their grasps.  Bacon plays a mad genius type. Combine that with the fact that the serum leads to increased aggression and the plot is as see through as the hollow man himself.
Due credit goes to the special effects crew. The changing sequences were masterful and fluid.  Suspense was made possible with ingenious hints as to the hollow man's presence.  The movie is worth seeing and buying for the visual aspects alone.  However, the letdown is with plot aspects.  Yes there are some moments where Bacon uses his invisibility for diabolical means, but overall the film doesnt explore the age old axium of just how  much good natured mischief you could have if noone could see you.

If you know anything, for instance: Gorillas are vegetarians; Setting a man on fire, then braining him with a crowbar then electrocuting him would kill him; you won't enjoy this movie nearly as much as if you dropped out of school at age nine.  Don't get me wrong. The performances are fine, the camera moves assuredly and the film is essentially a guidebook for editors of action films. Unfortunately, nothing in this film happens for a reason, only to set up some kind of special effects shot. The script is the culprit here; the film could have served the effects and the story, but it chose to ignore everything but the most simple plot elements.  The extras on this DVD are above average. They focus mainly on the special visual effects. If you are interested in green screen effects and how long they take to set up and shoot, you'll love this disc.

It has Kevin Bacon (which is one of the reasons Stir of Echos is in my top 5 favorite movies). When the reviews came out...my enthusiasm dwindled.  But I gave it a chance and Hollow Man turned out better than expected.  It has science but not enough, I was left wondering how the heck ""quantum phase shifting"" was appiled to the human body, last time I heard of QPS I was watching Star Trek NG! The movie does explain things somesort but not enough.  Elizabeth Shue does a great job of playing the mad scientist's (Bacon) love interest.  All the actors do reasonable jobs of playing their parts.  The ending was a surprisingly simple though.  While watching I couldn't help but compare Hollow Man to ""The Fly"" with Jeff Goldbloom. I mean you have the mad scientist that has to test his amazing invention on himself and he ends up going crazy and kills a few people. The primise is the same, but its a good change from all the other ""invisible man"" movies. The sound and visuals are amazing but the DVD is lacking in special features.

This is a major disappointment citing that this is one reason we buy dvds, but also with a film that was as trashed as Hollow Man by critics, it would be best to include as much as possible to make ones already unsure about the movie want to buy the dvd.

1320669,4,B00003CXKA,"Paul Verhoeven's latest thriller, Hallow Man delivers heart-stopping action, great thrills, and terrific special effects scenes losely tied together by poor transition scenes.  The movie focusses on a genius played by Kevin Bacon.  It seems the government wants to create a serum that can turn people invisible.  Headed by Bacon, a group of scientists, including the ever beautiful Elizabeth Shue, work in a secret government underground research facility-how many times in movies are secret government research facilities underground anyway? Uncle Sam has some pretty poor real estate brokers.  Anyway, these scientists have been able to make animals invisible-a very impressive scene includes a gorrilla becoming visible litterally from the inside out.  The scientists are positive that the serum is ready for humans, but Bacon does not want to just hand it over to the government just yet.  The scientists use the serum on Bacon, and after yet another impressive scene, he becomes invisible.  The only problem, the antidote does not seem to work on humans.  Bacon remains invisible for days and his dark side emerges.  It seems that hollywood must pump out an invisible man movie every now and then, if for no other reason than to brag about the latest special effects.  The last invisible man movie-John Carpenter's Memoirs of an Invisible Man had stunning special effects for its day.  Now its time to update the effects with the latest in digital abilities.  And this movie delivers these effects brilliantly.  There are a number of things that the invisible man is covered with in this movie that are pretty neat to watch.  This movie also touches on something that some invisilbe man movies do not-how tempting would it be to do wrong if you were invisible?  Invisibility is the perfect symbol for absolute immunity-no matter what you do, you cannot be caught.  This tradition stretches back thousands of years to ancient Greece when Plato spoke of the myth of Gynges.  In short, a poor shephard finds a ring inside a hollowed bronze statue of a horse.  He discovers that this ring can make him invisible.  To make a long story short, he turns evil and manages to-have an affair with the queen, kill the king, marry the queen and declare himself the new ruler.  This movie touches on that thought.  Without going into detail, let's just say that Bacon gets into some mischeif, and some all out wrongdoing, durring his days of invisibility.  All in all, it seems as though this movie has everything going for it-a good cast, a great director, great special effects, and an interesting idea.  The problem is that this interesting idea for a story does not mature itself into a great movie. While the characters seem both real and believable, I have trouble swallowing Bacon's decent into hell.  I believe that being invisible would deffinitely have it's temptations.  But Bacon goes from an arrogant, yet light-hearted genius to a full blown physco in only a few days time.  Of course, this transformation is sped up by a revelation of Bacon's about Elizabeth Shue's character.  I'm not going to say what but here's a hint-they used to be an item, he still wants her, but she's moved on.  I'll buy that this would fuel his decent, but it still feels too rushed.  Perhaps this shows a disadvantage to Bacon's invisibility-he goes through this terribile transformation of the soul, but we the audience are unable to wittness it.  Once invisible, the only performance of Bacon's the audience gets is a voice and the occasional invisible effect-Bacon covered in blood, steam, water, and fire.  The production team obviously spent a long time planning the invisible effects shots, they should have spent even more time planning on slowing and showing Bacon's decent and making it more blievable.  Verhoeven is usually very good at showing decents into madness and the darkness of the human soul,they are always dominant issues in his movies, but his movies focus on the actors' facial reations to situations, but with Bacon being invisible, Verhoeven cannot rely on this technique.  All in all this was a good movie. When all the aspects of the movie are averaged, the movie earns a repsectable B, maybe even a B+.  A for effects, B for acting, C for plot, A for surprises.  But, despite what hollywood might say to the contrary with big block buster special effects movies, special effects don't make a great movie, just great eye candy.  A great plot, a great script, and great acting make a great movie.  Godzilla, though it had great effects, sucked because the plot was weak.  Independence Day rocked, not because the effects were breathtaking, but because the plot did not isult the audience's intelligence while showing off alien attack scenes.  My personal favorite movie of all time, Dragonheart, had terrific effects which complemented, not overshadowed, the plot-which was an excellent plot and I highly recommend Dragonheart to all who read this.  If you like thrillers, sci-fi movies, or special effects movies, this is a good one for you.  It has it's moments, but many of these focus too heavily on special effects.

The effects are astounding, the acting was good, and it shows what would really happen if one would be invisible. I agree the effects was stronger then the story quality, but that was the intention. And Kevin Bacon made his presence known even if we couldn't see him. I think people today are getting too demanding on movies like snobby art critics are today. This Movie was a piece of Paul Verhoeven's creativity. It made good use out of an old concept that dates back to Plato. 4 stars from me. And if people wish to get a movie that has shock, kick, eye candy, some humour, and gore. Hollow Man is a must. I believe people should relax with their nit pickiness, and try not to make sense out of a movie that is not supposed to make sense, it's not real, wasn;t meant to be, that's why it's Sci-Fi. Relax, lay back, and free your mind of all common REAL life thoughts, and enjoy an action packed, visually stunning extraveganza with Hollow Man.",975888000,16,1083,4.366336633663367

1320674,1,B00003CXKA,"When I began watching this movie I didn't expect much.  And through the beginning of it, I actually kind of liked it.  Mainly it was due to the great special effects.  It was interesting to watch an ape/gorilla reappear from nothingness.  And it was also neat to watch Kevin Bacon dissapear.  But after that, the movie goes from bad to worst to just plain stupid.  The story was lame and the dialouge (what little there was) seemed forced.  I like Kevin Bacon quite a bit.  And I think he can play a bad guy pretty well, but in this roll he isn't even there, literally.  I don't really know what this movie was trying to accomplish, but it sure didn't live up to it's expectations.",975369600,,681,4.384

It's true that the special effects are great, but the movie itself, well, just plain isn't.  I really didn't even like it, though usually I can enjoy some B flicks this one was a tad too stupid.  Yeah sure, it had some really funny cheesy scenes but thats the only redeeming quality and then some people don't even enjoy cheeseball humor.  This movies about a scientist doing some really idiotic experiment on himself which turns him invisible.  Then he abuses his supernatural powers and does some naughty stuff with it.  That's it, that's the entire plot.  If you're looking for a GOOD B MOVIE, look no further than Evil Dead 2.  That one you'll have a blast watching.",975024000,,811,4.506849315068493
1320676,3,B00003CXKA,"At the risk of raising the disgust level of one of my Favorite People whose review of HOLLOW MAN also appears, I must beg to differ - but only by a little. I would award 3 stars, not 2.
OK, the Kevin Bacon character is one despicable sicko, totally undeserving of any viewer sympathy. But then, I can't recall any Bacon character in any movie I've seen as being particularly likable - even when he played a Good Guy. He always seems badly in need of an attitude adjustment.  Moreover, even more ridiculous than the improbabilities that my friend from Riga so succinctly pointed out was the scene where bags of blood, otherwise meant for transfusion, were ripped open and the contents splashed on the floor as an early warning system, so to speak. I work for a company that manufactures such bags and, trust me, one can't just tear apart the RF body welds on those like packages of trail mix. However ...
I never dissected a great ape in biology class, but I have attended a couple of human autopsies, so I'm not completely unaware of what's below the skin. The scene where the ape's innards were brought back to visibility was exquisitely done. Not because of what was shown, but how it was done - the sequential appearance of the various tissues, starting from the circulatory system, then the skeleton, nerves, muscles and skin. And the washbasin scene where water took on the outline of an invisible face was way clever. Fine, I'm a sucker for the special effects, but let's give the techno-wizards of Tinseltown the honor that is due. They don't do wonders like that just anywhere in the world.
Finally, I doubt if there's a human alive that, at some point in life, has not wished for the gift of invisibility. As a boy, I envisioned all kinds of mischief under those circumstances. Unfortunately, being invisible, as HOLLOW MAN depicts, necessitates being starkers. That could be a frosty experience on a cold night, whether in Los Angeles or Riga. And imagine getting unstuck from the vinyl booth in a Denny's!",974937600,,2016,4.662921348314606
1320677,2,B00003CXKA,"Well, first of all I'm glad that number of negative and even derivative reviews of this movie is growing: fortunately, there is someone not blinded by sfx (probably those who've properly studied human anatomy at school and are not surprised by display of a guerilla insides) and repulsed by mindless violence of the movie and its main hero, played by K Bacon who seems to have fun and attributing his invisibility to scaring kids, raping women, wringing dogs' and his co-workers' necks and otherwise developing his voyeuristic habits. No sane person can feel any compassion to this haughty freak bathing in his own malevolent genius. His colleagues do not fit together and killed one by one. The final scene is completely improbable (a man burned to the state you can see his tendons and muscles flaying can't chase his colleagues - who have surprisingly good alpinist skills - through elevator shaft).

The plot of this sad effort is moronic--why any of the characters do what they do is inexplicable, and why they don't use their heads and *think* about what to do is ONLY because the writers and director didn't CARE enough to come up with a plot.  I mean, seriously, you are smart enough to be working on a top secret research project with major government funds, but when your boss turns into an invisible homicidal maniac, it doesn't occur to you to always wear the special glasses which allow you to see him?  This kind of inanity pervades the movie.  And why this bothered me so much, I'm not quite sure--but when they make a latex mask for Kevin Bacon, they don't bother to cut holes in it for his nostrils!  If you've ever worn a diving mask, you'd know how humid and uncomfortable that would be within seconds.  In fact, I've had my face cast, and they put straws in my nose so that I could BREATHE DURING THE PROCEDURE!  So there were holes in the mask from the very beginning.  It's this carelessness that drives me to distraction--if you are going to put millions of dollars into a film, why not really THINK about it, instead of insulting our intelligence?  Believe me, it is not worth missing 112 minutes of your life, and whatever this costs you financially, to see the few minutes of special effects that are the only redeeming quality to this film.

I thought, and still think, that was b.s. - King writes many horror novels, which isn't the sub genre known as 'mainstream fiction', but a different sub genre, no better or worse for that.
And yet, here I am, telling you that HOLLOW MAN is a good Bad Movie.  There really is no way to say HOLLOW MAN is a good movie - the plot is cliche, the characters wouldn't, the twists predictable, etc.  Expectedly from a Bad movie, the special effects are really impressive, and this IS the point.
HOLLOW MAN is a Bad movie, but a good Bad movie.  It's stupid, but entertaining.  The characters are cliches, but fun.  The story is obvious and stolen from a million other places(you got your stock 'scientists in a close enviorment', a McGuiver scene, and an ending in an elevator shaft - ooh, originality), but well directed.  The characters are really jokes (The Crazy brilliant scientist, the nerd and less brilliant other, the beautiful action woman tore between them), but they are entertaining.

Obviously these new cool special effects came out then they had to write a story to go along with that. That's what usually drives most Sci-Fi, Horror or disaster movies to be made. There isn't a lot to say about the story. A guy goes mad after the effects of a new invisibility drug goes a little haywire. This is pretty much another slasher movie.

He looks at a woman getting changed, goes back to the lab and stays there. This is the most unexciting movie I've seen in a long time.

1320711,1,B00003CXKA,"I work in a high security lab, so this movie was particularly insulting to me.  The people really working on the bleeding edge of scientific research are all brilliant and insightful.  This movie makes them look like they are completely lacking in the common sense department.  There are so many things about the movie props that bothered me, from the unsecured cordless phones they used in the lab, to the impractical use of an environmentally controlled ""junk"" closet, with a secure locking mechanism that could only be opened from the outside.
It's also frustrating to watch.  So many times I thought to myself, ""why don't you just keep those damned glasses on!"" and ""just set off the fire alarm/sprinkler system to alert the guard!"" and ""the network still works, just email for help!"" and ""just turn off all the lights in the lab, so he can't see you either!"".  The idiocy of the main characters had me constantly throwing my arms in the air or placing my hands over my eyes while shaking my head in disbelief.  It would have been passable as a slasher flick if they had spent even a minimal amount of screen-time at character development, and I've never seen Elizabeth Shue look so ugly in a film.  Animal enthuasiasts will not be happy at the way most of the characters treat the animals... especially the fact that the remaining few die in the explosion near the end.  The cool special effects were worth the price of admission, but I don't think I could bear to watch this movie a second time.

I would have to say that the  special effects were great and it had good conflict. But i think that it was  a very predictable movie that you knew how the movie was going to turn out  the first thirty minutes of the movie. I also think that at the end of the  movie we all knew that after he was ""supposedly"" dead he was  going to get back up and try to kill the people one last time before the  building was gonna blow up.
In all though, I did like the scenes and the  reality of it all because we all know that we aren't to far from those  scientific experiments being created and tested right now, and if u really  think about it its kind of scary to actually think that there could be  somthing like that waiting for you.

1320810,5,B00003CXKA,"Paul Verhoeven likes to shock his audience. I'm Dutch so I have also seen his movies which he made in Holland before he went to America. One of his  movies, ""Turks Fruit"", based upon the book of Jan Wolkers is  considered to be the best Dutch movie ever made. And that movie has so much  sex that it will never be released in America.
When Paul went to America,  he shocked whole America with ""Basic Instinct"" because he doesn't  has a problem with showing sex and nudity in a movie like a lot of American  directors do. I think he realised with ""Showgirls"" that he had  gone to far and shouldn't show that much of nudity but you can still see it  in every movie of him, like the shower-scene in ""Starship  Troopers"".
And now, ""Hollow Man"" has it too, but not that  much. It is as much as you saw in ""Starship Troopers"".
""Hollow Man"" is, just like ""Starship Troopers"",  fantastic to see. And not only because of the fantastic Special Effects but  also because Paul's style which I realy love. OK, in a way is the story not  very original (scientist experiments on hisself and finaly gets insane and  kills people) but on the other hand it is a thing that is very realistic.
I mean, I think that it isn't that hard to believe that when you are  invisible and can't get visible again so you have the fear to probably stay  invisible for the rest of your life and then discovers that your  ex-girlfriend is having an affair with his friend AND is destroing your  career (because that's the way how Sebastian Cane sees it), wouldn't that  drive you crazy? And, okay, Sebastian was kind of f**ked up from the start  of the movie so the fact that nobody can see him and punish him was enough  reason to kill somebody. And ones he killed one, he is just like a dog who  ones he tasted blood, he can't get enough of it.
So don't say that it is  all very unbelievable, because the psychological part of the movie  isn't.

1320815,3,B00003CXKA,"This movie is an attempt to bring the invisible man to the year 2000, it is a very good effort.  As a fan of the genera I saw many elements that  have been respected, Paul Verhoven the director did a very good job, with  some exceptions, but to me these exceptions are unacceptable for a director  of his caliber. If you have not seen the movie don't continue to read as I  may spoil some of the fun.
I liked most of the story, a little shallow  but it's a sort of a remake of  the invisible man,  a simple story. I had  trouble with the ending and I don't understand why directors and producers  feel the need to insult the audience intelligence.
First, Elizabeth Shue  takes a tank of some sort of gas and gerri rigs it as a flame thrower and  burns Kevin bacon to a crisp, his skin chars  and the burned skin start to  fall making him invisible again. I know that when I burn Myself with a  match it hurts!,  In this movie it does nothing more to him than slow him  down for a couple of seconds and then he continues his assault.
Two: he  gets electrocuted by accidentally hitting with a crowbar an electric box  and having the fire extinguishers fill the hall with water. The electric  box looked very powerful like high voltage powerful but this does nothing  more than knock him out for a minute. Remember he has now been killed and  burned twice, but this boy doesn't care, he keeps on going (also the  director doesn't care), a minute later he's climbing the elevator shaft and  fighting with Elizabeth Shue, he falls into the elevator shaft which is  full of fire to be burned for the 3rd last time, I hope he died, but I'm  afraid he might come back for a sequel to be burned a few more times.

1320816,3,B00003CXKA,"Throughout much of ""Hollow Man"", I was reminded of Christopher Marlowe's ""Doctor Faustus"", in which the eponymous character  sells his soul to Mephistopholes, only to turn invisible and play practical  jokes on his unsuspecting contemporaries.
 In ""Hollow Man"",  Sebastian Cole (Kevin Bacon) sells his soul to...well, himself...and uses  his newfound power to play practical jokes on his coworkers, albeit  practical jokes of a slightly evil nature.  Instead of robbing a bank, he  tweaks the nipples of the project veterinarian.  Rather than murder Saddam  Hussein, he rapes the woman in the apartment across the hall.  Like Doctor  Faustus before him Cole is as limited in imagination as he is powerful.  This is a profound statement about human greed, in my opinion, but that's  not really what this review is about.
 At first visually and  Technologically stunning, ""Hollow Man"" bogs down with what I  think of as ""3D Syndrome"" - Paul Verhoeven, having the ability to  amaze you with the many different ways to make Cole visible spends the  entire film...making Cole visible.  We see him in water, smoke, fog, mist,  blood.  We see his invisible frame coated with burnt flesh.  By the end of  the film, reason is tossed out the window, exchanged for pure eye candy.
 Don't get me wrong.  I like eye-candy.  But like any kind of candy, too  much can make you sick.  In the end I felt myself craving substance, a  statement about the tenuous hold we have on morality, something that made  me feel like I was actually watching a movie instead of viewing images in a  particularly gory art gallery.

Supporting roles are adequately  played, though the talented cast is given little to do.  Kevin Bacon chews  a lot of scenery as Cole, but inexplicably chooses to play him as a jerk  all the way through, so we feel nothing but relief when he gets his  comeuppance.",966556800,2,1864,4.855769230769231

However, as Sebastian's ego  grows, and he becomes crazier, he decides not to wear the plaster, and,  instead, opts for walking around invisible.  This is when he starts doing  stuff to scare the research team, as well as others outside of the lab.  Soon, the team realizes that Sebastian is dangerous, and they proceed to  stop him.

1320869,2,B00003CXKA,"I thought this movie would be something fresh.
Truth of the matter is, though, the only thing this movie had going for it were the effects. But  without an even remotely sensible plot to go with those brilliant effects,  this movie had the same impact (or perhaps less) as that of a Barney The  Purple Dinosaur special.
I don't blame the actors. They can only work  with what's in the script, and the script was horrible. The story was cool,  no doubt, but the screenplay was ludicrous.
What with the constant  underestimation of the enemy, the stupid moves on part of the supporting  characters, and the cheesey dialogue, it didn't add up to much.
The  supporting actors, i.e., Josh Brolin (""The Goonies"",  ""Mimic""), Kim Dickens (""Mercury Rising""), and the  others acted well, even if their parts were really shallow. The only person  I really had a problem with in this movie was Elisabeth Shue.
Elisabeth  Shue is a really good actress. In this film, her character was supposed to  be super-smart, government scientist, cream of the crop, yadda-yadda-yadda.  Yet, what I saw was the most flitzy, ditzy, and air-headed performance of  her career.

I was also looking forward  to it because I liked some of Verhoeven's previous sci-fi outings such as  RoboCop and Total Recall. However, I must say I was disappointed in his  latest flick.  There was so much potential to tell a very moving story. It  could have told of a good man who falls into insanity with a power that he  cannot control. The story would have been his futile attempt to remain  sane.  Instead, there is no character development for the Kevin Bacon  character.  There is nothing to explain why he all of a sudden becomes a  psychopath, thus it is no suprise when he goes on a murderous rampage.  In  the end, it becomes nothing more than a slasher flick with a big  special-effects budget that we are supposed to buy into.
P.S.  The  special effects were cool, but that was about it.",965692800,2,925,4.4431137724550895
1320873,2,B00003CXKA,"Kevin Bacon plays a top Washington D.C. scientist who is working on a top secret project. The group has invented a liquid to inject into living  things to make them invisible. They do with  many different animals. Near  the begining of the movie Bacon's character Sebastian Caine has justed  inveted the liquid to make animlas injected with the other liquid to make  them invisible visible again. They succesfully do the whole routine with a  gorilla. Now Caine wants more. He decides to test it on himself. He becomes  invisible. Many tests are conducted on him and now they cant bring him  baclk because the liquid won't work on him. During the next part of the  movie he goes out into the open world invisible. Scaring ang killing  people. But what made it so bas was that Caine had no motive to do any of  the thigs he did. Like kill his boss and other crew that are on the project  with him. The plot is very good. As well as the awsome special effects. But  its too much of an effort for something that wasn't that great. They story  which is good doesnt go too far and its pretty boring. Dont let your eyes  decieve you on the preview. It isn't that good. Rated R for violence,  language, and nudity.",965692800,10,1207,4.418181818181818
1320874,4,B00003CXKA,"Well lets start off by saying that I was looking forward to seeing this movie. From the first time I saw each trailer. And sure enough I went and  saw it opening day.  Well here is my take on this movie. Here are the  things I really enjoyed about this movie. I thought the special effects  were superb. It really is incredible what todays computers are capable of  creating.  I also liked the whole idea behind it cause it really does  make you think. What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen? So I  thought that it was cool that it makes you think.  Here are the things  that i thought could have been better. First I wish that they would have  explained how they came up with the formula. When the movie starts they  already have it invented and never tell what they did or to come up with  it. Like Jurrasic Park they explained how they brought back the dinosaurs.  I also thought that they should have done more with the characters. You  never really get to know any of them very well, so you don't really know  whether to like them or not.  Overall though this movie still gets 4  stars. Mainly for its special effects. But it is a very entertaining movie  too with plenty of action. I would definetely go see this at the big  screen, cause I think it is better than if you wait for it on rental. I  hope this review was helpful to you.",965520000,,1352,4.203125
1320875,3,B00003CXKA,"The first half of this movie I thought was really good, but then it took an odd twisted turn, which to me seemed very unecessary. The special  effects throughout the movie were just great, particularly the parts where  the gorilla was morphing back into a non-invisible form, that was really  cool. The story ended up turning into a generic suspensful ending, which  really wasn't all that scary, and very pridicable. It gave me the  impression that the writers weren't sure how to end this movie so they just  used something that has been done a million times. I would not suggest to  see this unless you can look past everything and just enjoy the special  effects, cause thats about the only part of this movie that I really liked.",965433600,,734,4.635658914728682
1320876,4,B00003CXKA,"Kevin Bacon and his crew including Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue can make animals seem invisible.  Bacon's character wants to try people next and he  wants to be the first.  All the animals are brought back to normal, but  when Kevin goes HOLLOW, they can't get him back.
 He goes a little crazy  and starts exercising his new ability to scare, sneak a peek at a pretty  lady, and like one TAGLINE says ""it's amazing the things you can do  when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore""

7918365,2,B00003CXKA,"I am not a fan of the horror genre, so take that into account because this movie wants to audit that class but still claim partial credit.
A combination of two familiar kinds of movie: The lab-lead-by-egomaniac-scientist and every forgettable teens-trapped-in-a-house-with-a-crazed-killer.  Everybody awkwardly overplays their too-familiar roles. Elisabeth Shue in particular is pathetically underemployed as the only-smart-when-she's-angry scientist lady who somehow thinks the lab dress code is ""hot date"".  If this were a musical performance, you'd say Kevin Bacon played the entire show too loudly and badly off-key - he's not even slightly believable as a scientist, lab leader, government contractor, lusty voyeur, vengeful ex-lover, or anything else he plays in this movie.
The 3D visual effects look great and I really enjoyed them!
But I wish I'd rented Cabin in the Woods instead.",1503532800,,890,5.634328358208955
