2849185,5,B000QX1SUC,I was looking for this certain video and finally found it. Amazon is great. The video was as promised and fast to ship and receive. Thanks!,1263686400,,139,4.384615384615385
2849186,5,B000QX1SUC,"Highly recommended for those with neck and or back problems.  I work w/a trainer that encorporates ab workouts with the AB Roller.  The video was a replacement for another one I had.  More effective if inhalation and exhalation w/tightening abs are the focus w/the routine.  If low back problems do not do the exercise on the cover.  Use exercise ball, by balancing lower legs on it and doing the motion w/the ball.",1228089600,4,415,4.708333333333333
2849187,4,B000QX1SUC,This is worth having.  I bought mine as a backup to the original VHS cassette I had when I bought the ab roller unit several years ago.  Too bad they don't put these things out on DVD.  Go figure.,1187136000,5,196,3.9743589743589745
2849191,5,B000QX1SUC,change my mind I actually watched this for the first time besides just getting it in the mail and thinking that it was an AB roller + tape but I confess I watch the tape and it was very good thank you,1424736000,,200,3.7857142857142856
2849192,5,B000QX1SUC,I was so happy to be able to purchase my workout video.  When  the original was going bad I was afraid I would not be able to find another one.  I am very pleased with it.,1422748800,,171,3.6944444444444446
2849193,5,B000QX1SUC,"This is absolutely the the best ab worker I've ever had. I bought one in 1994, and gave it away (5) years after, biggest regrets. This time, it's for keeps.",1420761600,,156,4.233333333333333
2849194,1,B000QX1SUC,Buyers beware! This is a misleading ad. It is not an Ab Roller plus a workout tape! It is just a useless VHS tape. I truly feel deceived. Amazon needs to watch such ads.,1420588800,7,169,4.0
2849195,5,B000QX1SUC,Exact replacement.,1405468800,,18,8.5
2849196,3,B000QX1SUC,"I have the same VHS tape at home and ordered this one because mine has become worn from using it so much, I was thinking it wouldn't last much longer. The tape I ordered is not in any better condition than the one I have at home. It's OK and will last till I get it put on DVD.
The tape IS the original one. For some reason, I thought Brenda Dykgraaf made another tape for the ab roller. I never noticed the ""Rock n Roll"" title.",1398816000,2,428,3.9310344827586206
2849197,5,B000QX1SUC,Just what I had before that I lost. Love it! All it takes is a few weeks of easy work!,1385769600,,86,3.35
2849198,5,B000QX1SUC,"When I bought this several years ago, I used it and absolutely fell in love with it. I would really like to get this on DVD. I can't find my VHS tape and I would really like to use it again because of the results I got the first time around.",1385251200,3,241,3.7450980392156863
2849199,5,B000QX1SUC,"I owned this video years ago and absolutely loved it. It helped me tighten my abs after having my son.  I was hoping to have the same results so I ordered it again.  Unfortunately it was defective. The worst part is I'm unable to return it.  The tape was wound too tight inside the video and wouldn't Play or FF.  The VCR just kept ejecting the tape.  My husband tried to manually move it forward very gently and it snapped.  How disappointing.  I usually buy only products shipped directly from Amazon, I've always been leery of private sellers.  Now I know why.",1374969600,,563,4.450980392156863
2849200,5,B000QX1SUC,I have owned the AB roller for over 15 years and was so glad to find the tape on Amazon as the tracking on my original tape had gone bad.  It definitely works but you have to be consistent with it.  Just wish it came in a DVD.,1373500800,2,226,3.6875
2849211,5,B000QX1SUC,been doing this since I was a teenager and it really works and is helpful exercise and it is easy to do,1371686400,,103,3.727272727272727
2849212,5,B000QX1SUC,My husband has warn out 3 of these tapes since the purchase of the ab roller 30 years ago. He's abs always have looked great.,1362528000,,125,4.04
2849213,5,B000QX1SUC,i have been looking for this tape for years since I wore the original one out several years ago. So happy to find it. Thank you so much.  It is the best work out ever for abs!,1362441600,,175,3.72972972972973
2849214,1,B000QX1SUC,FOr the price asked for I mistook this for the actual ab machine. This VHS tape cost and was listed as $34. Who still pays that much for a tape? I woud have thought this was a mistake since there was another one posted for the same tape at $9.,1355356800,3,243,3.88
2849215,5,B000QX1SUC,"I bought this many years ago and have used it off and on for many years to get the BEST ab workout there is.  You absolutely must work up to being able to complete it because it's really HARD to complete unless you're in top form.  But amazingly, it puts no strain on your neck or back (not even lower back.)  I love Brenda's energy and instruction.  Now I'm trying to find a copy on DVD.",1352764800,,388,4.065789473684211
2849216,5,B000QX1SUC,"My parents got the original ab roller and this video at least 15 years ago.  I used it all the time, and it still stands as the best ab workout I've ever had.  I wish this video were on DVD.  I know this looks ridiculous, but these short workouts are amazing.",1330560000,,259,4.03921568627451
2849217,5,B000QX1SUC,"I have had the Ab Roller Plus since it came out.  This is one piece of equipment that is easy to use, if used according to the instructions and it is very effective.  If you position your head on the very edge of the head pad, you will not get any neck strain.  You should be able to just use your finger tips for directing the ab roller (not like in the picture where the model is using her entire arm) - this will focus the energy on the ab muscles.  I can't say enough about the Ab Roller.  On a side note, I have tried another unit similar to the ab roller and it was akward and put strain on my neck.",1326067200,9,605,3.886178861788618
2849218,4,B000QX1SUC,I use this several times a week and I find it helpful in keeping my stomach muscles firm. I used it years ago and lost the tape so was happy to get a replacement.,1309046400,2,162,3.7941176470588234
2849219,4,B000QX1SUC,"I ordered this item my mistake, but the supplier refunded my purchase very gracefully.  Good and honorable company to deal with.  If they have the product you want, I'd buy from them.",1287446400,2,183,4.6875
2849220,5,B000QX1SUC,"I used to use the AB Roller Plus years ago and life got in the way so it got tossed aside then eventually thrown away.  Found it again on line ""Thank God"" - because it is the perfect work out tool.  I have neck and lower back problems so any kind of excersizing besides walking is very difficult, plus it helps me stretch.  This is the perfect workout for the med section - it allows you to get a good workout without using your neck.  And don't let the 15 minutes fool ya - you feel it and it works.  Thanks Ab Roller!",1271980800,5,519,4.0
8197872,5,B000QX1SUC,"This is a new tape, it was perfect! Back exercising again with my an roller.",1522886400,,76,4.133333333333334

8197874,1,B000QX1SUC,poor quality.  Very light and doesn't stay in place during exercises.,1473292800,,69,5.2727272727272725
8197875,5,B000QX1SUC,Just like the original. Wife's back at the ab workout!,1462752000,,54,4.5

8197879,4,B000QX1SUC,I need a CD version! This is a perfect ab workout for me.,1451520000,2,57,3.4615384615384617
8197880,1,B000QX1SUC,I thought I was ordering the ab roller plus the workout video that goes with it  But when I only got the video no ab roller  Beware of the wording and the cost is what you would pay for the ab roller not a video.  I got screwed!!!!!',1446163200,3,233,3.8125
8197881,1,B000QX1SUC,"It wasn't what I had expected, it originally didn't state that it was a video, and it's in VHS form. I had thought it was the ab roller itself",1427760000,3,142,3.9310344827586206
