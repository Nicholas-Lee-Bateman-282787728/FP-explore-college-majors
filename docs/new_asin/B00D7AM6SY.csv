8590329,4,B00D7AM6SY,"Of the questions asked on this page's description, one never really gets answered: is the site of this stupa also where the Buddha was born, in Kapilavastu? Even without that answer, however, this is an hour well-spent for anyone fascinated, as I am, with what we can discover of the Buddha's history. I am left with as many questions as I had before, though different ones: what happened to the bones and ashes (are they in Thailand? is anything being done with them?) and is there more being done to investigate this site?

Along the way, historian Charles Allen takes us on location to several sites honored by Buddhists worldwide, and the photography is gorgeous. Recommended.",1390780800,5,680,4.862068965517241
