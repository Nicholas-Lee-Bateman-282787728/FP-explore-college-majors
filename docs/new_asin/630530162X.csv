1007792,5,630530162X,"I think it was so courageous of Shania to take care of her siblings after her parents got killed in that head on collision.  She is a woman who truly gave her all in life, and she really strove to make the most of it.  She  started out in poverty, and she ended up having several multi-platinum  albums, and many #1s.  She marks an era in both Country and Pop music, and  she hit the #1 spot in both categories.  Coming from me, an aspiring  singer, I know it's not easy.  Shania, my dream would be to sing with you,  and you truly are #1!!!!",931046400,10,542,4.076190476190476
1007793,5,630530162X,"Of the ""VH1's Behind the Music"" series of documentaries that I have watched...Shania's was the most uplifting and entertaining of them all.  After watching the video the first time, it showed me that her road  to success was paved with hard work, personal tragedy, and perseverance.",920419200,2,282,5.108695652173913

Shania makes some nice music and looks great in latex, but I honestly don't remember buying this VHS tape.

7887369,5,630530162X,This is the one hour biography of Shania Twain. It is very enjoyable with her great music mixed in. She started out with Country Classics and eventually moved over to pop. She's now one of the best-selling female artists of all time. This video explores the years of heartbreak and sacrifice that led to Shania Twain's breakthrough and crossover success. You will see rare footage of Shania's pre-teen years.,1109203200,4,408,4.927536231884058

7887371,5,630530162X,"I think that the VH1 behind the music are very interesting and I am glad they do it.  It makes you realize that all artists do not always have the world handed to them on a silver platter.  Shania grew up in poverty.  Shania had to struggle to keep her family together after the death of her  parents.  She gave up everything in order to put food on the table.  With  her great success, (thanks to the help of her hubby Mutt Lang) She does not  take life for granted, I think she knows, that it all can be taken away in  just a short period of time.  She appreciates the value of money.  And she  gives back to the world what she has been given.",951350400,6,645,4.031746031746032
7887372,5,630530162X,I love Shania and had no idea that she had such a tough childhood.  Now I have much more respect for her.  This biography is sad at times.  You will cry!  Shania's had a few tough breaks but she learned from them and made  herself a success.,951264000,5,241,4.042553191489362
