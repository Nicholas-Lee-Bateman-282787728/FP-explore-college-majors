8176647,4,B000FUZCMQ,"The Young and Dangerous series was extremely popular in Hong Kong, based on a comic book series and filmed in a MTV stylish way, when MTV actually played music videos (those were the days). The Young and Dangerous series focuses on tough, cool, young triad members fighting for honor, status, loyalty, turf and revenge. This entry into the latter part of the series is not as violent as the earlier entries, has more romance and focuses more on the always cool and charismatic character Chicken (Gordan Chan) called Cock in this movie. Recommended for all fans of the Young and Dangerous series, especially those who enjoy the character Chicken or Cock as he is called in this movie. You do not have to have seen the other films in the series as each film stands alone but will enjoy it more if you have a frame of reference.",1372377600,,825,4.581081081081081
