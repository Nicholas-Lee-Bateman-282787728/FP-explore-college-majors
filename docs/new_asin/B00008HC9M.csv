7984206,5,B00008HC9M,"Extremely well done, faithful to history, this biopic of the last years of Manuelita Saenz, who gave her life for the man she loved, Simon Bolivar, shows her as an exile, selling triinkets to passersby, while she reminisces about her life with South America's Libertador.  It moved me to tears.  I suggest you watch it in conjunction with ""The Liberator""--though I like the later, because of its Chavista twist at the end, much less.",1429056000,,433,4.837837837837838
7984207,4,B00008HC9M,"I was surprised by this movie that though it lacks sweeping views and pyrotechnics (I mean, battle scenes), it makes up by its touching feeling of intimacy. It is 1856 and in the forgotten town of Paita, an old, disabled woman earning her living by selling tobacco and sweets hardly wants to remember her former glory days, thirty years ago when her name, Manuela Saenz was called on either in disdain or in admiration.  However, prompted by a curious young Herman Melville and feeling that death is near since unfortunately, Melville's whaler ship has brought the plague to Paita, Manuela recalls her relationship with the Liberator, Simon Bolivar.

The movie moves back and forth between the elder Manuela whose scenes are filmed in sepia tones and the younger Manuela, which are in color.  Viewers are witnesses to her first encounter with Bolivar, the tension that her infidelity and defiance provoked in her English husband, to her many separations from and reunions with Bolivar as he fought for the independence of South America, and to her courage on the infamous night of the murder attempt against the general.  But it is the elder Manuela, reading out Bolivar's old letters at times or dishing out her poignant comments at others, the one who brings all these flashbacks together and gives them meaning while at the same time, revealing that under her toughness and disappointment, her love for him still burns strong.

Beatriz Valdez makes for a very convincing Manuela, both young and old.  Mariano Alvarez plays Bolivar well, especially during the scene when he's alone under the bridge.  I couldn't help but feel the sorrow that must have started to creep in Bolivar's heart as the reality of the murder attempt hit him and his dream of a united Gran Colombia started to fall apart. The few things I don't like about this DVD are that the English subtitles cannot be suppressed. They also don't make justice to the lyrical voice of Manuela and whoever decided to cut the elder Manuela scenes out of the Scene Selection deserves to be booed.  The R-rating is for some brief nudity; otherwise, this movie would be PG-13 appropriate.  This ""little"" movie is a commendable effort toward redeeming Manuela Saenz. Those who have never heard her name will discover this important historical figure, but I think viewers who are already familiar with Latin America history and Bolivar will be the ones to appreciate this movie better.",1379721600,,2440,4.931707317073171
7984208,4,B00008HC9M,"This is the first movie I watched about Manuela Seanz in order to do my thesis. The movie takes the most publicized and well known events in her life and puts them in a movie. It is an overview of her life. I think it is a great movie due to the antiquated tint the film has while Manuela speaks about the past, her life, her love while exiles in Paita, Peru. This is to show the historical aspect of it. But if you think about your memories, aren't they in color? That is why most of the movie is in regular cinematic color. This movie is Manuela telling Herman Melville her story. I will say that you will not fully appreciate this film unless you have a basic understanding of who Manuela is. For instance, she shoots one of her dogs [she is not a bad person you have to see the film] because in her dimentia she thinks it is one of the men that betrayed the idea og gran colombia since the dog bears that persons name. I only gave it 4 stars because it only portrayed the main known events of her life and did not go deeper. This is a good film to start with if you have read at least 1 book about Manuela Saenz [not a book about Bolivar].",1183161600,,1143,4.061946902654867

7984210,5,B00008HC9M,"Una muy buena pelicula que presenta a Manuelita durante sus ultimos anos en el norte de Peru y tambien incluye recuerdos de su tiempo con Simon Bolivar.  Hubiera sido interesante ver algo de la ninez de Manuelita en el Ecuador o su tiempo en un convento antes de casarse con un ingles.  La pelicula es fiel a los datos de su vida e incluye la visita de Herman Melville y Simon Rodriquez a su casa en Peru.

Los colores varian segun el escenario -- colores amarillos cuando ella ya es una senora vieja y tormentada en un pueblo pobre de Peru contra colores mas brillantes en Gran Colombia cuando ella era una mujer elegante, audaz y joven (aunque estas escenas generalmente son de noche).

Los prejuicios tradicionales contra Manuelita -- que no era fiel a su esposo, que no se portaba como una senora digna, etc. -- no deben ocultar la energia y contribucion de una de las mujeres mas extraordinarias en la historia de America Latina.  Con el exito de la obra de Garcia Marquez (""el general en su laberinto"") y peliculas como esta, el mundo por fin esta valorando a esta gran mujer ecuatoriana.",1138924800,,1094,4.561224489795919
7984211,2,B00008HC9M,"As a historian of the Andean wars of independence, and a fan of 19th century romance, I looked forward to the Risquez treatment of the Saenz-Bolivar affair.  The incidents and settings portrayed are generally accurate, but the definitive treatment remains to be done.

Actually ""Manuela Saenz"" is two movies.  The sepia-toned film about Manuela's last days of exile in Paita, on the desert coast of Peru, is quite effective.  Jaworski's use of lighting is wonderful.  Beatriz Valdez is good at evoking the melancholy, half-life existence of a 50-something invalid woman dreaming of her lost heroic past.

But the movie's telling of role of La Saenz in the rise and fall of Gran Colombia, in which her relationship with Bolivar was only one element, is sadly lacking.  The color flashback scenes are fragmented, small and constricted.  Where sweeping shots of the Andes are called for, Risquez just offers us the odd llama munching on the paramo.  Beyond a little street fighting in Lima, there are no battle scenes, in spite of the fact that Saenz actually watched the battle of Pichincha from a Quito rooftop and was a uniformed officer on the field at the decisive battle of Ayacucho.  (Bolivar failed to show up for either clash of arms.)  Nothing is made of Saenz's career as a spy-master for the revolution in Lima and Quito before she ever met Bolivar.

Worse, Valdez's subdued acting style, while appropriate for the Paita scenes, further deadens sequences that ought to tell the story of a free-thinking revolutionary who more than held her own among the imposing men of the Liberating Army, including Bolivar himself.  On the other hand, Mariano Alvarez does a good job as the increasing weary Bolivar.  What is missing is the way Saenz was able to reinvigorate Bolivar's energy and idealism.  Frankly, I cannot see what Bolivar could have possibly seen in the ho-hum version of Manuela Saenz offered by Valdez.

Let's hope that the rumors turn out to be true of Salma Hayek making a big-budget Manuela flick (""La Mas Bella"") with Ecuadorian director Vctor Rubn Rodrguez.  This story has Hollywood epic written all over it, while Hayek looks and can play the part.",1123804800,,2173,4.925824175824176
