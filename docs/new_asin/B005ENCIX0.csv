4666933,3,B005ENCIX0,"Hart is an acquired taste. I appreciate his variations on a limited range of plot situations, but for his films to work they require sympathetic, responsive, and at times dramatic music--too often missing here. The print quality is generally quite reasonable - I would rate it no higher - and some night scenes have been printed so dark that the action is impossible to make out. In one night time sequence footage seems  missing or edited out of sequence, but it's all too dark to be sure. After all of these caveats, the film is enjoyable and outdoor sequences, as always in Hart's movies, are convincing. The disc is colourfully packaged, but needs more sympathetic care in its production. Early music is ""wowy"" as if played from a faulty power source.
A final note. I have seen one reviewer indicate that the film's title refers to Hart's horse's name, but this is not the case. An American colloquialism, ""Sand"" has the same meaning as ""True Grit"" in the novel and film of that name, a quality of courage and determination, which Hart ascribes to his beloved steed, but which we might feel deserved by Hart's character as well.",1368144000,2,1132,4.717171717171717
4666934,5,B005ENCIX0,"This is a very good William S. Hart film.  Released in 1920, most of the outdoor scenes were shot in and around Victorville, CA in the Mojave Desert about 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles.  The scenes include the Upper Narrows, the Verde Ranch, the Victorville Station, the Santa Fe Hotel, and the Mojave River.  Also includes some great train footage.  What makes these outdoor scenes in and around Victorville even more special is the great camera work by Joe August.  Furthermore, the story moves along nicely, and members of the the supporting cast do a good job, particularly Bill Patton and Fritz (Hart's horse).  Lastly, the resolution quality of the print used for this DVD (Alpha) is excellent, from the Samuel M. Sherman Archives.  Amazon's price (under $8) is very reasonable especially considering the excellent quality of the print.  If you enjoy a good William S. Hart film, this one should be in your collection.",1338940800,10,928,4.903846153846154
8468753,5,B005ENCIX0,"Sand is a great story which follows suspenseful plot twists and turns, romantic entanglements, and some humor, with an exciting ending to boot!  I love William S. Hart's face; he reminds me of Gary Cooper with his weathered face and rather shy manner, and in this film he sobs over the presumed loss of his girl, whom he thought he was about to marry.  His love for his horse Fritz (""Boss"") is always evident, and I love the way he communicates with him.  The train shots were great, the music was fine, the scenery was rugged (river action especially impressive), and the costumes were very authentic:  Everything, as always in a Wm S. Hart film, looks REAL.  The only downsides were:  The film is very old and grainy, but that probably can't be helped unless it is remastered someday; the titles overall were longer and took longer to read than in other silent movies, but I got used to that as it went along; and the leading lady's extremely frizzy hair was annoying to watch.  This last remark seems picky, I know, but I've watched many silent movies, and after appreciating many different hairstyles over the decades, I have yet to see one like this, which actually distracted me from the story whenever she was in a scene.  All in all, though, Sand is a terrific Western, and William S. Hart an actor to watch, especially when he rides or interacts with his horse Fritz!",1494115200,2,1376,4.587755102040816

8468757,3,B005ENCIX0,"Fairly amiable western fare. Has more comedy in it than most of Hart's movies. It's a fun movie. The only thing that really bothered me was the canned movie score that covered everything from classical to smooth jazz, Just weird. recommended ..",1463875200,,244,4.833333333333333

8468759,3,B005ENCIX0,"Great Description Amazon, how about a little more? Oh I don't know maybe something that actually describes the premise of the movie without giving it all away. Well at least it doesn't have ""et al"" tagged after every entry.",1454371200,,223,4.743589743589744

8468761,5,B005ENCIX0,"One of the later William S. Hart westerns from 1920, this one is superb. As another reviewer noted, the print at times was dark and hard to see but not so much that it distracted overall from of the film. The background music was better than we have come to expect from the films that Alpha puts out, although it does not match the action very well at times, in fact it was almost enough to drop a star for me.  However, even at that , this one is another one definitely worth adding to your library, complete with Hart's trademark tears and love of his pinto pony. (And, 'Sand' does not refer to Fritz the horse, his name is 'the Boss' and he has 'sand'!)",1406419200,4,656,4.2063492063492065
8468762,4,B005ENCIX0,"I love westerns. Bill hart's era was a long time ago. and in those days they did not take good care of films as they do today. His films are very good but the quality is not. But hey we are lucky to have them.
