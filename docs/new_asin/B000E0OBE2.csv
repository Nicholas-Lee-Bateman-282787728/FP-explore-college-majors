8103153,4,B000E0OBE2,This movie is fairly dope.  You can totes use it for sub plans if you have to take some days off in March to watch dope hoops games.,1398988800,,132,3.7142857142857144
8103154,5,B000E0OBE2,"This DVD is a little outdated, but it's definitely worth showing to my high school students when we study the play.  Baz did this project before his Romeo + Juliet, so it's interesting to see what he says about the play, characters, themes, etc. if you know the film too.  It's a great watch for teenagers who will be performing Shakespeare as they study the play.",1371772800,,364,4.5
8103155,5,B000E0OBE2,I had to write an essay in Theatre about this video. It was quite interesting. I really enjoyed watching it.,1365033600,,108,4.45
8103156,4,B000E0OBE2,Great for upper middle school and high school.  It's better if the students already have a slight grasp of Shakespeare.,1355961600,,119,4.95
8103157,5,B000E0OBE2,"What a joy to watch an actor who has risen from sidewalk to Broadway return to his roots to cast, direct and present R&J with people of the streets of his youth and reveal how little dreams change over the years and centuries.  Kind of a documentary of what theater is.",1298592000,,269,4.2745098039215685
8103158,4,B000E0OBE2,"This contemporary documentary featuring rap and young, novice actors is a good addition to any R&J unit. I usually show it after Act III; it doesn't give away too much of the plot, but leaves my students wanting to read more of the play. The commentary by Baz Luhrmann is excellent and really helps my students understand why Shakespeare is a writer for all time.",1279584000,,363,4.6
8103159,4,B000E0OBE2,"I paired this with a unit on Romeo and Juliet for my middle school drama students.  We read a shortened version of the script from Theatrefolk, then watched scenes from both the Luhrman and the Zefferelli films to compare them.  We finished up by watching this documentary.  Because the actor behind the project and most of his recruits are urban minorities, it caught the attention of all my students.  In fact, combating stereotypes and racism is a strong thematic element here.  My students got to see the process of a full amateur production in all it's wretched glory - the idealistic director badgering and cajoling his actors into embracing the reality of their characters, the actors who alternate between nervousness, ethusiasm, frustration, giddiness and determination, the promising actor who can't hack it, the newbie who catches onto Shakespeare's fiery comet and becomes a person transformed.  Drama students know this intense process from the inside, but it's great to see it from the outside as well, and you couldn't ask for better material.

This was appropriate for my students, although there is a scene that discusses the sexuality of Romeo and Juliet's relationship.  It involves some close contact so I suggest you preview before screening.",1253318400,6,1263,5.1568627450980395
8103160,5,B000E0OBE2,"I was predisposed to like this, because I love Shakespeare, both as a spectator and a performer.  But watching the experience these inexperienced actors go through is truly extraordinary.  The journey is magnificent and the destination well worth the struggle to get there.  Highly recommended, both for getting a better handle on why Shakespeare is still relevant in our modern times, and for seeing how opportunity and, ultimately, success can give people a means to re-evaluate and re-orient and decide that they can move past the boundaries they thought were drawn around their lives.  Bravo!",1237507200,,596,5.242105263157895
8103161,4,B000E0OBE2,"I stumbled across this version and absolutely fell in love with it. Usually, I don't watch much Shakespeare, but this behind-the-scenes of a Shakespearean production with amateurs was fascinating. It truly gave me hope not only for these young people from harsh backgrounds, but anyone who struggles with adverse life circumstances,(myself, included)! It was definitely worth the watching.",1160438400,3,389,5.724137931034483
8103162,5,B000E0OBE2,"This is really great reality entertainment, in all the best ways. The idea of inner-city-kids-meet-Shakespeare could be gimmicky, but it's not. Rather, the story is presented so freshly and truthfully, you immediately get caught up and begin to root for all the participants. It is exciting to watch these kids find their way into the characters they play. In particular, the storyline of Khpal (who plays Juliet) was a highlight - her gradual transformation from a shy, giggly girl to a confident actress (and person) was just plain inspiring. In fact, the whole film leaves you inspired, and it does it without being preachy, fake or cloying.

Well worth your time and money--Highly recommended.",1136073600,19,697,5.114035087719298
