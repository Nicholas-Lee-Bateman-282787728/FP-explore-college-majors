The dogs are all amazing to watch, (the humans are great too), and at a mere 18 minutes, you can't go wrong.  Also included is a making of that's longer than the film, so that's a nice bonus right there.",1316217600,,380,4.178082191780822
8535981,5,B005G50MU2,"Saw this on Good Morning America and have been dying to get my hands on a copy. What a funny movie! This hilarious story crosses into a dog world most of us probably never get to see. Bitter-sweet, funny and quirky. You won't be disappointed, comedy and dog lovers both. Check out the web site too and see what dog you are!",1314489600,,323,4.225806451612903
8535982,5,B005G50MU2,"The setting is from another era (seaside Britain of 20/30 years ago) and the relationship of the 2 main characters are very nicely done. Tony Booth is excellent and I love the way he plays his ultimate demise.
Dora Bryan plays her character beautifully absolutely the ideal person for the job.
The story of the principal dog is both funny and sad in equal parts.
A well crafted short film",1314144000,,388,4.557142857142857
