8680679,1,B00NW6KRY8,"My son is the biggest Iggy Azalea fan and I got this as a Christmas gift for him. We watched it later and he said it was the worst movie he had ever seen. Well I wouldn't even call it a movie. It was basically just video of a bunch of radio personalities giving Iggy a hard time. Even though it is called ""Her Life, Her Story"", it barely tells about just that. Please, just spare yourself some time and money by not even buying this. Thank You.",1423872000,5,444,4.056818181818182
