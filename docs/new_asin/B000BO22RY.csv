I like the narrated version (the only one I know of) and am delighted that this rare film made it to DVD, and Blue ray no less! I am ordering both and will report.",1361491200,,407,4.589041095890411
2431697,4,B000BO22RY,"Fred F. Trumble Floogle is the owner of a less than successful flea-circus. Struggling to pay his gambling debts, Trumble is most delighted when it's announced he has inherited a substantial amount of money from a recently slain relative. Jumping straight into the rich mans life style with his family, it's a shock when the dubious suit brigade tell him that all the inheritance money has been dissipated, thus sending the Trumble's into even worse poverty than before. But salvation comes in the form of a phonograph record, which on its reverse side has a message from the grave. It seems that $300,000 is hidden in one of the five chairs that Trumble got from the initial will reading. Trouble is is that his son has just gone and sold the chairs to a dealer, who in turn has sold them on to various people.

I'm not at all familiar with the works of radio star Fred Allen {Fred Trumble}, so going into this film blind as to his style of comedy was a bit of a gamble. Happily I can report that It's In The Bag, and Allen himself were a comedic joy. Backed up by the likes of Jack Benny, William Bendix, John Carradine, Rudy Vallee, Don Ameche and Victor Moore-Allen and the ensemble deliver quick wit and skits to laugh yourself hoarse with. There are some far better reviews of this film available on this site, ie: those more familiar with Allen and his influences, so I would urge interested parties to seek them out. For myself I just loved what I watched, skits around trying to get cinema seats and one involving William Bendix playing against type are excellent, whilst I barely contained my joy during a sequence as Don Ameche recites poetry during a riot. Full of gags both visual and oral, It's In The Bag comes highly recommended to those that enjoy old time comedy with a sharp and prickly edge to it. 8/10",1313798400,5,1822,4.5212121212121215
2431698,4,B000BO22RY,"The Product Description on this page is inaccurate. Fred Allen co-starred in Jack Benny's LOVE THY NEIGHBOR (1940).

In IT'S IN THE BAG! (1945), flea circus proprietor Fred Floogle (Allen) is bequeathed five old chairs by his recently deceased (from unnatural causes) uncle. Under Fred's instructions, his genius son (Richard Tyler) sells the chairs to an antique dealer who in turn auctions them to several high bidders. While the boy is on his errand, Fred receives a transcription disc. Side One is a worn recording of Frank Sinatra's ""Sunday, Monday or Always."" The flip is the uncle explaining that a seat cushion of one of Fred's chairs contains the name of his (the uncle's) murderer, plus $300K in cash. Now Fred must get the chairs back ASAP. The lurking nearby killer has also heard the record; he's determined to acquire them first.

Mr. Allen intros the opening credits of this farcical version of the Twelve Chairs story. His legendarily tightfisted radio ""rival"" Jack Benny has a scene at his Manhattan apartment where Fred pays a hatcheck girl, buys a pack of ""Luckys"" from a vending machine and rents Jack's chair for $10 a day. The voice of Benny's wife, Mary Livingstone is heard briefly in this scene.

Portland Hoffa (Mrs. Allen) is NOT here but Minerva Pious (Mrs. Nussbaum of Allen's Alley) has a small role, as one of the chair buyers that Fred visits. Also seen are Binnie Barnes (as Mrs. Floogle), Robert Benchley (an exterminator who's invented the better mousetrap), Bill Bendix (a vitamin-popping gangster), Jerry Colonna (a cash-obsessed shrink), John Carradine (the crooked lawyer) and Sidney Toler (the detective).

At a club where two of Fred's chairs are, Rudy Vallee, Victor Moore, Don Ameche (playing themselves) and foghorn Allen (basso pathetico) comprise a quartet of singing waiters. The uncrediteds in this silly little film include Doodles Weaver, Harry von Zell, Dewey Robinson, Sarah Padden and Rex Lease.

Recommended primarily to those familiar with Fred's and Jack's radio shows of the 1930s - 50s.",1286928000,2,2044,5.071428571428571

2431702,5,B000BO22RY,"Fred Allen makes me laugh.  He may not have that effect on some folks, but the bassett-faced, baggy-eyed, acerbic & brilliant radio writer/performer with the ironic and cynical deadpan delivery has always tickled me.  Alas, he's virtually unknown but to a few today, and as his main medium was radio with doubtless few if any shows extant we only have glimpses of him in a few films and his writings.  Allen was a true humorist, finding the absurdity in himself and his culture, and while his humor could be stingingly sharp, it wasn't mean-spirited.  A lost art, in many ways.

I can only recall him in ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" episode in ""O'Henry's Full House"" and with Ginger Rogers as the radio couple episode in ""We're Not Married"" for other appearances on film.  At any rate, we have ""It's In the Bag"" which is a riff on the old Russian tale of ""The Twelve Chairs"", and is really only an excuse for a series of sketches with Fred tangling with some of his radio characters and guest appearances/cameos by Jack Benny, Jerry Connola, Robert Benchley, John Carradine, Don Ameche, Rudy Vallee, Victor Moore and Bill Bendix et al.

And it is in these encounters we get the dry wit and delivery of Allen as his erstwhile Flea Circus owner Fred Floogle is beset and bedeviled by crackpot inventors, quack psychiatrists, crooked lawyers, surly theatre ushers and managers, and other contemporary woes of the times.  The best bit by far is with his great friend and the other half of his celebrated radio ""feud"", Jack Benny.  The banter between these two old pros is worth the price of admission: light, fast and wry.  Allen never spared himself in his gags, and the over-all experience is one of great good humor.

Definitely a piece of work for probably only a small few,  but considering that other than his writings this is about all we'll ever have of Fred Allen, it is to be treasured.  Any man who could write:

""All the sincerity in Hollywood you can stuff into a flea's navel and still have room left over to conceal eight caraway seeds and an agent's heart.""

must be treasured.  One can only hope for a DVD some day.",1174521600,4,2125,4.596816976127321
2431703,2,B000BO22RY,"This film reveals a sober truth about the major radio programs of the 1930s and 1940s: they weren't very funny.  You can learn that by listening to tapes of the old shows, or you can watch this movie, which revolves around Fred Allen and features Jack Benny.  Sadly, there isn't a laugh in the film.  There is much absurdity and many attempts to be humorous, but nothing comes off.  It's like an Olson and Johnson film. It's In The Bag is an embarrassment for Fred Allen, Don Ameche, Jerry Colonna, and William Bendix fans.  Jack Benny admirers have long learned to expect this sort of thing from his movies.  The Robert Benchley bit may be the worst he ever filmed--and that's saying something!  Binnie Barnes is competent and still beautiful at 40, but her lines don't give her much to work with.  In short, this is a dud, best forgotten.",1171843200,,840,4.553333333333334
2431704,5,B000BO22RY,"This is a funny movie, though under-rated. This and what I call the companion movie to a film called ""It's a Joke, Son!"" starring Kenny Delmar as 'Senator Claghorne' are must-have films for Fred Allen fans (even though Fred isn't in the second film with Delmar, it's based on a character from Fred's program.) On this ""It's in the Bag"" film, the one and only Fred Allen stars as Fred Floogle, a flea circus showman. The film is about a guy who has a wealthy relative who passes away. Fred follows human nature and starts buying expensive things and puts money on stocks. Fred thinks he's inherited his uncle's $12 million fortune but he doesn't get so much.

Angry, Fred has his son sell the chairs. It's only later that a vinyl record surfaces with Fred's uncle instructing him to claim the $300,000 he hid in one of the chairs! Too late...they've been sold to countless people all across town. This causes Fred to go on a wild goose chase tracking down the 12 chairs. This is where the film starts to pick up speed.

An array of '40s radio stars make cameo appearances: Rudy Vallee, Don Ameche, William Bendix, and the immortal Jack Benny. Bendix spoofs his ""tough-guy"" build by being a cowardly leader of a gang of muggers. Ameche and Vallee hit the stage in a night-club but the bass singer is missing. Fred joins them on stage as an imposter who sings a terrible bass section {by this time in the film he's running from the police because they think Fred is working for the Bendix Gang!}.

Along the way Fred encounters Mrs. Nussbaum (Minerva Pious, the same woman who played that character on Fred's radio programs) in an eerie segment that allows the viewer to see what ""Allen's Alley"" would've looked like had Fred went into TV full time. Jack Benny's scene is the stand-out of course. Cheap jokes are here...Fred acts like he's the president of a Jack Benny Fan Club and needs an item for display. Fred, of course, wants the chair that Nussbaum sold Jack. An assortment of sight-gags follow (including a cash register inside his living room and wax paper to wrap the chair in!). Concurrently Fred's being chased by a detective trying to prove that Fred is in ca-hoots with the Bendix gang.

Walter Tetley has a memorable role as an elevator operator. The ""immediate seating"" gag is hilarious as well. Jerry Colonna, the wide mustache maniac side-kick of Bob Hope, has a zany appearance as a psychiatrist who slaps himself across the face numerous time thinking a tsetse fly is swarming his face! Victor Moore plays the campy Chef and others making cameos are John Carradine, Robert Benchley, and Binnie Barnes. Fred finally tracks down the chair with the money but reality sets in...and you'll never believe what happens next!!

Fred Allen was a radio comedian from 1932-1949. He's famous for his topical humor, battles over censorship, battles with network executives, the ""Allen's Alley"" routine that ran from 1945-1949, and his fictional feud with Jack Benny. Due to Allen's inability to make it on TV with a major hit, the TV generation doesn't know him at all. In 1954 Allen headed to the fourth chair on the panel of ""What's My Line?"". Fred died in 1956 of a heart attack amidst his popular run as a panelist on ""What's My Line?""...a TV show of all things!! ""It's In The Bag"" might well be the greatest thing to showcase Fred, visually, aside from his ""What's My Line?"" years.",1073001600,13,3391,4.673366834170854
2431705,5,B000BO22RY,"It's a shame that only a chosen few REALLY KNOW who Fred Allen is. In the 1940's his popularity was that of names we still cite today - Jack Benny, Abbott & Costello, etc.
But in his day Fred's radio program was incredibly popular, as well as his ""fued"" with Jack Benny. If you love old radio, or old time comedy you will enjoy IT'S IN THE BAG. Fred Allen was, as still is, one of the smartest writers of comedy there was - even today great legends such as Mel Brooks and George Carlin cite his influence.
One drawback with the film is that to get all the jokes you will need to be familiar with ""the age"" when the film was released since some of Fred's jokes are dated (commentary about crowded theaters comes to mind), but some of the jokes are just as fresh today as they were 56 years ago (commentary on how relatives get in the picture, why do we need to watch credits, psychoanalists, etc.)

2431753,5,B000BO22RY,"If you do, you know Fred Allen. If you know Fred, you will enjoy this. It seems that there was a whole genre of entertainment that began and ended between 1930 and 1950.

This is another good example of this era",1362787200,,211,4.146341463414634
2431754,5,B000BO22RY,"""It's in the Bag"", (loosely based on ""The Twelve Chairs""), is a screwball comedy from the forties, with a first rate cast, including many cameo appearances from some of Hollywood's greats. To my knowledge, Fred Allen only made this one film. He was a radio performer, who had as one of his gags a long running on-the-air feud with Jack Benny. Benny is brilliant as himself in this movie. The plot is pretty thin, but it serves as a vehicle to hang the many jokes on. I am happy to finally see this movie again, as it has been unavailable for so many years. A laugh riot from beginning to end.",1361664000,,592,4.342342342342342
2431755,5,B000BO22RY,"Picture quality on Olive Films release of It's In the Bag is okay. The movie itself is better still. I've never seen the version narrated by Fred Allen. I grew up with this version. Of course, some of the jokes don't play but because they're tied to the time it was made but that could be said about almost any old comedy. The scene where Fred and his wife try to find seats in a theater running ZOMBIE IN THE ATTIC is one of the funniest sequences in screen history. Buy it!",1361664000,2,475,4.173913043478261

8090036,3,B000BO22RY,"Great film and wonderful vehicle for Fred Allen, a Comedy Classic!
Video quality is lacking unfortunately, it greatly limits upscaling ability of this disc. It displays linear pixelation horizontally, I find it disruptive.
If you really want to see this go ahead and buy it, a mediocre copy is better than no copy at all and the price is reasonable.
If you are a serious collector buy the Bluray edition, it has to be better than this.",1518393600,2,435,4.662337662337662

8090038,4,B000BO22RY,"Flea circus ringmaster, Fred Floogle, inherits $12,000,000 from his deceased uncle, only to find that the lawyers embezzled the money and left him only a few chairs and a phonograph record. The record is a recording of his uncle telling him there is $300,000 hidden in one of the chairs. The rest of the film follows Floogle going through outlandish and hilarious scenarios trying to find the chair with the money. Although outdated with corny humor, this film is packed with stars and comedians and is a lot of fun if you give it a chance.",1512432000,,540,4.635416666666667
8090039,3,B000BO22RY,"I wanted to like this film more, having read it is based on The Twelve Chairs. There are some funny moments but it is a little dated today and I suspect part of that reason is that it relies on popular radio personalities of the era trying to break into film. I am not familiar with Fred Allen but he is likable enough to carry the film, but the film has several dull spots where my attention waned. The highlight of the film is Allen's encounter with Jack Benny.",1502409600,,463,4.213483146067416

Bubble wrap pkg, and the tape was NEW in cello. LOVE THIS FILM. Odd, and unfortunately although I adore Minerva Pious, she needed acting training pre-Silver Screen appearance. Her facial expression was wooden, her ""bit"" went on too long- otherwise a fun film and any single person who loves Fred Allen should GET this. UCLA added the title to their Film Registry, in fact that's who the publisher? whomever owns it, is on the label. The sound, etc was as good as it can be for this film and year.
