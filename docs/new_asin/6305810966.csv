But like any other T&A film enthusiast would have been, I was eventually  rewarded for my perseverance. Jeff Kueppers plays a guy who is about to be married. He has everything - beautiful house, a great job, a new car, and a lovely fiance (Jennifer Marks). Then the trouble starts. A rich uncle has left him an old pirate chest and within its confines Jeff finds a bottle. After handling it a woman appears dressed in a genie outfit. She does not grant him any wishes as she (rightfully) assumes that she is the one prize any bachelor would ever want. Okay, the genie is played by Chandra Marie, a drop-dead gorgeous woman with an incredible body. Interestingly enough, it's her face that ends up captivating the viewer! This actress has a wonderful assortment of facial expressions that convey the whole gamut of emotions. She can pout, look hurt, appear miffed, look sexy, etc. and make you believe. She could make you laugh or make you cry with just one look. This woman should gain exposure in a mainstream flick, preferably a drama, one that that make better use her acting talent. She carries this film and, no doubt, she could carry any film she appears in.
  This is not to suggest the other actors and actresses in the movie are incompetent. On the contrary, all of the performances are very good although Chandra deserves the  kudos. As for the T&A viewer, this movie has more young lovelies than you can shake your stick at (or whatever). Pound for pound there is more succulent flesh on display in this one movie than in any other skin flick you will ever come across.
  The sex scenes are nicely shot and are soft core with an emphasis on ""soft"". Both the guys and gals are easy on the eyes. Yes, it's a couples film that was probably designed to be aired on Skinemax for late night TV viewing..
  The sound track is surprisingly classy, too. Many of the bubbly tunes add to the lighthearted atmosphere that permeates the film throughout its running time.  Buy the DVD - it is one of those guilty pleasures you can keep on the coffee table!",1441497600,,2174,4.483544303797468

7896293,2,6305810966,"The idea of the film is intriguing, and is what brought me to purchase it, but the viewing of it left me feeling like I've been chewing the air in a vacuum.  The film is mindless drivel, and while that can be overcome with an aire of fun, this movie did not support it enough times to be worthy of purchase.  Since the replay value is quite low, my advice is to save your money.  If you really must spend it, invest in Enron instead.",1051315200,29,433,4.070588235294117
7896294,3,6305810966,"Chanda Marie is the primary saving grace in this low budget skin flick. The story elements are so cheap and simple that it's almost camp. Chanda has a captivating, innocent, fun-loving, Valley Girl style quality and personality that saves the movie.  You get the impression she is being her real, amateur self, which, surprisingly, adds to the picture's quality.  In fact, the whole picture seems to be an amateur production, and I suspect that there was little rehearsal and few multiple takes in making this movie.  But the overall innocence, silliness, and fun the actors obviously had in making this picture make it fun to watch whether alone, with a friend, or group.  There are many similar skin flicks that are lots, lots worse.  I was confused during the first 8 minutes when they mixed the credits with what seemed to be the movie, as tho it was only a bunch of short vignettes.  An innovation that doesn't work very well.  I think that there are a lot of missed opportunities in the script that if done differently with a bit more imagination and thought, could have added so much more to its overall dramatic and erotic quality.  VHS version rated.",1031702400,36,1159,4.731343283582089
