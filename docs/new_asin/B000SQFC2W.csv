2889716,5,B000SQFC2W,"The CSI: NY show is my favorite of all the CSI shows. I love the entire cast of this one, unlike CSI: Miami and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
I am only able to catch the shows on TV every now and then, so I wanted to see the entire series from beginning to end. I just finished watching Season 3 yesterday, and I was so disappointed that it ended. Now I have to wait until Season 4 comes out on DVD to watch it. In my opinion, it is by far the best of all the CSI shows, and well worth the money.",1204156800,3,498,3.8446601941747574
