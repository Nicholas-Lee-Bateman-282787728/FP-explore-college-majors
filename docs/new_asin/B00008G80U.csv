7984084,3,B00008G80U,"A double Made-For-TV quality feature: Only With Married Men - Michele Lee plays a single woman who has been burned one too many times with single men, so chooses to pursue personla nd professional relationships with tenatively married men. And somewhere along the way, she falls in Love with a guy who only *says* he's married (Attorney David Birney) who has enlisted the assistance of his boss, Dom DeLuise, who pretends that his kids and his wife (Judy Carne) are really Birney's. And stuff like that.
Dom DeLuise and Judy Carne are very good, in fact, could have carried the picture, except that Birney and Lee fit the pre-Disco seventies thing a little better.
Well acted by all, yet the opportunities for DeLuise to really cut loose and for the dancers Lee and Carne to strutt their stuff (both are in pants throughout the whole deal - Judy couldn't sock it to us, a la Laugh-In) - confined to the clever but somewhat restrictive plotline.
Might not send one back up the aisle, or back to the frig., with a big smile, but has enough punch for a shoulda been/not bad minor diversion.
I Wonder Who's Killing Her Now - something about a mediocre at best, initially likeable, but almost entirely lost in Hollywood fantasty, corporate tree hugger, played by Bob Dishy, who married wealth, but  suddenly finds that his wealthy and attractive wife has outgrown his childish projections onto late movie icons and his psuedo intellectual leanings. At a high-end masquerade party he exaggerates even further as a Classical pianist. Though he hires a ""behind the curtain"" (remember Abbott and Costello's routine?) to play a real piano while he fakes it and has a small issue: his only musical ability is to dicern the difference between the low and high notes, in a comfortable stretch of octaves.
When he learns of Joanna Barnes' plan to move on, he panics, and playing another ""role"", he enlists some other ""California dreamers"" in the form of hopelessly incompetent lawyers, doctors, and hitmen, to complete the job he doesn't initially understand as being no theatrical excercise but a real tragedy if one of these crazies actually doesn't fail this time.
When his Insurance representative reports that the fake examination of Dishy's wife yielded nothing he could use in the evil beneficiary plot, he panics again, but this time in realization that he's in no late movie classic and must undo his insane whimsey. Problem is, with all the village idiots involved, and all the subcontracting, he has no idea who at the moment is poised to ""kill"" his wife.
By the end of the movie, he is frantic, running around in his Hospital gown, with a guy dressed as Dracula, and other dudes who also have watched too many film noirs at 2:50am.
Bill Dana and Vito Scotti kick up their heals, too, in this moderately successful blend of ""black"" comedy and wild farce.",1204848000,,2851,4.806517311608961
