4187775,4,B003S90LUY,"El Dvd es Exelente, en cuanto a lo Estetico, la Portada, los Discos y el Contenido del mismo.
La Edicion esta Bien hecha, aunque Le Faltan Partes Escenciales de la Historia de la Telenovela.
Note que faltan las escenas del Cenote de Alex y Maria Jose. Muchas de las Escenas de Ulises y Roberto, sobre su relacion homosexual. Las peleas de Raquel con Maria Jose y de Bruno con Roberto y Ulises. En concreto las escenas que faltan y quisiera que estubieran son la del cenote, sobre la historia de Ulises y Roberto, casi todas las partes que faltan, la pelea de Raquel con Maria Jose por Ulises, cuando Bruno discute con Roberto y sobre todo cuando Alex se pelea con Bruno por el Celular que le dio a Maria Jose, esa es una de las mejores escenas y sin embargo no esta en el Dvd. Despues la Edicion es muy buena, se entiende, tiene coherencia, y dejan mucho del final, casi que completo, solo faltan 3 escenas, que la verdad no son muy importantes, cuando Victoria habla con Fernando sobre el libro, el baile despues del casamiento y una escena que esta, pero recortada, cuando Bruno llama a Victoria para pedirle dinero.
Sortilegio Es una Exelente Telenovela y tiene una Maravilloza Historia, esta Protagonisada por William Levy y Jacqueline Bracamontes, con las Actuaciones Antagonicas de David Zepeda y Ana Brenda Contreras, y cuenta con un Gran Elenco, como Daniela Romo, Gabriel Soto, Chantal Andere, Marcelo Cordoba, Julian Gil, Azela Robinson, Otto Sirgo, entre otros...
(Para Mi) David Zepeda hizo un Exelente Papel Antagonico, uno de los Mejores Villanos, sin duda...
Me Encanto su Personaje de Bruno Lombardo, trabaja muy bien como Antagonista.
El Dvd Contiene casi 13 Horas de Resumenes de la Historia, Bloopers, que estan Muy Buenos/Divertidos, un Detras de Camaras de las Escenas y el Videoclip con la Cancion de Il Divo.",1287619200,5,1831,4.815873015873016
4187776,4,B003S90LUY,"""Sortilegio"" is very loosely based on the plot of 1985 Mexican hit telenovela ""Tu o Nadie"". I you are a big fan of an old version telenovela with Andres Garcia and Lucia Mendez you will like this version too. I would give ""Sortilegio"" a 5 star rating except one problem: the actress that is playing in this version is no match to a drop dead beautiful original actress Lucia Mendez. Jacqueline plays OK but looks so-o-o much plain Jane in comparison to Lucia. Since I know the original version very well, I felt very bad that they could not find a more beautiful actress for this role in Sortilegio. I know it's hard to match Lucia Mendez's beauty but they could still do better than Jacqeline Bracamontes.
I am wondering if they ever release ""Tu o Nadie"" on DVD, that was one of the very best telenovelas ever made!",1287014400,5,816,4.483221476510067
4187777,3,B003S90LUY,Beautiful Telenovela is really an enchanting Telenovela. William Levy and Jacqueline Bracamontes are a nice couple. Sortilegio de amor could have been better suited than Sortilegio as title!,1286323200,,190,5.821428571428571
4187778,5,B003S90LUY,"Even though some excellent scenes from the original production were not included, this condensation was well done. I was afraid that the original soundtrack was not going to be included but I was happy to watch this DVD thinking that it was almost as if I was watching the original. I wish the producers would have added some of the romantic scenes that were cut out even if we have to pay a little bit more. To me this soap opera has been the best I have ever seen in years and I will treasure this DVD. La actuacion the William Levy es la mas natural, la mas romantica que he visto. Esta pareja tiene mucha quimica y me encanta como trabajan juntos.",1283990400,3,651,4.300813008130081
4187779,4,B003S90LUY,"Sortilegio is one of my all-time favorite telenovelas. The show features your typical telenovela hallmarks; with the over-the-top plot points, evil twins, kidnappings and classic lines. The production value is excellent--great scenery (makes me want to go to the Yucatan) and the chemistry between Jacky and William as Maria Jose and Alejandro is second to none.

As somebody whose Spanish is not their first language (or second, or third); I always purchase the novela DVDs to get the English subtitles. And, like all novela DVDs, 95+ hours of the original run show has been cut down to 17 hours. While I knew that the slashing of the novela was going to happen; I was keeping my fingers crossed that some of my favorite scenes/parts/plot lines wouldn't get cut. Overall; the flow/comprehension of the storyline is good and what they cut made sense, but I was still seriously disappointed that some of (in my mind) the best scenes were left out. I am slightly biased towards the love story between Maria Jose and Alex, and some of their best scenes were omitted (ie. hotel scene, cenote) and some of the lighter moments with son Tony heavily glazed over.  I would have preferred to have those scenes included and some of the parts with the b-storyline and secondary characters get the axe.

I'm not sure who decides to make the dvd 17 hours long; but a few more hours would have made the world of a difference in my mind--I've seen other novela sets with 20 hours or so, so it's do-able.

The extras include bloopers, ""music video"" to Il Divo's interpretation of the theme song (which you will hear over and over and over and over and over and over throughout all the discs) and a ""making of"" feature which basically is various vignettes that were created to promote the show. I wished novela dvds had some of the more higher-end features/elements of other TV show dvds...would have found some type of commentary interesting.

All in all, the DVD is a must have for Sortilegio fans.  The story of Maria Jose and Alex is my favorite and always brings a smile to my face!",1283990400,46,2070,4.688705234159779

I do realize that DVDs of telenovelas are really just souvenirs, but, since I didn't see the original on T.V., the DVD leaves me wondering if there were ever any script writers at all.

4187829,3,B003S90LUY,The editing of the series should have had more thought other than how do we fit 95 episodes into 4 DVDs. There were many story lines and scenes that were needed to advance the beautiful story of Alejandro and Maria Jose that were not included in the DVDs and too many peripheral story lines that should have been cut instead. I am trying to learn how to speak Spanish and it was helpful to see it with the English subtitles. It was a good tool for me when I viewed the whole series in Spanish on another medium and I was able to understand about 50% of the story and I loved the series even more so when I saw it all. William Levy and Jacqueline Bracamontes do have great chemistry together. She did a pretty good job for her first soap opera.,1374883200,2,743,4.2027972027972025

4187850,4,B003S90LUY,"When industrial magnate Antonio Lombardo dies in a car accident, he leaves everything to his younger son Alejandro. But Bruno, the jealous half-brother, plots to murder Alejandro and take over the business. His scheme partially works and Alejandro survives a terrible accident only to discover to his surprise that he is married to Maria Jose, a girl who was deceived by Bruno as part of his nefarious scheme.

Doctors tell Alejandro he suffers from memory loss but he is convinced he never met Maria Jose before and goes in search of the truth. Alejandro is played by William Levy, who makes Brad Pitt look like Ernest Borgnine. This has it all: a fake marriage, identical twins, chemically induced amnesia, car wrecks, evil plotters, and lots of ""who's your daddy?""

I love over-the-top melodrama and romance, and I understand that telenovelas are heavily edited versions of TV soaps. Granted, some of that editing is choppy but we can easily fill in the blanks and race along with our beleaguered hero and heroine, knowing that somewhere, somehow, they will end up in each other's arms; villains vanquished and love will prevail in the end. What fun!

I first checked this out from the city library but was delighted to see it was available on Amazon.com, so I've happily added it to my library.",1326672000,2,1298,4.864253393665158
4187851,5,B003S90LUY,"This telenovela absolutely drove me nuts!!! I love telenovelas, but this novela had me hooked like a drug!! It just wasn't me, but a good proportion of the citizens of my country :-) As I recall, the streets that were clogged with traffic would suddenly be clear from 8 to 9 pm when Sortilegio was being screened.

I absolutely LOVED the character ALEJANDRO in this novela!! Whoever wrote the screenplay reached into my head and produced my idea of the perfect man, much like Mr Darcy. And William Levy in all his handsomeness just made me fall in love with the character even harder. :-)

Back to the DVD. I am glad that the DVD was abridged, because I absolutely couldn't stand Maria Jose's father. He was such a weak man, and he used to annoy me ROYALLY in the TV screening. Thank heaven I didn't see much of him on this DVD!! The bloopers were great to watch! Its interesting to see how much the actors and actresses are NOT like the characters they are playing as they cuss and joke about on set.

However, as I have mentioned in my review of Novelas I have bought, Televisa needs to consider releasing novelas in their entirety, add other languages to the subtitles in addition to English, and not restrict the DVD to Region 1.",1321401600,2,1233,4.471111111111111
4187852,5,B003S90LUY,"This was and so far is the best telenovela I have ever seen. It is my favorite. Alex and Maria Jose make a perfect couple together. I hope to see another novela with them two again. This is a ""must have novela."" Highly recommended.",1318464000,,231,4.2727272727272725
4187853,5,B003S90LUY,The editing in this soap is very good. There are time when you are like WTF... but the VAST majority of the time you understand what is going on and can follow it easily. Now b/c of the editing you do need to WATCH it b/c it is EDITED so you need to pay attention. The twists are not excessive either. they def keep you very much interested. I HIGHLY recommend this.  b/c of this novala i bought another one that william levy is in. can't recommend this enough!!!,1316822400,,463,4.202247191011236
4187854,1,B003S90LUY,"The film on it's own is very interesting when viewed on decoder, but if you make the mistake of purchasing the DVD for keeps, it is not worth the stress because i already bought it and i regretted doing so.
I purchased the film because i really enjoyed the it on TV but to my surprise, It was badly edited, a lot of the scene on the TV or decoders were removed, reasons i don't know. So you really need to have a rethink before purchasing this item because it is not worth the money paid for it.",1309046400,5,495,4.061224489795919
4187855,4,B003S90LUY,A very intriguing love story and the chemistry between the two main characters is simply...amazing. A lot of editing done and some lovely parts missing from the one seen on TV but still loved it. The fact that it does have English subtitles is awesome. I would recommend this movie to anyone.,1307750400,,292,4.634615384615385
4187856,5,B003S90LUY,"William Levy did excellent in this show.  His step brother is so jealous, greedy and just plain evil.  He ends up with a lying wife who betrays him a few times yet William Levy's character is so compassionate and forgiving.  He even puts up with his lying in-laws who are so complicated.  Not to mention his mother-in-law who is in love with a nutty doctor, they end up brain washing William Levy's wife and reprogramming her into living the life of her twin sister.

Very entertaining, especially the part where stranded in the Island with a little boy Toby.",1304035200,,559,4.606060606060606

Estoy decepcionada con este producto que Televisa saco al mercado...Estuve  meses esperando y no valio la pena!! Muy mal por Televisa y por Carla Estrada, este DVD no esta a la altura del gran trabajo en esta novela, la mataron por editarla tanto!!
The best scenes were edited /cut out, what was the point of putting out a DVD that does not contain even the scene seen on national television!!! I was looking forward to this DVD for months for nothing, I'm extremely disappointed in this product and on the creators for editing it to death...they killed it!! the scene I'm sure a lot of fans were looking forward is gone...shame on Televisa and shame on Carla Estrada for allowing this DVD to be produced without the ENTIRE story! WHAT WAS THE POINT!!???",1294617600,8,854,4.731543624161074
