I will definitely be purchasing others.  The director and narrator have really found a great way for you to appreciate these beauties on film.",1256860800,5,414,4.554054054054054

8164545,5,B000LV6VVU,"The video provides a wonderful recap of Ferrari history, which is retold through the driving of actual collectors cars on private roads in the U.K. and Italy. You see and hear those fascinating cars - that alone is worth the price of the DVD (some archival footage is also provided)",1491264000,,282,4.66

8164549,5,B000LV6VVU,I give this video out a lot as gifts to Ferrari people because of its quality and it's just SO different than most documentaries. You HAVE to see this if you are at all interested in Ferrari GT history.,1382227200,,202,4.205128205128205
8164550,2,B000LV6VVU,"Some real problems here, unfortunately.

DeCadenet is wonderful; smart and articulate, the perfect host for this.  The cars are well-chosen, nicely presented and we get to see them and hear them being driven fast.  Great so far.

But the video quality!  Dear oh dear, what went wrong?  This looks just like someone took the 480x320 TV version of the file and just stretched it to approximate 1080p.  It looks dreadful, with fuzzy jaggies everywhere.  The original photography HAS TO be better than this.  That Speed Channel tries to sell this DVD as high-quality for $25 is shameful.

So how to rate something like this?  Such great content, such poor quality video.  For this money, we deserve much better.  Two thumbs down.

(Go read ""Grumpy""'s review of the 6-disk set.  He also sees the problem here.)",1338681600,,805,4.859259259259259

8164552,5,B000LV6VVU,"If you love the red cars you MUST buy this.

Inside the first five minutes my palms were sweating and I was breathing hard.

Gorgeous photography, beautiful locations, and enthusiastic, highly informed commentary make this simply the best video exposition of any marque I've ever seen.

I'm going to buy all the others in this series.

Now, a few years later I have more of this incredible series and all I can say is it's like going to church.  These videos are a perfect way to expose younger car crazies to the real deal.  Modern performance cars like the Camaro, Corvette, and  Mustang top end track-monsters  are are truly amazing but they fall short of the  hand made art of these classic 50's and 60's autos represent.",1306108800,2,725,4.645669291338582
8164553,5,B000LV6VVU,"A great review of some of Ferrari's most outstanding vintage cars, many of which are now multi-million dollar collector cars.  The sounds are awesome.",1292889600,,150,5.25
