8057558,4,B00096S2QE,A lot of information about the writer and the making of War of the Worlds. Disc 2 had a great deal of scientific information about Mars. This was a nice surprise Worth having and well done!,1424217600,,189,4.277777777777778
8057559,4,B00096S2QE,"Got this despite a couple of so-so reviews... and was impressed with both disks. I am not a fanatic about The War of the Worlds, so maybe it's a bit different for me (if there are any errors in the historical piece, I didn't see them). Enjoyed the history of Wells. Lots of trivia, some more interesting that others but all worthwhile.

Disk 2, the science of Mars stuff (""100 Years of Exploration""), was really good. Best Mars doc I have seen anywhere- including some of the cable offerings. For my money, the inexpensive cost of the set is worth it for that disk alone.

Remember, YMMV.

8057560,4,B00096S2QE,"Got this two-disk deal a week ago. Avoid the British War of the Worlds at all costs- bad movie. The Documentary, of the other hand, was really fun. I would have liked some more movie clips, but the info was unique and many facts i had never heard or read for that matter.

Disk two was science, and some rare stuff tehre too. Great ocmputer animation and nice old footage from jet propulsion lab in LA that I never knew existed.

Overall a very nice rendition of art and science about the red planet. Too bad Speilberg forgot that the War of the Worlds was about Mars!!",1124755200,,569,4.308411214953271
8057561,3,B00096S2QE,It's not a Spielberg film but it is a technically well done documentary detailing the history of the story War of the Worlds. Some interesting facts and history including some little known spin-offs and interpretations that I had never heard before. Loved the computer animations of the exploration of Mars on Disc 2.,1123545600,,317,5.0
8057562,4,B00096S2QE,"I bought this just after I saw the Spielberg film. I must say that overall I liked the DVD set a lot. While I would have liked to hear more of Orson Welles on the 1938 radio show, there was a lot of interesting stuff in disk 1 about Welles and the later panic broadcasts I had never seen. Overall, very interesting and informative.

Disk 2 is a Mars science piece with some amazing animations I have never seen. Overall, I'd have to say that it ranks high when compared to some of the other shows on DVD about Mars. Lots of interesting stuff and be sure to look At the Mars Expedition Rover animation. I don't know who did it, but it rocks.

I'd give them a combined 4 of 5. Next time be sure to get the Welles voice!",1123545600,3,717,4.078014184397163
8057563,1,B00096S2QE,"This documentary is a total bore. There are no clips from the movies, no excerpts from the radio program, no interviews with anybody important and the interviews there are go on forever. You won't learn anything you don't already know about H. G. Wells or the ""War of the Worlds"". Very disappointed.",1120348800,17,299,4.769230769230769
8057564,1,B00096S2QE,Disc one is an historical retrospective. It's dull. Nothing in it that we didn't know already. Tape quality is very good. Archival footage they could have used they didn't. Not one science fiction writer interviewed. Clips from the 1938 broadcast wasn't used. Instead the narrator tells you about it. Too general.,1120003200,22,313,5.1568627450980395
