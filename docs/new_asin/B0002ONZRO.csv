8029973,2,B0002ONZRO,"A fan of the book and of Disneys great film, any new version is welcomed if only to see how the producers would tackle the subject matter and envision the victorian submarine Nautilus.  Unfortunately,

this version tries to please everyone by modernizing the tale and throwing in every sure-fire idea the writers could think of.  Arronax is now a youthful, handsome genius, with a troubled relationship with his father.  Nemo is a mad genius,(with a bionic hand!)-who takes him under his wing and becomes a surrogate father figure.  Ned land is so desperate to escape he goes looney and smashes the nautilus salon windows drowning in the process.  We now get a black man among the cast and an interacial love affair- Arronax loses his hand and gets a mechanical one too. (Star Wars rip -off) Etc, etc.  Really- they tried to please everyone.  Perhaps the only thing really going for it is the

nice production values and interesting design of the Nautilus.  Save your money.",1116288000,4,974,4.813253012048193
