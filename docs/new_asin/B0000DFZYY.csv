8000970,5,B0000DFZYY,"The words of Mr Luchino, the nice fellow that Saga works for, but also a concise summary of the roller coaster that Saga goes through in the four episodes of this volume. While Volume Four was mainly concerned with Sugar and her friends' search for ""twinkle"", this volume shifts back to the life of Saga. In the first episode Sugar doesn't return from her trip with the other season fairies on time, causing some distress for Saga. An experience that's all too familiar for most of us. In the second episode, the town has its annual festival. Everyone comes out dressed in their traditional clothes and celebrates the local culture. A very enjoyable and fun episode that ends with the best fireworks display that I've ever seen done with animation. The third episode is concerned with cleanup after the festival and includes many flashbacks to previous scenes from earlier in the series. It also gives a nice lead-in to the fourth episode. I won't say much about episode 20 to avoid spoiling for anyone. In this episode, Saga must deal with a personal loss and it is just a wonderfully beautiful presentation that deeply touched me. A powerful display of the Saga character as a human person that left me very impressed by the quality of this production. I would recommend Snow Fairy Sugar for anyone that enjoys anime or drama or both, young and old alike.",1085184000,5,1357,4.729957805907173
