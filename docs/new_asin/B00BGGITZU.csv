8568081,4,B00BGGITZU,"Clive of India tells the story of Lord Robert Clive, the man who help Britain gain control of India in the in the mid 1700's.  Ronald Coleman is Clive and as ever is a great actor and he is fun to watch.  Colin Clive, whose most remembered line is ""It's Alive, It's Alive, is a direct descendant of Lord Robert Clive, plays the friend of is ancestor.  The movie is a bit slow, and the battle action is a bit hard to follow,  Cesar Romero plays a Maharajah, who Clive helps become the King of India. You can'tr miss his signature voice, behind the makeup. Loretta Young plays Clive's wife.  she was a lovely woman.  As a historical movie it is an interesting British of the history of India.  This is not a great movie, but it is a good movie.  The movie could have been so much more, but I don't think they had the budget was big enough to make a great movie.  Much of the story is told with inter-titles.  I liked the movie.",1440720000,,925,4.175141242937853
8568082,3,B00BGGITZU,I checked Clive out on a few websites and he led quite an exciting and adventurous life. The story here is too truncated and the video is rather poorly copied to disc.,1424131200,,167,4.25

8568084,3,B00BGGITZU,"A bit disappointing, even though Roland Colman is one of my favourite British actors from the 1930s.  The film focused too much on Clive's relationship with his wife (Loretta Young), being somewhat of a soap opera. My overall rating is B+.

I agree with another reviewer that the battle scenes were done on the cheap, but I did enjoy the armoured war elephants!

Video quality was excellent, but the sound track - at least on my copy - had lots of noisy static from beginning to end.",1419465600,5,483,4.528735632183908
8568085,4,B00BGGITZU,If you love Ronald Colman (and I do) this is great. Still it suffers some from a less than great script. The battle scenes are less than one might expect. You get the feeling the studio was cutting costs. It is still worth seeing and a young Loretta Young (not bad).,1398729600,7,266,4.235294117647059
8568086,4,B00BGGITZU,Very old genre but still a good story about the empire.  Engaging.  Worth a look if you've an interest in the period.,1389398400,9,117,4.2727272727272725
