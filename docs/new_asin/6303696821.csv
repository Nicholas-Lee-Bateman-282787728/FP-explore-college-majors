723800,5,6303696821,"Although in the movie she is diagnosed with clinical depression that is not what the character has.  Drew Barrymore's character displays the perfect diagnostic criteria for a Borderline.  She is reactive to certain situations and rapidly changes moods with overwhelming emotions, she is exactly like me.

*Contains Spoilers*

""A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.""

In the beginning Drew Barrymore is exciting, interesting, wild, and intense.  She falls completely in love with Chis O'Donnell's character and obsessed with him.  When he refuses to leave class after she pulls the alarm she doesn't talk to him for days.  Their relationship becomes very intense and leads to concern from their parents.  Chris really shines in this movie because he plays the perfect responsible and care-giving individual that would be attracted to and give care to Drew.  He is innocent and naive which is the type of person a borderline would desire.

""Impulsiveness in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving).""

This is the most obvious in the movie.  She pulls the fire alarm, she takes a trip with Chris to a waterfall during school hours. She jumps into the lake after she and her parents have a fight.  She runs away from home with O'Donnell in fear that their parents will send her away and have her leave Chris.  She drives recklessly while turning the last minute only to wreck the car.  She attacks the driver that picks her up and steals his car. Drives off after she catches Chris talking to her mother in fear that he is trying to abandon her.  Smokes cigarettes.  I believe because it was a PG rated movie they did not have her do drugs or have sex with many partners.

""Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself.""

She pulls a gun to both of their heads, and attempts suicide.  She talks about her parents and her father which makes her upset and she goes into the bathroom and starts crying and having an anxiety attack.  Threatens to kill herself and holds a gun to her head. I believe they didn't make her a cutter because of the PG rating.

""Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).""

She pastes pictures of dozens of faces from magazines in an insane sort of of way.  The episode in the bathroom also.

""Chronic feelings of emptiness""

Her behavior is an example of her feelings of emptiness.  When she calls late at night because she just needed to hear from him.  It's hard to explain this but as a borderline myself i did the same thing.  It's like you fear the person doesn't love you anymore and you need reassurance constantly.

""Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).""

She burns the guy in the car with her cigarette.

""Transient, stress-related paranoid idealization, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms.""

When Chris is selling his telescope for cash she spaces out and experiences a dissociative moment as if she is seeing the world out of herself. This is a good example because of the camera work and score.  She believes he doesn't want her anymore just because he calls her parents.

""Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.""

This as with feelings of emptiness, is seen throughout the movie by her behavior in general.  I think an example of this is when she posts all of the pictures of women from magazines so they can 'look at her' makes her feel a sense of identity.

Over all this movie perfectly shows the personality of a Borderline Personality Disorder sufferer.  Medications can't really help other than treating symptoms like depression or anxiety.  The affect on the family and boyfriend also show how real life families struggle with a loved one suffers from it.  Chris is often walking on eggshells to avoid offending or hurting her.

What makes this movie so good is the perfect example of a mental illness.  This is a rare thing to seen in movies, usually they mix disorder u p and get them all wrong.  I recommend this movie to anyone that suffers from or know someone that suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder.  I suffer from it myself and set my first boyfriend through the ringer like she did.  Once I found out what it was, well now I know what i have and am getting the right treatment for it.",1302825600,2,4760,4.944514501891551
723801,2,6303696821,I was an extra in this movie over a decade ago & that's the only reason I bought it.  But I never seem to get past the two scenes I'm in.  Which tells you how compelling this movie is. I love Drew and would just like to say she's as adorable and sweet in real life as she is on any screen. Two stars because the movie really does blow but I only spent a total of maybe $5. And $5 to have my 4 seconds of fame and all the memories of the Seattle Scene back in the 90's...priceless.,1242000000,,480,3.79
723802,5,6303696821,"it sounds kinda dry in the text but its a great movie.  boy next door type almost sanitarily clean matt.  his mothers dead and hes kind of taken on her role as a second parent to his little brother and little sister.  the little brother has athsma and the kids are two little pestering younger siblings.  very convincing.  matt has a best friend (played by matthew lillard, man whatever happened to that guy) one day they see casey(drew barrymore) getting agrivated with her trunk and matt falls in love on the spot.  hes very ""white bread"" and casey is not.  she has a wildness about her which matt needs.  matt has a innocence and stability about him that casey needs.  after a fight with her parents which threatens to take her away from matt casey attempts suicide and is sent to a mental institution where matt busts her out.  its a road film.  casey got to know matt before the hospital and on the road matt learns that theres alot more to casey than he took to heart.  casey is mentally ill (schitzophrenic,  clinically depressed... i dunno) he loves her deeply but he knows that he doesnt have the knowledge to help her other than to love her (which he does unconditionally).  its a spiral of events leading to a melt down basically.  its a fun movie to watch.  its not depressing though it is sad.  the characters are so colorful and it is set in seatle during the grunge age (man i miss those days, and the music).  if you love drew barrymore movies or chris o donnel (which i do in both cases)  then get this movie.  don't psycho analize it just get it.  i never get tired of it and jump to the chase and get the soundtrack too because as soon as you watch the movie your just gonna order it too anyway.  its a time capsule.  great music for anyone who was a teenager in the grunge days.",1235606400,,1798,4.333333333333333
723803,3,6303696821,"I'm not sure what I was expecting going in to see this movie for the first time, but I did not find it in ""Mad Love.""  This movie reminds me of ""Fear,"" partly because of its location and the age of its cast, and the two movies certainly have their parallel's, but there is no self-tattooing or killing of the family pet.  Much more of cult hit then mainstream, Drew Barrymore carries this movie.  You definately have to take the movie for what it is because the more you think about it the less plausible it becomes.  This movie could go either way with its viewers, its just all about personal preference.",1144972800,,606,4.383928571428571
723804,3,6303696821,"This movie is cute, but not factual. I always worry when I see mental illnesses treated as interchangeable. Drew Barrymore's character Casey exhibits class bipolar symptoms, which include irrational thoughts, suicidal depression, and wild mood swings going from risk taking mania to the immobility of depression. I just wish they'ed been able to portray it for what it was.  Of course making a movie about clinical depression symptoms wouldn't have involved the car stealing and drama. Just lots of Drew sitting in her room, unable to muster the energy to find Chris O'Donnell interesting. Not as good a movie, I suppose.",1124755200,3,621,5.148514851485149
723805,5,6303696821,"This film is about a high schooler named Matt (Chris O'Donnell) who has a crush on free spirited Casey (Drew Barrymore), so he finally gets the guts to ask her out, and they go to a punk rock concert together. They start to really like each other, and become boyfriend and girlfriend. One night, Matt sees Casey fighting with her parents, and she tells Matt that her father thinks Matt is a bad influence and that her father doesn't want Matt to see her anymore. Sooner or later, Matt hears that Casey has been put in the hospital, due to the fact that she tried to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills. Matt helps her escape, and the two lovebirds take a road trip against parental wishes. Along their way to Mexico, they encounter a sellsman who tries to hit on Casey, and Casey begins to experience depression episodes again. Matt learns that Casey is Bi-Polar, and he tries to comfort her the only way he knows how. He decides his only option is to get her help, so he decides to call her parents. She attempts to commit suicide again, telling Matt that she doesn't want to be sick anymore and that she doesn't want to be locked up. Matt talks her out of it, and they return home, so that Casey can recieve medical treatment. This film may or may not sound interesting, but it's a great film nevertheless. Drew Barrymore and Chris O'Donnell give excellent performances. Recommended.",1121990400,11,1389,4.56
723869,5,6303696821,"Ah...mad love. This movie was on HBO ON DEMAND and I decided to watch it one lazy summer day. I really got into it, mainly because I felt like I could relate to some of the things in the movie. Drew Bareymore plays a great role, as a depressed teen trying to break the habit and find love. She does..but her parents don't approve of the young man who lives across the lake...you know the deal. They run away and ""try"" to make it on their own. She can't deal with being away because she really is mentally ill and the tears started to flow because she ends up in a hospital writing letters to him at the end. God! I cried and cried and cried! Tragic love story...definately add it to your collection today.",1120435200,5,705,4.229629629629629
723870,4,6303696821,"...and probably chris o'donnel's best movie too. IT starts off as a very enjoyable movie at first, then it peels away it's cover to show a very sirious side. And in the process Drew Barrymore's acting is fantastic. If only she stayed that way instead of making worthless unmentionables like Charlies Angels. ANd Chris Odonnel is along for the ride. His  quiet tempermental acting shouldn't work with Drew's fierce character, but somehow it does. The only complaint is that Odonnel is usually the same in all of his movies, and this one doesn't change. His just like he was in Scent of a Woman, but he's still enjoyable.

723871,4,6303696821,"I think Drew is portraying a person with schizophrenic tendencies with the over sensitivity to sounds and pasting the eyes on the walls...

723876,3,6303696821,"This film had terrible music. The Plot was great but Paula Milne (screenwriter) didn't expoler the millions of different (and better) twists and turns that the chacters could have taken. This movie was supposed to resemble the ""edgy"" teen movies of the 1980's and it doesn't. The parents in the movie are portrayed as the bad guys which is very typical of teen movies.  Chris O'Donell who is a talented actor does his best to work with so little and remains one of the few shining light in a very dark film. Drew Barrymore plays the same part she plays in almost every one of her movies only this time her chacter has a mentel illness. The only good thing about her preformence was her and O'Donell's great chemestry.",1040947200,,717,4.558139534883721
723877,4,6303696821,"Chris O'Donnell and Drew Barrymore star in this fast paced movie about two people who set off on their own and leave everything behind.  O'Donnell stars as Matt, a straight-laced honors student who dreams of going to college.  Barrymore is Casey, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who is suffering from clinical depression.  Matt spends his evenings spying on Casey through his telescope.  Finally, he asks her out on a date, and they fall for each other.
Meanwhile, Casey's parents decide that Matt should no longer see Casey, and they forbid him to see her.  She takes a handful of pills and ends up in rehab.  Matt comes and breaks her out and they start on their cross country trip.  However, there are mishaps along the way.  They wreck their car and find that money is hard to come by.  Casey has another bout with depression, and finally they are forced to return home.

7854573,5,6303696821,I have loved this movie since the day I saw it in the theater with Diet Coke spilled on my lap. Classic. Sweet as apple pie Chris O'Donnell and 90s free love child Drew Barrymore against the backdrop of gritty 90s grunge? SOLD. I love it.,1472169600,,238,4.195652173913044
7854574,1,6303696821,Didn't even get to enjoy this movie the picture quality sucked and it rebuffered so many times it took me two days to get through the whole movie. This isn't the first time this has happened,1471996800,,190,4.305555555555555
7854575,5,6303696821,A great  journey about to young people who don't want to be separated from each other. Drew Barrymore gives a killer performance in this.,1469836800,,137,4.708333333333333
7854576,5,6303696821,"So, I thought I would be a good boyfriend (I got this before we got married) and get this movie for her. I think its some sort of tale of high school whatnot where Drew Barrymore and her siblings take care of an alien. Wait, thats another movie. I dunno, it has Drew Barrymore and Robin and they fall in love, or something. Im guessing they face conflicts too. Maybe they even fall out of love, or their relationship is challenged? I don't know. My wife likes it (or at least she did like it).",1468368000,,493,4.2
