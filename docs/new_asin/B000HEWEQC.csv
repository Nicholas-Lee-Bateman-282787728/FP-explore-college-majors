2636841,5,B000HEWEQC,"this package not only gives you two amazing bollywood horror films it also provides an awesome documentary.  now i know to be on the lookout for pakistani action films and south indian religious epics.  THANKS!

A note to indian film makers - hollywood films are not ENGLISH.  they're AMERICAN.",1184112000,,294,4.938775510204081
2636842,5,B000HEWEQC,"This release by Mondo Macabro shows that nobody can beat them when it comes to introducing weird and fantastic movies from all over the world to the DVD collectors. Both Purana Mandir and Bandh Darwaza have long been regarded as one of the finest examples of Indian horror cinema. This is an acquired taste. You may not like these movies if you are weaned on 90-minute Hollywood slashers. But if you are open to experimenting a bit, enjoy a level of camp, and musical interludes in between some genuinely creepy momemnts, you cannot go wrong with these purchases. The transfers of these 2 films are the best I have seen, given that they are very obscure and the original film elements were never stored properly.

The interviews and essays are fascinating. This is an ESSENTIAL purchase for lovers of horror cinema.",1160870400,9,815,4.780141843971631
2636843,5,B000HEWEQC,A wonderful window on the world of Bollywood Horror - two movies are included here that makes this extra good value - and there's tons of informative and interesting extras. These movies look a little rough round the edges but they look far far better than can be expected - thanks to Mondo Macabro for having the dedication to release such obscure and fascinating movies,1160179200,7,371,4.723076923076923
2636844,5,B000HEWEQC,"Gotta hand it to Mondo Macabro video - They really know their audience!  Although I'm no expert, I'm always interested in seeing how other cultures view various genres through film, and not only does MM give us two prime examples of Indian horror, they throw in a cool documentary on Indian films, plus other bonuses.  Sure, the film quality isn't 100% perfect, but it doesn't detract from the fun of the films.  If you're looking for ""Terminator"" style action, these probably aren't for you - but if you're even slightly interested in seeing how singing and dancing numbers are integrated into a Dracula story, by all means check it out here!",1160092800,6,643,4.774774774774775
2636845,3,B000HEWEQC,Both these films are available as video cd's on the internet. 21$ for 2 dvd's is a bit exorbitant for a recompressed dvd that will give you vcd/vhs quality. None of these movies were ever released in dvd quality and have always been available on VHS and vcd only. These films are more or less like the cult B grade kung fu movies that go for 25$ for 50 of them!,1159833600,,361,4.098591549295775
8139328,4,B000HEWEQC,This case came fast to my mailbox and the ink on it lats a long time. I think the price is very reasonable,1453680000,,106,3.652173913043478
8139329,5,B000HEWEQC,Great case for my granddaughter--arrived right on time as promised--and a great price as well.,1453161600,,94,5.333333333333333
8139330,4,B000HEWEQC,"I am satisfied with my product. It was undamaged and just as described, being a very nice investment, however the case is a little pixelated than I would like and not as thick/sturdy. I recommend this product! It is worth the money",1452384000,,231,4.523809523809524
8139331,4,B000HEWEQC,seems pretty durable right now but i did just get it. The design on the back is nice didn't come out ugly,1446076800,,105,3.8181818181818183
8139332,2,B000HEWEQC,"Doesn't fit phone well. Oh well I guess you get what you pay for. Be really careful when dropping phone,vthis case isn't much of a case in my opinion. The artwork is lovely though, I just wish it was a better quality case. I gave a photo to show how it doesn't quiet protect the front.",1445040000,,285,4.107142857142857
8139333,4,B000HEWEQC,looks good but not very flexible plastic so I will have to be careful,1437696000,,69,4.0
8139334,5,B000HEWEQC,"Other people seem to have had issues but I feel like if you drop a thin plastic phone case, it's gonna break. You get what you pay for. I for one have had no issues with this case",1413417600,,179,3.736842105263158
8139335,1,B000HEWEQC,My daughter loved the artwork but the case broke within a week. It cracked down the side and wouldn't stay on the phone.,1407888000,3,120,4.260869565217392
8139336,1,B000HEWEQC,I didn't liked because it breaks to ease,1406419200,2,40,4.125
8139337,5,B000HEWEQC,"You say SPAIN! ENGLAND! JAPAN! MEXICO! GERMANY! FRANCE!
CANADA(Cronenberg..you all softy) and of course the good
old U.S.of A.! But what about INDIA! They to can have their
Horror and HORROR they shall have! To tell the truth I know
nothing of the two films on this disc. I have seen the old school
ghost story Mahal(aval.just now from AMAZON) and my fav.
India HORROR pic. so far KHOONI PANJA! Which has a ANTHROPOPHAGUS
like MONSTER. India HORROR from waaay back was alot like the
HORROR we are now getting from ASIA. Meaning they were really
about the lost of a love one and him/her coming back as a ghost.
Not until the 70's(YES!..Oh! Sorry got carried away) did India
explore TRUE BLOOD! The two Ramsay's Bros. Saw $$$ from these
pic. and poured them out by the bucketful. The English Amicus
and Hammer pic. were very popular back than and if Her Majesty
can do it,by all India can too.  I give this 5 stars for the
info they had on India Horror through the ages and felt
it was highly educating. India now is not so much into the
HORROR now as it was in 72-94 They to did remakes of some
of our greatest FRIGHTNING films some are THE EXORCIST(which
I am told blows the DOORS off Beyond the Door and Abby)Night
of the Living Dead(but of course) HENRY:PORTRAIT of a SERIAL
KILLER(was not expecting that!)and HELLRAISER except not
a PUZZLEBOX(sorry PUZZLEMAN)but a LAMP!(THE LAMP! YOU RUBBED
IT.....WE CAME)and a SLAY of others. The cover shows Dracula!
So please try something diff. In your HORROR diet,try a taste
of the TAJ!
NOTE: Again I am new to this HORROR from Bollywood they like
U.S.A.(us!)have their stinkers as well. The ones that look like
they deserve a look-see are INSAAN BANA SHAITAN,KABRASTON
the popular DARWAZA and LOURD BALA..Keep in mind some of these
will have a song or two from the leading actress, alot like
our 40's HORROR(why they feel they must do that I don't know)
HORROR movies will always have a audience all over the world.",1192147200,,1960,4.6
