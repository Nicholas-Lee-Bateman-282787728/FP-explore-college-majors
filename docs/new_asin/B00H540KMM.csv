6132858,5,B00H540KMM,"This is a lush19th-Century style production from a Met that has taken off in a different direction in recent times trying to find a new audience, and I for one am glad to see it.  Each and every performer has wonderful insight into their character, and with the exception of ""Mama"" not a wobble in the bunch.  I've not been a huge Anna Netrebko fan, but I'd never seen her in opera performed in her own language.  Her Tatiana is youthful and charming as a shy teenager, and regal and womanly as the Princess Gremin.  Mariusz Kwiecien is both handsome and loathsome (as he should be) as Onegin, the manly womanizer with a wonderful opinion of himself.  Piotr Beczala is handsome, foolish and heartrending as Lenski, and if you're not in tears at the end of his aria on the field of duel you're not doing it right!  The soprano singing Olga, Tatiana's sister and Lenski's beloved, is both beautiful and on point in that role and the Met Chorus and Orchestra are top notch.  I wish someone would buy Valery Gergiev, the talented and sensitive orchestral director, a decent suit.  It looks like the same one he wore to the Olympic opening, and as if it had not been pressed since this recording.  That was my only ""down"" observation in this whole thing.  Even if you're not an opera fan, watch this!",1396137600,6,1295,4.51931330472103
6132859,1,B00H540KMM,"Performance worth listening. I mean just listening.  Stage set and costume tacky shabby cheesy.  This is a story of aristocrats in the late 19th C imperial Russia. Costume fit for peasant cottage party.
And a duel with rifle?!?
One more thing.  Nobody scribbles (NOT 'write' in this dvd) a love letter holding a notebook in the air and spinning no matter how much she is excited. I wonder what happened to the writing desk.",1396051200,15,423,4.6891891891891895
6132860,5,B00H540KMM,"The entire cast sang and acted marvelously.  I had recently watched the new production from the ROH.  I liked their twist on the presentation with the first two acts representing the reminiscing by Tatiana in the third act.  This Met performance received the ""standard"" treatment with each act being in real time.  Some of the ROH scenes were a bit awkward on first viewing but I thought it better than the standard on later viewing.  The Met cast and staging were superior to that from the ROH.",1395792000,6,495,4.64367816091954
6132861,5,B00H540KMM,"After having read Pushkin's novel/poem some years ago, recently I encountered Ralph Fiennes' film version which gave me a better visual understanding of the novel. This opera blew me away with its magnificent singing, set designs, and elegant staging not forgetting the sweeping music. The dance scenes were spectacular and almost gave me the opportunity to embrace my wife and try to replicate the dance steps in our living room. We did not as our dancing days are over.

I found the letter writing scene most compelling as I deeply felt her feelings. Such universal feelings for a woman to have. Her relationship with her nanny became an interesting subplot for its trust between them both.

The Russian workers music and dance scenes in the first act and the ball in the last provided an elegance to the production

The Met has done it again!",1395446400,14,845,4.813793103448276
6132862,5,B00H540KMM,Wonderful production; wonderful singer by fine acting opera stars at the top of their game; beautifully captured on the DVD....I enjoyed watching the performance again which I had first seen at the Metropolitan Opera this year....,1395100800,4,230,5.416666666666667
6132863,3,B00H540KMM,The first part of the story is left outside how Onegin gets to the countryside after his uncle died. The opera begins with Larina and she is listening to her girls Olga and Tatyana. Onegin is introduced by Lenskij. Tatyana falls immediate in love with him.  He rejects her love and kills Lenskij in a duel after the party of her Saints day. Time pass and Onegin finds her well educated. The story turn inside out and Onegin is the one with strong love and passion but Tatyana rejects him as he did early on. The kiss is a little bit dramatic in the end. It is a lyrical opera and Tchaikovsky transformed the book by Pushkin very well. The opera is traditionally performed and the pictures are beautiful. I like the orchestral part very much. The actors interpreted the characters in their own way and the opera is very well played. Anna Netrebko sings the letter scene very well and the final scene is good.,1394928000,3,907,4.463855421686747
6132864,5,B00H540KMM,"Have not yet received my copy of this production, but, as it is the exact same edition as the HD cinema presentation I had the great pleasure of viewing, I am anxiously looking forward to having it in my collection so that I may once again immerse myself in the exquisite artistry of this Metropolitan Opera offering.  The vocalists, conductor, musicians and chorus are all in splendid form and the acting and design aesthetics perfectly capture the period and mood of Pushkin's great novel.",1393286400,4,491,4.845238095238095
6132865,5,B00H540KMM,"Like Mr. Ascher, I ,too, am basing my review on the Met performance on PBS last night. The principals were all vocally outstanding. The Letter scene sung by Madame Netrebko  gave me goosebumps. Her acting was superb. I must admit I have been  rather lukewarm about her past singing. There was a sort of harshness at times. Her voice has rounded with age to produce truly breathtakingly beautiful tones. I don't think I will ever witness a better performance in my lifetime. She was absolutely stunning in her red gown in the final act.
I love Triquet's aria and was disappointed by the singer's interpretation. The voice was very harsh and unpleasant. This role must be sung by a French singer to achieve the full effect. The Met orchestra with Valery at the helm was superlative as always. I must have this for my opera dvd collection straight away.",1390003200,11,850,4.697986577181208
6132866,5,B00H540KMM,"I would have given this 5* even without the singing!  The acting, direction, costumes, dance, filming, cutting were all that good!  Add to that the quality of singing, not just the principals but the secondary roles as well, absolutely superb!  We benefit much from the availability of Slavic singers.  There is a quality of inflection, tonality that you get from a Slavic voice doing Tchaikovsky that western voices just can't match - - in my humble opinion.  Did I mention that the conductor was Valery Gergiev?  I was eager to see this because the principals were Anna Netrebko, Mariusz Kwiecien, & Piotr Beczala the same principals from the MET Lucia.  Beczala is a much better actor this time around, but all are stellar.  Forgive the superlatives, but this really deserves high praise.

In case your wondering, no, I don't own this disc yet. I've ordered based on having seen the telecast last night.

UPDATE: Received my copy yesterday.  In process of viewing again several things stand out.  First, the stagecraft.  Interior and exterior space are combined so we see interior action with exterior action viewed through the windows in background.  Lighting enhances the effect with candles inside, sunlight streaking through translucent windows. Second, the direction.  Many bits of action between the principals add dimension to their characters, such as playful bits of horseplay on the part of Olga provoking retaliation on the part of Tatiana who would rather be left to her solitude, reverie and reading.  Third, choreography.  Bits of dance added during the chorale numbers enhance the relationships between nobles, staff, and peasants.

I also found the interviews informative.  We learn that Netrebko and Kwiecien read Pushkin as children, having to memorize vast sections of verse adding to their understanding of the story.  The interview with Valery Gergiev touched on how Netrebko has matured as an artist over the past 20 years.  Something we are fortunate to witness in her recorded videos ranging from Betrothal in a Monastery, to I Puritani to the present day Onegin.

I have to mention the Onegin production staring Renee Fleming and Dimitri Hvorostovsky, also from the MET.  I own this as well and find it to be an okay mounting.  However, the sets were lost in a fire prior to production so it suffers from a minimalist, barren setting.",1390003200,27,2362,5.0595854922279795
6132867,5,B00H540KMM,"saw this in hd broadcast for met opening.  Best onegin I have ever seen.  Letter scene is triumph for netrebko.  Entire cast ranges from great to strong.  My wife, who memorized the Pushkin novel, demanded we buy as soon as released.",1389916800,7,233,4.609756097560975

6132870,1,B00H540KMM,"The performances profaned Pushkin's work. The Tatiana Netrebko played was like a maid, instead of a doe-eyed, innocent aristocratic maiden. The Onegin played by Mariwuzs was like a low-life having a grand time instead of a bored, sophisticated aristocrat. The Lensky played by whoever was like a scattered-brained person instead of a poet. What a pity. This generation of performers doesn't have any knowledge or understanding of the roles they play. Maria Callas read history book so that she would understand the role better and portray it more precisely. This generation is like coming out of an accelerated program, with no proper training, literature-wise and acting-wise. The cultural heritage is lost in the hands of this generation.",1470614400,5,740,5.333333333333333
6132871,5,B00H540KMM,"An all around beautiful performance. Superbly sung. The only fault I can possibly find is the dance sequences. They didn't live up to Tchaikovsky's sublime  music, but since this is opera and not ballet, who could complain? Highly recommended.",1457654400,,243,5.230769230769231
6132872,5,B00H540KMM,"Let me be honest here. I am in love with Netrebko. She could sing the Gettysburg Address and I would swoon.  But that said, how many productions of Eugene Onegin can you really love? This is one of them. Sigh.",1453075200,2,209,4.225
6132873,4,B00H540KMM,"I don't own this disk, but saw it on met on demand, so I'm pretty certain it's the exact same cut. I'm actually a fan of Netrebko, however I didn't find her protrayal of Tatiana as a young naive girl convincing at all. Another reviewer said she's a bit old for the part, I don't disagree that she appeared so, but I've also seen (also on met on demand) Renee Fleming who did this role with the met in 2007, who was probably nearly 50, looked way more convincing as a young vulnerable girl. I also preferred Flemings singing in this role. But this production looks more lavishing than the austere 2007 one. One thing I really really enjoyed in this one is Mariusz Kwiecien as Onegin. His final scene was incredible, both in singing and acting. I felt he really stole the show here and made it worth watching for me.",1448582400,3,814,4.3618421052631575

Mariusz Kwiecien's acting and singing are exceptional as the emotional and evocative rich spoiled dandy, Eugene Onegin. He plays the worldly count with intelligence and coolness which is fitting to the role and he has a great baritone voice. Piotr Beczala plays the young Lenski superbly, and plays the young coming of age and attractive Lenski supurbly and his tenor voice is bright and beautiful. The sets are good and the costumes are very beautiful and both go with the period of the opera. The videography and sound are superb as well. The sound is excellent and it gives you a being their front and center row perspective and no body mics are used. A supurb all around production. 5 stars!",1448409600,,857,4.797297297297297

Perhaps  because they understand Pushkin and Tchaikovsky and have read and listened to the poet and the composer since their school days, it is hauntingly beautiful.

If ever music had Shakespeare's ""dying fall"" it is the overture as played by the Met's wonderful orchestra. This and an earlier Met Onegin DVD are conducted by Valery Gergiev -- if there were a DVD of Gergiev conducting, that would be worth watching!",1429574400,4,560,4.9361702127659575

6132883,5,B00H540KMM,"Since I saw this production on PBS last year I found it very good with a strong cast and beautiful scenery.
I had two other very good versions, but I decided to buy this one because the scenery was completely different.
The main character played by Mariusz Kwiecien was very convincing. His acting and singing showed the complexity of this role: vanity and inconformity brought him to kill his best friend and being alone at the end.
Tatiana played by Anna Netrebko also had a transformation going from an innocent country girl who was in love with Eugene to a mature woman who didn't betray her husband for this old love from her youth.
The last scene was Eugene and Tatiana and their last duet reflects the chemistry between them.
Linsky played by Piotr Beckala also had a very important role; his character is very well shown in his last area before he got killed in a duel by his best friend feeling betrayed by him and his fiancee.
The choruses and dances were very beautiful.
The quality of the DVD is outstanding.",1427587200,9,1020,4.579234972677596

6132886,5,B00H540KMM,"This Met Opera performance is quite good on all counts. While some liberty has been taken with the staging (updated to what appears to be the late 19th century), there is still a natural feel to the mis-en-scene that does not seek to distract the viewer (or listener). The major vocalists acquit themselves admirably, but, for me, it is Piotr Beczala's Lensky that really steals the show--he is magnificent. Both Kwiecien and Anna Netrebko exhibit an almost unbridled passion in their roles; indeed, it is this passionate, very life-like approach to their roles that makes this a believable and, thus, desirable ONEGIN. The Bolshoi and Mariinski productions continue to occupy pride of place, vocally, for me, but this one makes a very convincing emotionally-stirring case for the opera.",1412726400,13,787,5.15625
6132887,4,B00H540KMM,"This production was very good. The sets and costumes communicated the Russian atmosphere created by the co poser.
Georgiev withe Met orchestra revealed the beauty of the score
for me,Netrebxo gave a very nuanced interpretation of Tatiana particularly in the letter scene. The Lensky of Beczala brought  tears to me in his aria  encore his death. Kwiecien was okay ,but I have seen and heard better Onevin.
In all,it was a very satisfying performance.",1411084800,2,450,5.0675675675675675
6132888,1,B00H540KMM,"As an audiophile, I expect *a lot* from a production on many levels and although the performances are quite good, the sound engineering and Spartan stage and costumes left me feeling flat. Featuring one of my favorite contemporarty operatic world-class performers, Anna Netrebko, I expected much more from the investment backing this production. And Tchaikovsy has always been one of my favorite composers right up there with Mozart and the three Bs so I was looking forward to being audibly entertained. But that changed as the curtain rose in Act 1.

First, let me extend my opinion about the D-G audio recording: It lacked its usual balance, emotion, and magic. The orchestra was nicely engineered but the volume level of the orchestra far overpowered the melodic voices of the perfromers. In the opening scene of Act 1, several performers are behind the main stage singing their hearts out and are barely audible (I am being kind with the word barely). Although this was the intent to create contrast and a more dynamic entry of the star performers, the blend was way too weak and thin. There were numerous places back stage where additional microphones could have been easily concealed but the opportunity was lost and the result is acoustic chaos. Similar dropouts occur on the main stage where as key people move from location to location the vocals drifted in/out and if it were not for the subtitles I would have completely lost the content. Hint: next time use wireless microphones.

Next, the set intself was pretty mediocre consisting of the usual stairs, doors, windows, and curtains found in such operatic venues giving you a sense of rooms and delineating indoor scenes from outdoor events. However there was so little color that you were convinced  it was more of a prison than a rural estate. Although Tchaiovsky intended this to be a sad tale, this interpretation was a bit under-the-top.

And the costumes...well, let's say that if you like drab, you will enjoy this production immensely. Again, costumes lacked charm and color that - with a small change - could have made the difference betweeen boring and fascinating. Another opportunity missed.

Truthfully, I could not watch the performance to the end. Again this was not the fault of the performers but rather the people responsible for the production. I can only imagine how disappointed the performers felt in not being able to clearly hear their efforts and then having to don such below-average costumes. Pity.

Overall, I was underwhelmed and rarely do I say this. From the stellar cast, I expected much more in support of their talents. Wait for this one to come out on Netflix and then skip it.",1405728000,11,2676,4.92239467849224

I am very pleased with the choice.  Manufactured and sold by Deutsche Grammophon, this All-Regions disc has the main menu in English but you have the choice of subtitles in English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese and Korean.  Audio is in High Def. PCM stereo and DTS-HD Master 5.1 as well.  The voices, acting, directing, sets, lighting and quality of the video and audio, are exceptionally fine.  For those who do not have a Blu-ray player, remember: this Blu-ray disc won't play on a standard DVD machine.  But, I expect that a standard DVD of the same performance, would be almost as good.  From my perspective, and for others who have a Blu-ray player, the few additional dollars-cost for this Blu-ray disc released in 2014, buys a lot more enjoyment from a very fine year-2013 production.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Eugene-Onegin-Blu-ray/dp/B00H540KMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin [Blu-ray</a>]",1403222400,3,1547,5.666666666666667

6132895,5,B00H540KMM,"Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that having Slavic speaking artists for the major roles and minor roles as well, does make a difference in the final product of this Russian story and Russian opera. I'll not rehash the accolades, well deserved as they are, also given by most previous reviewers except to say the whole project - sets, scenery, lighting, costumes, chorus, principals and extras were all right on and first rate. The whole atmosphere was set by the first few notes in the orchestra as Valery Gergiev led with a restrained hand this delicate, magnificent Tchaikovsky score. What enfolded was a true theatrical performance, again restrained as would be a Chekov drama but as deep as life itself.
Anna Netrebko looking more ""solid"" than in her ""Lucia"" and ""Puritani"" days, continues to conquer yet another opera standard as well as many specialist and lesser known roles. In all of these she does her homework and really ""gets into"" the character she is playing. For ""Tanya"" she had the great advantage of having memorized verses of the Pushkin drama as most Russian children do, as a child in school. So her superb acting was based on long familiarity with this material and it showed. She was youthful, awkward, shy and bumbling in her first encounter with Onegin and in the following letter-writing scene. Ah but the transformation to Princess Gremin was a caterpillar-to-butterfly change and the new refined lady worked it's magic on the enthralled Onegin. He is now the pleading one. She now calls the tune.
Poor Lenski, played and sung superbly by Piotr Beczala was an innocent country boy who believes and accepts everything at face value. He could not believe the mock playing-up to his betrothed Olga by Onegin was all in jest. M. Beczala  played him as clueless and guileless but a beautiful person and that's the way Pushkin makes him out to be. This innocence is particularly apparent in his deservedly famous ""aria"" in which he encapsulates his view of life and the world, the happiness he has known here as a child in the Larina household and regrets his impetuousness as later does Onegin. But the duel takes place and Lenski is killed.
The most telling performance of this disc is the Onegin of Mariusz Kwiecien. His face, his whole body, his every word and action speaks of disdain and boredom with this ""country-life"" world he's in now with his uncle's estate that he's inherited. His lips and eyes give credence to his dialog in the post letter-scene encounter with Tanya. (This is an advantage of seeing the opera on disc as compared to in the opera house). Yet all of this veneer is utterly destroyed upon later meeting Tanya as Tatiana, now the refined lady, Princess Gremin. He is now disheveled and his worldliness crumbled away as he now is the pleading rejected one. Superb acting!
The other hero of this production is Gergiev and the Metropolitan Orchestra. They made it ""sing"" with a clear quiet voice. I've heard this opera dozens of times, often loud and slippery with pathos. No! It is fragile, delicate, clearly beautiful and introspective.
And that last scene as done here is really great drama.",1396915200,43,3145,4.834879406307977

6132897,1,B00H540KMM,"Recently I bought the dvd ""Eugene Onegin"" with Netrebko and because of Netrebko who has been a guarantee of supreme quality for the past several years.
But also knowing of the Metropolitan Opera's recent tricks and trends I bought a discount copy for 15 dollars, one third of which went to handling and  mailing.
Well , I do not know about handling and mailing, but for the contents of the disc I certainly paid too much.

As a preliminary warning I'll say that all the voices and their recording were excellent.
As to the production,  staging and acting ,  I would characterize them with the word bastardly.
It went like this:
Instead of a lawn before a country mansion the action begins inside what looks like a Florida room draped with second-hand, well used, Good Will sails for curtains. A platoon of very slavish looking Russian slaves (domestics) are feverishly working (the cause of the commotion is making preserves) in a Ford factory conveyor manner.
Then comes a mob of peasants, also very slavish looking Russian slaves, the size of an army company. They march in a crucession with big wooden crosses, gonfalons and other Orthodox church paraphernalia, priests and all. But this not a church service. They sing a lovely  - thank God - still Tchaikovsky's melody  which ends in a lively dance. The dance has its peculiarities of a NYC variety : a special stamping of feet resembling the omnipresent tap-dancing. One girl is being thrown by one bunch of hands to another bunch of hands, not raped but all ready to be raped, and the male dancers not raping but all ready to rape her. At least, that is the spirit of this authentic Russian dancing of the Metropolitan  opera brand.
In between there are some brief exchanges of Olga and Tatiana, Tatiana-Netrebko being 20-25 pound heavier than herself and looking like a full moon and like Olga after Pushkin. (Pushkin's description of Olga: """"In Olga's feature's there is no life just as in a Vandyke Madonna: she is round and fair of face as is that silly moon up in that silly sky."" Nabokov's translation.), and  the Metropolitan Olga looking like a 55 year old Middle-Eastern queen of Shemakha.  Pushkin's description of  the queen of Shemakha:

The non-Russians may omit reading this description.

The next scene is the arrival of two neighbors _Lensky and Onegin causing a still greater commotion of the slavish slaves and the hosts of the house. First appears Lensky, like a  Peeping Tom, peeping from under the sails. He is being trailed by Onegin. Both are similarly dressed in hunting clothes. Both look alike and later in the thoroughly darkened rooms and spaces it is difficult to identify who is who.  Together they strongly resemble a newly-wed gay couple.
Lensky grabs a tumbler with what looks like a Russian samogon (moonshine whiskey) and downs it repeatedly. ( A point on the eternal and universal Russian drunkenness.)

After the first lyric aria  ( in lieu of the copulation scene, nowadays obligatory but sadly missed  both by Tchaikovsky and by Pushkin) Lensky  grabs Olga and gives her a kiss of life in the presence of her mother and the slavish slave wet-nurse who has the face of a concentration camp female guard.  Simultaneously Tatiana drops an unidentified but very heavy object on the floor.
Onegin, after a few brisk critical remarks about country life, who, however, feels himself quite at home in this country estate,  makes for the staircase leading upstairs, and Tatiana, smitten by love, meekly follows him with an air of intention to commit another copulation scene, nowadays obligatory but sadly missed  both by Tchaikovsky and by Pushkin.

Then comes the letter scene.
In the bedroom still draped with the Good Will sails (in general, the classical sequence of  settings :  a lawn, a garden, a bed-room, a bench in the garden etc. - all this is too much for the Metropolitan Opera hell-bent on globalization and competitiveness :   of the opera takes place in the Florida room )  Tatiana sternly interrogates the slavish slave wet-nurse who has the face of a concentration camp female guard  about her wedding  of a century earlier and starts writing a love-letter to Onegin. Here Tatiana-Netrebko forgets that unlike  the previous performances when she was 20-25 pounds lighter rolling on the floor ""does not look too good nor sings too nice"". And she does both. My favorite opera diva sang the worst ""letter aria""  I have ever heard (And I heard about 120 performances of ""Evgenii Onegin"" in about 20-25 different productions.)

The next scene - after haggling loudly with the nurse Tatiana sends another slave with the letter to Onegin who promptly comes to the Florida room and  sternly lectures Tatiana on the unladylike behavior using the mannerisms of an Oklahoma sheriff.

Then comes another scene - Tatiana's name day .  Here we have a feast of an all-American grill party with children under the tables, the slavish slaves dancing together with the masters (slave-owners) apparently in the anticipation and premonition of the new democratic Russia of  200 years hence.

Triquet sings his Vi Rosa aria moving as if he fights  urges to defecate.

The 20 year-old Lensky with the prematurely aged face (from jealousy) of a 45 year old, starts a bar-room-like brawl with Onegin over the 55-year-old Olga and then rushes to a grim Russian forest to be killed by Onegin.
 Instead of the traditional duel pistols they hunt each other - after an unexpected (and unforeseen by Pushkin and Tchaikovsky) parting embrace and a kiss which do  re-enforce the earlier suspicion that they might be a gay newly-wed couple - with hunting rifles (confirming that all Russians are guerillas in their hearts of hearts).

The next scene is a ball in St. Petersburg represented by a dozen of white columns, four of which do look like columns in the Bolshoi Theater. Onegin places himself at the pilaster of one such column and begins to despise the society and to down one glass of  champaign after another. He never knows where to drop the empty glass and the lackeys do not notice him - so he prehends a bottle of champaign and drinks continuously until Tatiana's husband comes along and sings his aria in response to Onegin's enquiry as to who is over there with a framboise beret on.  There is no framboise beret on Tatiana - so the awkward - not to say the indiscrete - question of Pushkin about the beret - is aptly omitted in the translation  which is done several times in the opera  to hide the incongruities of  the libretto and  the Metropolitan's settings.

I nearly forgot to mention that in that St. Petersburg high society on the Metropolitan stage which Onegin despised there were Negroes and Negresses who, as is known, were a dime a dozen in high St Petersburg circles.
I would have written ""Afro-Americans"" but then, 200 years ago, ""Afro-Russians"" had not been yet naturalized in the USA and had been called simply Negroes.

The next scene is so reminiscent of the last  scene of ""Pique Dame"" that we cannot assert in all honesty that the director of this opera Fiona Shaw has never been to an opera before this one. She must have seen at least the end of  ""Pique Dame"" and the scene ""By the Winter Canal"" there. The Bolshoi Theater four columns come very handy here and look like the columns of the St. Isaak's Cathedral in St. Petersburg. In a very competitive manner.
Onegin declares eternal love to Tatiana, she returns the compliment - then they deep kiss each other in lieu of yet another copulation scene, sadly missed by Pushkin and Tchaikovsky, and Tatiana and Onegin run away in opposite directions.

This disc is a must-have as an example of the total degradation of our times and of the looming end of the opera art.",1396224000,28,7837,4.743494423791821

This is an opera that builds slowly. The famous music at the opening of Act II picks up the pace in scene one, and by scene two you are completely invested emotionally. Finally, the wallop that is Act III just blows you away. If you are new to ""Eugene Onegin"" this is a perfect place to start, and if you are a connoisseur you will surely appreciate this production.",1514592000,,629,4.616071428571429

There is already a fantastic DVD available from the Met with Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Renee Fleming, an excellent portrayal of the opera. But this one might be even better with the great Russian diva Anna Netrebko and Kwiecien, along with a great Lenski, Beczala. When I saw this performance in the theater, we all gasped at the end -- Tatyana gives Onegin a big luscious kiss -- and we all thought, 'are they changing the ending? Will Tatyana leave Gremin after all?' No, of course not. She was showing Onegin what he was going to miss in his life. Unfortunately, Gremin is sung poorly. It's a small role, but important. If the role is sung well, you realize that Tatyana has a real struggle. Both DVDs are very worthy and should be in your collection as a first choice. The only drawback is that Onegin was sung and acted even better by Mattei in the recent revival. Kwiecien, in comparison, almost fades into the scenery.",1492992000,,1022,4.590163934426229
