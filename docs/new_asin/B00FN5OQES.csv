8617101,5,B00FN5OQES,"Not sure what DVD the first reviewer was watching, but it couldn't have been this one.  This DVD very specifically covers various massage and acupuncture techniques and what these techniques are used for.  The movie then goes into no-touch healing methods that were absolutely incredible.  All of the techniques on the film aren't just explained, but they are demonstrated on real people.  I haven't even watched the end of the DVD yet.  Why not?  Because I'm still digesting all of the information from the first portion.  Conclusion: More than worth the money!",1426723200,,562,5.043478260869565
8617102,1,B00FN5OQES,"The seminar is a poorly done home video shot in some kind of storefront.  There is not a great deal of in depth information, and the demonstrations are not well done.  The exercises that are taught are minimal at best, and that is being generous.  As far a the Wild Goose Forms I did not see anything that would I would have called a teaching session.",1420675200,,351,4.287878787878788
