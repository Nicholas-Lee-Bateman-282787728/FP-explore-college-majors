6683006,5,B00NWIFZ02,"Great programs......just want more !  I am almost feeling 'sad' that I have now seen all of the Unit
One episodes.  They were all so so good....and all the actors, 'great' and the characters they played, everything was just 5 stars.  I cannot imagine that there is another episode...even if there was I would feel the same...Mads M  is 'famous' now....no wonder,  what a great great actor !  I've seen him in all
the films he's made but one and felt that too gory for me.  He's eye candy and sense of humor is unfailing. All the rest of the cast were new to me.  I liked all of them, each was/is,  special !
Keep it up Denmark - your films are the best, the very very best !",1433721600,,674,4.162790697674419
6683007,5,B00NWIFZ02,"This was the last year of the series.  It's sad to have such an excellent show stop.... however it has two episodes on the last disc from an aborted 4th season.  Unless they were planning to go forward with the series, those two episodes were better left off.",1430611200,3,259,4.375

6683012,5,B00NWIFZ02,"This is an outstanding series based on actual Danish cases.  The characters are very real! There is everything you would want: suspense, humor, reality, interesting scenery, and a conclusion at the end of each episode.",1425945600,,218,5.228571428571429
6683013,5,B00NWIFZ02,"This Danish cop show preceded the recent surge of Nordic crime shows (such as The Bridge & The Killing) that are now common place (and being copied) on US TV. This Series 3 completes the 2002 show which has 32 episodes in all. It follows a specialized team of Danish cops who are brought in to solve the countries toughest cases. US audiences will find much to like here as most episodes have a singular crime that gets 'solved' in the 58 min each episodes runs. You will have to navigate subtitles in the show, but the stories and the character development of the cops are well worth your time. The team is led by Ingrid Dahl the tough, but vulnerable Chief Inspector in charge. The cops lives change a lot over the course of the 32 episodes with divorce, marriage, personal tragedy & success in big doses along the way. Everyone is complicated, flawed, honorable, and exasperating here--just like the criminals they are chasing. My only criticism of the show is that the final episode will leave you...frustrated. Their is not a hint in the final show that it was scheduled to be the final show (maybe it wasn't) as nothing gets 'resolved'--it just stops. But don't let that deter you from getting this show because what you get is nearly 32 hours of excellent, intelligent, character driven cop show that eclipses 90% of what is on US TV.",1423440000,6,1341,4.591666666666667

6683031,5,B00NWIFZ02,"Love foreign detective dramas!  First class actors that do not make it look fake!!!  They don't have to have ""pretty faces"" in order to render a good job.  All American dramas, if they are not blond, shapely, good looking and with false eyelashes, they don't belong!  Love the good job as actors that foreign actors put into their work!  Love Danish, French and English tv series.  I hate to pay to watch them - but, frankly, it is soooo worthwhile!!!",1443657600,,451,4.575

6683034,4,B00NWIFZ02,"I edited this post because I misunderstood how the 32 episodes of Unit One have been packaged. The Series 1 DVD set contains episodes #1-12. The Season 2 DVD set contains episodes #13-24. The Season 3 DVD set contains episodes 25-32 (just 8 episodes). That's the entire 32 episode opus. The ""seasons"", as documented on IMDB and elsewhere, have Season 1 as ep1-9, Season 2 as ep10-16, Season 3 as ep17-30 and Season 4 as ep31-32. Don't ask me why the episode count per season varied as 9,8,13 and 2. That must be an odd feature of Danish TV. The POINT is the ""Season 4"" DVD set advertised here as part of the PAL format set contains the same episodes 25-32 as in the US-market Series 3 DVD set. Confusing? Yeah, a bit. Bottom line is do NOT do as I did: buy the PAL format ""Season 4"" DVD set thinking you're getting more new episodes because you are NOT. The 3 US-market DVD sets contain the complete 32-episode Unit One storyline.

This ""season"" (Seasons 3+4, based on the Danish organizing), while good, is not quite up to the quality established in the first two seasons. I get a vibe of American-style ""jumping the shark"" here, with episodes becoming implausible and overly melodramatic, to some extent. For example, the revelation that Ingrid is Wulf's daughter!? Fischer goes undercover IN PRISON for six months. Really? Does that really even happen anywhere? Johnny Olsen goes undercover with Fischer to infiltrate a deadly biker gang. REALLY? They've established repeatedly that Johnny is a FAMOUS and easily-recognized retired Danish soccer star. In previous episodes he gets recognized multiple times by ordinary people on the street. Not only is he entirely UNtrained to work undercover (being a truck driver and not a cop) his cover will be blown the first time a biker takes a close look at him. To top it off, HE HAS HIS NAME IMPRINTED ON THE TRUCK and at least a couple of times he's driving his truck during some of this undercover work. Come on, this kind of script-writing is very disappointing.

Overall, though, I have thoroughly enjoyed Unit One, to the extent that I have ordered the Region 2 4th DVD collection and will find a way to watch it. I will miss Unit One once I've watched the last episode.",1441065600,8,2222,4.665816326530612

6683036,5,B00NWIFZ02,"This series is masterfully done. The scripts, cinematography, and acting makes one admire the Danish TV/film industry. That a country with a small population can produce such consistent excellence is beyond admirable.
In ""The Unit"", an evolution occurs. The stories seem to become darker and turn toward the police/thriller genre and this makes them increasingly tense. All good things end---but, alas!",1439683200,,402,5.60655737704918
