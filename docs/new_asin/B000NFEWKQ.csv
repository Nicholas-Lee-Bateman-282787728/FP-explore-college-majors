8177559,3,B000NFEWKQ,"Vikram Bhatt is a director who hardly ever did a good film, and barring a few exceptions, most of his films are poor and unoriginal. But somehow I found Ankahee watchable despite the poor writing. The film deals with such issues as adultery and depression, and it might not be convincing, but somewhat enjoyable. Esha Deol stars as a beauty pageant who has an affair with a married man played by Aftab Shivdasani. First, with all due respect, Deol is far from having the looks of a beauty pageant. In fact, she is not half as beautiful as her mother Hema Malini. Having said that, she performed passionately throughout the film and her wide eyes conveyed the emptiness and the frustration of a woman suffering from manic depression. Aftab Shivdasani was decent as the confused man who lacks character. Amisha Patel was convincing and played the wronged but strong wife with sincerity and depth. This may be her most (or should I say only) solid performance since Gaddar. Technically, Ankahee is well-made. The story was quite good and the proceedings were dark and serious, albeit a bit confused and slow. The ending is strange and funny, but nevertheless, this is a decent fare which can be watched with family and friends.",1304035200,,1224,4.805687203791469
8177560,4,B000NFEWKQ,"Aftab's character is a doctor and Amisha Patel is his devoted wife.  Esha Deol is reigning Ms. World.  Aftab and Amisha Patel have been married for 8 years and have a young daughter. Then Esha Deol comes into Aftab's life and things begin to change.  Aftab did an ok job. He is unlikeable and portrays a jerk very well - if that is what he was trying to portray. Amisha Patel is effective, but it is annoying that she goes and gets all tough with Esha Deol even though she took marriage vows with Aftab and not Esha Deol. So why doesn't she yell at her husband instead of the outside woman?  Esha Deol was definitely the stand out performance. None of the songs really stuck out.  The movie is good to watch once.",1172188800,,713,4.291044776119403
