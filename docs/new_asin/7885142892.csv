1132964,5,7885142892,The storyline and action are really great. I don't want to give away too much information about this movie and ruin it for you but I definitely recommend this movie quite highly.,1329523200,,178,4.59375
1132965,5,7885142892,"if your a donnie yen fan... its a movie you gotta have... the movie overall was very good... don't want to give away too much but... but i watched it twice once i received it and it was awesome both times... it was just that good... video quality was very good... subtitles were spot on as well... action is great as always especially with donnie yen...

basic line what the movie is about... once a bad guy trying to live a good life... nosy cop trying to bring him in for his past crimes basically...

the down sides would probably be the price... a bit on the pricey side... and as well as shipping... envelope says it came from singapore... with no tracking number... and it took about three weeks to get to me... was a bit impatient... but i killed some time with other movies i purchased elsewhere... if i was to order another movie from these guys i might send it priority to myself next time...",1328486400,,902,4.363095238095238
1132966,5,7885142892,"I Really Liked this Movie a Lot!! This is Donnie Yen at his Best. I thought it was a clever Plot. I hope others do too. It told some(more than one) stories. It had More than One main character, and wove everything together. I don't want to give anything away so all I can say is Check it Out! Neat village, nice look at the ""workings of a peaceful small mountain clan""As a person Very interested in China at the turn of the last century, especially the transition from imperialism to The Peoples Republic, I enjoy most movies from this period, even when the history is ""enhanced""I did not feel that way about this tale, but perhaps more so in""Bodyguards and Assassins "",etc.,which I enjoyed Very Much. Donnie Yen, is SO Good. A likable guy, whether he is just an Ordinary Guy or the Toughest Guy  in the Region. The camera Work is Great, be sure and check out the Special features. (A Gag Reel would have been Cool!)Thanks for a great movie I really enjoyed, can't wait to share it with my family. It does have some rather violent fight scenes, so preview it first if your going to share with the younger/ squeamish set!",1327363200,,1120,4.436893203883495

1132970,5,7885142892,"This is Donnie's best movie since IP MAN. The martial arts is great, but what really sets this movie apart is the great story and arthouse style direction. Donnie's acting ability has improved by leaps and bounds in the last 5 years and this movie is the perfect vehicle for him to rise to the next level. This DVD from Media Asia/Mega Star is excellent. The picture is very sharp, and the subtitles are perfect. It played perfect on my USA player.",1318464000,2,448,4.475609756097561

Donnie's acting ability has gotten very very good. I think he'll end up with a better catalogue of work than either Jackie Chan or Jet Li. Unfortunately this DVD was horrible. The picture is soft, lacks any sort of detail and contrast, and has lots of pixelation. The subtitle track is poorly translated and not timed correctly.

1133303,5,7885142892,"Dragon was a very good stylized martial arts film, Donnie Yen showed off again, I love the epic fight sequences in the film, but personally hoped for more epic fight sequences like the four (2 in-the-house fights, 1 in the barn fight, and 1 public fight scene). The story line was will plotted and somewhat inspiring through the character Liu Jin-xi (Yen) desiring to leave his past tormenting lifestyle behind for the betterment of his new family and fighting for them through fighting his abusive corrupted father whom desired to take his son and train him to be a killer after Liu had no use to him because of chopping of his own arm to prove he wanted a peaceful and stable life.

1133413,4,7885142892,"First off, if you are interested at all in watching this film id advise you to skip this edited & cut US release & seek out the original 115min cut of the film under its original title Wu Xia. That said, the film is a different kind of martial arts film. Donnie Yen & Takeshi Kaneshiro are great in their roles. This movie is like an Asian version of A History of Violence. The main character is trying to settle down into a normal life after leaving behind a life of violence & his world comes crashing down after he tries to help some villagers. Kaneshiro plays a detective trying to uncover the truth behind the man who saved the villagers. The storyline is really good & keeps your interested through out the film as you also slowly find the answers to questions asked early on. The fight scenes as are usual for a Donnie yen film are once again well down but its the overall story & acting I feel shine. The ending is also very good & tragic in its own way. Highly recommended.",1426377600,2,982,4.28494623655914

1133734,4,7885142892,"Don't be fooled by the generic title, this movie is anything but generic. As my review title suggests, the film looks to have had a clear influence from the American movie ""A History of Violence"". The same premise of a man with a history of violence taking on a new identity to escape his past is used in both films.

One of the main differences between the films, aside from the obvious setting, is the detective and neo-noir element used in Dragon. Through the amazing cinematography we see a great scope of the world in Southern China, where a story is laid out in front of us, although it may not be exactly what it appears. This not an action movie but rather a well paced and well shot, story driven crime drama with kung-fu inspiration. The fight scenes in the film are intense and have been excellently choreographed.",1401062400,3,825,4.5369127516778525

1133739,5,7885142892,"I can't totally agree with you more, for this story is just superb. Reminds me of myself in a way, for my father was a gambler, boozer, and a womanizer, wrapped up in the corruption called Hollywood, where I have fought a titanic battle my entire life to not be like him after being a little boy while he slapped me around. Same thing goes for my grandfather, who did the same, where both of them are now deceased.

Takeshi was spectacular in this movie and crafted his part artfully.  We had seen in other movies but he was a fresh face with this one.  Really, the story is brilliant and I can't say anything to ruin it for you.  I did have to watch it again since you can miss subtle details that are important to the movie.

So we watched it again - we played it for my Chinese mother-in-law who is very, very snobby about English Chinese dubbed movies.  And she is extra haughty when it's one's she's never heard of and that we picked!  She really had to swallow her pride and say the movie was very good because she wanted to know the name and look at the case - LOL!

1133855,5,7885142892,"When I was young Martial Arts movies, then just called Kung Fu movies, were pretty simple. They were also cheesy. You watched them to see the fighting, the tricks and the stunts that western movies just couldn't do, not for the acting and certainly not for the story. As the decades have gone by these films have gotten sleeker and sharper. The action has become a real cinematic event that more than rivals the CGI explosions of Hollywoods biggest budgets. In modern Martial Arts films a few actors in a small room can create a breath taking ballet of action. However, this is not the only area in which these films have made improvements. They have become more clever. Their stories are better thought out, and played out. They have developed more complex aspects that their predecessors lacked. One such film that is an excellent example of the evolution of Martial Arts films is Dragon or Wu Xia.

 Wu Xia is a dark criminal investigation in to the true identity of a killer in early Twentieth Century China. The killer is a simple paper maker named Liu Jinxi, played by Martial Arts icon Donnie Yen. Liu Jinxi is married to Liu Yu, played by Tang Wei. He also has two sons, one adopted and one his own through his marriage. When some thugs enter the shop, in which Jinxi is replacing the paper on the windows, and begin beating the owners for money they owe, he takes action to defend them. At first it seems Jinxi gets lucky in his clumsy attack of the criminals as both end up dead by accident. Authorities are called in after the attack and a detective, Xu Baijiu, played by Takeshi Kaneshiro, just doesnt believe the simple paper makers account of the events. Similar to a 1940s Hollywood noir detective, who just cant let the case close, Baijiu follows Jinxi around for awhile and asks questions, observes him and even puts him through some tests. In the end Baijiu determines that Liu Jinxi is not who he says he is, he is in fact Tang Long, the son of the leader of a ruthless gang of murders know as the 72 Demons. Tang Long wanted redemption from his past crimes and wanted to start a new life where he could be a good man. Because of Baijius insistence on arresting Tang Long for his past crimes, the 72 Demons learn where he has been hiding for the last ten years and go to the village to bring him back to his father.

 First I would like to say that I loved the acting in this film. There was nothing overly dramatic, but the actors played their parts well. Yen played his character as a confused peasant at one point and a distraught man the next. Yen is an actor that I don't think gets his proper due from western audiences. Other Martial Arts actors like Jackie Chan and Jet Li get more press and recognition than Yen. Yet, Yen is a skilled actor as well as a Martial Artist. His direction of the fight sequences in this film are really intense and fun. Close quarters combat is the theme of the fights within Dragon and Yen does a marvelous job. Takeshi played a nerdy and persistent detective. He plays something like a fidgety Sherlock, who instead of injecting himself with cocaine is addicted to acupuncture techniques. His acupuncture skill is also the basis of his forensics knowledge, which makes him such a sharp detective. He also has conversations with himself, literally, for it seems like he is a little nuts. Baijiu has an internal struggle over the value of humanity and the value of law. He always wants to the law to triumph, and doesnt want to trust people, yet he has a deep compassionate side that always wants to intervene with inhumane laws. That side doesnt get to interfere that often however. This internal debate mirrors an on going struggle between the ancient philosophies of Kongzi (Confucius) and Han Fei-zi, the father of Legalism. This debate costed Baijiu his marriage, so it weights heavily on him. Then there is Jimmy Wang. Jimmy plays Tang Longs father and makes quite a terrifying gang leader. He has a commanding presence and a deep voice, like James Earl Jones, and he sounds demonic. While he is not seen much through out the movie he makes the film. You easily understand why Tang Long would run from such an abusive and evil person. On a side note, Jimmy Wang played the starring role in the 1967 Shaw Brothers production One-armed Swordsman, which Dragon (Wu Xia) plays tribute to near the end of the film.

 Second, the cinematography is stunning. Scenes are shot one way and then replayed differently as Baijiu discovers more of the truth. There are time controlled close ups and spinning angles, all of which brings the action close to the viewer. The background is lush southern China. So, the scenery takes on a dark wet, and wild look with compacted forests of green that are cut through with rushing rivers. The story moves from those untamed wilds outside the village that Liu Jinxi lives in and the village itself. The level of detail in the village is great, everything looks old and highly used. The colors of the clothes are drab and the wood of the buildings is black with age. This isn't a dirty place, but a comfortable, well lived in place. This film is not a plush and polished Kung Fu film, it is much closer to the earth, so to speak. I am not sure if these locations really exist, but knowing what I know of the ares in question they could be. I certainly hope they are. Even if they dont, they can be enjoyed in the film.

 Dragon (Wu Xia) is not a very long film. The story moves quickly, for it is meant to entertain. This is not a historical epic that needs at least two hours of explaining, like Red Cliff. However, this is not a non-stop face kicking film either. There are fight scenes but they don't dominate the screen time. This is a story driven Martial Arts film, which is another evolutionary development of the genre. The action becomes even more gripping and moving when the context is well established through a strong story, which Dragon has. The themes are deep, compassion vs. law, redemption vs. punishment, past actions vs current actions and which defines the person. All of this is brought together with amazing action scenes in engaging settings. Dragon is a must see for lovers of the genre, but like many modern Martial Arts films, it is an easy crossover to be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good story, especially one with a dark coating.",1390435200,3,6350,4.549431321084865

1134003,5,7885142892,"Great Martial Arts movie with a great plot. The idea of making Dragon reportedly started when Donnie Yen and Peter Chan were having a conversation and realised that both of them have a passion for the martial arts films of the 1960s and 1970s, especially One-Armed Swordsman (1967), the film directed by Chang Cheh that propelled actor Jimmy Wang (who played the titular protagonist) to stardom. Peter Chan explained that Dragon is a homage to One-Armed Swordsman, but not a remake or re-imagination in any form. The decision to have Donnie Yen's character lose an arm was confirmed after filming had started, and due to the fact that many people had the impression that Dragon was a remake of One-Armed Swordsman.",1381968000,,714,4.909090909090909

1134007,4,7885142892,"Dragon is another awesome film from Donnie Yen, and fans of his previous work, or martial arts films in general, are going to love this one.

Dragon tells the story of Liu Jinxi(played by Yen), a quiet villager who mysteriously rolled into town ten years ago who may be much more than he appears to be. An incident in which two robbers are killed by Jinxi brings the notice of an obsessive inspector Xu Baijiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who is determined to reveal what he believes to be the truth.

Yen brings the same depth and intensity, if not just a tad bit more, to Jinxi that he brings to any of his roles. He just seems to get better with every movie he makes. Takeshi Kaneshiro nearly steals the show from him as well, playing the near insanity of his character with spellbinding perfection. Even if the story wasn't so interesting, I would probably give the film very high marks for their brilliant performances alone.

There is not as much wall to wall action as some of Yen's other films, but there is still plenty of it and it is some of his hardest hitting yet. It's shot beautifully, and the choreography does the wonderful trick of keeping in mind the established personalities of the characters fighting.

The only reason I don't give this a full 5 star mark is that the story begins extremely strongly in the first half, but gets a little loose in the second half once the action begins, which as expected as that may be, is still a bit disapponting. However, it's still a solid film overall so this is really more a 4 1/2 out of 5.",1379548800,,1543,4.4416961130742045

1134113,4,7885142892,"Filmmaker Peter Chan (""The Warlords"", ""Perhaps Love"", ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story"") and writer Oi Wah Lam (""Purple Storm"", ""Perhaps Love"" and ""The Warlords) are best known for their film collaborations in Hong Kong.

And the two return with their exciting, action-packed martial arts film ""Dragon"" (""Wu-Xia"") starring Donnie Yen (""Ip Man"", ""Hero"", ""Iron Monkey""), Takeshi Kaneshiro (""Chungking Express"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Red Cliff"") and Wei Tang (""Lust, Caution"", ""Man-Choo"", ""Finding Mr. Right"").

The film was nominated for eleven Hong Kong Film Awards and won two awards for ""Best Cinematography"" and ""Best Original Score"" and did very well in the Chinese box office grossing over 100 million yuan on opening week.

VIDEO:

""Dragon"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and presented in 2:35:1.  While picture quality is very good, with lush surroundings and very good set design to capture China ala 1917.  What captures your attention throughout the film is the choreographed fighting.  Both Yiu-Fai Lai and Jake Pollock did a magnificent job of capturing the fight scenes, and the use of CG to give the feeling that the location of where the film was shot is near the cliffs and waterfall, the combination of real scenery and green screen was used effectively.

Close-ups of characters show plenty of detail and black levels are nice and deep.  For the most part, picture quality is very good for the film!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Dragon"" is presented in Mandarin Chinese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  While the film benefits from its action and the breaking of wood to people being thrown all over the place, the film's lossless soundtrack can be summed up with clear dialogue, beautiful musical score from Kwong Wing Chan, Peter Kam and Chatchai Pongpraphan and crowd ambiance.  For the most part, the lossless soundtrack was very good, not very immersive but yet appropriate for this film.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Dragon"" comes with the following special features:

  The Making of Dragon - (22:27) Risks and Rewards, Framing the Action, Choosing Jimmy Wang Yu, A Different Role for Takeshi Kaneshiro, The Ins and Outs of Acupuncture, Family Dynamics, Tang Wei in the Countryside, Wai Ying Hung on Working with Donnie Yen.
  Featurette with Donnie Yen - (5:40) Featuring three featurettes featuring Donnie Yen: Staging the Action, Influences and Inspiration and On Set, On Location.
  ""Lost in Jianghu"" Music Video - (5:14) Music video for ""Lost in Jianghu"", theme of ""Dragon"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Asian cinema, the fact is that filmmaker Peter Chan has worked on some major films from ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story"", ""The Warlords"" and ""Perhaps Love"", producers know they are getting a director who has consecutively led to box office hits.

And part of that is due to Peter Chan managing to land the top stars of Asia in his films.  And with ""Dragon"", it's no different.  Box office hit in China and you have two of the top Asian talents starring in the film, Donnie Yen and Takeshi Kaneshiro.

Donnie Yen is a staple of martial arts films especially in the last few years, after seeing ""Ip Man"", you can't see him doing anything less than that.  And what I like about Donnie Yen's involvement in a film is that he pushes for amazing fight choreography and does not take on martial arts films that are weak when it comes to fighting.  And like his previous ""Ip Man"" films, ""Dragon"" showcases that fantastic flair of fight choreography at the highest level.

As for Takeshi Kaneshiro, you have one of the best dramatic actors.  He may not be a martial arts fighter but he makes it up in the more dramatic scenes.  In this case, an investigator who knows there is more to Liu Jinxi (portrayed by Donnie Yen) that meets the eye.  A relentless investigator seeking out the truth, the things he does in order to prove Liu Jinxi wrong, definitely is surprising as he intentionally pushes Liu off a bridge or sticks a sickle on his shoulder.

You also get actress Wei Tang who took a risk in Ang Lee's 2007 film ""Lust, Caution"" and as a result for participating in the film, she was blacklisted by the Chinese government and losing endorsement deals.  Despite being 34-years of age, she still manages to look very young on camera.  But she provides another dramatic angle as a wife who wants to stick by her husband and hopes he doesn't abandon the children, when his past life is revealed.

As for the Blu-ray release, while picture quality and the lossless soundtrack are very good.  You also get a good amount of special features which I'm happy to see included on this Blu-ray release (as many Asian films released in the USA tend to skimp on special features).

While I enjoyed ""Dragon"" for being one of the enjoyable martial arts films I have seen so far in 2013, having watched so many Peter Chan, Donnie Yen and Takeshi Kaneshiro films, it's hard for me to say this is their best film.  Enjoyable...yes.  Awesome fight choreography...yes.  But an engaging storyline?  If anything, it was a bit more of a popcorn action martial arts film and nothing more or less than that.

The film tries to explain the deep hate that Liu Jin-xi has towards his father, but it would have been great to establish visually of why we should despite his father and helping set up this amazing confrontation between father and estranged son.  Also, the film ends with somewhat of uncertainty.

Overall, ""Dragon"" is an exciting martial arts film with amazing fight choreography!  While I have seen better Peter Chan, Donnie Yen and Takeshi Kaneshiro films, there is no doubt that martial arts action film fans will enjoy ""Dragon"".  It's definitely one of the better martial arts films I have seen on video released in 2013 so far!

Kind of like CSI type movie, it is interesting how the Chinese view movie making these days. They have the sense of drama, the music for sure, and their acting is not too shabby. The problems is that the formula wears out rather fast. In a constant desire to find the next Jet Lee, or harder still, Bruce Lee, I keep watching this martial arts type movie.
The scenes are so grossly exaggerated, one has to have lots of tolerance by the end of the movie. Suddenly they are flying through rooftops, shattering whatever credibility has existed, and it makes it look so naturally one wonders if it is possible, knowing how the camera can pull tricks so easily.

As far as I know - and I may be wrong - it didn't happen, and lovers of great movies missed out on an overpowering one. ""Dragon"" delivers in every sense possible, cinematically speaking. It is one intelligent detective drama, with amazing martial arts infused in it.

The film star is the one and only Donnie Yen - my favorite martial arts actor these days - as Liu Jin-Xi, a worker at a paper mill on small and picturesque town in Yunnan, ""at the southwestern edge of China."" It is 1917 and we find him at the beginning of the movie, just waking up and getting ready to go to work, having some quality time with Ah Yu (Wei Tang), his wife, and their two small children. They live a simple life in a cozy cabin. One day, while at work, two thieves show up at the paper mill, and demand money from the owner. The owner and his wife try to fight the robbers, with no success. Liu Jin-Xi hides from the thugs and tries to stay safe, but sooner and later gets involved in the action and, in his own way, also fights the delinquents. Eventually, he beats and kills them. He is celebrated as a hero in town, and remains humble at all times.

Some time later, the police arrive to the town and begin an investigation. Everything is going well, but Detective Xu-Bai-Jiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) doesn't buy the official story. He believes that Liu Jin-Xi is not who he claims to be, because the two thieves that he killed where two of the most dangerous and skilled criminals sought by the justice in those parts. He decides to stay in town to further investigate Liu Jin-Xi, convinced that he is Tang Long, the second in command of the 72 Demons gang, one of the most ferocious gangs in the region. Liu Jin-Xi denies it, but Detective Xu-Bai-Jiu doesn't give up, his belief being that ""only physiology and the law don't lie,"" and that ""men are just stinking sacks of fluids with no redeeming qualities."" His obsession with Liu Jin-Xi will open a Pandora's Box that will alter the peace of this little town ""at the southwestern edge of China.""

Directed by Peter Ho-Sun Chan, ""Dragon"" will have you to the edge of your seat until the very end. It smart, colorful, and with awesome fights coordinated by Donnie Yen himself. This is great entertainment, the one that doesn't come from the repetitive minds of Hollywood. The Blu-ray includes a making of documentary, featurettes with Donnie Yen, and more.

1134532,5,7885142892,"Don't let the simple title of this film fool you:  this is not a simplistic movie, nor does it deal with a scaly creature that breathes fire.  In reality, this film is SO much more.  Part action flick and part mystery, DRAGON ensnares you from the opening sequence and never lets go.  With mind-bending fight scenes and an enthralling enigma, this is one film that you will not want to miss.

I have to confess that I liked DRAGON more than I was expecting to.  Much more, in fact.  I figured, after reading the plot synopsis, that I was going to enjoy it, but wow...it almost blew me away.  The fight scenes are intense and unique, the plot is paced well and unravels the mystery perfectly, and the acting is great as well.  You really can't ask for much else.

Donnie Yen, the actor that portrays the main character, is a phenomenal talent on-screen and I always enjoy his work.  In this particular role, we get to see his versatility as an actor; one minute he plays a daft paper-mill worker in the small village, but the next he's playing a cool, calculating assassin.  It's truly inspiring to see his ability to shift gears like this.

DRAGON is shot very well and the action scenes are top-notch.  But the story is what really wins the mark.  There's plenty of intrigue and emotional drama in this film, but it never bogs down.  The pacing is perfect and the answer to the mystery of Liu's background unfolds just as it should.

I highly recommend giving DRAGON a look.  This film has a little something for everyone.  If you like martial arts action, you're in for a real treat; Donnie Yen choreographed the fight scenes, so they're filled with adrenaline-fueled mayhem.  And you if you enjoy a mystery, there's enough intrigue here to make Sherlock Holmes proud.  Do yourself a favor and check this one out for sure.",1366588800,,1824,4.550769230769231

I thought it would be prudent to post this disclaimer on Amazon as it directly effected my decision to NOT buy this version of this movie.

THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION, but rather one that has been edited and shortened by the American Studio handling the domestic release.
Also, changes have been made to some of the music as well.

Now, I'm sure some people don't care about this sort of thing, and you who don't will get an acceptable movie if you decide to buy this. Personally I am a bit of a purist and get offended when some Suits who had nothing to do with making a movie suddenly start cutting bits out and generally messing it about.

That is all, and may you get much enjoyment out of this film in whatever form you acquire it.

*Unhelpful side note for the curious*:
I am also annoyed by the rebranding of this film as ""Dragon.""""Wu Xia"" is the term for the sub-genre of story telling that this film is an example of. Hence, renaming it ""dragon"" is like renaming a Film Noir titled ""Noir"" to ""Black"" for a foreign release, which doesn't make any sense and is stupid. :p",1366156800,120,1450,5.046025104602511
1134535,5,7885142892,"I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of Dragon to review and below are my thoughts.  This review does contain some spoilers.

Dragon is an action packed martial arts film mixed in with a little science and mystery, which makes for an interesting film.

When the movie starts, we can see that there is a bit of mysticism as we get to see the beautiful landscape.  Taking place in the early 20th Century, Jin-xi (Donnie Yen) is a papermaker working at a general store.  Two gangsters come into the store and start to rob the place; however, Jin-xi, who was initially in hiding, comes out and starts to fight the robbers.  The fight didn't look too special, it looked like a struggle, like most normal fights would, and he finally kills both robbers and he is hailed as a hero in the village.

Xu Bai-jiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) comes to town to investigate the crime scene.  It turns out one of the gangsters that Jin-xi killed was a notorious criminal who had escaped from prison and he was a highly trained killer.  Xu has his suspicions as to how a simple papermaker could kill a convict with such skill.  As Xu interviews the people throughout the village and Jin-xi's family, he finds out that Jin-xi showed up out of nowhere roughly five years prior.  Jin-xi's wife said that he had a fight with his family and he ran away from home.

Xu finally gets the chance to interrogate Jin-xi to get his side of the story as to what happened and how the fight transpired.  As Jin-xi is describing how he fought the two robbers, Xu has a different picture in his head of how the fight went down and we see a completely different scene of the same fight and how Jin-xi was really able to defeat the two men.  It appears Jin-xi was fighting in somewhat of a supernatural way and he eventually summoned ""Qi"" energy (a life force, energy flow, or life energy) and was ready to kill.

After Xu finds out about Jin-xi's supernatural abilities, he performs a little test on Jin-xi by pushing him over a bridge.  Jin-xi falls on some really small branches, which should have broken, but he hangs there for a bit before dropping into the water.  Xu concludes, with a little bit of science, that Jin-xi is able to, essentially, defy gravity.  This gives Xu even more confirmation that Jin-xi is not really the person he claims to be.  After investigating a bit Xu talks to Jin-xi again and Jin-xi confesses that he was a convicted murderer and had spent time in prison, but got out because of an amnesty.  He claimed that his father, a butcher, made him kill a man who owed them money.  After hearing this, Xu doesn't believe Jin-xi because he sees that his Qi energy is repelling flies, so he takes a sharp object, a sickle, and attacks Jin-xi with it thinking it would not cut him.  Xu was right, although the sickle cut Jin-xi a bit, it didn't cut him as it would have a normal person.

Xu eventually finds out that Jin-xi is actually Tang Long who was second-in-command of the notorious criminals, the 72 Demons.  It turns out that Jin-xi actually killed a family of butchers and he was never a butcher's son.  After finding this out, Xu seems to be somewhat scared of Jin-xi now and he goes to Feng County to get an arrest warrant.

The master of the 72 Demons, Jin-xi's father, wants him back, so he sends some people to go get him.  As the 72 Demons members arrive in the village, Jin-xi is being awarded an award of integrity, so all the people are there to watch.  Jin-xi, defiant to not go back to the 72 Demons, fights the people sent for him.  At this point, the people in the village, and even Jin-xi's wife, get to see his supernatural fighting skills.  This is how Jin-xi's wife finds out that he is really not who he says he is.  After some excellent fighting sequences, Jin-xi finally defeats the people who were after him.

Xu, finally realizing that Jin-xi does not want to be a member of the 72 Demons, eventually decides to help Jin-xi try to get out.  They both come up with a scheme to make the 72 Demons think that Jin-xi is dead; however, that is foiled.  In order to get out, Jin-xi cuts off his arm in front of the 72 Demons and tells them that he is done with their group.  The 72 Demons finally leave and Jin-xi goes home only to find his father there with his family.  Jin-xi fights his father because his father tried to kill his son when he found out that Jin-xi wanted out of the 72 Demons.  Xu helps Jin-xi with the fight and he dies in the process.  Jin-xi's father finally dies from a strike of lightning and, at this point, Jin-xi knows that he can finally live in peace with his family.

Overall, Dragon is an excellent movie with some great fight sequences and cinematography.  It is not too often that you come across a movie that moves you both physically and emotionally at the same time and Dragon does just that.  In my opinion, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and I strongly suggest this movie to almost anyone as this is a must have for any movie collection.  It's very rare I do this, but I give this movie a 5/5 stars.  I enjoyed the fight scenes, the characters were excellent in their roles, and the beauty of the landscape captured on film is almost unmatched.

1134660,5,7885142892,"Great movie! After Bruce Lee's death, I remember thinking I would never see anything like him again. Donnie Yen comes close- very close! His fighting style is different, especially with regards to his facial expressions. I know that seems like a strange comparison, but it's true. Bruce Lee, while fighting, looked like a man filled with rage- an unbridled energy and force of nature. Donnie Yen fights with an expression of perfect peace- fully aware of everything that surrounds him, and in total control... of everything. For me, where they are alike is in the lightning speed they both posses. I know- this is cinema and anything can be faked- but I don't believe this is. Mr. Yen uses more wire work than Mr. Lee did, but it's the up close fighting that takes your breath away- then and now. I cannot do justice to the pure brilliance of these two men, separated by 40 years. And what about the movie itself? I thoroughly enjoyed it- start to finish. The detective, who analyzes the death of two thugs at the hands of Mr. Yen, gives a interesting angle to the script that I haven't seen before. There is much more going on during the opening fight scene than you might think! The storyline expands nicely and kept my interest throughout. The scenery is gorgeous- thank you Blu-ray!

Especially one old guy who shows up later in the film, you might recognize him even though he is much older and heavier than in his heyday. In that recognition there is homage to some of the old Shaw Brothers stuff, I won't spoil it but we are talking real martial arts film history stuff.

It's worth the extra money.  So now on to the film itself... Donnie Yen plays Jinxi, a quiet, well respected family man in a small village.  One day he stops a burglary, killing two dangerous criminals in the process accidentally-- or was it?  Police detective Xu Bai(played in quirky fashion as only Takeshi Kaneshiro can) is on the case, and unwilling to believe there isn't more to Jinxi than he lets' on.  Director Peter Chan shows no lag coming off the enjoyable Warlords, only this time he's traded action star Jet Li in for Donnie Yen-- and Donnie brings his A game!  Astonishing as a performer in his own action direction is a given, but Yen showcases some real acting skill in the more quiet moments of the movie, which hasn't always been the case(but the action is always so good you can look past some stiff deliveries).  As a martial arts enthusiast I may be rating this a little high, it's a slower film with plenty of buildup, although the payoff is there(including a fantastic ode to the Chang Cheh classic The One-Armed Swordsman).

This film's storyline is artfully crafted and put me on the edge of my seat then kicked me out of it, repeatedly, it was so good. The fight scenes were fantastic and action-packed with moves that are a thing of beauty. If you are a fan of Donnie Yen (as I am) or love a great martial arts movie (as I do) with unpredictable twists, then you have to see this.

Takeshi Kaneshiro expertly portrays an intuitive and reflective law enforcement officer (Xu Baijiu) on a quest for truth, and you have to watch this to see if the truth set him free. With great skill and grace, Donnie Yen masterfully plays Liu Jinxi, a multi-faceted character with an abiding desire for peace, but who is thrust into circumstances that put that desire at risk. His beautiful wife, Ayu, (actress, Tang Wei), plays a gentle and vulnerable character with a painful past that tenderly compels you care about her well-being.

While the ending might be controversial to some, it is important to remember that at one point in the movie, Liu discusses his view of karma with Xu...For me, everything ties together neatly at the end and is a movie that I plan on adding to my martial arts collection.

It seems that all the reviews for all versions of this movie are appearing for all listings on Amazon so I thought I'd clear some things up.
Long story short, the Uncut Foil Cover Edition is the studio released version and it is excellent quality. Nothing questionable about it.

The resolution is better than the theater and Amazon Istant version. The audio options are Mandarin and Cantonese. There are English subtitles. This is how I like to watch my kung fu...original language with English subs. Audio and video are all top notch. I bought the DVD over the Blu-Ray because the DVD was shipped by Amazon and the Blu-Ray was going to ship from Hong Kong. I couldn't wait that long. I recently watched the movie at the theater and then a couple days later on Amazon Instant Video. I really enjoyed it for the cinematography, the score, the acting, and the action, but when I got the DVD in the mail, I watched it that night and the quality was so much better than even watching at the theater...plus, it is the uncut edition. If you watched at the theater or on Amazon and you liked it, you will love this version. There is so much more depth to the story. I was so pleased. It's too bad the version available through Amazon Instant is not the uncut version. It is such a richer story and I'm sure if the uncut version is what was on offer to the general public here stateside, it would garner far more attention. The bar has been raised. Taking plot cues from A History of Violence while referencing a Hong Kong classic The One-Armed Swordsman, this movie feels timeless with little kitsch. There are modern stylistic devices that remind me of Fight Club and Snatch, a vintage quality soundtrack, clever storytelling, and Donnie Yen and Takeshi Kaneshiro both deliver quality, quality performances.",1357084800,3,1911,4.6371681415929205

Pretty awesome action scenes ... some pretty interesting detective sequences (almost Sherlock BBC esque - not that CBS Elementary bullcrap) ...  but a very anti climatic ending.  Doesn't ruin the movie but it'll definitely maybe cause a ""What?  Really?!"" moment.

1135720,4,7885142892,"The opening credits have style bleed from every frame of film as you see the unusual patterns blood makes in other liquid and various different shots of the bloodstream and the nerves inside the body. Donnie Yen's first big action sequence is eye catching because it isn't what you're used to seeing from the Hong Kong action star. He seems to be doing nothing more than resisting his opponents and using their weight to his advantage. It's similar to how Jackie Chan fights (or doesn't fight) in ""Little Big Soldier."" The method in which Xu Baijiu analyzes crime scenes is really spectacular because the use of physiology is really outstanding. He mentally dissects everything that happens as Liu explains the events at the store. Compare it to how Sherlock Holmes mentally analyzed things in Guy Ritchie's version of ""Sherlock Holmes."" You see how the events actually occurred and everything slows down while Xu gets a closer look.

Donnie Yen dives into some pretty dark territory here. The tales about his father, the horse he used to own, and how he was a convicted murderer is the complete opposite of the inspectors and revolutionaries he's portrayed in the past. Yen's acting is so believable though. He always has this smile on his face that's usually accompanied by nervous eye movements or a slight trembling in the rest of his body that seems to hint at him hiding something. He's on the verge of tears on more than one occasion and you can feel the rising tension between him and Xu Baijiu. When the eyes of an actor are able to the story of a film better than words ever could, you know you're in for something special.

Takeshi Kaneshiro's performance is also extremely polished. He portrays a man that has been robbed of just about everything he believed in. He was on the brink of death at one point in his life and was never fully able to recover from that. The only thing he has left is enforcing the law. His obsession with Liu Jinxi comes off as unhealthy and kind of fruitless, but it also results in some of the most memorable scenes in the film. Xu fails to see that his mission for justice is costing the lives of everyone around him. Kaneshiro does an impeccable job of portraying a broken man clinging to life by a single thread.

The last 20 minutes of ""Dragon"" take you completely by surprise. The conclusion of the last fight will make or break your opinion of the film. ""Dragon"" feels smarter than the average martial arts film thanks to the Xu Baijiu character being so into acupuncture and physiology. There's an emphasis on nerve endings and pressure points that is slightly reminiscent of ""Fist of the North Star"" as Donnie Yen actually shows several different emotions and delivers one of his finest performances to date while Takeshi Kaneshiro's impressive performance will be left imprinted in your mind. Unfortunately, this version of the film is at least 14 minutes shorter than the foreign release of the film. Nevertheless, ""Dragon"" delivers a few swift kicks and a barrage of bone crunching punches to the standard expectations of a remake. ""Dragon"" is a stunning display of martial arts action, mesmerizing detective work, and engaging performances.",1354320000,2,3193,4.791288566243194

1135722,4,7885142892,"WARNING! Many spoilers below! This is more a review for people who want to think about what they have already seen.
This is largely a remake of David Cronenberg's 2005 film, A History of Violence. But with some major changes in emphasis. Cronenberg's film is a meditation on the thin line between the action hero and the sociopath. Dragon reflects on the possibility of redemption and where to draw the line between mercy and justice.
Consider the situation of the two families at the ends of their respective films. Cronenberg's Stall family have no idea if they can put their lives together again, their whole sense of stability having been shattered by the events of the movie.  Chan's film ends with a sense of healing and hope.

Cronenberg's is the better film. The story is beautifully told and the theme strikes me (enter Personal Opinion) as the deeper theme. Dragon has some major plot holes. For example, toward the end Yen's character is confronted by a group of twenty or so bad guys who then send him off to fight their master.  After the defeat of the master, the twenty bad guys apparently decide to retire off screen somewhere. Maybe in a monastery?
And I have some issues with the whole Iron Bell(or whatever variation he uses) chi defense the master uses. It is about time that Wu Xia movies give up the whole skin that cannot be penetrated or sliced by a sharp sword schtick. It didn't work very well in the Boxer Rebellion and it doesn't really work in the movies.

On the other hand, you have some beautiful acting by the three main principals and Donnie Yen doing his usual incredible movie fighting.

1135841,5,7885142892,"This film presents a new approach to telling martial arts stories. It's blend of comedy, thriller, and of course action. The first half is a detective story, reminding me of many a Sherlock Holmes but also with a tinge of Rashomon and Hero! The action gets intense, but not unnecessarily so, in the second half, and the film is very well paced and told, and also beautifull shot. Donnie Yen still can't really act but he's getting better and better; Kaneshiro, the mixed-nationality actor, shines once again. The supporting actors all do a surprisingly fine job, too! This is a martial arts movie worth seeing, again and again! It's not your typical kung fu film, but one with a certain degree of depth and true style.",1352505600,3,718,4.7063492063492065

While there is some weaknesses with parts of the story as in don't tell me but show me, all in all the overall arc of the storyline and the tension between the detective and paper maker is great. Very much a graphic novel sort of movie with a good story but not necessarily very deep. It starts to breakdown in the third act with some non-sensical theatrics, but not so bad that it become unwatchable.

You could probably wait for a less expensive rental, but if you're looking for a good popcorn movie, this is a good choice. I especially like the tension between the detective and the papermaker. There's some really great scenes here and the movie is beautifully filmed. A solid movie and worth a rental.",1352505600,,760,4.588235294117647

He has been around as long as Jet Li, but Yen seems to have a yen (excuse me) for making movies wit greater substance than Li. And I am a huge Li fan, so I say that with much respect. Li may well possess superior wu shu skills, but Yen is most incredible for his age and he possesses, in my opinion, far better acting skills. He tends to act in movies with very strong moral messages that are not evident in the Li films. HERO was great because both men appear together. I wish they would make more movies together. This is a MUST SEE, MUST OWN!!

Donnie Yen is an awesome fighter and the scenes where he fights (except the really lame first scene -- though the later twist on that scene is interesting) are everything you would expect if you saw the Ip Man movies.

The problem with Dragon though is that it tries to be more of detective movie with more story and less action, and it doesn't succeed at that goal.  Perhaps the story is a little better than average for a martial arts movie, but it's not like the story is actually compelling on its own -- take out the fighting and few people would watch this movie.  So what you end up with is a C+ story and A+ action, but far too little action.

Bottom line:  This movie will be worth $1 when it comes to Redbox or $3 or $4 at Amazon after it has appeared in U.S. theaters, but it's not worth seeing in the theater or renting online for more than $3 or $4.",1351728000,5,1089,4.1571428571428575

I look at the movie as 3 acts, the first being a strong character build up, the second a climactic reveal of character, then a bit of a throw back to other martial arts over the top standards that kind of mars the story a bit for me. But in the end the overall effect of the movie is satisfying and quite poetic. The cinematography is great with some visual stylings we've seen in other films but used to good effect to give story and almost film noir quality.

1136045,4,7885142892,"[THIS IS A REVIEW ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF, NOT THE QUALITY OF DVD]

Set in a 1917 small village in Yunnan Province, ""Wu Xia"" follows a story of Liu Jinxi (Donnie Yen, ""Ip Man""), an ordinary worker with his wife Ayu (Tang Wei, ""Lust, Caution"") and two sons. To investigate the deaths of two bandits robbing the local shop, Xu Baijiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro, ""Red Cliff""), a detective with a strong sense of justice, is sent to the village, where he meets mild-mannered Liu Jinxi. Being an expert of physiology, the detective suspects that a peaceful family man Liu Jinxi is not what he appears.

As the title says, ""Wu Xia"" is a Chinese martial arts film, of which story resembles that of ""History of Violence"" or ""Reign of Assassins."" Director Peter Chan (""Warlords"") gives a twist to the film's plotline, of which first half features ""Rashomon""-like inquiry into truth by detective Xu Baijiu, visually re-enacting what really happened to the dead robbers. Donnie Yen and Kenji Tanigaki deliver solid action stunts, though a bit too brief.

Two veteran actors (I will mention later again) arrive in the second half, and the film becomes more conventional in storytelling, leaning more on the action side. That does not mean the story is predictable, however. Kaneshiro's character steps aside, letting Donnie Yen's reluctant hero do what he can do. And he does it brilliantly.

""Wu Xia"" is notable for casting two seasoned players working from the days of the Shaw Brothers studio. Yu Wang, the hero of ""The One-Armed Swordsman"" (1967), makes his first on-screen appearance in 18 years as charismatic ""Master,"" fighting another one-armed warrior here. Kara Hui, heroine of Shaw Brothers' ""My Young Auntie"" (1981) is also impressive in the intense martial arts fight scenes with Donnie Yen.

Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find interesting Kaneshiro's character, mostly sidelined in the second half of the film, perhaps because I wanted Donnie Yen action, not a psychological drama. After all, the film is ""Wu Xia"" and it delivers goods, but some viewers may feel differently, who want more of the film's Sherlock Holmes-like detective.",1334966400,,2129,5.036931818181818
1136046,3,7885142892,"While I enjoyed this movie, I was unhappy with the captioning because it was missing in several places on my dvd.  Therefore, I missed some dialogue of the characters and I was left to wonder what their messages were.

Also, one caption, in particular, the one wherein Donnie Yen's four year old son said, ""Father, my tooth hurts like hell"", I thought was inappropriate for the movie.  I can't believe a four year old would speak in such a manner to his father, especially a four year old living in that period.

All-in-all I thought the acting of the main characters was good.",1334102400,,577,4.572815533980583

An absolutely unintelligible plot...and who exactly is our main character?  Occasionally it's Donnie Yen, sometimes it's the detective.

7900339,5,7885142892,"Dragon is a perfect example of the rising popularity of Chinese cinema - clearly receiving more funds, more know-how, more talent, etc., than has ever been seen.  Donnie Yen is fantastic in his role, as is usually the case.  But what really lends to this film is the quality of direction provided by Peter Ho-Sun Chan and supporting cast.  Takeshi Kaneshiro, for example, provides a stellar performance in his pursuit of justice accordingly to the most idealistic understanding of the law.

The film definitely plays around with the visualized ""facts,"" just as the characters in the film converse with blurred facts as to past events.  This leaves an ambiguity that opens up interpretation, discussion as to what was real and what was not.  It also serves as an interesting counterpoint to Kaneshiro's unflinching view of people and the law.

Dragon is a well thought-out film, with superb visuals and a strong cast.  This is a Martial Arts film at it's core, but it is elevated well above the standard.  Dragon is definitely worth a viewing for Martial Arts fans and even mystery-crime-thriller genre fans.",1506124800,,1107,4.9728260869565215
