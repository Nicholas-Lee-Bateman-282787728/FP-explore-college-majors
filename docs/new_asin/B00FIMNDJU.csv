8615947,5,B00FIMNDJU,"An excellent introduction to the land, heritage, and iconic shepherds' dogs that are so much a part of Scotland's Border region.  Focusing also on the lore, heritage, and a love of this land, Frae the Cradle is a worthy introductory volume in what the producers promise will be a Tweedhope Sheepdogs trilogy of DVDs.  Born is a litter of pups destined to follow in the demanding paw prints of a century or more of ""hill dog"" ancesters.  This viewer felt this introduction was almost like a love letter to the Border region and the shepherds' dogs whose name pays tribute to the area.  I am eager to see the next DVD.  It should, if as described, follow a group of pups from the litter introduced in this DVD, through months of developing their sheep herding skills.  I'd recommend this DVD not only to Border collie enthusiasts but to any interested in the beautiful part of this world known as the Scottish Borders.",1399075200,2,916,4.6234567901234565
8615948,2,B00FIMNDJU,"Expected to learn more of how the sheep dog is crafted and guided to use it's instinct .  Instead was a video of scenic views, farm videos and video of historic markers.  With video now and again of the puppies.  Video looked to be hand held.  Music was fine.  Not what I expected.",1391990400,,281,4.226415094339623
