I just like the sub plot of what a pretty face will make people do... But you'll have to see the movie to find out. I rented this movie from the video store before I bought it.",990576000,,395,4.142857142857143
1389778,5,B000053V7I,"I rented Crime + Punishment in Suburbia expecting another 3rd rate, just rent it once, not so great movie....and instead I found a captivating, enthralling masterpiece.  I got on Amazon and bought it the same day I saw it.  The movie deserved more attention than it got.  Monica Keena and Vincent Kartheiser are mesmerizing. James DeBello impressed me.  I noticed in the other reviews that no one mentioned the eternally underestimated Michael Ironside, who does a wonderful job of switching gears from the powerful guy everyone fears to the dopey guy that everyone walks on.  And even though you aren't supposed to like his character, he makes you sympathize with him for the way Fred Skolnick's life has gone. Rob Schmidt is a good director.  After I watched the movie, I listened to his commentary, which was interesting and just as entertaining as the movie.  Everything he meant to get across was received.  The best thing about this movie is that it ends the way you wish all movies would end, you feel good about having seen it and you're still pondering it 2 hours later.  This is worth buying and the soundtrack is awesome. It became one of my favorite movies after having only seen it once.",986947200,2,1200,4.730769230769231
1389779,4,B000053V7I,"I was impressed by the film from the opening reel..  ilike the style the director chose and the cast was absorbing, especially Monika Keena..  Keena plays a teenage girl living the white suburbanite dream.  She lives in a big beautiful house, shes dating the footbal pretty boy, she is popular and her parents hate each other..  Her mother (Ellen Barkin) is married to a man she doesnt love and obviously hasn't loved in some time..  but he takes care of her, so she doesnt leave, until she meets a man that makes her happy..  her husband finds out and gets into a fight with her new beau in the local yogurt shoppe..  this causes turmoil in the young girls perfect existence..  suddenly people are taling about her, and she isn't popular anymore..  not to mention that there is some creepy kid following her around taking pictures of her..  then mom moves out and step daddy turns up dead..  and of course..  mom is blamed because a neighbor heard her say she hoped he died, and there is a life insurance policy..  but mom didn't do it..  will the real killer come forth or will mom be convicted for a crime she didn't commit??  i really enjoyerd this movie..  i went in with no expectations or reservations, and i enjoyed it..",982886400,5,1228,4.513636363636364
1389780,3,B000053V7I,"This movie is an example of how badly an interesting and solid story can be squandered due to a directors ridiculous excesses.  The plot follows a teenage girl who is tormented by her family situation, and she commits a rather brutal crime and she eventually can't live with whats happened as a result of it, and she gives in.  That's a rather generic plot outline, but I don't like giving away plot-lines in my review.  I think a general outline should suffice.  Rob Schmidt, the director, has decided to let his presence be known at every place he can, from the ridiculous chapter slides at the beginning of each section of the film, to the style of the film itself.  It is so self-consciously arty, its like he can't let the story simply unfold.  The voiceovers from the angelic faced stalker are the most troubling aspect, I hate voiceovers in general, but these are the most pretentious ones I have heard in a long time.  Note to future filmmakers: NO PHILOSOPHY IN VOICEOVERS.  The reason I give it three stars, is basically because of the acting.  Monica Keena gives a very convincing performance, and shows that talent lurks underneath the very enticing exterior.  Michael Ironside gives an outstanding performance as the abusive father, his spontaneous explosions of fury are very convincing.  Ellen Barkin and others all flourish in supporting roles.  This movie could have been great, very very easily.  The story was there, but the Director had to become an artist at the expense of the film, which I think will turn a lot of people off.",982195200,3,1549,4.7565543071161045
1389781,5,B000053V7I,Anyone with even a little interest in movies has got to see this movie.  The acting is some of the best I've seen in any movie this year.  It gripped me from the opening scene and never lost me once.  It was a well put together cast and probably one of Vincent Kartheiser's best movie to date.  This movie reaches out to teenagers on all levels and deals with some hard hitting subjects.  I think everyone could get something out of watching it.,981676800,,445,4.313253012048193
1389782,4,B000053V7I,"Never before have I seen such a sombre, and utterly dark film aimed at teens. I mean of course there was Heathers, but that of course had it's share of humour.  Crime and Punishment in Suburbia, though it has changed most of the important roles in the novel around, has still managed to encapuslate the ideals that Dostoyevsky held so true. True love, honour, sin, and ultimately redemption are explored in a manner that is both sophisticated and entertaining. This movie is however, an accquired taste. Those teens who eat up the pulp pop products and image produced today like candy will not understand the films underlying message, and will likely be bored by the films slow pace. But us more intelligent teens will rejoice that for once, filmakers are not looking down on us as stupid people who will go to see whatever is thrown their way. If u missed it in theatres (since it was such a small release), catch it on video or dvd, and you will be treated to a cinematic journey unlike many I have experienced before. Show Hollywood that we enjoy smart films like this, if we don't, then we will endlessly be forced to watch repeated screenings of DUDE WHERES my CAR until eternity rolls around! Now that my friends is the true ideal of hell!",978480000,8,1245,4.582959641255606
1389783,5,B000053V7I,"This film blends colorful film-making with the macabre tale of a teen beauty who can not bear the abuse of her step-father any longer. She takes matters into her own hands by joining with her jock boyfriend to attack and murder him. The thing that makes this film stand above the rest is the manner in which the story unfolds.  The film illustrates how a good director can turn such a classic story as ""Crime and Punishment"" into an modern work of genius. Watching the story unfold makes you feel like you're right in the middle of it.",978393600,2,535,4.459183673469388
1389789,3,B000053V7I,Wathcing this film one does think of Amercian Beauty. It's sort of a dark take on suburan life. Moncia Kenna is wonderful in the lead role as a girl who convices her boyfriend played with excelent pussy whipped charm by James DeBello. to do the unthinkable. Vincenet Krashter is also good as a neighbor who knows more then he leads on.,1206489600,,335,4.508196721311475
1389790,3,B000053V7I,"This particular story could be turned into a breath-taking film with the right director.  Too much is held back, and the film seemed all too typical.  The director does not give a true, gritty, raw look into the troubled life this young girl led, and the story that unfolded.  On the bright side,  Vincent Karthieser is brilliant, and hes about the only one.  Though there is nothing that makes this film stand out as great, it is entertaining, and will keep your attention.

Overall, its worth watching. A decent film I suppose.  But it won't be one for the ages.  It won't be one that will leave you ""shocked"" or ""stunned"".  For a true gritty look into the troubled lives of adolesence with a slightly similar story...A movie that will really leave you stunned, watch 'Bully' instead.",1109289600,,786,4.678832116788321
1389791,3,B000053V7I,"There's no better way to put it, this film is an enigma, at least for me.  At times it can be laughable because of how serious it takes itself and at other moments you get drawn into the obsessive tone of the film.  It's hard to categorize this film when it simply wants to enjoy being anonymous and ellusive.  The film would probably be a good cult movie if only it had a cult following.  Though it could never live up to the competitors, including Donnie Darko (which had a better script, actors, and director).
Though being a very loose adaptation of the classic novel, it might draw people to enquire about the novel.  I would hope that would be one of the outcomes of people viewing this film.
But if you're looking for a dark teen film watch Donnie Darko instead.",1090195200,,769,4.387323943661972
1389792,2,B000053V7I,"Rob Schmidt's modern day take on Dostoyevsky is a promising film that is so drowned in glossy imagery and bleak characters that it never seems to generate the type of interest in story-telling that it should. Monica Keena is the beautiful head cheerleader who seems to have the perfect life but in reality is trapped in a suburban nightmare. Vincent Kartheiser (""Another Day In Paradise"") is the token bright but misunderstood outcast who lusts for Keena but can't find a way to her heart. When she murders her abusive stepfather with the help of her jock boyfriend, the evidence ends up pointing to her mother. This leads to a cycle of events that never seem to be captured with the level of drama or intesity that you'd expect. ""Crime + Punishment"" is as dark and devoid of energy as Larry Clark's ""Kids"" or Darren Aronofsky's ""Requeim For A Dream"" but it doesn't stand out the way they did. There are some solid perfomances from Keena and the always-dependable Michael Ironside as her drunken stepdad but none of the characters ever seem to stand out. While the story bares a passing resemblance to ""American Beauty"" in some areas, Schmidt never seems to move past his love for visual flare and give us any type of intriguing character moments. Keena's closing narrative makes for a good way to end the film but it seems like a case of ""too little, too late"" in my opinion.",1086048000,,1376,4.666666666666667
1389793,5,B000053V7I,"And on the eighth day, God said, ""let there be 'Crime + Punishment in Suburbia,'"" and it was so.  And He saw that it was TOTALLY SWEET!!  Let me tell you why this movie is quite simply one of the most face-slapping-in-a-good-way chefs d'uvre* ever created.  First, Ellen Barkin, Michael Ironside, AND Jeffrey Wright in the same movie?!  These three are the Lisa Leslie, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O'Neal of the acting world, respectively.  There's just no way to go wrong when you've got a cast like that.  But even this triumvirate of talent cannot alone account for this movie's astonishing success.  Writer Larry Gross deserves a double high-five for the addition of C+P to the canon.  Larry, the originator of the popular catchphrase ""Don't touch me unless you love me!,"" can certainly touch me whether he loves me or not!  C+P's is the hippest, smartest script this reviewer has had the pleasure of experiencing.  But it doesn't take smarts like Mr. Gross's to realize that Crime + Punishment = AN INSTANT CLASSIC!  The question is not whether this movie will change the way we think about cinematography, but when.

1389794,5,B000053V7I,"Some reviewers say this movie is a teen movie. It isn't. Some people say it's based on Crime and Punishment. It's not.
""Crime and Punishment in Suburbia"" is a excellent film about being misunderstood. Vincent Kartheiser's portrayal of Vincent is truly excellent and very believable because we've all gone through our cynical goth phase at some point in our lives. I really can understand and identify with the silent anger and cynicism that he feels as he deals with the young woman that he loves and the other people around her. The writers, actors and the director of Crime and Punishment in Suburbia have really tapped into the angst of teenage/young adult angst and created a beautiful film that truly deserved more praise. Let's hope it grows as a cult classic over the years.",1080604800,,781,4.835820895522388
1389795,5,B000053V7I,"Like other people who have seen this film, I must admit that I rented it once and then bought a copy immediately afterwards. Supposedly based on Dostoyevsky's novel ""Crime and Punishment"" with a modern, suburban American setting, this film from director Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn) is an enormously entertaining look at the plight of alienated youth. I know, I know; the idea of ""alienated youth"" is so ridiculous and so overdone these days that just referring to the phrase ought to elicit snorts of derision from the viewing public. What elevates ""Crime + Punishment in Suburbia"" above the usual fare in this genre is the great cast, how Schmidt organizes his film, and the grand soundtrack. Of course, the gorgeous Monica Keena in the lead role of Roseanne Skolnik certainly made my heart thump a few times. Yes, this movie is a teen drama, but it appeals even to an old fogy like me. There are a few flaws, especially the extremely loose association made with Dostoyevsky's novel, but they are few in number overall.
Roseanne Skolnik, on the surface, seems to have everything a young bubblehead could want in this world. She is beautiful, lives in a huge house, is extremely popular in school, and even dates a star member of the football team. Behind the face she presents to the public, however, Roseanne aches inside. Her alcoholic salesman stepfather, played with incredible range by the versatile Michael Ironsides, torments Roseanne and her mother every chance he gets. Skolnik's mother Maggie (Ellen Barkin) can barely contain her increasing sense of frustration as she attempts to navigate around her drunken husband. We learn about Roseanne's tortured private life through the eyes of social misfit Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser), a Goth type guy who has a major crush on Roseanne. Vincent follows her around wherever she goes taking dozens of photographs of his love, and he quickly realizes she is a fellow sufferer in desperate need of assistance.
Vincent stands back for the most part, though, because he recognizes that he must wait for Roseanne to freefall before he can help. Skolnik's destruction isn't long in coming after her stepfather commits an appalling act and Roseanne enlists the assistance of her boyfriend Jimmy (James DeBello) in order to seek bloody revenge against her tormentor. Horrible crimes, however justified they may be, often lead to unforeseen circumstances. This is exactly what happens when the police pin a murder charge on Maggie Skolnik, a prime suspect in the death of patriarch Skolnik because she had left her husband for another man shortly before the crime took place. Roseanne must confront her guilt and soon finds herself gravitating to the soothing influence of Vincent in order to assuage her conscience. A terrible choice must be made, and ultimately is, and the conclusion of the film deals with the aftermath of Roseanne's actions.
I simply adored the cast of this film. Monica Keena, who deserves as many accolades as possible, plays Roseanne quite well. It is interesting to see her physically change as the public humiliation caused by several family incidents turns her into a social pariah. Vincent Kartheiser plays his role a little too smoothly perhaps, as it is difficult to imagine a teenager having his life this together, but he also gets you to root for his character and hope that this odd looking kid wins over Roseanne in the end. Ellen Barkin really needs no description; she is always good in any role no matter how major or minor. Is it just me or is Barkin one of those women who get better looking the older they get? The real standout performance in ""Crime + Punishment in Suburbia"" is Michael Ironsides as the rapidly disintegrating Fred Skolnik. We usually see this actor playing the heavy in movies like ""Scanners"" and ""Total Recall,"" but here he plays a different type of bad guy, one who Schmidt invests with enough contradictions to make the viewer sort of feel for the man. What he does to Roseanne is obviously beyond the pale, but the problems he faces in life and the difficulties he has with his wife should invoke some sympathy on the part of the audience. It helps that Ironsides possesses the chops to pull the role off. The only character I disliked was James DeBello's turn as the thickheaded Jimmy.
""Crime + Punishment in Suburbia"" is a visually interesting film, centered as it is on several noticeable book like chapter breaks. There could have been less MTV style editing, a technique I think has been done to death over the past few years, although even I have to admit it works well here. A few scenes left me scratching my head, such as the  ""Triumph of the Will"" type football pep rally; perhaps subsequent viewings will allow me to decipher what the significance of scenes like this mean. Fortunately, most difficulties in the film disappear due to the excellent characters and marvelous soundtrack. The DVD version of the movie offers a commentary with director Rob Schmidt and Michael Ironsides (no Monica Keena, regrettably) and both widescreen and fullscreen picture transfers. A final note: ignore the over the top box cover and just watch the movie. If you like fine performances, you will enjoy this movie.",1070236800,15,5216,4.920544835414302
1389796,3,B000053V7I,"its good for some time then it wallops in a slow pace, but then the kicker is the muder and the twists and turns. Michael Ironside seems miscast but thats me. Monica Keena and Vincent Kartheiser have a weird chemistry that makes it spark. Jeffrey Wright is awesome in one of his best roles since Basquait. fans will notice Kartheiser because of his Angel fame.",1066953600,,360,4.553846153846154
1389797,5,B000053V7I,"I first saw this move about a year ago on the sundance channel and fell in love with it. It isn't a word for word based on the book kinda movie, its more about the emotional aspect. The movie itself is just so good, its proably a better idea to pretend it has nothing to do with Crime & Punsihment, because comparing it to the book will just leave you upset.
Vincent Karheisers charicter is really good int his movie, because he's just weird enouhg to play the quiet stalker type, but also charming and sweet enough to be the sorta concious of the movie. The ending  is by far the best part of the movie, and it makes you cry. The movie deals wiht the orblems of being a teenager very well, and the highschool scenes are true to life, because they don't focus on the whole Jock/bully thing, they focus more on the sorta notreally there poeple who exist inhighschools today, and the way everything sorta looks surreal.",1065225600,,917,4.394117647058824
1389798,4,B000053V7I,"I'll admit, when I first heard that a movie based on Dostoevsky's novel was going to be released, but set ""in suburbia"" I was quick to dismiss the film as trash.  My opinions seemed validated at the time, as almost every critic (with the exception of Roger Ebert) panned the film as an uninspired, pretentious mess.
So as I was browsing through the aisles of my local video store, I saw this film in the used bargain bin for a few bucks.  Being in the mood for some campy, so-bad-it-makes-you-laugh fun, I bought this film, expecting it to be awful.  Much to my surprise, the movie isn't that bad.  While the writer took liberties with the source material, the director captured one of the main themes in the novel.  It deals with conscience, guilt, and redemption in a way that was fresh, but those familiar with the book could see the parallels between film and book.
The main problems that I have read about this movie stem from the director's use of transitions and ""chapter titles"" to draw attention away from the film to the director.  In addition, some have said that the movie takes itself way too seriously.  For me, none of these were problems...in fact, I enjoyed the flair that the director showed, and the tone seemed to fit the subject matter.  Yes, the film feels uneven at times, and no, it doesn't follow the novel to a T.  But this was a throroughly enjoyable film that was undeservedly underrated.",1056672000,3,1416,4.587301587301587
1389805,3,B000053V7I,"In a mundane suburban area where high school students sort themselves into groups of popularity.  This is where Vincent lives and finds the love of his life, Roseanne.  However, she is one of the popular girls who would never date someone like the rebellious loner Vincent, unless something would change the situation for Vincent.  Roseanne's family seems to be happy on the exterior, but their daily routine seems to be filled with sarcasm and hostility.  The parental arguments increases as Roseanne's mother finds another man and wants a divorce, and this also begins to change Roseanne's status at school.  The beginning social change that Roseanne undertakes is only the tip of the ice berg.  Crime and Punishment in Suburbia is a loose adaptation of Dostoevsky novel Crime and Punishment where the director leads the story toward adolescent enlightenment in psychological, social, and emotional issues.  The film offers a satisfactory cinematic experience that intrigues the viewer with social issues, but it is far from a superior film.",1055289600,,1043,5.246987951807229
1389806,3,B000053V7I,"It was one of my favorite movies, but not anymore. I've lost interest in the actor, (Vincent Kartheiser) who plays Vincent in that movie with (Monica Keena) who plays Roseanne, a popular girl in high school. Vincent is a weird gothic kind of person who is obsessed with Roseanne. He takes pictures of her and just fascinates her in his wet dream.
Roseanne has a football boyfriend, Jimmy played by (James DeBello) to fool around with. But when Roseanne still has to take care of her reputation, she has problems at home. Her mother and her stepfather had a fight one night. Despiting of her alcoholic stepfather, she had to protect herself from being rumored at school. Roseanne and her boyfriend, Jimmy plans to kill the stepfather while her mother roams away with her new boyfriend. It was a nasty scene... bloody hell...
But things aren't getting better. Jimmy gets injuryed and steps back, leaving Roseanne alone guilty. However, after the murder, Roseanne's mother is arrested after she declares she did it (in order to protect her daughter's innocence) Too bad, Roseanne appoarches to the court and pledges guilty.
All during that time, she has to turn to Vincent for help. Vincent helps her undergo court trails and her place in prison. Every day, Vincent visits Roseanne at the prison, developing some awkward relationship between them. Jimmy is soooo scared of Roseanne, the murderer.

1389808,4,B000053V7I,"This film wowed me. I truly wasn't expecting the kind of film I saw. I expected more of a _gee lets get naked and show our lusty teen bodies then kill people and listen to MTV friendly music!_ kind of film but that's not quite what I got. Instead I got a rather pleasant viewing experience, Monica Keena, an actress I had never seen, nor heard of before watching this movie, really got to me with this weighted eyes and a crying in the shower scene that looked to be straight out of Leaving Las Vegas. Also this film had the dumb jock boyfriend but a new take on the dumb jock boyfriend that most teen movies seem to have. The dumb jock boyfriend was more or less pretty sensitive, he loved Keena's character enough to kill for her. And of course, this movie featured your typical teen film, freaky, dressed in black, messed up haricutted (yeah double negative, so what?) outsider kid, with, yes, a camera. This all jumbled together some how made a nice film that I enjoyed a lot.
I give this film a 4 because I had a big problem believing that Rosanna (Keena) wouldn't have just let her mother go to jail. Her mother, played by Ellen Barkin, left with her new boyfriend and left poor Rosanna alone in a house with an obviously abusive, alcoholic, stepfather that was clearly disturbed. Then she calls and gets the guy all set off, leading to the eventual... well, watch the movie and find out what the little call from mom did to help out Rosanna's day. If it were me I would have let mom go to jail and I would have gotten away with the perfect crime. But hey, that's just me.",1016668800,,1578,4.33445945945946

Vincent was meant to be the kinda scary stalker type but he was actually sweet, caring  and understanding to Roseanne, even though he knew her better than she thought. This movie was somewhat haunting and I could not stop thinking about it for days. I watched it about three times and each time I heard words I missed previous times. Roseanne's ""Help me"" to Vincent something I didn't catch at first because she was whispering but that scene was great. The end was my favourite part. I loved the song that was playing. I had definently fallen for Vincent as well.

Where to begin?  Firstly there's the stalker-like kid who has to photograph everything (except the budget for this film could only afford a still SLR camera, instead of a Sony DV Camcorder), then there's the honey, who becomes something of an object of infatuation for the stalker-kid.  And, of course, in the manner of 99.9% of all american movies, the nerdy, stalker-kid gets the honey.

While Dostoyevsky made his point with words, Rob Schmidt did the same with the films imagery which truly was both narcotic and haunting. He would make you feel as if you were in some drug induced dream/nightmare. You felt as if you were trapped between Heaven and Hell, happiness and sorrow, love and loss.
As the story progresses you watch the ghosts of Rosanne (Monica Keena) slowly absorb her. She goes from this glowing image of beauty to a shadow of a human being. It's stark and disturbing. While Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser) the seemingly gloomy one, who loves her from the begining of the film is the sole voice of reason, hope, and beauty in her slowly cascading world of tragedies.
The film epitomizes the continious hopelessness that many today feel but refuse to acknowledge. Although, I think what the film does best is that it shows us these sadnesses while reinforcing us with the concepts that we can make anything happen if we want to badly enough. Good or bad, we are the only ones responsible for our fates.",997401600,7,1218,4.643518518518518

I saw this movie when it first came out in the theatres and the experience you feel from the big screen is far more powerful for this film. You not olny feel the vibrations, but are so visually stimulated that the overall experience becomes magical. The gore was believable, the idea was pristine and imaginative, very fitting for such an expression of poetry in film.

7930012,4,B000053V7I,"This film is loosely based off of Dostoevsky's classic. I looked at the cover and imagined some cheesy teen flick that would not only have laughable acting but would murder the story. That I did not find. I'll be clear; it is a teen film. But I think a high school setting is perfect in conveying some of the novel's aspects, especially that of 19th century Russian society's gossipy nature.

There is one big critique I have, and that is how big characters from the book like Razumikhin, Marmeladov, Porfiry, Dunya, Katerina, and Svidrigailov are all cut down for budget. It seems that the football boyfriend is a mixture of Svidrigailov and Razumikhin. I won't criticize the film for making Raskolnikov a girl (Roseanne) and Sonya a guy (Vincent). I just think that if it is Crime and Punishment based, it is very, very, very, loosely based. Though things here and there like Roseanne being  harsh and rude to Vincent during their date do parallel Raskolnikov's treatment of Sonya.

The second huge critique I have is that Raskolnikov was an immature, narcissistic slacker that though himself a great man without having stepped in the real world. He wouldn't work an honest day because he thought it too below him, and dreamt up big plans to kill his moneylender in the name of ""removing obstacles"" to greatness. He would use her money and go back to school to become something great- a thinker, a philosopher, a hero. But mostly, because he thought so highly of himself. That narcissistc kernel that laid at the heart of his mind propelled him to killing Alyona and as his ""theory"" went, probably to kill others. But guilt brought him down. I see none of that grandeur in the movie; Roseanne killed her stepfather because he raped her. It was out of vengeance. There is no way you can parallel charging too much interest and being a stingy stickler with rape. The movie has good parallels on small details of the book, but on the big issues it falls off the tracks. Yes Roseanne is immature, but so was everyone in her school, and her immaturity wasn't what made her kill her stepfather, it was her rage and pain at being raped.

Other than those two big critiques I think this film was well done cinematically and the acting was good too. Its funny how they have Ironside (Stargate) passing out drunk watching the Sci-Fi channel. They poke stuff like that around in this movie. The big issue I think, with making Raskolnikov female and Sonya male is that there will be trouble finding a parallel aspect on the male Sonya (Vincent) that makes his reputation so poor as Sonya's was in the novel (she was a prostitute). They did make him a photo-taking creep, but I don't think that reputation brings any sympathy at all, compared to a young girl pushed into prostitution out of need. On the good side, the film didn't have any laughable scenes- top notch performance by the actors. The environment portrayed both innocence and darkness; and the dialogue flowed well. Just take ""loosely based on Crime and Punishment"" with a grain of salt. It was VERY VERY loosely based.

Overall: Enjoyable, decent film. Just not really deserving of the name. If they changed the name to something else, and added some hints to Dostoevsky- like making a character quote him or something, then perhaps the Netflix reviewers might have given it an extra star.",1309478400,,3343,4.717465753424658

7930014,3,B000053V7I,"To the outside world it seems like Roseann Skolnick (Monica Keena) is your typical privileged teen. She's  the head cheerleader who dates a popular football player named Jimmy (James DeBello).  Her family lives in a huge mansion in the wealthy part of town. However Roseann lives a far darker existence that comes complete with a drunk step dad who is verbally abusive to his wife.  Fred (Michael Ironside) is a bitter drunk whose only satisfaction in life comes from making his wife Maggie (Ellen Barkin) feel miserable. He tortures her every night at the dinner table while a helpless Roseann watches.  Maggie wishes he would die and dreams of escaping Fred for good. Outside Roseann's window hides a creepy voyeur named Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser) who snaps roll after roll of film documenting his crush's unhappiness. Vincent longs to be her white knight and when the time is right he plans on rescuing Roseann. At her breaking point Maggie begins an affair with a young man named Chris (Jeffrey Wright) who she meets one night at a club. She sets off a horrible chain of events that begins with rape and ends in a murder that lands Maggie on Death Row. Her entire family is affected by her choices and their lives will be altered forever. The film does a very good job of showing the horrors that take place behind closed doors of seemingly perfect, affluent families. The actors really excel at making these characters believable and sympathetic. Ironside, a veteran of many horror/sci-fi films, is certainly creepy, but his Fred is  a man desperate to connect with his stepdaughter. He clearly loves her and her mother but he doesn't know how to express it. Barkin, in a very reserved performance, is heartbreaking as the long suffering wife who saw her chance for escape and took it and who pays the ultimate price. DeBello, a familiar face in many a teen film, is his usual obnoxious and rude self but he actually turns in one of his best performances. He is an extremely supportive, and protective boyfriend to Roseann who is willing to do anything to keep her safe from harm. Unfortunately he's  easily manipulated by her and he pays the price for it. My  favorite performance is that of Kartheiser. He's  terrific as the  oddball outsider who shows up to school wearing garlands of garlic to ward off evil spirits. All the teens think they can label him a weirdo and pay him no attention but he is very perceptive of their plight and is the only one offering them any solutions. It's a well made film that raises good points and makes everyone responsible for their actions.",1237334400,,2587,4.743875278396437
