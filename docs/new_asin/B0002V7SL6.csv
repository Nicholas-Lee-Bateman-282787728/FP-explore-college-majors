2121312,5,B0002V7SL6,"This movie is a great movie to add to your DVD collection.  Especially if you are a mob fan.  This movie is about corruption within the mob, about betrayal, about death and dying.  It starts off with someone trying to whack the don, and the family trying to find out who it is and why.  I'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story.  Just watch it.  Mario Puzo's The Last Don (1997) was great too.",1103068800,10,409,4.113924050632911

It's in full screen (1.33) don't let that take away the enjoyment, great movie, Leo Rossi at his

8032362,3,B0002V7SL6,I'm a Deaf man....it's not either close-captioned or has English subtitles like it said in their details before I bought it. It could have been way better if it was so i can really enjoy the movie. So I had to say it's okay because it's hard for me to know whadaf*#k they were saying.,1372377600,,284,4.181818181818182
8032363,3,B0002V7SL6,"This movie was ok, not a high budget flick.
It stays in the tradition of the MAFIA genre.
Not a ""GODFATHER"" or ""GOODFELLAS"".
I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!",1258934400,,157,3.9375
8032364,5,B0002V7SL6,"Not the greatest movie I've ever seen and certainly not a ""Godfather"" but enjoyable, nonetheless.",1200096000,,97,5.533333333333333
8032365,2,B0002V7SL6,"This film contains every Mafia/Italian American stereotypical cliche in the book.  In an hour and forty minutes you get elements of the ""Sopranos"", ""Goodfellas"", and ""The Godfather"" all rolled into one low budget movie.  I was amused at how far the producers were willing to go with this! Hence the two star rating...",1169942400,3,317,4.962264150943396
8032366,1,B0002V7SL6,"I like gangster movies and am from Philly so I gave this movie a chance. What a mistake. The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation.

It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it.

The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent.

Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family.

This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later.

Save your money. Wish I could get mine back. It's been a long time since I saw a movie so bad I felt angry and ripped off for having seen it.",1130630400,4,1468,4.209964412811388
