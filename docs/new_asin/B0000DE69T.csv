8000755,5,B0000DE69T,The dvd by George Jones and Tammy Wynette was fine. Just wish that there were more songs on the tape with both of them singin together. It is a older tape and I just like to see them sing together because they sound so perfect. Recommend anyone to buy it who loves to hear George and Tammy sing.,1366588800,2,295,4.103448275862069
