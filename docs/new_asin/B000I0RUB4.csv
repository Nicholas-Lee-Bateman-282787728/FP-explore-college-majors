8143030,5,B000I0RUB4,"I first saw this movie when it was released in 1955. I was a college student at that time and I like the movie very much. Eventually it became a blockbuster and was an all time hit. As time moved by and Bollywood changed so much over the years that these one time classics became history. With the advent of DVD and You tube, these movies are again available and can be watched sitting in you tliving room. I would suggest to the younger generation to watch this Raj Kapoor Nargis classic. You will see what a master filmmaker Raj Kapoor was and why the Raj Kapoor Nargis pair was so popular. This movie is all entertainment. Mr. Raj Kapoor knew better than any one else how to make people laugh. With excellent music and a very contemporary story line depicting the socio economic picture of 1950's Mumbai ( Bombay ), this film will remain an immortal classic and will remain a class by itself. Since the DVD are subtitled the movie will be enjoyed by english speaking people also.",1410566400,2,982,4.461111111111111
