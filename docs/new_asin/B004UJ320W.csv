4467354,4,B004UJ320W,"This is just a fun, strange, different yet weirdly familiar little film.

I know there will be fanboys/girls who howl that this is not a Repo Man sequel.
Anyone looking for a direct sequel to Repo Man needs to pick up ""Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday: The Official Sequel to Repo Man"", the graphic novel done by Alex Cox when filming of the sequel fell apart.

Repo Chick stands on its own two high heels. Keep an open mind, you might be surprised as I was.",1309651200,,450,4.345238095238095
4467355,2,B004UJ320W,"Like a lot of people from my generation, Alex Cox's ""Repo Man"" was an important part of my life. This strange, nihilistic, cult-classic captured the odd mood of my time. Therefore it was only natural that when I heard of this I'd seek it out and give it a look over.
Unfortunately I was very disappointed.
There's just not much to this movie. Filmed quickly, the script seemed to lack much in the way of mood, meaning or point. The dialogue often seems pointless and it was difficult for me to really see what it was aimed at commenting on. (Ok, there's economic problems, see, and a growing gap between the rich and poor, but, and I think this is where the film diverged a bit from Repo Man, nobody really seemed to be attached to the problem in a spiritual sense. Their actions may have resulted from the situation but their personalities did not seem to have been created in response to the setting.)
All in all, a great disappointment that was 25 years in the making. I wish it had been better.",1305763200,2,998,4.429347826086956
4467356,1,B004UJ320W,"If you are expected a sequel to Repo Man you will be sorely disappointed.

This move is an odd work of art and I don't mean that in a good way.
It was mostly shot in front of green screens with the backgrounds added after.  The characters are weird and almost cartoonish and nothing is taken very seriously in this art movie, quiet the opposite of Repo Man. After you watch the movie you may grasp some concept of what the background setting is, as a character did at the end, but you are really only left confused and wondering why.

A few of the actors in Repo Man appear in the movie, but all that does is give it something in common with Plan 9 From Outer Space.  Although it was comforting to hear Olivia Barash's (Leila) raspy voice in a cameo towards the end.

So unless your are some weird fan of Alex Cox creations, I would not buy this thing.  There's a reason it never made it into the theaters.",1301788800,5,906,4.208092485549133
4467357,4,B004UJ320W,"This movie didn't give me any laugh out loud moments, but it was still entertaining. Most movies try to get background/scenery as near to realistic as possible, this movie went the other way making everything look as fake as possible, it's actually funny. The movie itself is pretty good. The Repo Chick is really beautiful. There is no nudity, maybe one curse word and while there was no same sex action there are a few guys that at gay. A good little movie to watch with teens.",1298851200,3,479,4.517241379310345
8441592,5,B004UJ320W,It deserves the full Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment.  I love it in it's truly awfulness.  It's like a car accident but you're in it and you're stuck in slow motion waiting for it to come to some sort of conclusion.  Give up and just accept you're going to die alone and then the movie isn't so bad.,1514332800,,306,4.241379310344827
8441593,5,B004UJ320W,"This film is NOT a sequel to Repo Man as others, including Alex Cox, have stated. It is another installment in the 'Repo Genre' as Cox explains in the 27 minutes documentary Better Than Money, included as a fascinating extra here.
For me the 1984 film Repo Man is like a live action underground comic, or graphic novel. Repo Chick is much more so, in a brilliant artistic way.
Extensive use of green screen makes for much more visual innovation and the results are obvious. Toys, models, CGI, all these elements are available creative tools and are well assembled here.
All the characters in Repo Chick are unique as in Repo Man but are not as well defined or developed but I found the Giggli character an exception. Her disillusionment is so felt I actually empathized with her.
Music is an essential part of both films which is of course Punk or Alternative but Repo Chick's soundtrack is more subtle, or techno, or corporate?
It is interesting to see a few actors from the 1984 film in this one. Alex Cox has a great cameo as the demented (competitive?) Professor! A blatant homage to Dr. Strangelove.
I think both films are brilliantly brutal satires for the economic recessions of the 1980s and 2000s. The cluelessness of the characters and the absurdity of Political Correctness and Social Class are defining elements for both. Cox is an observant genius.
There are a number of scenes that tie both films together, it's obvious to me anyway and it is interesting to see how much technology has changed the Repo Genre. No desperate calls from phonebooths anymore and no privacy either thanks to GPS.
I think Repo Chick is a nihilist masterpiece in the tradition of Repo Man.
Underrated and it may remain so for some time, at least until enough people can find the attention span to take it in.

The DVD doesn't upscale worth a flip, especially on a 4K TV.",1484438400,,1886,4.6467065868263475

All the characters in the film are quirky. The background for the film utilizes plastic models, giving the production a surreal cartoon, other dimension effect. The film is laced with political and cultural satire. I loved the billboard ""Re-elect Supreme Court Justice...""

8441597,5,B004UJ320W,"Alex Cox is as political as ever, but as with 3 Businessman, he poured a lot of soul into Repo Chick.  This isn't the withering critique of Walker or the stark economic picture you get in The Revenger's Tragedy, but rather a hilarious portrait of how America would look if people still had, you know, a sense of humor.  A fantastic style, a comic genius named Jaclyn Jonet, the role Miguel Sandoval was born to play, and a final line that will fill you with warmth and hope -- and its hilarious.  A beautiful film.",1394409600,,514,4.389473684210526
8441598,1,B004UJ320W,"I *really* wanted to like this movie.  In the short period from 1984 to 1987, Alex Cox gave us the Repo Man, Sid and Nancy, Straight to Hell, and Walker (yes, I even liked Walker!).  He's sort of foundered ever since, and I was hoping this might be his redemption.  I was destined to be very disappointed.

First there's the filming technique.  It's done almost entirely on green screen, and then set against backgrounds mostly made of models, many of them literally model train sets.  This all seemed naggingly familiar, then hit it hit me: the great Alex Cox had ripped off Thomas the Tank Engine!  I guess this was supposed to be surreal and artsy, but it just looked cheap and stupid.  Reportedly, he did this to stay below the $200k threshold of the Screen Actors Guild. The thing is, Repo Man was filmed for $160k and (even correcting for inflation) looks about 20 times more professional than this movie.

Although this isn't really a sequel, he puts in a number of the people from the original, but this mostly reminds you that they haven't worked much since.  There are also some fairly big name actors, like Patricia Arquette, Karen Black, Chloe Webb, and Miguel Sandoval, and they're completely wasted - with the arguable exception of Sandoval, who does a fairly decent job.  It shot in 10 days, using what appears to be a rough draft of a concept for a script.  It appears they also did it Ed Wood style, always using the first take.

The plot is a weird mix of heavy handed social commentary and a desperate attempt to capture the quirky magic of Repo man, and it fails at both.  Because it's trying so hard, it also fall short in the ""so bad it's good"" category.

Finally, the music, or lack of it.  The iconic soundtrack was the magic pixie dust that turned Repo Man into a timeless gem, and a good soundtrack could even have saved this, at least at some level. However, what little music there is is clearly designed to *remind* us of the original, without stepping on any copyrights or paying any musicians.  In the end, that was the last nail in the coffin.

I suppose if you're an Alex Cox fan, you have no choice but to watch this movie, but don't say you weren't warned.",1378425600,2,2191,4.48989898989899
8441599,5,B004UJ320W,"This is a scale model (really!) of and not a sequel to ""Repo Man.""  Leave it to
Alex Cox to take us on a journey to some parallel universe.  Not  sure what just happened on the TV screen but it was just as campy as the punk culture captured in the first film. Need to watch it twice.",1368748800,,283,3.8448275862068964
8441600,1,B004UJ320W,"This is at a level of bad that is somewhat difficult to believe. Its a badly written script done against green screens with crude visual effects thrown in. Even bad television has higher production values than this thing. A Paris Hilton clone has family problems. There isn't a likeable or funny character in the whole thing. About every five minutes like clockwork the film delivers a bleedingly obvious political point. Its not funny. Its not subtile. Its a director reduced to exploiting his own work (repo man) in an embarrasing way.

I edge towards thinking that this was deliberately bad. That someone was going through the motions or a score was being settled or an artist was showing contempt for money-people and/or fans. Or else its to raise money for something else.

The budget was low, but not that low. The talent of the cast wasn't tapped at all. Sometimes bad things can be interesting. But this is a chore to even sit through.",1366848000,2,943,4.7439024390243905
8441601,1,B004UJ320W,"Geez, 12 minutes into this film and I was about to run to the bathroom to throw up twice.  Only someone as ignorant as the people that are in this film, would see something enjoyable about this film.

Just when I thought that I've seen the stupidest movie that one ever imagine (examples: Tropic Thunder, Postal, etc.), I see something new, and unimaginably possibly stupider takes the lead.

How could such a reasonably attractive female (Jaclyn Jonet) allow herself to participate in such a stupid film?  Didn't she read the script first, or could it be true that she's too stupid to read?  Because she acted so unquestionably stupid that I thought that was just natural for her character because she played ""stupid"" so well.

If I had a son that acted like any of these retards in the film, I would have had that child of mine ""put down"", ""put to grass"", so to speak.

Well, I had the self-forced, cerebral stem hemorrhaging patience to watch this film for about 45 minutes before I screamed ""I JUST CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!!"", and I darn near broke my DVD player removing this rented DVD from my disc player.

This movie was totally retarded! I'm embarrassed to even say that I rented this film.  What a wasted three days between Netflix DVD rentals. I now need a healthy educational documentary to bring me back to my senses and to flush the memory of this garbage-laden movie from my thoughts.",1337040000,4,1400,4.612903225806452
