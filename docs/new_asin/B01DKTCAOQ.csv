7718495,5,B01DKTCAOQ,Wonderful black and white who-done-it movie.  Saw it on TCM and had to own it.  DVD is great.,1476057600,2,93,4.111111111111111
7718496,5,B01DKTCAOQ,I love this little movie!  Fun in the vein of The Thin Man!,1468800000,,59,3.5384615384615383
7718497,1,B01DKTCAOQ,"Haunted Honeymoon (1940):  A lifeless clod of a script + shamefully indifferent casting + plodding, indifferent and/or hambone performances + bargain-basement-awful production values = STINKER.",1465603200,,193,6.72
7718498,5,B01DKTCAOQ,"Oddly enough, all the reviews that have teleported their way to this release are about an entirely different movie. This movie is a murder mystery which I had seen as a child and tried to find for years. I finally found it on amazon.uk and bought a region 2 player to see it. It is based on the book 'Busman's Honeymoon'  by Dorothy Sayers, in which the character Lord Peter Wimsey finally marries Harriet Vane and they go off to the country with the wonderful Bunter for their honeymoon. Things go wrong immediately when they find a corpse and Wimsey reluctantly has to solve the murder. Robert Montgomery plays a very good Wimsey and Constance Cummings is good as Harriet. I have this one in my collection to complete all of the Wimsey mysteries. I have found that having a region 2 player has come in handy to see even American movies that I cannot find here and have upgraded to a blu-ray player.",1461888000,11,900,4.487804878048781
8756205,5,B01DKTCAOQ,Item as described. What a terrible movie in the Lord Peter franchise though.,1528243200,,76,4.923076923076923
8756206,5,B01DKTCAOQ,A great old movie a bit different than the Wilder/Radner title.,1524614400,,63,4.818181818181818
8756207,4,B01DKTCAOQ,"Enjoyable if Americanized Lord Peter Wimsey. The movie is not absolutely faithful to the book, but it is faithful enough not to annoy diehard fans like myself.",1516147200,,159,4.925925925925926
8756208,5,B01DKTCAOQ,Excellent movie,1509753600,,15,7.0
8756209,4,B01DKTCAOQ,"My favorite Robert Montgomery movie!  A delightful classic that I will watch over and over again.  The video quality is very good, but the sound leaves a lot to be desired.  Sadly, that turns a 5-Star movie into a 4-Star purchase.",1508976000,,230,4.560975609756097
8756210,4,B01DKTCAOQ,"Very cute snappy version of the Lord Peter Wimsey story by Dorothy Sayers originally called Busman's Honeymoon. It actually follows the book closer than I expected, given that it's a movie based on a play based on a book but it runs well on its own merits. Not a brilliant film but a cute view for people who've worked their way through all the Wimsey miniseries and want a little more.",1505174400,,386,4.450704225352113
8756211,5,B01DKTCAOQ,Classic movies are so much more creative then contemporary. And this one is very good.,1496534400,,86,4.8
8756212,1,B01DKTCAOQ,From the very beginning this DVD skips and freezes up.,1495670400,,54,4.5
8756213,2,B01DKTCAOQ,It was not well done.,1489622400,,21,3.4
8756214,5,B01DKTCAOQ,"I caught a portion of this movie on TCM, and tried to find it on DVD. It has only recently been available for purchase, and I'm thrilled to have it. I love the characters... it's a little silly at times, but very pleasant to watch.",1483660800,,231,4.155555555555556
