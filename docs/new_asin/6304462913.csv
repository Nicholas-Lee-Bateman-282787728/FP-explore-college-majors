7871819,4,6304462913,"I saw this back in 1991, it was originally titled ""The Blimp Is Back"". It has nothing to do with flying the blimp, but actually tells the resurgance in interest in blimps from the military to hopeless romantics building dirigibles. Features Roger Monk, the modern day version of Hugo Eckner. It's very good and entertaining. The first half deals with the early history of airships. The second with the modern era of blimps. There are more blimps flying today than ever before, but the military still isn't interested, and probably never will be.",988070400,7,545,4.870967741935484
