4694254,1,B005GT3XHM,"I made the mistake of seeing this at a theater and regretted it. This movie was so bad me and my date heard someone snoring in the audience. The jokes in the movie were very lame and the plot left alot to be desired.  Me and my date had no idea of where this movie was going. During the movie we saw people gather their things and leave, which is what we did shortly later. This movie should have went straight to DVD in the first place, but even that is too good for this waste of time.",1321574400,,487,3.9693877551020407
4694255,4,B005GT3XHM,"I'm honestly not too surprised that some found this movie a little slow.  It doesn't follow what seems to be the standard cliche for ""African American"" comedy dramas, IMO.  That is, absurd drama, stereotypes, a measure of preaching and even more over-the-top drama followed up with an illogical ending all the while with sprinkles of black culture throughout and slapstick.  While there was admittedly some level of 'preach' here, it wasn't so different than any other movie and I felt it was well done in the various subtle ways due ot the characters' interaction.

I will try not to give too many spoilers away but warn that I might, so you may want to skip to the end of the review if you don't want to know too much.  The synopsis was already well described, the main characters are Ray, Donna and Dr. Zachary (Sidney), played by Brian White (JoJo White's son!), Zoe Saldana and Wood Harris.  The story is about a young doctor trying to find his way - and the pieces of his heart - after following it to an under-funded hospital in Florida.  In the aftermath, he learns quite a bit about heart, people, love and maybe most importantly, taking himself so seriously.  Who you originally think could be the main character of the movie ends up not really being the one - though it's hard to argue against the person being the most important in the movie. In the end I too have to admit, it takes a dramatic turn that actually makes sense but still (spoiler.... warning....) leaves you reflecting on the characters.

I actually really liked this movie but then again I'm a fan of Wood Harris.  He comes across as extremely down to Earth in this role like he did in ""Remember The Titan's"" and does a fantastic job with the material.  Though comedy was probably branching out for him, he held his own.  Zoe was charming as well and Brian White played her part very nicely too.  But in the end it was Wood Harris' delivery as Dr. Zachary that really delivered and perhaps the most special moment of the movie came at the most dramatic - to me at least.  The characters come across as very real, not necessarily the pedestal's in Hollywood film.  To buy the movie may be a stretch and I'd say if you're looking for an enthralling, dramatic stereotyped movie you'll be disappointed.  It does however make me look forward to Wood's portrayal of Sweetwater in a year or two.  Oh - and it was good to see Scott Paulin (ER) here, Method Mad had a cameo and Mya was on briefly as well.",1321401600,6,2474,4.498881431767338
4694256,2,B005GT3XHM,"I appreciated where this movie was going, I just didn't enjoy the ride.  All of the talented actors in this movie and it was a snoozefest.  I gave it two stars because it was o.k., but it could have been a lot better.",1320019200,,217,4.023255813953488

4694259,4,B005GT3XHM,"Does every movie have to be judged by the standards of ""the Hollywood package""?  I think not.  I think there's definatly room for movies like this that don't fit neatly into a little pidgeon-hole of ""drama"" where there are no laughs or ""comedy"" where everything's slap-stick.  This movie more closely resembles life: you have to laugh at things that are too overwhelming for tears; on the other side of laughter you find an amazing lesson that sticks with you and changes you like no lecture ever could.  Not to mention that things happen sometimes that are just....je'n se pas.
Young intern Ray Howard (Brian White) has followed his heart and a woman to Florida's ""Mediocre Memorial"" despite his blue-blood Harvard education and all its promise.  Good-looking and well-educated, he is, or is about to be, a man who can have anything.  Or is he?  As he encounters one brick wall after another he is noticed by the dynamic duo of Donna (Zoe Saldana) and Dr. Z (Wood Harris) who decide he is worthy of rescuing and mentoring.  What Dr Howard learns about ""swagger"", true friendship, compassion and especially, laughter are things Harvard could never have taught him.
  The relationships in Heart Condition make it a must-see.  Dr. Z and Donna""s is rare among on film romances and superbly done, as the the brotherhood that develops between Dr. Z and Ray.  Also unique and quirky are the marriages--watch for Marla Gibbs and Ed Asner.
  The twist is saved for the end where we have to get serious--but just for a minute.  I admit I shed a tear, (my criteria for how good a movie is)and I was inclined to ""groove at my own risk"" at the end with a terrific cast!
  Other movies you might like if you liked this one: Holiday Heart and Wonderful Life.",1318204800,12,1744,4.665573770491803
4694260,3,B005GT3XHM,"""The Heart Specialist"" is about a doctor that doesn't play by the rules, views life a little differently than everyone else, and imparts his years of wisdom on those he deems worthy. I'm talking about Sidney Zachary (Wood Harris), the chief resident of a less than prestigious South Florida hospital. He's been quietly keeping watch over the first year residents for quite some time, and has been recording his observations on a mini cassette machine. His girlfriend, Donna (Zoe Saldana), types his words, helping him along on his goal towards becoming the next Michael Crichton. He also jokes about what he sees at a local comedy club, which is part of his funded experiment to prove that laughter really is the best medicine.

He takes under his wing Ray Howard (Brian J. White), a Harvard graduate, a first-year intern, and a perpetual ladies man who can't make a commitment. He's also cold and distant from his patients, a professional man who refuses to get into their personal lives. This doesn't sit well with Zachary, who was trained in Mexico and sometimes goes by Dr. Z. He learned everything he needed to know by making those emotional connections. Through cryptic passages of dialogue and reliably eccentric behaviors, he will take it upon himself to teach the young doctor how life should really be lived. He considers himself little more than a teacher's guide, but isn't that more or less how all self-appointed mentors see themselves?

I understand and appreciate what ""The Heart Specialist"" is trying to tell me, but I see no reason why it couldn't have been told with some style. Watching this movie play out is a little like watching a movie-of-the week on cable; it looks cheap, has a limited number of settings and camera setups, specific shots seem like padding, and is saddled with a story that's rote, sappy, and predictable. The only way it breaks with tradition is that it features a relatively large cast, with Ma, Jenifer Lewis, Method Man, Jasmine Guy, and even Ed Asner all making appearances at one point or another. They must have thought there was something worthwhile, here; maybe I'm being silly, but I'd like to think some actors are motivated by more than a paycheck.

Much of the problem stems from writer/director Dennis Cooper's inability to decide on a tone. The film, intended as both a comedy and a drama, often times veers too far into both genres. Sometimes, he makes light of situations that are clearly not funny. Case in point: Marla Gibbs as Ms. Overwood, an aging bipolar patient who intentionally stops taking her lithium just so that she will be taken to the hospital. This is a serious problem, and yet Cooper reduces this character to comedy relief; she's a bawdy and badly dressed nymphomaniac who hits on all the male doctors, including Howard, much to his chagrin. Is there something about this woman that I simply didn't see?

She exemplifies the broad humor with which this film falls back on. Consider the moments Zachary's stand-up material plays out visually, like when a big, gangsta-looking man cries like a baby at the prospect of getting a prostate exam. Part of what makes stand-up so entertaining, I believe, is that it requires the audience to use their imaginations. Other scenes are just plain bizarre, like when Howard falls asleep and has a sexual fantasy about Donna; in the annuls of sexual fantasies, I've never heard of one in which the man has an emotional epiphany and then actually refrains from having sex. Come on, Dennis. You should know that dreams don't work like this, not even in the movies.

Now let's go to the other end of the genre spectrum. Characters like Dr. Zachary are bound by a convention so overused that it has lost all ability to generate within me an emotional reaction. What was once heartfelt is now contrived and manipulative. The drama of Zachary's personal mission is second only to his antagonistic relationship with Dr. Graves (Scott Paulin), a bitter old man who's mean to all the interns and thinks he's entitled to more money and respect. Characters like this add drama to the story without adding substance; their primary purpose is to make trouble for the leads to have the satisfaction of working through. Graves' one-dimensional nature is exacerbated by his sidekick, an unnecessary and buffoonish German caricature played by David S. Lee.

Other characters, like the perpetually anxious intern Mitchell Kwan (Kenneth Choi) and Howard's ex-girlfriend (Ma), are completely unnecessary and contribute absolutely nothing, apart from an excuse for frivolous subplots. I suppose the message of ""The Heart Specialist"" is a good one, although one we've heard many times before, and usually in films that at least make an effort with its characters, plot, and balancing of tone. Maybe Cooper would have been better off making this into a movie-of-the-week; at least then, most audiences would have the chance to manage their expectations a bit.  If not for the rising star power of Zoe Saldana, this probably would have never seen a theatrical release. Sometimes, I'm amazed at the films that find their way into theaters.",1295568000,9,5130,4.930555555555555

I actually thought that this movie was going to be horrible but it was pretty enjoyable and funny.  It is basically about a young doctor (Wood Harris)running a hospital.  Marla Gibbs was also funny.

4694284,5,B005GT3XHM,"I am a filmmaker. I understand the complexities when it comes to having an idea for a film and executing it. I understand that. But let's be honest, this film isn't at all what you expected it to be. For me, the film made me realize that not all African-American comedies are sheer foolishness. This story is simple, sweet, and at times, very funny. The acting was good from the principal cast, better than I thought it would be (especially from Wood Harris; he proves time after time that he is capable of taking on the most unusual and unique roles).

To the reviews based on the film in general, you don't have to like (or review) every film you see. I don't like a lot of films for different reasons, whether it's based on the script, the acting, the directing, cinematography, etc. -- but, that's not the issue here. The issue is the audience and lack of a critical response to what they felt went wrong with the film as a whole.

Movie makers want movie goers to appreciate their art, even respect it. So when I read these reviews on the film saying it was a ""snooze fest"" and ""boring film"", and the like, I get frustrated because I know how hard it is to get a project (especially a film project) executed. It's like a final exam. You study for it, get the test and read through all the questions thoroughly, and then answer them. You may get some answers right and wrong, but the main focus is the final grade. For those who misunderstood this analogy: the film is the final exam, the studying is the production, the questions represent the bad and good things about the film (acting, script, etc.), and the final grade is the feedback. So what do you have when you have unanswered questions to a test you didn't study for? You obviously get a bad film, but this film is far from bad. It is entirely watchable and different, opposed to the Tyler Perry flicks that make money for its buffoonery and post-modern minstrel shows.

""The Heart Specialist"" gives me hope that African-American comedies will survive because for one, I'm not much of a comedy fan, and two, not much of a comedy fan with an all-black cast. The film made over $1M at the box office, but I have no idea what the budget was, so I can't say whether or not it was successful overall.

As mentioned, not all films should be hammered based on whether you liked it or not. I'm sure people want to read critical reviews instead of ""I-just-didn't-like-it"" commentaries. This is where we fail as an audience. Respect the art or invent something new so people can critique you, and we'll see how much you can take. This comedy-drama is one of the best films I have seen, and thanks to the director for standing out and doing something different. Intelligence does indeed pay off.",1325376000,19,2748,4.49
4694285,2,B005GT3XHM,Needed something to do to kill time and I decided to watch because of the names in the movie.  I remembered seeing the previews on TV and I missed it in the movie theaters.  I walked away disappointed and feeling like it should have been so much better.  I'm sad this wasn't a better movie--I'm not even sure how it made it to movie theaters.,1325203200,,342,4.230769230769231
4694286,4,B005GT3XHM,"I agree with everyone who rated this movie highly.  A friend highly recommended this movie, but she did so with a bit of trepidation.  That gave me a hint I would enjoy it because this is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" piece for many.  Put me on the side of loving this film, because it is well-written, intelligent, witty, and well-executed by the cast.  My one complaint is that the scenes with Marla Gibbs are pretty milked and some other scenes went for ""funny"" as opposed to ""humorous"", neither of which was a deal-breaker for me.  I appreciated the cameos, which were simple and nicely done.

I'm most impressed by Wood Harris!  Here's an actor whose most recent high-level performance prior to ""The Heart Specialist"" was the drug lord Avon Barksdale in ""The Wire"".  His performance as Dr. Z was funny, quick, sexy, and charming.  Brian White does a great job keeping his performance simple yet effective as a womanizer and Zoe Saldana is the definition of cute in this film.  I especially appreciated the writing not going too far into subplots.  It gives you just enough to support and appreciate the main story.

The elephant in the room with this type of film is what people expect from an African-American ensemble.  Too often, these types of films can be hard to categorize because of an expectation of stereotypical preachy, over-acted, or slapstick works.  Unfortunately, the public (regardless of race) still doesn't show the capacity to appreciate an intelligently written, acted, and directed film with a majority African-American cast.  This actually reminds me of debates about ""Life"" starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence--a film promoted as slapstick but was so much more substantive.

For anyone who truly appreciates the craft of film and great writing, I highly recommend this one.",1325203200,4,1803,4.940199335548173

The jokes were not funny, the plot is solid enough yet the way they delivered it was too slow and un focused and confusing . The movie never made me care about what happened to any of the cast. I never felt any connection nor chemistry between Donna and Dr. Z.

But it would help if there was a good story involved in there somewhere! Most of the cameos here were just wasted; they didn't even have a storyline that went anywhere. The whole scene with Jenifer Lewis & Method Man could've been left out, especially since Ray found out about Z's health on his own. First, I was okay with the whole idea of Dr. Z doing this comedy-research-book thing, until it came out that he requested medical research funding to pay for it all. He preaches about caring for the patients but that's what he puts funding towards, his own personal career? (By the way, the jokes told by Marla Gibbs' bipolar character were funnier than Z's jokes, another indicator that money was wasted.) And his relationship was based off nothing but pure hero worship; he saved Donna's life, after she'd just broken up with a sleaze boyfriend, and voila, instant rebound. And WTH kind of ending was that?!?!? Brian White's character, Ray, was portrayed as a very non-discriminating player who slept with anything that moved, while supposedly pining over a lost love. But he never reforms and in the end never gets the girl. And how did the most incompetent, bumbling intern in the entire program end up taking over? I could see if it was maybe 5+ years down the road, but not right away. He was an idiot. Overall, this was a half-effort, lukewarm story with mediocre jokes and a bad ending for the hero.
