It's definitely low budget, but it makes up for it with an incredibly talented cast and a interesting plot that both scares you and gets you thinking about what it means to be a Christian. (And yes, I really was very scared in some parts!!)

I strongly recommend!",1249603200,3,407,4.575342465753424
3683758,5,B001LIP8O8,"We've seen it before, right? Half of the modern renditions of serial killers include religious motifs, with the cross, the Bible, and so on. As Steve Taylor once said in a song, ""A Christian can't get equal time, unless he's a loony committing a crime.""

In ""Dangerous Calling,"" the loony committing a crime is indeed a church-going person, but the Daws Brothers refuse to let you settle into any expectations. The murder before the opening credits sets up a cat-and-mouse game in Small-Town, USA, when a young pastor and his wife show up to fill a position at a church torn by inner strife. The strife is instigated by one person: high-tithing, manipulative Miss Pat.

This is one lady you won't forget after seeing this film. She is certifiable and creepy, and yet on the surface she wants only the best for her church, her community, and her son. She quickly realizes that her ""best"" doesn't match with the new pastor's or his wife's, and this leads to increasing tension that turns creepy, then downright pulse-pounding. The misguided and delusional dreams of Miss Pat push her and her son to violent measures, and the young pastor's wife is son caught in their web.

It's hard to describe the levels of psychological suspense employed, because they are done so well. From TVs and phones, to snakes and chickens, all sorts of devices ratchet the tension while never neglecting character development and some tightly plotted scenes. At the end of this movie--once my heart was done pounding!--I sat back and realized that in a world full of religious extremists and Bible-toting psychos, we get a glimpse here of that deadly sickness compared to those who have Godly love for others.

""Dangerous Calling"" is an extremely entertaining movie. It's also a call to Christians to stop complaining about the stereotypes and to start changing them by the way we live. This is one of those rare films that works both as psychological suspense and spiritual challenge. Now that's what I call a miracle.",1243987200,8,1996,4.8617647058823525
3683759,5,B001LIP8O8,"I was tricked! The movie was intense, full of suspense, and scary at times. No one told me it was this kind of movie. We usually stick with comedies and dramas...not intense, scary movies. But we loved it. It was one of those movies where we...(okay, mostly me) where I found myself talking to the characters throughout the movie...that's how I deal with those kinds of movies. You're going to love this movie.",1228262400,4,410,4.63013698630137
3683760,5,B001LIP8O8,"If you are a fan of Alfred Hitchcock and you have ever spent any time at all around a church or around ""church people"" you will like this film.  Characters are developed quickly, you get absorbed into the setting and find yourself in the movie, experiencing some of the same emotions the characters are experiencing.  Loved it and am giving as gift as well as recommending",1228262400,4,372,4.621212121212121
8318189,5,B001LIP8O8,"I had an original copy of this movie when it first came out which got damaged & I just had to get another.
While some of the acting is not the best the movies story will draw you in until the climax when you will find yourself giving a fist pump.
This is a welcome addition (back) to my collection.",1489536000,,298,3.9833333333333334
8318190,5,B001LIP8O8,"This is not your ""typical Christian movie"". Let's just leave that clear. You don't want to watch this with young children around. The horror and suspense aspects are realistically portrayed. A number of people are murdered-onscreen- including a teenage girl. The acting is high quality, and the camera work, while simple, is quite effective. The music underscores the action quite appropriately. Very well made, with a compelling story, and an abundantly clear point to make.

Let me speak about a core message of the film. As Dangerous Calling makes clear, not everyone professing the name of Christ is truly a follower. There is a lot of religious weirdness that is used as a cover-up for some pretty nasty stuff that goes on in the Church. And this movie uses a horror motif as a way to bring that to life.

I also want to make a Biblical point here. There are a number of people who are going to object to the portrayal of murder in this film. 1 John 3:15 says "" Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him."" The killers in this movie always kill by an assault on the back. Never to the face. There is no moral distance between literally murdering someone and stabbing them in the back with an unkind word. Yet one sin is excused and considered respectable by many, while the other is considered heinous-and rightly so.

My advice-don't watch this at midnight-like I did. Way too spooky for that. But I advise any discerning adult to view it and think about its message.",1393372800,,1536,4.619047619047619
8318191,5,B001LIP8O8,"While this movie did not have any well known actors, the acting was very good.
The plot of the movie will keep anyone on the edge of their seat.",1387584000,,144,4.0
8318192,4,B001LIP8O8,"I was looking at the bigger picture of this story. This is an extreme case of what happens when you put politics, money, and libralism over God. There were no spiritial discernment in that Bapist Church. Not even 1 person saw with their spiritial eyes the evil that was happening within the church. Therefore, this is how Christian cults are formed. As long as you have a rich member donating lots of money in the church, others feel they don't have the power to say something.",1368662400,,477,4.558139534883721
8318193,5,B001LIP8O8,Great faith based thriller. Nothing that a parent of a child over 12 (ish) should worry about.  Our girls were on the edge of their seats.,1361059200,,138,4.3076923076923075
8318194,5,B001LIP8O8,"""Dangerous Calling"" is a thriller that is set within the context of church politics.  A young minister and his wife arrive to take charge of a small town church shortly after its former pastor is murdered (though most people believe that his death was an accident).  It doesn't take long, however, for the minister and his wife to realize that there is more going on than what meets the eye.  At first, it doesn't seem like the church is different from any other church.  As elsewhere, there are those who are working for change and who want to reach out to the surrounding community.  There are also those who don't want change and who see community ""outsiders"" as threats to the well-being of the church.  But how far will those who don't want change go to protect the status quo?  In this church, it is deadly far!  I am surprised that this film has not gotten more attention than it has.  ""Dangerous Calling"" presents a realistic picture of the battles for control that can take place within churches, but then takes it up a notch by setting those battles within the context of a tense thriller that builds as the story progresses.  The characters are complex and realistic, and the ugliness of church politics is not watered down.  For a low-budget film, ""Dangerous Calling"" is very well done.",1355184000,,1298,4.649122807017544
8318195,3,B001LIP8O8,"Christian film - pretty good, if somewhat in-your-face gruesome, with one violent act committed in the first 5-10 minutes.

Horror film - Okay, middling. Not as violent as ""Saw"" or as suspenseful as a Hitchcock or spy thriller. One can see through most of the plot holes.

There are certain conventions in a Horror movie, like the setting, chases, and endings, that this film utilizes. I kept yelling at the screen for the protagonists to resist, fight, stop whimpering, moaning, screaming and run, or just to wake up and come to their senses. A lot of these situations bordered on the clichd, like when somebody discusses the rumors circling around an antagonist, or one character chases another throughout the town, yet it's all a red herring, a fake.

I don't usually like Horror but ordered this movie because of its take on church politics, and in that I wasn't disappointed. I didn't like the blood (I never do, close my eyes, but that's me personally) or the over-the-top violence at the end.

The characters - colorful, if a bit clichd. The creepy-sweet yet controlling Miss Pat and her 'strange' offspring, the wants-to-get-along yet stands-by-his-convictions Pastor, his God-fearing yet spirited wife, the caring yet somewhat clueless Youth minister.

The setting - A small-town Baptist-type church, but the music, much of the dialogue, etc. was a bit too 'Christianized' for my taste. The 'Rock music' that Miss Pat rails against was guitar-led hymns and choruses with bongos. And her compound, a chicken farm set deep in the woods, with no cellphone reception? By the time I got to the end I was thinking of films like 'The Shining', which had a similar ending.

The issues - The main one IMO was Miss Pat's agenda vs. the true function of the church, which is to worship God and welcome others into His fold. Instead this small church with a large building, set in its ways, focuses on being a 'country club' for its own, a fortress against the encroaching world. The trouble with that is that mindset excludes the very people you are trying to reach, thus the decline in attendance, the generational drift and the attempts by the previous Pastor to modernize by hiring a Youth minister. The one thing about Miss Pat being the 'meddler' is that in real life she would not have controlled the church alone, but probably would have a whole faction in the church on her side, with others opposing her group, leading to a church scandal or split.

Overall, not bad...but not very thrilling or realistic, either...",1304553600,,2522,4.837587006960557
8318196,5,B001LIP8O8,"This is one ""great"" movie.  Hitchcock could not have done a better job.  This movie truly deserves more attention than it has received.",1303516800,,135,4.826086956521739
8318197,5,B001LIP8O8,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  Makes you stop and think that there are probably people like this woman in the world.  Don't want to spoil it and say too much, but this was very well worth watching if you like Christian suspensful movies.",1280793600,,250,4.1875
8318198,4,B001LIP8O8,"Today there are a lot of generic movies out there and your 'horror' or 'thriller' movies are the worst.  Most are purely about how realistic they can make the gore, but there is very little value in the story.  This movie is more in the realm of an Alfred Hitchcock with some actual plot, mystery and drama.  The only criticism would be that the action sequences and a few of the special effects don't have the smooth symmetry you may see in some much bigger budget films, but little is lost in this and the acting is solid throughout.  In my opinion Jackie Prucha as 'Miss Pat' delivers the stand out performance as you find it both easy to sympathize and loathe her from one scene to the next.  The movie does have a religious context, but doesn't get preachy, at least not to non-Christians.  I have shown this movie to a number of friends and family and can honestly say they tend to get more emotionally involved than with most movies.  Those who are afraid of snakes get particularly frightened.  The scenery and cinematography are first rate.  The score is solid, no John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith recorded by a major symphony, but much better than most synthesized 80-90s TV movies.

Acting: A (with A+ to Jackie Prucha)
Action: B-
Story Telling: A
Suspense Building: A+
Score: B+
Dialog: A
Cinematography: A+",1266969600,2,1319,4.622317596566524
