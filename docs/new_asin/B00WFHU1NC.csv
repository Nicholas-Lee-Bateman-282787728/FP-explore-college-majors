7131556,4,B00WFHU1NC,I think a lot of people will relate to this story. It's a relationship driven plot and not unlike the many that people face when trying to decide who is best for them.

Would not recommend it",1455148800,,70,4.071428571428571
7131569,3,B00WFHU1NC,Reaches deep into the thoughts most all of us must have pondered while entangled in unpredictable romantic relationships.,1454544000,,121,5.777777777777778

7131572,4,B00WFHU1NC,"Miles To Go, is an intimate Indie film about a SoCal writer who desires a permanent relationship with his ex,, but continues to sabotage it with his deep -seeded belief that all his relationships are doomed to failure no matter how perfect they appear --- because of his sexual boredom issues. Frankly, he has an addictive personality and although he has worked on drinking and drugs, he refuses to work on his addiction to Massage Parlors. This is a story that many men will relate to, I believe, the fear of commitment versus fear of loneliness. There is also the issue of how much Mile's ex will put up with to retain a comfortable relationship with someone she loves and cares for. Once again we return to the loneliness theme.

The actors do an excellent job of conveying their points of view and although you may not agree with the character's points of view, you understand why they have them. There are some interesting choices made in the cinematography that add to the film's atmosphere. There is a very authentic feel to this film. I loved the dancing between the water and highway scene!

It's no easy task to both direct and act in a film, and to succeed as well as Quincy Rose has impresses me greatly. Kudos to Quincy!",1446768000,4,1233,4.574660633484163
7131573,2,B00WFHU1NC,"A Woody Allen wanna be, it ended up being just whiney and slow. Plus a few sex scenes to sell the movie.
Had potential and better directed, could have earned 21/2 stars.",1446249600,,169,4.3125
7131574,4,B00WFHU1NC,This was a good movie. I enjoyed watching it.,1443139200,3,45,4.111111111111111

7131577,3,B00WFHU1NC,OK,1439078400,2,2,2.0
7131578,3,B00WFHU1NC,"It was OK.  The plot became a bit mundane about 30 minutes into the movie, but if you don't have anything else to do....it is an option.  The interaction between the two main actors seemed a bit contrived but maybe that was intentional?!?",1438905600,,238,4.511627906976744

7131580,3,B00WFHU1NC,"Directing and Acting was good, photography unusual. I liked the movie however some of the foul language seemed over the top just to say ""Look at us and hear us cuss"".  The ending was not satisfying and seemed to say ""we ran out of film"".

Steve Foose",1436918400,2,250,4.297872340425532
7131581,1,B00WFHU1NC,This movie will depend on your moral judgment.  I found it disrespectful to women and men obsessed with their bottom halves.  I did not consider it worth getting past the F words.,1436659200,2,179,4.5625
7131582,3,B00WFHU1NC,Has some good moments but the main character is extremely unlikeable,1436400000,,68,5.2727272727272725
7131583,5,B00WFHU1NC,This is a nicely paced film with a lead who looks uncannily like Elvis Costello. I found it engaging and in touch with some of the sort of real lfe issues (relationship break ups etc) that affect us all at times. The production seemed quite european in style - that suited me too.,1434412800,6,280,4.30188679245283
7131584,4,B00WFHU1NC,Thought provoking and personal with strong cinematography. Give it a shot-,1434326400,3,74,5.818181818181818
7131585,1,B00WFHU1NC,Rented this by mistake and could not find a way to 'unrent' it.  Decided to watch it since I had to pay.  It was not worth the time!,1433721600,,132,3.6785714285714284
7131586,3,B00WFHU1NC,Tedious and drawn out. I started to cough from all the cigarette smoke.,1433721600,,71,4.538461538461538

7131588,2,B00WFHU1NC,Not a very interesting film. Low budget for sure.,1433635200,,49,4.555555555555555
8713110,2,B00WFHU1NC,"where do I start?  1st of all stop showing your nasty looking body and stop getting tattoos--they do not make your body or skin appear more interesting--it looks gross on a disgusting looking body. This particular movie, the main character -a man, of course, wants his cake and eat it too-nothing new.

AMAZON, how is it you can allow a movie which shows a so-called kosher person performing a ""gangsta rap""--saying the words which were in the lyrics--ni***, speaking of a ghetto and a broken family structure etc.,---then everyone resort to laughing---guess what it is not funny----especially when I as a viewer write a review on a documentary that claims a certain group of people are descendants of the Biblical characters which I disagreed with etc AMAZON would not allow my comment-stating people will be offended---I did not write anything derogatory-- AMAZON, I am tired of you and your practices.....",1531094400,,908,5.046666666666667
8713111,1,B00WFHU1NC,"This just goes to show you can't Produce, Direct, Write, Cast, Edit, and also star in your own movies, particularly when you have no good idea for a plot to begin with. I am amazed anyone would fund this flat and self-indulgent waste of time.",1526601600,,242,4.4
8713112,3,B00WFHU1NC,"Definitely went for the shock value of sexual scenes. If those were removed, I think that the characters and the story would have still been strong but without the cheapness. The story itself was deep and complicated and seemed authentic to the push and pull of trying to make love last while questioning if one wants love to last.",1518998400,,331,4.627118644067797
8713113,5,B00WFHU1NC,"An amazing realistic movie on the ups and downs of complicated relationships. Love the main character- complex,dysfunctional and totally loveable",1515196800,2,145,6.3
8713114,4,B00WFHU1NC,"I stumbled upon this film and was thoroughly entertained. The slow unraveling of relationships was dead on, honest insight into the layers of confusion that exist when we love. This is a gem of a film, and Quincy Rose's performance is honest and endearing. Rose also lonely composition shots enhance the storytelling. I loved the story, the need to face and love and know oneself first to love. Rose is the new Albert Brooks.",1508716800,,425,4.756756756756757
8713115,4,B00WFHU1NC,Entertaining and Fresh relationship film. I really connected with the main character. It is something I would certainly watch again,1493942400,,131,5.6
8713116,5,B00WFHU1NC,"Indie film producer/writer/director Quincy Rose came on my radar with his witty and insightful 2016 movie ""Friends Effing Friends Effing Friends."" Watching ""Miles"" last night shows that this rightful heir to the throne of Woody Allen is far more than a one-trick pony.

Rose artfully expresses the anxiety and the crudity of the 30-something nerdish guy. The overall theme is that the titular author wants a long-term relationship but is petrified that maintaining one is impossible, This provides the context for locker-room talk on subjects such as the extent to which a woman will take one for the team if her man really wants to experiment and the virtues of wet wipes over toilet paper.

The awesome thing about this is that it makes as great a film for a date night in a committed relationship as it does for a night with the girls or the guys.",1487116800,,850,4.736486486486487
8713117,1,B00WFHU1NC,Boring and awkward.  It seemed the main actor wanted to channel a Woody Allen but it didn't work.  Boring flick with soft porn moments.  You have better things to do with your time then watch this movie.,1483056000,,203,4.4324324324324325
8713118,4,B00WFHU1NC,Great character-driven piece. Thought-provoking drama about the intricacies and complications of relationships. Many scenes hit close to home. As soon as it ended I wanted to watch again!,1480809600,,187,5.714285714285714
8713119,4,B00WFHU1NC,Excellent and very realistic portrayal of how relationships work. It's refreshing to see great writing and directing - combined with a quality cast - in independent film.,1480809600,,170,5.333333333333333
