8550906,3,B00AFEYQE2,"This seems to be just edited down from original live TV, British, I suppose.  It is lacking in cohesiveness and oftimes its hard to tell at what stage we are in the race.  Nonetheless, we do see quite a bit of the action.",1368921600,,221,4.116279069767442
8550907,4,B00AFEYQE2,"Excellent race some spectacular video lacking in Radio Lemans commentary. Overall really well done always falls under favorites, when I'm milling around the house I reach for one of my lemans DVDs.",1367193600,,197,5.1875
