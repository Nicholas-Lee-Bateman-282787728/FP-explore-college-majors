Fields shorts and some of the others in this collection are available in other sets with better quality, there are at least 5 shorts that are not easily found elsewhere. If you already have a collection of many silent shorts, you may still want to get this set just for those 5 hard to fine ones.",1505088000,,340,4.328125

8247925,4,B0012VCMRK,"The majority of MCE's SLAPSTICK FESTIVAL are silent movies by Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, Stan Laurel and the Keystone Kops. Also here are the usual public domain two-reelers by WC Fields, Our Gang and the Three Stooges. All but seven of these titles are available on previous MILL CREEK compilations. What's new: ""Easy Street,"" ""The Cure"" and ""The Rink"" starring Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle's ""That Little Band of Gold"" and ""Mabel and Fatty's Married Life,"" Our Gang in ""Waldo's Last Stand"" and a Charley Chase short called ""Bad Boy.""

SLAPSTICK FESTIVAL is jam-packed with great films. My favorites include WC Fields playing dulcimer and singing (in his fashion) of ""The Fatal Glass of Beer,"" the 3 Stooges destroying the legal system in ""Disorder in the Court"" (Bailiff: ""Do you swear...""  Curly: ""Nooo! But I know all the woids!""), Stan Laurel's spoof of the great lover as Rhubarb Vaselino in ""Mud and Sand,"" and the peerless Buster Keaton in everything here! Honorable mention to ""The Stolen Jools,"" which features cameos by several dozen prominent stars of the 1930s.

Although no sign of film restoration is apparent, transfer quality of MCE's public domain movies is uniformly good. Their dual-side recorded discs are housed in gloss-coated heavy paper sleeves. Easy access storage boxes are sturdy and remarkably compact.
