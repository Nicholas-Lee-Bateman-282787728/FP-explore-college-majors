7684250,3,B01CJVITKU,ANDREA BOCELLI CINEMA is a treasure of Italian cinema and American cinema mostly sung in Italian by the great ANDREA BOCELLI. The reduction in stars is due to the fact that there are NO special features. No documentary. No music videos.,1463616000,9,236,4.780487804878049

7684259,4,B01CJVITKU,The concert is great but the DVD cover says the DVD should include the making of the show and 3 bonus videos. These were not included in the DVD so that was disappointing. Otherwise a great show.,1483747200,,195,4.297297297297297

7684269,5,B01CJVITKU,"Great Concert, Filled with Class.  David Foster on the Piano, and behind the Scenes, working with Andrea, Presenters, and Crew on all the details,  David Foster's talent in arranging these concerts, only seems to get better with every single one. Class, Class, Class.
Every Presenter, every Camera Angle is well thought out, to be almost as wonderful to watch, as as actually being there.
This concert also has a Dynamite Tango, performed by a Great Looking Couple, which is Performed to Perfection, and Andrea sings.
Overall, this is a beautifully presented Concert, with wonderful songs that cover Decades of Films, and features a couple duets, as well.
If you love Bocelli, You Will NOT Be Disappointed. He is my Favorite, Absolutely..",1476835200,8,738,5.090909090909091

7684275,3,B01CJVITKU,"Picture quality is not as good as expected for Blu-ray. It's grainy and a bit fuzzy...more like a DVD.

Also, the description of this disc now states:
""Playback Region B/2 :This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.""

But the disc DOES play in my North America player.",1472083200,7,394,4.865671641791045

8753317,5,B01CJVITKU,"Yet another fantastic concert from the incomparable Andrea Bocelli, this time flawlessly performing (music from American and Italian cinema) in 2015 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. This apparently was another PBS special produced by David Foster, who also appears and performs, as in Bocelli's other concerts. As always, the musicality is top notch, wonderful orchestrations and Bocelli's incredible interpretations of some of the most beautiful music ever written for the silver screen. There is also an interesting bonus feature, filmed at Andrea's Italian mansion, in which Foster, Bocelli, and others discuss the making of the album, etc.

The Blu-ray is (apparently) region-free, not Region-B locked as per Amazon's product description. Although I have a region-free Blu-ray player, I was able to play this Blu-ray on a standard, Region-A-locked (U.S. and Canada) Blu-ray player. As expected, the Blu-ray video and audio are perfect!",1500076800,2,943,5.548611111111111
