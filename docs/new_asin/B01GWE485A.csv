8764137,3,B01GWE485A,Do the people who write the specs on the boxes ever actually see the DVD? This is yet another German DVD which boasts an English language track but there isn't one...but there are two versions of the movie on this disc. The German language version is a very poor quality transfer with English language credits and 1.85 aspect ratio. If you go to the Bonus section on the menu and click there you will find a French language version of the movie which is a much better transfer and is the correct 2.35 aspect. Neither version is anamorphic so you have to zoom the image to show it correctly. The movie itself is silly but fun.,1487030400,,625,4.396551724137931
