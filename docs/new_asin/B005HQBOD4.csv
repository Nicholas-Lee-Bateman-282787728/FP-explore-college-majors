Another great film from the British Invasion from VCI.

Check out the VCI spin on this flick:
""When `outsider' Jimmy Harper gets invited to play with the big boys, he can't resist. To fit in with his new found `friends' Jimmy's whole life as a factory worker begins to change and he becomes ""James Harper"", International stockbroker and ace gambler. But what is this game they play that makes them lie to their loved ones? And why do they go to such extraordinary lengths to keep it all a big secret?
Jimmy is in over his head and risks not only humiliation and every last penny he owns, but also the girl he loves... maybe even death itself!
Has he really got the nerve to play...?  THE BIG GAME...""
