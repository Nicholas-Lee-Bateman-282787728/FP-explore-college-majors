8295370,5,B001DXS47E,Great documentary. I purchased for my nephew after visiting my son and the Pensacola Naval Station this summer. He loves it.,1424044800,,124,4.9523809523809526
8295371,2,B001DXS47E,"The description above and on the back specifically state that the tactics of Fighter Weapons School (Top Gun) are discussed.  While this is partially true, the description and the cover make this highly misleading.  What is discussed is the history of fighter aces and the tactics they used in battles from WW1 to Vietnam.  However, FWS was only developed towards the tail end of Vietnam.  While it's obvious that the tactics the aces discuss led to the development of the systematized bag of tricks that ended up being packaged for FWS, again, the description and cover makes it seem as though 4th gen fighter jets and their applications would be explored.  What they describe as graduates is actually totally inaccurate; they follow the precursors to what would later be graduates.  Nothing > mach-speed is explored (and specifically, the fastest jet explored here was the A4 which is barely capable of mach 1).  So, interesting, but ultimately a letdown.",1342656000,6,957,5.018987341772152
8295372,5,B001DXS47E,"Five stars!  The only drawback is that while the F18 is on the cover, it's not in the video.  However, ther are great interviews of several aces and video of their aircraft such as the P51, F86, and F4.  It was made in 1992 and I have to say that if it was made more recently, I would have been reluctant to feature fallen hero Duke Cunningham.  Still a great value for $4.95!",1299110400,3,376,4.109589041095891
