7352552,2,B012IO4TFM,"This is not really a review of the movie but I do want to point out that it is false advertising to say this is a Blu-ray set comes with a 3-D version of the film as it does not! I think Amazon should remove the 3-D designation. The Blu-ray set does come with 3 versions of the film (Theatrical, Extended Cut, and Extended Cut with alternate ending, plus a 2nd disk with the DVD version of the theatrical version. And it does come with a code for the digital version of the film.",1454112000,11,479,4.1063829787234045
7352553,4,B012IO4TFM,"Though I have enjoyed all the entries in the Paranormal Activity series as standalone movies to some degree (part 5, The Marked Ones, is the only one I might say comes close to bordering on dull) the problem is that the last three or four installments have all ended up in more or less the same spot and have failed to move the arching storyline forward in any significant way. Too long have we been teased with subplots that, though obviously connected, have been recycled endlessly and gone nowhere, and its been frustrating. I honestly almost forgot the latest film, The Ghost Dimension, even existed until I happened to see it on the new release endcap at the store, but in spite of my criticisms my curiosity got the best of me and I picked it up blindly. And you know what? Im glad I did!

I won't rehash the entire plot as many others here have done already, but suffice it to say some secrets are at long last revealed and things finally start to move forward and develop more fully, especially where our demon friend Toby is concerned. Now, granted, the ending is still set up to be sequel bait, as I expected it probably would be, but in spite of that I would say this movie still accomplished more on its own than the three preceding it combined. Im actually kind of surprised at all the negativity it has received; this is definitely the one that has revived my interest in the series and Im looking forward to how they handle whats coming next.

With all that said, I don't want to build it up as the greatest thing ever. The characters are somewhat cookie-cutter and forgettable, and the weird little girl trope has grown rather stale in movies like this, but its all serviceable enough for what they were trying to do here and I have certainly seen worse. I will acknowledge the somewhat misleading title of the movie  we don't actually get to SEE another dimension or where the ghosts and demons reside, exactly, but rather we see the entities themselves appear on video for the first time via a special camera that allows such things to be captured on film. So, same setting, really, but with an extra dose of sometimes-questionable CGI. (Im a clairvoyant and see spirits and energies manifest as abstract shapes all the time, and some of it was a little eye-roll inducing even for me, lol.)

I won't get into the subjective argument of whether these movies are still scary. I will admit they may have since lost the edge so brilliantly captured by the first one, but as they become more and more plot-centric and veer away from the jump scares I still think they succeed just fine at setting a certain unsettling overall tone nevertheless. Also, if you're viewing Ghost Dimension at home on bluray, do be sure to check out the deleted scenes, as most of them are pretty good and probably should have made it into the main cut.

But anyhow, long story short, if you have kept up with the series and have liked it, this will probably satisfy you. If you never got into these movies at the start, this one won't change your mind now. If, like me, you enjoy the movies but your interest has strayed along the way, this one may just bring you back into the fold. Not to say the negative reviews don't present any valid points, but looking at this film in the bigger context of the entire Paranormal Activity franchise, I daresay it might actually be the best one since the first one.",1453334400,,3396,4.5064935064935066

7352556,4,B012IO4TFM,This film requires a viewers concentration when the many scenes are presented. Memory of what was seen and heard in earlier scenes need to be recalled for the later scenes to be tied together so a complete presentation of the various scenes can be melded together and understood.,1452816000,,279,4.833333333333333

Toby (or is it Tobi?) is TERRIFYING! I adore this franchise, but I do hope this is the last of the series. You can't have to much of a good thing.
