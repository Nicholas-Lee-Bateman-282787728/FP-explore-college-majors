7887411,5,6305320101,"Jackie Mason was a perfect choice to play Krusty's father, a rabbi who disowned his son for going into entertainment. he gives a wonderfully charismatic showing (""Who's in charge here? There's no-one in charge here?"") as Bart and Lisa attempt to convince him to accept his son's career. Another great moment was Bart's misunderstanding of the phrase ""I have no son!"" (which Homer later repeated in 'The Principal and the Pauper')
Bart the Murderer was another clever concoction. The explanation given as to Skinner's disappearance was so unlikely it was comical, and the representation of the seedy world of Gangland businesmen was satirical and clever. A strongly recommended tape.",979776000,3,682,5.26605504587156
