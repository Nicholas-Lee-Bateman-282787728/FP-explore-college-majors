8084851,5,B000BBOFEK,"A double dose of classic horror. ""House on Haunted"" stars Vincent Price of golden age horror fame as Frederick Loren, a wealthy millionaire who offers 5 people $10,000 each, if they survive the evening that is. This one is the original folks. There was a remake in 1999 starring Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen, which was also a great film. ""Night of the Living Dead"" needs little to no introduction. The original and true zombie flick directed by the king of zombie movies, George A. Romero. For those that may have missed out on this on, the first in Romero's Living Dead series finds a group of stranded citizens stuck in a farm house in the middle of nowhere and fighting for their lives against a horde of the cannibalistic living dead, while also trying to not kill each other. I recommend these if you like zombies, ghostly spirits, or classic films.",1416960000,,857,4.644736842105263
