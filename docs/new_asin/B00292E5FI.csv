8357341,5,B00292E5FI,"First of all this British Movie has close caption. My wife has a hearing problem & has difficulty understanding British Movies because of the accents of the player's words. We own both of the 2 series of Dutchess of Duke Street.
This series follows  a young maid who wants to be a cook. It follows her life from a cook, mistress to the Duke Of Wales to owner of a hotel catering to the elite of British Society. The cast of characters are excellent ranging from Dukes to maids. Each segment tells a story that draws the series together for an excellent tale of British life in the early 1900's",1295308800,3,593,4.390909090909091
