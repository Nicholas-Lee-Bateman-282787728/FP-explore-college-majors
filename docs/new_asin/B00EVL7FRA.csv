8609878,5,B00EVL7FRA,"This is an excellent Aussie TV series with some of the best acting.  Somehow, even though their characters seem ""out there"", the actors bring a realism to them which makes you believe their actions and motivations (most of the time).  The two sisters are fantastic.

Pay heed to the M warning.  Although I do not recall any nudity, there are many sexual situations and this is not a family-friendly series.  I would watch it perhaps with adult children, but not with teens at home.

Most relationships in this show proceed in this order: mutual attraction, sex, children, and then they talk about marriage, but few of them actually get married.

The language is bad, but it is not overbearing as a Showtime or HBO series might be, where every character swears constantly, using profanity and the f-word.  Profanity and the f-word will be found, but sparsely sprinkled in by some characters.

There is no nudity, but plenty of sexual situations and characters in bed (however, not much time is spent filming their actual intimacies).  For me, this is entirely inappropriate for children.

For me, the most disappointing part of season 4 is, the real estate nemesis of the Proudmans is not played by Shaun Micallef.  He plays that part for maybe 5 minutes or less in season one, acting opposite Kat Stewart; and if you have seen their work together on Mr. and Mrs. Murder, then you can appreciate their roles even more.  Unfortunately, the real estate nemesis in season four is uninspired and he pales by comparison to Micallef.

There continue to be gay characters, but their gayness is rarely a part of the series.  Seems like there was a decree from somewhere that 10% of television characters must be gay, so Offspring meets its quota.  I don't recall anyone gayness in this season to be noticeable.

This season's extra features are, for the most part, worthless.  Best special features were ""the Nurses"" in season one.  I recall many of these as being poorly recorded and uninteresting, despite the series being interesting.

Spoiler alert for the 1 star review below.  I don't know why people do that.",1472601600,,2106,4.826815642458101
