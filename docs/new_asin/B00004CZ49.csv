7920104,3,B00004CZ49,"Lance Henriksen has had an interesting career. He has been in classics like NEAR DARK, ALIENS, PUMPKINHEAD, and TV's MILLENNIUM. He's also been in hilarious cheeeze, like MAN'S BEST FRIEND, and THE HORROR SHOW (aka: HOUSE 3). In HORROR SHOW, he plays a cop stalked by a resurrected serial killer named Max Jenke (Brion James from BLADERUNNER and THE FIFTH ELEMENT), who is out for bloody vengeance. THS is loaded w/ memorable scenes -Jenke's execution, the talking turkey, the pregnancy gone wrong- of typical, 80s corn. While Henriksen is good enough in his role, the sheer ridiculousness of this NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET imitation is nearly overwhelming. I especially love Jenke's sinister giggle, and his decision to live in the family's furnace! Worth a viewing on a late-late Saturday night...",1366588800,2,797,5.138461538461539
