3454943,3,B001AMU60G,"I am not deaf, but I have been wanting to learn to sign. This is not for a beginner! And, this has no sound at all.... which i can understand for the deaf, but it would have been nice to hear the words too. If you buy this i would reccomend already knowing some ASL.",1312675200,3,266,3.8545454545454545
3454944,3,B001AMU60G,"This is a useful DVD for those that have a decent knowledge of Sign Language already.  Perfect for those that may have taken a course in the past that left out some useful phrases and situations.  Just be cautious if you are looking for a complete learning program, this is not for that.  It has no sound, no beginner run-throughs, few alternate views, etc. which is ok if you have a decent ASL background, like I said.  They do run through each section several times with slower speeds as well.  As others have said, the camera quality is not the best, but each idiom is explained via text cut-aways on the screen then back to the person signing it.  There are several presenters so you can get different ways to present different phrases plus a fun outtake section.",1286668800,,767,4.521739130434782
3454945,4,B001AMU60G,It was very Educational and it still had alot of fun and humor to it.,1282608000,,69,3.6666666666666665
3454946,3,B001AMU60G,"The quality on this dvd isn't that great.  Apparently it was shot with a digital camera but recorded on analog tape.  Or something similar.  That being said, it's a good DVD.  The information and signing is clearly presented and the ""actors"" are actually pretty funny.  You can tell they are enjoying themselves and that makes it fun to watch.",1219017600,5,343,4.745762711864407
8278050,5,B001AMU60G,"Very powerful and informative for anyone who is deaf, hard of hearing and/or going deaf or just wants to learn sign language, this is for you.",1510876800,,142,4.5

8278055,4,B001AMU60G,Good for all who are interested in fulfilling your mind with educating yourself; it is very thought provoking and enjoyable.,1371254400,,124,5.25
8278056,5,B001AMU60G,"I love this video. The instructors present each word written out, Then they sign it three times. Next, the word is used in a sentence so you can appreciate the context. Learning idioms and phrases is like learning short-hand. It helps you communicate quickly but accurately. I highly recommend it. Specially if you are a beginner like myself.",1356307200,,342,4.913793103448276
8278057,5,B001AMU60G,I recently started using this in conjunction with my beginning and intermediate sign language classes. It clearly demonstrates the phrases. The students like the variety of watching someone else sign other than me. This is a good video for personal instruction and is very helpful for my classes.,1356307200,,296,5.1875
8278058,4,B001AMU60G,Going by some the reviews I was worried about ordering this DVD but I found it to be very nice...not for the very beginner but hopefully EveryDayASL will make more workbooks AND add the glossing under the DVDs etc so we can teach more of their idioms in our classroom plus also make it easier for the beginner as they have hit upon a great idea,1342051200,,344,4.2272727272727275
8278059,5,B001AMU60G,I was very happy with the speedy services for mailing. the order was processed and mailed out immediately on a holiday weekend. The video is great and is a great learning tool.,1327449600,,176,4.53125
