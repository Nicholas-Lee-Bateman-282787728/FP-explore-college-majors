8744682,5,B019CSW2BA,"First, I should say I started buying Bike-O-Vision DVD's before Amazon starting carrying them.  I have over thirty (30) now.  I use them 3 to 5 days a week and have been for a few years.  I have tried others but overall, to me, these are the best.  I started before they had Blu-Ray and the first ones were a little fuzzy.  Their music is okay and I realize with copyrights it might be difficult to come up the something really in time with bike riding.  I can say for sure that I would not be riding like I do without them.  Many times I play my own music and that is how I know they could do better there.  If you have a Blu-Ray player then I would highly recommend going with the newer Blu-Ray versions.  The increase in price is nominal.  If you are looking for something to keep your stationary bike to become bonkers boring I would recommend by all means, go with the Blu-Ray and forget the earlier versions.  I have them and there is now comparison is quality and resolution. I really wish B-O-V would go back to Puerto Rico, St Croix, Mexico and Hawaii and re-make them with much better recording equipment.",1454284800,,1115,4.3125
