4060365,5,B0032K9TBQ,"FINALLY a DVD that my 9 year-old son can follow. We had already tried two other beginning guitars DVDs and they were junk. He was playing the Em Chord the first few days of viewing the DVD. Also the video was extremely helpful with the lesson on ""Horse with no Name."" My son was playing his first song on the guitar in less then a week!",1322784000,,336,4.106060606060606

8387519,5,B0032K9TBQ,Who does not love to play the guitar at the college parties and impress their love. If you are also looking for such performances or even if you are simply a guitar lover then this DVD will help you get answers to so many questions to improve your performance. It is one of the best DIY product that I have come across to help learning a musical instrument like guitar. A great product to buy.,1427673600,,393,4.253333333333333

8387521,2,B0032K9TBQ,"I just received this product. The interior of the case was broke and the DVD was lose. Second, I am unable to access their so called free Ebooks. So far not so good. In addition, during the restring segment the instructor doesn't cover the ""classical"" guitar strings and how to ""tie"" them etc....",1420761600,,296,4.60377358490566
8387522,2,B0032K9TBQ,"THE INSTRUCTOR PLAYED A FEW SONGS BUT NEGLECTED TO SHOW WHICH CHORDS HE WAS USING, NOR DID HE SHOW HOW TO CONSTRUCT CHORDS. AS A BEGINNER YOU RECEIVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS IF WATCHING A MUSIC VIDEO...IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RECEIVE NO USEABLE INSTRUCTION. MAY BE OF SOME VALUE TO ADVANCED STUDENTS BUT FOR BEGINNERS THIS DVD IS WORTHLESS.",1420761600,,334,4.775862068965517
8387523,5,B0032K9TBQ,"I took guitar lessons 20 or so years ago when I was a kid in junior high.  I absolutely loved it but as often happens with hobbies, over time I let it fall to the side and kept meaning to pick it back up.  I finally decided to take the leap and this DVD has been really helpful and easy to follow.  I would suggest it to all beginners or those looking to begin again.  Seems like it would be great for all ages.",1420502400,,411,3.857142857142857
