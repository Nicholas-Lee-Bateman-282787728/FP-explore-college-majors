7928393,5,B00004ZBHH,"This video contains two episodes of the popular and lovable show Road to Avonlea that were joined together to create a sort of film. Don't worry- the joined episodes are 100% related and flow together perfectly! Apparently there is one episode that aired between these two originally, but it is not included on this tape.

Felicity is preparing to marry a different man when she receives the unexpected news that her beloved Gus is still alive. She travels for many days with her Aunt Hetty to reach Gus- only to realize that Gus does not want to return home because of how much he has changed.

I was happy to get this video, as Road to Avonlea has become one of my favorite shows and I wanted to know more about Felicity and Gus's relationship. I highly recommend this video!",1470873600,,777,4.542857142857143
7928394,5,B00004ZBHH,"My grandma got me watching this show and I fell in love with it wish that they would rerun them on TV most of the shows now a days are stupid or gross. All my friends think I'm weird because of it but it wasn't for shows like this I wouldn't love history so much, being in my twenties I know that its odd but I don't care. If you love history and show that are about people and not just sex, drugs, blood and guts you will find yourself falling in love with this show. Suitable for all ages.",1450224000,,491,3.92

7928399,5,B00004ZBHH,"Road to Avonlea is one of my favorite television shows, ever. Not only is it family-friendly, it has positive messages about the importance of family, friendships, and community, and takes us back to a time where life was so much different from today. The lovely Prince Edward Island with its scenic landscape forms the backdrop to the fictional town of Avonlea and its inhabitants. Set in the 1900s, this is a wonderful period drama that has garnered a large following and continues to do so.

In this VHS titled ""Return to Me"", there are two episodes from the final season, i.e. Season 7 of RTA - ""Return to Me"", and ""So Dear to My Heart"". In ""Return to Me"", Felicity King (Gema Zamprogna) is preparing to marry banker Stuart McCrae when she receives a mysterious phone call on the eve of her wedding. She thinks that someone is informing her that the love of her life, Gus Pike (Michael Mahonen, who was presumed dead) has been found alive in South Carolina. Felicity decides she has to check this out and is accompanied by Aunt Hetty (Jackie Burroughs). The pair travel by sea (one of the funniest segments here is watching poor Hetty cope with seasickness!), and eventually Felicity does find Gus, though there is also a shocking revelation. The rest of this episode focuses on how Felicity tries to convince Gus to return to Avonlea with her and Hetty.

In the episode ""So Dear to My Heart"", which is also the final episode of the entire series, Felicity and Gus return to Avonlea. Felicity decides that she has to make some serious decisions regarding the two men in her life - Gus and Stuart. Plans go ahead for Felicity's wedding and in the meantime, Olivia and Jasper Dale make some decisions of their own regarding their future, after the cannery gets burned to the ground. Hetty feels that the Avonlea she loves is changing, and blames her own family when they refuse to go along with her plans to keep things the same, deciding to boycott Felicity's wedding as a result. This episode also features Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley) in a cameo role (she only returned once in Season Six and once in Season Seven).

Die-hard romantics will love these two episodes, though in order to truly appreciate the stories, I would recommend watching this amazing series from the beginning, i.e. Season One, where it all began. A truly wonderful show that will always remain close to my heart.",1291939200,,2388,4.694510739856802
7928400,5,B00004ZBHH,"Words fail me in trying to express how wonderful I think this series is -- And this series finale episode is probably one of the best episodes of the series ... If you're an Avonlea fan, like so many of us are, this is a must-see! Seeing how Gus is found again and how wonderful everything turns out certainly brings a great ending to a great series ....",1176249600,3,354,4.220588235294118
7928401,5,B00004ZBHH,"This is a must-have for anyone who's watched ""Road to Avonlea"".  It is the culmination of seven years in episodes of a television series like no other I've ever seen.  The acting skills of the cast are unsurpassed, and these particular two closing episodes punctuate the quality that this series possesses.

For years, viewers have been watching the young couple, Felicity and Gus, overcome any challenge to be together.  Now that it seems that Gus is lost at sea, and Felicity is engaged to Stuart, it's up to the 'fates' to see the couple joined at last.  We are not disappointed.  Just days before Felicity's wedding, she receives a phone call from Charleston, South Carolina indicating that there's 'someone' needing her, a patient who's been recovering in a local hospital.  Felicity senses that it is Gus, and with nothing to go on but her faith that Gus must be alive, she travels there with Hetty to find him.  Gus doesn't want to face Felicity or what has happened to him.  However, Felicity refuses to return home without him.  At this point, Aunt Hetty steps in and in an incredibly moving scene, (my personal favorite of all the scenes in RTA with Hetty and Gus), challenges Gus to find his courage and take back his indominitable spirit.  Gus Pike cannot resist the longing to be home where his family and his love draw him.

We are just as satisfied to see Gus and Felicity married, and despite Gus being blind, we know he 'sees' as much as we do, with his heart.  Aunt Hetty expresses all of our feelings in her final toast at the wedding when she emotionally seals the appeal of Avonlea, our magical home for seven years.  This series is better in my opinion than any I've seen in the US, and will continue to garner fans far and wide who are introduced to the village of Avonlea and all of the timeless characters.",1106956800,26,1831,4.576687116564417
7928402,5,B00004ZBHH,"As a fan of the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series I immediately fell in love with the ""Road to Avonlea"" characters. In this film which marks the end of the series Felicity must choose between her first and true love Gus Pike or her present fiancee Stuart McCrea. Believing Gus to be dead Felicity accepts Stuart's proposal and prepares to marry him until a mysterious phone call takes her to Charleston SC where she finds Gus alive but not the same as he was before. Through determination and alot of patience she persuades him to go back to Avonlea with her and Aunt Hetty. I will only say that the ending was perfect. I wish the Disney channel or ABC Family would re-run this series instead of Smallville and Gilmore Girl repeats. There are just not enough historically themed shows on television anymore so it is no wonder that today's children care nothing for the past.",1098403200,14,870,4.583333333333333
