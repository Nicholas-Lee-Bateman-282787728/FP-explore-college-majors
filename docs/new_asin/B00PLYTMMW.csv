6817542,5,B00PLYTMMW,This movie is by far the best movie of the century at portraying how Satan works as well as how you as a person who reads to understand and act on Gods Word can not just back him down but defeat him everyday in your lives.,1422835200,3,222,3.847826086956522
6817543,5,B00PLYTMMW,Great movie with redemption!  Trust in the Lord and he will keep you on the path,1422230400,,80,4.0
6817544,5,B00PLYTMMW,"I love how its not all rainbows and Unicorns like other faith movies tend to be. There's actually real, big, serious problems that are in the film that a normal person can relate to and see how to overcome it Gods way, and not mans way. If you believe in God, but cant handle the reality of life for millions of people outside of your bubble, this movie might scare you. If you believe in God, and know the ugliness of the world and want to watch a woman fight it head on, you'll love it.",1421625600,,488,4.09375

6817546,5,B00PLYTMMW,Awesome movie!,1421193600,2,14,6.5
6817547,5,B00PLYTMMW,"The movie is great at showing the goodness of God and the subtlety of the devil.  After seeing this movie I recognized the power of God greater, and as a Christian I saw bigger how I need to believe more in the power God's given us through His son Jesus Christ.  The devil is very subtle in his moves and endeavors to get Christians to settle for a mediocre life or for less than the best - he does not want us to rise to our full potential in Christ. This movie does an amazing job at showing the deliverance that's available through God. The movie is based on a true story and does not have all the glitz and glamour of a Hollywood movie but real life is not a Hollywood movie. It's a simple walk with God. I am very impressed and thankful for the heart and love that was put into making this movie possible and the accuracy of God's Word that was presented.",1420156800,6,860,4.1437125748503
6817548,5,B00PLYTMMW,Loved the new rewrite of the opening.  It drew me right in.  It's great to see how an accurate knowledge of the Bible brings deliverance to people no matter how dark the situation.  It was awesome to see the power of God in operation!,1420156800,5,234,4.2727272727272725
6817549,5,B00PLYTMMW,"Excellent movie!  If you love Gods' Word then you will love this movie.  It is by far the best biblically based and spiritually accurate movie
of the decade!  Not to mention, it is highly entertaining!  You will not be disappointed in your expectations",1419552000,10,252,4.790697674418604
6817550,1,B00PLYTMMW,"Didn't last 10 minutes, and presently searching for a way to get a refund.

The writing is absolute crap. ""Christian"" is not an excuse to make bad art.",1419120000,2,151,4.392857142857143
6817560,5,B00PLYTMMW,I have bought this movie for my parents and they enjoyed the movie a lot. Surprisingly this movie came a week earlier than posted,1442016000,,129,4.416666666666667
6817561,3,B00PLYTMMW,Good movie.  Acting could be better.  What is most captivating is this is based on a true story and shows the goodness of God and the evil of the devil and the deliverance the lead character receives.,1442016000,,200,4.378378378378378
6817562,5,B00PLYTMMW,It was good,1437523200,,11,3.0
6817563,4,B00PLYTMMW,"The acting levels were mixed: some good, some bad. The story, however, overwhelmed any thoughts on the quality of acting. These things happened, so the story is worth watching and watching again. One thing, I thought Michael Madsen was a little old for the part he played, but otherwise, he did an outstanding job. Kristen Quintrall and Jan Santos also did well. The story is especially poignant for those who have lived through something similar.",1435968000,2,447,4.973333333333334
6817564,5,B00PLYTMMW,Loved the movie.,1430956800,,16,4.666666666666667

6817566,4,B00PLYTMMW,This movie is an example of the spiritual battle we are in. I enjoyed it and can say by personal experience that I have no doubt it is based on truth.,1430870400,,150,3.870967741935484
6817567,3,B00PLYTMMW,Too much of the dark side but still a clear presentation of the Gospel.,1430611200,2,71,4.142857142857143
6817568,5,B00PLYTMMW,"Excellent true-to-LIFE movie. Not at all like a jazzed up Hollywood movie (those tend to have exciting details to change a story). I not only enjoy this great movie at home - Last Saturday night, several good friends got together in Penfield, NY and watched it together. If you love God and His Word, this unique movie will bless, inspire and uplift you.",1429660800,,354,4.634920634920635

6817570,5,B00PLYTMMW,"It was a unique and powerful way to show the endless, hopeless, but ever so common flaws and deceitfulness of the ways of the world which is ""180"" from the knowledge and nature of God. There are no flaws and deceitfulness with Him so there must be another power in the world. 1 John 4:4 begins to open up in this movie.",1429228800,4,319,4.161290322580645

6817573,5,B00PLYTMMW,"Tells it like it is,yes the power that that God has given long time ago,is available to the born again believer. It is real. Roman 10 : 9& 10 is just the starting point. I should know for I've scene it happen in my life.",1427760000,,220,3.911111111111111
6817574,5,B00PLYTMMW,"Fantastic film! Very powerful. We have an enemy and he is real, but ""greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world."" It was great to see the power of God overcoming evil and light dispelling darkness in the lives of real, ordinary people. God works in us and fights for us and we truly have nothing to fear. Great movie! I plan on watching it over and over again!",1427414400,,375,4.013333333333334

6817578,5,B00PLYTMMW,"Excellent Christian movie.  Have seen it in the theaters and bought a copy for myself and one for my daughter.  Well done, based on a true story.  Gives a clear picture of the ""dark side"" of life and the deliverances that is available.",1424390400,,235,4.4186046511627906
6817579,5,B00PLYTMMW,"This is a great movie to watch.  Its based on a true story.  Of course, with most Christians movies, the acting is not that great and they are low budget films.  The story of this movie makes it a great movie to watch.",1423785600,,218,4.023255813953488
8688564,4,B00PLYTMMW,Not as high quality as I thought it would be. But good story line.,1532563200,,66,3.7857142857142856
8688565,4,B00PLYTMMW,very interesting of how people can be drawn into the wrong thing,1492387200,,64,4.416666666666667
8688566,2,B00PLYTMMW,"I was rather disappointed in this movie. I understood it was going to be intense, but I wasn't prepared for what I watched. The movie is very dark, but also had good spiritual truth. That isn't enough for me to recommend it. If you are at all sensitive to the spiritual world, this is not for you. Parts are very disturbing. I know that there is truth in what was shown, I personally just didn't need to watch it. The evil was too real, and I didn't appreciate the feeling it gave me. This might be a spoiler for some, but I would have liked to have been warned before watching. There is an animal killed and hung for at least 30 seconds of the movie. And another scene had a girl possessed by demons getting blood all over a room. I turned it off at this point. I'm sure the movie must have had a happy ending, but it was too much for me to get to that point. This is definitely not for young children.",1470009600,,903,4.107344632768362
8688567,5,B00PLYTMMW,"Great movie and the guy that's running the Bible program he is from my Ministry, The Way Ministry",1462060800,,97,4.444444444444445
8688568,5,B00PLYTMMW,This movie very accurately portrays how Satan and God work.  You can see evil influences even through physical objects that can be open doors for the adversary to attack.  That is why we need to keep our homes and lives spiritually clean by removing any ungodly object in our home.  The principles of the word of God are clearly demonstrated throughout the film.,1461024000,,362,4.714285714285714
8688569,5,B00PLYTMMW,"Refuge From The Storm is different from anything I've ever seen before .... This tell the story of a person's spiritual battles without the cheesiness of other movies like The Exorcist .... deliverance is as simple as believing the promises of God and acting accordingly ... in spite of any subtle, satanic influences that try to stop you.  The impact that God's Word had on Linda, which was also a witness to Steve, was incredible.  The making of the movie was also miraculous, so don't ignore the Specials Features section.",1455321600,,525,4.822222222222222
8688570,5,B00PLYTMMW,Loved this movie!! saw it in theater with a large group. So glad to see it is finally on DVD and I can buy it!,1452816000,,110,3.44
8688571,5,B00PLYTMMW,one of best movies  ever seen if you are spiritually aware of something more than just the 5 senses,1452038400,,99,4.2105263157894735
8688572,1,B00PLYTMMW,"no it was very disturbing to my daaughter about demonic things dissappointed too much .some people could handle it but not her wish i had never bought the movie thankyou

8688573,5,B00PLYTMMW,Our group got together and watched this incredible movie.  Truth and knowledge is powerful when it is applied spiritually and this movie shows what can be done when you take beliving action on the Word of God.,1444694400,,209,4.648648648648648
