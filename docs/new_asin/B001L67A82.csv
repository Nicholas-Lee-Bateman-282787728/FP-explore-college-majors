8317444,1,B001L67A82,"This is probably the second worst next Michael Moor's stuff. I would not simply call this bad; it is beyond being just bad. At least you would know it's bad, but this is completely dishonest!

This show distorts what is illegal and what is legal. It is full of ""facts"" presented as if they were facts; it mixes law abiding citizens and gangbangers as if they have got and used their guns in the same way.

Read ""More Guns and Less Crime"", which is one of the best and most scientific book on guns.

This is simply worse than garbage because garbage is simply useless while this is poisonous.",1302739200,,591,4.4036697247706424
8317445,2,B001L67A82,"I just finished watching this and I gave it two stars because I thought it would be so biased to begin with that my expectations were set to low.

With that said, there were some high points such as the reasons law abiding people have arms: For self defense and personal enjoyment. The Second Ammenment is treated as what it is - the guarantee of a natural right of a free people. However, each rational segment was predictably refuted by gun crime in the ghetto. ""You are good law abiding citizins who protect your families BUT look what happens in the hood.""

Those people do not follow gun laws! Easy and simple fact, yet when the Philly Cop bemoans that nothing ""will change unless the Legislature does something"" it sounds silly, illogical and petulant. We need gun control on the people who are decent to stop the gang bangers who don't follow laws? What??

We don't need gun control, idiots, we need CRIME CONTROL. Didn't your Vassar journalism class teach you logic? Bias as journalism is easier and fits your world outlook I suppose...",1257120000,2,1044,4.663043478260869
8317446,1,B001L67A82,"This particular episode reminds me of the Frontline series on PBS.  Horribly biased and full of errors.

Gun owners are portrayed as uneducated rednecks, psychopaths, or scared citizens who live in fear.  Gone is the give and take, the DEBATE on the extent or lawfulness of gun laws.  The statistics of California (the strictest state) and Texas (the state with the least strict gun laws) should have been used.  QUANTIFIABLE information should have been presented.

If you are an educator I would say that it is the high point of irresponsibility to show this episode to a class.  Gun ownership is common in America and invariably, a student(s) would know better (or would be taught the issues by a relative) and a teacher would loose all credibility.  As an example, NATGEO's definition of an assault weapon is way off.  Anyone with access to Wikipedia would soon find out the real definition.  This program is full of errors of commission and omission.  This leads me to believe that the producers of this program have no interest in a debate but furthering their own views at the expense of public discourse.

This show is crap.",1255305600,2,1132,4.808290155440415
8317447,2,B001L67A82,"Since views on guns are so polarized, this work tries to speak to audiences with divergent views.  It showed an all-American wife and mother who wanted to keep her family safe.  However, it also said a person is 22 times more likely to kill a relative than an intruder.  It showed gang members and I assume many viewers wouldn't want them to have guns.  It quotes the Second Amendment but ends by saying a child accidentally kills him- or herself with a gun every other day.  This work reminded me of that hilarious episode of ""The Simpsons"" on guns.  Marge leaves the house in protest of a gun, but then keeps the gun by the end.  Homer states, ""This gun cost me everything I love except my precious, precious gun!""  They show a man who shoots two burglars who were next door, rather than breaking into his home.  The 911 respondent told him not to shoot, but he did it anyway, and worse didn't get prosecuted for it.  It showed father's spending Father's Day with minors at a gun range.  The Rosie O'Donnell in me was totally sickened by that.  The work is diverse in terms of gender, race, and age as well.  Still, it said nothing new.  I doubt most Americans couldn't quote the arguments here.  Maybe some government class in a high school could use this, but the work was sooooo general.  I usually learn a lot in watching National Geographic works, but this taught me close to nothing.  It beat a dead horse in countless ways.",1242172800,2,1432,4.467181467181467
