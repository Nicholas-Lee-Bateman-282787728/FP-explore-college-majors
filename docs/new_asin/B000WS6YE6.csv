2990493,5,B000WS6YE6,"I am part of a Catholic mens discussion group and Steve's Video has started a continuing discussion about the Church fathers. How could anyone deny that the Catholic Church was started by Jesus Himself after reading 2000 years of His teachings through Ignatius, Polycarp, and many many more.",1235433600,7,291,5.083333333333333
2990494,4,B000WS6YE6,"Aside from a few rather cheesey puns, this is an interesting and well-produced documentary on the Apostolic Fathers.  Stephen Ray enthusiastically hosts this biography and travelogue of Ignatius of Antioch, Ireneus of Lyons, Clement of Rome, and Justin Martyr.  Ray is especially suited as host in that it was the study of the Apostolic Fathers that led him to convert from Baptist to Roman Catholic.  Traveling to the cities where the Apostolic Fathers served the church, Ray gives us a feel for their world and their lives.  Through it, we grow more in love with these heroes of the faith and with the church as a whole.  This is an ideal source for a young adults group in order to build this faith with their desire for action and adventure.  It is a quality production of a part of church history that will excite Christians of any age - Protestant as much as Catholic.  In the end, even the silly puns only add to the charm of this one in a series of quality productions.",1204243200,22,977,4.548571428571429

8225368,5,B000WS6YE6,We have really enjoyed the entire Footprints of God series - our children watch them all the time.  They are interesting for everyone in our family from 2 all the way up to the adults.  This has been one of our favorites from the series - the discussion of the early martyrs of the church and the discussion of the fundamental beliefs and Roman allegiance of the early Church Fathers was especially enlightening.,1238371200,9,412,4.63013698630137
8225369,2,B000WS6YE6,"My faith has been nurtured a great deal over the years from reading the Apostolic Fathers; I was excited to discover this video, and hoped that I would be able to use it as part of our church's confirmation program. But I was quite disappointed.
It's not the blunt Roman Catholic perspective; that I understand and even respect. If that were the only issue, I probably would still have used some scenes.
My problem with this video was severe and threefold: a looseness with documented facts (poor fact-checking? - or just inattention to implications of the script?); consistent overstating what we really know about these guys (legend trumping honest appraisal); and sheer hokey-ness.
One crystal clear and easily explained fact-error: the narrator clearly states that the statue of Athena *inside* the Parthenon (""Athena Parthenas"") could be seen miles out to sea from Athens, rather than naming the statue *outside* the Parthenon (""Athena Promachos"") as the one clearly visible to sailors.
The overstatement of fact pervades the video. I am a devout Christian, and I have no problem with presuming that our sources for the lives of these gentlemen were generally honest Christians, reporting what they believed to be the truth. But stating flat out that Ignatius was born in 30AD, and repeating the (very late) legend that Ignatius was the child Jesus blessed? Or portraying Clement as wearing full papal regalia? C'mon!
Finally, the hokeyness and cheesiness isn't just from the low-budget production budget. That would be understandable. But clearing some brush with a bulldozer and using that as an example of spiritual ""trailblazing""? And the voice-actors reading the writings of the Father's are consistently just, well...bad. Over-emoted. Corny. Nearly unwatchable, and I really like the subject matter.

I gave it 2 stars rather than only 1 because the on-location filming is quite helpful to the story telling. But still not worth purchasing.",1238198400,11,1951,5.233226837060703
