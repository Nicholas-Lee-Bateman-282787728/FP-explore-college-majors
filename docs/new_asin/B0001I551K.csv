2004527,1,B0001I551K,This movie sets a new bar for special effects in an Asian film. F/X are on a level with the latest Star Trek and Star Wars films. Unfortunately this is a poor quality DVD. The subtitle timing is slightly off and the picture quality is highly compressed. I'd wait for a different/better version,1313107200,11,293,4.547169811320755
2004528,4,B0001I551K,"The classic Japanese anime ""Space Battleship Yamato"" was actually a TV series ""Uch senkan Yamato"" (1974-1975) & was edited down to a 2 hour movie. It was followed by four more anime movies & two more full length TV series (Cosmic Empire & The Bolar Wars).So,if you are a fan of this genre you will probably enjoy this live action version of earth`s last chance voyage to Iscandar aboard a converted WWII Japanese Battleship.
  I was looking foward to seeing this movie back in 2009 when I first heard about it & saw the teaser trailer online. Lucky for us fans the movie is not all CGI effects & no story. The pace is fast moving but does allow time for us to get to know the main characters. Yes,alot of the story was changed but it did seem to make sense why it was done. There is plenty of original stuff for the super-fans to enjoy & even some crossover stuff from the Cosmic Empire Storyline.(Super-Geek-fans will know!)
  But onto the actual DVD. Yes it works in my Region 1 DVD player & yes it has english subtitles. The one I recieved however has just reasonable picture quality,alot of pixelation in the background. Definitely watchable but doesn`t seem like a high quailty transfer. Being a big fan I had to get this movie right away & if this is the only way to see it,so be it. Or maybe I just got a bad copy? Just so everyone knows.",1313107200,,1345,4.368
2004529,4,B0001I551K,"This DVD lives up to it's expectations. For American fans of Space Battleship Yamato, adapted into Star Blazers at the height of the Star Wars craze circa 1979, there will be no disappointment whatsoever. Being one of those fans that saw the toned down dubbed English version I have been following the series ever since. My background with the series may be more extensive as I have no problem watching the original with sub-titles so take that as you may.

It was with mixed reservations that I finally got to see the December 2010 movie adaptation of my childhood favorite cartoon. Having seen it twice now I can tell you two truisms:

1. It has been worth the wait.
2. The movie was made by fans of the original show.

If you have been a close follower of the show, the first 30 minutes plays such a homage to the original I am almost naming my goosebumps. The story-line, characters, ship, soundtrack, action flow, practically the entire first episode including camera angles, has been beautifully recreated. At around 2 hours to cover the original 26 ""Quest To Iscandar"" episodes I think this has been a beautiful homage to fans of the original series or it's American counterpart. Wildstar (US) or Shima (JA) still has his growth period but is the central character. The only really changed character is IQ9 whose transformation to the big screen couldn't have been better done. Sane (US) or Sato (JA) even still has his cat and famous ""spring water.""

The Good: As mentioned above and special effects. IMDB reports 15 million spent on the movie, primarily on special effects. Quite frankly I find that impossible. What I saw, rivaled Avatar.

The Bad: Storyline, is radically departed by the end of the movie (sequel possibilities would only involve Andromeda if you take my meaning).

The Interesting:
1. Import only so sub-title English and Chinese only.
2. Product was ordered through Amazon (Asian Entertainment (DVD))on a Monday and arrived Wednesday with standard delivery options.
3. Product is stated as being all region DVD. Tried on Region 1 with no problem whatsoever.
4. Regular DVD came with no special features.

Final word: Absolutely loved it.",1311465600,194,2166,4.885558583106267
2004530,1,B0001I551K,i had the same experience as a previous reviewer: the DVD will not play on any machine we have in the house.,1236556800,3,108,3.9545454545454546
2004531,4,B0001I551K,"Space Battleship Yamato was the source material for the anime that would become known in the U.S. as Star Blazers.  This movie takes the twenty-six episode series and whittles it down to a 135 minute film, only using the sections of the series that are absolutely necessary to tell the main story of the series (the Earth being polluted by the Planet Gamilus, the crew of the rebuilt Yamato making the 148,000 light year voyage to Iscandar to get a neutralizer to rid Earth of the pollution... and must accomplish it all within one Earth year).

This isn't bad for what it is, which is an overview film for the first season.  The DVD release also includes the original theatrical trailer and alternate animation footage (both of which are subtitled), the original program book (which is translated), a gallery of promotional art, and a history behind the Yamato franchise.",1195171200,7,872,4.8389261744966445
2004532,2,B0001I551K,"Space Battleship Yamato is one of the seminal anime films -- arguably, without the Yamato juggernaut launched by the movie (remember, the TV show did poorly, and it was only with the compilation, that Yamato fandom really began to take off), Gundam, Macross, Urusei Yatsura and all of the other greats of anime may not have been made.

The film is OK, good but not great. As a two-hour movie spliced together from 48 or so half-hours of TV, it has a very rushed feel to it, and you don't get a sense of the crew as a unit. It'd probably help viewers to see the Space Battleship Yamato TV series (or failing that, Star Blazers) to get a firm grip on each character and their relationships with one another and the plot as a whole. That being said, the film does hit the highlights (including the spectacular battle in the Seven Color Nebula) and still manages to give a sense of epic, grand adventure.

Where the disc takes a nose-dive is, well, the disc itself. Mine will not play on any of my DVD players -- and I exchanged the disc at least three times (once through Voyager themselves, and a couple of times at Suncoast). On one player, it plays fine until the layer change, and then the picture breaks up dramatically. On all my other players, the disc won't read at all. I am not buying another Voyager disc after this, since the encoding was so shoddy.",1114041600,27,1358,4.428
2004533,5,B0001I551K,"I first saw ""Star Blazers"" (the US version of ""Space Battleship Yamato."") when I was in Junior High. I will never forget it. It is still present in my thoughts even now 20+ years later. This is  perhaps the greatest story, legend, adventure I have ever had the pleasure  of watching. Yes, I know sometimes the animation is well lame compared to  modern shows. Yes, I know sometimes the English dub is well, banel at best.  But, but the story here is epic. It is the deep in the best ways. It gives  one hope that people will be like that in the future. In the same way  ""Lord of the Rings"" and the Arthurian Legends give one hope for  society so does the Starforce. I don't know what else I can say other than  no other movie or series has ever impressed me so much. Some have come  close, ""Babylon 5"" did anyway. I never missed an episode of  ""Star Blazers."" If I could rate this movie more than 5 stars I  would. It is in the top 5 of movies I love not because of glorious visuals  nor of incredible lines, but because the story is still intriguing and  beguiling even 20 years later. I have not forgotten you Yamato!

2004562,3,B0001I551K,"For someone who actually saw the animated version of this film, I was disappointed. In fact in most cases where the Japanese Production company attempts to make a movie from an animated series, My experience, it has been disappointing.
Still it was fun to watch and I was curious to see how it would turn out. It was okay, just not what I was expecting from the film.",1520812800,,367,4.411764705882353

2004566,5,B0001I551K,"I loved growing up watching Star Blazers so I was excited to see a movie version of it brought to life. It's all in Japanese, so unless you enjoy reading sub titles through a whole movie, it probably won't be for you. The CGI is awesome, but you would expect it to be. It's not exactly true to the original American story line of Star Blazers but it still makes for a good movie. And I hate it when they take male roles and put women in there place. The Dr. is now a women and that does not play good when the Dr. was a drunk through the entire original series. IQ9 was over done as well which made that a little more disappointing. Overall it's a good movie and I'll watch it over and over, but the subtitles ruin it. IT really needs to be dubbed over. Better yet, there needs to be a more accurate American made version produced.",1519257600,2,831,4.135802469135802

2004573,4,B0001I551K,"As an old fan of Space Cruiser Yamato and the later American adaptation Star Blazers, it was pretty cool to see that iconic series brought to life. Though I'm a fan of subtitles, the dubbing here isn't painfully bad, though it's pretty obvious how the story ends. Come on, it's Japanese so be ready for lots of self-sacrifice. Somehow, the Space Marines sounding like extras from The Expendables was actually hilarious. Just like the anime, characters die here and that was as it should be. The design of the Yamato was perfect and the Wave Motion Gun was everything over the top I hoped it would be. I admit, Kodai and Yuki annoyed me a bit, but the rest of the crew were awesome. All in all, a great popcorn and soda afternoon flick.",1507334400,6,735,4.492537313432836

Great special effects.

2004598,5,B0001I551K,"I thought this was exceedingly well done. There's no way everything from hours of the show could be included in a 2 hour movie. That's how these things are done, and some people will never be happy. The people complaining here are the same ones who complained about LOTR leaving stuff out as if  9 hours of movie isn't enough for anybody. This stayed true to the plot, and took a few cinematic liberties that I think enhanced the film and added some twists you wouldn't expect, and in fact, improved on the original plot. People are entitled to their opinion, and I'm sure another director may very well have produced a different film, but all in all, this was well worth watching, and is as good as any other movie out there you may be inclined to watch.",1492473600,3,755,4.431654676258993

2004600,4,B0001I551K,"I watched the TV show when it was on here and liked it. I was pleased to find this live version. I did go into it with caution as i knew the adaptation ofa entire series (season 1) into a single movie would mean a lot of overhaul. I also expected it to be closer to the original Japanese series and not influenced by any US modifications.

Going in knowing that, it will be a bit easier to figure out the Japanese names from the US anime versions (ie Derrick Wildstar is Susumu Kodai
and Nova is Yuki Mori.) Also as the series was very male dominated with only one female crewman, a few were gender swapped for the film. No biggie. Like most sweeping sagas adapted to film, this mat have been done better as a trilogy.
The Gamalons are shown as seemingly more feral and look quite different, more alien. Queen Starsha of Iscandar is also handled quite differently, but more logically for this version, I guess.

The effects are good but not great. There are too few battle scenes, kind of a mainstay in the series.

Worth while for fans, not sure if those unfamiliar will get as much out of it",1491868800,,1093,4.321951219512195
2004601,3,B0001I551K,"Beautiful CGI and artwork, but everything is wrong. (spoilers ahead)  The enemies are not humanoid, they are a hive mind.  Iscandar is not it's own planet, but instead the princess is just an orb of light in the center of the Garmillas planet. and Kodai kills himself as well as destroying the Yamato at the end to save everyone.",1490227200,,329,4.559322033898305
2004602,5,B0001I551K,"I remember watching Star Blazers when it first aired in America in 1979 everyday at 4pm on San Francisco's Captain Cosmic.  It was epic.  It remains burned into my pop-culture psyche from my youth.  Watching Space Battleship Yamato made me feel like a 7 year-old kid again and I was grinning from ear-to-ear.  Seeing the Yamato (Argo) come to life and the characters come alive was like magic and really took me back. One thing to keep in mind is that the characters/names are  their original Japanese names such as Susumo Kodai (Derek Wildstar) Captain Okita (Captain Avatar), Yuki Mori (Nova) and the Gamillas (Gamilons), etc. so American Star Blazers fans should keep that in mind when watching.  I thought the special effects were quite good in particular the wave-motion gun effect was quite spectacular looking and there were several scenes with the Yamato that made my jaw literally drop and the appearance of the analyzer robot IQ-9 was quite pleasing for the fans.

Of course there are some major plot points from the series that were altered/changed.  I'm sure die-hard fans will nitpick them to death and remain disappointed by the changes but since I only had my 40 year old memories of the show to go from, they didn't really bother or distract from my enjoyment of the film.  Every television show that is given the blockbuster film treatment has to abbreviate major plot points down into only 2 hours so changes to the 26 episode season narrative to make them work in a feature film format are inevitable.  Some of the major criticisms are quite understandable.  Desler (Desslok) is supposed to be the main villain and he's barely in it (although I thought the special effect of him appearing as a crystalline holographic image was pretty impressive), Queen Starsha of Iscandar is basically just an alien entity that possesses Yuki (Nova) to deliver a few lines of plot exposition.  I won't spoil the ending but it probably would have worked better if they had set it up for a sequel instead of jumping from the Quest for Iscandar storyline of season 1 into adapting certain elements from season's 2's Comet Empire and the Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato feature film.

As a stand-alone film, Space Battleship Yamato works and is highly entertaining and if you grew up watching the Japanime cartoon you should enjoy seeing those memorable characters brought to life before your eyes.

While I could tolerate the enemy ship designs being different, or the wave motion capsule not being delivered by Sasha, having Captain Okita basically MAKE UP the mission really annoyed me.  Worse than that, however, was the way in which Gamilas and Iskandar were portrayed.  Gone is the huge surprise of finding out that we are all humans with merely differently-colored skin.  Gone was the conflict of pacifism vs. self-defense... With the aliens basically reduced to androids and disembodied energy beings, all sense of empathy is gone.

Also, THE PACING in this film (must like the first Attack on Titan movie) IS TERRIBLE.  Scenes where we should be feeling pressed for time are so overly drawn-out as to be anti-climactic.  It feels like the director trying to beat us over the head.  Meanwhile the sense of urgency and the time-crunch to reach Iskandar and return is largely absent.

So yeah, the Yamato itself looks cool, the characters are largely OK, but the moral, the soul of the original is all but absent unless you count a couple lines from ""Starsha"" about the Iskandar and Gamilas being two sides of the same coin as sufficient.

2004689,5,B0001I551K,"Growing up watching Derek Wildstar go toe-to-toe with Desla et al, was the highlight of my after-school, cartoon lineup.  It was a fantatstic series then, and there wasn't anything like it.  Fast-forward a few decades later, and this live action, sci-fi Japanese epic, is well...a welcome site for me.  With the average American-made sci-fi film chunking in at $120 million, this adaptation of a huge anime classic looks pretty decent at $22 million (I believe the largest budget of any Japanese-made film).  A lot of attention was paid to the sets, costumes and effects shots (somewhere around 500 or so), but the biggest payoff for me came in the story and the integration of the characters.

Look, Japanese films are replete with emotion and human drama - and SBY is no different.  Having said that, the acting is over-the-top...a lot; and yes, the crew loves to drink...a lot, and YES they shout...a LOT, but it's par-for-the-course.  There are certain things one can expect to witness in a Japanese action film, so as long as you go into it realizing that you're not looking at a Japanese, stylized acting version of American sci-fi ship commanders of most notable movies and TV shows, then you'll get along just fine with your popcorn, Fritos and orange Crush soda.  :-)

This move starts out of the gate with a REALLY nice, VFX-laden space battle that is reminiscent of the opening battle sequence in Revenge of the Sith, where Anakin and Obi-Wan are en route to rescue the Chancellor.  The hundreds of ships in space and more energy bolts.  It's LOADED with fast-paced action, decent effects and serves as an instant flashback to the original cartoon series.

The production value is unmatched in live-action, Japanese sci-fi...hands down.  The look & feel of the sets, the cinematography (especially in the opening sequence and on the ground, while Kodai is scavenging around), the blend of action and story is really nice.  Granted, this IS Japanese drama, so there are quite a few scenes where the human element & emotional components are milked for everything they're worth.  In other words, the director was very skillful in stretching out scenes a little longer than most would be accustomed to, in order to maximize the emotional interactions of the story and the characters.  It doesn't take long to build up a scene, but it sure takes a lot longer to get out of it and move to another.

Great action, effects and story.  I have to say, that I think they were running a little low on funds when they were inside the planet Iscandar, to retrieve the anti-radiation device.  Aside from that, this movie has all the elements of a great sci-fi classic.  It's a pop-corn flick that wonderfully pays homage to the anime classic of the 70's.

2004697,2,B0001I551K,"It would have made a good film, but instead, we got a meshmash of the first animated movie and the final battle of the Comet Empire--without the Comet Empire??? As well, they changed the enemy, villain Desslock, and his minions the Gamilons into some kind of hive mind entity populated with numerous drones; think Age of Ultron...and Ultron's seemingly infinite robot selves. Further, the mysterious Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar, has been changed. Those changes, in terms of how we see her, I didn't mind so much, as it worked visually. Of course, the planet Iscandar, is a far off world...carrying the secret to, and for, the continued survival of the Earth, via a technology that can heal our world from a nonstop bombardment of radiation filled meteors (planet bombs) that the Gamilon Empire have been using to destroy the planet. The great thing about the original films and series, were the fact that they set out exhibiting the Gamilons as villains, but then turned the dynamic 180 degrees, by revealing their lives to be as valid and worthy as our own; and that somehow too, out of desperation and great need, the Gamilons were also victims of a war that they caused. This created a great irony. The makers of the live-action film failed to understand or convey that here, leaving the Gamilons as typical and flavorless throwaway Hollywood prop villains. As per Desslock, in the original Yamato anime movie and series, Aka Star Blazers in the West, a creation that pre-dates Star Wars, and clearly inspired George Lucas, Desslock was very much Darth Vader, before Vader--and his Empire, much like that which we came to know in Star Wars. What made the Gamilons interesting, is that they were humanoid too, just like us, and wanted to live, were scared, and had families, just like us--so when they died, there was real emotional weight; such as when a Gamilon pilot attached his fighter to the Yamato and blew it up, leaving a hole inside of the battleship, and killing many crew members. That pilot, although the enemy, sacrificed himself for the greater good of his people, thus it was powerful to see the loss and bravery from the perspective of both sides. These weren't the actions of a Hollywood villain, but were informed by the events of World War II, hence the name Yamato, a famed Japanese warship lost in the war. The live-action film forgot all of that, and instead gave us a hero (Derek Wildstar in the West), who was collecting metal scraps, because somebody wanted to give him an unnecessary backstory, when he already had a perfectly serviceable one--he lost his brother in war, that was enough. The first act of the new film works, but after that, when the new writers tried to make the story their own, that is when they lost the film. Next, as I previously mentioned, they gave us the ending of the Comet Empire saga, absent the Comet Empire, something that seems to be a wasted plot here, that could, and should have, been used for a sequel. Additionally, what was great about Desslock, unlike Darth Vader, is that he, Desslock, was very much Caesar, from ancient Rome. He was spoiled and a psychopath, yet very clever and brilliant. He was a worth enemy, and I loved to see Desslock, a David Bowie type, and his eccentric manner. Desslock was clearly cracking up mentally, and that added to his  complexities, so that when lastly our hero triumphs over him, it was truly something to see, for Desslock fell like a poetic telling of a tragic Roman leader. In going, he also showed great sympathy for his enemy, giving the moment even more emotion, something that was completely unexpected. Spoiler Alert: They allowed Nova to live here, and that served to undermine Wildstar's sacrifice that we witnessed at the climax of the Comet Empire storyline. Nova and Wildstar were a space Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers...who would die together, for Mother Earth, and their fellow humans, crew, and for, and with, the Yamato. That was as powerful as a story could get, however, and sadly, the live-action filmmakers altered it for no good reason, only giving us half of the sacrifice, hence greatly watering the impact down, and what the original creator was expressing. War comes with great sacrifice, even for heroes.",1466035200,3,4253,4.810109289617486

After watching, I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Special effects are VERY well done.  Maybe this is just the snob in me, but I'd say the Yamato itself (or the ""Argo"" for us old timers) looked a bit CGI. But not enough to distract from my overall enjoyment of the movie. If I had one complaint it would be the subtitles. I do wish there were a fully dubbed version, since having to read words across the bottom of the screen tends to takes your eyes away from the action - and for a fast paced outer space adventure like this one, that's critical! I think you can get away with subtitles much easier in a slower-paced conversation-based drama, but for sci-fi, you kind of want to be watching the space ships, not moving your eyes away from the action. But this too was a small price to pay for what is overall, again, is a VERY well done remake of my favorite old cartoon. The characters were well done, the plot line consistent to the original, and it absolutely kept my attention throughout. I feel if Hollywood had done this movie instead, they would have taken many artistic liberties which would not have resulted in as authentic of a final product. Very pleased.

2004724,4,B0001I551K,"Fans of the old Starblazers cartoon show  one of the earlier Japanese animation shows to really fire imaginations in the west  will be in some form of fanboy 7th heaven with this live action release which takes the premise of the animated show whereby the ship must travel from earth to some distant planet to get succour for the human race which is at war with alien invaders. All the cool stuff is here but of course for fans of the cartoon series there is of course the way ship would warp through space and, cooler than a cool thing on its coolest day ever is the wave motion gun. All topped off with the fact that the ship is of course based on the Yamato. For that ten year old boy that lives inside every man this is pretty much a triumvirate of gleeful, idiot-grin inducing nirvana.

The movie is of course in Japanese. But the dubbing on my edition was fine. They obviously didn't have the budget of a Titanic or an Avatar but by gosh whatever they had they used to maximum effect. One thing that struck me was not only how good the special effects were but how the whole thing had been intelligently put together to maximise the visual effects  as in you didn't get the feeling as in so many films that the whole thing was being propped up by the effects. The editing and scene flow really needs to take a bow on this film.

Plot wise its fairly simple when you boil it down. Its pretty much just the idea that earth is getting slammed so they go blazing away across a great distance (one slight failing is that the journey itself doesnt really feel epic but they could never match the distance creating nature of the cartoon series) and then they get to their destination, grab the swag and head back to earth as triumphant heroes. There are a range of character interactions and some subplots within those interactions and most of them are handled concisely and resolved fairly satisfactorily. The inevitable love interest is, well, inevitable but some tender moments do make it tolerable and while there are some moments of stilted acting in the interpersonal side of things it isn't fatal to the film. Though if the chap playing the captain  Tsutomu Yamazaki  was any more wooden hed be at risk of someone trying to make a lovely desk out of him. Sure, some of these plot devices are  almost mandatory  but anyway, as per the stilted acting in parts this isn't fatal.

More damaging is the over the top sentimentality of some of the death and or separation scenes which is more likely a cultural thing. Lets face it, huge swathes of Asiatic cinema has this issue. Some editing here would have been useful as the move moves towards the 2hrs 10mins mark and a few minutes could have been pared from these types of scenes. In particular the seemingly interminable time it takes them to make their final arrangements when the viewer knows that the evil bad dudes are preparing to launch a missile thats gonna make planet earth bleed and scream and suffer righteously and they waffle on endlessly. I found myself saying aloud the world meanwhile repeatedly..

Overall this is a very good movie on a whole range of fronts. It takes a much loved story (by a certain type of person) and gives it a live action spin. The budget and so many aspects of shooting were intelligently thought out and put together, the plot is simplicity itself but works as a hook and the special effects were better than you may have feared. Acting is OK and sure the film could have used a trim here and there but this is a fun film for science fiction fans  beyond the ready-made audience of fans of the animated original.

2004733,5,B0001I551K,"Worth checking out for what you weren't able to see if you saw the original series as the US-dubbed STAR BLAZERS.

I grew up watching the original series back when they showed it in the States, so it was great collecting the DVDs from the series and all the subtitled films that they had during the 1970s and '80s.

Understanding that the first Yamato movie is, in fact, the condensed version of the first season (Quest for Iscandar), if you were like me and only got to see what US censors allowed in the TV episodes, you are in for a surprise!  I don't want to say too much due to possible spoilers, but if you remember certain scenes, you're about to see them in the feature film the way they were meant to be shown.

Recommendation: HIGH.  They say that Space Battleship Yamato set a new standard for Japanese anime, and even though not many shows or films catch my attention these days, I can believe them; I still enjoy the series today, even the latest 2199 reboot (2012).  That's what makes Yamato so great:  it stays with you in ways other so-called anime ""classics"" don't.",1454976000,,1082,4.461928934010152

2004739,3,B0001I551K,"I really wanted to love this movie for nostalgia reasons but I can't.  I can only like it and then only because I was a fan of Star Blazers.

The Pros:  From memory, it seems to hold true to the original.  Most of the characters seem true and the Yamato looked great and the battle scenes are nicely done.  But...

The Cons:  The battle scenes, and the Yamato itself aren't seen anywhere near enough or the scenes are way too short and the action cut scenes too quick.  I thought the musical score was too loud and intrusive at times to the point of being distracting.  It was as if it was trying to compensate for the acting being unable to draw out an emotional response from me.  When watching the dubbed English version (I also tried Japanese with English subtitles), it felt as if most of the English voice actors weren't quite emotionally connected to the characters, I don't know how else to explain it.  Also, it was as if most of the female voices actresses had the voices of teenage girls and it just sounded juvenile.

As far as the acting and the script, it's probably B movie at best or as if it was an average Scy-Fy movie channel movie.  Some character/drama scenes were unnecessarily drawn out.  Hard to tell about the actual acting, it definitely sounded better and seemed more emotionally connected when listening to the Japanese with the subtitles.  The problem was that the subtitles only spelled out about 1/3 - 1/4 of was actually being said (I switched back and forth from Japanese with subtitles to English).  Watching dubbed English has its own (lipsync) issues.  I also thought the ending was long and drawn out and wrong for the movie (that is if you are used to seeing Star Blazers).

Quick summary, heavy on the drama, skimpy on the space battle scenes.  Decent visual effects.  Average acting if you are watching the dubbed English version.  Another ten minutes of decently done space battles would have been nice.  Worth paying to watch if you are/were a fan, otherwise you might be disappointed.",1454284800,5,2027,4.619047619047619

2004744,4,B0001I551K,"As other reviews may go into the plot in excruciating detail, I'll skip that.  For me, I'll give you my take on being a casual fan of the series, but watching it with my family, who where walking in blind.  Is this film for everyone?  In short, I think overall that answer is yes.  This will play as an adventurous scifi film even without having any knowledge of the original manga/anime.  This film felt like it kept true to the overall feel to the original source material (if not a bit too faithful), but was engaging enough to suck in an audience that didn't know there was a previous source.  If I were to make a comparison to other scifi franchises to give newcomers an idea of what to expect, I'd tell them it a bit like Battlestar Galactica.

The story is pretty basic, if a scifi space-opera, but then again we're talking about an adaptation from a 70's source.  The filmmakers seem aware of this and shift the focus to it's the characters, which I think was a good call.  The cast are all excellent.  While I wouldn't say there are ground-breaking performances, the acting is stellar.  The visual style of directing felt very quick and dirty, which worked for the type of story they were telling.  And the visual effects in the film really can feel like a top Hollywood film at times.  I'd compare it to Star Wars prequel quality with Battlestar style of shooting.  The sets and the costumes were amazing, both keeping true to the source material but modernizing them a bit.  This movie really does feel like a labor of love from both the crew and the cast.

The crutch of this film was the ending.  I won't spoil it like SOME people who review these things, but think of Trinity's Death from the Matrix mixed with Return of the Kings.  The film just wouldn't end.  Every side-character seemed to have a curtain call, which for fans is great, but for non-fans they are wondering why 2 minutes are wasted on saying goodbye to a guy who had like 10 lines at best.  I believe the last scenes needed to be streamed lined as there is a time restraint on solving the final conflict, but we're taking time for all these moments.  If not for that ending, I would have given this film 5 stars.

Overall I'd say this is a great scifi film.  In fact I could see it playing well in a western theater (if the ending was edited).  It can be simple at times, but I found myself wishing this was a good miniseries or tv series as I felt like I wanted more of these characters.  It's a great show, a great universe to explore, and action was fast paced and exciting.  For newcomers who like the reboot of Battlestar Galatica, you'll love this film, and for original fans... c'mon, you already own this.",1452384000,,2695,4.4048582995951415

2004750,5,B0001I551K,"For a movie based on a 40 plus year old anime with a budget of just $12 million, this is shockingly good. I don't even really know where to start. Its almost two and a half hour long runtime is fully utilized and by the end you wish it would keep going for another 2 and a half hours. I can only hope that it was enough of a success to continue the franchise with a live action sequel.

Granted, this is a B-movie budgeted movie based on a beloved, yet decidedly B-quality anime from 1975, which, while the story may still hold up, the animation surely doesn't, and yet this movie works on pretty much every level. It stays true to enough of the source material while modernizing the parts that need modernization to make it work cohesively and completed successfully. The aliens are finally alien enough to be quote unquote, alien, and the cgi is on the level of Hollywood movies of today with 10 times the budget. How they achieved this is remarkable, and worth the cost of admission. Only once did I look at the massive cgi set pieces and feel even remotely unconvinced, and that was so close to the end that I was already caught hook, line, and sinker by the story so it couldn't have mattered less. The performances are appropriately touching and cheesy, as this was one of the first true space operas ever in existence, much less to make it to American shores (being made in 1975 and brought to America in 1977, two years after Star Wars' popularity made it monetarily feasible).

It hits all the right notes, and for that I will forever be amazed. Genuinely worth your time and money if you're a fan of soft scifi or cheesy space operas. If Syfy could put this much effort and heart into its productions, they wouldn't have to make such admitted tripe just to keep from going bankrupt.

2004783,5,B0001I551K,"Wahoo.... I love this movie. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, so be forewarned. It's a live action movie created from a popular Japanese anime that first aired back when I was a kid living in Japan. (And that was over 40 years ago.) If you understand the nature of Japanese anime, the highly stylized, over the top melodrama in ""Space Battleship Yamato"" is totally understandable. But for some Western sensibilities it may just seem to be unrealistic stoicism and overacting on the part of everyone involved.

The special effects are pretty good for a 2010 release. The story-line is a bit of a mix up from a couple of seasons of the show, but it holds true to the feel of the original anime. If you saw the animated series as a kid in the United States as ""Star Blazers"", you'll probably see some of what you remember, but the version you saw was hacked up from the original pretty badly. There is a great deal of screaming and histrionics in the movie, as there are in many Japanese Sci-Fi movies. Subtlety isn't always a Japanese forte in this type of cinema. (Just watch a few of the original Godzilla movies.) But if you turn off your brain and just watch the pretty lights and go with the flow, you might find you enjoy it.

We just watched their weekly adventures as the went from place to place. Now I know the whole story, kind of... I did some reading on the original, and the movie strays a bit from it, but the arc is more or less the same. The pacing is a little weird because they had to compress the whole story into one movie, so it felt like it started off at a normal pace, at first explaining characters and establishing back stories, and then suddenly they were at their destination. Even so, most things were answered sufficiently with no gaping holes lacking explanation. The ending was quite different from the original, and unfortunately, kind of predictable, so negative points there.

I was led astray somewhat by the words ""English Dubbed"" although it's completely my own fault. I knew I'd get a dubbed version, but I assumed that the Japanese soundtrack would also be available? No. No, it's not. I really really wanted to hear it in the original language, because I hate dubbed shows... but the translations were pretty well done, not painfully awkward or hokey, so it was bearable. (You know how sometimes dubbed stuff is almost unwatchable? Or unlisten-to-able, as it were? Well, this wasn't one of them.)

I worried about the crew and wondered how on Earth they would achieve their mission. I recently rewatched the original series, and, well, it was obviously made for children. Every episode had a happy ending, perfect for the Disney generation. Frankly, the series didn't do my memories justice.

This movie, however, brought it all back. I literally had chills at seven or eight different points in the movie and found myself again wondering how they were going to make it. For two hours, I was transported to a place I hadn't been in 30+ years.

This movie isn't perfect. Some events are a bit too coincidental, and there's a lot more dialogue than in the series. The special effects are good, but not really better than any other Hollywood movies produced in the last ten years. It's because of these ""problems"" that some reviewers give it a terrible review. I would argue, though, that none of that matters.

If you judge a film only on its CGI and action scenes, you'll be mildly disappointed. This film isn't made for you. If you judge a movie by how it makes you feel, how it gives you a feeling that you didn't realize you had forgotten, you'll love it. Everything good from your childhood is in this movie.

2004926,3,B0001I551K,"I never followed the anime series ""Space Battleship Yamato."" This live-action movie was my first (and so far only) experience with the franchise.

It was fun, refreshingly different from many recent US sci-fi offerings of a similar nature, and much more emotionally compelling than I would have expected. It reminded me a lot of the re-imagined ""Battlestar Galactica."" All in all, I'm glad I watched it.

My only real reservation was the disturbing reference to the real-life WWII Japanese battleship Yamato. I understand the cultural significance of the name in Japan and the series premise that the Space Battleship Yamato was a revival of the WWII Japanese battleship. I also know the basic history of the WWII Japanese battleship Yamato and why it is considered of such great importance and significance. The mission to defend Japan against foreign aggressors undertaken by the spaceship echoes the mission of the naval vessel.

All well and good, except that the WWII Japanese battleship Yamato was part of, really a symbol of, Imperial Japan's brutal war machine. This is the same Imperial Japanese war machine that committed atrocities and crimes against humanity in China and Korea and horrific war crimes against Allied POWs, including Americans.

Glorifying Imperial Japan this way is like glorifying Nazi Germany. There would be howls of protest (I presume) if the Germans were to create a series ""Space Battleship Bismarck."" Or, maybe not.

2004928,5,B0001I551K,"If you're a fan of the original anime series Space Battleship Yamato or the US two season release Starblazers, you'll likely be a fan of this DVD.

The movie is rather faithful to the TV series in a lot of ways - most critically the Yamato (or Argo if you watched the US version) comes to life in solidly done CGI. Yes, the plot is changed for budgetary reasons (this movie was done for an amazingly low budget) and some characters roles have changed (very very mild spoiler...)

...Nova is a pilot instead of head of ops...

Elements from both Season I and Season II are woven together in the movie. Without giving things away, some scenes are done shot for shot, line for line, right from the original series. One in particular, is done magnificently. If you are expecting a change story and the high drama space opera story of the original anime series gone, you'll likely be disappointed. If you're not familiar with both the Starblazer and Space Battleship Yamato mythos, and all you know is Starblazers, you may find the Japanese nationalism theme a bit jarring.

Transfer quality of both the DVD and Bluray is high quality.

The English voice over changes the story slightly from the Japanese original with subtitles. I would recommend watching both ways.

A live action version of the legendary ""Star Blazers"" anime televsion show, ""Space Battleship Yamato"" is a fairly faithful adapation of the original animated series that hits all the right notes while staying true to the orginial story [Hollywood, please take note.
Set in 2199, Humanity is on the losing side of an interstellar war with the Gamilas, who want to terraform Earth into a radioactive wasteland that would be ideal for their needs.
Once a hotshot space ace, Susmuu Kodai now ekes out an existance salvaging metals on the radioactive surface.  An encounter with a message probe from the planet of Iskandar gives humanity new hope, because not only does it contain details for a warp drive and powerful defense weapon, it hints that the people of Iskandar have a device that can restore the Earth.
Captain Okita leads a crew of voluneers; including Koda who blames him for his brother's death, on a journey to Iskandar - which is 148,000 light years away in the Large Magenllic Cloud Galaxy.
At the heart of ""Space Battleship Yamato"" are the powerful themes of love, redemption, and self-sacrifice.
Very powerful and extremely faithful to the original anime series.

It was tweaked so that we could actually get the story on every level.  With this movie, all they did was translate it into English, they didn't spend the time and effort to tweak it for US audiences and it falls flat a lot.  Know all the characters in the original?  Well you are going to spend half of the movie trying to figure out who is who because in this one all of the names are the original Japanese names and not Derek Wildstar, Nova, etc.  If you can watch it for free somewhere, I would suggest that.

2004948,3,B0001I551K,"As someone that enjoys Star Trek, Terminator, Firefly and RoboTech, I found this movie worth the rent.  I am unsophisticated, so I needed the English dubbed version.  I am not very liberal although my next comment might imply that I am.  I had to get over the fact the Japan was basically the fleet to protect earth.  Even a Japanese was in command of the UN space fleet and spoke in Japanese during press conferences.  Really?  Typically the UN speaks in English as the international language.  If we are to believe that Japan ends up ruling the UN and not China (I can accept that the US role will diminish as China grows) in the future that is a little far fetched.  Even in this years Godzilla, the plot was Japanese-centric when the action was taking place in Japan and only moved to US when Godzilla headed that way.  I think if an international cast (Yamato was only full of Japanese) would have made the movie a little more believable (like a space ship shaped like a battleship is believable!!).

Graphics great and the movie seems to depict space battles well (except sound, of course).

Oh, (SLIGHT SPOILER) there is point where an inspirational speech is needed.  The captain harkens the memory of the Battleship Yamato in 1945.  Really?  That is used a inspiration?  The total waste of lives in the turkey shoot that was Yamato in 1945 cannot be an inspiration.  In a 100 years is Japan STILL not teaching about the tragedy of WWII and the incredible loss of life for no reason other than honor?

The best movies today include diverse characters.  The last Transformers involved action in China with important Chinese characters.  I think I naively expected the same from a moved entitle SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO.  I know, reading that now you have to ask yourself, ""what did this reviewer expect?""",1415318400,,1810,4.685714285714286

I have only seen the Americanized ""Star Blazers', so some things were a bit different. But if you come in with an open mind and realize it isn't 'Star Blazers' than its a great romp.

The only grip I have is the fact the English dub does not always match the Subtitles.  The 5.1 audio is available in both the original language (Japanese?) and voiced over in English.  Sound quality is great, but I prefer the actual actors voice quality (pitch and tone) over the people they had to the English voiceover.  The dub issue is more than likely due to the interpretation of the original scrip as spoken by the Japanese actors vs. the ""Americanization of the dialog for the USA.

2005073,3,B0001I551K,"The movie is pretty well made, acting is a little suspect but I think it is more of a cultural difference than bad acting.  Also, the voice over definitely hurts the action/acting.  The story line is a little hard to follow, a lot of details are left out and for someone to go from a former garbage collector/scavenger to starfighter leader to captain of the ship in four days is a little unbelievable.  I realize they are assuming you have most of the character background established in the tv series but without that it is a little preposterous.

I don't fully understand the ending of the movie as to how they actually saved the earth when they met with that other alien and then destroyed the last big ship.  I missed some connection there.  Also, when they evacuated that massive ship in the end and there were only 12 people who had to get off??? Again, not realistic in the slightest way.

All that being said, visually, it was a decent movie and could almost be a comedy if you dubbed it a different way.  I am a huge scifi fan so that helps in my liking the movie but I don't think I will be watching this one again.",1406160000,2,1126,4.328571428571428

The male and female lead decide this is the perfect time to reminisce about their younger days, how will I live without you, you mean so much to me, your legacy inspires to be a better person, etc.

2005126,5,B0001I551K,"There has been an annoying trend in the past decade or so of terrible movies being made from fondly-remembered TV shows of the late 70's and early 80's (Fat Albert, Speed Racer, Land of the Lost, The A-Team, etc.) In every case, no matter how much the filmmakers claim to be fans of the source material, the movies completely lose the feel of the originals, and what made them so enjoyable in the first place.

Space Battleship Yamato, on the other hand, nails it. The story is updated similarly to the reimagined Battlestar Galactica (grimmer tone, darker lighting, gender-flipped characters), but still contains many of the iconic images and moments from the first series. Events and plot elements have also been woven in from later in the franchise, specifically Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato and Final Yamato, and there are even a couple references to the US version, Star Blazers. The Gamilas (and the Iscandarians) have been completely reimagined, but are still very effective. The visuals are very well-done  the shot of Yamato rising up out of the dried seabed is GLORIOUS  and the script capably condenses the original 12 hours of story down to 2.

And to give old-time fans an extra thrill, the three characters who have dialogue only in voice-over  Dessler, Starsha, and the robot Analyzer  are played by the original actors.

All in all, this film unquestionably  deserves a place in the collection of any Yamato or Star Blazers fan.",1403568000,,1451,4.918032786885246

I could not believe such incredible special effects could be done for about 7% of typical US blockbusters, such as the new ""Star Trek"" films.  I am certainly glad I did, as ""Space Battleship Yamato,"" clocking in at 132, is MUCH better paced than any of the ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars"" films, including my favorite, ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  This is especially remarkable, in that most of the characters are really not all that memorable and the film is entirely in Japanese, with English subtitles.  The Japanese are excellent at copying and improving upon Western product.  While they have largely done so here, I could have done without the hokey ending, partially a steal from ""Return of the Jedi"".

How the robot factored into it all. Nova as the Black Tigers Ace. The Marines being in place for the Gamilon war. All good.

Cons; It gets really dark. then darker than that. The final ressolution between Gamilon and Iskandar felt like it was something leftover from another movie. It didn't work. The end was almost perfect only marred by our final introduction to what should have been the main villain all along, Desslock. Yeah it came close to a ""Galactus is a big cloud"" moment.

The movie does take some artistic license and most of it I was fine with. There was, however, one character radically changed in a way that I felt worked better in the cartoon series.

So it's a toss-up. One can always adjust the TV.

The English dub is ""nominal"" for anyone who really, really hates reading subtitles, but it makes me cringe a bit. Thankfully the Giant Ape discs feature the original Japanese track (with English subtitles), which has more character. (The English dub is not ""well acted,"" but it's not terrible.)

As for the movie, both newcomers and fans of the original anime will love it. The plot, characters, and even the costumes stick very closely to the anime, yet insert minor changes that turn a youthful adventure into an adult tale worthy of the big screen. For example, there is a reason Gamilas wants Earthof all the planets that must exist between here and the Large Magellanic Cloud. (Hint: Since Gamilas was ""renovating"" Earth anyway, it was not the planet they wanted. In the anime, Gamilas was simply a humanoid empire looking to subjugate Earth.)

The men weren't much better. It centers on a macho pilot and his heroics, but he's kind of an idiot douchebag.

While there is dubbing they actually  used people who can act and not walk through the story.  I watched this with my niece who is a virulent film critic, and she found it to be surprising good as to the techinicals, effects, story and acting. I just found it to be a little long (about 2 hours) but heck it had a real storyline, good effects and well worth the watching.  It is a take on a couple of the samurai stories so people do die in this story, but it is really well done.  It is a good add to my collection.",1401840000,,686,4.044444444444444

The rest seem always to be out of sync due to the voice dubbing and they really were ""B""  type movies. This movie I really enjoyed and it seem to always be in sync. From the beginning to the end there were very good action scenes and the actors were entertaining. They seem to act effortlessly and very natural. There a few scene that brought back some "" oh, please don't"" memories, but all in all it was a good ""home"" entertainment movie. A pretty good performance.",1401667200,,547,4.310679611650485

The tension in certain scenes in completely ruined when the main character ruminates for an interminable amount of time on the mortality of man or some such when he should be doing something. It doesn't really work (for me anyway) to take a cartoony and fun premise and try to make a serious emotional movie out of it.

The only really disappointing thing to me was I felt the plot line was rushed.  Character development was way to quick and the resolution just seemed to easy.  But that's a drawback to compressing 26 (I believe) episodes into a 2 hour movie.

There are differences between the original series and the movie but it definitely is one for the library. Thanks to all the people involved in creating a live action version of this wonderful anime series I watched as a child.

The only thing is the way it was written didn't allow for the second season to be made into a movie with the crew battling the Comet Empire.

The movie had a want to be big budget feel that never quite delivered. Additionally there were too many crisis speeches, obviously meant to add to the altruism and patriotism that went too long with a Star Wars like symphonic trying to pick up where the dialogue could not deliver. I think Meisa Kuroki was also paired poorly, she has more talent than Yamato utilized.

Having said that, this was one of the best Japan sci fi movies I have seen.  I hope I can say that this is independent of the fact that one of my favorite Japan actors, Kimura Takuya, is the star of this show.  I have seen all his TV shows, dramas, and movies, some are good and some are not, and I was relieved that this movie was in the former category.  Weirdly, the instant video does not even list KimuTaku's name in the actor list.  I was never a huge fan of the Yamato series (I prefer the Galaxy Express series by the same mangaka) but still enjoyed this very much.

2005216,4,B0001I551K,"Having been a huge fan of Star Blazers from when I was a kid in the 70's, i was definitely interested in seeing this film when I first heard about it a few years ago.  While it's been available on foreign dvd and Bluray for a while (and YouTube), I wanted to wait for a proper U.S. release before watching it all the way through and passing judgment on it.

I'm at the end of my second full viewing (I've watched some of the great battle scenes a few extra times) since I bought the Bluray a few weeks ago and I liked it even more the second time around.  Ironically (for being such a purist when it comes to foreign films and subtitles) I've actually watched it both times with the English dub instead of the Japanese soundtrack with subtitles.  I did this for two reasons: 1) I wanted to focus solely on the movie as I would any American release and, 2) the English dub is actually pretty good.  Although the dialogue has been ""Americanized"" in places (compared to what the subtitles are saying) they're pretty consistent throughout and most of the voice actors actually do a commendable (and thankless) job of dubbing the dialogue in English (nothing like 1970's Godzilla movies).  I do plan on watching it properly in Japanese (with subtitles) in the future.

So, how's the movie?  Actually, it's pretty damn good.  Upon first viewing I was taken out of the moment only a few times with a corny line of dialogue here or there but the number of instances decreased perceptively this second time around as I became more familiar with this film's take on Japanese drama.  It's not dissimilar, in that sense, to some of the perceived ""over-acting"" in many of Kurosawa's films.  There is also a very strong sense of honor and self-sacrifice that runs throughout the movie (sometimes just a tad too much), but this again is very common in Japanese culture.  it remains pretty loyal to what I remember of the sanitized version of the Space Battleship Yamato anime series from the 70's (known to us in America as Star Blazers).  Also, if you can let yourself escape into the moment, it's a lot more emotional and dramatic than just about everything sci-fi that comes out of Hollywood these days.  it would be easy to write off as mere melodrama but, again, Hollywood often specializes in what I deem melodrama (a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters) which shouldn't be confused with films that have characters who possess strong emotions (like this one).  Coupled with some often fantastic CGI (though, admittedly, some is more along the lines of high-end TV-grade CGI) and some pretty decent acting, honestly, you get a better-than-average sci-fi flick with strong central themes and some wonderful action scenes, that is well-paced, has a coherent script, and gives you just the right amount of eye candy throughout to keep the action flowing without losing any of the story or interest in the human elements (yes, Mr. Lucas, it is possible to accomplish these feats in one movie).  You also get a decent Steven Tyler track written specifically for the movie (apparently).

As far as the Bluray itself goes, the visuals are fantastic (top notch transfer) and the 5.1 TrueHD English and 5.1 TrueHD Japanese tracks are excellent (though I would've liked a bit more in the low frequency department).  Incidentally, the dialogue is a bit more pronounced on the Japanese track giving the impression of an overall quieter sound on the Japanese verson versus the Engish track.  Also, both tracks were a good 7 dB-10 dB quieter than most films I watch on Bluray (not a big deal, just had to turn it up the volume more)

I vacillated between 3.5 stars and 4 stars but for the fact that the film does many more things right than it does wrong (and for the sake of Star Blazers nostalgia), I ultimately decided 4 stars out of 5 were deserved for this well-done, initial foray into higher budget Japanese sci-fi cinema.",1400803200,,3999,4.718390804597701

The only flaw in the movie for me was the extended ending -- the director should have condensed the live drama to keep the suspense, otherwise this was a great space epic. There were visible budget constraints, but very few and they can easily be forgiven as I doubt they had a big budget. The actors were likable, the special effects for the most part were on par with the recent Galactica Reboot, and the Argo... OMG, amazing!!!

But their were certain scenes I was happy to revisit in Japanese in subtitles. It was a learning experience to hear the differences in tone and performance from the Japanese and English actors reading the lines. I never grew up with the original 1970;s anime show, so I can't testify what is right or wrong with this live action translation. The only complaint I would have is they compressed the entire series into a little over 2 hour movie. So obviously some things are lost in the compression.

The ending was long and drawn out, but I vaguely understand it fits in Japanese culture. As far as the similarities to Battlestar Galactica 2003+, its not intentional  as they use the same special effect techniques. I was simply blown away this was a Toho studio production as I didn't think they were capable of producing a film with this much advanced effects.

The original show always showed both sides and the drama that ensued within each faction. Once you see the aliens, the film starts to feel empty as you only are shown the drama of the good guys. Its too one sided.
The visual effects for the ship and ship fights are impressive.
Other Japanese cinema have included Japanese actors to play aliens, such as Godzilla and Ultraman, they could have CGIed them to look more alien, instead of making them generic ps1 graphics.
Merging Yuki and the Iskandars were confusing, you don't see how they fix earth, just an abrupt ending.
It's as if, oops, we ran out of budget.
They took out the drama of dealing with the Gamilons which was the strength of the original show.

This Live action film was made in 2010 and has been online for a while bootleg as well as with the wrong subtitles. Well for those of us who respect the movie industry and endured the wait.........It was Worth it!

Classic Japanese Animae in Live Action form. The CGI is Dead on the 70's Classic Animated Series. The music we remember from the show is there as well as a Steven Tyler song Love Lives.

This Film looks like Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Star Blazers all Rolled into one!! It's CRAZY AWESOME!!!!

THIS IS A MUST HAVE CLASSIC!!!",1398816000,2,671,4.528925619834711
2005281,3,B0001I551K,"Before: I knew the term anime. The local channels ran a space epic cartoon called Star Blazers. When some of your favorite movies are Star Wars saga. And Tv favs were reruns of Star Trek(org)  and Battle Star Galatica (70s).How can you pass up a show about space travel?And What some one said this show is from the same people who makes Godzilla,that was a surprise. Fast foward in the 90's ,putting $25 down per dvd didn't matter. So when this movie came out few years ago ,Thinking it was another clipped together of the old shows. I left it alone. But watching the trailer on AMZ.I saw it wasn't(and its LIVE!),so I now have it. And I think I expected to much:
Pros:
Effects  very good,English, voice dub VG(yes this version has Eng),Yamato and her fighters look like the show. Yamato more so. Wildstar's or in this case Kodai's barrows from mechs a bit Basic story line stuck too,Not such a happy ending.
Cons:
One side story,basically just the crew(on ship)who lack personality,and ""Oh No..Were under attack"".Gamillia & Iskandar are a collective ,like STNext's Borg. With  under fed Battle Droids from new SW saga. Cap. Okita makes up story of alien device. Yuki(Nova)is a hot shot pilot,not nurse.
 To further separate from the show ,other crew members were changed a bit. The biggest is the doctor,he gets a youth and sex change. The Space Marines from Comet Empire are also thrown in.
 The story: Earth's last fleet in 2199 is battling Gamillian's over Mars. Yup that moved in a bit from the show(Jupitor,Saturn)Okita's ship escapes(same manner ).A message of aid comes  via space craft crashing on Earth(not Mars)its still discovered by Kodai. Yamato is off to outer space to save the human race. With only a couple hit and run attacks,The destruction of bridge 3 is the worse they see on the journey which is about 4 warps long. They get to Gamillia,land fight battle droids,meet the good/bad being thing. Think there finished when they see Earth,but are ambushed. Ends the way the Comet Empire would of ended if Tralanna didn't help at the end.
 This movie was a fine effort and the fact the crew gets beat bad  (again like S2),Before getting home is  a plus for making it more real. To put 26 half hr shows in a 138 mins not going to happen,but I was expecting to much,washed in memories,was not a good way to watch. If your a fan of the show. Buy it,watch it as its own thing you will enjoy it more. If you like space adventures ,this may also be worth your time.",1398816000,2,2476,4.596371882086168

While I don't remember much of the original series, this live action film did a great job in adapting the anime version to film screen. The visual fx is excellent. It has that Battlestar Galactica Reboot feel to it. Yet the costumes and ship design all felt familiar. I was especially impressed that they were able to capture a true look to the captain of the ship.

Great flick for the kids as the film is definitely an action sci-fi adventure genre. The film is dubbed in English so you don't have to read subtitles. The storyline is simple, with a rehashed character development seen in man other films, but overall I believe this film kept true to the series.

It's Yamato done as a SyFy movie of the week, basically.

The CGI work is nice, but they don't have the budget to do the giant battles the show deserves, so much of the action is moved to inside the Yamato. The result just feels cheap.",1397606400,,490,4.556818181818182
2005308,3,B0001I551K,"You see what they did to the Gamillans and the Iscandarians. (Probably Spoilers Later)

As one who didn't grow up on this, I finally caught the Yamato 2199 anime remake last year and loved it. I've since started watching it in it's original form online so I can see the story after the Iscandar arc. So when I found this on a search result on a streaming site, I immediately jumped on the chance to see the live action version.

The opening scenes roll and you are completely blown away. The space combat is fantastic. You get a Wing Commander feeling from them which is great. However, they unfortunately continue with that as the ship interior scenes don't feel like it is actually on a space ship. The acting is a mix of so-so to bad at times and when combined it feels like you are watching a movie that just didn't have a good budget. The studio tried but fails to overcome it.

But that isn't the most glaring problem with this movie. The worst problem with it is the chopped up storyline. A lot of segments are skipped entirely. Now you can forgive them because they can't cram 20+ episodes into 2hrs. But, they did something horrific which more fans should be up in arms about. That is, the complete rewrite of both the Gamillans and Iscandarians.

They turn them into energy beings. Now Desura does appear but he appears as the droid of a Gamillas fighter they capture. So, Dommel, Frakken, Melda...all the fantastic Gamillas characters which make the story even deeper and iconic, are gone. Replaced by energy beings who have no personality and are just evil for the sake of being evil.

This completely changes how the end of the movie goes about things and honestly, when they get to Gamillas and the movie turns into Starship Troopers, I finally closed out the browser window. Just could not stand what they did to such a wonderful story all to get to see some decent CGI effects.

Watch this movie for the first part and for the special effects. Those will have you giggling like a school kid with joy and are what makes this film overall worth 3 stars. But with bad acting and a gross departure from the cannon, the rest of this movie can't be redeemed. Rent this if you get a chance, otherwise, I wouldn't buy it.",1397520000,,2229,4.491358024691358

2005327,3,B0001I551K,"****Possible Spoilers Ahead****

Overlong and rather cornball space opera that takes place in the future when an alien race is turning Earth into a radioactive wasteland. The special effects are decent and there's a lot of action peppered throughout to help keep you awake. The problem is that the story is largely a by-the-numbers Star Wars retread (see update), with a few other sci-fi plots tossed in to mix it up a little. The acting ranges from wooden to scenery chewing hysteria that had me actively rooting for the bad guys in places. No clich is missed as the movie chugs along toward its predictable ending. The good news is that the end leaves no room for a sequel.

I can see this being enjoyed best by those under the age of twenty-five who haven't been exposed to a lot of these types of films, and who can tolerate one tear-jerking coda after another as the film heads into its final act.

Update 2/17/14: Turns out this movie's original storyline, done as a series in 1974,  pre-dates Star Wars, as was noted in the comments on my review. So I have upgraded my review to 3 1/2 stars for the originality factor.

It should be noted, that there will be no English dubbed version. All releases in DVD and BluRay will be in Japanese with English subtitles.  This is due to the contract with actor/singer Takuya Kimura (who plays Kodai).  No big deal.  This is how the film should be viewed.

You can tell this film was made by fans for fans.  Although there were some changes, respect was shown to the original material, unlike some reboots/remakes/retellings.

If you want to learn more about this film, and the anime series, check out the website ""ourstarblazers.com""

UPDATE: since the previous review was written on the film, here is one for the DVD/BluRay: Audio is clear and crisp, picture quality is excellent.  The majority of the extras (as in most cases) are on the BluRay disk. There isn't a lot of extras, but at least the film's trailers are there. And yes, there is an English dub.  I am curious what Eleven Arts and Giant Ape did to have been allowed to produce a dubbed version (ref: Takuya Kimura's contract) compared to the previous foreign releases of this film.  After listening to the English dub (it's a hit and miss with the voice actors chosen), I still prefer hearing it in Japanese.

Sheesh, if Optimus Prime can come back, so can Kodai and the Yamato.

2005346,3,B0001I551K,"I just finished watching the Japanese live action, Space Battleship Yamato. (In America, people my age would call it Star Blazers).  I want to give props to all of those who put this movie together for a reported $12 million. Some TV shows cost that much to do 6 episodes. And while I believe they got the most out of every dollar, the story telling is too fast in some areas and sappily stretched in others.

I think the hardest part to take was how convenient most battle scenes ended in favor of the heroes. Through several battle sequences, you never really feel like the crew of the Yamato is in any real danger as the fighting tactics of the enemy seem inept for a society that has mastered interstellar travel and had no real problems setting our planet on its ass. On Iskandar, heroes do die in a big way, (I won't say who). But I still can't help but feel like the Gamilons would have flunked out of West Point. Speaking of Gamilons, the enemy's appearance has been greatly altered.  I can only imagine that it was cheaper to computer generate the Gamilons rather than pay anymore actors.  As for the acting, I will not label it good or bad. I will call it anime, which is a compliment.

For fans of the show, the material is handled with respect and, all-in-all, the movie is a fun ride. It definitely helps if you were a fan of the show. But you will have to let some things go to enjoy this movie, which I was will to do.

If Hollywood takes up the cause, I recommend two movies. One going to Iskandar and the other going home. Maybe J.J. Abrams can help us better understand why the villains are doing what they are doing to Earth and not, say... Mars.  Tell us why the trip to Iskandar is so important. I mean, why couldn't our helper on Iskandar send this device of salvation directly to Earth instead of putting us on this long and dangerous trip. Someone from Iskandar did send us a free sample, so why not the whole kit?  They kind of try to explain it, but it lacks full gravity. As a big screen adventure, I see this story's potential. This version is worth watching.  But a better telling can certainly be done. (Keep the person who did the soundtrack. the music is nicely done as were the English subtitles).

Given that they made the most of a very small budget, and the reverence with which a nice chunk of the original story was preserved, I give the movie a B-.",1382054400,,2387,4.331838565022421

This movie is often touted as being on the effects level of ""Battlestar Galactica"" but I would equate it more on the level of the first season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" or ""Babylon 5"".  The effects shots are so short, so badly paced, and frankly skipped over in spots (due to budget constraints I can only imagine) that some plot points happen off camera and nonsensical things happen.  The pacing also slows down at dramatic spots that you actually start wondering what is going on everywhere else (slow pacing during an ""emergency"" makes no sense).  Overall there is much more believe-ability in most US television shows that in this movie. Storyline changes pull too much from other unrelated movies and not in a good way. The original story and plot points were so much better. This movie really frustrated me in that all the effort was put in to make it and it turned out so badly.
The one thing I really enjoyed is how some of the original score was woven in. That was really good.

What they have done is impressive to say the least.  It does a much better job than the original Space Battleship Yamato movie.  The original movie was a 2 hour ""highlight"" reel complete with a bad voice over which said things like ""Yamato went to Jupiter and fought.....Then went to Pluto and fought....Then went to....."".  Very poor indeed and actually almost unwatchable.

This new feature doesn't try any of that.  What we are left with is a tighter story line with a lot more continuity with enough plot devices from the first series to be familiar.  I won't spoil it but suffice it to be say, you will easily recognize certain aspects from the first season.

What I found even better was how it incorporated some threads from ""Arrivederci Yamato"" as well.  Again, I won't spoil it, but you will see some definite paralells between certain plot devices and that story as well.

Overall I really enjoyed it. It is a nice adaptation and the acting is better than I expected.  The production values are also better than I thought.

The United States has the USS Enterprise, another odd spaceship with a flying saucer, two rockets, and a satellite dish cobbled together to form an immediately recognizable American icon.  Finally, the UK with the Doctor and his absurd blue police box.  Each ship tugs on deep nationalist feelings in each country.  They also have something else in common: the ships are not just machines, but characters in their own right.
The live action Yamato was as fulfilling to me and successfully sentimental in its Japanese way just as the new Star Trek films capture the zeitgeist of 21st Century United States, or the TARDIS and its British nostalgia.  The new Yamato reminded me a great deal of the BSG reboot, as well.
The Yamato live action film is my favorite Japanese sci-fi film of all time.",1370390400,,1232,4.856459330143541
2005374,2,B0001I551K,"I bought this move as a gift for my brother. We all loved Star Blazers back in the late 70's and early 80's. Every episode left you hanging and wanting more. I was excited to see that Japan had filmed a live action version of this legendary animation series. When we finally got around to watching it....we were all really disappointed in this effort.

I think what we were hoping for was that this film was the beginning of a new series. Instead we watched a film that looked like it was created for television (like Red Dwarf) audiences. There were some moments of the old magic...the Yamato looks great, the music soundtrack is right on, some of the actors look the part. But overall it is a mediocre attempt at bringing this series to the big screen. One big disappointment was the way the Gamalons were represented. I wish they had stuck to the style of the animation series. The Gamalons leader Desslock was a powerful figure in the series....here in this movie he barely makes an appearance. Also the Gamalons don't even look like the aliens in the series. They look like an entirely different species from the 70's animated series. Their ships also don't have the same designs that the animated version portrays. Bottom line is that the movie is overall disappointing.

I have heard that an American film company is interested in a live action version of this series. Maybe the Hollywood treatment will succeed over this Japanese version. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake of the entire (I saw that Yamato 2199 is currently being developed) animated series done Japanese style with today's technology. It would and could be awesome. While America has Star Trek and Star Wars....Japan always had Star Blazers....I feel the best is yet to come for this often neglected and bypassed series.",1370217600,6,1793,4.762057877813505

2005376,5,B0001I551K,"1977 animation film Battle Spaceship Yamato(Star Cruisers) is the short-edited version of 1974 TV series(26 episodes) of the same title which was made into English-dub animation series Star Blazers in 1979. US release edited out WW2 account of Battleship Yamato but otherwise the storyline is almost the same as Japanese theatrical version. As Star Blazer series turned out some of the character names have been anglicized and human-type robot Analyzer was introduced as IQ-9.

During mid 70s pollutions, natural disasters, the fear of the nuke wars was so intense around the world, the films with apocalyptic themes such as ""Japan Sinks"" or ""Prophesy of Nostradamus"" became huge success in Japan. The film starts with lifeless dried-up surface of the earth in AD 2199 as the result of alien attacks by Gamillons from their Pluto outpost. Human beings survived underground but it has only one year before the radiation wipes out all human existence. It is the message from Iscandar 148,000-light-year away from Earth which is the last hope. Given the Wave Motion Engine plans attached in the message from Iscandar. Former WW2 flagship Yamato was reformed into Space Cruiser and with a number of extraterrestrial techs built into the ship Yamato(Argo) set out to the intergallactic journey.

The film's success paved the way for sci-fi animation series such as Gundam series or Neon Genesis Evangelion and Miyazaki fantazy films.

While it is similar to Star Wars, Yamato is not entirely militaristic as you see in conversation between Jason(Derek) and Yuki(Nova) when they saw the ruins of what used to be the Gamillas civilization. Leiji Matsumoto who took part in character designs and key role in production hate being interpreted as glorifying wars. The series was ahead of time and used mostly existing heavenly bodies and used latest astronomical discoveries(it was planned before Pioneer and Voyager uncovered the truth about Jupiter and Saturns.) The series also materialized what lie beyond Pluto in solar system(helioscope). Despite its gloomy tones I enjoyed both the TV series and the film version because it expands our mind beyond Solar System and future space exploration light years away when mankind could only dispatch unmanned space plobes out to Jupiter and Saturns.

Verdict: Outstanding sci-fi drama ahead of time. Good for Yamato(Star Blazers) starters.

I was a huge fan of Star Blazers when I was a kid.  After the treatment of Transformers and the decline of Spiderman, I was uneasy about this film. I'm happy to have been proven wrong.  The effects are top notch.  There's only the slightest bit of shaky-cam, just on the top edge of my own personal limit.  I could have done without Analyzer, but he's disposed of quite neatly.  The film has threads of sacrifice and honor that make me want to beat my chest an shout, ""GOD BLESS AMER.... uhhhh.... BANZ.... ummmm... GO STARBLAZERS!!!!!""  One of the pilots sacrifices himself and, as his ship is crashing, he salutes and holds the salute until his ship explodes.  Brings tears to this old soldier's eyes. It gets a bit hokey, but that's par for the course in many Japanese films.  That part doesn't last long and is nicely bracketed by KA-PEW KA-PEWKA-PEW laser fights.  The real-life characters mirror the animated ones nicely.  Meisa Kuroki is ROCKIN'!!!  If you're a fan of Starblazers, this film does it no harm at all.",1368748800,,1031,4.640883977900552

2005385,5,B0001I551K,"When I was growing up I remember getting home from school on Wednesdays to watch Battle of the Planets and Star Blazers.  I have always loved Star Blazers and when I saw the trailers for a live action version...well I was very excited.  Of course it didn't release in the US and this version is in Japanese with English sub-titles.  For most Anime fans that isn't an issue.  I, however, am not a huge fan of that.  I remember the US voices to Star Blazers.  Still, this looked amazing.

A couple of important notes...this isn't the same story as the TV show...it is different. Better in many ways, more adult, deeper characters and motivations, but its also only 2 hours and you lose significant detail.  This version of the story is more Japanese than the original and is darker.  It makes the entire journey from beginning to end much more of an emotional roller coaster and the payoff is significantly better.

The SFX are wonderful and realistic.  I wish that this was a 24 episode show so that I could see so much more of the space battles.  Derek Wildstar has always been one of my favorite characters from SciFi and Kodai in this version lives up to my expectations.  He is both brooding and bravado, both anger and control, and Kimura does a wonderful job of pulling it off.  At times you dislike him and want him to grow up, and when he does you begin to realize why Capitan Okita wanted him on this mission.  Capitan Okita is perhaps my one disappointment in the film.  Capitan Avatar is a great character, he guides Wildstar and mentors him.  Okita doesn't have that chance in his short amount of screen time and comes off as gruff and distant most of the time.  Making Nova into a woman and Black Tiger pilot (Yuji Mori) goes squarely in the pattern of the new BSG.  In a way she is a more powerful character, but Kodai still has the opportunity to shine.  The casting of Dr Sado as a woman was brilliant and she really captures his humor that lightens up the darkness.

If you remember the original, then this really is a must see.  If you never saw Star Blazers, then this is a good solid Sci-Fi flick with great SFX and deep characters who fight ultimate evil with little hope to win, and who doesn't love that story?",1362700800,,2232,4.4324324324324325

unfortunately Space BattleShip Yamato is another opportunity to make an epic movie wasted.

Gamalons are omnipotent until the script doesn't want it, humanity is outclassed in every way until the script doesn't want it, broken tone, no credibility, a very slow pace with huge drawn out monologues doesn't help.

to be clear their is a lot to like in this movie, bridge set design is great, the wave motion gun was every bit as epic as I remembered it, I liked that the story worked hard at acknowledging the enormity of the task, music is great but then it's all let down by a monumentally slow pace, the apparent reality that the entire Gamalon fleet can be taken out by a smattering of black tiger fighters.... really?... should have sent those sooner.  the Yamato's guns are the only guns that actually work?.... should have equipped those on the warships they sent to Mars, the Analyzer robot can take out 1000's of gamalons at a time, should have made 2 or 3, why are the Gamalons allergic to firing on Yamato, why would Gamalons only have 1 stealth warship, why, why, why, why.... bother?

what could have been better isn't... it's not horrible but it's not good either and while it might sort of almost be worth the time to watch it's definitely not worth paying money for.

here's an idea gift wrapped 40 years ago by the series for the movie, use the onboard manufacturing they mentioned in the series to replenish lost fighters and for fixing damage so they can lose some, so Yamato can take some, then mention that a considerable number of crew are being held in stasis to be woken as required, then require it.",1361404800,5,1765,4.623003194888179

The Yamato was the flagship of the Japanese fleet in ww2. It also was sunk by the Americans in an epic battle. So in this movie the sunken ship is rebuilt into a space ship with a giant wave motion gun installed in the front. It seems like something kids would make up while playing on a dirt mound in their back yard. In fact after watching the animation series my friends and I all glued jet engines on our battle ship models and flew them around the yard. We use to do this thing call play, where we would do what ever we felt like until we got tired and went in to eat bowls of cereal. We usually felt like running in random patterns around the back yard or pushing little cars around while laying on the ground making motor noises with our mouths.

oh yea, the movie ... I really don't care if you like it or not it was cool to see the ship for me... but there was too much dialog and not enough space battles ...",1360886400,,1082,4.07981220657277

2005400,4,B0001I551K,"In the late 70s and early 80s back when it was still called Japanimation ,  Star Blazers, and the spaceship Yamato variations were my introduction to what we now call anami. For the time this was very sophisticated animation. The artwork was superior to anything American cartoonist were doing and it had a depth to the plot that unseen in any Saturday afternoon cartoons. In short I was hooked.  I never got to see any of the series beginning to end. Then when DVDs first became available the only copy of spaceship Yamato I could get would not play on my DVD player. I was a little anxious when I ordered this DVD.

Among the surprises, I had not expected this to be a live action movie. If I had read carefully and realized this was actors and not animation my  prejudices against live-action Japanese science fiction might have change my decision to purchase. At every level this was a pleasant surprise.

The plot summary for Spaceship Battleship Yamato generally follows that of the original animation series. For the rest of you; an alien race has appeared in the space above Earth and is bombarding Earth with meteorite  bombs. The effect of this bombardment is that the surface of the earth has become a barren and poisonous. The dwindling Earth population has moved underground and is fighting a losing battle against the invaders. As the movie opens one of the few remaining space fleets available to earth defense is being systematically destroyed with only the admiral's flagship barely surviving.
Saito, brother to the commander of the recently sacrificed escorts, and former and future commander of an elite space fighter squadron unit discovers an alien artifact that provides Earth command specifications for engineering and weaponry beyond current Earth capabilities. What is more he survives radiation exposure that should have been immediately deadly. Earth command adds the alien engineering to its last and most powerful space battleship, the Yamato and gambles on the significance of Saito's survival. The new battleship is launched against the aliens and proceeds on a last-ditch, all in the name of hope trans-galactic adventure to save the otherwise defenseless Earth.

As a longtime fan of science fiction I could not help but be charmed by several small but intelligent decisions made by the writers. One of the great hobbies of fan boys is to demolish the pseudo-physics that explains the various engineering feats necessary for space travel and space weapons. In this movie the answer to: what is it mean to go into ""warp""? Is ""I don't know, I think we are going to jump across a bunch of space"" - good luck poking holes in that argument. Asked about the details on the new wave gun technology the technical answer is ""I don't know it's alien"". Eventually there will be elaborate mostly nonsensical explanations but there was something very right about these answers.

On the cultural side there were a number of small things in the script that I think were meant for the Japanese audience. Shortly after losing their original ship's captain Yamato indicates that it is returning with 36 on board- 36 as in the 36 Ronin, a classic Japanese samurai story. The chief engineer of the Yamato is Tokugawa the name of a very powerful clan in Japan and the traditional founder of the first shogunate or United Japanese dynasty. I will leave it to others to point out some of the other names and references that would have been instantly identifiable by the Japanese viewers.

I would suggest that this movie compares very favorably to the original Battle Star Galactica. Or as I continue to think of that program Rattletrap Galactica. In Yamato the alien race, the Gamilas (maybe a reference to the Japanese monster movie Gamera?) could out fly, shoot or think the tin can Cylons. Capt. Okita would have no problem staring down Capt. Adama and has more leadership ability than Capt. Kirk. As for Star Wars fans , if a spaceship chase inside of a deathstar is cool, how about a squadron level dog fight Underground?!

2005411,5,B0001I551K,"The very premise of this movie, and indeed the Iscander story, is so rooted in the history of WWII Japan and the 1945 Battleship of the same name that it is hard not to be moved by it. In 1945, as the US was approaching Okinawa, the Yamato was all that was left of the Japanese Imperial Navy. Setting forth on one final mission to beach itself on the far side of Okinawa and fire it's huge Canons across the island at the US fleet,out of range of return canon fire, but not out of range from carrier-based aircraft, it's junior officers were essentially embarking on a Naval Kamikaze mission.

Space Battleship Yamato parallels much of this. Nagasaki and Horishima are seen in the way the Planet Bombs are decimating Earth. The last Battleship of the Earth Defense Force bears the same name and is built from the ruins of that very ship. Setting out a Junior crew on what many thought was likely a suicide mission.

What makes this important for Japan, is that this time it worked. Yamato out-fought all it's foes to save Earth.

To understand the impact in the 1970's when many of the Japanese still remembered what their valiant soldiers did to try and save them, is to understand how Space Battleship Yamato aspires to continue the life of the largest and arguably greatest Battleship ever built, and give them the victory this time around that they never had back then.

In many ways, I wish the telling of this story had been spread out a little more across 2 or 3 movies. But for those who appreciate the cultural impact of the original story, and even those who were excited as children to see the flying battleship in space, this is an impressive movie. I love the passion the Japanese have in movies. Over the top and blush worthy at times, I actually enjoy watching it. And the special effectswere fantastic. Combined with the authenticity of the musical score, I felt goosebumps on my goosebumps at times.

2005413,4,B0001I551K,"Space Battleship Yamato is a live-action based on the well known classic anime. This movie suffers from the highly compressed storyline rate (26 episodes reduced to a 2 hours movie) and a extremely grim atmosphere at times. Overall, I don't regret buying this movie, but I got it for $12 on Amazon. However, if you really want to enjoy it, it helps if you lower your expectation from the anime that inspired it.

The visual effects on this movie are amazing, and for the first time, you can see the Space Battleship Yamato come alive. The fighters on combat scenes are also a sight to beholds.

Some characters were modified; having more women serving on the Yamato this time around. Yuki is depicted as an Ace pilot instead of a nurse and Dr Sato as a female doctor. Analyzer starts out as a pda like device, but literally jumps out as a battle robot at a crucial point of the movie. Finally, the Gamilas are now depicted as energy beings who belongs to a Borg-like society.

The movie starts out with a grim atmosphere, portraying a defeated humanity. However, it doesn't lighten up a bit even as the mission progresses against all odds. This is in contrast with the anime series, where comic relief balanced the seriousness of their mission.

Overall, I like this film despite its few pitfalls, or maybe because of them. If you hold your knowledge about the anime, you may find a very entertaining sci-fi film.",1350604800,,1413,4.64

The movie moves along quite quickly and glosses over points that a new viewer might miss if not already familiar with the story and characters. However the overriding theme of hope, duty and self sacrifice had me misting up several times throughout the movie.
The producers failed to give me one long beauty shot of the Yamato flying in space.
My standard DVD gave me a clear picture and the subtitles were easily readable. My video hung up in the last five minutes and I had to restart the player to watch the ending smoothly.

When time (or the movie) justifys watching it with subtitles, great, I can be an elitist and say I enjoyed the film in the original language.  But, back to the point: Amazon needs to get serious and make sure the available languges are stated in the Product Description.  It strikes me that this important piece of information was 'forgotten' so Amazon could sell a few additional DVDs.  Space Battleship Yamato is a good film, but hardly a classic, one-of-a-kind film that HAS to be viewed only in the original language. OK, you got me and I bought a copy thinking an English language option was available ... but, hey, Amazon management lost my respect.  Now that I got that off my chest ...

2005428,4,B0001I551K,"I have seen the original Starblazers as a child in the 1980's along with a dozen or more animes; Thundercats, Voltron, Macross... to name just a few. I really did not have much invested or expectations that this be identical to the anime as it was live action which are often much different than the animated originals like Transformers (which was destroyed by Michael Bay). However, I am not a hardcore Starblazers fan either. They could have done better with the actors and there were many cheesy moments in the movie that could have been left out. The action scenes were great though especially towards the end. There was enough character development so you actually understood where the characters were coming from and going to towards the end of the movie.

Space Battleship Yamato really can't exactly be compared to the Battlestar Galactica series because Battlestar is mediocre at best and the camera is too jerky in Battlestar. There is only one scene I can think of that is at all similar to Battlestar Galactica but I will not explain it as it would spoil it for anyone who has not seen this movie. The special effects in Space Battleship Yamato were much better than Battlestar Galactica and it actually had a decent plot and characters you actually cared about not the ultra lame everyone might be a Cylon crap from Battlestar. I am not sure how there are legal copies since Space Battleship Yamato was never (to my knowledge) legally released outside of Japan so it would be a Chinese knock off copy. Overall I would highly recommend this movie as a must see for anime fans.

If you want to be able to say that you saw the greatest space movie ever, then you MUST see Star Blazers. Now, it is not dubbed and has US subtitles, so if you're going to complain about that, watch the movie with and then without the subtitles.

2005430,4,B0001I551K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I grew up watching ""Star Blazers"" every morning before school. Each and every episode was a sequence of events spanning dozens of episodes telling the tales of the Star Force and their journey to the planet of Iscandar. This film captured so many memorable moments and created some new ones. It is approx 2 hrs and 20 mins so obviously they couldn't fit everything in. Abbreviated or not it was amazing to finally see the Yamato (Argo) in a realistic environment. I am very pleased with this purchase. The film is in Japanese with choice of English subtittles. It may seem a little silly to some, but to true fans of the old series and the original Japanese Yammatoes, it will remind you how fun and exciting the show was. I hope that if the US gets the rights to ""Star Blazers"" we can do just as great a film as this. Audio and video qualities are superb. This may not be the official release of the film on DVD but it is the most reasonable for an import I was able to find.

If you have any affinity for the original, you will definitely want to see this!.  I still can't believe how great they made everything look.  Aside from a 'Rule 63' Doctor and transformation of IQ-9, the Yamato crew character design is perfect.  The music is just bigger, fuller versions of the original anime soundtrack.  The Gamelons no longer just look like blue people, but I think that they've done pretty well there too.  The Yamato and the Black Tiger ships are ripped straight from my memories.
Some changes to the plot from the original film, and the ending is a little too drawn out for my tastes, but after all of the awesomeness, I still had to give it five stars.  If you're a fan, you were probably just looking for confirmation that it hasn't bastardized your treasured memories...and I can assure you without any doubts in my mind, that it has not.  You can purchase without worry.

BTW, The Steven Tyler song only plays over the closing credits, and is not in any other part of the movie.",1339545600,,1207,4.5
2005433,2,B0001I551K,"Going into SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO I knew there was no way they would have the time to compact such a dense and detailed mythology into one movie - as to why it was limited to one film and not a trilogy?, I have no idea.  Given the popularity of the series not only in its home country, but around the world, it would seem like a smart idea to keep people hooked for three films instead of packing it into one; but this one was under the wave motion gun from the start to try and cobble together enough of a plot of justify making the film.  I wish I could say that they managed to do it, but, as it stands, this version of the YAMATO is whole different version all together.  The choices made to compact the story line are baffling and the changes made are confusing - you do see the ghost of the original, but only in the corners, along the margins and tucked into the shadows.

The film suffers from not being able to get over itself.  This is one emotional boat full of people who seem more interested in their personal honor and minor problems than looking at the whole picture - yes, everyone speaks with lofty voices about their mission to save the Earth, but in the end it's all about people saluting each other every time they walk into a room (seriously, every time someone saltues, take a drink and have 911 on standby to rush you to the hospital) and then apologize for some event that happened in the past and then go gung-ho on some random event that seems totally disconnected from the rest of the film.  The original series was a saga, a soap opera, but they had years to get through this material - here, you've got only over two hours and it happens so fast...until it happens so slow.  This is a film of fits.  One moment seventeen stories are going and then you get a long scene of nothing but one guy thinking to himself, staring slightly left to the camera and not sharing his thoughts.  The ending on the bridge as the final (last, totally, this it it, it's all over, people; watch me make the bold choice of going down with ship, it's really over, wait for it) sacrifice is about to be made - it goes on for forver, I feared it would never stop.  By the time the YAMATO finally is destroyed (taking the enemy down with it), I felt like a long stay in a boring room had finally come to an end.

And this is another point - count the sets.  The Yamato is a big ship with a lot of room to move about, but the film limits us to a mere handful of rooms and most of those rooms you'll see are the main bridge (which, again, point of fact to the original series - you do see a lot of the bridge); which lacks any of the depth and interest of the original series.  It's grey, dull and the Captain's chair doesn't even go up and down (I waited the whole film for that, didn't happen).

The Yamato itself is a high point in the film.  All the space shots, battles and the CGI work does, for any fan, send a true thrill through you.  It's beautiful, but so little time is spent with the ship, too few space battles and even less wave motion gun.  If you were to edit just the external scenes of the Yamato together it wouldn't run five minutes and that's plain wrong - the Yamato stands at the center of the story, here it's just something to be sacrificed at the end and you end up not caring.  It's one of the best ships in science fiction, even STAR TREK knows that people come just as much for the ENTERPRISE as the crew - here, not so much.

A point on the music - as much as I love the original theme, it's used too much here to both over score and underscore the tension and mood.  It's played loud and brave in one moment then low and slow in the next (at points it borders on a dirge); there seems to have been little effort made to expand the score and what additions they have never rise high enough for you to even know it's there.  Whoever thought to get Steven Tyler from AREOSMITH to pen and sing the closing theme - put them in front of the wave motion gun and fire!, and then hit the ashes with the wave motion gun again, just to be sure.

Overall, SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO takes too few chances and takes away far too much from the original for it to make any kind of connection.  It's too long, too unfocused and at its very worst feels just like an overhyped, pointless Hollywood production about battleships - we got that, don't need another.",1338681600,3,4375,4.182142857142857

I wonder what it would be like this film was voiced over in english? Sometimes subtitles can get in the way of enjoying the movie and really getting into the story. But those aside, it's a solid, if not a little bit predictable story.",1338508800,,516,4.26530612244898

There's a workable climax but it's kinda just filled with death and sacrifice and is far less interesting than the first half of the movie. They had absolutely no idea what to do with the characters after the ship launched. Just demonstrations of unearned camaraderie amongst the crew and dubious character development.

BUT this disk is a really cruddy bootleg, probably copied off of a real disk by my guess. I believe this because the 6 times it pauses 'multiple times,' for a second or so each, then a long one, for 10 seconds, you miss out on the most climatic moments. To much 'restart that awesome scene' on the master copy they used.

Also anytime the action gets to much you start getting major artifacts (blurry squares) from what ever low level compression they used to rip the disk.

And don't forget the 10+ minutes of commercials in the beginning that you can't skip and aren't in English.

So don't buy this disk, wait a little while till an official copy comes out for us USA fans.

2005442,4,B0001I551K,"I admit I am a huge fan of the original anime version and had been anticipating seeing this latest adaption since I first caught wind of it in 2010 prior to the actual release. That said, I was not disappointed in the least, which says something in itself after the build up waiting for the DVD release (and disappointment of learning their would not be a US big screen release or even a US DVD release). The production value is awesome, not just in consideration of the budget, but truly amazing on all levels. The only thing I thought wasn't top-notch was the subtitled dialog. I can't speak to the actual spoken dialog which was likely more natural being the native language of the production; but the translated subtitled dialog was a bit stiff. This was definitely not enough to lower my overall estimation of the film, as it did little to disconnect me from the characters or the story, both of which I found engaging. In fact, my wife (who is not a fan of the original anime version) walked into the room a third away through my screening and commented that she was going to have to watch it later from the beginning because she found she liked the characters after watching just a few scenes. I do have a word of caution for those of you who have younger children with whom you may have shared the anime version: this is not appropriate for young children. While the overall plot somewhat follows the original storyline (skipping many points due to obvious time constraints) the tone is much darker that the original, and though the violence is not overtly graphic (no gore), there are more than a few fatalities portrayed on screen that probably put it in the PG-13 or higher range.",1331769600,,1691,4.565789473684211

The movie is all in Japanese with English subtitles.  The picture was generally clean and had proper audio sync.
The only negative things I can say about the DVD is that there were 5 points during the movie in which the image because momentarily distorted.  Not the whole picture, though.  Just a part of the screen.  Replaying this part on another player produced the same errors.
The subtitling was good except for two places.  The first is during a dialog in which ""...you're..."" was written as ""...youAEre..."".  The second was far more serious.  At the end of the movie during the big climactic moment (when no words are being spoken) this subtitle appears...""CHINESE SUBTITLES BY HALF-X""
I'm guessing this DVD release was not originally intended and was more of an afterthought (feeling more like a high quality bootleg than a real effort by the studio).
There are no special features offered.
I give this 4 stars because the movie itself is really good.  For those who are SB Yamato/Star Blazers fans, the story is essenctially the first season rammed into 2 hours.  The Gamilas (Gamalons) are depicted quite differently than in the shows.  And unlike the shows, people actually die in this movie (albeit heroicly).  The special effects were quite good as well.  The Black Tiger fighters have a different appearence as well.  Although they look like really high-tech fighters, they have additional functionality I'll leave the viewer to discover for her/himself.
The soundtrack was also good.  Much of the music is new arrangements of the classic soundtrack, with some new stuff written in as well.

the gamilon ships looked nothing like in the cartoon.  just the typical ""make the ships look evil...you know, plant-cyborg hybrids...and insect like!""

Translation was good (not like some Asian releases in the US) and syntax was correct.  After watching the first run through for the story to watch it a second time for the video was fantastic.

I checked out the trailer on youtube and was impressed with the high production value so I ordered it. I have to say I was impressed. I bought my version from the highest rated seller and I found it to be a very good quality. As for the movie, the action, acting, and special effects were very good. There are some differences from the anime of course. After all they are squeezing a 26 episode anime into a 2 hour movie. The general plot is the same. The Gamilons are portrayed differently (Not really human). I agree with one of the other reviewers that they didn't give the ship enough screen time which was disappointing since the Yamato/Argo is its own character in a way. There is no English dub of this movie. There are english subtitles for this movie which are done well. Usually Japanese to english subtitles are done as literal translations which can make for awkward and disjointed reading but not in this case. My only problem with the subtitles was that they were hard to read and take in all the action at the same time. Now that I've seen it I don't think I would watch an english version of this movie. It would take away some of the emotional impact of the good acting. If your a fan of Starblazers/Yamato I recommend this movie. If your a purist I say read the other reviews and decide for yourself.",1329696000,,1496,4.327402135231317
2005451,4,B0001I551K,"This review is for the Thin Case DVD version of the Space Battleship Yamato movie (Purchased from Amazon/Far East).
The case is thin and comes in a cardboard sleeve.
The DVD sits very tight, more than I'm comfortable with, inside the case holder.
The art on the cardboard cover is much richer in color than the art on the case.

I'm not sure if this is a defect in the DVD or is a result of a flaw in the movie itself, but there was 1 scene where color was off/separated, as though the DVD might be faulty in this section.  I have only bought this one, and have not seen duplicate complaints about the color issue in one scene so I suspect the DVD may have been damaged or some other physical problem with the product.  It could also have been my player, but it did not happen with other movies and would occur every time in this one scene in the movie.

Miscellaneous notes not related to the Star rating:
I'm new to this anime series. Having just watched the original I was excited to see there was a live action version and that it was getting decent reviews. I found the movie followed the original story closely enough for what is possible to accomplish within the confines of a live action movie.  Some parts are extremely rushed, but it was still quite enjoyable.  This should be a part of anyone's collection that is interested in the genre.",1328054400,,1349,4.376
2005452,3,B0001I551K,"As both a Yamato Fan East and West this film is a mixed bag. For its budget the Effects Are Great.
The Acting and character choices are a different matter. While Im greatful this isn't an americanized
cast full of western faces like the anime -- I do wish they had cast closer to the original.
We have seen blonde asian women aplenty would it have killed them to dye Yukis hair a nova blonde.
Also some of the gender swapping re-casts such as dr sane / sado and others added nothing and detracted for the sake of having
a more politically correct modern bridge with more females ( where Nova used to be solo )

I wish they had cast someone who looked more like Orion the engineer certainly it would be easy to find asian actors
that matched better or simply had them alter their own looks. A short elderly comedic actor would have been much better
as the doctor not some tall twenty something pretty woman. It suffers from its battlestar galactica- esque reboot feel.

Desslok dessler could have been handled better, again diverging too much. In modern sci fi we see blue skinned
aliens via makeup and effects as recent as star wars prequels and star trek 2009 -- there was no need to make dessler and starsha cg bodysnatching spectres

The bridge set was nice but too dark and should have been more massive to match the animated proportions
we all know so well and loved thru 3 television series and 5 films and telefilms

The ending was a mix of other Yamato endings ( Farewell yamato and Final yamato ) and unnecessarily downbeat
if even a minor glint of hope was left ( hello space warp )

These may be quibles but they built up and detracted. While this was far from the catastrophe that was
the american 1998 Godzilla -- or if it had been Disneys aborted version from years ago that would have
americanaized the yamato into the american ship arizona -- while nowhere near that still after its
four decade long Legend Yamato deserved a bit more for its long awaited live action version.",1327622400,3,1991,4.473829201101928

2005456,5,B0001I551K,"This was a great movie with many simularities but yet many differences from the original Japanese cartoon. I group the old and new ""Battlestar Galactica"" in a simular fasion in which the old and new share commonalities but yet differences which both do not share, like the Cylons, ships, some characters, and the way the show played out. So when viewing this movie don't expect every detail of the cartoon to shine through. Although you will see things you remember from the old you will also see things you did not expect. This is a refreshing movie that is very well done and had enough action to keep you glued to the television. The special effects were fantastic and the plot was very well done. The english captions were a little corney at times but kept very short and to the point so viewing the film was easy. If I understood Japanese the dialog may have been better and more detailed. The film was in 5.1 as well. It was a great treat to see the story of Yamato come to life and I think this would have made a great series simular to ""Star Trek"" or ""Battlestar Galactica"" with the quality the show has, if the writers would have taken it in that direction. If you are going to pick apart and compare every facet to the old cartoon you will BE disappointed. If you are like myself and want to see the cartoon come to life and don't mind some changes you will NOT BE disappointed. I feel this is a must have for anyone who loves the Adventures of (Space Battleship Yamato) or (Starblazers). For the price of this DVD it is easy for you to decide. The only bummer is that you must watch all the ads before getting to the main menu and a few more when you actually play the movie.",1326067200,,1686,4.321766561514195

2005459,2,B0001I551K,"When I first found out about a live action Japanese version of Starblazers last year I was thrilled, finally one of my favorite cartoons as a kid gets a movie version! Well having just watched the video I waited so long to become available in America, I have to say I am very disapointed. It only follows the basic plot slightly. Other reviews mentioned changes in characters genders and some slight differences in storyline. I found the whole movie to be changed for no perceivable benefit.
It was more like a Japanese melodrama set in space that slightly resembles the Starblazers plot. Yes it has the Argo (here rightfully called the Yamato) but with hardly any explanation about its technology or how it was built. The ship in the cartoon was a major draw as a kid, here it is merely transportation. They only fired the wave motion gun twice. Maybe three times if you count the ending depending on how you see it. The DVD itself was an OK transfer in picture quality with decent subtitles. The copy I purchased on Amazon had about 12 minutes of comercials and previews that could not be skipped or fast forwarded through at the start. Overall if your a fanboy you might be happy if you can overlook the differences. I found it to be a poor rendition of a childhood favorite. A ScyFy channel version at best (thats being very generous). Wait for your friend who's a devoted fan to buy it then you can borrow it.

The CGI wonderfully captures my impression of the ship, and the depictions of space are absolutely beautiful.  Keep in mind this is a Japanese film, which introduces cultural differences in plot development and cinematography from American films.  This also limits the overall production budget and prevents as many of those beautiful star/galaxy and battle scenes that I would have liked to have seen produced.  This definitely is the case with this film, as they at times trade scene descriptions for actual depictions of scenes in CGI.  You still get to see the Yamato in action several times, but it just leaves you wanting to see more of the weapons in action.  And if they had only lingered on the Yamato traveling through space as much as they lingered on the characters staring at each other!  Still worth the effort for some Star Blazer nostalgia, or for that matter any Battleship fan!",1323216000,2,1035,4.780898876404494
2005463,3,B0001I551K,"There is no greater Starblazers fan than me. By ""Starblazers"" I mean the Quest for Iscandar and Comet Empire series that played back to back to back in America from the late 70s to the early 80s. This excludes the Bolar Wars and any later releases that were produced with different voice actors. Like many fans I got up early before school to watch Starblazers in the morning, and then sprinted home from the bus stop to watch it in the afternoon. And I dressed up as Wildstar for Halloween one year. Later I bought the entire VHS collection for both series that came out in the early 90s. I then upgraded to the DVD versions when they came out, handing down my VHS collection so my little brother could benefit from it. I even own a shrink-wrapped back-up copy of the 2 series on DVD ""just in case"". Maybe I'll hand it down to my grandchildren one day. Speaking of children, I named my first son ""Avatar"" and my second son ""Venture"", and started them on the series when they were 2 years old, and now they are huge fans, too. One year Avatar had a Starblazers-themed birthday party. If I had had 2 daughters I would have named them Tralaina and Nova. I have models of several spaceships, including a large Argo with moving parts and sound effects, and action figures.

Given my almost sacred devotion to the series, it did not surprise me that this first live-action production was overall a disappointment.  As a superfan I felt I had to give it a chance, and I figured it wouldn't be total crap so it was worth owning. I think my kids will enjoy watching it multiple times, but really it's a `B' movie by American standards.

The special effects aren't much better than you'd see in some of the bigger-budget, original movies on the Sci-Fi channel. They're also, in large part, too fast to fully appreciate. By ""fast"" I don't mean the action sequences were too ""short"". I mean the planes flew too fast, the missiles and lasers were too fast and messy. They were more like flashes on the screen than engaging, suspenseful action sequences. The ground fighting scenes were better in this regard, though, and overall I'd give the special effects 3 out of 5 stars.

The writing and the acting, however, really brought the movie down. Frankly I think the cartoon is more emotionally engaging and less cheesy/corny. Of course, just like when fans as kids fell in love with the cartoon in spite of its cheesiness and corniness, kids today will likely not think much of the added cheese and corn in this live action production. However, the adult fan who was hoping the live action movie would improve on that aspect of the series will be disappointed. Maybe the writers did this purposely to try to make it more like the cartoon, or maybe this is considered `A' movie scripting in the Japanese industry. Not sure. As for the acting, Captain Avatar was probably the worst with Nova the best. Wildstar seemed to start out poorly but got better as the movie went on. The writing and acting I would give 2 out of 5 stars.

As for the screenplay/story, the writers did more than compress the 26 episodes of the Quest for Iscandar series into a 138-minute movie. They made significant changes to the plot, like changing the nature of the Gamilons, and merged elements of the Comet Empire series into the story, especially the end. The sex changes for Eager and Dr. Sane aren't too big of a deal, as well as the change to Wildstar's and Vetnure's back stories. But Homer was eliminated completely and the Space Marines brought aboard (that reminds me; I take back what I said about Captain Avatar being the worst actor, that distinction should probably go to Sergeant Knox). Major conflicts with the Gamilons such as at Pluto and Balan aren't even given screen time in montage form (which would have lessened the feeling of being ""rushed"" that other reviewers have complained about). Merging the battle at the Rainbow Galaxy in with the assault on the Gamilon homeland, however, was more forgiveable as a time-saver. As for IQ-9, I don't like what they did with his character for most of the movie, but that scene at Gamilon where he transforms into the form of IQ-9 we know and love, and then starts mowing down dozens of Gamilons with guns in both hands, that was AWESOME! Another thing I didn't like was the relative lack of emphasis on the ship. In the cartoon the ship is almost a character. Not so in this movie. Still the movie does pay homage to several story elements from the cartoon, even using nearly identical camera angles as the cartoon for some scenes.

One good thing I can say about the movie is the soundtrack. Much of the soundtrack is new, which was initially disappointing because the original music from the cartoon is largely what made the cartoon great and where it broke new ground. Never before had a movie-worthy score been written for a cartoon. They could have just re-mastered the old score and used it for the live action movie. However a lot of the new music is really good and has that Starblazers feel, even though some of it seems ill-timed. The cartoon was better about playing music appropriate for the scene. Still, I'd give the soundtrack 4 out of 5 stars, even though the DVD menu is ruined with that horrible pop song they put on there. The animated Starblazers DVDs have way better menus and bonus features, all backed by the original score.

So overall I think this movie is worth seeing once, especially if you are a superfan. But for those fans who have been waiting for Starblazers to be given the heavy, live-action treatment it deserves, you'll have to keep waiting. It's too bad Peter Jackson or someone like that isn't a fan. That's what this series needs: one 3-hour movie for the Quest for Iscandar series and one 3-hour movie for the Comet Empire series; both with top, Hollywood-caliber writing, casting, acting, direction, special effects, and score composition, and a more faithful retelling of the story. I've already got the screenplays in my head. But alas I don't have 100 million dollars to produce them.",1322524800,6,6055,4.632216014897579

I grew up with the wave of Star Wars craze and these awesome new cartoons from Japan.  Star Blazers, along with Robotech, were my favorites.  With Space Battleship Yamato, they effectively managed to squeeze the entire 1st season of Star Blazers into a 2-hour movie.  I told my wife that I had waited 30 years for this movie, and I was very pleased with the quality!  How pleased?  Remembers how excited everyone was to see the Transformers come to life on the big screen?  Well, think ""Transformers Movie"" with a plot!  I mean, a real plot with real characters that is as important (and that you care about) as much as the special effects.  Thankfully, the plot isn't held up by the special effects; rather the special effects are a part of the overall story.  Even my stepson, having never seen the original cartoons, remarked that it was a great movie.

After seeing the movie I went back and found the cartoon series and re-watched it for nostalgia.  They did change a few plot points from the cartoon series, but not in a way that completely guts the original story (and my childhood memories) like so many big-screen adaptations (or ""Special Editions"") have done.  In fact, some of the scenes are frame for frame comparable to the cartoon series which is a real thrill if you notice them.  The changes were made of course to compress the series story into a movie-length story line.  They adapted it very well.

I wish there were more features on the DVD like commentaries or behind-the-scenes stuff, but hopefully this stuff will make it into a new edition.",1321660800,,1633,4.673684210526316

It's more of a curiosity than a complaint.  Also, this movie does try to compress a one year journey thru space into two hours.  This material could easily use two more.  I was delighted with all the nods to the original cartoon series.  There were just so many great moments in the series, I'm sure the editors had a hard time trimming it down.  I am happy to own this film and I hope they do try and make a US version with a more international crew.  This film reminds me of what I like about Star Trek the original series.

I LOVED that show, and thankfuly, it wasn't until i was an adult, that i saw all the flaws, but it doesn't matter. Thats the way i felt about the live action movie, it had flaws, but they didn't matter. The special effects were great, the design changes to some of the ships like the Cosmo Tigers fighter craft were subtle (Didn't like the big change to the Cosmo Zero though), the cast was good (even the sex changes), though i didn't know any of the actors, and i liked how they made Yuki (Nova) a pilot (plus she's hot). The main things i didn't like were how they changed the Gamilons, and that they made it to Iscandar and back, they could've ended the movie with them still on the mission and the movie wouldn't have felt so rushed. I didn't not like the ending, but the feeling of them rushing through the movie, like it was going too fast did bother me. Seeing that the original cartoon was so huge in Japan & america, i would've like to seen a mix of Japanese & american actors (it was the entire earth being destroyed after all). They could've had the characters bilingual. I've seen comments that the creators took alot from Battlestar Galactica (re-imagined), and they did, but it's only fair since the creators of BSG took things from Yamato/Starblazers. Look, in short there's a big difference in culture between America and Japan (obviously), so the Japanese actors mite not apeal to an american audience, or the subtitles, but it is a very good movie, and even though i was slightly disapointed with somethings, i'm glad i bought it, i'm glad i saw it, and i'm glad they made it..........Disney would have done alot worse.",1318723200,2,1754,4.4672897196261685

I wondered how could they capture the first season, twenty-six twenty-plus minute shows, in two plus hour movie... They did a fairly good job.

Space Battleship Yamato is not a bad attempt in recreating that early space opera feel in two plus hours. The CG effects are good, the acting is better than expected and the action was not bad at all so I was glad about that. Yes, much of what was in the TV show is not in the movie but I expect that.

This DVD is subtitled and from what I've read about other subtitled versions on DVD, it's pretty good subtitling. I could have waited for a dubbed version to be released, which I often do, but didn't.

I gave the movie four stars of out five because I did not like how the story line played out in the end. I won't give away what happens but I believe the writers could have done it better. Yes Earth is saved but we knew that was going to happen anyway if you've seen the original show.

So all-in-all, this version of Space Battleship Yamato is worth owning if you were a fan of the original Star Blazers or not.",1318464000,,1217,4.255411255411255
2005475,3,B0001I551K,"I was surprised at how faithful the 2010 live-action SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO movie was to the old anime--right down to the soundtrack. Many of the supporting characters get short-shrift, but that's to be expected when a 26-episode series is adapted into a movie running a bit over two hours long. It's more surprising that a number of minor characters do get their moments to shine.

The effects are more than adequate and seem to be a bit influenced by U.S. science-fiction shows like BABYLON 5 and the remake of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. At the sema time, the Yamato is completely recognizable, like an old friend who I haven't seen in years.",1317859200,,640,4.818181818181818
2005476,5,B0001I551K,"Wow, I just finished watching the movie.  I am aware that a lot of my views on this movie are highly biased by my kid years watching this show in the 80's and now I am 46 and an aerospace engineer - but so what!  The movie plot did not follow the 80's anime exactly but again, so what? The movie fits a kid audience that has grown up.  Absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end in spite of all of the changes and I mirror the view that the Zero should have not been modified as much as it was.  For some it will be too slow, but I would like to add something here about the Japanese culture.  I was watching a documentary about a Japanese bicycle shop.  You go into the shop, design your bike on a computer and they will deliver it to you in 4 days.  The truth is that they could deliver it to you in about 2 days, but the shop (and their culture) feels that you will be more excited if you waited the extra days.  The Japanese know how to be patient - it is something that I wish we knew how to be.  So sure, their dialogue was quite extensive - but that is character development and I didn't mind it one bit.  We rely so much on CGI in our movies that I think most of them are crap.  Their love scenes and love development should teach Hollywood a thing or to about being human and classly.  Didn't mind the subtitles, other countries can make fine movies too.  Hopefully Kodai and Yuki's child will grow up and maybe they will develop a sequel of some kind. I can only hope.",1317600000,,1485,4.044520547945205

  Well here goes Nothing. What can be said about watching an old favorite of mine be turned into a live action movie. The Plot is solid with minor changes between the show from the 70's to modern age. Granted some folks may not like reading there movie as it comes with sub-titles but I have no issues or problems with that. The special effects help to accent the movie. The character acting is also solid and doesn't feel forced. Granted no Emmy nominee's or anything but still a good sci-fi romp. If I have one complete about the whole thing was the over use of the Wave Motion Gun. But hey you can't have everything. All in all though it is worth the money.",1317081600,,906,5.696296296296296

Some of the maneuvers the battleship did in the movie were beyond mediocre.  Maybe this movie should've been done in part 1, part 2, and part 3, like the Matrix.

2005482,5,B0001I551K,"Let me just say that I saw a trailer for this film several months ago, and ever since then I have been trying to track this film down or at least ascertain when it would be coming out on either DVD or BluRay. Well, that time finally came and while it may NOT be a Domestic US release of the film I think for the time being this is the best we will be able to hope for.

The film is well above the stereotypical Toho fair of Godzilla, Mothra, or King Gidora and I was actually quite surprised when I saw the Toho logo pop up on the opening title cards for the film. This is a well thought out, executed, acted script and film and I don't think that I can extend it praises high enough to describe how well this film actually does. The effects are quite well executed, the acting is well above board, the soundtrack is orchestral and moving and the characters, at least in my experience, are ones that you can connect and care about and actually worry as to what will happen to them. The only issue that I can possibly have with this film is this: the plot of this film strongly mirrors/ if not completely retells the story of the animated film ""Final Yamato"" from 1983, with a few plot points changed here and there so as to make the film more dramatic.

As far as the DVD print goes, the film is very good quality, I would certainly have liked to purchase this film on BluRay, but being able to find a reasonably priced copy (at anything less than $50) at this time is not possible. The transfer is good, there are some issues I noticed where you can see where they went in to add the subtitles to the film you'll see the brief pause in the frame then it will jump back to play after the subtitles have been added. There are also issues at a couple points in the film where there will be characters talking but no subtitles to understand what is being said, but in some cases you can just guess what the character is saying and fill in the necessary dialogue yourself. These are really minor cosmetic issues in my opinion and as I said at this time it does not seem that there will be a domestic US release of this film, though I could be wrong, so for the time being we will have to settle for this reasonably priced foreign release that is an ALL region DVD.

So to break it down:
Acting=Excellent
Effects=Excellent
Soundtrack/Audio Effects=Excellent
DVD Transfer=Good (Subtitle Frame Problems Aside as well as missing Subtitles when characters are talking)
Plot=Good (As I said this is an almost direct retell/rework of the 1983 animated film ""Final Yamato"" but it does do a good job despite that and if you're not familiar with the source material i.e. the animated series and the films you can work around that)
Price Point=Excellent (As I said a FAIR price for this is $20 WITH S&H, while I would have liked to see it on BluRay the only ones available at time of this purchase are roughly $50 including S&H)

If you're a fan of science fiction, and a fan of Toho, a fan of anime, or a fan of Space Battleship Yamato, then I strongly recommend this film. It was an overall wonderful experience that I found myself drawn into to the point that at several points I cried while watching this film.

Once again Yamato has sailed into my heart and I couldn't be happier.

HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1316217600,,3305,4.357142857142857
2005483,5,B0001I551K,"This version of the film isn't perfect, but it's good enough for now.  Pans often display a bit of the shimmering effect which can be seen in certain on-demand transfers. It doesn't look like there will be a domestic R1 DVD release of the film coming out at any time in the near future, so this version is definitely adequate.

I wanted to clarify the situation of the incomplete subtitles that was mentioned in Kenneth Siller's review. There are no instances of an entire scene with missing subtitles, but there are various instances where a specific line of dialogue is not subtitled, or is subtitled incompletely; however, most of them are negligible or leave no room for doubt because the viewer knows precisely what was said. The only significant subtitle omission is in the briefing toward the beginning; from context we can tell that the line was something like ""we have to travel to planet Iscandar to get it"", so it's not too confusing. Shima's brief response to Kodai's order to evade is not subtitled, but it's clear he's not refusing the order; similarly, Kodai's order to fire upon an incoming Gamilas missile is not subtitled; in some of the countdowns the numbers 3-2-1 are not subtitled; Kodai says ""Black Tiger Ace"" where the subtitles just say ""Ace""; Sanada's quizzical repetition of Dessler's ""Alpha and Omega"" is not subtitled, etc. Finally, one of the unsubbed lines was in English already. Thus, there's really only one substantial line that actually feels missing.

In reference to R.K.'s review, the story of the film is not a retelling of ""Final Yamato"". It is primarily a retelling of the Quest for Iscandar plotline as seen in the original Space Battleship Yamato  ( the first season of the series ), with elements borrowed from the second season and the second Japanese theatrical release.",1316131200,,1817,4.8896103896103895
2005484,5,B0001I551K,"The best sci-fi movie in quite some time.  It did deviate quite a bit from ""Quest for Iscandar"", but at the same time it very much held true, and pulled in elements from Iscandar, Comet Empire as well as the movies like Final Yamato.  This was done in such a way as to pay proper homage to the fan base, and be appealing to new fans as well.  Way emotionally gripping, and heart pounding action.  Kinda annoying about the subtitles though, be nice to have a dubbed version.  :)  (and why can't American studios produce anything close to this good on this small a budget?)

(BTW - For the reviews that made comments about the effects resembling the BSG reboot, I don't think so really.  It held true to the original animation from the 70's and 80's, but with cutting edge effects.  WOW that was cool to see the Battle of Pluto (now Battle of Mars) with that level of detail.  In that regard the BSG reboot resembled Yamato from the 70's and 80's, just with state of the art CGI, which as my buddy keeps telling me was ripped off from Firefly.)",1315699200,,1042,4.352331606217617

I am not sure if it was the nostalgia from when I was a little child or the awesome visual effects that made me really love this movie. I do believe (for those who watched the original series) that 2 hours is too litle time to tell the whole story and at moments everything seemed really clustered and forced to fit within the time given to the film.

The script sticks mostly to the original story plot from the cartoon.
 And the actor in the movie are pretty spot on as well to there cartoon counterparts.

2005488,3,B0001I551K,"I've been a fan of the ""Space Battleship Yamato"" TV series called ""Star Blazers"" here in the United States back in 1978.  I've always said that it should be made into a live action movie and in 2010 they finally did it.  When I saw the theatrical trailer online, I said I've got ot see it.  I was hoping that it would be released to theaters here in the United States but that never happened.  That left seeing it on DVD as my last option.  When it finally came out in June of this year, the manufacturer produced DVDs without English subtitles.  That left me out in the cold.

Then I saw this copy called ""Space Battleship Yamato - The final battle.""  I was suspicious but I ordered it anyway because it said it had English subtitles.

When I received it and played it, my suspicions were confirmed.  This copy is a bootleg version.  Here's what's wrong with it.  The movie was shot at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio but on this DVD it's streached to a 1.85:1 ratio.  The movie was recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 but this disc only has Dolby Surround.  Some of the subtitles are either wrong or came across as silly.

On the other hand, it was the best I could get at the time.

However, another company is making copies of this movie on DVD that are superior.  The movie is presented in its full 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it has Dolby Digital 5.1 sound along with the Japanese dialogue and the English subtitles are more accurate.

I bought the new copy and am very happy.  That makes this first copy obsolete and unnecessary.",1314316800,53,1513,4.377697841726619
2005489,5,B0001I551K,"I've been a fan of the ""Space Battleship Yamato"" animated series known as ""Star Blazers"" in the United States back in 1978.

The quality and technology of special effects necessary to pull it off has been achieved and it shows on the screen.  This movie was shot at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and they fill it with action from end to end.

The story is based on the original one seen in the TV series of Earth vs the Gamilons.  The original characters are there more or less.  With that in mind, this is not your father's or grandfather's ""Space Battleship Yamato.""  Some of the differences are interesting, some are shocking.  The way it's crafted, this movie can be enjoyed by those who don't know anything about the TV series as well as long time fans.

This copy produced by Sarawak Media Corporation of Malaysia is near perfect.  The movie is presented in its full 2.35:1 aspect ratio with its original Japanese dialogue and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. It has English subtitles and they are almost complete.  There are 2 or 3 scenes that are missing the caption but it's minor.

This version is far superior to another on being produced on DVD by another company.

2005490,4,B0001I551K,"I saw this movie in Hong Kong, earlier this year.  I made it my mission to see this movie in a theater, instead of waiting for the DVD.  It's not Star Wars (the original trilogy, mind you).  But, if you are/were a Star Blazers fan - you MUST see this movie.

While the plot is a shortened version of the original epic TV series, it is ultimately a re-imagined story.  The result contain some hits and misses.  This is not the Star Blazers of our youth.  Some very adult themes are played out, within the backdrop of Earth's possible demise at stake.  Certain scenes are over dramatic, acted out in hammed-up Shakespearean style, to the point where it was almost ludicrous.  All I can say is, military officers should have more self control, but it is sheer fun.  The plot is in a way reminiscent of Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"".  The Earth will be doomed, if a small band of human beings do not put their differences aside, and fight for humanity's last chance at survival.

Susumu Kodai, a troubled ex-fighter pilot, rejoins the Star Force after ""discovering"" (to put it mildly) a message pod from the far distant planet of Iscandar.  His return immediately clashes with Yuki Mori (female lead, played by the gorgeous Meisa Kuroki) the Yamato's ace fighter pilot, and squadron commander.  As the story unfolds, old friendships are renewed; old bitterness resolved, and a new romance flourishes.  However, despite courageous actions, disciplined training, and dedicated hearts - lives are lost and their mission seem doomed to fail.

The message from Iscandar, offers a cure for Earth's irradiated atmosphere, and a possible alliance.  In light of this, hopes of the people of Earth is renewed, after having resolved themselves to their fate.  Human extinction had seemed eminent, after the devastating defeat of almost the entire Earth defense fleet.  Causing much of Humanity, including our protagonist, to simply give up.  In the beginning of the story, Kodai himself was just a wrech of a man, a bitter self-pitying individual scavenging the wastelands of Earth's surface.  He blames Captain Okita for the death of his brother.

Gathering their remaining resources, the United Space Force's last Battleship is refitted and reconditioned in secret.  Once preparations are completed, and the mission to Iscandar given final approval, the world government offers to the devastated population of Earth one last hope.  They reveal a bold plan, to send off a single crew, aboard the last space-worthy vessel, across the vast span of interstellar space to accept the help of an unknown intelligence.  The Space Battleship Yamato, will make the immense journey to Iscandar, even with little hope that they will ever return.  For the Gamilas has blockaded our entire planet.  When Yamato launches, breaking free of the rock and rubble that has partially encased it, there was definitely a lump in my throat.  In grand Japanese-style, the music soundtrack reflects the boldness and epic nature of their undertaking.  Was the ship partial buried to hide it from the Gamilas?  Is it possible to sneak past their blockade?  It no longer matters.  Once the ship started its journey, the Gamilas are upon them - all the way to Iscandar.  But can it be that simple?  Is there such benevolent beings in the universe that they would reach out to a distant people, just to offer help?  Not quite.

Along with shoot em' up action sequences, there's the subplot of exactly who or what the Gamilas really are, or why they want to destroy us.  In this updated version, the enemy isn't just blue-colored people, the Gamilas are now a race of crystalline creatures devoid of conscience, fear, remorse, or mercy.  Additionally, who are the people of Iscandar?  Can they, in fact, be the Gamilas themselves?  Is the message just some elaborate ruse?  There are some surprises, and some familiar plot points, for old and new fans alike.  The movie also does not miss an opportunity to pay homage to the real Yamato of WWII.  In a dramatic speech, Captain Okita reminds his crew of the previous incarnation of the Yamato, and of that crew's doomed efforts in defending Japan.  Regardless of the outcome, they will do their BEST!

The dog fights in space, were done with the pseudo-realistic zoom-and-shake technique, ala the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica.  The new CGI version of the Yamato is so realistic, it is worth the ticket of admission just to watch the vessel fly-by's, across gas giants and nebulae.  It's what I've always imagined.

The score for the movie is nothing short of spectacular.  A clear homage to the original from the TV series, but now done in grand orchestral scale, with ample use of a background chorus.  A chorus always make a piece of music sound more epic.  I also visited Japan recently.  While there, I came across the soundtrack in Tower Records - Japan.  Even though the Yen was way high compared to the dollar at the time, I felt that it was worth the investment.  I just couldn't wait for it to come to our shores.  Tip - Amazon.com sells it for the same price, so you don't have to go to Japan to get it.

What hope does a small band of Humans aboard a signal ship, with a handful of star fighters, and an untested weapon system have against the vast Gamilas armada?  Captain Okita: ""Action stations!  Inform the engine room to disengage the main drive system.  Prepare to divert all power to charge the WAVE-MOTION GUN.  Kodai, man the targeting system, lock on enemy fleet, directly ahead.  On my mark: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1, FIRE!""",1314316800,,5544,4.803174603174603
