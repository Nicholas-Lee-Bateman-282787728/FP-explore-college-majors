8705137,5,B00UB76NEY,Big Cat shines on this DVD. Various matches from 3-4 different promotions and shows the dominates of his size and ability. Some really good interviews and showing Ladd on both sides of the law. Interesting to see all the old stars in this one.,1476230400,,243,4.545454545454546
8705138,1,B00UB76NEY,What a letdown. This DVD is an insult to the true wrestling fan and the Big Cat Ernie Ladd. Ninety five percent of the matches on this DVD pit Ernie against no names. He had such great feuds with Bruno Sammartino and Chief Jay Strongbow back in the 70's and the best you get are majority no names.,1468800000,,297,4.137931034482759

8705140,5,B00UB76NEY,I was really privileged to see Ernie Ladd when he was a headliner in Los Angeles and a brief time that he competed for Bill Watts in Louisiana. He was truly among the best competitors of the sport that ever lived. This video definitely serves as a fitting tribute to this outstanding athlete.,1444608000,4,292,4.528301886792453
