4449797,4,B004QOB8TS,"Connor and Abby finally return after being stuck without a way home in the Cretaceous era to find much has changed. Though, endless terrifying creatures still emerge through anomalies. New characters come on the scene with secret agendas causing more drama and intrigue.

This third volume of Primeval includes BBC's seasons four (7 episodes) and five (6 episodes). Primeval has extremely short seasons, which I assume is why they package these as ""volumes"" instead of seasons. Unfortunately, this can be confusing, as I read in another new brief that this volume was season three (not so!).

Fantastic special effects, more deadly dinosaurs, mystery, and more plenty of intense suspense - Primeval continues to deliver. This science fiction thriller has developed its story arc to a complex web of characters, subplots, and time periods. While the creature-of-the-week aspect is still there and can be watched as a standalone, watching the episodes in order is certainly preferable. As these short BBC seasons are packed with quite a bit of story.",1327622400,,1048,5.232142857142857

Though many loved characters are missing from the original series, the delightful Andrew Lee Potts and Hannah Spearritt as well as Ben Miller are still around and they did a very good job with adding new characters that you will quickly come to love.  I really hope someone recognizes the talent of Andrew Lee Potts and gives him more and bigger to do soon - he is so talented, funny, and appealing.",1326585600,,510,4.237113402061856
4449800,5,B004QOB8TS,"Primeval one of BBC/ITV greatest hits is back thanks mainly in part to a fan out pour for this show.  A year has passed since Danny Quinn, Conor Temple and Abby Lockhart went through an anomoaly to stop Helen Cutter from destroying the whole of human evolution and things have changed. The ARC research center is no longer under control of the goverment but partialy funded by a private company owned by famed sicentist Philip Burton. James Lester has returned to take charge of day to day operations and hired some new staff. Jess Parker is in control of the ""HUB"" a station within the ARC that monitors the anamolies and dispatches those teams needed to contain it and stop whatever comes out from the other side.  Also on board is former solider and zoologist Matt Anderson who is made team leader with Captain Becker and his men.
  With no way of knowing if any of those who went through the anomoly and a strict policy of not going in they can only move on with the mission. What none of them know is that Abby and Conor have surivied and found another anomoly, but with no idea where it will lead they take the chance and have a dinosuar follwoing them as they make it back to the present.  Word has gotten back to the ARC of there arrival and others behind the scenes also gotten word.
  However coming home for Abby and Connor is not all that great. Connor isn't being allowed to work in the ARC for lack of tranining, Abby is forced to find ways of getting rid of the animals and the more harmless dinosuars housed within the ARC. Both are concerned that the new team leader Matt may have an agenda of some kind. Becker won't talk about what happened when he and former ARC member Sarah Page
went through to find and rescue them.
  This season picks up where the last left off and you will not be disappointed by it. With more twists and turns then ever before the past and the future comes colliding in the present like never before. To check out Primeval today!",1326240000,14,1972,4.395604395604396
4449801,5,B004QOB8TS,"Both the ""Editorial Review"" posted here at Amazon and the description on Internet Movie Database make this Volume Three of ""Primeval"" sound like Volume Two.  Volume Two introduced Jason Flemyng as Danny Quinn and Laila Rouass as Sarah Page.  It was also, of course, in Volume Two that both Nick Cutter and Helen Cutter meet their ultimate fate.  So how can Volume Three have the Cutters, unless in flashbacks?  I definitely plan on waiting awhile after this becomes available before buying it: I don't wish to end up buying something that BBC simply re-packaged from previous Volumes/Series and called brand new.  So I'll wait till some customers take the plunge and buy this hybrid - and read their reviews before parting with my money.  I absolutely love ""Primeval""; but not quite enough to buy two of every episode.

UPDATE:  I bought this and, though I haven't begun watching yet, it's clear from the description on the back cover that this is a brand new Volume of Primeval.",1324684800,16,979,4.820359281437126

Well, maybe I'm just picky.  I found the appearance of new characters and disappearance of others between seasons a little disconcerting.  If your children like monsters and dinosaurs, this might be a good TV series to purchase -- though you might want to cover their eyes from time to time when the clothes come off.",1420070400,,484,4.783132530120482
4449822,5,B004QOB8TS,"The ""final"" go-round for our intrepid team of dino hunters is a pretty good one. I was very hesitant, at first, to watch this when I learned that half of the cast from the previous volumes had changed. In fact, I had this sitting on my shelf for almost two years before I begrudgingly got around to checking it out. I had introduced my wife to the first couple of volumes years ago. She enjoyed them as much as I did and we wondered if they'd ever make more. When I found that another volume did exist I bought it right away, but then promptly forgot about it. We recently dug out the first 2 sets to watch again, when I remembered I had this next one. Turns out I needn't have worried, because volume three of PRIMEVAL is every bit as fun & engaging as the previous ones. In fact, the tightly woven, cross-pollinating story threads are perhaps even better constructed than the previous adventures. The new cast members took some getting used to, but we warmed to them soon enough. It was also a treat to see a couple of ARC team members from past seasons make guest appearances in this latest volume.

The visual FX here in Volume 3 are much improved from those in the previous two volumes. The spinosaurus and T-Rex look great! Those who grumble about the quality of the CGI need to remember that PRIMEVAL is a low budget British TV series, not the latest zillion dollar franchise product from Hollywood. Sure the critters are a little crude, especially in the earliest episodes from Volumes 1 & 2, but they served the purpose of the story. Apparently I am more forgiving since I come from the days of old school visual effects, where dinosaurs and other fantastical creatures were most often represented by hand puppets, magnified iguanas with rubber fins glued to their backs, jittery stop-motion animation, and of course those fellows in the Far East, stomping around miniature H/O Scale cityscapes wearing heavy vulcanized costumes. Younger folks have simply been spoiled by today's hyper-realistic CGI. It seems they simply don't know how to suspend their disbelief and just have FUN using their imagination. Too bad, so sad.

And to the handful of reviewers who dismiss the characters as thinly-sketched and one-dimensional and scoff that the stories are preposterous junk and who wrote off the whole PRIMEVAL series after watching only one or two episodes or, worse yet, part of one show?!?!?!? Really?!? How sad and pathetic are you? Hate to break your elitist bubble gang, but EVERYTHING you see now on TV or at the movies has ALL been done before in some way or another. There is NOTHING new - ANYWHERE. The joy comes from finding new ways to interpret old ideas and present them from a fresh perspective. Personally, I love dinosaurs, so ANY chance to see them interact with humans is at least going to get my attention. Plus I found the idea of time anomalies and the concepts behind them fascinating. I was willing to give the storytellers a chance and gladly immersed myself in the fantastical world these folks had built. More's the pity for you sad, self-important souls who imagine that you're above such ""nonsense."" I also have enough of an attention span, unlike today's A.D.H.D., shaky-cam, jumpcut generation, to sit still long enough to find out what's going on and actually figure things out for myself without having plot points spoon-fed to me, and I enjoy learning about things in their own good time. To those who cannot (or will not)... my sympathies.

This show is fast-paced, entertaining, family-friendly (for the most part) and above all: FUN! I've already placed the sister Canadian-made series PRIMEVAL: New World, on my Wish-List, even though it only lasted one season. Too bad there are apparently no immediate plans to make further adventures any time soon. I'd gladly buy more in an instant if they would. 5 STARS for PRIMEVAL: Volume Three!",1419638400,5,3881,4.763744427934621

I'd stick with it if somehow the BBC decided to bring it back again.

4449854,5,B004QOB8TS,"I got hooked on Primeval when it debuted, in reruns, on PBS, in late 2013, and after seeing one or two episodes, decided that I wanted to have the whole series. So, I ordered all of it at once. As of January 2014, I have just finished volume three and it rocks. I love sci-fi, and I love dinosaurs, and time travel, and all the jazz that this show is built around. This show has great mystery, great intrigue with the new characters introduced in this volume, and it is phenomenal. Added to that, it is a family friendly show with very little profanity in the whole series, and especially little in this volume; no sexual improprieties exist in this show, so I can watch it with family and have no qualms.
This is a great sci-fi show, and I only wish that there was more to it. I highly recommend Primeval to all fans of good television be it suspense, sci-fi, mystery, or serials, as it fits in all of them and will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I watched this volume through in less than two weeks it was so edge of your seat compelling. If you don't get it, you don't know what it is that you're missing.",1390780800,,1127,4.1981566820276495

4449858,5,B004QOB8TS,"Primeval is a show where portals to the past and future open up and allow anyone or anything to traverse its way through to the other side. Hows that for a premise to a show? The story-lines are well thought out and the characters develop nicely. The show is very entertaining and has it's moments of greatness. Volume 1 contains seasons one and two. Both seasons together only make up 13 episodes. Now, BBC could have sold each season separately and charged a lot for each one, they did not. They combined the two seasons to give us a fair amount of episodes for our money. I applaud them for that. There are a total of 3 volumes that make up the whole series. My only complaint is that the 3rd volume does not contain the webisodes that are a prequel to the 4th season. But, they are easily found on youtube. The show does not hold with the traditional main characters must survive to the next episode. As you will see main characters die in this series or disappear. *****SPOILER ALERT**** The show starts out with the discovery of what they call anomalies (doorways into the past or future) and our first main character ends up creating a team to investigate these anomalies, with ulterior motives, he wants to find his missing wife. At some point he finds a camera with her picture in the past along with a campsite that has a dead body (not his wifes). In the next season we discover his missing wife is alive but with an ulterior motive of her own. As the series progresses we discover that she wants to destroy all of the human race to make way for a new dominant species to take over the planet as we have destroyed the planet in our future. She eventually kills her husband when he goes back into a burning building to save her, but that takes place in the third season. The new leader of the team ends up killing the wife at the end of that season, but ends up stuck in the past. By the 4th season most of the original casts sans 3 people have been replaced due to being killed off or lost. I am not certain why the writers did this but it lends a certain reality to the series. In that, anyone can be killed or lost. Two of the lost members do return and eventually regain their place on the team. By this time, the organization that tracks the anomalies is being co-run by a scientist played by Alexander Saddig (Dr. Bashir from Deep Space nine). Here he plays a very different character. ****Spoiler Alert Over****

It's a great show, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction, or anyone who is just interested in a look at what might happen if our past present and future merged through portals that show up randomly and in the strangest places.

My only complaint is they took out ""Don't Stop Movin'"" by S Club 7 from the first episode and switched it with some other non-descript rock song. It was a great in-joke in regards to lead actress Hannah who was a member of that group and it was a funny moment. I realize the band didn't make it as big in the U.S. and viewers wouldn't have gotten the joke. Still, there are few fans here who would have appreciated it, plus that S Club 7 song worked much better for the scene and was still funny having a dinosaur terrorizing the heroes to a dancing pop beat.",1373932800,,653,4.274193548387097

4449886,5,B004QOB8TS,"If you like adventure, time travel, dinosaurs, romance, friendship, danger, dragons, mutants, ecology, three dimensional characters or British TV, Primeval is a must!

This season sets up some really remarkable plot twists, threats and character development, and does answer some lingering questions. I'm allergic to spoilers, so that's as much as I'll say.  Don't start here if you are new to the series, but if you have seen Primeval and are familiar with the characters & the universe, this season is definitely worth the price.

If you haven't seen Primeval, I recommend starting at episode 1 Season 1.  There are continuing arcs throughout the seasons which are well worth following, beginning to end.",1355443200,,706,5.221238938053097
4449887,5,B004QOB8TS,"I'm hooked on this series. If you enjoyed Terra Nova, King Kong, Back to the Future, The Time Machine, Jurassic Park, Journey to the Center of the Earth, for example, then you will probably enjoy this BBC series.

Rifts in space and time are doors to the past and the future and monsters are traveling to today's London and its suburbs. A team of British scientists and Special Forces military types have been brought together by the UK's government to deal with this invasion of past and future monsters while struggling to cover the incursions up so it will not panic the people.

With raptors and tyrannosauruses running wild through the forests, buildings and streets eating people, it is a challenge to keep this a secret.

I'm currently watching season three and plan to buy series four and five once the DVDs are available in the US. I see that both 4 and 5 are available in Blue-ray meaning I may have to break down and buy a Blue Ray player.",1354838400,,950,4.543859649122807
4449888,3,B004QOB8TS,"The new characters are OK. The creatures that came through the anomolies are too much like the ones in other episodes: alligator type, carnivorous worms from the fog etc.

The Spinosaurus [spelling?] wasa good addition, but there are so many more too choose from.

How about Megalodon, Liopluradon, Basilosaurus, Kronosaurus, in the seas.

OR, Pulmonscorpius, Madtsoia [snake like 60 feet. These could swallow an Anaconda or Asian Python with no trouble.], Gigantopithecus [ape-like], and let's not forget the Epicyon, the great predator of the North American grasslands. Epicyon would eat Bison, Moose, Wolves andlions for lunch if around today.

Want terror just add one or two of these and see them run!

Yes I was a dinosaur ""kid"" when growing up.

How about a new creature from the future? Digital CGI can do a lot more!

Seemed much like the same old same old.

Of course now they have to have the ""love"" interests more, sexual tension, or it wouldn't be TV. That's OK, as they are human.

Well, I bought it and paid for it. Guess I will keep it. Not as enjoyable as say:BSG. BUT, I do like the series overall. Will wait to see what the new Primeval in North America looks like when it is finally produced.

Enjoy, as I did! It is still worth the money for the entire series.",1348704000,,1281,4.653333333333333

You can almost feel the jaws of the T-Rex and Spinosaurus clamping down on you. The way it ends makes you want more but if this is last episode you are left hanging a little. My daughter fell in love with the series and I'll be sending my copy to her. A great series.

Almost all guys love dinosaurs. We went crazy for Jurassic Park so when Terra Nova debuted this past year I had my popcorn ready.
It was OK. It should have been great. After all, it was filmed in south-east Queensland, Australia (the same location for Jurassic Park) and Steven Spielberg was one of the executive producers. The premiere did draw 9.22 million viewers making it  the best result by a new drama. However, FOX Broadcasting stated that no decision will be made until 2012 regarding the continuation of the series.
Thank goodness for Primeval, a British science fiction series, where the dinosaurs are better and the plot easier to follow.
Professor Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) and his assistants, Stephen Hart (James Murray), Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts), and Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) investigate the appearance of anomalies that allow time travel and space-shifting. They have created an area called ARC where some of these creatures are kept.
By series four the ARC has been updated and rebuilt with a new team leader Matt Anderson (Ciaran McMenamin) who appears to have a hidden agenda.
While seeking out these creatures, the team discovers a pair of time travellers have arrived from the Victorian era. The strange Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathon Byrne) and Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley) who Matt has a soft-spot for.
Series 4 and 5 will be released on Blu-Ray and DVD in the United States on Jan. 10, 2012.",1331683200,,1488,5.044715447154472

The emotions expressed on ""Primeval"" feel real and i find myself pulled into each episode..i feel like i am there...All the characters seem to be fully formed..and going in directions with their lives..that feel real. Hannah Spearritt is now showing incredible strength and maturity .. in her role on the show...If you love Sci-Fi buy ""Primeval:Volume Three!"" .I bought mine on Amazon and it arrived in great shape..early.

4449894,3,B004QOB8TS,"Legions of fans were left hanging about the fate of three faves, Connor, Abby, and Danny. This badly-named Volume 3 actually contains all of Series 4 & 5. It's a treat to finally see who, when, and how they made it back (one, quite temporarily) to the contemporary land of coffee and deodorant. Although Irish director Robert Quinn isn't given credit as a director on the box (who did he get in a fight with?), he does a great job bringing out the best in a super cast of hard-working actors. And many scenes are filmed in Ireland (many shots of ""London"" are actually Dublin), county Wicklow's seaside caves are sanctuary for creatures in Series 4, episode 5. Following this, episode 6's Irish castle features another past cast-member. The addition of the fine Alexander Siddig is always a good bet, though his part is rather thankless, and Ciarn McMenamin is great too. The Victorian element also adds complexity as past, present, and future hang in the balance. Andrew-Lee Potts ought to be given a shot at Doctor Who, at the very least, and Hannah Spearritt gives a nuanced and fine performance, worthy of any theatre-trained actor, given the material. Ben Mansfield reliably lends credibility.

The down-side: Producers clearly saved money by under-staffing ARC. The lack of personnel is quite obvious, making plot-lines that much more difficult to believe. As well, there's a dolorous lack of humor in too many stories, humor leavened past series, lifting Primeval to a higher level. Sadly, the show suffers from the lack of the gleefully villainous Helen, the excellent Alexander Siddig isn't given much to chomp on. Overall, everyone seems less happy, less vital, and there's far too little of the delightful Rex. Even mad Helen lent a crisp and biting humor. Now, we only see one character's austere (Dublin, not London) home, gone are all the playful scenes with Rex, Abby, and Connor in her flat. Missing are the costly visits to beautiful primeval worlds, sooty Victorian London and a terrible future-scape are the only portals much explored. Though this is done very well, fans may miss the previous series' spectacular scenes of dinosaur country, contrasting present-day environs with scenes filmed to looked like a cross between New Zealand and Hawaii. Still, fans are compelled to give it a go, and hope for more!

If you haven't seen them, previous Primeval is even better:

8438381,5,B004QOB8TS,"This is the final two series of what is probably one of my favorite shows of all time. I was so disappointed when they took it off of Netflix. So buying the DVD sets was a no-brainer.

There are a bunch of new characters that are actually introduced in the 5 webisodes released just before the fourth series. As well as some plots twists. So if you haven't watched those I would suggest heading to Youtube and watching them first. Not required but it does clear up some things.

While the last two series I don't feel quite the same level of involvement, they are still well written and produced. If there is a weakness in the series it is that they kill off a lot of lead characters seemingly on a whim. Good stories but it seems like you are always having to figure out the new people. From the original series the only ones left are Connor, Abby and Lester. I like Jess but she came out of left field. Matt and Emily and confusing is some ways. Philip is interesting but I'm not sure if he's an villain, anti-hero or Dr Bashir. April is really just a unnecessary person to keep track of. If this were Star Trek she would be the red shirt who dies in each episode. They try to make her a villainess but she's just unbelievable and silly.

Overall it is still 5 stars. I never get tired of rewatching this. I'm thrilled to have the whole set on DVD.",1468886400,,1350,4.245136186770428
