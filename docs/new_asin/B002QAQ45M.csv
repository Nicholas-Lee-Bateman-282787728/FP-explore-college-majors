the cover of the korean version is silly, campy, and does not do the depth of the film justice at all - which is not about some stupid gallivanting as a tramp or some weird girl with a helmet. it's about fear, loneliness, and overcoming the things that are killing us while we are still alive.",1322352000,6,435,4.304878048780488
3966569,5,B002QAQ45M,"One of the most different and best movies I've ever seen. My new favorite movie. Little dialogue, good acting, well-shot scenes and cinematography tell a story that I've never seen told before in movies. In this day and age of the internet and of human identities formed by consumerism we may very well have an inkling of what issues and emotions the two main characters are going through. I will say that when the main character finally gets to enjoy a satisfying meal(not giving away details) I did not expect his reaction, but I was thoroughly gratified by that scene. So without giving away the whole plot of the story I highly recommend this movie. Really quirky, full of unexpected details and surprisingly delightful!",1321747200,8,724,4.846774193548387
3966570,5,B002QAQ45M,"I've been really into watching Korean movies lately.  Castaway on the moon is a fairly serious commentary on modern life. The commercialism, greed, consumption, our reliance on modern 'necessities' and our resulting crippling alienation from each other in the process.  While the overall them is quite heavy this movie has some pretty funny moments in it.  I found myself laughing out loud, crying and rooting for the characters - there are some very touching moments.  It is beautifully filmed...a near perfect film in my opinion.  So much about it works on so many levels.  The dichotomy of the hero being shipwrecked on an island in the middle of a bustling city-so close yet so far away.  A perfect metaphor for how so many of us live our lives today.  The heroine that has a self imposed alienation from the world, living in a virtual world, afraid of human contact also speaks to the modern way of life.

  There are some films that stay with you long after the last credits roll.  This is one such film.  It is truly amazing...easily one of the best films I've seen probably ever.

  I was really very surprised by how much I truly liked this film and found myself telling everyone about it.  I hope you'll take the time to give this film a watch",1321660800,20,1253,4.597285067873303

3966572,5,B002QAQ45M,"Eine wunderbar skurrile Story ber zwei unglckliche Menschen, die ein Zufall zusammenfhrt.
Ein junger Mann hlt den Stress im grostdtischen Leben nicht mehr aus und will sich durch einen Sprung von einer Brcke umbringen, was ihm milingt.
Er findet sich zwar mitten in der Zivilisation, aber auf einem vllig isolierten kleinen Inselchen wieder, wo er robinsonhnlich mit den Unbillen der Natur umgehen lernen mu.
Ein Mdchen, das nur noch im virtuellen Raum lebt und niemals unter echte Menschen geht, entdeckt den jungen Mann zufllig aus ihrem Fenster und wird neugierig auf ihn. So neugierig, da sie sich auch wieder - wenn auch wohl gerstet - ins Freie wagt.

Beide gesunden schlielich an sich selbst - wie es dazu kommt, soll hier aber nicht verraten werden.

Ich selbst habe den Film ""aus Versehen"" auf einem Langstreckenflug gesehen (hatte einen anderen Film erwartet, bin dann aber drangeblieben) und der Film hat mich derartig begeistert, da ich ihn auch Familie und Freunden vorfhren wollte. In Europa nicht zu kriegen war ich glcklich, bei amazon.com fndig zu werden.

Empfehlenswert fr alle, die Humor und Tiefgrndigkeit nicht fr unvereinbar halten.",1257897600,3,1155,5.232432432432432
3966573,5,B002QAQ45M,"Unexpected movie about two people who simultaneously rescue and seduce each other in the most bizarre, hands off way you'll ever see. Highly moving metaphors and poetry in this plot. Beautiful soundtrack.",1355961600,3,204,5.40625
3966574,5,B002QAQ45M,"Castaway on the Moon is a fantastic film about a suicidal man that ends up stranded on an island (on the Han River) after a failed suicide attempt; while being watched by a young escapist women that hasn't left her home/room in 3 years. They develop their relationship through messages written on a sandy shore and message-in-a-bottle style. The movie works very well as a comedy, drama and romantic film. It all blends together to create an amazing experience. I particularly found the young woman's story to be very touching and interesting as she explains her escapist/lonely lifestyle. It's also amazing to see how these characters develop over time. Kim Seung-Keun, the stranded man, has no idea how to survive in the beginning. But, he eventually gives up and accepts his new life, throws away his materialistic lifestyle- he even uses his credit cards to scrape bird poop!

This film can make you smile, laugh, and even cry. It's not an action or survival film, but it is relatable. The ending was fantastic and keeps pulling at your emotions, the music was great, the acting was brilliant, and the subject is beautiful and deep. I highly recommend Castaway on the Moon. As of 8/18/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

This film does not have any significant violence, but it does have two suicide attempts (not graphic), and it has some brief nudity. (no sex)",1345248000,8,1380,4.843220338983051
3966575,5,B002QAQ45M,"Life isn't treating this guy very well.  His relationship with his girlfriend has gone south, and he is in debt up to his ears.  So it's over the bridge, and goodbye life.  Except, he washes up a few minutes later on an island practically within shouting distance of downtown.

That's the first three minutes.

Wow.  This is one of those movies you just have to take a chance on.  We have ""the five minute test"" on movies that we really are gambling on.  And I have to admit, after the first five minutes, the viewer will be thinking, ""Okay... I now know what this movie is all about.""  WRONG!  The plot gets much more complicated, you don't know where things are going (but you start to guess), and you just begin to empathize with the characters.  Great story.

Highly recommended for all ages.",1329868800,3,796,4.489510489510489
3966576,5,B002QAQ45M,"I would buy this movie in a heartbeat if it were available on DVD here in the States. Most people who live in or have lived in an urban setting could relate at least somewhat to the characters in this movie and their feelings of alienation and being ovewhelmed by modern society and it's multitude of complexities. A young Korean man, who owes a lot of debt, tries to commit suicide by jumping from a bridge on the Han river in Seoul Korea but he ends up not dying but being washed up on an inescapable island in the river. He can see the city from the island but there is no way off. A girl with strong Hikikimori tendencies eventually spots him from her highrise, window telescope but she is so socially withdrawn that the only way she can bring herself to contact the man is with written messages thrown onto the island in bottles from the bridge the guy initially jumped off of. What happens from there forms the gist of the story. It has some amusing moments and some very poignant, touching moments. It's a heartwarming tale. It's somewhat similar to the Tom Hanks movie Castaway but still different enough to warrant watching.  By the time it ended I wanted to watch a sequel (there isn't one) to see what happened next in these people's lives that's how emotionally invested I became in the characters. I love Korean movies but I find most Korean films seem to have rather dark endings as though fate always leans towards suffering but not so in this delightful movie.

Plug in characters A,B and C throw a couple stars in there and run with it.
The end result is a movie that is predictable,boring and lacking of substance.
  This movie was a refreshing change from that, ""I was captivated by this movie!""
What a brilliant way to tell a story and tie in all the character development.
Well done!",1325376000,,444,4.273809523809524
3966579,5,B002QAQ45M,"I saw this movie two years ago at a film festival and have been dying to get a copy of it ever since. It's the most wonderful combination of touching, funny, meaningful, and hopeful I've ever seen. I was delighted to see that Netflix decided to stream it on their website, but I still really want to buy a DVD to share this movie with my friends. Amazon, you gotta get this.",1323820800,,374,4.208333333333333
3966580,5,B002QAQ45M,"I enjoyed this film and so would most others.

The movie is meant to be a critical commentary on the modern Korean society. Much of the humor is subtle and requires an intimate understanding of the Korean society to fully understand it.

The main male character is a very average Korean male. He is always harped-on because he doesn't excel in anything. He went to an average university, works at an average job, and now finds himself entering middle-age with heavy debt and his future now looks fairly bleak. His girlfriend dumps him. He decides to kill himself by jumping off a bridge and that's when his adventure begins.

The main female character suffers from an acute social anxiety disorder and refuses contact with the outside world, even with her family. She lives in a room of her parents' house and texts them whenever she needs something. She never opens her doors (she locks them) except when she needs to wash and use the bathroom.

Based on the above, you can see where this story is going.

The female character is played beautifully by Jung Ryo Won. It isn't an easy character to play. But she comes off not as a crazy nut, but as a deeply vulnerable character who goes to the extreme to shelter herself from the strains of the world. I was very convinced of her character and I was impressed with Jung Ryo Won's acting ability.

I felt the director and the writers could have left few nauseous scene out. There is a scene when the male character licks his body for salt and even gathers his sweat for salt flavoring (ewwww). That imagery almost ruined the movie for me.

Here are the subtleties you may have missed if you are non-Korean:

1)The noodle in the movie is called JaJangMyun. Its delivery is like pizza-delivery in the US and the Koreans consume hundreds of millions of that dish every year (it is quite delicious). The JaJangMyun delivery man is often obsessed with getting the plastic bowl back and nothing pisses him off more than not getting that bowl back (most delivery service now deliver in a disposable bowl). I won't ruin it here by explaining why that's relevant, but that fact comes into play in the funniest scene of the movie.

2)The two main characters communicate in English. In one scene, the male character says in English, ""You are Korean, I am Korean, and we speak in English..."" This is meant to be a criticism of modern Korea, which is so obsessed with learning English that people often talk to each other in English to improve their skill. The two characters only communicate in English until the very end.

3)The air-attack drill scenes are indeed enforced twice a year to prepare for possible North Korean attack. The movie states they are done twice a year but never explains why the Koreans do the drill.",1323734400,30,2761,4.639344262295082
3966581,5,B002QAQ45M,"The two characters (maybe really representing one character needing assimilation?) find their own little world in the midst of what they perceive as a brutal outside, create a means of survival, and find some sense of kinship within each other. Their need for that kinship--or assimilation--is what drives the story and, once their self-created worlds are ruthlessly stolen from them by invaders, they seem to need to find each other to survive. This is beautifully written and well acted and one of the best films I've seen this year. My only question was why they were communicating to each other in English. Is that how one tries to communicate to the outside world in any country now?",1323216000,,688,4.888888888888889
3966582,5,B002QAQ45M,"I don't speak Korean so I wasn't sure about watching this movie, but it was excellent.  The English sub-titles helped, but the story and photography are so well done that you almost don't need the sub-titles.  I highly recommend it for both its humor and romantic plot. The acting is also top quality.  I will never look at black bean paste the same way again.",1322870400,,360,4.507692307692308
8377613,4,B002QAQ45M,"Imagine if Tom Hanks in the movie Castaway was washed up on an island, that wasn't in the middle of the ocean, but instead in the middle of a river, with a traffic/pedestrian bridge's pylons running through it and whatever Korean city this is set in on both sides of the river.  Now you're wondering why he can't just jump back in the river and swim to the bank or at least float there, and with a brief childhood flashback scene where his father gets mad at him for putting no effort into learning how to float let alone swim, we've just got to assume he can't swim or float.  So he's stranded on this bird sanctuary island, frustrated people who can see him are just waving back and no one comes to rescue him.  Like with the Tom Hanks movie, he originally struggles to eat and survive, but eventually he works out how to use his environment, consisting of rubbish, birds and a swan pedal watercraft (again not sure why he couldn't just float away on this), he even has his own version of Wilson.  As he's there longer he begins to accept this is his home now, and hides when boats that he previously screamed at for help, go past.

About half an hour in a new substory starts with a young woman who lives with her parents but never leaves her room, except when her parents are both out to use the bathroom.  I originally thought this was a new independent story and this was a collection of short films about people living in odd situations or something, but it is linked to the stranded guy story by the fact that she looks forward to every time there is bomb drill when everyone must flee to bombshelters, the empty city streets being like the moon (lifeless). She likes to photograph this time and during the siren wailing time notices the occupant on the island, who she naturally as you would, assumes is an alien.  Since he has written help in English in the sand, then over time changes it to Hello, she assumes he's trying to communicate with the earthlings, and knows it is her duty to leave her apartment for the first time and communicate with him through throwing couple of English word messages in a bottle off the bridge.

At first I wasn't that into the film.  It's a hard job for one actor to carry a storyline pretty much on their own.  I didn't initially find Jae-yeong Jeong to be that fascinating, or have done as good as job as Tom Hanks (Castaway), Matt Damon (The Martian), Blake Lively (The Shallows) and others who have done so, but once he grows the beard (as in he's been on the island long enough) he manages to do so.  It ultimately is a pretty enjoyable movie, although you've got to suspend belief especially when he is still in the suit wearing days and wants to get off that no one walking along the bridge above sees him, or other boats don't land on the island to fish or explore or sun-bake, kids aren't jumping off the bridge into the water and stuff like this. You'd think even if they didn't think he needed rescuing someone concerned about animals and the environment would care that he was in a bird reserve and complain to whatever Korean authority you complain to about that.

Definitely if you don't mind reading a good movie, this is an interesting one to check out!",1485820800,,3214,4.410472972972973

8377620,1,B002QAQ45M,"This is saturday matinee guys. I watched this movie and there is nothing spectacular about it. Far from it,there nothing average about it.
It is as Low budget as you can get. The entire film is shot on 2 Locations. And there is a final 3rd location towards the end.(No spoilers)
As the guy jumps into the river and gets transported automatically to an island,you spend most of the time watching him dole out his
shenanigans in a bid to spend more time on the island. The problem is,when we talk about Island,it is very restrictive. There is absolutely zero exploration of Island. The entire movie is spent showing a man stranded on a stationary spot,where the Camera zooms on and off.
The other location is about a girl watching him from her apartment room. This is what you are going to see in the entire movie,with a last scenario towards the end,shifting gears slightly.
The plot is nothing to write home about. It is very simplistic. There are no curve balls or twists,in the whole movie. Some people say it is
very charming. I found the charms 10 times  more evident in 'Hayao Miyazaki' movies.
To be honest Korean Cinema is a fledgling industry. They still have a long way to go before we compare these movies with Japan and Hong Kong cinema.",1374105600,,1248,4.571428571428571
