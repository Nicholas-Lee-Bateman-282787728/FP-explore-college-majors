3565753,4,B001F7Q4J8,The movie was on my list to see -- though I wasn't expecting much. But I laughed all through the movie.  And some of the latent jokes would take an older audience. I am buying the movie -- so that speaks for itself.,1228953600,3,215,4.0

We lasted 15 minutes before I turned it off. My sons weren't laughing.

Much of the film's humor is based on cultural references and puns that rocket over the heads of the primary audience.

If that wasn't bad enough, the main character, Ham III, is crude, annoying and a bad role model for kids. I was irritated to explain to my sons that Ham calling another chimp a ""dork"" is neither funny nor appropriate to repeat.

I don't recommend this film to parents of young children, especially as there are three animated films this year alone -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B0013FSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Panda/dp/B001ECQ75A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Panda</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horton-Hears-a-Who/dp/B001DPHDCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horton Hears a Who</a>&nbsp;- that all offer superior animation and storylines.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. NASA loses probe in wormhole
2. To account for losing the billion dollar probe, they plan to send a billion dollar space craft after it, piloted by a team of chimps
3. To get full media coverage, they decide to send a celebrity chimp, and since Lance Bass wasn't available, they choose Ham III (voiced by Andy Samberg)
4. Ham III is the grandson of Ham I (I bet you figured that out on your own), the first chimp in space, III being currently employed as a simian cannonball with a circus.
5. Ham III, Lt. Luna (Cheryl Hines), and Commander Titan (Patrick Warburton) become space chimps
6. Lots of monkey business follows as the intrepid team go boldly where no chimp has gone before, to an inhabited planet ruled by cold-hearted Dictator Zartog (Jeff Daniels)
7. This is actually a much better movie than it sounds

This underrated cartoon is actually a lot funnier than you'd think.  The animation won't make Pixar lose any sleep, but is pretty good anyway, and the humor will tickle your funny bone without ever once resorting to lowbrow potty jokes.  [Note: Beware of the puns]

Although not in the class of Wall-E or Finding Nemo, this is one that can be enjoyed by the whole family.

Rated: 3.5 stars

A wise cracking smart aleck circus chimp (voiced by Andy Samberg) is tricked into accompanying two other chimps (Cheryl Hines & Patrick Warburton) on a mission to another planet (because it might be too dangerous to send people).  Once there, they run afoul of a childish despot named Zartog (voiced by Jeff Daniels).
At best, this is a cute effort that acts as a minor distraction.  Kids will probably like it.  It's filled with bright colors, a lot of patter, and no end of silliness.  There are some substantial voice talents at work here, including Jane Lynch as Dr. Poole, Stanley Tucci as the Senator, and Kristin Chenoweth as Kilowalawhizasahooha.

ABOUT THE MOVIE:
It's about 3 chimps that are sent into 'outer space' to look for a planet that contains life. When they are about to land on a planet, turns out the 2 chimps in charge are 'passed out' and won't wake up to land the Space-ship, so it is then up to the more 'imature' chimp to save them from sertain death.. When he lands the ship, without thinking he steps out the ship, not aware of the dangers.. The planet has 'Living beings' that look nothing like we do, and are no friendly.. They capture the chimps but the chimps fool the creature's ""Lord"" and escape. After they get rid of that mean leader, the inteligent living creatures help them build a ship to get back to Earth.. Meanwhile in Earth, NASA waits for the chimps to return, but then when the ship returns home they discover the ship is empty so the Mayor (i think) cancel's the program (send chimps to find new world).. But the 3 chimps do make it back home, and with the 3 chimp's successful return, NASA (and the Mayor) suddently decide that instead of canceling the program, there gonna send the chimps back to the planet to make sure that that the chimps really did discover other living beings in that planet.. :D

I CAN KEEP ON TELLING YOU MORE ABOUT THE MOVIE BUT IT ONLY GETS BETTER AND BETTER, BUY or RENT THE MOVIE, YOU WONT BE DISSAPPOINTED I PROMISE.. Part 2 IS THE CONTINUATION OF THIS GREAT ADVENTURE, I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT.. :)",1312848000,3,1682,4.2367601246105915

3565811,2,B001F7Q4J8,"I have to come right out and say this; I don't know why this came out in theaters. Was it because of the ""kid factor""? Was it really an alternate to The Dark Knight?

Space Chimps is about a probe that gets sucked into a black hole and the chimpanzees who are assigned to retrieve it.

The main character is named Ham III. His grandfather, Ham I, was the first chimp in space. The grandson Ham follows in his grandfather's footsteps by joining a circus and getting shot out of a canon and landing on a drum set.

When the probe is lost, the space program decides to send the chimps after it because it may be too dangerous for humans and they want Ham III to go to add some ""spice"" to the marketing.

Meanwhile, the probe has landed on a distant planet where the bully gains control and terrorizes the other creatures. It's up to the chimps to rescue the probe and get home.

So it's a cartoon right? A computer generated cartoon. The jokes are quite lame. There were times where I allowed myself to give some polite laughter, maybe a subtle chuckle; but I cannot believe this was not a direct-to-DVD film.

Space Chimps stars the voices of Andy Samberg as Ham III, Cheryl Hines as Luna, Patrick Warburton as Titan and Jeff Daniels as the evil Zartog.",1294099200,,1251,4.370689655172414
3565812,5,B001F7Q4J8,"It's true what they say: Stick with your opinion even if it isn't fashionable.  And such is my feelings for Space Chimps.  I thoroughly enjoyed this animated feature.  It had everything I look for (intelligence, humor, an interesting plot, crisp visuals) in an animated feature without going overboard as is so often the temptation with this type of film.

Then, before coming online to share my own approval of the picture, I made the mistake of browsing what others (amateur critics especially) had to say about it.  The fact is, not a whole lot of good! Now I'm not suggesting that their nay-saying swayed my opinion any, I am however rather surprised that mine was the popular consensus as I tour any and all animated features from Pixar's blush-worthy budgeted blockbusters to some of the quietest little releases to hit the States (Pinocchio 3000 and The Snurks for example) and feel Space Chimps offers a lot to love.  Both the New York Times and Roger Ebert heaped praise upon it however.  Is it possible that it demands a certain level of intelligence to fully appreciate this one? Who can say for sure?

The tale tells of a hi-tech earthen space probe that veers off course thanks to an unexpected riff in the space-time continuum (that's a worm hole to you and me).  It ends up on an uncharted planet, the likes of which is too distant and uncharted to risk sending a crew of human beings for retrieval.  The solution presents itself by looking at our own past (and how we used to do things); a team of NASA chimpanzees is assigned the retrieval mission.

Chimps, it turns out, can communicate with one another as clearly as we human beings can but to us their language appears little more than chirps squeaks and hand gestures.

Enter Ham III (Andy Samberg), the grandson of the first chimp astronaut, along with two other primates (Titan; Patrick Warburton and Luna; Cheryl Hines) are blasted off into space by an opportunity-seeking senator.

Soon, the fun-loving chimp discovers that doing the right thing involves more than simply retrieving the downed probe: It turns out this far-away planet's citizens are under oppression by a nefarious leader. Fortunately for Ham III and his simian peers, the technology giving this dictator his powers just so happens to have come from earth.

So that's the plot- nothing too insulting so far right? Well there's quite a bit of humor along the way and contrary to what you might suspect looking at a film of this nature, much of it is actually intelligently written witty dialog rather than in-your-face slapstick (again leading me to suspect that many of the harsh words viewers have written about this one stem from the lack of juvenile antics).

Perhaps the greatest strength indeed is Andy Samberg, Patrick Warburton and Cheryl Hines' characters genuine and witty exchanges.  The personality spectrum of the three lead antagonists is quite flawless with a counterpoint to each of the other's points. Small things like the turbulence training to pass through the wormhole or that the ship's controls are in fact make-believe as humanity is convinced no chimp could actually fly the craft anyway make for some humorous moments.  As does the ship's landing sequence.

In all it's truly unfortunate that this film seems to flounder in negative reviews because quite honestly I am thoroughly convinced that there are countless over-hyped films that fail to elicit a fraction of the charm found here.  Apparently, though, 20th Century Fox views the project successful enough to warrant a sequel to arrive on DVD October 5th.  Sometimes the best response to the nay-sayers is to say nothing at all, but rather to allow the film to do what it was meant to all along.",1283817600,2,3718,4.862123613312203

This was a lot better than expected, but I shouldn't have been surprised. Big-budget animated movies are now the most reliably intelligent fare coming out of Hollywood (or Vancouver, as here). Space Chimps keeps that run alive; it's a very bright, funny and engaging 80 minutes.

Samberg hits all the right notes, as do Hines and the enjoyably inimitable Warburton, but Chenoweth steals the voice show with her ultra-cute and quite funny turn. Tucci is also good, but I'd rather have heard Ian McShane's menacing rumble---he should be in every cartoon out there.

The animation ain't Pixar but it's light years beyond what we saw ten years ago, and some of the scenes are real eye candy, with lush, deep tones that blu-ray makes come alive. It's a very good-looking film that will make your plasma or lcd screen shine.

All in all, Space Chimps is very recommended to parents who want to watch a clever and well-done film with their kids, with no fear of overly adult moments or language.

This one will age well.",1260057600,,1024,4.730337078651686

Put them in a movie together and you get; boring?

Okay, so not a movie, but an animated film.  I would never have guessed that two of my favorite comedians (well, not favorites, but I like them very much) would NOT perform very good voice over work.  I really thought that they would excel here, but they are bland and uninteresting.  Patrick Warburton, on the other hand, should do EVERY cartoon, seriously.  In fact, if it weren't for his quick wit and stellar voice skills I would have given this mundane monkey mess ONE star.  He bumps this drudgery up to a D grade for me.

With an array of predictable and tiresome `chimp' jokes, `Space Chimps' makes very little of a promising concept.  When a probe goes through a time warp and disappears a group of monkeys trained for space are sent up in a ship to make sure that the warp is safe for humans (if the monkeys melt or explode or combust or whatever then they know NOT to send the humans).  The only problem is that the monkeys actually think that they are astronauts, so when they get to the planet they think they are really on a mission of great importance.  Add to that the fact that the planet they land on has been hostilely taken over by a tyrant using the probe as a weapon and you have an adventure for these little primates.

It's too bad it's not interesting.

The storyline built for the alien world is clichd and mediocre, offering nothing new except a poorly developed rehashing of previous alien films.  Jeff Daniels voice work is unrecognizable and obnoxious and horrible and, well, yeah; all of that.  The creatures are boring and simple, all except Kilowatt (her scene in the cave made me chuckle a bit, even if it was a ridiculous play on emotions).  It's just a poorly made film all the way around.

It's lazy.  That's the best way to put it.  This is a lazy attempt at money.  They took a pretty neat idea and wasted it by putting zero effort into making it spectacular.  There are many, many animated films out there MUCH better than this pile of dookie.  Watch one of those.

Oh yeah, and next time, give Jane Lynch a bigger part!",1255392000,2,2161,4.431472081218274

3565824,4,B001F7Q4J8,"""Space Chimps"" is a mostly harmless animated movie aimed at pre-teens, but contains a lot of subtle adult refferences. The story line was enjoyable, the animations was good (but not outstanding), and the voice acting was fairly good.

No plot spoilers from me, the movie centers on Ham III who is the grandson of the first monkey sent into space. Ham III is selected to join a dangerous mission to investigate a missing NASA probe. Along the way there are lessons in love, loyalty, and duty.

Some of the NASA scientist refferences were very funny to me since my father, sister, and brother-in-law were/are NASA engineers. Some of the sterotyping hit a little close to home.

3565835,4,B001F7Q4J8,"Nowadays when it comes to animation, unless you're a twenty year old television show, computer generated images (CGI) is the only acceptable way of telling your story to today's masses. But unlike the loss of the human hand to draw out the emotions that now an unfeeling computer does, the story itself has to reach the audience as well. One of the main reasons CGI originator and giant Pixar was able to not only blow us away with amazing detail, but also with stories that tugged at our heartstrings. Afterwards of course companies like Dreamworks got into the act and had similiar results. But now a good 10 years into the process, alot of these modern-day ""cartoons"" lack either the vocal talent or the tale that can't live up to the outstanding images in front of them. And then there are the movies that just get lost in the shuffle, unfairly shadowed by brand names with titles like WALL*E or Shrek The Third. Space Chimps, believe it or not, was one of them.

Space Chimps is an entertaining tale produced by Starz Animation (?) and probably the guy that brought coffee on Shrek. In it, a chimp named Ham III, the great-grandson of the real life chimpanzee Ham The First who flew in the 1959 MR-2 mission, has spent most his life performing in a circus as a ""flying"" chimp aka shot out of a cannon. When a space probe sent from Earth by...well, not NASA (couldn't get the name, huh guys?) goes lost through a wormhole landing on a colorful alien planet, it becomes this space agency's new mission to send three space chimps (including for press the lost great-grandson who knows nothing of space training) in a smaller version of the space shuttle and somehow help relocate the probe. However, this probe has landed in the wrong evil hands by alien Zartog, who with the help of the probe's recorded Earth images, wants to create a Las Vegas-like palace at the expense of all the other creatures living there. While the way, Ham will learn love and concern over his fellow chimp and alien, and find his way back home.

I know it sounds predictable and corny, but somehow it works and is very entertaining without trying all that hard. But what gets main points of appeal here is the presentation of the voice actors and the heart-felt readings they give within this movie where so many others like it seem to fail lately. Heading up the cast as Ham is Andy Samberg, the young SNL star of two really funny Digital Shorts...and about 50 lame ones. Somehow his voice is perfect to play the sarcastic, jokingly Ham to a tee, and there's alot of authenticity in his reading. Same goes for the rest of the cast of some decent names like Cheryl Hines, Patrick Warburton (who is slowly becoming the Kevin Bacon Of Animation Voices), Kristin Chenoweth, Stanley Tucci, and Jeff Daniels. Each actor really puts in a great performance that keeps you into the somewhat silly story. As far as the animation goes, it's good, not WALL*E great, nor should it. To say the phrase ""less is more"" here really goes a long way. The NASA-like headquarters reflect their military-gray atmosphere while the alien worlds are extremely colorful, full of strange landscapes and creatures. But nothing is visually over-the-top here, and it looks perfect.

As for the overall appeal, I with my young daughter both found ourselves laughing and enjoying this movie on the same and different levels. I for one really appreciated all the homages to other great Sci-Fi entertainment nods within like from 2001, Star Trek, Apollo 13, Planet Of The Apes (of course), and the aliens looking alot like the ones in the 1985 kid-classic Explorers (nice touch, guys). She found all the chimp-puns funny and how they interact with both human and alien laugh inducing. So is this the next WALL*E? No it isn't, but it does prove you don't have to be one of the big guys to make an entertaining CG film. And in some aspects, the little guys still remember there's got to be a good performance and script on these films too.

Finally as for the disc itself, it's a flipper with Widescreen and Full Frame sides with just one bonus, an eight minute documentary on the actors and their voices that show they were there for more than just a paycheck. Too bad FOX (who is releasing it on DVD) didn't show it more respect than this, this film could have been appreciated by alot more kids (and adults) in the process, as well as maybe inspiring a couple of future human astronauts in the process. Defintely worth at least a rental, and probably very impressive on Blu-Ray. Don't monkey around and miss this one.

Pros:
*An entertaining story with a great script & vocal readings,
all without trying too hard to blow your mind.
*We finally found a reason for Andy Samberg to be in movies.
*It's funny for both kids and adults alike.

Cons:
*Fox should have treated (and promoted) this movie better. From the trailer did you know that the Chimps go to a weird alien planet?
*If you think all CGI movies should look as detailed and sterile as WALL*E, this movie will only strengthen your spoiled tastes.
*Pixar and Dreamworks are finally going to have to realize that they're NOT the only pony-show in town anymore to make a decent movie outta this technique.

3565836,2,B001F7Q4J8,"I had the misfortune of watching about half of this movie over Christmas. While I love animated films, (I own all the Pixar films) and usually like animated kids movies, I did not enjoy this one. The storyline was alright, but the animated characters just didn't have the right 'feel' to them. The main character, HAM-III, was too cocky and sure of himself to be likable. The voice acting is also a downgrade from the other animated films released in 2008. The movie just felt sub-par when compared to other kids flicks I've seen that last few years. Also, the animation itself is of a lesser quality; it just doesn't look polished.

If you're looking for a good animated film for your kids, check out WALL-E (or anything Pixar) or KUNG FU PANDA. They are much better films and more watchable for an adult audience. (KUNG FU PANDA made me laugh my pants off; Jack Black's voice acting is hysterical).",1230249600,2,900,4.625
