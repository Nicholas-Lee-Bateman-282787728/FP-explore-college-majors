If you are a fan of Lost in Space, you will love these episodes.  I actually went looking for these and was quite surprised when I found them.  They are a lot of fun to watch and get nostalgic.  The quality isn't very good, but it wasn't good when it was on TV.  Just sit back and enjoy.",1285372800,,422,4.2125
