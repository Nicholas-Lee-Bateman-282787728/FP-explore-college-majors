7049746,5,B00UKO5EES,"I was so stoked to come across this i read the description and thought this was it! But alas it is not English dubbed, while i am a die hard fan i would have still liked to have gotten what i thought i was ordering, they really need to update the description.  5 stars because this is still a wonderful set, you just get your reading in as well",1442448000,9,344,3.9855072463768115
7049747,5,B00UKO5EES,"Classic Anime - First saw it as Ronin Warriors on Cartoon Network - This set is in Japanese only with English Subtitles - which doesn't bother me, but if you need an English dubbed version this is not it.",1442361600,4,204,4.256410256410256
7049748,5,B00UKO5EES,First off I personally love this show I am a huge mark for it.that being said yes their is no English dub but that's fine subtitles Never hurt anyone .you get to see this great show in it's entirety What more do you want.,1439424000,4,221,4.045454545454546
7049749,5,B00UKO5EES,"First of all, I would like to say that many are correct that there is no English Dub in this version simply because this is the original >>Extended Edition<< of the show. Many episodes were chopped in the US release and as such there were entire scenes that were NEVER dubbed into English. Hence why the old single DVD release had dual sided DVDs. One side the English Ronin Warriors that I grew up with and adored while the second side the original uncut Japanese version of Samurai Troopers. I was stunned the first time I saw it that there was a whole scene where the guys introduced themselves to each other.

All that being said... YES! FINALLY A FULL BOX SET! I have the individual 10 DVD release with both English and Japanese but I am more than willing to shell out the money for the box set as this is the first anime I ever saw and what got me into being the full blow Otaku I am today!",1438560000,21,896,4.239766081871345
7049750,1,B00UKO5EES,Really disappointed right now about this collection because on Amazons description it said English dubbed and it is completely not English dubbed at all,1432166400,9,152,5.375
7049751,2,B00UKO5EES,"Be advised this box set does not contain the classic English Dub we all love, and were hoping for! Ronin Warriors is one of my all-time favorites, but this set is nothing more than a disappointing letdown! >:(",1431129600,8,209,4.526315789473684
7049752,3,B00UKO5EES,"First off, I just want to say I'm so happy this show is finally out on DVD, I remember as a child growing up this was one of my absolute favorite shows to watch. The reason I am only giving this three stars however, is because Amazon did not disclose it was Japanese audio only. I know it now says ""Japanese audio, English subtitles,"" but at the time of the preorder (Which was only two weeks ago) that was not listed as part of the title. Even further, the product information listed there to be an English dub included (and it still says that). Obviously they have corrected one of those errors at this point, but for someone who has never really been a fan of subtitles, this is a huge disappointment. From now on I will be waiting until the release date before purchasing anything else off Amazon because their descriptions simply aren't trustworthy.",1430265600,10,854,4.516129032258065
7049753,5,B00UKO5EES,"I am happy that this finally gets its official release in its entirety.  I have this collection as well as the comic con bootleg version and can say that the differences are very noticeable right off the bat.
The quality on this version is crisp in video as well as audio.  The opening on this series gives both Japanese option and that of the American aired tv version.  Their is a real menu and the set is official with holders for all the disks.
As for the series itself, it ranks in my top 10 favorite ever! Very nostalgic and heart warming, really. The story is cool and the action is constant and dark.  Great characters and they all get time in the light, unlike the OVA series which placed the main focus on Ryo. (lol) If your slightly interested, get it! Its worth the 40 dollars",1430179200,11,788,4.340136054421769

7049768,1,B00UKO5EES,"This probably deserves a higher than 1 star review, but I am rating it as one star because the description is wrong.  I purchased this because it says it is dubbed in English - it has no English dub available.  The audio is only in Japanese.  Fix the description and I will remove this review.",1473206400,4,293,4.290909090909091
7049769,5,B00UKO5EES,Excellent..and truly a Must Own if your a True ANIME-FAN Collector!!!,1472688000,3,69,5.363636363636363
7049770,1,B00UKO5EES,Not in English dub but in English sub and need to change the description of this item,1470873600,4,85,4.0588235294117645
7049771,1,B00UKO5EES,I am NOT giving this a bad review based on the show. The Anime rocks! The low score is based on false advertisement by the seller. This DVD set is NOT English dubbed. Luckily I can read English. Still it sucked to be deceived. If that wasn't the issue this would have been a 5-star review.,1461283200,4,289,4.178571428571429
7049772,4,B00UKO5EES,After having missed the final eps when it aired in the early 90s I didn't think I'd see it again. Now thankfully I'm able to complete the story. As soon as it arrived I tore through the package and quickly put into my DVD player to watch. As the options appeared I noticed that there wasn't an option for an English dubbed. I'm a little sad about that cause I enjoyed the English dubbed. But nonetheless it's still a great series and well deserved place in any anime fans collection,1460160000,2,482,4.366666666666666
7049773,5,B00UKO5EES,Very pleased,1456876800,2,12,5.5
7049774,1,B00UKO5EES,"I don't understand Discotek, on one hand they're doing us a big favor by rescuing licenses long expired. On the other hand they're sitting on a gold mine but refuse to do anything about it! What people want are not half-assed rushed releases, after all we waited long enough. If your going to break the mold, do it right first time like you did with Fist of the North Star! I find it inexcusable for this release not to include the dub. Bandai had the dub. The OVA had the dub. So what's the point of releasing this without the dub? Trying to get people to double/triple dip? Even if they had licensing issues, they should've resolved it before this release. Who knows, the search for answers continues. Other missed opportunities such as the complete Saint Seiya Sanctuary release, this could be sub only since the dub was never completed (like FOTNS). Also Dr. Slump remake '97, All 3 Devilman OVA on one dvd (including Amon: The Apocalypse), Captain Tsubasa series, these are all golden missed opportunities. Instead they're releasing crap that are still easily obtained (Fatal Fury, Vampire D, Getter Robo Armageddon, Jin Roh, Castle of Cagliostro and more), I guess they have too much money to spare.",1446336000,,1205,4.770334928229665
7049775,4,B00UKO5EES,"I accidentally thought that this would have both the Japanese and English audio, and was a little sad to see that it only had the Japanese audio. However, I only saw the English version growing up and was presently surprised with original version. I am also a huge fan of the show and am happy to have this in my collection.",1444176000,3,324,4.327868852459017
7049776,1,B00UKO5EES,I ended up returning it because it did not have the English and Japanese dubs that the description had originally given.,1442534400,4,120,4.761904761904762

8707245,5,B00UKO5EES,"This is legit the version I wanted to see after seeing the dubbed version. There's no editing, no name changes, just English subs for you to understand what's going on. The video quality is great and it's a superb purchase for those who are fans of the series; I wish they would do an HD remaster of this show.",1522713600,,310,4.271186440677966

8707249,3,B00UKO5EES,I loved this series growing up and was super excited to see that it was available on DVD. I read the product description and was even more excited when I saw that it stated it was dubbed because I wanted to share this with my kids as a lot of the new cartoons on tv suck. Imagine my disappointment when it arrives and I find out it isn't dubbed as stated and only subtitled. If it wasn't for that I would have given this 5 stars.,1491004800,2,429,4.0
8707250,5,B00UKO5EES,Wonderful to have this show back in my life. There are a few moments where you get a weird screen glitch but otherwise very smooth with wonderful sound.,1490832000,,152,4.464285714285714
8707251,4,B00UKO5EES,Another great DVD set from Discotek!,1489363200,2,36,5.166666666666667
8707252,4,B00UKO5EES,Wish it was in English,1483488000,2,22,3.6
8707253,5,B00UKO5EES,"If you only want to watch this classic dubbed in English,  I can't stop you. But the original Japanese  subtitled is way  better (I used to watch this on toonami as a child,  trust me,  the dub is really bad!)  Not only did the dub change names from the original script,  there was more than that butchered just to suit an American audience. Plus, the story line  is  better  explained  in  the  original.  I am MORE than happy this anime finally gets a complete collection!  All I could find for the longest time we're either single flip-side dvd's with both dub and sub,  and even found an import but it was only in dub  to  my  disappointment. Thank you for making this a thing!!!",1483401600,4,683,4.362903225806452
