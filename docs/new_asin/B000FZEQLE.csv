8127735,5,B000FZEQLE,"I recently discovered these ""Pokemon 10th Anniversary"" DVD's.

All three of our children absolutely love Pokemon. Their ages/genders are 8 boy, 4 girl, and 3 girl.

I really try to buy them other things besides toys because they have so many toys. So books and DVDs are my go to when it comes to birthdays, Christmas and Easter.

They were SO excited to open these on their birthday. My 8 and 3 year olds have a birthday a week apart so I bought several of these DVD's for them. I love the cover art on this DVD and it's neat that they have DVD's for many of the characters because our kids do have their favorite Pokemon characters. Squirtle is one of our 3 yr olds favorite characters.

I think these DVD's come at a great price as well. I will definitely be buying more especially with Christmas coming up soon.",1475884800,,814,4.370860927152318
