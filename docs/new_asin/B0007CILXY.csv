The only and I mean only good thing about this movie is that Mentone,AL is a real place and is very beautiful so there are many good shots in the movie of this town.  My theory is obviously these two ladies could not find jobs due to may I say, lack of talent.  So they begged for money and made a movie they could be the stars in.  This is suppose to be a Christian movie but they must have forgotten one of the Seven deadly sins....vanity!  Don't quite your day job!!!!",1119830400,,621,4.184873949579832

8046741,5,B0007CILXY,"I think this movie is amazing especially a low budget,the characters were fun, the story was great, the scenery is as one of the characters says: ""gods canvas"",there was no cussing or sex, this is a movie christian or not that you could fall in love with its southern charm, and happily watch again.",1368835200,,299,4.555555555555555
8046742,5,B0007CILXY,This was so enjoyable. A movie without cussing and sex. It is a well made movie with a great story and beautiful scenery.,1356998400,,121,4.304347826086956
8046743,5,B0007CILXY,Loved the movie. Great theme. I have told several people. I had the vhs version but it has worn out over the years.,1354924800,,115,4.043478260869565
8046744,5,B0007CILXY,"This movie may be a bit cheesy but it is still cute.  It was filmed in my hometown and I was able to watch part of it being filmed.  I have lots of friends who were extras in the film and I have personally visited many places in the film.  In face, I worked just around the corner from one of the shots and watched it being filmed.",1351468800,,331,3.838235294117647
8046745,4,B0007CILXY,"There is a clean family film.  Sure, it is lower budget and doesn't have all the elements that some may desire in a normal Hollywood flick, but it is refreshing to be able to turn this on without worrying about content.  Fun with a good message.  Some of the characters are pretty bad, but just enjoy the film as a whole.",1324512000,,321,4.229508196721311
8046746,4,B0007CILXY,"I thought I would try and enlighten a few people about this movie. No it is not a blockbuster, but when was the last time you saw a ""G"" rated ADULT movie?  20 years or more maybe? These two wonderful ladies wrote a screenplay and tried to get one of the bigger film companies to film it. But the only way was if they signed their rights away and let them put cursing and sex and so on into it and film it in some far off location. The writers refused to give up those rights. It would have been better with a larger filming budget. I know of one famous New York Times Best Seller in books that has refused to let Hollywood get a hold of his books because of what they have done with his previous books. I was working as an assistant manager of a movie theater when we got this movie. We had to change it to a bigger auditorium because it was drawing bigger groups of people. One thing I noticed about this film is the COLOR.  I haven't seen a movie in many years that has the pretty vibrant color that is in this film and with perfect focus.  Yes it was shot local to where I live and I have seen the real location but in the film the colors just stand out! By the way they did not beg for money to get this movie made.  One of the characters in the movie is obnotious, as acting like a back woods Elvis. And yes it shows some over the bar country voices, but if you can look past that, then open your mind to the story and scenery, you will understand why some people loved the movie. If you have any intelligence and heart, you will have a warm hearted fuzzy feeling after watching it.  At least Hollywood didn't get their hands on it and ruin the story. Also the writers starred in the movie and one was pregnant and the other sick, but that didn't stop them from filming it.  More movies should be made like this. It is worth watching at least once or twice and I am glad I have it in my collection.",1275609600,4,1903,4.047872340425532
8046747,3,B0007CILXY,"If you are a true Peter Deluise fan you will love this movie...this movie has no bad language, sex, or violence. That is what makes this a good movie.. This is truely a family film full of southern charm. I enjoyed the movie very much. The scenery and location where this film was made is just beautiful..this is a rare and special movie. I think Peter Deluise did an excellent job staring in this movie and directing it.",1188432000,8,421,4.410256410256411
8046748,1,B0007CILXY,"Hal Warren, the El Paso, TX fertilizer salesman who made the movie ""Manos:  The Hands of Fate"", must have been looking on from his perch in the hereafter, praying that ""Southern Heart"" would be just a little bit worse than it turned out to be.  Had his prayers been answered, ""Manos"" might have no longer been considered by many the worst movie ever made.  But even ""Manos"" manages to entertain by its nosedive beneath mediocrity.  ""Southern Heart"" doesn't even accomplish that.  If you want scenery, ""Southern Heart"" has it.  If you want a creatively scripted, finely tuned, masterfully crafted, well acted motion picture, do not look to ""Southern Heart"".  The near backwoods hillbilly nature of the periferal characters is more than hackneyed; in fact, it would have to improve to achieve cliche status.  And the main characters fail to make us care.  We know where they are going, but they offer no engaging means of taking us along.  Making a good movie requires everything ""Southern Heart"" lacks.  When next you wish just to watch a terrible movie, pop in ""Manos""; but steer clear of ""Southern Heart"".  Who knows?  Perhaps ""Southern Heart"" actually is the worst movie ever made.",1146787200,,1183,4.914141414141414
