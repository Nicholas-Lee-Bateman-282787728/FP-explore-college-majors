7799030,1,1577421485,"I as well, bought this film expecting to see an actual movie with certain actors but instead it was a documentary. I think Amazon & many others need to be more clear and provide information detail how this film is a documentary ONLY! That the other River of Stone film with such actors as Philip Michael Thomas is unavailable because obviously it is!",1424217600,,350,4.571428571428571
7799031,1,1577421485,There are 2 River of Stones... One is a documentary with Robert Redford and the second is a movie with James Doohan.  I was hoping to find the movie with James Doohan here but all I find is the documentary.  Amazon is confusing the two.  I can't seem to find the movie anywhere.  The Internet Movie Database is also confused.  They have the cover for the documentary with the info for the movie as well.,1176854400,2,403,4.32
7799032,2,1577421485,"Somebody is confused. ""River of Stone: The Powell Expedition"" is actually a documentary narrated and directed by Robert Redford. James Doohan is nowhere to be seen, nor any of the other credited actors. Mildly interesting, if you like shots of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River.",1174435200,4,284,5.0638297872340425
