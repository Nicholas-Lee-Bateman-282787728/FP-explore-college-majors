2155977,5,B0003JAO8Q,"There are so many good things I could say about this movie. It's almost hard to know where to begin.

At first, you get the impression that Sue Tom (The Mom and ""a woman of a certain weight""), is so desperate for companionship that she creates her own brood by adopting special needs children. But not 15 minutes into the documentary you realize, this woman was *born* to be a Mom and is a gifted, patient, hyper-intelligent and compassionate soul.

Then you realize how blessed these children are to have found someone willing and able to not only be their mom, but to love them unconditionally and raise them to be happy, mentally-healthy and perspicacious adults.

And then there's the issue of the children. The first time I saw ""Faith"" (the little girl who was so badly burned) appear on screen, I had to close my eyes. Her physical appearance was very severe. But before the movie was half over, I found myself falling in love with this precious and precocious little girl. She's got a sweet nature and a wisdom that belies her age. Close your eyes and listen to her voice and you'll hear an angelic voice laced with a tenderness and thoughtfulness that is soul-stirring.

And the ending is stunning. I'm still thinking about the ending.

This documentary has changed the way I view the world and view others and think about myself. If I were queen of the world I'd sit everyone down one Sunday night and make them all (all six billion of us small-minded earthlings) watch this movie.",1132185600,10,1490,4.628787878787879
2155978,5,B0003JAO8Q,"This compelling, heart-breaking documentary shows a lonely single mother who adopts more and more children with special needs and lives in a constant state of being overwhelmed. The film asks the question: At what point does giving become a need that reaches a point of no return. For example, the mother's biological daughter cries in anguish when she realizes her life is about helping her mother care for the adopted children while her own needs are left ignored. The film offers no easy answers. Nor does the film paint the mother in a simple light. She is a complex woman full of complex motivations for adopting more than a dozen children. The filmaker is sympathetic and offers no judgments. He simply allows us to struggle with making our own conclusions. The children are presented in a noncondescending light. They are loveable survivors. One twelve-year-old boy however is severely angry, largely in part because his biological mother abandoned him when his health problems became too difficult, and he shows that he is a danger to the other children. He talks freely about wanting to kill them. His anger combined with his need to be loved puts the mother and the rest of the family in their biggest dilemma and is a major focus of this excellent documentary about a family that out of their daily crises grow a profound love for each other.",1122768000,21,1353,4.836206896551724
2155979,5,B0003JAO8Q,"Being a resident of Fairfield, it's a small enough world that I actually ended up working with one of the Tom kids!  The now adult Margaret is still extremely headstrong independent and amazing.  She has a strong work ethic and a zest for life unlike some people I've seen in our town.  The film only briefly shows her and at the same time, she is absolutely touching...her struggles with ""not doing enough"" and all must have been hell for her.  I respected her before I viewed to picture and now even more I respect her for staying strong in such a huge family.  Meeting all the kids is an amazing experience too!  Their mom is very humble, and even at my comment of ""I just have to say you are AWESOME"" she quietly said Thanks, and i brought them their food.  She really is remarkable...The family is remarkable, such honest special people.

The film is nicely shot in digital video.  The family unit is shown and while dysfuntional is very much an all american family, with issues and hard times.  It is a definite break from the normal ""hollywood"" family. You don't see everyone smiling and acting like lifes just a breeze.  It's a beautiful emotional film with a heart and a great entertaining learned feel to it.  It is even better if you meet these remarkable individuals.  They really are beautiful people.",1120867200,8,1314,4.587982832618025
2155980,4,B0003JAO8Q,"You, too, might be wondering (as I did): Is the story of a dedicated woman with an open heart who adopts children no one else will consider? Or is this the story of a very dysfunctional family, including one very disturbed child, one who  simply can not be saved? Or would he have been better off in a different family?

  This movie was both riveting and painful to watch and it was hard NOT to judge the adults in the movie: parents who abandoned their children, showing up for sporadic visits which only caused more pain to their children, emotional ups and downs, tensions and outright breakdowns. And yet, through it all, there was a spirit of resiliance, of hope and of getting a rare glimpse into a real family, with all its flaws and chipped edges.",1114128000,2,756,4.4963503649635035
2155981,5,B0003JAO8Q,"I just happened to see this DVD is passing at my local Best Buy.  I read the back and then put it back down and then saw it again and thought, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  Now, I can't tell people enough about it.  No matter what you have going on in your life, watch this movie.  It puts everything into a whole new perspective.  WOW.....the ending was stunning, never did I imagine the way it ends.",1106006400,7,407,4.0375
2155982,5,B0003JAO8Q,"I have seen a variety of documentaries and could not recommend anything better. I was drawn to this film as I am training to work with children with special needs. However, I witnessed an entire room captivated by this film. Not a dry eye in the place. The emotions evoked from this film are remarkable. It provides viewers the opportunity to experience life with the Tom family--and gain a new perspective of living life to the fullest. I promise this film will leave every viewer with something special.",1103500800,7,505,4.75
2155983,5,B0003JAO8Q,"I am an avid documentary viewer and this is by far the MOST moving documentary I have ever seen.  The filmmaker was given one year (no more, no less) to record the events of a most extraordinary family.  Susan Tom is a single mother who takes care of her own biological and adopted children.  Most of the children have a variety of special needs and Susan's strength, intelligence, humor, kindness, empathy, tenacity and flexibility allows her to give each child the attention and parenting they all need and deserve.  The family is alarmingly honest and each person in the film moves through an epic struggle.  We are so privileged to watch.  The family loves, fights, support.  Within the year's framework, the filmmaker catches heartbreaking and painful moments.  There are also many joyous moments.  The film stays  with the viewer- dare I say- forever.  I am a parent of a autistic son, and I have often felt alone in my struggle to make life the best it can be for him.  The world can easily judge, can easily misunderstand.  Without my advocacy I know my son would not be as secure and happy as he is today.  In Susan Tom, I have found a personal hero- a woman who is beautiful and intelligent and a master at her job.  Thank you to the whole Tom family (and to the filmmakers) for giving the world a glimpse.  I wish you all the best.  You touched us so deeply- Joe, Anthony etc.
PS. My daughter and I cried deeply- make sure to have kleenex handy when viewing.  Film's official website:

2155985,5,B0003JAO8Q,"Charity personified. An unforgetable portrait of courage and sacrifice on the part of the mom, and of courage and tenacity in the children. This movie speaks to the meaning of life (which is never seen in modern media).",1183939200,3,219,4.7894736842105265
2155986,4,B0003JAO8Q,"Susan Tom is a divorced, single mother in California who after having two biological children adopted eleven handicapped children. This emotionally intense documentary film is not about a smiley Brady Bunch, but about a raucous household of children with serious and severe problems--mental, physical, emotional and medical. Faith was horribly disfigured in a fire as an infant. Xenia was born with no legs. Teenager Joe is a deeply angry and explosive child who threatens to kill Xenia; he eventually dies from Cystic Fibrosis. Others are mentally retarded. Susan describes herself as ""fat but interesting."" Both adjectives understate the case. She does not work outside the home, but instead supports everyone, and her $600 a week grocery bill, from SSI income. Margaret, age 18, is unwillingly conscripted to help make it all work, and breaks down in screams to get her mother's attention. Perhaps the mark of a fine film is that in watching it you think far more about its subjects than about how they are portrayed. My Flesh and Blood won the Audience Documentary Award at the 2003 Sundance festival.",1169596800,2,1105,5.110497237569061
2155987,5,B0003JAO8Q,"One of the best documentaries I have ever seen. A family composed of a mother and thirteen children, eleven of them adopted, is followed for a year of their lives in such a way that each child can be appreciated as an individual, without disabilities or other special needs overshadowing the person.

2155989,3,B0003JAO8Q,"This is an interesting and worthwhile movie, but it's incomplete. Margaret was left hanging at the end as we're left to wonder about her and her situation which makes the movie somewhat of a disappointment. One can't help but be a little skeptical about Susan's dedication to all her children when she so abruptly brushes Margaret off at a point when she's so obviously in need of some crucial emotional support. The extras give us a cursory explanation of this by the director, but Ben's comments lend insight of another sort.

The director dropped the ball by not following up on Margaret.",1167436800,6,591,4.794117647058823
2155990,5,B0003JAO8Q,"This 'film' captures the life of a mother and her flock of wonderful adopted challenged children in all its daily grist and glory. This is a story about many kids, including Joe, a young boy trapped in his anger who takes the world down with him -  - it is the story of two beautiful smart girls without legs and their struggle to find acceptance among their peers -  - This is a story about a young boy whose skin becomes unglued from his body and about a very special young girl (burn injury) named Faith and their valiant quest for love and life  - It is the story of their adoptee mother - who isn't perfect though she takes on a task few people would dare - This is a shining testimony to the strength and resolve within some people to conquer and rise above their challenges. It is a story about young Joe, who, unfortunately, dies trying. It's about children who don't mope and whine but buckle in and fight life to its fullest.  Highly recommended!  If you care for people this movie will move you to re-examine your priorities. If you don't care about people, this might be a good starting point for you to make a change.  Above all, no matter who you are, this is a movie WORTH WATCHING!",1157673600,2,1197,4.321428571428571
2155991,5,B0003JAO8Q,"How does one review a movie he or she saw through misty eyes?  The handicaps these children have, to me, seem unimaginable.  Yes, it hurts anyone who loves kids to see a single one suffering, but that isn't what gives one the misty eyes in this movie.  In spite of their horrific injuries, birth defects or diseases, you see them here clearly as children.  They have the same innocence, the same hopes for life and for love, and they are able to care about the other children who seem to suffer more than them.  Wow!

One cannot forget the selflessness of these kid's adoptive mother and her older birth daughter.  They have to be a team of saints.

For me, this isn't a documentary to look at and say, ""Well, that's nice of them.  I feel sorry for the children.""  I think this is a movie that parents can, and should, show their school-age children as long as they can give their children any assurances they need.  [""Yes, you could get burnt like the little girl in this movie, but you'd be more likely to get hit by a car on the way to school and you do that every day without worry.""]

Children are likely, however, to run into a schoolmate with some similar physical problem.  By watching this movie with them, parents have a wonderful opportunity to point out how lovingly the mother and sister treated these kids and to discuss with their children how they could be loving to handicapped or scarred kids they might meet.  This would be a safe way to help kids determine to overlook the deformities to look into the hearts of sick, scared or handicapped kids.  Could your child look at a little eight-year-old girl, burned beyond belief as a helpless baby, and also see her as the pretty girl she looks forward to becoming?  Pretty inside?",1155168000,2,1745,4.492063492063492
2155992,5,B0003JAO8Q,"This is a documentary you will want to see more than once, as it is a remarkable story of an extraordinary family. The decision Susan Tom has made to adopt so many children is astounding, and she deserves a lot of respect, even tough she is not portrayed (or wants to be portrayed) as an angel or saint. We (as viewers) see that there is normality within that ""abnormality"", as the household have to deal with the same everyday stuff all families deal with (on top of the specific (medical) problems relating to the various members of the Tom family). I must admit my heart broke a couple of times during the movie and I will never forget this family.

Overall the film should have been longer as it jumped too much for my taste, however the love and compassion in the family shows.

8035972,4,B0003JAO8Q,"I'm struggling to find the same enthusiasm for the movie as others have. I just watched it last night and while I found it a moving documentary, I wasn't very satisfied with it as a finished piece. I felt so much awe for Susan Tom. I don't understand all of her parenting decisions, but you can certainly tell that she's a good woman, a strong woman, and that she's motivated by love.

The children the documentary allowed us to see were mostly amazing. She has formed a strong family in which the children seem very secure, whatever their personal issues and feelings about their environment.

The reason I'm not as enthusiastic about this film as others have been is that it felt like a first edit of what could have been a very informative and moving documentary. She had 10 children left at home, one of whom was older and helped to care for the remaining 9. We only got to know the older daughter and 4 of the younger ones. I was left wondering about the children that were not introduced and were only seen in the background or in the music-tracked scenes. Their names were mentioned as Susan described the order in which they came into her life, but little/no information was given about them.

Of the four children ""featured"" in the film, background was given about 2, and the other two were shown frequently but their past was a complete mystery. Why did Anthony's family (an affluent-looking, well dressed, large and very loving-seeming family) give him up? Because he had a disease? They showed up to his 20th birthday party and that was a bit of a shock as they were not mentioned before this, and Anthony himself looked a bit bewildered to be in the midst of them. That's just a single example of the large amount of missing information - I found it hard to really get a picture of Susan and her family when such detail was focused on one child and very, very little information on the others. It felt incomplete.",1325721600,2,1926,4.528735632183908
8035973,4,B0003JAO8Q,It's a good movie but it is sad.  I'd watch it more than once.  It was good enough I bought one for a birthday gift.  My mother watched it 5 times.  So I had to buy myself one.,1314403200,,176,3.5526315789473686
8035974,1,B0003JAO8Q,"I felt very skeptical about Susan Tom's ability as a mother and both my husband and I wondered about her motives. Each of those children needed a huge amount of individual care - in that household, nobody could have really gotten what they needed. I felt most sad of all about Margaret. It seemed to us that Susan was using her as an unpaid nanny/nurse/housekeeper and when she tried to express her anger about her own needs being buried, Susan basically shut her up in a very disturbing way. We felt certain that was because Susan didn't want Margaret's perceptive grievances filmed and any real criticisms to come out - it felt very abusive actually. What others said about the reasons to us did not make sense - Susan's reaction had very little to do with protecting Margaret's privacy. Adoption is such an enormous undertaking and requires such sensitivity - children have to feel that they are really loved and understood and have to be allowed to grieve their enormous losses - and that grieving continues throughout their life. You do not adopt in order to use someone to help you get the laundry done or give medicine to other children. Margaret must have felt utterly alone - she seem to be someone brow beaten enough to believe that her own issues were not large enough to justify complaint in comparison with children with physical disabilities. She seemed to be on the cusp of rebelling in the film - helped by a counsellor - yet that was silenced. Yet making sense of what happened to her - the loss of her birth parents (which was never covered), her full time employment caring for the other children, the loss of any connection to her culture - there was no space for any of that for her. How could social services allow Susan to take in all of these children who - each on their own- required so much attention and careful care? We asked that again and again while watching. The chaos and the unexamined anger in several of the children felt very wrong. It may sound cynical, but we both felt that the huge financial benefits (which were played down but which we know are considerable) together with Susan's own need to be needed (itself stemming from her own undemonstrative mother - who magically appeared after six years just as the cameras were rolling) had alot to do with her choice to take in so many children with such severe needs. And Susan clearly had serious body image issues - it came up several times - one wonders, sadly, if her choice of adoptees was linked in some way to this. It is not at all far-fetched to imagine it - people have very disturbing reactions to unhappiness with how they look. As for Joe, he was the other child that we really felt for. He needed a whole raft of care and understanding - he needed a mother and a father (he desperately needed a stable male relationship) all to himself. He had been abandoned so often and there were clearly genetic issues with anger and self control. And on top, his illness. So many issues that needed expert, tender understanding and patience. Existing in the chaos of that family with a mother who could not have had enough time for him and who we believe was (Margaret was right and perceptive) relieved when he died, was simply wrong for him. The whole set up seemed to us like an orphanage or a foster care situation - and it was not what these children needed. It may well have been exactly what Susan Tom needed to make sense of her life and to deal with her own issues. But this film should have been about the children and the filmmakers should have asked harder questions. We would like to know what happened to Margaret - the silenced child.",1306713600,5,3641,4.526555386949924
8035975,5,B0003JAO8Q,"My Flesh And Blood is an outstanding documentary that showcases one year in the lives of a woman and her adopted disabled children. Their life stories are told to varying degrees while the focus remains on the events that naturally occur over twelve months. We witness great suffering, hope, pain, joy, happiness, creativity, love and a deep drive on the part of everyone to keep on living, even if it's only one day at a time, in order to stay alive and enjoy the best quality of life possible while they're here on this Earth.

The household is essentially run by a woman who has a heart of gold, Susan Tom. Despite the fact that her marriage didn't work out she adopted one more child after another until she had about eleven adopted kids in her home with varying degrees of different types of disabilities. Unlike some other reviewers, my heart went out the most to Joe Tom, who suffers from both cystic fibrosis and emotional problems. Joe lashes out verbally at other kids in the home because he was never loved the right way to begin with; and his birth mother isn't much of a help even when she thinks she is being helpful.  Joe threatens to hurt or even kill other kids in the household but he stops (at least) at verbal abuse; I have the feeling that if he had been treated with the proper therapist a lot of his emotional problems could have been greatly improved. In addition, I also felt a great deal of admiration for a young girl who has no legs; we see her happily enjoying life, swimming and even doing her own form of jumping rope using sneakers on her hands for balance! There's also the very touching and emotional portrait of a young man who has a rare genetic disorder that makes the skin less adhesive to the body; I couldn't believe how brave he was! Susan Tom lovingly gives him a bath four times each week--and that takes roughly three hours each time because his skin condition is so bad that she must go very slowly with the bath so as not to hurt him too badly. Wow!

We also see Susan as a human being--with flaws as well as her strengths. Naturally, she is an inspiration to us all in that she has the patience to deal with all these children and she cares for them really rather well overall. That is, overall. We see how eventually Susan's own daughter breaks down in tears because Susan is so busy taking care of the adopted children that she doesn't have time for her own daughter! I thought Susan could have handled this better; she essentially tells her daughter that they'll schedule a time to talk about it the following morning. Susan just doesn't have the time to go into it right now. Gee, if Susan doesn't have time for her own daughter, can she truly sleep well at night? I suppose the answer is that she can; Susan believes that she IS doing the best that she can do under the circumstances; and there's certainly truth to that.

The DVD comes with deleted scenes, follow-up interviews, and an interview with Susan's eldest sons in addition to other bonus features.

My Flesh And Blood tells the remarkable story of a woman who loves children and taking care of others so much that she goes well beyond the call of duty to help as many disabled children as best she can regardless of the problems they have. I highly recommend this documentary, while Susan Tom isn't perfect (she's human, after all), she  cares the way we all should care; and that's what makes this film an important example of just how much love can do to improve the lives of those of us who are less fortunate.",1245369600,6,3526,4.458914728682171
8035976,5,B0003JAO8Q,I am thankful for people like those featured in My Flesh and Blood and for those that give us the opportunity to learn about them in films like this.  She doesn't consider herself supermom but what she does is heroic and wonderful.,1240876800,2,231,4.5
