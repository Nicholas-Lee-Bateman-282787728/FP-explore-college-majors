2165241,2,B000641ZV8,"I liked this movie right up until the unwanted intrusion of two unreasonably dumb cops (Frank McHugh as Clancy and Allen Jenkins as Dugan).  What started as a solid mystery soon collapsed under the weight of forced humor thanks to this pair of nitwits.  These brazenly incompetent boobs are two of the most obnoxious characters ever foisted upon the cinema.  What passes for humor is a patter of long forgotten slang recited too quickly to be funny, even if it could be understood.  This pair of obscenely stupid cops dominate every scene they're in and not in a good way.  Their boisterous antics are repetitious and tedious, breaking up the natural flow of the story.  While everyone else is playing it straightforward, they're clowning around barking orders that don't make sense, grilling `suspects' who weren't even at the scene of the crime(s).  Because somehow that's supposed to be hilarious.

As for the mystery, there's a crazed killer stabbing victims and leaving the ace of spades as his calling card at every scene of the crime.  An author (Chester Morris as Neil Broderick) is trying to solve the murders and gain a story at the same time.

I enjoyed everything except the shtick with the two idiot cops.  Can't see ever wanting to watch it again.",1431734400,3,1261,4.818604651162791
2165242,4,B000641ZV8,"A very entertaining and fun murder mystery with a great cast.  The video/audio is good.  However, there is a fair amount of hiss.  There is hiss during dialogue but none when there is no dialogue or other sounds.  I found that strange and somewhat distracting.  About 22-23 minutes into the film there is a splice with missing dialogue.  The print is a re-release as evidenced by the re-done title card.  The film was originally distributed by RKO and all references to them have been removed.  No Alpha logo(on releases before 2005).",1427587200,2,534,4.791208791208791
2165243,3,B000641ZV8,I always enjoy watching the old 1930's-40's mystery and gangster movies.  Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins always bring plenty of humor into these films. Only gripe I have is the quality of this DVD. Too bad it wasn't cleaned up/remastered.,1408665600,,238,4.95
2165244,3,B000641ZV8,but I had already had a copy under a different title called the black ace. dissappointing to say the least,1395964800,,106,4.35
2165245,5,B000641ZV8,"Loved Chester Morris as Boston Blackie and now have just discovered him in these other movies! Am watching them on my tablet at the gym while doing cardio. Now I am adding them to our collection at home so we can watch them anytime, it is better than what's on tv! Love the feel of the old movies, the fast humor, they were true masters of suspense.",1375920000,5,349,4.223880597014926
2165246,2,B000641ZV8,"Not Boston Blackie, it came up when I was searching for Blackie.  This isn't very good and I don't recommend it.",1357171200,,112,4.333333333333333
2165247,3,B000641ZV8,"Chester Morris, Grant Mitchell, Henry Stephenson, Frank McHugh, Allen Jenkins and a number of other players who adorned both programmers and feature films over the next twenty years, take us through a creaky plot, used often for B films, such as Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, and the like, as well as 'A' features for Milton Berle, Bob Hope, Red Skelton, Abbott and Costello, and many others, A criminal has been terrorizing the country with murders, which are announced in advance and, when, invariably, successfully carried out, are tagged with a playing card. Chester Morris, a writer of mysteries, comes into town to seek  materials for his latest book. McHugh and Jenkins, two Chicago 'Flatfeet' join the group when Stevenson, an expert crusader against the Killer, is threatened. From that point on, murder takes a hand.
Vivienne Osborne is the woman in the case; she had a long and admirable career ahead, mostly on Broadway, but is simply part of the scenery in this picture.
The film is early talkie crude, the humor about the level of Abbott and Costello, nevertheless, it is amusing and never takes its murders too seriously. Historians of the film and those who have the benighted taste for programmers (as do I) will likely get some fun out of it.",1347062400,3,1254,4.859813084112149
2165248,4,B000641ZV8,"This has enough intrigue and suspense for a nice quiet evening when you are in the mood for a low budget who done it. I found this movie to be paced really well & when you are in the mood to watch this sort of movie this won't disappoint. Curl up in bed , relax and enjoy. The DVD transfer from Alpha is average to okay, basically the usual, they just get it on DVD and no remastering. I do wish some other company would put out some better quality print. Tomorrow at Seven stars Chester Morris(from The Bat Whispers,Alibi, The She Creature as well as Boston Blackie) who is tracking the Black Ace, who leaves an Ace of Spades after he kills people. Pretty good who-done-it for its kind. Other good Alpha mysteries to check out Murder at Dawn, Midnight Warning, & House of Secrets",1234051200,13,780,4.3493150684931505
2165249,4,B000641ZV8,I love Chester Morris.  This is a great mystery movie with lots of twists.  Some may remember Chester Morris in all of the Boston Blackie movies.  Chester Morris is in a more serious role in this movie rather than a light hearted comedic part as in the Boston Blackie movies.,1198195200,21,275,4.46
8038067,3,B000641ZV8,"This could have been a good B movie mystery but there are a couple of things which spoil it.  One is the ""comic relief"" provided by two bumbling Chicago police detectives who come complete with comic, Keystone Cop, oversize star badges pinned under their coats.  When they first appear, one announces his name and says he is "" from headquarters"", the second gives his name and says, ""same address.""  I wanted to yell, "" Headquarters of what? "" but the movie characters just accept this and worse.  I would have thrown them out of my house.

Some plot details follow.  Why did the detective working with Chester Morris pretend to be the coroner?  What happened to the real coroner after he later appeared?  He identified himself and disappeared from the movie.  These are just some of the nagging problems which keep this movie from more than three stars.",1496016000,,854,4.716216216216216
8038068,4,B000641ZV8,"One of the better mysteries from the 1930's era with a good plot and some real tension in the story.  I would have given this 5 Stars if it weren't for the really annoying inept police officers.  One of these is played by Allen Jenkins (who I think was in every other movie made at this time) who is usually a very likeable character actor but not in this film.  The audio is a little scratchy but other than that, a very decent transfer to DVD.  Try to ignore the police officer characters and enjoy this fine mystery!",1487376000,,519,4.26530612244898
8038069,3,B000641ZV8,Love the old B movies.,1485475200,,22,3.6
8038070,4,B000641ZV8,"I love the old b&w mysteries and this is a good one. Kind of heavy on the ""comic relief"" but a better plot than most of these kind of movies.",1481846400,,141,3.7333333333333334
8038071,4,B000641ZV8,Oldie but goodie,1477094400,,16,4.666666666666667
8038072,4,B000641ZV8,"The old films, even the ""B"" movies, almost always have more plot and real acting than the new ones, though they aren't for those who relish lots of explosions and skin.",1477008000,,168,4.451612903225806
8038073,4,B000641ZV8,This was fun.,1475020800,,13,3.6666666666666665

8038075,5,B000641ZV8,"This is one of the best movies that I've seen in recent weeks (and I often watch 2 to 3+ movies per day!) and it will stay with you for a long while. The plot is simple but at the same time is very complex and the movie is never boring and is very well-paced. This mystery will have you stumped until the end, and shocked when you discover the identity of the killer!",1473552000,,367,3.972972972972973
8038076,2,B000641ZV8,"Mine was a DVD-R, so blurry it's like watching it with my glasses off. But whatever, it's a good old dark house comedy, though McHugh and Jenkins are supposedly sharp detectives they sure get stupid fast once they're down in Florida, which might annoy you - just focus on their zippy slang-filled pre-code dialogue about gold dust (cocaine) and impeccable comediacal timing.",1434412800,,374,5.048387096774194
