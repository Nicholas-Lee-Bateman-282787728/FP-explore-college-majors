It's not a movie, it's a drama about 3 siblings who's parents were murdered. It shows this at the beginning and then it does a 14 year time skip.",1511308800,2,305,4.275862068965517

Some people have mental powers. Dead people rising. A village is punish for its sins. BAD story, BAD directing, BAD acting. BAD movie. I repeat NO METEOR. Service however was good. DVD got here fast. DVD in good condition.",1365984000,,383,4.731343283582089
