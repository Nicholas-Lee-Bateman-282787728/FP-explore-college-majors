3544072,5,B001DZOCZU,"This was a gift for my husbands birthday, he is really enjoying this series.  I received it when it was expected and in the condition(NEW) that I purchased.  As always I am a satisfied customer.  Thanks Betsy",1228089600,3,208,4.5675675675675675
3544073,4,B001DZOCZU,"If you're an owner of the previous 2 box sets and the Two Movie Fright Fest, this new package will probably disappoint. Aside from the colorized bonus feature of Family Portrait, which I would classify as acceptable not stellar, is exactly the same thing. The Menu boards are exactly the same. Season 1 has scene select, Season 2 doesn't. Plus every episode of season 2 still has that long get on your nerves UNIVERSAL STUDIOS fanfare. No you can't skip it. It'll just go to the next episode with that same fanfare. The true Munsters fan will quickly cringe at the inferior musical cues substitutes that were not corrected from the previous release. Even the episode Knock Wood, Here Comes Charlie  still has a low volume. Very little effort went into correcting the shortcomings of the previous sets. In fact, aside from the convenience of being transferred to single sided discs there was really no effort at all. Universal studios should fire their lawyers. They should have had the courage to say "" This is how the show was made. This is how the show is presented on TV and this is how we will present the dvd.  We will keep all the original musical cues intact"". I guess people with guts are becoming more scarce every day. Really, doesn't Universal have the faith that the profits of a properly made Munsters set would have more than covered the costs of monies owed to other entities that hold the rights to the music. I can understand Disney being difficult to deal with for ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" because they are a heartless company. But The Standells? Come on now! What possible power could they have that Universal was afraid to use ""Just A Little Bit"" instead of that sickening music that wasn't the Standells at all, when Eddie played them on the phonograph in the opening of Far Out Munster. Go figure. The final insult, to us the buyers, instead of using the inexpensive yet convenient thin snap covers, they created two triple fold outs that holds 2 discs per side overlapping each other. If you don't own the previous set then I recommend you get this. If you do own the previous set, don't be in too much of a hurry.  Why did I give this 4 stars? Because 80% of the set is pretty good. The 20% I gripe about is like a black hole that just sucks the good right into it. I guess even badly released Munsters is better than no Munsters at all.",1226102400,140,2366,4.510489510489511
3544074,5,B001DZOCZU,I got this for my husband's Christmas gift/2008. I always enjoyed the series and he loves it. A shame that they only made two seasons of it.,1225584000,4,140,4.222222222222222
3544075,5,B001DZOCZU,"Not only does it have the pilot color episode. Not only does it have the color version of ""Family Portrait."" Not only does it have the two wonderful color movies featuring the lovable Munster Family escapades, but here ""lies"" all, I repeat, all the black and white episodes ever aired to make your goulish belly laugh, even to this day. The jokes are surprisingly crisp, corny, whimsical, terrific, and completely without shame for the family of the undead. There is no stopping this household brim full of goodies at every corner in the spider webbed palace. Lightning strikes at any given moment, and Spot the family dragon looms in from the darkness with zeal. The episodes and movies are not without fresh ideas with many twists and turns wrapped around the Munster's familiar characteristics. Herman, is without a doubt, the funniest monster ever built, even if his doctor was a ""butter fingers."" Get this fabulous collection of funny goodies, and laugh til you die. -I mean drop.",1225411200,10,985,4.904191616766467
3544076,4,B001DZOCZU,"One of the most enjoyable horror spoofs was the TV show ""The Munsters,"" which aired originally from 1964 to 1966.  ""The Munsters: The Complete Series""  contains all 70 episodes of the show's two seasons on 12 discs.  At 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights stands a musty, cobweb-covered gothic mansion.  The residents consider themselves a normal, everyday American family, but to neighbors and viewers, they are a bit odd.  Herman (Fred Gwynne), the man of the house, is seven feet tall and looks very much like the Frankenstein monster. His wife Lily (Yvonne DeCarlo) looks like a lady vampire.  Son Eddie (Butch Patrick) is a boy/wolf, and Grandpa (Al Lewis) can pass easily for a centuries-old Count Dracula.  Daughter Marilyn, who looks strange to her family, is the only normal-looking Munster of the clan.  The comedy is very broad in these episodes, and the concept wears pretty thin after a few shows, but Gwynne is always very funny as Herman and Lewis is perfect as his vaudeville schtick melds with his vampire persona.  Extras include the two full-length Munsters movies, ""Munster, Go Home"" and ""The Munsters' Revenge,"" and career portraits of Gwynne, DeCarlo, and Lewis.",1223856000,4,1193,5.076923076923077
3544077,5,B001DZOCZU,"I received this set a bit early, and I can tell you, it is worth having if you like the ""Munsters"". I owned the two previous sets of season one and season two, but like a lot of customers I have never been happy with the two sided discs and had a few issues with them. This set has all the episodes on single-sided discs. Also, I viewed the color ""Family Portrait"" episode and loved it. I have always enjoyed the black and white look to the series as it seemed appropriate. I must admit that after seeing an episode in color, I longed to see more of them in color. Someone did their homework as the colors match color photos I have seen of the characters in costume and of the sets. My only minor complaint is that the discs are placed on top of each other. There are two holders, one each for both seasons. I would have preferred the plastic sleeves which some sets come with but these discs are grouped in twos and as I stated, with one disc partially covering up the other. The two Munster reunion movies, ""Munster Go Home!"" and ""The Munster's Revenge"" are included too. Season two as previously released did not have the scene selections as season one did, and it doesn't have it in this set either. But the good far outweighs any negatives with this set. I think this set is well worth owning and there are some nice color pictures on the box. Five stars from me!",1222387200,17,1368,4.285714285714286
3544078,5,B001DZOCZU,"From the windy Mockingbird Heights at 1313 Mockingbird Lane, The Munsters come to send goosebumping, rib-tickling '60s wit and humor to your funny bone with The Munsters - The Complete Series!

for awhile. I'm really looking forward to watching more.

As for the actual quality of the item I'm kinda mixed. The box set is actually just a repackaging of the seasons

3544172,5,B001DZOCZU,"There have been many great TV controversies: Mary Ann vs. Ginger, Jeannie vs. Samantha, Old Darrin vs. New Darrin, Kirk vs. Picard. But none of them have aroused as much passion as The Munsters vs. The Addams Family. Don't get me wrong: I love both shows. But I find the Munsters a little easier to identify with. While the Addamses were rich eccentrics, the Munsters were more blue-collar. Herman worked in a funeral parlor, and the family coped with difficulties most families have experienced: they worried about having enough money to pay taxes, bills, and their niece Marilyn's college tuition. While ""The Munsters"" may have lacked ""The Addams Family""'s wit and sophistication, it benefited from the unique chemistry of an exceptionally talented cast: Fred Gwynne brought just the right goofy charm to the gentle giant Herman; irresistible ham Al Lewis chewed the scenery as elder statesman Grampa (a Transylvanian count with a Brooklyn accent?; Yvonne de Carlo was appropriately deadpan as long-suffering wife Lily (no matter how much Herman ranted about being ""head of the household,"" it was clear who wore the cape in that family); and Butch Patrick hit all the right notes as son Eddie. The replacement of Beverly Owens by Pat Priest in the role of Marilyn was barely noticed by fans; both ladies were more than adequate as the family ""misfit,"" who helped anchor the show in reality. The series enjoyed star turns by a number of talented guest stars: Paul Lynde, Dom Deluise, Harvey Korman, Joyce Jameson, Barton McLane, Don Rickles, Barbara Babcock, and best of all the great John Carradine in two appearances as Mr. Gateman, Herman's boss at the funeral parlor. Like the Addams, underneath the ghoulish exterior the Munsters were a warm, loving family with strong values who always did the right thing. The show's visual style was almost as old-fashioned as its values, harkening back not only to the Universal horror franchises of the 1930s and 1940s but to the Mack Sennett farces of the early silent era. This boxed set consists of all 70 episodes of the series' all too brief run, as well as the rarely seen pilot (in color) and one color episode. Spread out over 12 discs, the set also includes four documentaries originally seen on A&E's ""Biography"" series and two movies, ""Munster Go Home!"" and ""The Munsters' Revenge,"" the latter especially noticeable for a star turn by Sid Caesar and a comedic style that owed much to Mel Brooks movies. This is a set that will delight classic TV fans, lovers of slapstick humor, and devotees of the occult.",1509494400,2,2561,4.916859122401847

 A show that embraces the differences, unconditional love, logical scientific minds, humor, magic, open mindedness, a loving family with lots of unusual habits and life style choices when compared to the ""average"" suburb resident. The humorous, kind, polite, ""take the higher road"", way they deal with the close minded fearful ""regular"" (normal / average) people is inspiring for those of us who just never fit in with  the ""average"".

Alleged digital enhancement coloration of Herman's face, neck and hands were wrong color because, the original movies had it at light blue and not light green. Herman was a far better character in his own right than Frankenstein's monster, even though it was the inspiration. I was a kid when when I saw  ""Munster Go Home"" at the theater in the 60's and was a Munsters big fan and liked it before the alleged digital enhancement!

3544393,5,B001DZOCZU,"The Munsters is probably one of the most iconic sitcoms of the 1960s.  Despite only lasting two seasons (for a combined total of 70 episodes), the series quickly developed a cult following and has become a timeless classic.  The series satirizes popular monster movies (such as Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolfman, et cetera) as well as the wholesome family sitcoms of the era.  A little bit of trivia: in its initial run, the series ran concurrently with the similar macabre-themed sitcom, The Addams Family.

Over the years, I've bought many ""Complete Series"" sets.  I can easily that this is, without a doubt, the best one I have ever purchased.  Right now, the set is only available in DVD (here's hoping that changes in the future with the cult following this show has).  When I buy a complete series, I try to avoid DVD if I can.  I see way too many overwhelmingly negative reviews about the packaging-- it's made of cheap cardboard, the cases holding the disc are flimsy, it damages the discs way too easy, et cetera-- that is not the case with The Munsters.  Both seasons are packaged in plastic ""book cases"" (I don't know what they're really called).  No cardboard sleeves that you have to slide the disc in and out of here.  Just pop the disc out and pop it back in when you're done.

All 70 episodes are here.  There's even a few great special features.  The season one set contains the original, unaired, 15 minute pilot the creators used to pitch the show (the show contained a different Eddie and Joan Marshall as Phoebe, Herman's wife-- the character was ultimately scrapped and re-written as Lily and re-cast with Yvonne De Carlo).  The second season set contains four documentaries on the series-- A look back at the show and its lasting effect and individual documentaries on actors Fred Gwynne (Herman), Yvonne De Carlo (Lily), and Al Lewis (Grandpa).

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!  When this set says, ""The Complete Series,"" boy does it mean it.  One thing a lot of classic shows did was, if it was popular, there'd be a movie.  Usually a TV movie.  Whenever you buy a ""complete series"" set, the movie (or movies) is usually not available with the set, and you have to hunt it down separately (Murder She Wrote, for example, is guilty of this).  Hoping to spark enough interest to reboot the show, the original cast did 2 movies-- Munsters Go Home, and The Munsters Revenge.  Both movies are present in this set.

This is a lovely, quality set with a great presentation.  I recommend it to any TV fan or Munster's fan.",1484265600,,2532,4.663656884875847

3544448,5,B001DZOCZU,"I love The Munsters, but really out of a sense of nostalgia.  Much of the humor is stale or predictable, more so in the second season than the first.  But it will surprise you every once in a while with a really funny line or situation.  And some of the jokes are sight gags, which can easily be overlooked if you're not paying attention.  (A poster advertising a wrestler named ""Ghengis Cohen"" put me on the floor!)  Gwynne, Lewis and De Carlo have a wonderful chemistry, and it shows in every scene.  Patrick is surprisingly good too, for a child actor.  And whether you prefer Owen or Priest, they both do justice to gorgeous Marilyn - one of the longest running gags in TV history.

The packaging is great.  Nothing extraordinary, but pretty much what you would expect.

Throughout the second season, each episode begins with the Universal logo.  This gets tiring after a while, but it's not intolerable.

The second-to-last disk contains four documentaries - one on the making of The Munsters, and one each on the lives and careers of Gwynne, De Carlo and Lewis.  All of them are very interesting, informative and at times even surprising.

The last disk contains the two movies Munster Go Home and Munster's Revenge.  The first is just a rehash of jokes and gags from the show, and a new Marilyn who fails miserably as Pat Priest's replacement.  The second is so bad, you can almost feel the (noticeably older) cast's embarrassment.  So for a Munsters' fan collection, they're good to own, but not worth watching.",1476576000,,1519,4.693181818181818

3544450,5,B001DZOCZU,"The Munsters  were the  first family of fright only the fright was pure humor and some of the best humor of its time. I was only a teenager when The Munsters first came out. Seeing them all these years later I now understand why I like them so. You get all 70 TV episodes, the first few which were in color. There is a great deal of information on the making of the episodes and you also get the two Fright Fest movies as well. This is one of the TV episodes of the time where they got the best actors early on to complete a great TV watch.  There were a few changes in actors, but in the end they sure got it right. Remember the two Fright Fest movies are in this pack. I wasn't paying attention and ordered the two Fright Fest moves at the same time. No matter I just gave the two movies to a friend who loved them. I sure miss these old TV programs, remember The Adams Family. So many great TV shows during those wonderful 60s.",1475366400,11,930,4.043478260869565

3544456,2,B001DZOCZU,"Fans want new features and are tired of these cash in re-releases of the same content. I think this is the third or forth time this series has been released with these same features. Colorize some new episodes, restore the Marineland Carnival special, include the score/soundtrack, some production stills, new interviews, featurettes, home movies, cast appearances during the show's original run, a ""where are they now"" with the surviving cast. There are so many things that could be done to make these sets special and there's no excuse to keep putting out the same features that have been released to death for the past 15 years. Save the money and do a proper blu-ray release.",1471305600,5,679,4.913043478260869
