7842563,4,6303285821,Adult Sci-Fi that captures the 80's style of film with low budget acting. Still a fun movie for those who like campy adult films with humor & Special effects plus sexy women.,1350518400,4,174,4.46875
7842564,5,6303285821,"This movie was written and directed by Ted A. Bohus.  Arylai (J.J. North), Omay (Leslie Glass), and Shirley (Theresa Lynn), are three Venusians who come to Earth.  As Venusians, complete with moving antennae, they look horrific.  Their transformation into beautiful women is spectacular.  They are very well equipped to seduce men.  At the height of their victim's sexual arousal, they extract all of their bodily fluids by putting a Venusian contraption over their head.  The extracted fluids are sold back on their home planet as an illegal drug.  The remains of their victims are repulsive, to say the least.

Michelle Bauer plays Shampay, who (spoiler alert) is also a Venusian.  She has a romance with Detective Oakenshield (Leon Head), the English detective who is assigned the case of the drained remains.  Detective Oakenshield is the English equivalent of France's Inspector Clouseau, though not nearly as funny.  The violence in this movie is very tongue-in-cheek.  I marveled at the beauty and sexiness of the leading ladies, especially J.J. North, who made too few movies before she quit acting.  I won't spoil the surprise ending, but I must quote Detective Oakenshield.  ""Women!  Can't live with them, can't be sure they're not alien menaces.""  At the end of the movie's closing credits, it reads: Coming Soon - ""Vampire Vixens II: Oakenshield On Venus.""  Unfortunately, that sequel has yet to be made.",1076457600,3,1416,5.140350877192983
7842565,1,6303285821,"VAMPIRE VIXENS FROM VENUS is an absolutly reprehensible movie.  It has no redeeming qualities what-so-ever.  From the (unbelievably) lame jokes, to the endless, pointless nudity, Vampire Vixens From Venus is absolutly  terrible.  There's not much else to say!  It's just plain awful!",961027200,5,283,5.642857142857143
7842566,1,6303285821,"I picked up this movie from Amazon a while ago.  I was in the mood to see what b movie actress Michelle Bauer had been up to.  Unfortunately I picked this thing up.
The basic story goes...there are these aliens that have  come to earth to harvest a drug that is illegal in space as well.  Human  males produce this stuff at the height of extacsy, at which time the aliens  (beautifully portrayed by three vixens one being JJ North) suck this stuff  out of the men leaving them like raisins.
Some funny moments in this  movie but the detective's slapstick and stupid humour really made this  movie stink.  Michelle Bauer isn't the star I thought she was in this  movie, but she does have an okay role as well.
This is a campy teen T  & A movie with a very annoying detective in it.",911606400,23,780,4.267123287671233
