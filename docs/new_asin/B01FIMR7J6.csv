8760844,5,B01FIMR7J6,"All the fun of the other AT4W DVDs in one convenient little package. The despite the copyright issues of putting in the regular jokes, the reviews are still funny, and I'm still not sure what the answer to the question ""Where'd he purchase that?"" is.",1468800000,,250,4.5777777777777775
8760845,5,B01FIMR7J6,"This is a compilation of the ""Secret Origins"" ""Editorial Mandate"" and ""Holiday Issue"" DVDs all wrapped up into one disc. I have the volumes and they are all awesome. I loved every episode of Atop the Fourth Wall on the DVDs, just hilarious. Between punching Hitler, killing snowmen, and a female superhero called Tomboy it's great. Also there's 2 great riffs and some cool documentary stuff. The only thing that's missing is the riff on the Scrooge movie and honestly I'll admit your not missing much with that omission. Plus buying it this way is much cheaper.",1464480000,3,561,4.793814432989691
