8086934,5,B000BI7XTM,"This charismatic singer really involves the listener and viewer in a fun musical experience!  His program features interaction with his audience and displays how re-cycled materials can be used to create musical instruments.  My favorite is his drum....  a large, upside-down ""Bucket of Joy.""  I buy multiple copies of this because it's such a great gift to keep on hand.  Children from ages 2 to 10 find it irresistable.  I do too!",1389225600,,432,4.930555555555555
