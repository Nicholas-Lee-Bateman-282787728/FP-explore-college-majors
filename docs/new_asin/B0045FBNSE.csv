8416653,4,B0045FBNSE,I had to resume my workouts after 5 years of surgeries using the intermediate workout because my VHS tape for the basic workout unraveled and it wasn't available on DVD for the Performer.  I was so disappointed but I braved the intermediate workout pretty well.  I just don't do some of the harder exercises.  Love my Pilates Performer but would love to get the newer Reformer model with the workouts on DVD.,1371081600,,408,4.638888888888889
8416654,2,B0045FBNSE,"I already own the Basic workout and thought that I would like to try the Intermediate to further my workout progress.  I was very excited to receive it, but other than 2 exercises...the tape was exactly the same!  I feel that it was the biggest waste of money and that I was decieved!!  Two thumbs down for this item!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Performer-Intermediate-Workout/dp/B0045FBNSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates Performer: Intermediate Workout</a>",1304294400,,511,6.8307692307692305
