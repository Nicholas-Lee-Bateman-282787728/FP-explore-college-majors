6167956,2,B00HLT0YTK,Not as good as I expected it would be.  Had read about this for a long time and was curious to see it.  Ultimately disappointing.  Not Stanwyck at her best.,1470528000,,156,4.133333333333334

6167958,4,B00HLT0YTK,"Old days when whites played Chinese, but today Blacks play whites so guess all evens out?  Was an odd end game. War lord's  army only there for the money, no loyalty; when they left, he quit..  But plot inane, so acting..  Stanwyck  was pleasantly naive, bit stupid; not the  sexy, hip woman she played later. So fun to watch.",1461024000,,326,4.440677966101695

6167960,4,B00HLT0YTK,"Hard to get past Anglo playing Asian, Stanwyck surprisingly hapless. Shockingly overt pre-code violence, that and the white woman being sexually menaced by the yellow devils. Image quality of transfer OK, certainly watchable if you've seen others from this era.",1431820800,,261,5.55
6167961,5,B00HLT0YTK,"This is a wonderful film and an early one for Barbara Stanwyck.  Although I am not a big fan, this is one film I love.  It is a very romantic and fantasy type of film so it is best not to expect much accuracy here.  I highly recommend this film and it is in black and white regardless of the color cover representation.",1425081600,5,319,4.031746031746032
6167962,5,B00HLT0YTK,This was a beautiful tragic love story. I had never seen Nils Aster and he was brilliant.,1414886400,10,89,4.294117647058823
6167963,5,B00HLT0YTK,I loved the movie.  It was fascinating.  I especially enjoyed the dream sequence.  Anything Barbara Stanwyck is in is great.  Nils Aster was excellent as well.  I plan to enjoy this movie many times.,1408406400,7,199,4.735294117647059
6167964,5,B00HLT0YTK,"THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN was the first film screened at Radio City Music Hall.  Opening with great fanfare on January 3, 1933 the film was, unfortunately, pulled after only two weeks and disappeared from cinemas.  The main complaint against it was that many viewers could not abide the idea of interracial romance and the subsequent fear of miscegenation (remember, this was 1933).  The people involved with the production claim to have been surprised by the reaction of the public but one has to wonder.  The head of Columbia studios had given Frank Capra the go-ahead to direct an ""arty s**t"" movie to impress the film cognoscenti so he could not have been too surprised, even though he authorized spending vast sums of money to its production.

Years later, inevitably, the movie was attacked for its 'orientalism' and the casting of Nils Asther as General Yen, the Chinese warlord who basically kidnapped the missionary Megan Davis (played by Barbara Stanwyck).  All of this was too bad as THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN is more than a curiosity of its time.  Briefly, Stanwyck arrives in 1920's Shanghai in the midst of a civil war to marry her fiance of  three years who has preceded her there.  One of the first people she meets after landing is the eponymous general in mufti whose car has just run over her ricksha man.  She berates the general but is urged by another American missionary to get along as she is, after all, getting married as soon as she arrives at the home of another long-time missionary (the scene of Capra's first piece of slyness, about which more later), but not before General Yen gives her an appraising look.  Skipping through a series of misadventures, Stanwyck ends up on Yen's train back to the province he controls.  The movie really takes off at this point and it would give too much away to tell what happens but suffice it to say that moral, spiritual, and amorous complications ensue leading to a penultimate scene that is shattering.  I hope this will not come as a spoiler, but in the last scene Stanwyck doesn't say a word but her facial reactions entirely make up for her somewhat wobbly performance leading up to the finale.

The subversive aspect of this film goes beyond interracial romance and extends to questions of cultural misunderstandings involving war, betrayal, lust, and tyranny.  Then there is the religious aspect.  As the movie opens, there is a montage of the chaotic violence reigning in Shanghai in this period but meanwhile, back at the home of the missionary who is to officiate at Stanwyck's marriage, many of the Western missionaries are gathered but the talk is not of the chaos outside, but of the prospective bride.  The obliviousness of these people is grotesque.  One missionary bemoans that he has been in China for fifty years but doesn't understand the Chinese (and proceeds to illustrate his ignorance with a particularly ghastly story -- so much for fifty year's work).  The subversiveness extends to the scenes in Yen's province (again, not to give anything away) but it forces the viewer to examine his or her feeling on several issues.

As stated before, the staging is magnificent.  No detail was forgotten in the incredibly lush sets.  The scenes involving the Moon are all dreamlike and they are reminiscent of the artistry of Gustav Klimt.  The costumes are peerless.  Stanwyck's dream sequence (which probably stoked the 'orientalism' complaints), while not as sophisticated as say, the dream sequence in Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, nevertheless is effective and is actually a device which propels Stanwyck's  personal awakening.  Nils Asther gives a remarkable and convincing performance and he is ably supported by Walter Connolly as Jones, Toshia Mori as Mah-li, and Richard Loo as Yen's chief aide.  Stanwyck is okay, but this is not her greatest performance.  She does a good job, however, in conveying the changes in her views on several topics (again, no spoilers here).

This film has rapidly become one of my favorites and I hope others will find it to be as interesting.",1405555200,25,4073,4.896501457725948
6167965,4,B00HLT0YTK,"The DVD Talk website gave this Sony Choice Collection DVD top marks for picture quality. Having seen hundreds of DVDs, I must agree: it looks exceptional by standard-definition standards!

Although the image has a grainy, soft-focus appearance -- presumably inherent in Joseph Walker's original cinematography, or perhaps the consequence of decades of celluloid deterioration and duping -- there is none of the edge-enhancement, moiring or smearing which blight most DVDs. Equally impressive is that not a single scratch or spot can be seen throughout this 87-minute, 81-year-old film. (Neither can any bonus material be seen on the DVD, alas.)

The picture quality is easily on a par with, say, the Criterion Collection box set of Josef von Sternberg's silent masterpieces -- and Frank Capra's use of composition and contrast gives Sternberg a run for his money too!

Certainly one could complain that the plot, however lushly shot, is slight at best, silly at worst. But this is also true of very many rightly-acclaimed movies, from 'The Docks of New York' to 'Chungking Express' (to name just two).",1399334400,12,1101,5.209039548022599
8633297,4,B00HLT0YTK,"Really would like to give this more of a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't allow half-stars. While Barbara Stanwyck gives her usual remarkable performance as Megan Davis and Capra's camera angles and cinematography choices are on-point, the changes from the novel in terms of the main characters' romantic involvement bothered me. I thought it an unnecessary addition to an already interesting story. (That said, the Chinese-vampire nightmare Capra added to the script is really well done.)",1529884800,,480,5.413333333333333
8633298,2,B00HLT0YTK,I bought this because it was recommended as one of the unsung great movies of the past. I know now why it went unsung. Weird and unrealistic.,1529798400,,141,4.2592592592592595
8633299,4,B00HLT0YTK,It's all about Barbara. Movie obviously very dated and slow and filmed in the back lot. But interesting pre-code flavour (pretty puritan still). Print pretty good,1518652800,,162,5.269230769230769
8633300,5,B00HLT0YTK,Wonderful old movie! Beautiful black and white cinema photography. Interesting study of naivete and betrayal.,1515110400,,109,6.333333333333333
8633301,5,B00HLT0YTK,"A different kind of Frank Capra film with a stunning Barbara Stanwyck. Its set in revolutionary China, but its really a love story. Worth the time.",1513987200,,147,4.6923076923076925

8633304,5,B00HLT0YTK,"This is one of my favourite films. A Pre-Code film made by Frank Capra in 1932 starring his favourite leading lady Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther who was called the male Greta Garbo as he was from Sweden .  It is an interracial romance between a Chinese General (Asther ) and an American missionary (Stanwyck )  which shows the futility and harm of  Christian missionaries who go to a foreign country when they understand nothing and know very little about the Country .  It is a very revealing story of how Christians can view behaviour in an entirely wrong way because they don't understand that their moral code and ethics do not always apply when outside of Western Culture .  .  In this film it has  a devastating effect on the Chinese General and the American Missionary !!  It is very educational in an extremely entertaining format ! It was the first time in my life that I ever found Barbara Stanwyck looking sexy and alluring.

I highly recommend this film !!",1501459200,2,971,4.598837209302325
8633305,5,B00HLT0YTK,"I love this movie, but after the original DVD was damaged somehow, I ordered another.  It arrived ""unplayable"".  I don't know what is wrong, but I'm trying once more time to get a working copy.",1484006400,2,193,4.485714285714286
8633306,4,B00HLT0YTK,"The Bitter Tea of General Yen was one of the most controversial films of the early 30s because of the romantic involvement of a Missionary (Barbara Stanwyck) who is rescued by a Chinese war lord (Nils Asther).

Variety said ""Seeing a Chinaman attempting to romance with a pretty and supposedly decent young American white woman is bound to evoke adverse reaction."" The New York Times called it scarcely plausible. The film was banned in some parts of the British Empire and severely edited in other parts.

Cinema at this time demanded that sex between whites and non-whites had to meet a bad end, often death. In Sons of the Gods (1930) the women are offended to be next to chinks, and Constance Bennett whips Richard Barthelmess when she learns that he hid his Chinese background from her. In Madame Butterfly (1932) Asian Sylvia Sydney commits hari kari when Cary Grant marries a white woman. In Bordertown (1935), lust for a Mexican (Paul Muni) leads Bette Davis on a path to murder and insanity. Even as late as 1957 (Sayonara), Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki commit suicide because they cannot be together, and John Wayne seeks to kill his niece in The Searchers (1956) because she has been living with Indians.

Sultry Barbara Stanwyck (1907-90) made more than 80 films and was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (Stella Dallas, Ball of Fire, Double Indemnity, Sorry Wrong Number). She won 3 Emmys (The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Big Valley). AFI lists her as # 11 among the Top 100 Greatest Screen Legends. This is one of her best pre- Oscar roles.

Nils Asther (1897-1981) was a leading actor in Sweden and came to the US in 1927. This was his most famous role and he is excellent.

FWIW  Another Swedish actor, Warner Oland, also played Asian characters, starting with The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu (1929) and continuing in
the many Charlie Chan films. Until the 60s (and even later) non-whites were consistently played by whites in films like Birth of a Nation, Last of the Mohicans, Madame Butterfly, The Mask of Fu Manchu, Viva Villa, Bordertown, etc.

Walter Connolly (1887-1940) plays an American adviser to the General. He appeared in some 50 films between 1914 and 1939, and is best known as Claudette Colberts father from Oscar winner It Happened One Night and as the title role from The Great Victor Herbert (1939)

FWIW  Connolly was so convincing as the scoundrelous businessman seeking to interfere in the internal politics of China that as late as the 1950s the State Department was still requesting edits.

Richard Loo (1903-1983) has a small part as an aide to General Yen. Loo was Master Sun (the Weapons Master) in the TV series Kung Fu. Between 1942 and 1981 Loo appeared in more than 100 films.

Frank Capra (1897-1991) directs. He began in the silent era in 1915, ultimately made nearly 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, winning 3 times (It Happened One Night, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and You Cant Take it With You). Hes best known for his small town comedies, but this was a style he developed after this film.

This was the fourth of five films in which Capra directed Stanwyck. Capra said she was destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras. In a Hollywood popularity contest she would win first prize hands down.""

The photography is courtesy of Joseph Walker (1892-1985), Capras favorite cinematographer  they made 18 films together. Walker was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (You cant Take it With You, Only Angels Have Wings, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, The Jolson Story) although his legacy is best remembered for the invention of the zoom lense. His work on the mob scenes and the war are particularly noteworthy, as is the dream sequence, especially considering the date.

The film was a box office bomb even though it premiered at the opening of Radio City Music Hall. The NY Times called it fairly entertaining and praised the conspicuously good portrayals by Nils Asther and Walter Connolly.

1932 was a good year for films  Grand Hotel was the Oscar and box office king, Jean Harlow had 2 films in the top 10 (Red Headed Woman and Red Dust) as did Miriam Hopkins (Trouble in Paradise and Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) and Wallace Beery (Champ and Grand Hotel). Other notable films that year were I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, Freaks ,A Farewell to Arms, Scarface, Horse Feathers and Tarzan The Ape Man.

Bottom line  an OK film from the early 30s that reveals the prejudices of the period while telling a doomed love story.",1472947200,2,4487,4.707535121328225
