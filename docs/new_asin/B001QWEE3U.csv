8336665,1,B001QWEE3U,"The Blu-Ray is absolutely terrible! If it wasn't for the fact that the cost was so minimal, I would surely have returned it. Let's see, where do I begin? There are a couple actual vidoes of choirs and singers performing but the quality of the picture is grainy, the performances amateurish, and simply lacking. After that, the rest of the blu-ray consist of ""elevator"" type spiritual music with lots of religous scenes similar to Catholic churches, statues and symbols. I was extremely disappointed and felt ripped off. Please do not waste your time and money. It's not worth the material it was reproduced on.",1316736000,3,610,4.875
8336666,1,B001QWEE3U,"Beautiful Church images in the traditional group, however mediocre recordings and only poorly done up-conversions of live performances.",1240012800,4,135,6.555555555555555
8336667,5,B001QWEE3U,"This is a fabulous blu-ray disc, filled with lots of soul.  The songs performed all sound incredible and the scenes featured on the disc are amazing to look at.  I would highly recommend this blu-ray to add to your collection, it really gets your in a great mood!",1238112000,,263,4.458333333333333
