8214864,5,B00005KB6K,"Rayearth is a fantastic series about three school girls, Hikari (Shining), Umi (Ocean), and Fuu (Windstorm).  Finally the three girls revive the Rune-God and they are given mechas (giant robots like Gundams or Evas).  This becomes a turning point in the series since the Rune-God is one of the most vital elements in the decisive battle.  However there are prophecies that speak of the Magic Knights which only shows the three girls that their quest is far from over, as they thought, and in truth it has just begun.
This is the third disc of the memorial box being sold individually.  It contains the episodes nine through twelve.  In all honestly, buy the boxed set.  It will save you more money.
Magic Knight Rayearth is a fantastic series which has two seasons out, and a rumored third one in the making.  The art, characters, plot, and music are unforgettable.  I highly suggest it.",990057600,6,887,4.751633986928105
