3715034,4,B0012DT2AS,I have been to Death Valley three times now (oddly enough in the summer at 110 degrees plus).  I have to go there again. when the temperature is closer to 90 degrees.  There were places to see that I have missed on the previous three visit. This video shows much more than I thought it would.,1415923200,,292,4.196428571428571
3715035,3,B0012DT2AS,"narration very superficial in content, historic comments too short or incomplete, the region of Death Valley not correlated to the surrounding regions, very limited info about the formerly Indian occupants, no addressing of the fauna and its survival....",1388880000,,254,5.7105263157894735
3715036,4,B0012DT2AS,"We really enjoyed this show as it exposed us to the diversity of geography in this place - much more variety than we realized, never having been there. This program adds it to the list of places we hope to visit.",1364083200,,212,4.195121951219512
8326023,1,B0012DT2AS,"Poor in almost every way. With subject matter as beautiful as the Death Valley landscape, you would have to put forth much effort to come up with something as poorly done as this. The producer succeeded in doing just that. Repeated slides with an awful musical accompaniment, a photographer that obviously fed a coyote to get the animal on camera, not caring that s/he likely doomed that animal. Slow moving, repetitive, boring music, unimaginative narration that hit every area they could with poor results. There are much better documentaries available, so don't waste your time with this one.",1518134400,,595,5.081632653061225
8326024,1,B0012DT2AS,"Quite poor - photography, music and narration. Low point was a scene of a coyote eating a slice of bread it had just been given - an illegal and inappropriate act dangerous to both the coyote and people. Narrator seemed to have read a couple of brochures. Photographer was below average and seemed to film over just a day or two. Some scenes badly bleached. My son, who loves videos, said it was boring.",1491696000,,403,4.45945945945946
8326025,1,B0012DT2AS,"For one thing, Death Valley is not in Nevada, it is in California,...and no commentary,...just video,...big deal.",1481155200,,113,5.705882352941177
8326026,1,B0012DT2AS,"Ever watch those nature clips narrated by Snoop Dogg, that, while entertaining, teach you nothing? It's like that except really boring. Do a search for the documentary made by PBS (not on Amazon) for something that's actually worth your time. Of course, if you're just looking for some background picutres to show on a wall somewhere, this would work on mute.",1459209600,,359,4.901639344262295

8326028,2,B0012DT2AS,"Cinematography was meh, writing was worse. A lot of narration without saying much at all.",1446422400,,89,5.0

8326031,3,B0012DT2AS,"I am an avid viewer of nature and science documentaries.  This one has nice pictures and pans of Death Valley, but I was disappointed that there were little or no in-depth zoom-in info with experts.",1424908800,,198,4.6571428571428575
8326032,3,B0012DT2AS,It is good but a bit dull sometimes.,1418083200,,36,3.625
