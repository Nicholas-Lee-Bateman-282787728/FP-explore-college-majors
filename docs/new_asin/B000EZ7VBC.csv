8159125,4,B000EZ7VBC,"Bad Girls series 7 is a really great series. Thankfully Jim Fenner finally dies. This character started the whole series really well. But you kind of grew bored with him. Nothing new just dragged out. This series we meet new characters like Pat Kerrigan. She is similar to Yvonne Atkins. Natalie Buxton turns into a bitch. Together they fight so many times.

One of the best parts of this series is it gives Sylvia Hollamby a long story. A good story that shows her a lot in it. She is my fave character and I am glad to see her more.

A few unexplained stories that leave you thinking what happened? Like Colin and Frances relationship.",1445212800,,637,4.482758620689655
