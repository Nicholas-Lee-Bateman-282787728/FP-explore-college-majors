8379236,5,B002SB2PRK,This is my favorite show and I am unhappy that it went off the air. This show has tried and probably has broken stereotypes in canada and the US. The US is a ready for a show like this but people are too afraid to say that. Thank you canada!!,1339286400,,242,3.86

8379238,5,B002SB2PRK,"Little Mosque on the Prairie is a wildly popular Canadian TV series set in small-town Saskatchewan. The local mosque has hired a new imam, a former Toronto lawyer, who arrives to find the mosque situated in the rented basement of an Anglican church. Members of the community include an a muslim contractor and his not-so-muslim ex-Anglican wife, their feminist hijab-wearing MD daughter, a hyper-conservative muslim professor and his thoroughly Canadian daughter, the diner owner who serves goat curry on Thursdays, and so on. The broader community includes a muslim-baiting radio host (think loveable limbaugh), the inter-faith promoting Anglican priest, and a power-crazed lady mayor who has difficulty cracking the muslim demographic.

Writers include practicing muslim, and the series is an excellent opportunity to learn something about Islam, the diversity of belief within the community, and how this plays out in a small prairie town in the context of Canadian multiculturalism. The dialogue is intelligent, the acting marvelous, the satire gentle and pointed at both muslims and their Christian neighbors.

LMotP is now in it's fifth season: just take my word on the first season, and pick up the others if you like. Assalamu Alaikum, peace be with you.",1298937600,5,1262,5.3686868686868685
