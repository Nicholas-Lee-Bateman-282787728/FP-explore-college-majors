5993498,5,B00FJ6CL2K,Good workout your legs will look great with this challenging and fun workout. The way in which Cathe challenges your muscles is different and avoids a sense of boredom,1400198400,,167,4.793103448275862
5993499,5,B00FJ6CL2K,"As always, she delivers!  I had a taste of the local YMCA classes recently, and I'm very proud to say that I was able to surpass each class because of Cathe's teachings.  While visiting out of town, I couldn't bring my Cathe repertoire, so the Y was it.  Because of Cathe, I was able to keep up, move fast and do so much more than others in the class.

I have been doing Cathe for a number of years, and she still makes me work . . . And work HARD!  But I get results, I get a wonderful workout and I just plain feel good!  What else could a person want?

I'm noticing tone in my legs, my abs, my overall body just feels good!  What else can I say?  She'll give you results, just DO the tapes at least 5 days a week, or as often as your time permits.  She won't fail.",1395360000,,767,3.890322580645161
5993500,5,B00FJ6CL2K,"I love this workout. There are tons of squats that work the legs and tighten the muscle, it is exactly what I was looking for. Plus weights are used for some of the squats which make them even more effective. Would not get rid of this DVD no matter what! Highly recommend.",1394841600,4,272,4.25
5993501,1,B00FJ6CL2K,"Cathe made her reputation on videos for advanced exercisers. In recent years she has upped the number of videos, branched out too much, and lost what was special about her. This video is not cardio, it's not effective weight training for legs, the rests are WAY too long for the minimal amount of exertion required... Probably suitable for the beginner, but for me, for now I'm using this merely as an extended warmup. Honestly, if you're looking for a high-rep, low-weight workout, the legs segment in Jessica Smith's 10-min solution bootcamp video provides a better workout in 10 minutes than this video does in 35, or try anything by Jari Love.",1393804800,4,647,4.837837837837838
5993502,4,B00FJ6CL2K,"After my first workout with LL&A, I wasn't impressed.  It was OK, but I didn't fall in love with it and actually thought about 'releasing' it from my collection.  Then I decided to give it another shot, as it was listed on my Dec 2013 Rotation from Cathe.  I am glad I did, because I liked it much better the second time around.

LL&A focuses on isolating the quad muscle as much as possible, which is hard to do without a leg extension machine.  It is the perfect training companion to the Great Glutes, also released by Cathe in this series where the focus is on the outer thighs and glutes.

The workout warms you up and moves into the standing weighted section.  Then there is a short chair section, which basically means you need something to hold onto while you work the quad muscle.  There is a floorwork leg section, before you move into the ab work.

All in all, it's an efficient workout for the legs and abs, with the focus on the quad muscle.  It pairs well with the Great Glutes, and the pair will be a nice 'set' on days when you want to workout the legs without a lot of pylo work.",1386633600,2,1096,4.251207729468599
5993503,5,B00FJ6CL2K,"I must admit when I first did this workout, I was prepared to not like it.  I thought, ""Oh no, more metabolic conditioning with the squat and overhead press with 8 pound weights. This is going to be an easy workout.""  Boy was I wrong!  Yes, there are the squat overheads with 8 pound weights, but there are lots of new and fun exercises.  About 20 minutes into the workout, I realized I was breathing quite heavy and my heart rate was up there.  I was exercising hard but having so much fun, I didn't even notice it!  All part of Cathe's magic in this series.

I would describe this workout as barre meets cardio and light toning.  I usually get better results in my legs with heavy weights, but it's good to mix things up.

The original workout times:

Warm Up - 6:10
Workout--36:44
Cool Down--5:39
Total--48:33.

The premix options range from 35 minutes to 61 minutes (original workout plus the additional barre section), so there should be something for everyone.  I love to workout for at least an hour, so I am happy to do the 61 minute workout.

Why I loved this workout:

* It sneaks up on you.  I'm sure my leg muscles will be talking to me tomorrow!  I felt I got a good workout, but I was not exhausted at the end.  Sure those super-intense workouts have a place in my rotation, but this workout is perfect for those days that I want to work my legs, but not to exhaustion.

* It really works your legs.  When Miss Cathe brought out the pink firewalker loop (the easiest one), I thought I might use the green one.  Needless to say, I was very happy that I stuck with the pink one since my muscles were screaming.

* The pink firewalker band coordinates perfectly with my exercise shoes.  Okay, so this has nothing to do with the workout, but looking the two together helped distract me from the `pain' of the exercises.

* Your heart rate is elevated but with no high impact.  I love exercises that accomplish this!

* No planks in the ab section - yay.  I know planks do wonders for my core, but they aggravate my wrists.  Cathe puts a new twist on crunches, so it's fun.  Well, maybe not fun, but the time seems to fly by.

* Minimal equipment is used.  All you need for this workout are:  dumbbells, pink firewalker loop, chair and mat.  As you get stronger, you can increase your weights.  Cathe uses 8 pound dumbbells and that's what I used and they were plenty heavy!

* The triple track music option.  I usually don't like Cathe's taste in music and find it annoying.  For this workout, the normal track with vocals seemed to overpower Cathe's voice.  Next time I will try the instrumental track.

There were a few moves that may cause injuries.  The first move is during the leg section where you are curtsying and then picking up the weights to do an overhead press.  Cathe moves pretty quickly during this move and I was afraid that I would tweak my back because I was rushing to pick up the weights.  The second move is the first move in the ab section where you have your legs extended and you roll down and roll back up.  If you're not careful and doing a c-curve, you won't be working your abs and you can tweak your back.

Overall, I loved this workout.  Even if you're an advanced beginner or intermediate exerciser, you can do this workout.  It's not just for advanced exercisers.",1380844800,16,3307,4.375617792421746

8616007,5,B00FJ6CL2K,"What a great workout! The routine was fun, varied, and engaging of all my leg muscles and abs. Cathe does such a great job at cueing and motivating her viewers. She and her crew had wonderful form throughout, didn't matter who I was watching, each doing it extremely well. I loved the music, upbeat and recognizable. Very nicely done! The exercises were fun, I loved how they flowed from one to the other. I really enjoy switching things up with bands, discs, and weights. Makes the time fly by and feels very compete once done. I add in the extra Barre segment too, that is a scorcher! What really takes this one to the top as far as reviews go was how Cathe and her crew genuinely were enjoying the workout! They too were having fun! I felt right there in the room with them. Nice work Cathe!!",1494720000,,795,4.378378378378378
8616008,5,B00FJ6CL2K,Awesome leg workout.  Typical Cathe quality of dvd and workout.,1484784000,,63,5.3
8616009,5,B00FJ6CL2K,"This isn't as advanced as most of Cathe's leg workouts but I really enjoyed it and think it's a great supplement to her XTrain ""Cardio Leg Blast"" DVD.  ""Lean Legs & Abs"" uses light weights (8 pounds, although I might up them to 10 the next time I do the video) and while the sets are shorter than what she usually puts out they incorporate both leg and weight work, which increases the heart rate and calorie burn.  Weighted moves include regular squats with overhead presses, rear lunges with bicep curls, side lunges with upright rows, and sumo squats with bicep curls to an overhead press.  Cathe does take more time between sets but for me it was fine because it allowed my heart rate to calm down.  The only other weighted exercise has you placing the weight on your thigh and doing a series of leg raises; I didn't find these challenging but the firewalkers were a different story.  I probably could have used a heavier loop (I stuck with light resistance) for the zig zag steps but the floor work with the loop had my thighs screaming.  At that point I was happy that the sets were brief!  The barre section consisted of typical barre moves: first and second position plie pulses, leg raises at various angles, etc.  My legs were so spent that I struggled a bit there as well.  I was disappointed with the ab portion because I found it to be too short and too back intensive.  I liked that there were new moves but and that she used the 8 pound weight for a few of them but my tailbone took a beating; as another reviewer noted, one exercise that puts stress on the back is OK but two or three in a row is too much.  My abs were somewhat challenged but the section was relatively easy in comparison to the bonus abs included in her XTrain series and Abs Circuits DVD.

This workout would be good for ""light"" days despite the cardio effect in the first 20 minutes.  It would be a nice alternative to XTrain's ""Cardio Legs Blast,"" which incorporates heavy weights and HiiT bursts (for the record it's my favorite XTrain video).  I agree that ""Lean Legs & Abs"" is oddly disjointed and not at an advanced level but I enjoyed it and liked the music.  And since I love Cathe I'd really have to have a problem with anything she does to give a rating of less than five stars.  The intensity can be increased by upping the weights and doing more reps of everything (as Cathe notes at one point).  Recommend for intermediate exercisers!",1461801600,2,2433,4.4192825112107625
8616010,5,B00FJ6CL2K,"great workout, I supplement with butts and guts",1431561600,,47,5.0
8616011,5,B00FJ6CL2K,"So, this workout wasn't even on my radar until one day I was reading about workouts and I read a mini review that went something like this, ""This is probably Cathe's easiest lower-body workout ever!"" Well, my intermediate-level exerciser's ears perked right up because I don't get Cathe's lower-body workouts - I like to be able to walk and I'm not a glutton for punishment! I've seen this workout described as barre meets cardio and light toning. That's probably a good description.

So far, I've just done the workout itself, not any premixes. The original workout times are:

Warm Up - 6:10
Workout--36:44
Cool Down--5:39
Total--48:33.

The premix options range from 61 minutes (original workout plus the additional barre section) to 35 minutes, so everyone should be able to find a component of this workout that they can do. The premixes include:

Lean Legs and Abs + Bonus Barre: (Warm Up, Compound Legs, Chair/Firewalkers, Bonus Barre, Core, Stretch)
Lean Legs and Abs + Bonus Barre (No Core): (Warm Up, Compound Legs, Chair/Firewalkers, Bonus Barre, Stretch)
Lean Legs and Abs + Bonus Barre (No Chair/Firewalkers): (Warm Up, Compound Legs, Bonus Barre, Core, Stretch)
Timesaver #1 (No Chair/Firewalkers): Warm Up, Compound Legs, Core, Stretch)
Timesaver #2 (No Core): Warm Up, Compound Legs, Chair/Firewalker,Stretch)
Timesaver #3 (Chair/Firewalkers & Barre): Warm Up, Chair/Firewalkers, Barre, Stretch)

Here are some thoughts about the sections:

Segment One: Compound Legs

This segment is full of compound exercises like Squat Press. It is designed with an emphasis on legs but includes moves that get your heart rate up. Cathe even identifies when the heart rate is supposed to climb and when it should come back down. Light weights are used to enhance the cardio effect, not for serious strength work. Cathe uses 8s, I use 3s or 5s.

Segment Two  Chair and Firewalker Band (strength band)

She starts with a standing move holding the chair. You put a weight on your quad as you lift your leg to work it. This bothered my standing leg with the bad knee. Other than that issue, it wasn't too bad. Then you use a round band (she uses her Firewalker Band and I used my Spri loop)around your ankles while you travel forward in a zigzag walk to a lateral skate. I really enjoyed this move. The section ends on the floor using the band with leg lifts.

Segment Three  Core Segment

This section includes situps, several variations of crunches, leg isolation holds, scissors, X-crunches, a couple of different types of twists, and bicycles. It is harder core work than I want to do, than I can do, so I won't be using this segment.

Bonus Segment  Barre

This segment includes different pulse squats and leg lifts. It isn't super hard, but it does give a different way of working with the legs. And, I assume, that it is a nice section to include in some of the premixes.

My legs felt well worked out after doing this DVD. I am an intermediate exerciser and am comfortable doing this workout. Because of bad knees, my squats and lunges are more shallow than hers or those of her background exercisers. Yet, it works for me.",1424217600,2,3130,4.853383458646617

8616013,2,B00FJ6CL2K,I've been using Cathe dvd's for years. Love them! Very intense and super effective.  However I don't feel this is one of her best. Way too easy - much easier than most of her workouts. The Great Glutes dvd that is supposed to compliment this one is phenomenal though!  Bought that one on amazon and LOVE it!!!,1420243200,3,309,4.4035087719298245
