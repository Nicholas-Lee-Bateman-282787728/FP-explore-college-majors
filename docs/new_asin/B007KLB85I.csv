8519131,3,B007KLB85I,not really thrilled with the quality and don't pay 26.99 like i did! It is not worth the money! It did have some song live that i had not heard.,1418428800,,144,3.8333333333333335

8519133,5,B007KLB85I,Are you a Van Halen fan? I mean a REAL Van Halen Fan ! Then this is a MUST HAVE. Listen to one of the greatest Music groups of the rock era. The 1989 sounds and easy to remember words to the songs make you feel like you are right there.,1392249600,,236,3.6470588235294117
8519134,2,B007KLB85I,"What has always got to me about this wonderful rock band is the lack of footage of them of any real quality that actually exists! Ok ok there are bits here and there on the web but with a band of such magnitude it is really weird that everytime we get a new release of the boys ,its just like this. Does anyone remember how dvd was sold to us originaly as we held our videos close to our hearts? Digital remastering of picture and sound, extras, outakes, easter eggs, audio commentaries",1369872000,3,486,4.293478260869565
8519135,3,B007KLB85I,"iT IS A CONDENSED VERSION,I BELIEVE, OF THAT CONCERT. JUST SONGS NO LEAD SINGER INTERACTION WITH CROWD. VERY WEIRD????? THINGS ARE MISSING.",1364428800,3,139,5.363636363636363
8519136,3,B007KLB85I,"Looks like your watching an old VHS tape, only the up close shots are somewhat clear but the shots from beyond the stage are fuzzy and blurry. Not very happy with the quality, would not recommend.",1362096000,5,196,4.472222222222222
8519137,4,B007KLB85I,"I loved OU812!  I really dig Sammy with Van Halen.  Great stuff, I just wish it was longer.  Run time is less than an hour.  But, hey, it's a good hour.",1360281600,2,152,3.806451612903226
