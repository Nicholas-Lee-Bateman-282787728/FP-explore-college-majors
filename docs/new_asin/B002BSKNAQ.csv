8361882,4,B002BSKNAQ,"I have purchased several ""relaxation"" DVD's and was expecting this would be the same but it was the opposite.  It is a fast-paced, up tempo DVD with lively Classical Music set to beautiful scenery that has been timed lapsed.  There are times when geese have been super imposed to give you a ""bird's eye view"" perspective of the landscape. (Just a note - this is not filmed in HD).  If you are looking for a DVD of North America produced in a unique way, you would enjoy this DVD.",1416268800,7,479,4.359550561797753
