People tend to speak negatively of hyenas, and this documentary helps prove those people are simply ignorant. The film was well made, despite it's cover, which holds the shown box art, though it looks like it was printed out, with pixels covering the picture. However, the content is what's important, and it definitely holds it's own. The narrator did a good job, and she never became too boring. The footage was very good, and didn't consist of recycled clips and shots from other documentaries. The facts help show why hyenas are so awesome, and I highly recommend this to anyone who either likes hyenas, or isn't a bigot and wants to learn about them.",1343520000,3,778,4.770370370370371

I actually found it to be better than ones produced by National Geographic. FYI: There are 3 different ""Families in the Wild"" DVDs available (sold separately) They are: Hyenas - Lions - Zebras. I found all 3 in the series to be excellent. I highly recommend them to all nature film lovers. You will enjoy them.",1278028800,,450,4.857142857142857
