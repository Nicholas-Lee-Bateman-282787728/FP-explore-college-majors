2383951,5,B000AABKUO,"Like the History Channel, A&E always does such a great job with there various historical documentaries.  The video gives a very good overview of the Black Death that swept over Europe and has a good price as well!",1319760000,2,213,4.605263157894737
2383952,1,B000AABKUO,"Leonard Nimoy takes a back seat to the art used in this DVD sharing of 14th century Europe's experience of bubonic plague.  The interviews and microbiology references are more dumbed down than I've seen anywhere else on any subject, but the old world masters paintings and the narrated diaries give incredible insight on Leonard Nimoy's dialogue.  Actual architecture associated with the black death (where it actually happened) give us a sense of genuineness of the account being shared, but with some of the paintings and contemporary re-enactments used multiple times just to filibuster for filling the time (as is the benchmark practice of Arts & Entertainment documentary DVD's), it becomes tedious and irritating at best - over-riding the educational value due to boring the viewer.  For a 1997 production, this 50 minutes DVD seems more in keeping with the time period of the WWII documentaries genre such as ""Industry On Parade"" (weekly TV series newsreel during the 1950's) and if you took away the paintings from this particular ""Ancient Mysteries: The Black Death"" DVD documentary, you'd put a chronic insomniac on crack that just drank a pot of hi-octane coffee, into a Rip Van Winkle sleep.  Yawn.",1319241600,3,1210,5.126903553299492
2383953,5,B000AABKUO,"According to the ANCIENT MYSTERIES chapter entitled ""The Black Death,"" this disease is transmitted from black rats to the fleas that infest them and then to humans. It may have been introduced to Europe from the Orient aboard trading vessels that harbored at Italian ports. Further evidence: bubonic plague existed in Cathay (China) for so many centuries prior to its European outbreak, locals had learned to move on when their rat population started dying. They probably didn't know this prevented fleas from infecting them.

With a full-blown epidemic in the 1340s and with the death toll mounting, many useless treatments were tried (herbs, bloodletting etc.). Black Death was believed by some to be God's punishment; a sect of Flagellants arose as a result. Their practice was to flay raw a supposed sinner's back with barbed whips, an atonement that would ward off plague, but the open wounds only facilitated contracting this illness. Others believed Jews responsible for plague; a convenient excuse to destroy their villages.

The citizens of London built a wall to keep the epidemic out, but this only contained it within the city. Pope Clement VI survived by taking unorthodox advice. He locked himself in his quarters and kept a smoky fire going at all times. Meanwhile, everywhere else people were dying by the thousands. In just a few years this initial outbreak claimed 40,000,000 lives, almost half of Europe's population.

Reminders of the terror caused by plague stay with us over 600 years later. As an example, when we say ""Bless you"" after someone sneezes, it's a response that originated during those terrible times. One of the final symptoms of oncoming death from the bubonic plague was sneezing, so this blessing was an effort to ward off the disease in the healthy or give comforting anointment to the terminal.

That sneezing symptom has come down to us in a nonsense rhyme which children still chant:

RING AROUND THE ROSIE (first symptom of plague, a rash)
A POCKET FULL OF POSIES (placed there to mask the smell of decaying flesh on a still living person)
ASHES, ASHES (originally: Achoo! Achoo!, the final symptom before death)
ALL FALL DOWN! (whole towns sometimes succumbed within days, thus the line)

BTW: this video is definitely worth seeing!",1272585600,11,2277,5.042553191489362

8077364,1,B000AABKUO,"This documentary A&E and the History channel Scourge of the Black death are the same show ,just different cover art on DVD case  and narration. The History channel the Plague is the best version with great reenactment and interviews, this presentation is slow and boring on this topic which is a interesting and tragic historical event on the virus and all who died from it. It is just a poorly made documentary in my opinion and I can not recommend this DVD for that reason .",1384905600,,476,4.534883720930233
