8517303,1,B007I6ETU6,"I wanted the movie ""And Now Miguel"" starring Clu Gullager  because my husband's father, who died shortly the movie was released, worked as an extra.  I got sent the above item which is not what I expected and is in fact horribly filmed.  I could have done a better job filming the movie, and I have no experience whatsoever.  I contacted the provider on more than one occasion but never got a response.  If I ever want to order a film I will go to Hastings and not have to deal with a unresponsive vedor.  I spent over $30 for a piece of crap (pardon my language).",1406073600,,564,4.224299065420561

set in New Mexico which I remember from my childhood and sadly miss as it has changed much like everywhere
else.",1399334400,,222,4.309523809523809
