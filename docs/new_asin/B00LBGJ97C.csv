8664977,4,B00LBGJ97C,"Kochadaiiyaan is based on an Indian historical epic about the title character and his son Rana. The movie was done in motion capture and while it wasn't as detailed as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes it was like watching a high-level animation.

There are two things that you can expect in an Indian movie  singing and dancing - and this film was no different.  The soundtrack was a good one and the dancing wasn't out of place.  Yeah, there were a couple of scenes where people busted out in a number after a battle but for the most part when someone danced it seemed like it flowed naturally.

The action sequences during the sea battle were outstanding and the action sequences well planned out. It brought to mind the scene where Thor, Loki, and The Warriors Three fought The Storm Giants.

This movie had one of the best uses of a flashback that I have seen. Maybe it was because I wasn't familiar with the story.  During the flashback I learned who Kochadaiiyaan was, how incredible a warrior he was, and why Rana did the things that he did.

Karate has something called kata; in fact most martial arts have a solo practice that is similar. Kochadaiiyaan does a solo form that would have gotten straight 10s.

STORY: Excellent

ACTING: Excellent  Superstar Rajinikanth isn't Andy Serkis but he is 63 years old and played three parts  oh yeah, hes bad to the bone.

VISUALS: The sea battle and Kochadaiiyaans training were outstanding
