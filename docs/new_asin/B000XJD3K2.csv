3003953,5,B000XJD3K2,The Rockford Files season 5 on DVD is definitely worth it.  I believe this was the best detective show ever on TV.  James Garner as Jim Rockford was the everyman's detective.  I can hardly wait for season 6 and then the Rockford Files movies to be available on DVD.,1202428800,6,265,4.36734693877551
3003954,4,B000XJD3K2,"I have to say, it's hard to rate Season 5 any less than the previous four seasons on DVD, but because it's missing Beth, and seems not to have nearly enough Angel, I guess I can take one star away. Still, I believe this may be my favorite detective series.  James Garner is completely believable and natural as the laid back detective. He brings a self-depricating, anti-hero charm to Jim, not a coward, just smart enough to know that you can't dodge a bullet when the gun is pointed at your chest.

Since it's more the same of what I love, I guess I'm wondering what will happen with Season 6, which was only half over when Garner had to leave for health reasons.  I'd like to suggest that it would be nice if Universal combined Season 6 with the movie length comeback of the Rockford files of the 90's.

Video quality is not remastered for high-def, but that shouldn't matter, since what we're dealing with here are studio masters, which were printed on giant tape sets for broadcasting in the 70's.  The quality is really no better or worse than the previous DVD releases - in fact, it's basically what they probably looked like when they debuted originally, and that is part of their charm - so don't let that stop you from purchasing this very entertaining collection.",1202342400,16,1273,4.541484716157205
3003955,3,B000XJD3K2,"Overall, a pretty dreary collection, especially in comparison to the first four magnificent years. In Season Five, there is no Beth Davenport, minimal Angel Martin, and almost half the episodes are clinkers: ""Empty Frame""(Berkeley revolutionaries hijacking a Pacific Palisades art collection? In 1978??); ""Three-Day Affair""; ""Black Mirror""; ""Local Man Eaten""; ""Nehru Jacket""(bottom of the barrel); ""Battle Ax""; ""Guilt""; ""Material Difference""; ""Different Drummer"".

Of course, there are good things too. John Cooper(who should've been given more time). The emergence of Lt. Chapman. But for me the saving grace of the whole year and worth the price of the DVD set is the uncut ""Man Who Saw the Alligators"".

Originally a 74-minute episode(as it is here), but always shown in syndication in 48-minute form, this classic Rockford was written by David Chase, obviously warming up for ""The Sopranos"". Yes, the role of Momma Gagglio is rather annoying, either because of actress Penny Santon or because of Corey Allen's direction of her(at times, she is low-key and complex, so perhaps it was Allen). Other than that, all the new footage is great. We see the decision by Anthony Boy's mom to allow her own son's murder, and this deepens everything, particularly George Loros's wonderful performance as the son. (As it does Joey Aresco as brother Richie.) The road trip stuff between Anthony & Syl is tough and funny. But the real highlight is Joe Sirola, who steals the show. Sirola is a legendary character actor, and has never been better than he is here. Instead of spinning off that silly Richie Brockleman, Cannell & Co. should have created a new show based on Joseph Minnette. (In a way I guess David Chase did just that.) All this really does make 48 minutes which were already classic Rockford into something very special.",1202083200,23,1824,5.117449664429531
3003956,5,B000XJD3K2,"""The Rockford Files"" was a wildly popular, and now, iconographic, television detective series based on the life and work of Jim Rockford, a private detective living in southern California in the 1970's. The series is undoubtedly one of the best television shows ever produced: so good that one almost winces when the word ""television"" is mentioned in context with the show. Although television was the format and forum for the series, the work lays clearly outside the norms of ""good television,"" and moves into areas generally only found in film and drama.

Jim is a genuinely good-hearted, but nevertheless cynical, hero of the common man who makes his sometimes meager income pursuing his unusual and often dangerous job. As an ex-con himself who spent time in jail for a crime he did not commit (and for which he eventually received a full pardon), Jim's street smarts equip him to move through all types of dangerous and unexpectedly dramatic situations that arise as he works his way through his revolving caseload, the ""files"" part of ""The Rockford Files."" Jim's response to questions about his daily rate, usually asked by someone in most every episode, is ""200 dollars a day, plus expenses."" Jim's duties might be to look for a missing person, collect on a debt owed, solve a crime, or anything else that someone might hire a private detective to do.

Jim makes frequent use of his friend in Los Angeles Police Department, Sgt. Dennis Becker, to get important information, but as often as not, pays the favors back by providing help to Becker which allowed Becker to make arrests. Jim claims to be averse to picking up any job that involves real danger. He owns a gun, but rarely uses it, and makes a point of telling anyone who will listen that he doesn't like guns. Nevertheless, it is Jim's care for the individual that generally moves him into danger to help someone else in need. His closest real friend, Angel Martin, is a small-time grifter and con artist who is always trying to con someone out of a few dollars, but never manages to lose Jim's friendship for reasons that may rest more with Jim's sense of responsibility to a person who needs SOMEONE to care for him than for more selfish reasons.

Jim's gold Pontiac Firebird became one of the enduring visual representations of the decade. The car was routinely bruised, dinged, crashed, vandalized, and in one episode, even blown up, but was nevertheless kept in steady repair throughout the entire run of the series. Few automobiles have been so closely identified with a dramatic character while never being the central focus of attention.

The Rockford Files was well-known for extremely strong plot lines, with virtually every episode in the run of the series an outstanding piece of dramatic writing and acting set to full musical score. The music in the first season or two is often exceptionally strong, where we often discover entire episodes seemingly a continuous musical score underpinning the story. (The theme song for the series, played at the beginning of every episode and revisted within episodes as variations on a theme, was immensely popular during the series run, and was catchy enought to be released commercially on the radio waves at some point in the show's run.) Individual episodes focus on a variety of themes, either comic, intrigue, mystery, problem solving, and others, but the common thread in them all is life as viewed through the lens and experiences of Jim's efforts to stay out of trouble while he faces trouble. Episodes typically contains enough twists and turns to keep even the most seasoned watcher on the edge of the seat in trying to figure out the angle or angles that are at play. The commanding and reassuring presence of James Garner, a greatly-loved figure in American movies and television, carries virtually every scene while keeping the plot believable and engaging. The fact that the series could maintain such high levels of realistic credibility while not allowing the viewer to assemble all the pieces until the near end of each episode is simply a marvel of narrative storytelling. These are some of the best examples of premier storytelling in the history of television, and arguably, film.

Many reviews of television shows contain lists of ""best"" episodes. In my own mind, it is simply not possible to create such a list for The Rockford Files. To do so would perhaps do some injustice to the series, because virtually every episode is ""good"" in the basic sense. Yes, there are indeed some episodes that are archetypical examples of mastery in video storytelling, but to be perfectly honest, you can basically pick any episode of The Rockford Files at random, and, assuming you understand the basic premise of the show, chances are you'll have a great viewing experience. But perhaps this is a series best watched by starting with Season One, and watching each episode in order, so that one can fully appreciate the cast of characters, their relationship to one another, and the unfolding story of Jim's life. Along the way, we come to love Rocky as a father and human being, appreciate Denis as an honest and hard-working police officer, admire Beth as a skilled and knowledgeable lawyer, and feel some level of understanding, and yes, even sympathy, for Angel as he cons his way through small-time scams. Running through it all is Jim, a person who often puts others above himself, and has a touch of humanity that appeals to most everyone, and easily makes the series one of the most endearing to ever appear on television.",1200528000,40,5557,4.88865323435843
3003957,5,B000XJD3K2,"My only gripe as a fan since the late 70's was not including any bonuses. Season 6 was an abbreviated season where Garner's stunts and age caught up to him plus declining ratings due to new 1979 shows like Dukes of Hazzard led to its cancellation. This is the last complete season of the series here and is a must own for any fans. I enjoy the later seasons with ""Chappy"".. he brought more emotion to viewers making life difficult for Jim and Becker.",1200441600,2,450,4.369047619047619
3003958,5,B000XJD3K2,"The Rockford Files, in case you haven't seen it, is one of the best examples of dramatic television in the 1970's (if you have seen it you already know that).  The Rockford Files was/is a witty, well written ""detective"" show, a genre that was extremely popular in the 70's and 80's.  If you like Magnum P.I. or Simon and Simon or any other show like that then you'll like The Rockford Files.  Rockford did the same thing before they did it, only better.

James Garner was absolutely perfect as Jim Rockford.  It's just about impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  The show's writers and producers managed to find a perfect balance of drama and comedy (with the comedy coming in the form of dry, sarcastic one liners, usually coming from Rockford) without hurting the dramatic impact of the stories.

The fifth season of the show found those writers and producers on a roll.  The Rockford Files was one of those shows that never saw a slip in quality.  It was a great show from start to finish.  And now nearly the entire run of the series is available on DVD.

Watching the DVD's is almost like going back in time - these episodes (for the most part) haven't looked this good since they first aired back in the 70's.  It's nice, too, to be able to watch uncut episodes (as a couple minutes from each episode of shows from that era are cut for additional ad time when shown on TV in syndication).  Unless you watched the shows in the 70's you might not even know what you were missing when watching the shows in syndication - but now you will get to see those scenes previously deleted for commercial time.

If you're a fan of detective shows with a wry sense of humor then The Rockford Files is for you.",1200355200,49,1712,4.4281150159744405
3003959,5,B000XJD3K2,"Season Five continued the fine writing and impeccible acting that defined The Rockford Files as one of televisions best ever offerings.

In addition, this season has some fantastic guest stars: Rita Moreno, Bo Hopkins, Tom Selleck, Abe Vigoda, Robert Loggia, Jason Evers, Robert Alda, Kathryn Harrold, Mary Fran, Erin Gray, Ted Shackelford, Paul Koslo, Dennis Dugan and Harold Gould to name just a few.

A few of my favorite episodes from this season include:

White on White and nearly Perfect - Wherein Jim works with Lance White (Tom Selleck), a goody two shoes Detective who always comes up smelling like a rose, usually at Rockford's expense.

Black Mirror - A two parter where Jim protects and falls in love with a blind psychologist played by the scrumptious Kathryn Harrold.

A Different Drummer - A strange but absorbing tale that has Rockford on the trail of a sociopath who is harvesting organs from live donors.

What a shame there's only one more season (and a truncated one at that) of the Rockford files to go after this.  Hopefully they'll include all the reunion shows with the 12 episodes of Season Six.

Oh and don't forget ""At the tone leave your name and number, I'll get back to you.""",1196380800,88,2114,4.917613636363637
3003960,4,B000XJD3K2,"I think this 1978-79 Season of this detective drama was the best and probably the most successful season of them all throughout Rockford's whole 6-year run on NBC along with the fact that this was also the last full season of the ROCKFORD FILES since Rockford's 6th Season was only a half season since this private detective drama was cut short when it was abruptly cancelled in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner developing health problems.

Therefore, Garner had ran out of steam and the ROCKFORD FILES started becoming overshadowed by the premiere of much newer and more popular shows like the DUKES OF HAZZARD when the Dukes made their debut on CBS in the Winter 1979 which resulted in Rockford being up against The Dukes since they were both on at the same time-slot every Friday night from the Spring of 1979 till the late Fall of 1979,  along with the fact that the down-on-his-luck P.I. Jim Rockford was huffing & puffing with health problems while Bo and Luke Duke were humming along with no health issues, but NBC had briefly moved the ROCKFORD FILES to Saturdays at 10PM in February of 1979, but had changed their minds and moved Rockford back to Fridays at 9PM in April of 1979 which resulted in Rockford losing a lot of viewers through the Dukes.

Additionally, this is the season when Rockford's often irritated cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD gets promoted to lieutenant as well as the first season without my favorite character which was Rockford's foxy attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett)since Beth abruptly left the show in the 2nd half of Rockford's Fourth Season due to the fact that the inclusive Gretchen Corbett had unfortunately left the show in the Winter of 1978 due to a salary dispute over her contract with Universal leaving us mourning the loss of Beth which unfortunately gave Becker's bitter superior officer Lt. Doug Chapman(James Luisi) a.k.a. ""Chappy"" an advantage over Rockford whenever he got busted by the police since the drop-dead gorgeous Beth wasn't around to back Rockford up anymore like she did in the first 4 seasons after Beth made her last appearance in January of 1978 in ""The Attractive Nuisance"" episode, plus I also noticed that Rockford's reckless con-artist buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin) seemed to have started coming out less and less often in this season as well as the 4th and 6th Seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES and I'm just kind of surprised that Beth's departure from this private detective show didn't make the ratings go down, at least not to the point where NBC had cancelled Rockford right away or even right after completing a successful 5th Season of the ROCKFORD FILES on NBC either

It's just too bad that they didn't provide a bonus episode from the ROCKFORD FILES Sixth Season on this 1978-1979 Season DVD of Rockford like the ROCKFORD FILES-Season Four DVD had a bonus episode from the Fifth Season, by adding the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode on it, because it would've been cool if they would've at least provided one bonus episode from the 1979-80 Season of Rockford on the ROCKFORD FILES-Season Five DVD.

As a matter of fact, it would've been awesome if they would've added the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode from Rockford's 6th Season on this 1978-79 Season DVD of the ROCKFORD FILES since it was probably the best episode from the Sixth Season, just like the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode was probably the best and most intriguing episode in the Fifth Season, especially since the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode is the episode when Rockford reunites with the eccentric hot shot private investigator Lance White(Tom Selleck) at a private-eyes convention where a murder ends up taking place at leaving Rockford teaming up with the almost perfect Lance White again to solve the homicide leading Rockford to be outclassed by the impeccable Lance White again, since the goody two shoes Lance White ended up stealing the show again at Rockfords expense since the astounding Lance White ended up making all the leads and finding all the clues and being the hero again for being the private investigator who solved the case practically K.O.ing Rockford in the process, just like Lance White did in the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode, except the stellar Lance White ended up getting the trophy for being private investigator of the year in the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode, which Rockford had won originally at the beginning of that episode, which of course was before the Senators death took place there.

In addition; Rockford's Fifth Season also had some interesting guest stars in it too such as
*Tom Selleck in the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode before he was even a star which was also before his co-starring days as the Hawaiian beach-bum private detective(Thomas Magnum)on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Jerry Douglas in the ""A Good Clean Bust With Sequel Rights"" episode during his earlier co-starring days as John Abbott on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Erin Gray in the ""With The French Heel Back, Can The Nehru Jacket Be Far Behind"" episode before her co-starring days as the foxy Col. Wilma Deering on BUCK ROGERS and before her co-starring days as the foxy Kate Summers on SILVER SPOONS

*Sorrell Booke in ""The Jersey Bounce"" episode before his co-starring days as the scheming corrupt police Commissioner(J.D. ""Boss"" Hogg) on the DUKES OF HAZZARD

*Mary Frann in the episode "" Fast Count "" before her co-starring days as Joanna Louden on NEWHART

*James Sikking in the ""A Good Clean Bust With Sequel Rights"" episode before his co-starring days as Lt. Howard Hunter on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

*Carl Franklin in the ""Black Mirror"" episode before his co-starring days as the disgruntled Col. Deckers sidekick(Capt. Crane)on THE A-TEAM

*Richard Moll in the ""A 3-Day Affair With A 30-Day Escrow"" episode before his co-starring days as the tall bald baliff(Bull Shannon)on NIGHT COURT

*Dennis Holahan in ""The Battle-Ax & The Exploding Cigar"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Bo Hopkins in the episodes ""The Jersey Bounce"", ""Man Eaten By Local Newspaper"", and ""Return Of The Black Shadow"" before his co-starring days on DYNASTY

*Oscar nominee(Rita Moreno) making a recurring role in the ""Rosendahl & Gilda Stern Are Dead"" episode

*Ken Tigar in the ""Local Man Eaten By Newspaper"" episode before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES, DYNASTY, & DALLAS

*Mills Watson in ""The Deuce"" episode before his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO

*Jonathan Goldsmith in ""The Empty Frame"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Ted Schackelford in the ""Guilt"" episode before his co-starring days on KNOTT'S LANDING and on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*John Considine in the ""A Different Drummer"" episode after his co-starring days on ANOTHER WORLD

*Hector Elizondo in the ""A Good Clean Bust With Sequel Rights"" episode before his co-starring days as Dr. Philip Waters on CHICAGO HOPE

*Rene Auberjonois in the ""With The French Heel Is Back, Can The Nehru Jacket Be Far Behind"" episode before his co-starring days on BENSON

*Sharon Spelman in ""The Deuce"" episode after her co-starring days on ANGIE

*Jennifer Holmes in the episode "" Never Send A Boy King To Do A Man's Job "" before her co-starring days as Leslie on NEWHART

Unfortunately, the DUKES OF HAZZARD K.O.'d the ROCKFORD FILES in the ratings and you could say the Dukes were killing Rockford since the Dukes had outclassed Rockford big time, because for one thing Jim Rockford was outclassed by the Duke boys since Bo(John Schneider) & Luke(Tom Wopat) were both eye-candy to the ladies, plus Bo and Luke were a lot younger, a lot spunkier, more energetic, and more attractive than Rockford(James Garner)was especially since Garner was already an old-fart while Wopat and Schneider were still only young-farts just getting started in their showbiz career.

For another, the General Lee had outclassed Rockford's bronze Firebird.

For another the DUKES OF HAZZARD was a lot more hilarious than the ROCKFORD FILES was along with the fact that this show was already passed its honeymoon phase while the Dukes were just starting their honeymoon phase of the show.

Therefore you could say that John Schneider(Bo)and Tom Wopat(Luke)were peaking while James Garner(Rockford)was creaking since Rockford was getting tired and Garner had ran out of gas reaching a saturation point with his Rockford character & had gotten burned out with resuming that role which became more & more obvious since you can tell that Rockford started to limp & drag more & more in the last 2 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES as opposed to the Duke boys since Bo & Luke were full of lots of energy and steam and years ahead of them during Rockford's last 2 seasons and cancellation after NBC showed its final episode ""Deadlock In Parma"" on Thursday January 10, 1980 when the DUKES OF HAZZARD was in the middle of its 2nd Season on CBS.

Therefore you could say that the Dukes were killing Rockford, despite the fact that the ROCKFORD FILES primary reason for cancelling was due to illness, not low ratings but at the same time the DUKES OF HAZZARD easily still added fuel to fire since the Dukes basically beat Rockford to a pulp in the Nielsen ratings.

Fortunately, the ROCKFORD FILES had inspired newer private detective shows in the 80's like MAGNUM, PI which debuted on CBS in the late Fall of 1980 and SIMON & SIMON which made its debut on CBS in the mid-Fall of 1981.

So now that Universal has had Rockford's 5th Season on DVD for a while since the beginning of 2008 and since Univeral already has all 8 Seasons of MAGNUM out on DVD and Warner Bros. already has all 7 seasons of the DUKES OF HAZZARD on DVD, I can hardly wait till the ROCKFORD FILES 6th Season finally gets put on DVD, which I'm hoping will be released on DVD by the end of this year so it can at least be released in time for a X-Mas present by the end of 2008 along with the fact that Rockford's 1979-80 Season was also the last and final season of this show.

Therefore, Rockford's short-lived 1979-80 Season led us to the conclusion that Rockford had some unfinished business on the show leaving us wondering if Rockford was still making his living as a private investigator or not, but Joe Santos had later on became a part-time co-star on MAGNUM, P.I. as Magnum's cop buddy(Lt. Nolan Page)in that MAGNUM's last 2 seasons.

It was also wonderful being able to watch all these episodes of Rockford complete & uncut like they were shown on their original air-dates on NBC as opposed to how they were shown in reruns on A&E, TNN, TV Land, WGN, Me-TV, or Cozi-TV,  which all deleted too many scenes & had too many commercial disruptions.

Rockford's 5th Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBCSee Us"", which was NBC's motto from the Fall of 1978 thru the Spring of 1979 when I was still living in the unpopular Imperial Valley.

In the meantime, I've got some wonderful news for all you classic private detective drama fans out there that are underway for the Spring of 2010.

The detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 is scheduled to be released on DVD Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 is scheduled to be released on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are now both available for pre-order as we speak.",1195430400,20,11379,4.828365878725591

3004050,2,B000XJD3K2,"Unfortunately, what you get in season 5 is mostly a surly, snide Rockford, absent largely the charm and humor.  If you watch closely, Jim is absent for long spells in some episodes, perhaps worn down by the grind.  Instead of Rockford driving the action, the action happens around him.  He has his wisdom teeth removed at the start of one episode, and is incapacitated.  In another, he's beaten up by a biker gang and hospitalized.

There are some highlights, episodes Tom Sellek and Dennis Dugan make for excellent co-stars.

The season is mostly miss, with some hits.",1440547200,,569,4.814432989690721

There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion).

5 emmys the All-Time # 1 PI series. James Garner {Jim Rockford}, Noah Beery {Rocky},
Joe Santos {Dennis}, Stuart Margolin {Angel}.
Rockford always got the oddball cases that put him in tight spots; beat up often, lots of car chases, but he always managed to come out on top with his cons & routines. Co-star his Pontiac Firebird Classic Sports Car, {The Rockfordmobile}, that out-ran all the baddies. His Texas characters, printing press, and routines are classics! Began as a spin-off from Jack Webb's Adam-12, laid the groundwork for the series, with Jim in trouble with the law. (Jim, Jimbo, Jimmy) almost NEVER got paid!
Feb 2005 James Garner received the 41st Lifetime Achievement Award

Season 1 : 23 mostly great eps including 9 Classics! Season 2 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 3 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 4 : 21 mostly great eps including 14 Classics! Season 5 : 22 mostly great eps only 6 Classics though, Season 6 was a HALF SEASON CRAPPY 12 eps NOT UP TO James Garner's standard, only 2 were any good, which is partly why the show was cancelled. I DID NOT BUY SEASON 6!!!

SEASON 4 IS BY FAR THE BEST SEASON 14 / 21 eps = 67% CLASSICS!!!

It arrived within five days, which was well within their stated delivery time. Thanks for once again providing me with a great purchase.

The Rockford Files remains the best of any and all Private Eye TV Shows (which were huge in the 70's). Jim's everyday problems with paying the bills, living in a shoddy trailer by the beach & fighting with his father all make this a true TV classic. Yes, parts of the show may seem outdated to some but the same can be said of most any TV show. Anyone who is looking for witty, smart writing with believable plots should check this out! Plus numerous Hollywood stars have appeared on the show over the years. Tom Selleck starred (season six) as ""Lance White"", an upscale, handsome PI who always gets the girl, solves the case & never gets beat up. You can't go wrong with The Rockford Files!

3004256,5,B000XJD3K2,"As usual, James Garner commands the set of the 1970's TV series - Rockford Files, as Jim Rockford, a likeable, down-on-his-luck private investigator, who lives in a trailer on a beach near Los Angeles. Created by Stephen Cannell, one of the brightest minds of 70's TV, every episode includes a mystery, a car chase and a brush with the cops. And nearly always Jim Rockford solves the mystery, but ends up unpaid for his services. He usually doesn't get the girl either, but he never loses his sense of humor and there are plenty of laughs for viewers throughout each show.

This was a family favorite in the 70's and compared to the current options on the 600 plus channels I get on Satellite TV, it's far superior in writing, acting, special effects (I think that's a real Trans AM getting smashed up each episode) and way more creative and entertaining.

3004263,4,B000XJD3K2,"Just off the beach, at 29 Cove Road, Malibu, sits the trailer of private investigator Jim Rockford.  Easy going, but often a victim of hard luck, Rockford seems to specialize in unusual and offbeat cases.  Cynical and street smart, but also compassionate, Jim somehow manages to get by, with the support of his father Rocky (Noah Beery Jr.), and police buddy Dennis Becker (Joe Santos).

Roy Huggins' and Stephen J. Cannell's beloved detective and his associates are back.  While the quality of the episodes many not be uniformly great, Season Five does contain some of the best, most well-written stories in the entire series.  Many characters from past episodes are brought back, including Rita Capkovic (Rita Moreno) and Lance White (Tom Selleck).  And Stuart Margolin returns in his Emmy winning role, as Jimmy's devious ex-con pal, Evelyn ""Angel"" Martin.

Highlights from Season Five include:

The Empty Frame:  Angel is flexing his muscles at a party, treating the lovable Lt. Chapman (James Luisi) like a servant, because his brother-in-law is on the police commission.  Rockford is present, when armed robbers rip off the guests, and make off with some valuable paintings.  Jimmy is hired to recover the paintings, and in a strange twist of fate, he finds Chapman trying to court his favors.

A Good Clean Bust With Escrow Rights:  The dialog is sharp and sassy, in this superbly written episode featuring Hector Elizondo, as legendary Chicago cop Frank Falcone.  Falcone is so popular, that he has a TV based on his exploits, and an impending line of children's toys about to hit the market.  Jim is hired to provide security for the volatile celebrity, but soon finds himself mixed up in a contract hit.

Black Mirror:  This two parter features Kathryn Harrold as blind psychologist Megan Dougherty, who needs Jim's help after being threatened by a professional killer (John Pleshette).  It is a nice change of pace to see Jim happy, and starting to develop a meaningful relationship.  Garner and Harrold have great chemistry together.  Although their relationship never really developed further, Megan Dougherty would reappear again in the sixth season, and in a Rockford movie in 1996.

The Man Who Saw The Alligators:  This brilliantly written bittersweet tale, features the return of George Loros as enforcer Anthony Gagglio, fresh out of prison, and looking to do a number on Jimbo with a ball peen hammer.  Joseph Sirola is terrific as an organized crime boss, looking to keep Gagglio in line.  And Angel is at his weasely best, selling Jimmy out, and then looking to save his own skin, at a standoff at a cabin in Lake Arrowhead.

The Return Of The Black Shadow:  This season introduced Bo Hopkins as John Cooper, a disbarred lawyer who becomes Jim's legal advisor.  Jim is taking Coop's sister Gail deep sea fishing, when they become victims of ""The Rattlers"", a motorcycle gang led by quintessential scumbag Paul Koslo.  Gail is brutally gang raped, and Jim winds up in the hospital with a punctured lung.  Coop, a former member of the ""Black Shadow"" biker gang, dusts off his old ride, and hits the streets looking for the perpetrators.

A Material Difference:  Quite possibly Angel Martin's finest hour, this adventure features the squirrely one posing as a hit man, taking the front money and then fading away.  Unfortunately Angel has gotten involved with Russian spies, who don't appreciate being played for fools.  Looking to get Angel, they come after Jimmy, and the pair are soon wanted for murder, and embroiled in an effort to find out more about a mysterious secret formula.

 Never Send A Boy King To Do A Man's Job:  Running confidence schemes was something that was common in earlier days of series, but this complicated venture that stretches across two episodes, is probably the biggest scam of this type since Rockford erected an oil rig.  Dennis Dugan returns as private investigator Richie Brockleman, who is seeking Jim's help in running a big store con, after his father (Harold Gould) is cheated out of his business, by shady sports promoter Harold Jack Coombs (Robert Webber).  The ultra elaborate con features Rockford posing as ""Jimmy Joe Meeker"", a big wheel, looking to set up an exhibition tour of Egyptian artifacts, with Richie playing his assistant.  Also on the team is Odette Lependieu (Trisha Noble), impersonating a representative of the Egyptian government, and Angel manages to squeeze in on the action, overplaying his role as an expert in Egyptology.  The execution of the scheme is a thing of beauty, with just the right amount of flair, made even better by wonderfully witty dialog, in this episode written by Juanita Bartlett.

With his understated down to earth style, James Garner was simply fabulous as James Rockford.  You never forgot that Rockford was just a regular guy, with the same kind of real problems as most people.  He wasn't perfect, but he tried his best to be fair, and do what was right.  Under Stephen J Cannell's guidance, strong characterizations and consistently strong writing, with an awareness of the topics of the day, are reasons why The Rockford Files is now rightly regarded as one of the best private detective series ever.

Season Five has a few clunkers, and tries to be too cute at times, but it also hits a high number clean out of the park, with lots of great performances throughout.  This set is highly recommended to fans of the detective genre.  The subtitling is very well done.  Sadly James Garner has not contributed much in the way of extras to the Rockford DVD releases.",1276992000,2,5576,4.938775510204081

My only issue with this series of DVDs is that it's set up for 1.1:1 screen viewing.  So on my 50"" television, it only utilizes about 2/3 of the screen.",1269043200,,256,3.980392156862745
3004266,5,B000XJD3K2,"It's a wonder James Garner only won one Emmy for his portrayal of Jim Rockford.  He's so darn human it almost hurts sometimes to watch him get beat on or hoodwinked by his own friends.  That aside, season five is another great one, although we all mourn the loss of Beth Davenport.  Old friends show up: the always lucky but often clueless Lance White, Rita Kapkovich and Richie Brockelman among my favorites.  I remember Richie showing up as a summer replacement for six episodes or so.  It would be nice to have those thrown in somewhere, probably with season six since it was such a short one.

Anyway, the bottom line is nobody does do it better, or less effortlessly, than our Jimmy.  He's so natural in this character that you can't tell where one starts and the other ends.  And unlike so many other lead characters in other shows, Jimmy doesn't always win, or if he does win he doesn't necessarily benefit from it.  It's sort of like what most of us regular people go through, real life.  That's Jim.",1267660800,3,1008,4.519337016574585

3004283,5,B000XJD3K2,"Season 5 might be worth the price of admission alone for an episode entitled ""White On White and Nearly Perfect"".

In this episode, our favorite PI, our world-weary and cynical Jim Rockford is coupled with Lance White, played to perfection by Tom Selleck. While poor Jim lives and works out of a trailer, is continually stiffed by his clients for his fees and is constantly bumping heads with the LAPD and Lt. Chapman in particular, Lance White can do no wrong.

Lance's office is as big as the Taj Mahal, everybody he comes in contact with is forever in his debt, it seems, because Lance saved his / her life at one time or another and Lt. Chapman is little more than a groupie when he's around Lance.

Of course, Lance gets the girl in this episode, who just happens to be the daughter of the head of an international defense contractor and at their wedding, Lance's father-in-law announces his retirement and is turning over the company to Lance.

Jim Rockford was one of the best television characters ever created. He was a thoroughly likeable guy and you were always hoping that once, just once, poor Jim would enjoy a great payday.

But you knew that it would never come. You can't help but think of the old adage ""if I didn't have bad luck, I would have no luck at all"" when thinking about Jim Rockford.

This show ran for about 6 years (sadly with the release of season 5, we only have one more season to enjoy)and week in and week out,the writers came up with superb stories and some of the best writing around. Just listen to Rickford when somebody's giving him a hard time. Nobody - and I repeat NOBODY - came up with better comebacks than Jim Rockford. While other televsion PI's relied on toughness or connections to get the job done, Jim relied on the gift of the gab, a con and a scam. And he played them to perfection..!!

The show also enjoyed an excellent supporting cast as well - the hallmark of any great show - with characters like Rocky (his dad), Angel Martin (a sleazy ex-con who happened to be Jim's cellmate at San Quentin), Beth Davenport (Jim's lawyer), Dennis Becker (a sargeant on the LAPD and Jim's friend) and several other recurring characters.

Jim Garner is one of those guys who is just so damn likeable - in common with all of the characters he plays - and he always made it look so effortless. While some stars give off a vibe of being unapproachable, Jim Garner is one of those guys who you would feel comfortable sharing a beer with and watching a football game with.

This was a great television show and I'm so pleased that the entire series is being released as quickly and as economically as possible (unlike so many of the other cash grabs where a season is released in 2 volumes)

If you enjoyed this show 30 / 35 years ago, treat yourself to this season - and seasons one through four - and relive a great series.

You won't regret it..!",1213056000,7,2886,4.446969696969697
3004284,4,B000XJD3K2,"Viewing Rockford after all these years, I realize that my own nostalgia and an appreciation for the groundbreaking aspects of this show is much of its appeal. Pre-Rockford TV heroes typically swaggered and talked tough and never failed.  Supporting characters were shallow ""yes men/women"" who were present to make their hero look good.  Rockford, however, is surrounded by much more richly drawn and quirky characters--some true and loyal, all of them very human and many with questionable ethics and hidden agendas.  Human weakness is often an important part of the plot and, occasionally, our hero fails.  Clients lie, don't pay their bill and sometimes don't appreciate Jim's (clever and fruitful) efforts.  In other words, Jiim's life can be just a little bit like ours--and we  relate to him because of it.  It's worth watching every episode.",1210636800,11,847,5.1838235294117645

These episodes are intolerably slow in pace, and feature some of the worst acting we've seen on television - not to mention the uncharacteristic stupidity of the lead character! It's almost like Rockford suffered amnesia, and along with losing his memories, lost his skills and wisdom as well...

We pre-ordered this set, and have ended up reluctantly forcing ourselves to watch individual episodes, where previously with the other seasons, we would gobble up multiple episodes at once...

This season leaves a very bad taste in the mouth for two big fans.

3238450,5,B000XJD3K2,The Rockford Files season 5 on DVD is definitely worth it.  I believe this was the best detective show ever on TV.  James Garner as Jim Rockford was the everyman's detective.  I can hardly wait for season 6 and then the Rockford Files movies to be available on DVD.,1202428800,6,265,4.36734693877551
3238451,4,B000XJD3K2,"I have to say, it's hard to rate Season 5 any less than the previous four seasons on DVD, but because it's missing Beth, and seems not to have nearly enough Angel, I guess I can take one star away. Still, I believe this may be my favorite detective series.  James Garner is completely believable and natural as the laid back detective. He brings a self-depricating, anti-hero charm to Jim, not a coward, just smart enough to know that you can't dodge a bullet when the gun is pointed at your chest.

Since it's more the same of what I love, I guess I'm wondering what will happen with Season 6, which was only half over when Garner had to leave for health reasons.  I'd like to suggest that it would be nice if Universal combined Season 6 with the movie length comeback of the Rockford files of the 90's.

Video quality is not remastered for high-def, but that shouldn't matter, since what we're dealing with here are studio masters, which were printed on giant tape sets for broadcasting in the 70's.  The quality is really no better or worse than the previous DVD releases - in fact, it's basically what they probably looked like when they debuted originally, and that is part of their charm - so don't let that stop you from purchasing this very entertaining collection.",1202342400,16,1273,4.541484716157205
3238452,3,B000XJD3K2,"Overall, a pretty dreary collection, especially in comparison to the first four magnificent years. In Season Five, there is no Beth Davenport, minimal Angel Martin, and almost half the episodes are clinkers: ""Empty Frame""(Berkeley revolutionaries hijacking a Pacific Palisades art collection? In 1978??); ""Three-Day Affair""; ""Black Mirror""; ""Local Man Eaten""; ""Nehru Jacket""(bottom of the barrel); ""Battle Ax""; ""Guilt""; ""Material Difference""; ""Different Drummer"".

Of course, there are good things too. John Cooper(who should've been given more time). The emergence of Lt. Chapman. But for me the saving grace of the whole year and worth the price of the DVD set is the uncut ""Man Who Saw the Alligators"".

Originally a 74-minute episode(as it is here), but always shown in syndication in 48-minute form, this classic Rockford was written by David Chase, obviously warming up for ""The Sopranos"". Yes, the role of Momma Gagglio is rather annoying, either because of actress Penny Santon or because of Corey Allen's direction of her(at times, she is low-key and complex, so perhaps it was Allen). Other than that, all the new footage is great. We see the decision by Anthony Boy's mom to allow her own son's murder, and this deepens everything, particularly George Loros's wonderful performance as the son. (As it does Joey Aresco as brother Richie.) The road trip stuff between Anthony & Syl is tough and funny. But the real highlight is Joe Sirola, who steals the show. Sirola is a legendary character actor, and has never been better than he is here. Instead of spinning off that silly Richie Brockleman, Cannell & Co. should have created a new show based on Joseph Minnette. (In a way I guess David Chase did just that.) All this really does make 48 minutes which were already classic Rockford into something very special.",1202083200,23,1824,5.117449664429531
3238453,5,B000XJD3K2,"""The Rockford Files"" was a wildly popular, and now, iconographic, television detective series based on the life and work of Jim Rockford, a private detective living in southern California in the 1970's. The series is undoubtedly one of the best television shows ever produced: so good that one almost winces when the word ""television"" is mentioned in context with the show. Although television was the format and forum for the series, the work lays clearly outside the norms of ""good television,"" and moves into areas generally only found in film and drama.

Jim is a genuinely good-hearted, but nevertheless cynical, hero of the common man who makes his sometimes meager income pursuing his unusual and often dangerous job. As an ex-con himself who spent time in jail for a crime he did not commit (and for which he eventually received a full pardon), Jim's street smarts equip him to move through all types of dangerous and unexpectedly dramatic situations that arise as he works his way through his revolving caseload, the ""files"" part of ""The Rockford Files."" Jim's response to questions about his daily rate, usually asked by someone in most every episode, is ""200 dollars a day, plus expenses."" Jim's duties might be to look for a missing person, collect on a debt owed, solve a crime, or anything else that someone might hire a private detective to do.

Jim makes frequent use of his friend in Los Angeles Police Department, Sgt. Dennis Becker, to get important information, but as often as not, pays the favors back by providing help to Becker which allowed Becker to make arrests. Jim claims to be averse to picking up any job that involves real danger. He owns a gun, but rarely uses it, and makes a point of telling anyone who will listen that he doesn't like guns. Nevertheless, it is Jim's care for the individual that generally moves him into danger to help someone else in need. His closest real friend, Angel Martin, is a small-time grifter and con artist who is always trying to con someone out of a few dollars, but never manages to lose Jim's friendship for reasons that may rest more with Jim's sense of responsibility to a person who needs SOMEONE to care for him than for more selfish reasons.

Jim's gold Pontiac Firebird became one of the enduring visual representations of the decade. The car was routinely bruised, dinged, crashed, vandalized, and in one episode, even blown up, but was nevertheless kept in steady repair throughout the entire run of the series. Few automobiles have been so closely identified with a dramatic character while never being the central focus of attention.

The Rockford Files was well-known for extremely strong plot lines, with virtually every episode in the run of the series an outstanding piece of dramatic writing and acting set to full musical score. The music in the first season or two is often exceptionally strong, where we often discover entire episodes seemingly a continuous musical score underpinning the story. (The theme song for the series, played at the beginning of every episode and revisted within episodes as variations on a theme, was immensely popular during the series run, and was catchy enought to be released commercially on the radio waves at some point in the show's run.) Individual episodes focus on a variety of themes, either comic, intrigue, mystery, problem solving, and others, but the common thread in them all is life as viewed through the lens and experiences of Jim's efforts to stay out of trouble while he faces trouble. Episodes typically contains enough twists and turns to keep even the most seasoned watcher on the edge of the seat in trying to figure out the angle or angles that are at play. The commanding and reassuring presence of James Garner, a greatly-loved figure in American movies and television, carries virtually every scene while keeping the plot believable and engaging. The fact that the series could maintain such high levels of realistic credibility while not allowing the viewer to assemble all the pieces until the near end of each episode is simply a marvel of narrative storytelling. These are some of the best examples of premier storytelling in the history of television, and arguably, film.

Many reviews of television shows contain lists of ""best"" episodes. In my own mind, it is simply not possible to create such a list for The Rockford Files. To do so would perhaps do some injustice to the series, because virtually every episode is ""good"" in the basic sense. Yes, there are indeed some episodes that are archetypical examples of mastery in video storytelling, but to be perfectly honest, you can basically pick any episode of The Rockford Files at random, and, assuming you understand the basic premise of the show, chances are you'll have a great viewing experience. But perhaps this is a series best watched by starting with Season One, and watching each episode in order, so that one can fully appreciate the cast of characters, their relationship to one another, and the unfolding story of Jim's life. Along the way, we come to love Rocky as a father and human being, appreciate Denis as an honest and hard-working police officer, admire Beth as a skilled and knowledgeable lawyer, and feel some level of understanding, and yes, even sympathy, for Angel as he cons his way through small-time scams. Running through it all is Jim, a person who often puts others above himself, and has a touch of humanity that appeals to most everyone, and easily makes the series one of the most endearing to ever appear on television.",1200528000,40,5557,4.88865323435843
3238454,5,B000XJD3K2,"My only gripe as a fan since the late 70's was not including any bonuses. Season 6 was an abbreviated season where Garner's stunts and age caught up to him plus declining ratings due to new 1979 shows like Dukes of Hazzard led to its cancellation. This is the last complete season of the series here and is a must own for any fans. I enjoy the later seasons with ""Chappy"".. he brought more emotion to viewers making life difficult for Jim and Becker.",1200441600,2,450,4.369047619047619
3238455,5,B000XJD3K2,"The Rockford Files, in case you haven't seen it, is one of the best examples of dramatic television in the 1970's (if you have seen it you already know that).  The Rockford Files was/is a witty, well written ""detective"" show, a genre that was extremely popular in the 70's and 80's.  If you like Magnum P.I. or Simon and Simon or any other show like that then you'll like The Rockford Files.  Rockford did the same thing before they did it, only better.

James Garner was absolutely perfect as Jim Rockford.  It's just about impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  The show's writers and producers managed to find a perfect balance of drama and comedy (with the comedy coming in the form of dry, sarcastic one liners, usually coming from Rockford) without hurting the dramatic impact of the stories.

The fifth season of the show found those writers and producers on a roll.  The Rockford Files was one of those shows that never saw a slip in quality.  It was a great show from start to finish.  And now nearly the entire run of the series is available on DVD.

Watching the DVD's is almost like going back in time - these episodes (for the most part) haven't looked this good since they first aired back in the 70's.  It's nice, too, to be able to watch uncut episodes (as a couple minutes from each episode of shows from that era are cut for additional ad time when shown on TV in syndication).  Unless you watched the shows in the 70's you might not even know what you were missing when watching the shows in syndication - but now you will get to see those scenes previously deleted for commercial time.

Oh and don't forget ""At the tone leave your name and number, I'll get back to you.""",1196380800,88,2114,4.917613636363637
3238457,4,B000XJD3K2,"I think this 1978-79 Season of this detective drama was the best and probably the most successful season of them all throughout Rockford's whole 6-year run on NBC along with the fact that this was also the last full season of the ROCKFORD FILES since Rockford's 6th Season was only a half season since this private detective drama was cut short when it was abruptly cancelled in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner developing health problems.

Therefore, Garner had ran out of steam and the ROCKFORD FILES started becoming overshadowed by the premiere of much newer and more popular shows like the DUKES OF HAZZARD when the Dukes made their debut on CBS in the Winter 1979 which resulted in Rockford being up against The Dukes since they were both on at the same time-slot every Friday night from the Spring of 1979 till the late Fall of 1979,  along with the fact that the down-on-his-luck P.I. Jim Rockford was huffing & puffing with health problems while Bo and Luke Duke were humming along with no health issues, but NBC had briefly moved the ROCKFORD FILES to Saturdays at 10PM in February of 1979, but had changed their minds and moved Rockford back to Fridays at 9PM in April of 1979 which resulted in Rockford losing a lot of viewers through the Dukes.

Additionally, this is the season when Rockford's often irritated cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD gets promoted to lieutenant as well as the first season without my favorite character which was Rockford's foxy attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett)since Beth abruptly left the show in the 2nd half of Rockford's Fourth Season due to the fact that the inclusive Gretchen Corbett had unfortunately left the show in the Winter of 1978 due to a salary dispute over her contract with Universal leaving us mourning the loss of Beth which unfortunately gave Becker's bitter superior officer Lt. Doug Chapman(James Luisi) a.k.a. ""Chappy"" an advantage over Rockford whenever he got busted by the police since the drop-dead gorgeous Beth wasn't around to back Rockford up anymore like she did in the first 4 seasons after Beth made her last appearance in January of 1978 in ""The Attractive Nuisance"" episode, plus I also noticed that Rockford's reckless con-artist buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin) seemed to have started coming out less and less often in this season as well as the 4th and 6th Seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES and I'm just kind of surprised that Beth's departure from this private detective show didn't make the ratings go down, at least not to the point where NBC had cancelled Rockford right away or even right after completing a successful 5th Season of the ROCKFORD FILES on NBC either

It's just too bad that they didn't provide a bonus episode from the ROCKFORD FILES Sixth Season on this 1978-1979 Season DVD of Rockford like the ROCKFORD FILES-Season Four DVD had a bonus episode from the Fifth Season, by adding the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode on it, because it would've been cool if they would've at least provided one bonus episode from the 1979-80 Season of Rockford on the ROCKFORD FILES-Season Five DVD.

As a matter of fact, it would've been awesome if they would've added the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode from Rockford's 6th Season on this 1978-79 Season DVD of the ROCKFORD FILES since it was probably the best episode from the Sixth Season, just like the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode was probably the best and most intriguing episode in the Fifth Season, especially since the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode is the episode when Rockford reunites with the eccentric hot shot private investigator Lance White(Tom Selleck) at a private-eyes convention where a murder ends up taking place at leaving Rockford teaming up with the almost perfect Lance White again to solve the homicide leading Rockford to be outclassed by the impeccable Lance White again, since the goody two shoes Lance White ended up stealing the show again at Rockfords expense since the astounding Lance White ended up making all the leads and finding all the clues and being the hero again for being the private investigator who solved the case practically K.O.ing Rockford in the process, just like Lance White did in the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode, except the stellar Lance White ended up getting the trophy for being private investigator of the year in the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode, which Rockford had won originally at the beginning of that episode, which of course was before the Senators death took place there.

In addition; Rockford's Fifth Season also had some interesting guest stars in it too such as
*Tom Selleck in the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode before he was even a star which was also before his co-starring days as the Hawaiian beach-bum private detective(Thomas Magnum)on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Jerry Douglas in the ""A Good Clean Bust With Sequel Rights"" episode during his earlier co-starring days as John Abbott on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Erin Gray in the ""With The French Heel Back, Can The Nehru Jacket Be Far Behind"" episode before her co-starring days as the foxy Col. Wilma Deering on BUCK ROGERS and before her co-starring days as the foxy Kate Summers on SILVER SPOONS

*Sorrell Booke in ""The Jersey Bounce"" episode before his co-starring days as the scheming corrupt police Commissioner(J.D. ""Boss"" Hogg) on the DUKES OF HAZZARD

*Mary Frann in the episode "" Fast Count "" before her co-starring days as Joanna Louden on NEWHART

*James Sikking in the ""A Good Clean Bust With Sequel Rights"" episode before his co-starring days as Lt. Howard Hunter on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

*Carl Franklin in the ""Black Mirror"" episode before his co-starring days as the disgruntled Col. Deckers sidekick(Capt. Crane)on THE A-TEAM

*Richard Moll in the ""A 3-Day Affair With A 30-Day Escrow"" episode before his co-starring days as the tall bald baliff(Bull Shannon)on NIGHT COURT

*Dennis Holahan in ""The Battle-Ax & The Exploding Cigar"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Bo Hopkins in the episodes ""The Jersey Bounce"", ""Man Eaten By Local Newspaper"", and ""Return Of The Black Shadow"" before his co-starring days on DYNASTY

*Oscar nominee(Rita Moreno) making a recurring role in the ""Rosendahl & Gilda Stern Are Dead"" episode

*Ken Tigar in the ""Local Man Eaten By Newspaper"" episode before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES, DYNASTY, & DALLAS

*Mills Watson in ""The Deuce"" episode before his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO

*Jonathan Goldsmith in ""The Empty Frame"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Ted Schackelford in the ""Guilt"" episode before his co-starring days on KNOTT'S LANDING and on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*John Considine in the ""A Different Drummer"" episode after his co-starring days on ANOTHER WORLD

*Hector Elizondo in the ""A Good Clean Bust With Sequel Rights"" episode before his co-starring days as Dr. Philip Waters on CHICAGO HOPE

*Rene Auberjonois in the ""With The French Heel Is Back, Can The Nehru Jacket Be Far Behind"" episode before his co-starring days on BENSON

*Sharon Spelman in ""The Deuce"" episode after her co-starring days on ANGIE

*Jennifer Holmes in the episode "" Never Send A Boy King To Do A Man's Job "" before her co-starring days as Leslie on NEWHART

Unfortunately, the DUKES OF HAZZARD K.O.'d the ROCKFORD FILES in the ratings and you could say the Dukes were killing Rockford since the Dukes had outclassed Rockford big time, because for one thing Jim Rockford was outclassed by the Duke boys since Bo(John Schneider) & Luke(Tom Wopat) were both eye-candy to the ladies, plus Bo and Luke were a lot younger, a lot spunkier, more energetic, and more attractive than Rockford(James Garner)was especially since Garner was already an old-fart while Wopat and Schneider were still only young-farts just getting started in their showbiz career.

For another, the General Lee had outclassed Rockford's bronze Firebird.

For another the DUKES OF HAZZARD was a lot more hilarious than the ROCKFORD FILES was along with the fact that this show was already passed its honeymoon phase while the Dukes were just starting their honeymoon phase of the show.

Therefore you could say that John Schneider(Bo)and Tom Wopat(Luke)were peaking while James Garner(Rockford)was creaking since Rockford was getting tired and Garner had ran out of gas reaching a saturation point with his Rockford character & had gotten burned out with resuming that role which became more & more obvious since you can tell that Rockford started to limp & drag more & more in the last 2 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES as opposed to the Duke boys since Bo & Luke were full of lots of energy and steam and years ahead of them during Rockford's last 2 seasons and cancellation after NBC showed its final episode ""Deadlock In Parma"" on Thursday January 10, 1980 when the DUKES OF HAZZARD was in the middle of its 2nd Season on CBS.

Therefore you could say that the Dukes were killing Rockford, despite the fact that the ROCKFORD FILES primary reason for cancelling was due to illness, not low ratings but at the same time the DUKES OF HAZZARD easily still added fuel to fire since the Dukes basically beat Rockford to a pulp in the Nielsen ratings.

Fortunately, the ROCKFORD FILES had inspired newer private detective shows in the 80's like MAGNUM, PI which debuted on CBS in the late Fall of 1980 and SIMON & SIMON which made its debut on CBS in the mid-Fall of 1981.

So now that Universal has had Rockford's 5th Season on DVD for a while since the beginning of 2008 and since Univeral already has all 8 Seasons of MAGNUM out on DVD and Warner Bros. already has all 7 seasons of the DUKES OF HAZZARD on DVD, I can hardly wait till the ROCKFORD FILES 6th Season finally gets put on DVD, which I'm hoping will be released on DVD by the end of this year so it can at least be released in time for a X-Mas present by the end of 2008 along with the fact that Rockford's 1979-80 Season was also the last and final season of this show.

Therefore, Rockford's short-lived 1979-80 Season led us to the conclusion that Rockford had some unfinished business on the show leaving us wondering if Rockford was still making his living as a private investigator or not, but Joe Santos had later on became a part-time co-star on MAGNUM, P.I. as Magnum's cop buddy(Lt. Nolan Page)in that MAGNUM's last 2 seasons.

It was also wonderful being able to watch all these episodes of Rockford complete & uncut like they were shown on their original air-dates on NBC as opposed to how they were shown in reruns on A&E, TNN, TV Land, WGN, Me-TV, or Cozi-TV,  which all deleted too many scenes & had too many commercial disruptions.

Rockford's 5th Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBCSee Us"", which was NBC's motto from the Fall of 1978 thru the Spring of 1979 when I was still living in the unpopular Imperial Valley.

In the meantime, I've got some wonderful news for all you classic private detective drama fans out there that are underway for the Spring of 2010.

The detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 is scheduled to be released on DVD Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 is scheduled to be released on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are now both available for pre-order as we speak.",1195430400,20,11379,4.828365878725591

He has his wisdom teeth removed at the start of one episode, and is incapacitated.  In another, he's beaten up by a biker gang and hospitalized.

There are some highlights, episodes Tom Sellek and Dennis Dugan make for excellent co-stars.

The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion).

Co-star his Pontiac Firebird Classic Sports Car, {The Rockfordmobile}, that out-ran all the baddies. His Texas characters, printing press, and routines are classics! Began as a spin-off from Jack Webb's Adam-12, laid the groundwork for the series, with Jim in trouble with the law. (Jim, Jimbo, Jimmy) almost NEVER got paid!
Feb 2005 James Garner received the 41st Lifetime Achievement Award

It arrived within five days, which was well within their stated delivery time. Thanks for once again providing me with a great purchase.

The Rockford Files remains the best of any and all Private Eye TV Shows (which were huge in the 70's). Jim's everyday problems with paying the bills, living in a shoddy trailer by the beach & fighting with his father all make this a true TV classic. Yes, parts of the show may seem outdated to some but the same can be said of most any TV show. Anyone who is looking for witty, smart writing with believable plots should check this out! Plus numerous Hollywood stars have appeared on the show over the years. Tom Selleck starred (season six) as ""Lance White"", an upscale, handsome PI who always gets the girl, solves the case & never gets beat up. You can't go wrong with The Rockford Files!

3238753,5,B000XJD3K2,"As usual, James Garner commands the set of the 1970's TV series - Rockford Files, as Jim Rockford, a likeable, down-on-his-luck private investigator, who lives in a trailer on a beach near Los Angeles. Created by Stephen Cannell, one of the brightest minds of 70's TV, every episode includes a mystery, a car chase and a brush with the cops. And nearly always Jim Rockford solves the mystery, but ends up unpaid for his services. He usually doesn't get the girl either, but he never loses his sense of humor and there are plenty of laughs for viewers throughout each show.

This was a family favorite in the 70's and compared to the current options on the 600 plus channels I get on Satellite TV, it's far superior in writing, acting, special effects (I think that's a real Trans AM getting smashed up each episode) and way more creative and entertaining.

3238760,4,B000XJD3K2,"Just off the beach, at 29 Cove Road, Malibu, sits the trailer of private investigator Jim Rockford.  Easy going, but often a victim of hard luck, Rockford seems to specialize in unusual and offbeat cases.  Cynical and street smart, but also compassionate, Jim somehow manages to get by, with the support of his father Rocky (Noah Beery Jr.), and police buddy Dennis Becker (Joe Santos).

Roy Huggins' and Stephen J. Cannell's beloved detective and his associates are back.  While the quality of the episodes many not be uniformly great, Season Five does contain some of the best, most well-written stories in the entire series.  Many characters from past episodes are brought back, including Rita Capkovic (Rita Moreno) and Lance White (Tom Selleck).  And Stuart Margolin returns in his Emmy winning role, as Jimmy's devious ex-con pal, Evelyn ""Angel"" Martin.

Highlights from Season Five include:

The Empty Frame:  Angel is flexing his muscles at a party, treating the lovable Lt. Chapman (James Luisi) like a servant, because his brother-in-law is on the police commission.  Rockford is present, when armed robbers rip off the guests, and make off with some valuable paintings.  Jimmy is hired to recover the paintings, and in a strange twist of fate, he finds Chapman trying to court his favors.

A Good Clean Bust With Escrow Rights:  The dialog is sharp and sassy, in this superbly written episode featuring Hector Elizondo, as legendary Chicago cop Frank Falcone.  Falcone is so popular, that he has a TV based on his exploits, and an impending line of children's toys about to hit the market.  Jim is hired to provide security for the volatile celebrity, but soon finds himself mixed up in a contract hit.

Black Mirror:  This two parter features Kathryn Harrold as blind psychologist Megan Dougherty, who needs Jim's help after being threatened by a professional killer (John Pleshette).  It is a nice change of pace to see Jim happy, and starting to develop a meaningful relationship.  Garner and Harrold have great chemistry together.  Although their relationship never really developed further, Megan Dougherty would reappear again in the sixth season, and in a Rockford movie in 1996.

The Man Who Saw The Alligators:  This brilliantly written bittersweet tale, features the return of George Loros as enforcer Anthony Gagglio, fresh out of prison, and looking to do a number on Jimbo with a ball peen hammer.  Joseph Sirola is terrific as an organized crime boss, looking to keep Gagglio in line.  And Angel is at his weasely best, selling Jimmy out, and then looking to save his own skin, at a standoff at a cabin in Lake Arrowhead.

The Return Of The Black Shadow:  This season introduced Bo Hopkins as John Cooper, a disbarred lawyer who becomes Jim's legal advisor.  Jim is taking Coop's sister Gail deep sea fishing, when they become victims of ""The Rattlers"", a motorcycle gang led by quintessential scumbag Paul Koslo.  Gail is brutally gang raped, and Jim winds up in the hospital with a punctured lung.  Coop, a former member of the ""Black Shadow"" biker gang, dusts off his old ride, and hits the streets looking for the perpetrators.

A Material Difference:  Quite possibly Angel Martin's finest hour, this adventure features the squirrely one posing as a hit man, taking the front money and then fading away.  Unfortunately Angel has gotten involved with Russian spies, who don't appreciate being played for fools.  Looking to get Angel, they come after Jimmy, and the pair are soon wanted for murder, and embroiled in an effort to find out more about a mysterious secret formula.

 Never Send A Boy King To Do A Man's Job:  Running confidence schemes was something that was common in earlier days of series, but this complicated venture that stretches across two episodes, is probably the biggest scam of this type since Rockford erected an oil rig.  Dennis Dugan returns as private investigator Richie Brockleman, who is seeking Jim's help in running a big store con, after his father (Harold Gould) is cheated out of his business, by shady sports promoter Harold Jack Coombs (Robert Webber).  The ultra elaborate con features Rockford posing as ""Jimmy Joe Meeker"", a big wheel, looking to set up an exhibition tour of Egyptian artifacts, with Richie playing his assistant.  Also on the team is Odette Lependieu (Trisha Noble), impersonating a representative of the Egyptian government, and Angel manages to squeeze in on the action, overplaying his role as an expert in Egyptology.  The execution of the scheme is a thing of beauty, with just the right amount of flair, made even better by wonderfully witty dialog, in this episode written by Juanita Bartlett.

With his understated down to earth style, James Garner was simply fabulous as James Rockford.  You never forgot that Rockford was just a regular guy, with the same kind of real problems as most people.  He wasn't perfect, but he tried his best to be fair, and do what was right.  Under Stephen J Cannell's guidance, strong characterizations and consistently strong writing, with an awareness of the topics of the day, are reasons why The Rockford Files is now rightly regarded as one of the best private detective series ever.

Season Five has a few clunkers, and tries to be too cute at times, but it also hits a high number clean out of the park, with lots of great performances throughout.  This set is highly recommended to fans of the detective genre.  The subtitling is very well done.  Sadly James Garner has not contributed much in the way of extras to the Rockford DVD releases.",1276992000,2,5576,4.938775510204081

My only issue with this series of DVDs is that it's set up for 1.1:1 screen viewing.  So on my 50"" television, it only utilizes about 2/3 of the screen.",1269043200,,256,3.980392156862745
3238763,5,B000XJD3K2,"It's a wonder James Garner only won one Emmy for his portrayal of Jim Rockford.  He's so darn human it almost hurts sometimes to watch him get beat on or hoodwinked by his own friends.  That aside, season five is another great one, although we all mourn the loss of Beth Davenport.  Old friends show up: the always lucky but often clueless Lance White, Rita Kapkovich and Richie Brockelman among my favorites.  I remember Richie showing up as a summer replacement for six episodes or so.  It would be nice to have those thrown in somewhere, probably with season six since it was such a short one.

Anyway, the bottom line is nobody does do it better, or less effortlessly, than our Jimmy.  He's so natural in this character that you can't tell where one starts and the other ends.  And unlike so many other lead characters in other shows, Jimmy doesn't always win, or if he does win he doesn't necessarily benefit from it.  It's sort of like what most of us regular people go through, real life.  That's Jim.",1267660800,3,1008,4.519337016574585

3238780,5,B000XJD3K2,"Season 5 might be worth the price of admission alone for an episode entitled ""White On White and Nearly Perfect"".

In this episode, our favorite PI, our world-weary and cynical Jim Rockford is coupled with Lance White, played to perfection by Tom Selleck. While poor Jim lives and works out of a trailer, is continually stiffed by his clients for his fees and is constantly bumping heads with the LAPD and Lt. Chapman in particular, Lance White can do no wrong.

Lance's office is as big as the Taj Mahal, everybody he comes in contact with is forever in his debt, it seems, because Lance saved his / her life at one time or another and Lt. Chapman is little more than a groupie when he's around Lance.

Of course, Lance gets the girl in this episode, who just happens to be the daughter of the head of an international defense contractor and at their wedding, Lance's father-in-law announces his retirement and is turning over the company to Lance.

Jim Rockford was one of the best television characters ever created. He was a thoroughly likeable guy and you were always hoping that once, just once, poor Jim would enjoy a great payday.

But you knew that it would never come. You can't help but think of the old adage ""if I didn't have bad luck, I would have no luck at all"" when thinking about Jim Rockford.

This show ran for about 6 years (sadly with the release of season 5, we only have one more season to enjoy)and week in and week out,the writers came up with superb stories and some of the best writing around. Just listen to Rickford when somebody's giving him a hard time. Nobody - and I repeat NOBODY - came up with better comebacks than Jim Rockford. While other televsion PI's relied on toughness or connections to get the job done, Jim relied on the gift of the gab, a con and a scam. And he played them to perfection..!!

The show also enjoyed an excellent supporting cast as well - the hallmark of any great show - with characters like Rocky (his dad), Angel Martin (a sleazy ex-con who happened to be Jim's cellmate at San Quentin), Beth Davenport (Jim's lawyer), Dennis Becker (a sargeant on the LAPD and Jim's friend) and several other recurring characters.

Jim Garner is one of those guys who is just so damn likeable - in common with all of the characters he plays - and he always made it look so effortless. While some stars give off a vibe of being unapproachable, Jim Garner is one of those guys who you would feel comfortable sharing a beer with and watching a football game with.

This was a great television show and I'm so pleased that the entire series is being released as quickly and as economically as possible (unlike so many of the other cash grabs where a season is released in 2 volumes)

If you enjoyed this show 30 / 35 years ago, treat yourself to this season - and seasons one through four - and relive a great series.

Pre-Rockford TV heroes typically swaggered and talked tough and never failed.  Supporting characters were shallow ""yes men/women"" who were present to make their hero look good.  Rockford, however, is surrounded by much more richly drawn and quirky characters--some true and loyal, all of them very human and many with questionable ethics and hidden agendas.  Human weakness is often an important part of the plot and, occasionally, our hero fails.  Clients lie, don't pay their bill and sometimes don't appreciate Jim's (clever and fruitful) efforts.  In other words, Jiim's life can be just a little bit like ours--and we  relate to him because of it.  It's worth watching every episode.",1210636800,11,847,5.1838235294117645
3238782,2,B000XJD3K2,"We were eagerly awaiting the release of season 5 after really enjoying the first four, but WOW, what a disappointment...

These episodes are intolerably slow in pace, and feature some of the worst acting we've seen on television - not to mention the uncharacteristic stupidity of the lead character! It's almost like Rockford suffered amnesia, and along with losing his memories, lost his skills and wisdom as well...

We pre-ordered this set, and have ended up reluctantly forcing ourselves to watch individual episodes, where previously with the other seasons, we would gobble up multiple episodes at once...

This season leaves a very bad taste in the mouth for two big fans.

Time to go watch the earlier episodes again!",1208131200,5,724,5.0588235294117645
3238783,5,B000XJD3K2,"The moment you hear the theme song to Rockford Files you are compelled to leave whatever you are doing and come watch.  Once you get the hang of the menu selections (done in picture format instead of title) it is easy to navigate around the DVD.  Watching the shows brings back a lot of memories and reinforces what great TV is all about.

It's the Rockford Files, one of the best.  Perry Mason in the late '50's, early '60's.  Rockford for the '70's.  My favorite episode in this pack is ""Never Send a Boy King to Do a Man's Job"" a two-parter that is an elaborate revenge scam.",1204156800,2,412,4.5
