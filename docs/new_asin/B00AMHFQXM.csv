5451126,4,B00AMHFQXM,"I first became aware of Mr. Files in a rather circuitous manner.  I've lived in Tucson, AZ since the mid 60's and lore of the underworld here has always been rich.  As a young man, I worked on a place called Grace Ranch, and had occasion meet and speak with a gentleman, Mr. Licovoli on many occasions.  Years later, thru an internet search for information on the ranch, I found Bob Vernons' original website regarding Mr. Files.  Fascinating! This was odd, as I had also followed a lawsuit to exhume the body of our late President, brought by  an investigator named Joe West before his passing, who Bob was hence connected to.

I have read the transcripts of this project many times, since shortly after it was available long ago.  The 'Rabbits Hole' that this can lead you to is an endeavor you should enter at your own risk (lol).

I feel that Mr. Files represents a very frank and interesting look at that day in November from an obviously unique perspective.  By that I mean, what I find most intriguing is that, well, no one has dared to make such a detailed claim of this sort, until this man did.  Why not bend an ear?

So much discovery has been made about that day in Dallas and the following events over the 50 years since.  Thanks to the internet, technology, individuals speaking out, and probably most of all - the 'Freedom Of Information Act,' much of what Mr. Files claims or eludes to, is being or has been corroborated or supported by statements or documents unrelated to this.

Is this all fact ?  That as well as so much else, simply can't be known.  Is it worth reading/hearing?  Extremely so!  Too many offerings, and reviewers come from a blatant predetermined bias that if it sheds doubt on, or speaks poorly of the WCR, it must be bunk!  Our government wouldn't, couldn't ever lie to us like that!  I simply say it is worth the purchase because it allows you to THINK !  Everything brought to light since that day IS relevant and worth consideration.

After all .... remember the mess caused when someone told a little white lie about WMDs ?  It can happen!  THINK.",1373500800,3,2090,4.5
5451127,2,B00AMHFQXM,"*See this footnote if you are familiar with JFK research enough to know Oswald was just a patsy.

If you are new to JFK assassination research, do not start here. For videos, check out Mark Lane's ""Rush to Judgment"" and the 9-part series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"". Both are probably only available on Youtube. Reading a highly rated book or two about the verified facts of the JFK assassination would also be a good idea.

And then, if you are still interested in the truth, you ought to check out this DVD and its companion book. I bought them both but I do not think they are worth it. I suggest borrowing them. Having them in your library does not seem necessary at this time.

The DVD and book are just as likely to be an elaborate hoax as genuine. And there is absolutely nothing new or revealing of any relevance. And THAT is the biggest red flag -- of many red flags that go up when you view this alleged interview with a confessed JFK assassin.

The alias James E. Files alone is suspicious. Verifiable criminals do not choose pseudonyms that are unique or overly memorable. ""James E. Files"" is way too conspicuous a name. It's totally memorable and stands out in any list of names as unusual and possibly unique. Everything that ""Files"" says of pertinence can be found elsewhere and he uses wording that is way too similar to that of popularly referenced sources.

For instance, he seems to go out of his way to corroborate minor details of certain foundational eyewitness testimony such as that of Holland, Dodd and Bowers regarding footprints in the mud, mud on the fence and cigarette butts. It seems like he read their testimony before giving his.

His seeming ""defense"" of the exotic rifle and ammunition he claimed to have used lacks any new information about either. In other words, he does not discuss any details about the gun and ""mercury bullet"" that cannot be found in other sources. Anyone who does some research into the types of guns and ammunition that might have been used by an assassin in 1963 would be able to come up with the claims about the gun and ammo as accurate as this guy calling himself ""James E. Files"".

The possibly unique or new information that ""Files"" provides is the sort that cannot be verified and which seems to have been chosen to lend a sort of folksy credibility such as complaining about contaminated drinking water at the prison or a particular mobster's personality and predilections for the kinds of people they prefer to kill or not to kill.

He says Oswald was a quiet guy who was intelligent although he didn't speak much at all as he spent several hours with ""Files"". Meh. That kind of ""information"" is unverifiable and can be deduced from widely known accounts of Oswald's personality and character.

His claimed firing position is poorly supported by other evidence. His insistence that no one else was with him behind the fence and that he was unaware of any other shooters in that area is very troubling. He has a cavalier attitude about not knowing crucial, even life-threatening information. If or how his position would be concealed and how his escape would be ensured is unclear.

The poor quality of both the DVD and book do not help its credibility.

It may all be true but I would not bet on it. And if this is an elaborate hoax, it will set back the cause of exposing the truth -- but not as much as hoaxers might believe.

There is so much irrefutable evidence proving at least one and probably two or three assassins were shooting from behind the picket fence that whether or not James E. Files is legitimate is largely irrelevant. The overwhelming amount of conclusive evidence is both the most powerful reason for questioning the credibility of this guy and the exact same reason exposure as a hoax would cause far less damage than the hoaxers would think.

The confession of James E. Files is not needed and not helpful to either those who wish to disprove it or those who want to prove it.
___________________________________
*Sherry Fiester, author of ""Enemy of the Truth"", and other competent researchers have definitively ruled out the firing location of the fatal headshot as originating from behind the fence where the fraudster ""James E. Files"" claims to have shot JFK. The fraudster chose to tell a story about him being ""the gunman on the grassy knoll"" because at the time he did his research it was the most popular hypothesis. We now have access to published analyses by competent experts such as Sherry Fiester that proves the fatal headshot was fired from an underpass location -- not from the ""grassy knoll"". Thereby invalidating the fabrication being spun by ""James E. Files"". If James Sutton aka ""James E. Files"" did his prison library/internet research on JFK's assassination today he would claim he was the underpass shooter. As one of his prison wardens said, ""He's ten times smart"".",1372982400,14,4882,4.702576112412178
5451128,3,B00AMHFQXM,"I've done so much research on the JFK assassination, and it seems the more I do, the more confused I become.  I am afraid that too much time has passed and at this point anybody could come forward and say they did it and no one would bat an eye.  But I am open minded and I will listen to all of them.  However Files's story doesn't seem to line up with some eye witness testimony.  For example, Files claims he was the only person back there behind the picket fence.  No one else was there.  He was alone.  However Lee Bowers said he saw several men back there and at the time of the shooting he saw ""commotion"" behind the fence.  Files took his shot and left.  No commotion in that.  I recall the deaf mute's (Ed Hoffman) eye witness account as well.  He said he saw two men working together behind the picket fence.  One guy did the shooting, tossed the gun to another guy who took the gun apart, placed it in a tool box and walked away.  Files doesn't say anything like that in his story.

During the shooting, many people described  a shot, then two shots in close succession, then another shot.  However Files claims he only took one shot, the fatal head shot at the end.  He seems to suggest only one other man was shooting besides him.  That does line up with the shots heard by many people in close succession.  To me that would suggest at least two other shooters besides Files.  Who else was shooting and from where?

Like I said, Files's story is interesting, but I'm not sure I believe it.  This DVD  is definitely worth the watch though.",1370563200,44,1551,4.290657439446367

I was afraid that he would be unintelligible, but nothing could be further from the truth.  He has excellent communication skills and a very good memory.

Even if you don't believe his story, any student of the JFK assassination would probably find this to be a worthwhile film.",1369180800,3,459,4.7

He gets on to his role in the shooting of JFK and my toes curled at lack of concern he shows for the felling of a great President. This is a tour de force by Dankbaar,how on earth did he get Files to talk about it with the film rolling!

5451132,5,B00AMHFQXM,"This is what my friend retired FBI agent Zack Shelton said about our investigation.

Let me first comment on the 1 star review from Sunnyreader. First of all it is incorrect that Files is not in any files. Just google for ""Evidence for James Files continues to grow"".

Secondly, Sunnyreader refers to Robert Groden as an authority on the JFK assassination. Robert Groden is a firm supporter of the confession of James Files. To see Robert's comments on Files search Youtube for: robert groden james files

Thirdly, Sunnyreader rates the new books by Richard Belzer, Dead Wrong and Hitlist, with 5 stars:

""Fantastic book!, Run, do not walk, to get this book! I loved their last book ""Dead Wrong""- this one is even better. Highly recommended.""

Richard Belzer is also a firm believer of James Files. In fact a large part of the JFK chapter in Dead Wrong is devoted to James Files. I quote from the book:

""Former FBI Special Agent Zack Shelton, whose excellent investigative summary, The Shelton Report, appears exclusively in our JFK chapter, summed up our work ethic best: ""I don't have any theories. All I have are the facts.""

No offense meant, Sunnyreader, but a little bit more study before writing a review, is to be recommended.

Isn't it weird that the vast majority of Americans does not believe the Warren Report anymore, yet it remains the official government story on the JFK assassination? Does that rhyme with the principle of democracy where the people control their government? If you think about it, it is nothing less than contempt for the intellect of the American people. Richard Belzer, the actor of ""Law and Order"", who just released a great book called ""Dead Wrong"", summarized it quite accurately: ""90% of the American people believe that JFK was murdered in a conspiracy. The other 10% work for the government or the media"".

The fact of the matter is that JFK was removed in a coup d' etat, carried out a little more sophisticated than in the average banana republic. I always say that on november 22, 1963 the potential Kennedy dynasty, with Bobby and Ted waiting in the wings, was replaced by the Bush dynasty. This may sound odd, but few people know that the Bush family had tremendous  influence over American politics even before the Kennedy presidency. Senator Prescott Bush for example, father of George Herbert Walker Bush, had made his fortune as a banker with Brown Brothers, Harriman, some of it by financing the war effort of Adolf Hitler. This is now all well documented. He was instrumental in convincing his golf mate Eisenhower to run for President and installing his minion ""Tricky Dick"" Nixon  under him as Vice President. So Ike could stay playing golf, give a great speech when necessary, while the actual administration was run by Nixon under direction of the Bushes and friends, among them CIA director Allen Dulles and later president Gerald Ford, both Warren Commission members to ""investigate"" JFK's murder. This was much like the Reagan/Bush administration, of Iran Contra fame, was run two decades later. Had the Bushes had their way, Nixon would have succeeded Eisenhower. Were it not that Kennedy won that election. Quite surprisingly and with the narrowest margin in history. As the story goes because Kennedy had made a deal with Chicago crime boss Sam Giancana to get some votes his way in return for the broken promise to lay low on Organized Crime. In short, there is a lot more than meets the eye.

Hence I was hardly surprised when in the year 2000, I discovered on the Internet the very detailed confession of James Files, a mafia prisoner in Illinois, claiming that he fired the fatal headshot into JFK's temple from the infamous grassy knoll. I mean, I was hardly surprised that I had never heard of James Files, despite my then 12 year long study of the case. However, that long study had armed me with the ability to discern between real evidence and disinformation, with no shortage of the latter. That fact that I had never heard of James Files did actually enhance his credibility right away, maybe even before I started reading. After all, even if someone who confesses to have participated in the JFK assassination, is a kook telling a story for 15 minutes of fame, you would expect at least some publicity on the clown telling the story. Meanwhile I had of course learned that the truth is not publicized. If it is, it is usually to discredit the information. Which is exactly the case with James Files. In the little publicity there is, the authorities, including the FBI, have declared James Files ""non credible"", basically because it conflicts with the conclusions of the holy Warren Report. Meanwhile the evidence for his truthfulness continues to grow. Just last year the notorious CIA asset Luis Posada Carriles confirmed in a filmed interview that he worked with James Files on several covert CIA operations. He also admitted that he and his partner Orlando Bosch were in Dealey Plaza when Kennedy was killed. Exactly as Files and Chauncey Holt said. Actually the testimonies of Holt and Files reinforce  each other in more than one way. Files for example tells he was acting on orders of his boss and mafia enforcer Charles Nicoletti, while Holt relates how he drove with Nicoletti to Dallas. The Posada interview can be found by googling for ""Evidence for James Files continues to grow (2)"".

My discovery of James Files eventually led me to visit him in 2003 in Joliet Correctional Center, together with a cameraman and author Jim Marrs, to record a second interview. Something  he had vowed never to do again, but we could ultimately persuade him due to circumstances which are too elaborate to explain here. It's all documented in my book and DVD  ""Files on JFK"". Both of these are not bestsellers due to the total blackout in sponsoring publicity. Not because the content is not appreciated by the readers that manage to find it. In fact it is the best rated JFK assassination book on Amazon.com with a maximum 5 stars. Some of those readers ask me why they have not heard of the book before. I believe I have answered part of that question now. The naysayers are usually the more ignorant among us, not wanting to absorb the evidence, rather believing the media and authorities, like I did myself in a distant past. Some of these people argue that if the JFK assassination was such a huge conspiracy, lots of people would have talked and the conspiracy would have been exposed. Well, that is in fact exactly what happened. We are just not being told about it. Lee Harvey Oswald exclaimed at once he was ""just a patsy"". Numerous other witnesses and participants spilled the beans on the conspiracy, some  of them paying with an untimely death. The list is endless but includes Jack Ruby, Rose Cheramie, David Morales, David Atlee Phillips, Charles Nicoletti, Sam Giancana, Charles Harrelson, Johnny Roselli, Carlos Marcello, Tosh Plumlee, E. Howard Hunt, Santos Trafficante, Luis Posada Carriles, David Ferrie, Dorothy Kilgallen, Lyndon Johnson to his mistress Madeleine Brown, Oswald's girl friend Judyth Vary Baker, and on and on. Last but not least, the grassy knoll gunman himself talked.

Others say that the JFK assassination happened too long ago to be of interest today. I disagree wholeheartedly and blame it on ignorance. I maintain that that the political landscape of today is a direct result of the assassination. A sitting, elected President was removed through a secret, illegal coup d'etat and the ones who committed the crime, seized power. At least 4 succeeding Presidents were in some capacity involved in the planning and/or cover-up of the murder.  Lyndon Baines Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George Herbert Walker Bush. It is therefore safe to say that George W. Bush, the most recent ex-President, also knows that JFK's death was a coup d'etat, a crime against the American system and thus its people.. The assassination may be some time ago, but the power structure built on it, is still at the helm today. Not so long ago at all.  Besides, game changing events are never too long ago. As the late comedian Bill Hicks said: ""If the Kennedy assassination is too long ago, then quit talking to me about Jesus.""",1366934400,129,8228,4.851033499643621
5451133,5,B00AMHFQXM,"In this DVD, James Files, confessed assassin of JFK, is interviewed By Jim Marrs, author of Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy. In this interview made in 2003, James Files takes the viewer on a journey, explaining why he did it, how he did it, why he is alive, and why he will never be charged with the murder of John F. Kennedy. This is culmination of an investigation which SHOULD have taken place in December of 1963. Instead, we got a bogus investigation, no trial and no actual conviction of Lee Harvey Oswald, since well he was conveniently killed on live television, with the entire country watching.

If Lee Harvey Oswald DID NOT shoot JFK. Then did this man do it?

Have you ever asked yourself if you really believe what your told in school about American history or world history in general? Most of what we are taught in elementary school about American History is wrong, when I look at our history now with a different set of eye glasses on. I cannot believe how much they don't tell you in school about JFK, MLK and RFK and how their assassinations really changed the fabric of how Americans now view their government.

Today trust in government is at an all time low, with no signs of ever coming back. And according to Dante's Inferno, the betrayal of trust is the gravest sin of all. And when it comes to the JFK Assassination, belief and trust can't be used in the same sentence thanks to government obfuscating the truth through fiction, tv docu-dramas and things like the Warren Commission, The House Select Committee on Assassinations and the Assassinations record review board. There has NEVER yet been an HONEST investigation by the United States Government into the Kennedy Assassination. Furthermore certain JFK documents are not scheduled for release until 2017 or even 2039.

So much for we the people.

If your a researcher, and your willing to set aside your bias, and just listen to what James Files has to say and if you even care enough about the future of America or even its past, than you owe it to yourself and Millions of people around the world who were affected by the events of November 22nd 1963, If President Kennedy had lived, there would've been no Vietnam, No Watergate, No Nixon, No LBJ, No schism between the generations, and no broken country that we now live in.

It maybe too late for justice in the JFK Case, but it is never too late for the truth. And anyone who thinks the American People are too immature for the truth, are too immature to write our history books. All of us are mortal, all of us will die.

Perhaps if you listen to James Files confession, perhaps the truth will finally come to light, and perhaps we should offer him amnesty before the truth perishes with the last remaining players.

May all the Truth Be Known.

There are just too many things that don't add up, there are too many missing facts, and there are too many factors that the official story never even addresses. I don't know if Lee Harvey Oswald was innocent or not, but even if he did shoot at Kennedy, I do know he couldn't have been the only shooter. As I learned when I visited the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, even Congress said that there had to be at least two gunmen involved.

I SHOT JFK is a low budget documentary that presents one possible scenario about the Kennedy assassination. The movie is mostly a presentation of the confession of James Files (aka James Sutton). Files, a man who was involved with the mafia in his life, claims to have been the shooter who delivered the killing shot. The movie briefly examines Files claims and illustrates the possibility of the truth in his claim.

I found the scenario presented in I SHOT JFK to be an interesting one. It is possible that Files could have been the mysterious shooter on the grassy knoll. With that said, I was a little disappointed that the film didn't present more detailed evidence into some of the veracity of Files claims; it pretty much takes his account as truth and then just uses evidence to show why his story is probably true, but pretty much ignoring any evidence that contradicts his story. With that said, I still enjoyed the movie and it does a good job of at least presenting a scenario that illustrates the flaws in the one-shooter theory.",1435881600,,1575,4.601423487544484

5451171,1,B00AMHFQXM,"FBI agents interviewed James Files aka James Sutton, which is his real name, at the Joliet prison on August 9, 1993, and Files stated he would answer questions only if he were given immunity from prosecution.  He has already ""confessed"" to killing JFK and If he were to be taken seriously, these videos would be enough to convict him.  The agents asked him to take a polygraph examination which he refused.  This is enough in my mind that he is lying.  He is in prison for the attempted murders of two Illinois police officers.  I believe his motive is to get out of prison by convincing some U.S. Attorney to get him a pardon by presenting his story against now-deceased persons.  If he ever comes up for parole, this story of his should be presented before the parole board to keep him in prison for his 51-year sentence.

The evidence is that Oswald was the killer of JFK and Officer Tippet and also attempted to kill General Walker earlier and then Officer McDonald at the Texas theater.  Had he not been apprehended, Oswald would have killed more people.",1417392000,6,1059,4.595744680851064

5451177,3,B00AMHFQXM,"Well there have been hundreds, perhaps thousands of theories about the JFK Assassination, most of them are probably the most outrageous ever heard but somewhere hidden in all of these conspiracies, the truth lies somewhere.
That being said, we have James Sutton, who is now known as James Files, who is in prison serving time for another crime, who got hooked up with an investigator with the FBI, who was trying to shed some light on the assassination and eventually got Files to open up and talk.
Unfortunately, with the information Files gave to him at the time, this investigator was about to go to a judge and get an exhumation order for JFK's body for a second autopsy, which would conclusively prove that Files was involved, the investigator died suddenly.
But Files was still willing to talk and talk he did, close to three hours about his life as a runner with the Mob and then he describes that fateful day: November 22, 1963.
He sounds so convincing, it's hard not to believe him but he maintains the only way he'll testify is with immunity, he also claims to have bitten on the empty shell casing and left it on the stockade fence on the knoll. Investigators who found this casing in this condition later say the only way a person could know about this particular casing in this condition is if they put it there.
At the end of the day, it's left up to the viewer whether you believe him or not. If you examine the Mary Moorman phot closely, just to the left of the tree behind the fence, there is someone there, if you zoom it as much as you can without distortion, you can see someone looking through the scope of a gun.
I'm giving this review a three Star because it's impossible to know whether this is on the level or not but its worth it's weight in the conspiracy ring. He named names who were in the plaza that day and his narrative of the shot sequence of the assassination is chilling.
Another brilliant DVD is ""Confessions from the Grassy Knoll"", it delves deep into the JFK Assassination from retired FBI agents, who give information even I didn't know, and also shows a short blurb of James Files as well, I own this DVD also, as I am a big JFK assassination nut.",1412294400,14,2188,4.458852867830424

The long overlooked secret is that the Minutemen out of Missouri with the John Birch Society were the real actors in this execution of a 'proven' traitor in our White House.  The Type 99 Japanese machine gun was modified in CA to fire the Italian Tierney cartridge because the ammo was cheap and these old reactivated dewar machine guns are a hoot to shoot...Clinton Wheat set up a meeting for the purpose of acquiring weaponry for Oswald and Hemming/Henning but was only able to provide them with the one 'antique' because none would deal with them.  When Oswald returned from Russia he joined the first 'patriotic' organization that he found; ""The Minutemen.""  Ass the so called fair play for Cuba and 'left' wing stuff was just typical training activities that ""The Minutemen"" were known for; join the enemy and disrupt from within...I know, I was there!",1393027200,4,1242,4.631818181818182

The specials that I have seen over the years, haven't convinced me that he could get those shots off in the time that was given. If some of the best trained couldn't do it in the amount of time, then how do they expect us to believe that Oswald did it. I found this movie answered some of the questions that I've had for a long time. If you have any questions about what really happened in Dallas then you should also get this movie & watch it with an open mind.  I was only 3 years old when President Kennedy was killed, but this has been one thing in history that has always peeked my interest. My heart has always gone out to the family through the years.

5451190,4,B00AMHFQXM,"Joe West, a private investigator, started an investigation to find the true assassins of President John F. Kennedy in 1989, Houston, Texas.

James Files' true name was James Sutton, born in Alabama 1942, January 24, but according to his birth certificate he was deceased at birth. He states that when it comes to the government getting things done the Mafia are kindergarten.

Joe West was fighting to get President Kennedy's body exhumed because there would still be traces of mercury left in the body. The court accepted the order but West go ill and died so the case died also.

Files is in prison for attempting to kill an Illinois policeman after an attempt on his life, so spends his life in prison as he is a marked man if he steps foot outside. Tough, why should the taxpayer pay to keep him because of his life of crime. He admits he has killed three people before he was recuited for this job.

I was inclined to believe his interview, but my intuition told me that something is not right, so I started thinking. He has had a lot of time to get his story straight, could get information from cell mates and connections. There are a few mistakes in his interview which made me recheck with the dvd ""Confessions from the Grassy Knoll"". There was a witness in the tower behind the grassy knoll, but Files does not say anything about this fact in the interview.

On the dvd cover it states that Joe West established a relationship with Files slowly and meticulously, but in the interview Files states that after the first meeting with West he liked the man, so he started talking about President Kennedy the next day. This is a contradiction.

He also says he was kidnapped and tortured to reveal the whereabouts of a ledger (diary) was, that was about assassinations and such. If that was the case, and they wanted it so badly, I am 100% sure he would have told them or he would have been killed. They would not leave him for dead with his hands and feet strapped up and naked.

Files also states that the route of the motorcade was known five days before the event, but also says that the route was made public months ahead, but there was one change made at the last minute. How could changes be made at the last minute when all the people were lined up in the streets?

Nicoletti wanted Files to be the backup shooter as Roselli knew the C.I.A. had called off the assassination and did not want to go against orders. Files asked Nicoletti if he wanted it to go ahead. He told Files, ""F*** them. It's going ahead anyway.""

He also says that he saw Jack Ruby was in the crowd at the grassy knoll, but I do not remember this ever being stated anywhere before.

Lee Harvey Oswald was given a parafin test later by the Dallas Police department, and a document states that they only found residue on his hand, from which he got when he collected Files' spent cartridges as he calibrated his scope. I have always believed that Oswald was innocent and Files interview seems to uphold my belief.

I may be wrong but the interview seems to be too fullproof, too scripted, a playwright, a story to keep himself in prison. I don't think any one could be so correct, so consistent and remember 99.9% of everything that happened after so many years.

I would suggest you take the interview at face value, with an open mind, and seek out your own conclusion. My conclusion is: It would not be hard for a man of his calibre to find out information, and would not be the first person to do something to stay in prison (safely, maybe not), but it would be easier than outside. It would mean a lot to him in prison as the man who killed the President of the United States of America, as he would get fame, special rights from his cell mates, and even some of the guards would treat him differently. Some of the evidence can not be checked as the people are long gone to hell.

To anyone who has not seen his confession in full, I would recommend this dvd so that they could make a judgement of their own, and I give it four stars as I was a bit disappointed by the whole interview.",1381968000,8,4071,4.397606382978723
5451191,5,B00AMHFQXM,"The assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was, is and will always be a matter of controversy and conspiracy theories, to such an extent that, when the real truth comes out, nobody will believe it. Hell, the same would happen if the real Jesus Christ suddenly shows up. But every now and then a new explanation for the murder is unearthed and we have to listen to it and make our own conclusions. ""I Shot JFK: The Shocking Truth"" gives us another twist, and a very detailed and eye-opening account of what might had happened that Friday on November 22, 1963.

Directed by Robert Kiviat, the documentary entirely focuses on James Sutton, aka James Files, who at the time when the interviews were conducted, was serving time in a prison (Stateville Correctional Center, Crest Hill, Illinois) for attempted murder of a cop - he explains this in detail during the film. He mentions that he was born in Alabama, and that his birth certificate indicates that he was ""deceased at birth."" He goes on to explain in the detail his involvement in JFK's assassination. He says that the original plot was supposed to take place in Chicago, but was changed, and that he arrived to Dallas, Texas, a week before, to study the area and landscape. He also discusses the involvement of a series of individuals in planning the murder, particularly elements from the Italian mob, including Johnny Roselli, Charles Nicoletti, and Sam Giancana, all of them assassinated later. Sutton also claims that David Atlee Phillip, former CIA chief of Latin American operations, was also an important part of the plan. He also talks about Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald, and that he actually spent a considerable amount of time with Oswald, who he maintains did not shoot JFK, as it was proven by the so-called paraffin test. He also explains, step by step, how he shot the last bullet (only one), which is the one that made JFK move backwards, as he was standing behind a fence at Dealey Plaza, and that he used a Remington Fireball XP-100, at the time the ""most accurate weapon in the world."" Of course, he is also asked about the reasons to participate in the murder.

I have to confess that I was really impressed by Sutton's arguments. Good research is necessary to prove his claims. In fact, he indicated that Joe West, a Houston private investigator, requested the exhumation of JFK's body, because he wanted to provide evidence that JFK was killed with a mercury round, special load, because Mercury tends to stay in the body. A file says that the court accepted the request, but West died before it could be done. You be the judge. In addition to ""I Shot JFK: The Shocking Truth,"" MVD Visual also released the equally engaging ""Confessions form the Grassy Knoll"" and ""Spooks, Hoods & JFK,"" which contain more interesting information about the assassination of our 35th president.

Connally, using a rifle he ordered by mail (under an alias).  He ran from the scene after tossing his rifle in a corner near his sniper nest, then shot a cop while walking from his flop-house on Beckley Ave., almost shot a few more before getting the snot beat out of him at the Texas Theater in Oak Cliff (this is old skool DPD, BTW).
