2761638,4,B000NA1WE0,"Sandra Bullock's Grace Hart is one of the best character's she ever created. This semi tough FBI agent with a heart of gold is very well expressed in these both Miss Congeniality films.

William Shatner is rediscovered and restarted in these films as the had been (Bert  Parks like) MC . He acts the straight man for the humor around him and it works.

In the first film, Hart is sent in to the Miss USA beauty contest to protect the other gitl's and save the day. Benjamin Bratt plays her FBI partner. Micheal Caine is the groomer who makes her from FBI agent to Beauty Queen> Candice Bergan is the show organizer. (Boston Legal fans note, this film was FIRST!)

The second film, Grace who has become an FBI press darling, because everyone knows her from the USA contest and she can not go undercover. She has written a book and goes on press tours showcasing the NEW FBI. She is saddled with a partner who does not like her and comedy tensions ensue. Miss USA and the show's MC is kidnapped and Grace is on the case

Dont expect these films to be like the POLICE  ACADEMY films, but don't expect to be great Oscar film making either...its good set of films to enjoy for just the laughes

2761639,4,B000NA1WE0,"MISS CONGENIALITY  ***

This is a moderately entertaining, if forgettable, comedy. It showcases Ms. Bullock's comedic talents, if nothing else. The premise of the film revolves around the need for an FBI agent to go undercover as a contestant during a beauty pageant, due to intelligence reports that indicate that the pageant may be subject to a terrorist attack. Before she knows it, FBI agent Gracie Hart, a tomboyish, klutzy, and nerdy female, who snorts when she laughs, is assigned to the job. A beauty pageant coach, deliciously played by Michael Caine, is assigned to turn our erstwhile beast into a beauty. He succeeds admirably, as he has a lot with which to work.

Ms. Bullock plays her role with somewhat ham handed determination. Still, she manages to charm. Her supporting cast, which includes Benjamin Bratt, as her fellow agent and potential love interest, and Candace Bergen and William Shatner, as the pageant hosts, act as comedic foils. The pageant contestants also provide a number of light hearted screen moments. This is a comedy that is easy enough to enjoy, though predictable, as long as one's expectations are not inordinately high.

MISS CONGENIALITY 2  ****

As a sequel, this film surprisingly succeeds. Sandra Bullock, with her coltish good looks and her spot on comedic timing, successfully reprises the role of Gracie Hart, FBI agent. In fact, I enjoyed this film even more than I did the prequel, where Gracie Hart infiltrated a national beauty pageant as a contestant, her affableness winning her the award for Miss Congeniality.

It now appears, however, that Agent Hart's ability to work effectively as an agent has been compromised by the publicity that she received from her entry into that national beauty pageant. Gracie Hart is now instantly recognizable, whenever she hits the streets, by an adoring public who has taken to her as a duck takes to water.

This being the case, the powers that be at the FBI decide to make Agent Hart into a poster girl for the FBI, and she is given a mini entourage to polish their diamond in the rough. By the time they get through with her, Agent Hart is as slick and as polished as a cover girl, temporarily losing sight of why she joined the FBI in the first place.

Agent Hart is assigned a bodyguard, problem child agent, Sam Fuller (Regina King), who has some serious anger management issues. They get initially get along together like oil and water, with some funny comedic moments between the two. Ultimately, at the eleventh hour, their relationship evolves into one of mutual respect.

When Agent Hart's best friend, Miss United States (Heather Burns), is kidnapped in Las Vegas, along with pageant official Stan Fields (William Shatner), Agent Hart remembers why it was that she joined the FBI in the first place. Although she is brought into the case strictly as a media liaison, she desperately wants to be taken seriously as an agent on the case, Unfortunately, her investigative efforts are stymied by the local FBI chief, Agent Collins (Treat Williams), who views her as expendable fluff.

While the storyline may be thin, at times, there are enough memorable moments to sustain the film, not least being the excellent comedic performances given by Sandra Bullock and Regina King. It is a professionally successful pairing of two talented actresses with a flair for the comedic. Sandra Bullock proves, once again, that one can be gorgeous and funny. For Regina King, the role of Sam Fuller is a breakout comedic role for her.

Moreover, the supporting cast is likewise funny. William Shatner, who of late has proven himself to have a deft comedic touch, provides some wacky moments. It was also great to see Treat Williams, who is as attractive as ever, playing the role of Agent Collins, the tightly controlled, ego driven, local FBI chief who seeks to wrap up the case successfully for his own personal aggrandizement. Elizabeth Rohm, of Law and Order fame, is a pleasant surprise in the small role of Carol Fields, the FBI agent who is two timing her fellow agent boyfriend with their mutual boss.

Although the film has some plot holes and may be implausible, at times, it still provides some enjoyable comedic moments. There are also cameo appearances by Regis Philbin and his wife, Joy. While this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, fans of Ms. Bullock will surely enjoy seeing her in this one. This funny, silly movie is definitely worth a rental.",1164844800,5,4450,4.878145695364238

2761678,4,B000NA1WE0,"Despite being a silly little romp, Miss Congeniality has become a bit of a classic in its own way and, since a visiting friend had never seen it, we had a quick look on Amazon and found it bundled with the sequel, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.  Two days later we were sitting down to watch it again in DVD splendour (and also about to find out what the sequel was like).

Miss Congeniality
The storyline is well known and basically a combination of many classic themes: Cinderella, the Ugly Duckling, role reversal, the tough cop with the heart of gold, a small woman proving herself in a male-dominated milieu, a sceptic reassessing her preconceptions.  A cacophony of clich&eacute;s, but as everyone knows, clich&eacute;s work because they are true to life.  The attempt to make beauty contests seem less shallow and sexist than they really are is half-hearted and it only pays lip service to the cause, which is just as well because anything heavier would get in the way of the humour.

Sandra Bullock is one of my favourite contemporary actresses and in this she establishes her full acting range:  she is funny, screwed up, self-mocking, committed, moving, and physically impressive in her athletic scope (I know she had a stunt double, but in many scenes she does the punching and kicking herself).  The other pageant contestants, unfortunately, are mediocre  at best in both acting ability and looks (that part, at least, is true to life).

Michael Caine waltzes through a typically brilliant performance and Candice Bergen is convincing in her role.  The real surprise for me was William Shatner, who provided some of the funniest moments just by cringing or delivering a killer line with perfect timing.  I didn't know he had it in him.

Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous
Sequels seldom live up to the originals that spawned them, but I thought this one was different enough that it actually had its own particular appeal.  Sandra Bullock is undoubtedly a smart woman, and she displayed her acumen in the structure of Miss Congeniality 2 by retaining the key characters and bringing in a couple of new counter-heros strong enough to carry my interest to the end.  The story is obviously fluff, but there are many funny moments.

Gracie Hart, the unlikely Miss America runner-up, has tried her best to go back to her day job as a field agent, but her notoriety and public appeal have become huge handicaps and actually threaten the safety of anyone working with her.  Since Gracie is now a lemon, her boss sees a way to make lemonade by turning her into the glamorous face of the FBI.  The plot follows her hugely successful mission until her one and only friend, the reigning Miss America, is in mortal danger and Gracie has to return to active duty, saddled with a surly bodyguard who despises her and a style expert who won't allow a single one of her hairs to be out of place.

Regina King is terrific as the partner/antagonist and Diedrich Bader hams it up convincingly as an over-the-top style guru (the successor to the character played brilliantly by Michael Caine in the first movie).  Also Heather Burns has a lot more screen presence in this.  But, surprisingly again, many of the truly hilarious moments are down to William Shatner, who apparently excels at tragicomedy, although my favourite scene is the one featuring Ida: Sandra Bullock at her most daring comedic genius.  Oh, and the high-heel chase after fake Dolly, priceless!

Quite a few special features, enjoyable if you like some background info, but the quiz was too long and boring and, ultimately, a bit pointless.

My idea of entertainment is light-hearted comedy with a feel-good factor.  I'm glad we bought this DVD set because, although a bit old, it's still worth watching in preference to some of the depressing dross that passes for movies at the moment.",1459036800,,3862,4.825493171471927

The first film, Miss Congeniality, stars both Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt and is strengthened by their chemistry and comedic timing. We all loved the first film. The sequel, Armed and Fabulous, is missing Bratt altogether but tries to pick up its story three weeks after the setting of the original film and takes place over a few months afterward. Bullock's character has changed and for the worse! The main problem is bad writing and the lack of chemistry between Bullock and her new female sidekick.

These were two hit movies from the last decade and Sandra bulloch is excellent as the undercover cop who wants none the pageant scene at all. William Shatner is excellent as her gay tutor in the art of pageantry too. The blu rays look great and that's because they are newer movies. Some of these double movies have some not so great prints on them. ""kellys heroes? where eagles dare"" needed restoration work before being put on blu ray and that didn't happen. These didn't need the work thankfully, Seriously , this is a good deal, and it's upsetting that more blu rays aren't doubles like this. You can find another flick to thrown on most blu rays. You have the space for more and this will ensure more movies will get out on blu rays. These comedies were well done too.

What I am concerned with here is the fact that the description says that there are two disks, but actually there is only one double-sided disk.  I find that very disappointing because I have had trouble with that type before.  In addition to their being more susceptible to scratches, one of the difficulties is the tiny description on the rim of the disk.  I am probably not the only person who has trouble reading that.

That is the reason I am giving the movies only 3 stars.",1315785600,6,624,4.245762711864407

I had seen it on TV a number of times and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to own it. Anyway, when I saw this double DVD I was thrilled; just think, Ms. Bullock reprising her character. So, I ordered it. Well, the original was great, typical Bullock, fun plot, and I enjoy it very much. However, #2 was not so great. The plot was predictable, slow-going and, in general, boring. Ms. Bullock, however, did the best she could with what she was given. I applaud her efforts. If you're a Bullock fan, she won't disappoint you so this double DVD is worth having just to confirm that Ms. Bullock's talent can rise above a lousy script.",1309737600,,732,4.389705882352941

2761820,5,B000NA1WE0,"This is a funny spoof of the pageant world, with enough honesty to admit these girls work hard for their awards, and most of them are really nice girls. Our undercover cop is a total dropout from Uncouthsville, hilarious and accident prone - but touched by the kindness of the competing girls.  Taking place in San Antonio, Texas, the pageant people barely tolerate this NYPD unladylike cop who needs a whole team working on her all night to make her look presentable.  Her extreme competitiveness is undermined by her compassion and lack of discipline on the police force. Initially unwilling to be the undercover agent, her desire to save these girls lives overcomes all hardships and her cleverness helps her crack the code to find the maniac out to kill them.  This is not a GREAT movie, but it is a lot of fun to watch and has some quotable lines:  ""You want to kiss me...""  ""World Peace""  This is a really purple Russian!""",1274572800,,928,4.628048780487805

2761822,5,B000NA1WE0,"Miss Congeniality is very very good and funny.  Miss Congeniality 2 good but not as funny.  I love Sandra Bullock no matter what movie she is acting in.  Sandra Bullock is down to earth and unpretenious.

Packing and shipping of item good.  DVD in good condition.",1272240000,,263,4.630434782608695
2761823,5,B000NA1WE0,"These movies are both very guilty pleasures of mine and always have been ever since they came out. I have to admit that I wasn't really expecting it to have the greatest picture quality, but since I got a great deal I thought I'd give it a go. I was wrong, the movie looked a lot better on blu-ray than I expected. Sure it's not the best looking one out there, but it's definitely worth getting.",1270684800,18,395,4.2105263157894735

2761826,5,B000NA1WE0,"Both Miss Congeniality 1 and 2 were both good movies.  Sandra Bullock is great in both.  In the first she is an ill mannered, unrefined women working in the FBI, who is drafted to enter a beauty contest.  Her trials and tribulations getting there is hilarious.  It's a wonderful thing when she finds her inner woman.

In the second movie she is back to being that agent but now she is a Las Vegas showgirl.

These movies are entertaining and are something my daughter and I can enjoy together.",1264550400,,493,4.48314606741573
2761827,4,B000NA1WE0,"A terrorist attack on Miss America. What a hilarious concept! Miss Congeniality takes the idea and runs with it. Sandra Bullock is at her best in this movie, providing the anti-Miss America - smart, tough, and graceless. Her acting makes her character seem really genuine, flaws and all. I will never forget the absurdity of her ""Swiss fruitcake"" dress. The rest of the cast provides great support, from Michael Caine to William Shatner as pageant officials. Overall, this is a classic comedy that will probably last a long time.",1262476800,,529,4.955056179775281
