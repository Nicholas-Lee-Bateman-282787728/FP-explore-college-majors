191916,5,1573309982,"If you only buy one fitness tape, this has to be it. At first when I started I thought ""how much of a workout can I get out of 6 two minute intervals"". Boy was I mistaking. Those intervals work you hard, but  the best part are the cool down periods in between each interval. Within  one week I noticed my thighs becoming fimer. I also lost 5 pounds in one  week (also in part of a strict diet). I feel energetic and alive. I  recommend this tape to beginers who want to shed pounds and to the advanced  folks who want to stay in shape. Oh and another thing the tape just flies  by. That is what gets me coming back.",930700800,3,615,4.0
191917,5,1573309982,"I love Kathy Smith, and this is my favorite video so far.  With the 2 minute intervals between intense workout & active recovery, it goes fast, and you can't get discouraged and quit.  In the intense interval, you  push yourself, and then you get to slow down for 2 minutes while you tone  your lower body.  The moves are fun and easy to do for beginners, and if  you're more advanced, they are easily modified (she shows you how).  If  you're also wanting to tone your upper body, a great complement to this is  the ""Secrets of a Great Body:  Upper Body Workout"" by Kathy  Smith.  It's made to do only twice a week, and can be done on the same day  as this video.  (There's also a lower body workout, but you probably won't  want to do it along with the Functionally Fit video.)",928108800,41,779,4.275862068965517
191918,4,1573309982,"Kathy Smith is the right amount of perky.  She leads her troupe of excerise groupies with authority and is fun to watch.  This is a great workout which alternates 2 minute sections of cardio/aerobic work with  lesser impact moves designed to tone the lower body.  She has done a good  job of choosing excerises which use large muscle groups, so more calories  are burned. Kathy and her crew have the required amount of enthusiasm, and  are well coordinated, but you should buy this video just to see the guy in  the back.  I know he means well but it looks like he's having some sort of  an attack.  Do not try his unique style of aerobics at home, you might hurt  yourself :)
No equipment is neccesary for this workout.  You'll burn lots  of calories but don't expect to get a very good upper body workout.",917308800,27,807,4.438356164383562

Surely it is possible to do a workout that works without having to keep switching what your suppose to be doing?

191924,5,1573309982,"Finally a real warm-up and cool-down, many instructors skip that nowadays. Also, this is a real interval workout. Basic moves so when the intensity is picked up, you can concentrate on your form and pushing yourself, not where your feet are going. The timeclock for the 2-minute intervals isn't up on the screen for the full 2 minutes, which is great because that would've been torture. I actually couldn't finish all the intervals the first time I did this...she kicked my butt. Excellent active recovery between intervals and good modifiers for low impact or beginners. Good cuing and form reminders from Kathy. One of her better workouts.",1175990400,,641,5.0
191925,5,1573309982,I used to do some exercises on my own and had joined gym for sometime. But it was boring..I could never continue for a long time. I had put on a lot of weight and my BMI had crossed the limit. Thought of trying aerobics as it's with music and I love music. I wanted something indoor as it was almost winter and I knew I'll not make it to the gym everyday. After reading the reviews of this DVD I thought of trying this one. It's fabulous!!Kathy is so good in this..she explains each and every move and if you are a beginner(me too) you can follow the beginner moves which is done by two of Kathy's associates and rest two carry on the advanced moves..It really worked for me and I lost 8 pounds..and my BMI is now within limit..If u r a beginner too go ahead and by this one now..u'll find the difference..I bet..and guess what..I just do it 3 times a week..Isn't that good?,1169596800,2,874,4.177514792899408
191926,5,1573309982,"I've been using this DVD for 3 months now.  I had initially been disappointed because it was so easy. I thought it was not strenous enough.  I now see this as a positive thing since I use it every day (I'm 55 years old and have no trouble with the exercises), and sometimes I double the length of the cardio part just for kicks.  I would hesitate to use it often if it were hard.  Excuses are too easy to find.  I can do this DVD on my most comatose days.  I still do the cardio parts with high impact on any day: that is, I DON'T follow the cardio parts at all, even with jumping jacks I jump faster and use my arms more.  I also like the DVD because it is structured.  Kathy Smith has a very pleasing voice and is not irritating.",1151366400,5,731,3.9931034482758623
191927,5,1573309982,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this DVD has simple moves that are easy to follow, but the cardiac bursts really get you pumping. I love this because I can take it on the road with my laptop and have a great cardio workout in a hotel, visiting relatives, wherever, without much space required and in any weather. Kathy's videos are all good but this is my favorite.",1145923200,11,370,4.455882352941177

191929,5,1573309982,"I really enjoy this workout, with the DVD I can do over the workout phase without having to rewind like with the VHS.

I originally wore out about 3 of her VHS workouts from rewinding and using again.  That makes it twice as much as you would just rewinding them once.",1142640000,2,268,4.235294117647059
191930,5,1573309982,"I love this workout tape.  I have virtually all Kathy's tapes and this one, along with Fat Burning Breakthrough and Kickboxing, is my favorite.  The workout is about 35 minutes total with a little bit of stretching afterwords.  The first couple of times you will do this will be hard on your body if you really work it during the intervals, but after you are more acclimated to it the time just flies by.  The squats that you do in between intervals are an absolute must for getting rid of those big hips and thighs.  There are no weights with this tape so I recommend using one of her exclusive weight workout tapes when you are done.",1141171200,4,635,4.3931623931623935
191931,5,1573309982,"I love this video. I'm a pretty heavy exerciser and this video is an excellent workout. Kathy breaksdown the intervals in a way that is very easy to understand and explains how you should be feeling throughout the video. I especially like that the video has a timer on the bottom of the screen to let you know how much longer you have left of the routine. It's a great way to stay motivated when you know that you only have 28 seconds left. She's adorable (not at all annoying like some other video instructors) and really pushes you. I was always a huge Aerobic video skeptic but this is a great one. I've already noticed a change in my body just from her toning exercises and the stretches at the end keep you from being stiff the next day. I definitely recommend this video for people who want to look sleek and fit (don't worry about gaining unwanted ""bulk"" or mass with this video, it's a slimmer)!",1140048000,,903,4.380952380952381
191932,4,1573309982,"This workout WORKS. It raises your heart rate, gets you moving, gets you breathless and is short enough to fit into ""shorter"" workout days - at 40 minutes including stretches. A perfect way to get your minimum 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a day!

Kathy Smith is a great workout instructor, and we have at least a dozen of her videos at home. She's AWESOME about teaching moderating moves, and those moderate moves will still help you lose weight! Once you learn how to modify your workout to your own pace, you can apply these moves to nearly every other workout you do, if you can't do high-intensity for any reason, or if you're new to working out.

She also lets you ""preview"" the move before ratcheting up the pace. Her instruction at how NOT to do the move is critical - listen to her and watch her in order to get the best technique.

The intervals are really short - just enough time to get the move down and get breathless, then recover ""actively"" in her toning intervals. This formula is great because it prevents boredom!

I'd skip the stretch in the warm-up by fast forwarding, or marching out or jogging. While it's a short stretch, it's still in that early 90's trend of stretching before working out, which can actually lead to injury if you're TOO limber. Then you might pull something. Better to stretch longer AFTER the workout, since you're doing all those lower body toning moves.

As always, Kathy Smith is better aimed at women than men, even though she has guys in her videos.

Downers: The music volume is much TOO low. I like being able to hear the music when I workout, it helps me get into things. But the music is barely audible here. Which may not be a bad thing, because what one CAN hear isn't great.

I'd pair this with only one segment of her ""Timesavers Lift Weights to Lose Weight"", if you have enough time.",1134691200,7,1843,4.483582089552239
191933,3,1573309982,"I am providing a review of the VHS tape.  Functionally Fit is a good alternative for those who feel like doing a longer ""aerobic"" workout without the entire workout at high impact level.  What Kathy Smith has done for this workout is provide a good balance of warm-up, stretch, and six two-minute ""high impact"" aerobic bursts.  In between the cardio bursts are periods of ""recovery"" when Kathy and the group bring down the heart rate with a series of lower body ""toning"" moves (squats, various balance movements, torso stretches...).  Kathy also previews each cardio segment before a ""2:00"" clock appears on the screen, which provides both anticipation and preparation of the cardio segments, and at the .30 second mark, the knowledge that relief is near!  As mentioned in other reviews, there is Kathy leading the group and keeping the workout at mid-level; behind her are two workout assistants, one working at the higher level during the cardio bursts, the other is the ""modifier,"" keeping it at a lower level of intensity.  On two podiums off to Kathy's right, again one will find another set (Bill, the apparent exercise consultant for this workout, and Nancy, who is in many of Kathy's workouts) of exercise assistants working at the high and modified levels.  What I enjoy about this workout is that one receives a solid warm-up, a good thirty minutes worth of combined aerobic bursts with in-between toning, and a good, final stretch.  If one does not feel like doing the twenty minute ""quickie"" workouts, or is not up to a long, high impact workout, this workout provides just the right combination of warm-up, cardio and toning intervals, and a final stretch.  One may choose to either work to the max during the cardio bursts, or modify, which is a great option on those days when one may not really have the energy to ""hop it up,"" so to speak.  Although Kathy does say that she will take the exerciser through ""four more intervals,"" besides the original interval, there are actually six cardio bursts, which I found a bit amusing.  Regardless, this is another good aerobic workout from Kathy Smith to add to one's exercise library.",1134000000,15,2143,4.8598901098901095
191934,5,1573309982,"Like others, I bought this DVD because of all of the positive reviews I read. I was looking for a way to make cardio bearable, but everything I tried was either not intense enough, or totally unmotivating. I found this video a perfect balance. It's the right length, requires only a small space, and brings a great sense of acheivement.

It's movements are complex enough to be interesting, but not hard to learn. The combinations are long enough that you only run through four times or so each interval, but short enough that you don't struggle to remember what comes next. Her modifiers are well placed, constantly in view.

Kathy Smith has been around since I was a kid - my mum had her tapes. She still looks great, and has just the right attitude for me. Her cueing is excellent; she is as easy to follow as she is to like!",1130284800,10,828,4.440789473684211
191935,5,1573309982,This DVD workout is challenging and fun to do.  The choreography is simple to learn but really does the job of getting your heart rate going.  I highly recommend the tape for the intermediate exerciser. This tape alternates between aerobic and tonic workouts with an emphasis on the cardio portion.,1128816000,5,298,4.94
191936,4,1573309982,"I've had this Kathy Smith title since it first came out. At the time, I was an advanced beginner at aerobics (though I'd weight-trained for many years). I found even the beginner level fairly challenging, so I wouldn't recommend this for total beginners or people in really bad shape. I found it easy over time to gradually add a more advanced move here and there as my aerobic fitness built up. I still enjoy doing Functionally Fit after all these years, and I feel great during and after I've done it. Kathy is very motivating, and the workout goes quickly. The intervals keep it interesting. I think the reviewers who said this was too easy must be extremely fit, advanced aerobic exercizers. Most mere mortals will get a great workout.

I didn't give the workout 5 stars for a number of reasons. The music IS a bit annoying, and was even back in the 90s. Minor point. More significant is the terrible form used by the advanced level male exercizer. Fortunately he's in the back and not shown that often, and there's an advanced female exercizer shown who has good form. I also don't think you can rely on this workout for your lower body toning. There's not enough of it, and it's not sufficiently intense. But as a cardio workout, this one's hard to beat.",1126569600,,1260,4.575221238938053
191937,5,1573309982,"This is a video that I bought when I felt ready to move on to intermediate from beginner.  I was immediately challenged by the two minute high intensity aerobic intervals.  The cool down portions with lower body toning were moderately challenging.  Now I do the advanced aerobic moves and work up a good sweat.  I like the interval aspect of this video, because I feel like I am getting a lot done in 40 minutes.",1118880000,2,412,4.453333333333333
191938,5,1573309982,"This was the very first fitness tape I have ever purchased .. actually, it is the first tape I've ever even SEEN.  I have had spinal cord damage since I was 13 and my legs are very weak and kinda shriveled.  My arms are very weak, and I have been almost completely immobile for 3 years. I never thought I could even TRY something like this -- but it has worked out great.  In four weeks I have lost seven pounds; 3 inches from my hips/tush, 2 inches from my waist, 1 inch off my bust, and 1.5 inches off of each thigh.  What makes this more remarkable is that I was only 15 pounds overweight to start with.  Usually the less you need to lose, the longer it takes to lose it.  I feel like I'm melting! LOL  The most important thing though is that I can actually SEE muscles all over my body.  My thighs are rocks and I've got biceps that my husband is jealous of!  I am stronger and feel healthier than I have felt since I was a teenager.

I was so excited by my progress, that I went online and bought about six more videos.  Now that I have seen all of them, I can definitely say that this video is the perfect one for either: beginners, moderately disabled individuals, people who are not in ""peak"" physical form, or ""older"" folks like me (42) LOL.

The workout is broken up as follows: warm up; workout with 12 intervals (alternating between heart rate up & heart rate down); cool down/stretch.  For those of you who are weaker due to disability or inactivity, do what I did.  The first day I only did the warm-up.  The next day I did the warm-up plus one ""set"" of the intervals.  By the third day, I made it all the way thru the video!  Just when I was about to quit, Kathy says ""the good news is that you only have one interval left!"" .. well, who could pass up that challenge!  The count-down clock makes the ""hard"" intervals easier to get thru and the way the workout is broken up into pieces makes the time go by VERY quickly.

Regardless of your ""level"", you will definitely get a good workout.  I bought a heart monitor and the intervals do exactly what they are supposed to do --- heart rate up/down as expected.

The set-up has Kathy leading the exercises with four ""helpers"" behind her -- Robin & Bill who are more advanced; Adina & Nancy  handle the easier versions.  Although their incessant ""smiling"" will bug you, Adina has become my new best friend.  I watch her instead of Kathy for almost every exercise.  There are two exercises that are difficult for me because of my back (lunges and jumping jacks), but it is easy to just make up your own modifications so you can keep moving.  With the modifications, the whole workout is pretty much NON-impact which is great for the knees, ankles and back.  No jumping, no dancing, no weights.

Naturally, if you do have medical problems, check with your doc before you take this on .. but I am thrilled with my success and it is great to have my legs ""working"" again. :)",1118880000,4,2931,4.299270072992701
191942,3,1573309982,"FOR INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED READERS 1 star:
I'm in an upper intermediate level.  I regularly do the Tae Bo Live tapes. I bought Kathy Smith's kickboxing tape, and that gives a great workout. But with this Fat Burning workout, I have heard so many great reviews of how tough this is, and it really isn't at all. Not even a drop of sweat and my heart rate got up to that of a medium pace walk. I do believe that I burned fat, but for the intermediate/advanced user this isn't worth your time. It's not even a workout to use if you're having a lazy day. This is a workout we would use if you feel you're really really sick, but want to work out. That's how easy it is even when doing the ""advanced"" modifications. So if you're inter/advanced (especially if you do step or Tae Bo, which CRUSH this workout), pass on this one and get the Kathy Smith kickboxing one instead, ESPECIALLY if you do Tae Bo, and want a change. However, if you're a martial artist, or really are into Tae Bo and have gotten used to Billy, Shelly, Jasmine, and Juliette doing the moves with serious intensity; Kathy Smith might get on your nerves with her perkiness and aerobic approach to it, just watch the real martial artist that she hired.

FOR BEGINNERS 5 stars:
This workout is EXCELLENT for beginners. I'm not just saying that. In fact, that's why I'm giving it 3 stars to meet middle of the road. If I were a beginner, I would give it 5, but its only because I have seen it listed in most places as intermediate workout, and everyone rants and raves about how advanced this workout is. So beginners, don't believe it, and don't be scared. This workout, although really easy for me was fun. I couldn't believe that the 40 min were up already. I have done easy tapes that seem to drag on and on, which are boring, but I liked this video. This says a lot for me because Kathy Smith is a little annoying to me. Not as annoying as Denise Austin, but annoying enough. I do think that a lot of people would like her personality. This is just my preference not to.  I don't like workouts where EVERYONE is smiling ALL the time, looking like they are about to break into song. If you're smiling, it's not hard enough. On Tae Bo if someone screams, its cuz they are in pain and need the release. Kathy went ""Woo"", and it was as if someone held up a cue card for her to say it. It was just so fake to me. I don't think she meant it.  She has the personality of Jenny Jones. But I know that a lot of people would enjoy her personality. As I stated, she's not so perky that you want to smack her, she's very pleasant and nice. I see why a lot of people enjoy her.  Kathy has modifications so that as your fitness increases you can follow a different person on the workout, which I think is great for beginners. She also gives you a bit of a rest in between intervals. You're still moving, but you're not just walking in place.  I'm  actually considering keeping this DVD for my mother who is extremely out of shape and scared to do exercises. She actually enjoys Kathy Smith enough to do the workout again. I STRONGLY and HIGHLY RECOMMEND this workout for BEGINNERS. You all will love it, just like my mom does.",1113868800,10,3176,4.292153589315526
191943,5,1573309982,"This is the workout that I always come back to.  I have had it for years(at first in VHS format) and it is my favorite. It burns fat through aerobic intervals and strengthens the lower body through lots of squats.  It also has a few balancing moves as well. The choreography is really smooth--the exercises just flow together, which makes it easy to follow. There is a very good warm-up that gets your heart pumping; not just breathing and a few stretches, but a real warm-up.  The two minute aerobic intervals seem to make the work out go by more quickly and the strength training is very effective. The cool down really focuses on sretching out your legs which feels soooo good after all the squats.  Another plus is Kathy Smith.  Her directions are clear and she doesn't get on my nerves :) This is a great DVD that gives results fast!",1112572800,3,838,4.4868421052631575
191944,5,1573309982,"I do nearly all of my workouts at home via videotape and/or DVD, and Kathy Smith is my hands-down favorite.  And this is my hands-down favorite Kathy Smith workout.  The interval training makes the time fly by, and the ability to use high, intermediate, or low-impact moves lets you customize your workout.  I have always done the highest intensity moves, and have felt challenged, but not overwhelmed.  Also, each interval of aerobics uses only a few moves repeated for two minutes, so it's very easy to quickly learn the steps.  This allows you to concentrate on increasing the intensity, which is what I try to do.  If I'm feeling really energetic, then I really push myself.  Again, because the moves are simple, I don't have to focus that much.  I've done this workout so many times, and for so many years, that I know every word that's about to come out of Kathy's mouth and have every musical note memorized.  Because I'm so sick of listening to it, I usually mute the tv and listen to music instead.  I still have no problem following the routine.",1111795200,,1055,4.623655913978495
191945,4,1573309982,"I am a person who hates to exercise. Having said this, I really, really like this tape. I like the fact that you can use the different intensity levels. At one point, I was doing the high intensity workout, and after I had recovered from surgery, I was doing the low one, and still getting a challenging workout. I also like the fact that the steps are very easy, as I don't like dancy tapes. I just want to sweat, not try out for the Rockettes. I also like the fact that Kathy is probably as unirritating as a fitness host is ever going to be. I say this because I find most hosts on these tapes to act and chirp like lobotomized cheerleaders and Kathy does not. She's more like a normal person who's helping you along.",1111276800,,720,4.22463768115942

The intervals are challenging and make the time fly by and I really sweat with this one (although it's still do-able).  The moves are very easy to follow, too (very important for a klutz like me).  Buy it -- you won't regret it.

P.S.:  Lots and lots and lots of squats.  If they bother you, you may want to avoid this workout (or simply check your form -- stick your butt way back and don't ever allow your knees to go further forward than over your toes).  There are no weights -- it's pure cardio, but the standing, unweighted lower body exercises will help tone your tush and legs.",1108598400,5,762,4.3546099290780145

I wanted something fairly simple because I get confused/lost easily with more complicated moves and this DVD was definitely simple.  My Mom borrowed it and found it challenging (physically).

The only thing I did in addition after the 1st six weeks, was I started doing the 'abdominizer' (""rock, rock, rock your way to better abs""), following the tape that came with it as well (10 min max).

191951,5,1573309982,"I have been working out to this video 3 times a week for the past 4 weeks.  Already, I feel stronger, especially from the squats she teaches you to do correctly.  I love that the video is interval style so that you alternate between a hardcore 2 minute sweat-exploding workout and then an active recovery where you bring your heart rate down while toning.  So, not a second is wasted.  By having the active recovery, I'm also able to continue on with the sweaty parts because I would definitely be getting tired if I did 40 minutes straight of hardcore working out.

Kathy has a great personality and explains the moves very well for beginners.  Even people with two left feet will be able to do this video.  Kathy's cues are right on, so you don't get lost when switching to a new move.

Also, Kathy likes to change things up so that you don't get bored.  The moves are fun and varied.  She has a great warmup before the actual workout begins, and a great cooldown with stretches.

In the video, there are 4 other ""athletes"" doing the routine and you can focus your attention on the ones who do the advanced version, or watch the modifiers who make the moves slightly easier.  Kathy tends to do the more advanced moves.  There is something for everyone with this video.

I break a sweat every time, and I feel great afterwards.  It's a wonderful cardio/toning workout that doesn't require any props.  Also, you really don't need that much space in front of the TV to do the routine.  If you can walk two steps in every direction, you have enough floor space.  After having done this video now for 4 weeks, I am still loving it.  When will I get sick of it!????  I don't know.  Kathy Smith is just that great. =)",1100304000,3,1712,4.405750798722044

I would call myself an advanced exerciser, and this workout still challenges me.
Kathy Smith has a great personality without a lot of fake perkiness, which can be really irritating.  I rotate this DVD with her Timesaver Super Cardio workout and Step workout on my cardio days, and I couldn't be happier with the rotation.  Her workouts and a sensible diet keep me in my size 4 clothes!!  Thanks Kathy!!",1089936000,2,674,4.403225806451613
191956,5,1573309982,"Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning provides an excellent aerobic workout for advanced beginner to intermediate exercisers.  It uses an interval training strategy, which involves alternating high intensity bursts with slower recovery periods; research has suggested that this method burns calories more effeciently than steady-state forms of cardio training.
The workout begins with a warm-up lasting approximately 6 1/2 minutes.  I thought that some of the moves felt a bit awkward at first, but they were simple and easy-to-follow.  This segment also included some basic stretching moves.  The warmup flows smoothly into the interval workout, which starts with a few additional minutes of warming up.  During this time, instructor Kathy Smith previews the upcoming moves, so that by the time you pick up the pace, you know exactly what is coming next.  Each interval consists of two minutes at a higher intensity followed by two minutes of ""active"" recovery.  Because the workout also is based on the principle of functional fitness, all of the exercises are designed to replicate ""real life"" movements--eg, leg raises, knee lifts, etc.--and thus the routine is extremely easy to learn.  The recovery periods include a large number of squats, so you get in some excellent lower body toning in addition to the aerobic conditioning.  Following the 28-minute intervals segment, there is a 5-minute stretching section, and the entire workout clocks in at approximately 42 minutes.
I tend to avoid most aerobic videos because they leave me feeling overworked and exhausted, so this routine was a pleasant surprise.  Although Kathy does stress the importance of pushing yourself during the high intensity segments, repeatedly stating that you want to ""make yourself breathless,"" the fact that each segment was only two minutes long made it easy for me to stay motivated.  Furthermore, Kathy was very encouraging throughout the workout, reminding you of the time left in each segment (an on-screen clock showed the 1-minute and 30-seconds points) as well as how many intervals were left in the workout.  Kathy works with four background exercisers, two of whom show lower impact modifications and two of whom kick it up a notch for those wanting to go even more intense.
I'm excited about discovering this video and hopeful that engaging in interval training will boost my fitness progress; highly recommended to anyone looking for a new and different type of aerobic workout.",1089590400,9,2469,5.286445012787723

After the first couple times you do the video you'll memorize the moves.  By the end of the tape you'll be drenched in sweat and smiling from cheek to cheek!  The greatest part is that you can modify your workout depending on your level of fitness.  There are different people for you to follow depending on how experienced you are.  Many people have thanked me for recommending this tape, you won't be sorry if you buy it.  The only thing that could improve it, is if it was made available on DVD!!",1086134400,5,642,4.088

This workout uses interval training format, with 6 two minute intense intervals followed by a two minute active recovery in which you slow right down and do strengthening exercices. One thing I don't like is that the transition between the interval and the active recovery is too abrupt and choppy. I have another interval training video which has much smoother transitions.

This is probably a very useful video for those who are very over weight and out of cardiovascular shape. For those who are in fair to good shape and work out frequently - this tape is not for you.

I have a tendancy to overdo exercise and push too hard, so it really helps for me to follow a structured workout tape from beginning to end and then turn it off. The tape is set up so you do intense 2 minuite cardio intervals followed by a short active recovery, in which you do squats and leg lifts etc, until your heart goes down and then it repeats. Its true that vigerous exercise is necessary for weight loss, well in me it is anyway. I find that there is a lot of lateral motion, side to side steps, and some steps that feel different and cool. I skip the recovery and just do the intervals and go straight through which gives me about a 20 min workout. The tape will get easier for you as you do it, so you may have to put more intensity into the moves. My favorite part of the tape is the stretch at the end. I do cycling and pilates and I always practice the stretches I learned in this segment everytime I work my legs. I should warn you about the last segment tho, It involves a move where you twist from the toroso and punch, which is really totally unecessary and as a result I ended up hurting my lower back. my doctor told me to stop doing that part of the tape, and the pain went away.

I was attracted to the concept of a high-low workout to burn fat.

The cooldown definitely should have been longer and the stretch section should be longer as well.  But all in all, this video is more than worth the money.",979516800,3,709,4.358778625954199

I enjoy the video because it is diverse, and seems to go fast because your changing exersizes often.  By the end I am tired, but I set up a timer, so that motivates me when I get fatigued, knowing that I've only got 7 minutes left.  The cool down is a little too short for me, but on the whole I think anyone will like this video.  I sure do feel great after having done it, and Kathy recommends only 3 times a week with this workout-not too bad.  Good luck!",975888000,5,579,3.9482758620689653

192005,2,1573309982,"In as much as I enjoy exercise, I really did not find much excitement or challenge in this video. The routines were basic and the music boring.  I did not even break a sweat.  I really enjoy interval training, however Kathy Smith's intervals lacked the intensity that I am used to.  On a more positive note, I think that this video would be a great introduction to interval training for a beginner or someone who is out of shape.  I just need something a bit more rigorous than this.",974073600,2,483,4.393258426966292
192006,4,1573309982,"The exercises are easy to follow, as they are first done at low intensity. I loved that the two ""adjusters"" showed the moves at a both  higher and lower intensity, so you can choose your level. The only thing I  did not like is that the cool down periods between 2-minute intensity  intervals are rather long. Personally, I prefer ""active recovery""  to be a bit more active. Verdict: great for beginner to intermediate, but  may be not for a more advanced exerciser.",967680000,2,466,4.634146341463414

(Note to the makes of fitness tapes: a close up of  the instructor's face is not going to help me figure out what I'm supposed  to be doing with my arms and feet!)
The routine is challenging, but you  can easily take a time out by marching in place and then get right back  into it.  The two minute intervals are tough at first, especially if you're  just starting an exercise plan, but at the same time, it's only two minutes  and then you can get your breath back.
I highly recommend this if you're  just learning how to do aerobics.",965174400,,707,4.320610687022901

I have more energy and really enjoy doing it.  I also have found that the  more I workout to it, the more  I realize that it's a total body workout.  Since you keep your stomach held for everything you do during it; and you  are working your chest and arms at the same time.  I have felt more evenly  worked after this workout compared to her Kickboxing one.  But it's a nice  alternate tape.  I just wish that the Peak Fat-Burning was on DVD.  That's  the only thing ""bad"" I can say about it.  Good Luck with it, if  you decide on getting it.",964915200,3,690,4.075187969924812
192009,5,1573309982,"I've been doing this workout 4 times a week for about four weeks now, and I've found that my body really responds well to the ""cardio burst"" training.  In the past I've tried several low-impact tapes,  which never seemed to move me beyond the ""beginner"" level, though  I would work up a sweat.  In just four weeks, I've been able to work my way  up to the more intense level - and have had a noticable improvement in my  stamina, whether I'm gardening, moving furniture, holding yoga poses or  dancing. I tried one of my old low-impact tapes earlier this week, and I  didn't even break a sweat!  So it's worked for me. An added benefit are the  lower body toning exercises, some of which are designed to help strengthen  the stablizer muscles that help you balance. I'd definitely recommend to  beginners/intermediate exercisers this as good addition to a collection of  cardio tapes.",962064000,7,884,4.699346405228758
192010,5,1573309982,"This workout is great because it has at least two different levels of intensity. Beginners may find the intervals difficult, however you will master them in a matter of days.  If you are at an advanced level, you can  really push yourself and get a good workout as well.  Everyone will sweat  and tire in this video!  Beware: you mainly work the lower body, so if you  want upper body moves this isn't for you.  However, I have seen amazing  results on my lower body :)",957052800,3,469,4.372093023255814

I personally have six different Kathy Smith workouts, and she  never disapoints me.  I am a mother of two small children, and Kathy  Smith's ""Functionally Fit"" tape has been a great way for me to  not only burn calories, but to also get physically stongger. Kathy always  gives great insructions and cues in all of her videos. Yes her tapes are on  the more difficult side, but if you want to shed the extra pounds this tape  can help you do it.  I also recommend, for anyone with very little time  (like us moms), the ""Timesaver Cardio Fat Burner"". It gives an  excellent workout in just twenty minutes, and there are two different  twenty minute workouts on the tape so you won't get bored.",955497600,22,852,4.503267973856209
192012,5,1573309982,"What a fun video! I always feel invigorated after doing this video. Even out here in the desert I break a pretty decent sweat! I am a rather active person, so during hectic work weeks or extremes in weather, it takes the  place of some of my outdoor activities.
The instructions are clear, and  the cueing isn't too bad. The intervals help break up the monotony that's  encountered in so many videos, making the time pass very quickly. I also  appreciate that it is intense enough for a good workout, but I don't wake  up the next day with my knees aching.
I don't have any complaints about  this video, except for the moderator in the back -- the one guy looks as  though he might hurt himself. I would not recommend this video for  beginning exercisers. It does provide two levels of intensity for beginners  and advanced, but even the warm-up at the beginning gets your heart going.
I would definitely recommend this video to anyone looking for a quick  workout with maximum benefit.",955411200,11,986,4.582857142857143

After using that tape only 2 times, I was greatly encouraged and motivated enough to look up her other tapes.  I read the reviews here  but I was even more pleasantly surprised when I purchased the tape.  Although I have not yet worked out to the entire tape, I continue to add on  each time.  She is a great motivator and she tells you when a move will  change.  One thing I like VERY MUCH: the music is not loud enough to be  annoying.  It is there for the beat but not to drown out the instructor.  I  want to hear her and be motivated.  Enjoying the tape, the instructor, and  the choreography of the exercises is enough motivator for me! You must try  this tape!",953510400,3,754,4.211267605633803

I found  I got a great workout, even doing low impact.  I have a couple of other  Kathy Smith videos, but this one is, by far, the best!

It fits for whatever your  level of fitness. The intervals go by quickly and the recovery periods  really work on your lower body. Kathy is wonderful at explaining everything  as she goes and previewing all the moves before each interval. The warm up  is also great, and the stretch at the end is invigorating.

If  you have never tried it, interval training is a great way to enhance  endurance and speed to your regular workouts.

The hi-intensity intervals really do get your heart pumping as Kathy encourages you to get breathless.  With 2 minute intervals, you are getting as much calorie-burning power you  can out of the workout.  I think the best thing about the workout is that  the moves are very simple and easy to follow, unlike most other aerobic  workout videos I've seen. I am pretty uncoordinated, yet even on my first  try with the video I was able to keep up. Also, Kathy and her crew are not  overly perky and annoying in their enthusiasm for fitness.

I found that video is mostly for beginners and low impact (which is what I want). So, after trying this workout I was really happy. The reasons that this workout is really good is because, it's FUN! And, you do some more upbeat/energized moves, but it actually didn't feel like I was out of breath or overexerted (which by the way, I get out of breath very easy, so this was surprising). I really enjoyed the video. It wasn't as long as her other videos, but it was still a good length. It seemed to finish so fast (since I was having so much fun)!

I can do this workout and I have two knee replacements.  Even though I don't need a person to show me low impact modifiers, there is one person who does a slower, lower impact version of the cardio segments and there is one person who does a faster, higher impact version of the cardio segments.  The workout transitions smoothly from warm up, into the workout.  The cardio phases are not so you will be too out of breath to transition to the lower body exercises which are all done standing.  It is not challenging for someone looking for a longer, tougher workout, but it is great for beginners and people like me who need lower impact aerobics yet still want to raise there heart rate and break a good sweat.  Kathy does not rush the cool down or stretch.  It is thorough and long enough to cool off.  No equipment is needed other than possibly a mat for the stretching.  It can be done in a small space and for this reason would make a good traveling exercise DVD.",1340668800,,1113,4.3125
