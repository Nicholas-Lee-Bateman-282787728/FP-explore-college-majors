7879413,1,6304744633,I don't know where these other reviews came from (they are identical to the ones for drunken wu tang though).  This movie is NOT Drunken Wu Tang.  I bought it under the impression that it was.  Even IMDB says it is the same.  It isn't don't be fooled.  It doesn't even have the same actors in it!!!!!!!  The IMDB web page is wrong!  The info page on amazon is also wrong!,1149552000,7,371,4.140845070422535
7879414,4,6304744633,"I felt compelled to write this review after reading the comments of the guy below who was warning people not to buy this fine film, or get 'ripped off'. Come on folks, this is ten dollar celluloid  with the title 'Drunken Wu-Tang'....anybody looking for Citizen Kane should've figured out this movie wasn't for them. Yes it has porcupine-man, a crotch-biting watermelon robot, an old woman who fights with a smoking pipe, and a drunken fool who drives a rat cart....but I'm supposed to think these are bad things?!?!? If I were stuck on a VCR equipped desert island with only this movie and 'The Story of Ricky' I think I'd be just fine, thank you.",986947200,,648,4.6347826086956525
7879415,5,6304744633,"""Drunken Wu Tang"", the greatest martial arts movie ever made! It's a rip-roaring tale of martial mayhem, as the Wu Tang clan find themselves employing every crazy stunt in the book in order to combat groin-munching monsters, handheld cluster bombs, giant pipe kung fu, and the spiky antics of porcupine back.  Don't miss the Yuen Brothers in their greatest adventure ever.  This is the tale of one ""Old Devil"", who was banished to the under world for some unknown and most likely insane reason, who is now back and on a quest to capture the ""secret documents"" and the only one who can stop him is one ""Drunken Old Fool"" who can't put down the bottle (or gourd) and drives around in a yellow rat mobile.  There is no real plot or reason to this movie, but its total randomness and insane action scenes are the best to be found in any b rate kung fu movie.  If you are into these types of films or if you just need a good laugh, this is the movie to see.",986601600,,952,4.301675977653631
7879416,4,6304744633,"Li Yi Min stars as a young student of a drunken master, who gets caught up in some trouble with a group of masters, and a Nomad expert.  After being delt a good beating, he returns to his teacher to learn a secret style that will guarentee him redemption.  Good action, and some cool bad guys, including a sharp, and deadly snake style master. very entertaining.",971913600,2,362,4.46969696969697
7879417,5,6304744633,"This movie is one of the most insanely entertaining films I have ever seen!  Chinese mythology on an acid trip.  Copious wire work, hysterical dialogue and frenetic action.  Nothing in this movie makes sense.  At one point a character wins thru the use of the, ""world's largest knife!!!"" being a blade twice the size of her body!!! ha!  pick it up, but don't take seriously as an action movie!",969494400,5,393,4.63768115942029
7879418,1,6304744633,"Please don't do what i did.  When you first glimps at the movie box, you see two long haird men who look pretty interesting.  But once you watch the  movie you realize there not in it.  The movie seems like a martial arts  film meets the muppets.  There are no real exciting fights, instead they  filled the movie with senseless and annoying characters.  Theres the  drunken guy, the Drunken guys friend, the Devil, a crotch biting robot,  Porcupine man, who lasts about 3 minutes ( so what was the point).  Once  you put it in your vcr and hit play, youll begin to feel the cheated, cheap  feeling that im sure many others have felt like me. Viewer beware!  this  movie is awful",965088000,2,679,4.40650406504065
