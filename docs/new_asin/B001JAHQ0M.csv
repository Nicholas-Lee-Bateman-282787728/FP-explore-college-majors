I love this show and even though I have watched the DVDs from the previous seasons over and over, I still always enjoy an Emergency! show.

3653318,5,B001JAHQ0M,I can not remember the exact episodes of this season but as a young child of 10 I very much enjoyed every show that came of on Saturday night at 8 p.m.  If you like watching how our medical history came about.  You will enjoy how it was that we now have parametics and how hard it was for they to start out in Ca.  I still enjoy watchen this show and I will alway will enjoy sitting down to watch Emergency after a long day.  I will never out grow the show that turned me towards the medical field and I have never looked back.  I am very much waiting for season 6 and I can hardly wait for Season 7 and all the 2 hour movies that were made after the series ended.  Enjoy like I have.,1254182400,23,684,3.884892086330935

3653361,2,B001JAHQ0M,"I was a huge fan of the show growing up and I plan to buy the series, but so far the movies are a disappointment.  In contrast to the show where the focus was the rescue process and the actual medical treatments, the movies rely on ""Shock & Awe"" of disasters on a grand scale to drive the story.  The only members of the fire station used are Gage and Desoto, but only for familiarity it seems.  Most of the hospital staff is in the show, but more for decoration.  I've watched 2-1/2 of the 6 movies and the same theme is apparent in all of those with the exception of the third being politically driven and I ended up turning it off after 30 mins.  If you loved the show and never saw these movies you may want to save your money, they are not even remotely similar to the show, BIG DISASTERS, small story without 50% of the familiar faces.  Regret my purchase.  Contact me if you'd be interested in buying my copy.",1499299200,,916,4.2

3653401,3,B001JAHQ0M,"The six TV movies are considered Season 7. Nobody else from Engine 51 shows up as there were contractual issues with those four actors, according to the book: ""Emergency! Behind The Scene"",  the gang at Rampart are only seen in the first two movies (and Robert Fuller only appears in the first one), which are the best of the six (which is being nice). Three of the movies consist of Johnny and Roy going to Seattle and San Francisco and observing other paramedics in action, and they really don't have a lot of dialog. This was a big mistake by the show's producers and writers.

The second movie takes forever to set up and features some really bad 1970s ""disaster of the week"" acting and writing.

Some of these were obvious attempts to resurrect the series in a new location, and it just didn't work for me.  Apparently, not for TV executives, either.  ""Survival on Charter 220"" was the worst of the bunch, with poor acting and poor direction.  The rest were just OK.  ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"" was likely popular when it aired in late 1978...I may have even watched it then.  But, that was back before home video was available.

The remaining stories revolve around the introductions of a new generation of young paramedics and doctors in various West Coast cities that Gage and DeSoto visit -- mostly as visitor/observers. Interactions with our familiar Los Angeles Fire Dept and Rampart General Hospital staff characters become increasingly absent, making this dvd set a bit of a disappointment for us nostalgia hunters; it's just not the same without Dr Brackett.",1470268800,,648,5.300970873786408

Watching these shows is like stumbling into a 1970s disaster-movie-of-the-week, and we only see our heroes in very small doses.  Also, the writing in all six of these 90-minute episodes is pretty atrocious.

That said, any true fan will want to have this collection on the DVD shelf. Of the six episodes, we liked the first and the fourth best. The clip show was highly entertaining.  But these aren't Emergency episodes by a long shot. So go in with low expectations and just be happy for the chance to spend more time with Gage and DeSoto.

3653536,3,B001JAHQ0M,"While I was excited to see The Towering Inferno - the only one of the ""Final Rescues"" I remember seeing on TV during the original run - I was disappointed that all of the movies were as light as they were on ""John & Roy"" time. Most of them focus on some other firefighter/paramedics, as though the creator was searching for a replacement for the original team's 6 year run. (The notable exception is the movie about the trip to Seattle.) None of them used the iconic theme, leaving me with the feeling that these really weren't Emergency! episodes or movies at all. For the most part, the problems in the movies were interesting and the rescues were well done, so this was true to the series. There was as much care and attention to detail in the rescues that characterized the series, showing us the best side of first responders in the mid- to late-70s. It didn't do much to alleviate the annoyances I had with Season 6 of the series, save that it kept us out of Station 51 and the nearly inexplicable change in Cap'n Stanley's behavior. (Maybe between Season 5 and Season 6, the good Cap'n ran one too many [untelevized] rescues with a ceiling falling on his head? )

So, in all, this was a moderately worthwhile purchase because it allows me to complete the collection, but as a 'capstone' to the Emergency! franchise, it just didn't deliver like the series did.",1446508800,3,1366,4.530364372469635

3653569,5,B001JAHQ0M,"These final 'Emergency' movies were quasi-propaganda public advertising campaigns by various Fire Departments and Chiefs (outside LA) who wanted to be on TV and to show off their gear and programs, and are now historical rarities = Like the long gone embarcadero overpasses.

My Dad was 14 years on Rescue Squad 2 in the SFFD (5 as lieutenant) and mostly worked out of 38 Engine on California Street, both of which are shown in the program  - although the 2nd Squad Response shown was in the wrong direction, towards the Pacific Ocean and not the Bay where the Fire was (probably used the same shot twice).

We still have Dad's Plastic 'Civil Defense' Helmets worn by the Actors on the show (one black and one white for officer rank), which were used for a short while back then and found lacking, We have a great photo of Dad in full turnouts at a fire wearing his full gear and the black ""Rescue 2"" Helmet.

As it turns out-the Helmets were bad gear and the shields often melted, and they were replaced with newer models that worked much better; hence the helmets themselves are a rarity in with very few left around.

To see all of this equipment when first put in to service, and the old San Francisco waterfront (before the Loma Prieta Earthquake) along with all the guys working at that time (TV Stars mugged for the cameras, but they used Real SF Firemen as extras) was a real treat.

The Fireboat Phoenix was almost scrapped, until its pumps saved a lot of the Marina District during the Loma Prieta quake when lots of water mains broke. Along with a second boat purchased later they see little use, but in earthquake country in a big harbor - when you need one you really really need that drafting and pumping capacity they displayed

Things have sure changed since then - in some cases for the better (no more open cab engines or riding tailboard) and as for others... The Theme of the SF Show is heavily undercut by a Radical Gender Feminist Political agenda,

Around that time in SF the exploitation of a Staged Racist Hoax was used by then Judge Marilyn Hall Patel (declaring the Department ""Out of Control"" and threatening to Jail the Fire Chief - a brave and honorable man who risked his life for years to protect the people) - when she seized her opportunity and employed the brazen hazardous Hoax like a partisan club with spikes sticking out of it - to bash anyone telling the truth about what went on or getting in the way of Her Own 'fundamental transformation job'.

BTW - these guys were all not choirboys either, but hard working professionals in a very dangerous field. Many had risked their Lives to Defeat the Homo-Nazi Reich in WW-2, and to be tarred by a Federal Judge with use of that type homo-nazi propaganda slime was a Misandrist (Hateful to Men & Boys, Masculinity & Normal Heterosexuality) travesty worthy of the Frisco Courts and those who appointed the judges.

The so called 'swastika-incident' used by Patel was a Fraud created by derelict Fire Safety Inspectors - who had been Faking Safety Inspections (impossible numbers per day) and got caught at it - and then when exposed claimed they had suddenly became the target for 'racist' elements who were allegedly harassing them with swastikas - which conveniently took the Focus off their own endangering the lives of so many citizens through phony inspection claims and made them instant martyrs beyond question - by Anyone..

Although it was Known Throughout the City Administration and its Legal Departments (I know a former lawyer who was on the inside, and although we are on different sides of many fences; that former City Insider even candidly admitted the nature of the scam and the widespread knowledge of the lie downtown and throughout the Courts) - But This was all the Pretext needed by the Radical Misandrist Judge Marilyn Hall-Patel to takeover the Department by threat of use of 'Contempt of Court' as a punishment tool.

Contempt citations require no crime (not that one was ever created - Save for the Hoax) and has no definitive sentence, meaning that although you are innocent of wrongdoing you can be jailed indefinitely. This threat helped keep the Real Story from getting out, and made sure that everyone involved was Afraid, Very Afraid - to utter a word (no matter how true) that Judge Hall Patel could hang them with too

 (BTW - I myself had passed the Court Certified ""Job Relevant / Bias Free"" SFFD entrance exam created at that time, but never got a job; because of the Legal Pogroms of Race / Gender / Anti-Hibernian Revenge against the Hated Herero-Patriarchy Pork Byproducts who needed to be 'fundamentally transformed'  preferably in to compost - were just ramping up to our current age of 'tolerance'.

We have since seen appointment of the likes of the morbidly obese SFFD Chief Joan Hayes White (pretty much seen as a professional joke  with political power if not professional ability) to Chief, though I doubt at her weight could even waddle up an aerial ladder any more, and not keel over.

This Chief of Affirmative action was Promoted in record time, and over far far more Experienced Professionals. Such is the nature of my old hometown of Frisco now, better known to the world today as 'Sodom by the Sea; - which is kind of like the old Barbary Coast, only a lot more cutthroat.

SEE"" Chief Of Department Joanne Hayes-White
Probationary Firefighter to Assistant Chief in 8 Years sworn in by Mayor Newsom as the 25th Chief of the San Francisco Fire Department on January 16, 2004.

3653617,2,B001JAHQ0M,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be like ""the best of Emergency"" all rolled into 6 TV movies.  I was very disappointed.  None of the movies are set at ""Station 51"", and - except for the first movie - Gage and Desoto only play BIT PARTS in the others.

Only the first movie features Gage and Desoto as active participants in the full-length of the rescues.  In the 2nd movie - we only see them for about 10 minutes in the whole film.  In the 3rd, they are visiting in Seattle and are told ""watch - do not DO, or we'll get sued"".  So in that show, they can only help get an IV prepped, carry a couple people, and help with a breech-birth -- OF A COW.  The 4th movie is a clip-job of re-runs from the original series.  This could be good, but they only take the ""choice"" bits which ends up with chopped together shorts of film that run generally less than 3 minutes, with the guys (newly made Captains) sitting around and reminiscing in between ""flash-backs"".  The last 2 movies also have them in another state, so all they can do is watch and help a little bit around the edge.

If you are looking for the ""Emergency"" you grew to love on TV --- SKIP THIS DVD, and just order a season or 2 of the show.  If you absolutely HAVE TO HAVE everything related to ""Emergency"", then buy this - but prepare to be let down.",1411084800,8,1313,4.150197628458498

3653620,1,B001JAHQ0M,"The made for TV movies were a try by Jack Webb to sell a follow-on series to Emergency! set in either San Francisco or Seattle (with the exception of movie #4(flashbacks)). All six fail horribly. Granted, we are looking at these movies nearly four decades later. Still, the dialog was stilted, the acting wooden, the plots formulaic. Movies #1, #2, #3 & #5 had me wanting to gouge my eyes out and stick an ice pick in my ears. Movie #6 tried to make DeSoto look sophisticated. The music had nothing in relation to the action on the scene in any of the movies. Engine 51 is not in this set (except in #4). Squad 51 makes brief appearances in movies #1, #2. Heck, Johnny and Roy are barely in movies #1, #2 and #3. These movies have only DeSoto and Gage to tie them to the series. On a side note, you do get to see a young John de Lancie and Rosalind Chao before they became famous in Star Trek: The Next Generation a decade later.
All in all, a waste of plastic. Save your money and watch these (if you must) on Hulu Plus.",1410480000,2,1021,4.187817258883249

3653633,3,B001JAHQ0M,"The tone and tint of the stories were not the same as the original series. There was little to no reaction between the old squad 51 crew and the other members of station 51. The emergency scenes were not as good as the original. What made the original series work was the repartee' between the crew at rampart general and the squad crew coupled with an emergency and the crew of station 51. The staged scenes in the DVD version, especially the aircraft accident on disc 1 were terrible as no downed aircraft looks like the staged version as they are torn to bits. Finding the small aircraft that collided with a jet liner in the LA canal with little or no damage was ludicrous... I know how the old TV series were portrayed, because I recently completed watching all 111 episodes on Netflix..It is misleading to advertise Randolph Mantooth as he appeared very little. The rehash of old scenes were the best episode on disc two. It was disappointing as the advertised dialogue was not the same as the old series with poorly faked scenes.

3653634,4,B001JAHQ0M,"I grew up watching the series. I own the series on DVD. And my collection would not be complete without the final chapter in the lives of my favorite fiefighter/paramedics, John Gage and Roy DeSoto.
Luckily, there was ""closure"" to the series, unlike other series of the day or even today. The main reason that there were even these two-hour movies with Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin TIghe) was due to the fact that the studio had a contractual obligation to both actors. The series ran for 6 seasons and their studio contracts were for 7. The studio came up with the idea of 6 two-hour movies that would complete the series. For the actors, at least but not necessarily for the fans.

The 6 two-hour movies included touches of the then current genre of disaster movies. The first being: ""The Steel Inferno."" The second being: ""Survival on Charter #220."" Both paid homage to the big 1970's disaster movies, ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Airport '75"".

The complete movie titles on the DVD are:
""The Steel Inferno"", aired on January 7, 1978.
""Survival on Charter #220"", aired on March 25, 1978.
""Most Deadly Passage"", aired on April 4, 1978.
""Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"", aired on December 31, 1978.
""What's A Nice Girl Like You Doing..."", aired on June 26, 1979.
""The Convention"", aired on July 3, 1979.

All of the movies are entertaining but in the last 2, Johnny and Roy are just observers and don't perform any real rescues like on the series.

But to get your ""Emergency!"" ""fix"", this DVD will work. I watch it over and over along with my DVD series collection quite a bit.
For the diehard ""Emergency!"" fan, this will complete your DVD collection. I'd also recommend buying ""Emergency! Behind the Scenes"" book by Richard Yokley and Rozane Sutherland, as well. Both are worth the money.",1400544000,4,1815,4.770700636942675

There are some really great scenes included, and all of them are with Randy and Kevin!

The first one is a nice take-off on the series, which I always loved (watching it on Netflix now), The second one shows Roy and Johnny being promoted and mainly remembering in flashbacks the old days. We also get to see Dr. Bracket, Dr. Early and the sexy nurse Dixie at Rampart Hospital again. Quite a few hours of entertainment for any ""Emergency fan"". The price on Amazon can't be beat - cheaper than a single movie ticket. This show might be an oldie but the story lines and actions have been repeated in several later TV shows yet none of them (in my opinion) have ever topped the original series. Will always be one of my favorites!",1368316800,,673,4.392

3653676,4,B001JAHQ0M,"After the NBC series Emergency was cancelled after its sixth season, the program returned for six, 2 hour, made for TV movie specials, broadcast during 1978, and 1979.  These six adventures, are featured in Emergency: The Final Rescues, a two disc set.

While the fire fighting and rescues scenarios featured in these movies will seem familiar to those acquainted with the series, the focus of these adventures is very different from the original series.  While LA Fire Department paramedics John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe), remain the central characters, none of the original members of Squad 51 appear in these movies, except in flashbacks.  The characters associated with Rampart General Hospital, are present live in only the first two of the specials.

While the dynamic between Johnny and Roy is mostly intact, they are for the most part, functioning in different and unfamiliar environments.  For some fans, the new perspectives on these characters will be interesting, while others may be yearning for the old familiar Squad 51/Rampart situation.  With DeSoto and Gage interacting with what are a series of strangers, and often in the role of visiting observers, there is a bit of a disconnect with the action, and the same kind of camaraderie and teamwork that was present in the TV series, isn't quite there.

As Emergency had already been cancelled, coming back with more of the same probably did not make much sense, even so, some of the stories do venture away from what made Emergency a success, and get involved in the personal lives of some of the guest stars.  While the ""heart"" found in the original series may be lacking, the technical aspects and special effects remain exceptionally solid.  The fires are real, and buildings and other structures, are really burning.  Working with explosives and fire, there is always an element of danger, and Emergency has always done a stellar job of dramatizing fire rescue situations.

Some of the stories may seem really familiar, ""borrowing"" elements from familiar sources, like The Towering Inferno, and Airport `75.  ""Most Deadly Passage"" features the paramedics facing a crisis on the water while in Seattle, and in the ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"", DeSoto and Gage are promoted to the rank of Captain, and then reminisce over a series of excerpts from the series.

The final two movies are set in San Francisco, where Gage and DeSoto work with the same group of emergency personnel, including two female paramedics.  It's a great setting, and the productions make good use of locations like the Golden Gate Bridge, and the waterfront areas.  With no official standing, the LA paramedics have little control over what happens, but still manage to get involved in some action.  With nearly 100 minutes to fill, lots of attention is given to personal issues, but when the action does occur, there are some spectacular explosions, and huge fires involving chemicals and other hazardous materials.  Under fire, during a police standoff, Roy and Johnny help deliver a baby.

Although The Final Rescues do not have the same tone of the original series, and John Gage and Roy DeSoto are somewhat removed from the frontlines, diehard fans may want to see how they finished their distinguished careers.  Emergency was a program that was entertaining and exciting, but it was also concerned with furthering the development of the then fledgling paramedic program.  Our current EMS programs, probably owe Emergency some debt, for supporting and raising public awareness of the paramedic program, in the early days of its existence.  And who knows how many viewers, were influenced to become firemen or paramedics, because of the series.",1367712000,,3719,5.102310231023102
3653677,5,B001JAHQ0M,"This is the way the Emergency should have been all along! These Final Rescues are well written, with big budgets. The Emergencies are full of drama and great effects!

Mantooth and Tighe!  It was a great cast....I liked the Station 51 crew also!  I wish Universal had included the 2 part episode shown in December 1975 in this DVD.  It was part of season 5...they did not include it in the DVD for that season either.  My biggest objection was that the final 6 films did not include any of the supporting cast from the show...except in flashbacks. The films did not really connect to the series.  Sometimes, when trying to keep down the expense a series requires, the quality is sacrificed.  Mantooth and Tighe were major players, but the supporting cast pulled things together.  Eliminating them was a mistake.",1366761600,,763,4.952755905511811

They were ok, but he didn't really like them the way he liked the series (he carries his Emergency DVD's around with him like a first aid kit, just in case he needs them). Some are better than others (the first one is the worst), but he was very disappointed that the supporting cast was not in any of them, and kept asking ""Where's captain stanley? Where's Marco?"" There were lots of things blowing up and catching fire, which he did enjoy. Also, from the adult perspective, I liked the ones that illustrated the differences in how paramedic/EMS programs developed in different places around the country in the 1970's(this was of no interest to the 6-year-old, however). These are ok. Not as good as the regular series.",1365724800,3,779,4.693430656934306

As far as I am concerned, The show ended with the last episode of season 6. These are not the same and some of them are poorly acted and written. The one where they first go to San Francisco was boring me to death until the boat fire in the last 20 minutes. I got it to complete my collection but it is seriously lacking in most areas. They are Poorly cast, have second rate actors, and have really bad writing along with very boring plot lines that drag on like a blade. The first 2 movies where they are in La county with the plane crash and the high rise fire are not too bad but when they go out of town it is just plain bad. Johnny and Roy are not the whole picture. All the guys from the station, the staff at the hospital, and how they worked together is what made this show special.",1360108800,4,942,3.8860103626943006

3653694,3,B001JAHQ0M,"I really enjoyed seasons 1-6 of Emergency but to be honest these were a little disappointing. The movies were mainly created because the two main stars were still under contract, and they were shows to introduce new shows. Johnny and Roy had very small parts in these ""episodes."" They were each about an hour and a half, maybe a little longer, and some of them half of the episode is the engines driving to the accident. Some are better then others of course.

It brought back wonderful memories of episodes and made me proud of the work I did there. While yes, it does date me, it also makes me happy to still see these shows on TV.

The greatest rescues are a highlight of some of the rescues from the seasons of the show so all about the two and the original cast.  The two movies based in San Francisco seem kind of out of order because they are not captains yet; but they are in the movie more than the first two movies. They only help with the rescues though.  The ratio of them in the scenes is about the same as the series when they divided the time between the hospital and the rescues.  As others reported, the crew of 51 are not in the movies except for the ""greatest rescues"" because they are the flashbacks of previous rescues.

They lack the overall quality of the original show - the way the people interact with each other - the drama, mixed at times with humor.
More like just another ""Movie of the Week"".
In two of the movies you see only a few of the original hospital staff & their roles are very limited.  Even Roy and John are not in the action the way you expect them to be.
I won't go into too much detail for those who have not seen it.

In fact Johnny and Roy weren't really seen a whole lot in those eposides either. It was good show but not as good as if the whole gang had been there.,1317254400,,486,4.180851063829787

Partly my fault, I didn't read the information about the disc set or the reviews, I just thought, hey another season of the show I grew up watching each week, then over and over while it was in syndication. I had thought it would be a few more hour long episodes, not a bunch of mini-movies that mostly did not even involve any real action with Johnny and Roy, and nothing with the original 51 cast from both the station and at Rampart, which while the focus was on Roy and Johnny, most of the mini-movies hardly focused on their efforts at all, with the exception of the mini-movie recounting of some of the more famous Emergency rescues that Johnny and Roy were in, but like the rest of you, I am sure you recall most of those rescues/fires, I did. But, that mini-movie was really the only one that interested me mainly because of them bothing parting ways as captains and reliving the best and worst times between they had together, and you could see the cameraderie they both shared at the end of that 4th mini-movie.  The boat and dome rescue in Seattle was a joke, Roy and Johnny hardly even got to do anything because they were just there to 'observe'.

All in all sadly to say, not worth the money, except possibly just for the one famous rescues mini-movie if you want to pay approx. $30 just for that one.",1312243200,,1444,4.376865671641791

Sadly, they were both disappointing and I'm not sure I'm going to watch the rest.  The Greatest Rescues were anything but.  I think they picked the most boring out of the 6 seasons, and there were a lot to pick from.  I also agree with another review I read elsewhere...why not have some commentary by the stars themselves on this episode?  What a missed opportunity.  Universal really dropped the ball on that.

They seemed like they were pilots for new series.  The movies also seemed to be out of order in that one of the movies in the middle had John and Roy promoted to captain and the remainder had them back as paramedics.

3653761,4,B001JAHQ0M,"I just watched all the ""movies"" for the first time since they aired in the late 1970s.

First of all, each movie is 1 hour 36 minutes actual running time.

The first one, ""Steel Inferno"" is actually quite good. It contains LOTS of fire-figthing action and rescue scenes. The fire sequences were actually BETTER than those in Towering Inferno in my opinion! It appears they had a good budget to work with, and made the fire scenes VERY realistic. And you only have to wait 20 minutes for the major action to start.

""Survival on Charter #220"" wastes over an hour's time before the action kicks in. Too much fluff and uninteresting material here. Once the planes crash, then things get interesting.

""Most Deadly Passage"", where Roy & Johnny visit the Seattle Fire Department to compare their paramedic program to the L.A. County's program spends too much time with personal stuff and unexciting rescues at the Kingdome and Space Needle [not an actual rescue at that]. The Ferry boat fire is a letdown in my opinion.

""Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"" is a bunch of flashbacks of Roy & Johnny from previous seasons while being promoted to Captains. Nothing much new or exciting here.

""What's a Nice Girl Like You?"" is the first of two movies filmed in San Francisco, and spends most of the time following the actions of a S.F.F.D. fire station crew and two female paramedics before a major fire on a pier, which is fairly exciting.

The last film,The Convention, has Roy & Johnny returning to San Francisco, and following around the same cast from the last movie. This time, the final fire is a big explosion at a chemical lab working with toxic chemicals & radioactive materials. This was the best action since the fire in ""Steel Inferno"".

If you are expecting to see lots of Roy & Johnny, you will be disappointed.  Engine 51 does not appear at all. The staff at Rampart appears in the first two movies, but their roles are rather limited, with no real drama for them to deal with.

Personally, I like this set of t.v. movies for ""Steel Inferno"", the airplane crash / fires, and the fire at the end of ""Convention"".

If you are looking to relive the ""true"" Emergency! series, you may be let down.

However, if you want lots of action, and are less concerned with who is involved in it, you may really enjoy some of these ""movies""...especially ""Steel Inferno""...sort of a ""mini Towering Inferno"".",1303603200,,2396,4.678571428571429
3653762,4,B001JAHQ0M,"For six seasons, ""Emergency!"" took millions of viewers inside the world of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, as firefighter/paramedics John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) faced new dangers and challenging rescues each week.  The show inspired many people to become paramedics, firefighters and doctors in real life, and also spawned an animated spinoff, ""Emergency 2+2"".

""The Final Rescues"" is a set of six feature-length made-for-TV movies that bring about a fitting end to the series.  Although Gage and DeSoto have minor roles in three of the films, their presence is most assuredly felt.  Whether they are in familiar Los Angeles or visiting with crews in San Francisco or Seattle, they're always on the scene and ready to lend a hand.

Of the six movies in this group, ""Survival on Charter #220"" is my personal favorite.  Not only did it feature most of the original ""Emergency!"" cast - except Robert Fuller, who played Dr. Brackett - it was a eerie case of art predicting life.  The horrific PSA Flight 182 crash occurred in San Diego just six months after ""Charter #220"" aired, and as in the movie, involved a large passenger jet colliding with a small private plane.

My second favorite movie of the group is ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"", a retrospective show in which Gage and DeSoto, now captains and no longer eligible to work as paramedics, relive some of their most memorable adventures.  Those who've never actually watched ""Emergency!"" can watch this movie and get a good understanding of what the show was all about.

There are some before-they-were-stars turns in these six movies as well, including Linda Gray (""Dallas""), Larry Manetti (""Magnum, P.I.""), and John de Lancie (""Star Trek: The Next Generation""), who shows up in three films - ""The Steel Inferno"" (as an actor looking for his wife in a burning high-rise), ""What's A Nice Girl Like You Doing..."" and ""The Convention"" (as a San Francisco doctor mimicking the roll of Dr. Brackett back in Los Angeles).  Some old veterans from the series, including William Boyett (as Captain Stanley's old rival, Chief McConnike) and Vince Howard (as the ever-present Los Angeles County Police officer), are also on hand.

""The Final Rescues"" are a fine capstone to an influential and popular series that was among the best of its time.",1303516800,,2330,5.007772020725389

If you want to reminisce about your fond childhood memories of Johnny, Roy, and the rest of station 51's crew, then don't buy this dvd set.  Instead buy one of the others dvd sets from season 1-6.  These movies were quite boring.  While Johnny and Roy were in them, they mostly played small roles.  The music was different too.  There were no Chet, Marco, Mike, or Captain Stanley.

I did think the Seattle episode ""Most deadly passage"" was a well written and well done epeisode, and although "" Steel Inferno"" had some great guest stars , like Linda Gray ,and the very attractive Anne Lockhart, I felt this movie seemed to drag on a bit on the action, and seemed a bit repititious.

As someone in a previous review pointed out, even Johnny and Roy weren't in them much.  I couldn't care less about any of the characters in these movies. Yes, by this time the writers must have been running out of ideas, but I'd still rather have seen Marco, Mike, Chet and Hank.

3653782,3,B001JAHQ0M,"How does a weekly TV series morph into a handful of TV movies?  There were three things going on at once here.

First, after six seasons what sort of rescue hadn't these guys done?  That episode in season six where the guys play basketball for about twenty minutes was the shark-jumper.  I imagine the cast and crew were up for trying something new at that point.

Second, in the mid-seventies cable TV hadn't taken off yet, so the networks were not only competing with each other, but also with movie theaters, especially on the weekends.  Their biggest weapon in this battle was the TV movie, which was usually mediocre, but had the virtue of being free.

And in the mid-seventies TV nearly did kill off cinemas in the US.  Westerns were dead and during the VietNam era war movies were out of fashion.  This left Hollywood macho with few options, thus the disaster movie was born.  It started with ""Airport"" in 1970, which divided like a bacteria to produce Airport '75, Airport '77, and Airport '79.  One of the biggest disaster flicks was ""The Towering Inferno"" in 1974.

These disaster movies were very formulaic.  You spend an hour getting to know (and either love or hate) the innocent bystanders, then - WHAM!  Disaster strikes, and for the rest of the film the audience plays ""Guess Who Croaks.""  You can see why Star Wars was such a big deal.

Anyway, ""The Steel Inferno"" and ""Survival on Charter 220"" clearly follow the disaster film plan.  Roy and Johnny have to take a back seat so the victims' characters can be developed.  This is disappointing, but the emergency response action scenes are as good as ever.

As an Emergency! fan, this is the last of the DVD sets I would buy.",1294963200,37,1691,4.614093959731544
3653783,5,B001JAHQ0M,"Although there is a lot of good information about the movies provided here, a few things do need to be clarified:

A. Greatest Rescues did not run midway through Season 6. It ran in the fall of 1978, after the first three movies had aired in the previous season and before the two San Francisco movies ran in 1979. What the reviewer is thinking of is a two-part episode in Season 6 in which the series pilot was recut with scenes of Johnny and Roy recalling the pilot as the past.

It is true that none of the other Station 51 firefighters are in the movies, and that Johnny and Roy have a small part in Survival on Charter No. 220, but they are prominently featured in all the other movies, although other paramedics are also featured because the movies were serving as pilots to relaunch Emergency with a new cast.

While I agree that Survival on Charter No. 220 is pretty  bad, and may be the worst Emergency! ever made, the other films are decent quality episodes. The Steel Inferno was jarring because the gang from Engine 51 was not there, but if you watch it knowing that is the case, it is a decent quality episode. The Seattle movie is one of the best Emergency! episodes ever and many fans put it in their Top 10. The San Francisco movies are decent, although not as strong as the Seattle movie.

It would have been neat if Universal had put the Sierra episode featuring Johnny and Roy on here because it is the missing episode for true fans. Now we will have to lobby universal to release the Sierra season in order to get the last Johnny and Roy adventure.",1293667200,5,1568,4.374570446735395
3653784,5,B001JAHQ0M,"This will complete the collection. I will pre-order this.

I purchased ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"" on VHS when JEMS carried it.  You really see how Johnny and Roy worked together as partners, and after going through their adventures for six years, the bonding that took place. They looked out for each other, and worked as a team.  My favorite line is, ""Were going to be staying in touch with one another.  Right, it's not like we are moving out of town or anything.  We are still here, still in the same department, still friends.""  I was a little kid when I saw this episode on December 31, 1978, and nearly cried that Johnny and Roy were departing ways.

About six years ago, a local independent showed re-runs, and I purposely stayed up late the week the movies were shown.  I felt OLD seeing the San Francisco EMS ambulances, because the manufacturer no longer makes those ""converted Winnebago ambulances"", and San Francisco EMS no longer exists - it merged into the San Francisco FD sometime in the 1990's.  Another part that made me laugh really hard was when the Haz-Mat unit showed up at the chemical explosion - that Hazardous Materials gear looked useless.

I read that the idea was for R.A. Cinader to resurrect ""Emergency!"" at a different location, and the San Francisco movies were intended as pilots for a spin-off (unfortunately, NBC didn't pick it up).  The format of San Francisco seemed like a good place to do this, where the filming crew could spend a third of the time on Rescue (at the fire station), a third of the time at the hospital (note that John De Lancie from Star Trek played a doctor), and the rest on the ambulance.  I remember the discussion of navigating San Francisco streets, which are narrow and hilly.  I would think a medium duty truck size ambulance body (International or Freightliner) today would have a hard time, but a Ford E450 Type III would probably be OK.

The Seattle movie was good too, although I felt OLD at the King Dome rescue - since the King Dome was imploded sometime in the 1990's.  This was also before Starbucks and Microsoft took off in Seattle too - 500,000 population in 1978. I was also glad to see that Harborview was mentioned , since Seattle got the Medic One program up and running in 1969. During that episode, I appreciated the discussion on the ""tiered system"", when Rocky and Swede explained to Johnny and Roy the difference between the Aid Units (BLS) and the Medic Units (ALS). Rocky and Swede served on a Medic Unit, and this discussion was probably intended to explain the ""tiered system"" to the audience, since different cities do different things.  My current city runs fire department ALS ambulances (paramedic engine companies are around too - most cities in the past 20 years have implemented them), and the paramedic program didn't start here until circa 1974.  Several cities (like Fort Worth, Pittsburgh, and Boston) currently run third service EMS transport, much like San Francisco did until 1997.

The Journal of Emergency Medical Services (JEMS) has a DVD titled The History of Modern EMS:  Making a Difference 2.0 that can be found for purchase.  The impact of the Emergency! TV series is mentioned in here.",1292716800,41,3203,4.747292418772563

3653787,4,B001JAHQ0M,"The facts regarding some of the sequences and airings of the telefilms are incorrect.

EDITED 1/26/11  First and foremost, ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"" was not originally aired during the season of all the telefilms, rather it was actually aired in December of 1976, about midway through season 6. It was different than the others in that the closing credits were similar to the end of the regular episodes with the paramedic badge. All the movies in the final season, had the end credits superimposed over the last scenes. Another reviewer stated that I was (possibly) confusing the re-airing of the pilot episode, which when repeated, was aired as an extended 2 part episode, but Roy and Johnny were not reminiscing as they are in this episode. I actually still have the old reel to reel that confirms this as it was a 2 hour time slot and there was a couple commercial breaks that included TV spots for King Kong (which opened in December of 1976) as well as other movies that were playing at the time. I also have an old Beta that has it repeated in December of 1977 (not 78 as listed in most online episode guides, this time with commercials for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which opened in Dec of 1977)  -- END OF CORRECTIONS

The Steel Inferno actually introduced us to another Squad and Station and featured only a few of the Doctors of Rampart
Julie London(Dixie McCall)and husband, Bobby Troup,(Joe Early) and I think Ron Pinkard wa also in it.(Dr. Morton).  The station is near the harbor and features two young paramedics, one of them is late coming back from a vacation with his fiancee (Anne Lockhart later of Battlestar Galactica ""Sheba"") A highrise building is still a few floors under construction and a careless paint crew starts the fire. There are a few sequences of Roy and John, but Engine 51 crew is not featured at all, and Roy and John are not the main duo in this film. Some footage sequences came from earlier Universal movies
Air date  1/7/78

Survival on Charter #220 - This is the first 2 hour episode with more of John and Roy, sharing the time with their C shift counterparts. John and Roy respond to a call where a child, the daughter of a firefighter that was killed in the line of duty, was injured in a neighborhood game of baseball. While there, a plane carrying the governor of california (no not Arnold) collides with a small plane ( some of the effects and plot points are the SAME used and recycled from Universal's Airport 1975)and crashes in the same neighborhood that Roy and John are assisting the child, the squad is crushed, this is the last time the squad is seen in an emergency episode (it does not appear in any of the other telefims- remember, Greatest Rescues aires before any of the telefilms) Air date  3/25/78

Most Deadly Passage  - Roy and John travel to Seattle Washington where they accompany the Seattle's station's Medic One crew to an accident in the Kingdome and observe when a skydiver gets medical attention after jumping off the Space Needle They also split up with the Medic One personnel and  venture out to the suburbs and watch as a cow gives birth and then assist the SFD in a major rescue when one of the ferry boats catches fire in the sound. Air date 4/4/78

What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing?.......  Roy and John travel to San Francisco where they find that women are rising in the ranks of the SFFD as medics. Similar to Seattle, they are observing the practices of the medics in San Fran and there is another boat disaster.  Air Date 6/26/79

The Convention -  Roy and John return to SFO and attend a Parmedic convention in SFO.  I don't remember this one other than there is a man who gets trapped in the riggings of a large boat and John and Roy reunite with the paremedics from their previous visit and tag along on some rescues. Air Date 7/3/79

This is the correct sequence of the series telefilms. The Greatest Rescues of Emergency may have been re-aired on 12/31/78 as some TV episode guides suggest but it had first aired, as stated earlier,  in the 1976-1977 during the 6th season run.  In fact UNIVERSAL was asked why it was not included with Seaason 6 DVD set and although no answer was given, it was assumed that it would be more fitting to be included in the final DVD set which was not confirmed, but there was speculation that it would be a set containing all the telefilms.  Now lets hope its the actual 2 hr versions and not the syndicated 2 part versions. A few years back, a video company called JEMS, had released VHS tapes with the movies and different edits of some episodes.",1286755200,6,4586,4.54126213592233

3653789,4,B001JAHQ0M,"Warning:  some possible spoilers in this review.

After Emergency! finished its 6 year TV episode run, the show then had 6 ""made for TV"" movies that were released in 1978 (the year following the last season of Emergency!) and 1979.  So, technically, this is not ""Season 7"", although there is about 12 hrs. worth of programming on this set.  It would be cool if they released the Emergency +4 cartoons with this final movie set - but I seriously doubt that will happen.

These movies included:

""Survival on Charter 220"" - where a small plane collides mid air with a larger passenger jet.  They land in a neighbor and the havoc ensues.  If I'm not mistaken, Squad 51 is crushed by a part of a plane and Johnny and Roy are trapped inside a house. (2 hr. movie)

""The Steele Inferno"" - basically a high rise building fire stretched into a 2 hr. movie.

""What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing?"" - Johnny and Roy travel to San Francisco. (2 hr. movie)

""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"" - Johnny and Roy are promoted to Captain and reminisce about their days on the squad.  The movie is made up mostly of flashback scenes from the TV series, but it is still nice to see Johnny and Roy promoted to Captain (2 hr. movie)

""Most Deadly Passage"" - Johnny and Roy travel to Seattle (2 hr. movie)

""The Convention"" - Johnny and Roy return to San Francisco (2 hr. movie)

For those who have never seen these two hr. movies, be forewarned that you don't see A LOT of Johnny and Roy in most of these movies (with the exception of ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"" - where you see A LOT of Johnny and Roy - but this ""movie"" consists mostly flashbacks).  In fact, there are a number of very long segments in the other movies with no Johnny and Roy.  Some of the movies almost come across like they were trying to create a spin off series - because so LITTLE time is spent with Johnny and Roy and so much time is spent with new characters.  Further, you won't be seeing any of the other fireman from the series on these TV movies - so no Chet, no Cap, no Marco.  You do get to see the Rampart medical staff a bit.

Personally, I am not very fond of these TV movies (with the exception of ""Greatest Rescues"").  Remember, when I say this, I am a HUGE Emergency! fan.  I grew up watching the TV show.  I owned a Squad 51 helmet, an Emergency! Jigsaw puzzle, etc. and soon all of the TV seasons on DVD (as soon as Season 6 comes out).  I personally met Randolph Mantooth in 2001 (along with other crew members from the show) when Code 3 Collectibles was dedicating their new Emergency! toys at Station 127 in Carson (the station used for the TV series) - got to sit in the refurbished squad.  I have visited the station 3 times in the last several years.  This is my favorite show of all time (along with the Saint and Mission Impossible) - but these TV movies, honestly, put me to sleep.  In my opinion, they are slow moving and have too little of our favorite cast from the series.  I will probably buy this set to complete the series, but IMHO, you aren't missing much if you don't own them - but perhaps some of you enjoyed these movies.

While these final movies haven't been released yet, don't expect much in the video quality if the last few seasons are any indication.

Hope this ""preview"" or review helps.  But, remember, at the time I am writing this review, the set has not been released yet.",1264896000,237,3375,4.326433121019108

8312284,5,B001JAHQ0M,"OK, so I got my series completing DVDs for the original Emergency TV show from when I was a kid in the 70s. I ordered it despite some of the negative reviews people have posted online for the finale.

The majority of the complaints from people who bought the series completion set complained about the fact that the main characters weren't in the episodes very much and it seemed like these were something meant to premiere a possible new show that the network wanted to try out.

So heres the skinny on that for both those of you who think this and for those who might be put off by the reviews that said that.

You have to remember that when this show was on before syndication, these episodes played out once a week just like today's shows. We saw John and Roy every week fighting fires, saving lives and the rest of the crew doing their parts every single week. These final little episodes listed here were shown every once in a while as a special on TV. Youre sitting down and binge watching these shows one after the other like me. This is probably after you have binge watched the original seasons already and now your used to seeing the regular cast just like before.

In some cases the fact that the main characters weren't in the episode as much might have been to show case a possible new series that the network wanted to put out. But at the time, when these episodes aired, that was Ok as we were already used to seeing the main cast on a regular basis. We didn't get to binge the entire series in one night at our leisure. We had to wait a week at a time.

So if your buying this to complete your set like me (Wondering WHY they didn't just put this in with the regular season in the first place like me) I recommend this set.

Youll get the specials that we remember such as the one where the air liner crashes in the city, and the high rise fire that the studio either got the idea from the movie Towering Inferno or inspired it.

Just when you're watching, keep in mind that these are being seen out of context for the seasons as they were sold separately form the season packs. And get ready to enjoy the final piece of the puzzle that was Emergency.",1522972800,,2168,4.273170731707317
