8482272,5,B003RY48LI,"I teach Mandarin as a second language at a local Chinese school. I choose different materials for my students in the classroom. ""Learning Chinese is Fun!!"" is one of them. My students enjoy this one. Sometimes they asked me to play ""Learning Chinese is Fun!!"" for them. They said they liked the stories. In my view, ""Learning Chinese is Fun!!"" imparts knowledge in a natural and kind way which students will not reject or feel unreal. And also it's interesting. I forgot to mention that my students are 8 to 11 years old.",1337472000,,521,4.612903225806452
8482273,5,B003RY48LI,"The program was both educational and entertaining for my children - a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old. My 2-year-old started to pick up a few Mandarin words after watching it for the first time. And my 5-year-old, who already knows some Mandarin,learned how to write a few Chinese characters. They also liked the story telling, most of which centered around ancient Chinese stories and moral values. I'd highly recommend it!",1281744000,,420,5.101449275362318
