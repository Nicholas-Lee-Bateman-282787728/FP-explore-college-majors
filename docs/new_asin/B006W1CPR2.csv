8505282,5,B006W1CPR2,"I agree that this workout doesn't have much to do with dancing, so it might be slightly misleading...nonetheless it is a flowing yoga workout...
I really like that you can customize the workouts, even though I am usually choosing all parts, except of the introduction...
The warming up is really good, and gets your heart rate up...The workouts really make me sweat and feel great at the same time, because I am literally feeling my muscles working...
The stretching is great as always...I really love that Jennifer Galardi does a really good stretching after her workouts...

And I really have to point out that Jennifers cuing is perfect, you don't have to look up every time, because she really tells you what and how to do next...

After doing this workout for the first time, my back and shoulders were sore - this is one of my weakest body parts...at the same time I was stretched and relaxed...

I would consider myself as an intermediate, working out 3-5x a week (running, yoga and ballet based workouts)...but this workout was a toughie (in a good way)...",1383696000,2,1064,4.7405405405405405
8505283,4,B006W1CPR2,"I first came across Jennifer Galardi in her Ballet Body DVD which was a killer (to begin with) but lots of fun. What I loved about that DVD was that completing the whole workout is tiring, but with the extended stretch session at the end, you leave the workout feeling relaxed and forgetting the hard slog you just went through. Flowetry is similar to Ballet Body in that sense, it's a hard slog followed by some nice stretching. It is hard for those like me who haven't done a lot of yoga and are working on building their upper body strength.

Flowetry is divided into sections so you can either do the whole workout or whichever section tickles your fancy. You can also select which order you want to do the workout in. The DVD's run time is 95 minutes - actual workout time is about 82 minutes.

Here's a brief rundown of each chapter:

Tutorial (approx. 13 mins)
Jennifer provides in depth explanations guiding you through the correct positioning of your body for the following poses:
* Mountain
* Chair
* Plank
*How to move from the four limbed staff (moving from standard high plank with arms straight down to low plank with arms bent and your whole body parallel to and just inches from the floor) to cobra or up dog
* Down dog
* High lunge or crescent
* Warrior I
* Warrior II

I found this tutorial very useful. Can't believe all the things I've been doing incorrectly!

Warm Up (approx. 6 mins)
Concentrating on the breath - Arm raises, legs together squats, plie squats, holding goddess pose with shoulder reach, forward fold, shoulder rolls, one leg squat while stretching the other leg, releves, side stretch with arm raised, arm sweeps. Everything (except your ears!) is stretched and warmed up.

Chair Series (approx. 8 mins)
Chair pose with forward folds and knee bends to stretch out the back of the legs. Chair pose with arm sweeps out to front and then out back with emphasis on the triceps. Chair pose with arms up above the head then twisting the body from side to side. The series ends in a short vinyasa.

Lunge Series (approx. 7 mins)
Starting with a modified vinyasa then flowing into a series of lunges. Note as this is a yoga video the lunge is where you hold the lunge and move your arms or other parts of the body to strengthen and lengthen the body not the multiple of lunges you would find in an aerobics video. In the lunge series, Jennifer has you change from one leg to the other by doing a vinyasa in between the switch.

Core Series (approx. 7 mins)
The core series finds you on the floor on your hands and knees. It is arm heavy with poses such as the standard plank, down dog (hate these!), side plank, upward facing dog, knee to nose and ""awkward airplane"". Fortunately Jennifer allows for stretches (mini breaks) after each series of moves.

Warrior Series (approx. 16 mins)
Starting with cat and cow stretch we flow onto down dog then step up to stand with feet together completing a short breathing session with arm sweeps.  Jennifer then moves onto a vinyasa leading into warrior I then warrior II.  In warrior II you either pulse the bent leg or perform rib cage reaches (isolations). The moves in this series are repeated several times hence the longer chapter time.

Flowetry (approx. 12 mins)
In this section all the moves we have completed previously in the chair, lunge, core and warrior series are pieced together in one long flowing sequence hence the title of the DVD Flowetry.

Stretch and Centre (approx. 24mins)
Jennifer leads you through a lengthy and luxurious stretch session where everything gets stretched. And in the last four minutes or so you are on your back breathing softly through a relaxing/calming meditation.

Jennifer performs the workout in the studio alone with soft white floors and the walls are a nice grey and purple. For yoga I prefer the studio based workout instead of an outdoors setting as I find that distracting when I should be concentrating on the difficult moves. And because Jennifer is alone, there isn't anyone to show modifications though she does advise of a few modifications during the workout. She instructs the video via voice over - I normally do not like this but have found in this DVD it allows Jennifer to keep up with the flow of the workout whilst providing precise instructions - so it works well. Unfortunately though, her cueing is slightly off in some parts so I fall behind in keeping up with her moves on the screen. The workout moves at a steady but not too fast pace. The transition from one pose to the next is smooth and non-jerky. The music is nice and relaxing throughout except for the stretch and relaxation section. Part way through this section, the music changes to what sounds like an airplane flying by and then the ""singer"" (?) sounds like an announcer on the airport terminal's broadcasting system - this unfortunately drowned out Jennifer's voice a bit - awkward airplane indeed!

Note: On the DVD it states; ""The strength of yoga. The beauty of dance.""  This DVD does not include anything from dancing which some may believe from the DVD note. It is a flowing yoga workout and I suppose it flows and moves fluidly like a well choreographed dance.

A little about me: I have been exercising on and off since 2009 - more regularly in the last six months. I started with Pilates mat classes then reformer classes before moving to home workouts (cheaper!) mostly with CRUNCH workouts featuring Ellen Barrett.  I have only attended two yoga classes and what I do know of Yoga is from the CRUNCH: Super Slim down Yoga Pilates Blend DVD with Ellen Barrett. I have all of Ellen's other DVDs which are a blend of fitness disciplines and sometimes borrows bits and pieces from yoga. I also have two basic yoga DVDs: Yoga for Absolute Beginners and Inch Loss Yoga with Susan Fulton - both of which I do not use very often. In terms of Yoga, I would classify myself as a mid-range beginner.

This DVD is hard for me what with the planks and down/up dog poses. I am working on building my upper body strength so I hope in time I will be stronger (and therefore hating down dog less!) and actually able to complete the whole DVD. For the time being, I will follow another workout with this DVD daily or every other day, working on one or two sections at a time until I have built enough strength to do more chapters together. I will skip the Flowetry chapter of the DVD entirely until I've built up the endurance.

In summary, this DVD was what I was looking for.  Not easy, difficult but achievable. It presents a challenge and allows me to work toward a goal. Obviously it's not a cardio workout but gets your heart rate up as you move between poses and work to build strength and maintain good form.

This DVD is for the intermediate to strong intermediate. It may be doable for a beginner to yoga (but the beginner would need to have a strong upper body as there are a lot of planks etc. For those with the upper body strength of a kitten (like me) this workout will be hard. I also recommend you use a non-slip mat so as not strain your shoulders or legs when holding poses. I have to find one without padding as the padding makes it hard to keep my balance!

There wasn't enough information available when I was looking at buying this DVD so I hope this review is of assistance to you in deciding whether or not to purchase Flowetry. I am glad I did - it's the perfect next step from my beginner yoga DVDs and I look forward to one day being strong enough to complete the entire DVD in one go.

If it were possible I would rate this 4.5 stars.",1379721600,10,7562,4.519033674963397
8505284,3,B006W1CPR2,"Jennifer Galardi's Flowetry is what I would call an ""advanced beginner"" workout.  The DVD states that it has over 95 minutes of content, however, when you flip it over and read the back of it there is only 95 minutes of content. The workouts are 10, 15 to 20 minutes in length.  The menu includes :

 An introduction to the workout
 Chair series
 Lunge series
 Core series
 Warrior series
 Flowetry yoga
 Stretch and center
 Tutorial on poses

 First let me start with the positives of the workout-I absolutely loved the music.  It is flowing and the essence of new age yoga type music.  I wish I could buy the music and listen to it to relax at home or in the car.  The editing and the transitions between one workout to another are excellent.  The transition from one menu item to another is a large drop onscreen that forms in water is great. Jennifer's instruction is adequate, with few to no technical yoga terms used.  The tutorial at the end is very helpful to someone brand new to yoga.

 However, I was ultimately disappointed with this workout.  The first extreme disappointment to me was the price of the workout. At 24.95, it is one of the most expensive yoga workouts out there.

 The overall content of the DVD also was very disappointing to me.  I expected a ""flow"" type dance movement yoga video.  Instead, there is very little to distinguish this DVD from other basic yoga videos (that are much cheaper.) I expected the yoga to be in sync to the music as well.  There is very little dance type movements, which is what is advertised on the front of the DVD to me.  Why is it called ""Flowetry"" then if there is little to none of it?

 The set is also incredibly boring to me.  It is Jennifer in what appears to be an excersize studio with no walls or scenery to look at, just Jennifer.  I like yoga to have some scenery to look at besides the instructor.

 In my opinion, there are better yoga DVDs out there for beginners/intermediate/advanced yogis that are cheaper.  Element's ""Hatha/Flow Yoga for beginners with Tamal Dodge"" is excellent, much cheaper, has excellent instruction and is filmed in the outdoors of Hawaii.  For a more advanced person, try anything by Shiva Rea.  She shows more flow/dance moves in her yoga videos that Jennifer Galardi does, and again, her DVDs are cheaper (in the 14.99 to 19.99 range).

 All in all, if Amazon would let me, I would probably rate this DVD 3.5 stars, however, I can't do that, so because I spent so much $$ on this, a product that I will not use much if at all, I will rate this DVD a 3.",1346889600,7,2555,4.45021645021645
8505285,4,B006W1CPR2,"This is a pretty good flow yoga dvd by Jennifer Galardi but I thought it was a little repetitious, in parts. When you think you are done with a section, she repeats it again, 2 or 3 times through. I don't like tifting, so wish she would have not repeated any exercises.

With that being said, you do feel worked out, stretched out, by the end. I would rate this an intermediate to stromg intermeediate, definitely not begin/inter. The Core Series, in particular, can be challenging with your arms in plank, quite a bit.

If you like Jennifer Galardi's style and you like flow yoga, I think you will enjoy it and you will be challenged at some point in the dvd. So, can't wait to give it another try, soon!

**JUST A SIDE NOTE FOLKS: Just want to thank Amazon for their outstanding customer service, support, professionalism, and loyalty to their customers. They are unmatched in this regard. While other company's, such as Collage Video and others, try to mimic them, they just do not stand by even loyal customers who have ordered from them for years nor do they adhere to  policies as claimed on their website. A surprising note in this day and age of such stong competition out there. I would strongly advise ordering from Amazon, as they back their customers 100% and won't let you down. I would much rather spend my hard earned money at a company who appreciates me, then a company who backstabs me, as we all know,  money and time are much to precious to waste on the unappreciative.  There is SO much competition out their and SO many choices as to where to buy your dvds, be wise and give to those who truly deserve it. Thanks Amazon, you are truly, the best of the best!!",1337731200,,1680,4.473856209150327
