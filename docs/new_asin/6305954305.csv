7898090,5,6305954305,"THE LA LAKERS WERE THE BEST TEAM THIS 2000 NBA SEASON AND GOOD RUN THROUGH THE PLAYOFFS AND BEAT THE PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS FOR THE WESTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP AND MADE A GAME 7 COMEBACK IT WAS A MIRACLE, FORGET THE SAN ANTONIO SPURS THAT TEAM SUX... THE LAKERS WERE BETTER",1133740800,,277,4.56
7898091,5,6305954305,"Regardless of what Laker haters may think, the LA Lakers totally deserved their NBA championship in 1999-00. I knew when Phil Jackson got named in as their coach, they would win a title the very same year. Have you noticed why Shaq & Kobe are called ""the combo""? Together on the lakers they pulled a 1-2 punch that was unstoppable. I'll never forget that last play of the Western Conference Finals in 2000 against the Portland Trailblazers. Kobe moves with speed & grace of a running back. When he swerved and cut his way inside by the basket on a layup, I knew that Shaq would slam it in.

The DVD was great but save your money. There is a set out now that will let you relive all the memories (including complete games) of the title runs in 2002, 2001, 2000, 1988, 1987, the earlier 80's as well as a complete game from 1972. It is available on 5 discs for about $50. Why get championship highlights for one year when you get the complete history for the same price. It has this disc on it...",1132617600,,994,4.315508021390374
7898092,1,6305954305,"The only reason this video even exists is because LA got lucky. There was doubt that the Portland Trailblazers were the better team, and they had that Game 7 in the bag, until the officals decided to help the Lakers back into the game so they could have them in the finals to keep the ratings up. No one wanted to see the old Portland Trailblazers in the finals against the Pacers. You had to have the circus freak Lakers in there with Kobe and Shaq to keep the little kids happy. Remember, this was the first full NBA season following the embarressing lockout-shortening season where the ratings took a nosedive.
The Lakers are nothing more then a recycled Chicago Bulls team with Phil Jackson's ENTIRE coaching staff, and a few former Bulls with the likes of Ron harper, Horace Grant, among others. AS a Bulls fan, I was so upset about Phil going to LA, and even more upset about him winning it alongside those punks Shaq and Kobe. Luck ran out on the Lakers this past season when the Spurs waxed them, and I hope it happens again!",1071619200,4,1033,4.442105263157894
7898093,5,6305954305,this is a cool Place to Remember how short ago it was that the Lakers started there Version of DYNASTY!!!! this Video highlights the end results it was a Year that the Lakers went through so much&Grew together. A Big TOAST TO THE CHAMPS&Many More Rings Coming.,1023840000,2,260,4.553191489361702
7898094,5,6305954305,"Lots of higlights, interviews with all lakers players including the coach phil jackson. The dvd higlights the lakers season from preseason to the finals and mention a short story 3 years past when kobe and shaq arrived.
Thou it is an exellent feature of the lakers season it lacks many season highlits wich showed their progress over the season under jackson.
At the finals I expected to see more coverage of the lakers-portland series (which was the real finals, here the lakers got the championship ring), It should have been longer than the lakers-pacers series coverage at the finals.
A must have for a lkaer fan and anyone who loves basketball!!!",1020470400,4,651,4.873873873873874
7898095,4,6305954305,"First of all : I'm not a Lakers fan. I bought this DVD because I love basketball and from the first day i had my DVD Player i wanted to have NBA DVDs. This Edition is a must have for Lakers fans. You have everything : from the regular season to the finals, the parade in LA, featurettes on Kobe, Shaq, Phil Jackson and Ron Harper. One of the things i like the most is the Top 10 plays of the 99-00 season. Maybe I would have liked to have more of the regular season and not so much focus on the finals (you can watch a resume of every game). The image is really good and you have a nice 5.1 mix.",980380800,12,595,3.845528455284553
7898096,4,6305954305,"For most basketball fans - particularly Lakers fans - the pivotal series of the 1999-2000 season was the Western Conference finals between the Lakers and the Blazers. While this video understandably focused on the actual Finals between the Lakers and Pacers, one wishes that there was more coverage of the Lakers-Blazers series, especially the astonishing 15-0 run that brought the Lakers back from the brink of humiliating homecourt extinction in Game 7...
If only the NBA would take advantage of the DVD format, and come out with a COMPREHENSIVE commemorative disc with more game highlights, and options to switch between the disc's soundtrack and actual game commentaries...now THAT would be something to celebrate!",971740800,11,718,5.3628318584070795
7898097,5,6305954305,"This video really well done, with great  interviews, music, and highlights. Pretty well written, too. The tape is a must have for Laker fans.

It put the championship in the framework of the  three most recent playoff failures, starting with Shaq & Kobe's first  year in L.A., and that humilating loss to the Jazz... It does a great job  telling the story of the season, mostly the playoffs.

A few gems from  the tape: -- After the final game, during the celebration, the tape shows  Harper turning to Jackson and asking, ""Can I retire now?""  After  they laugh, he says, ""Don't worry, I'll be back next year..."" --  Lots of great Chick moments, including a line near the end of Game 7 vs.  Portland where he says ""Portland needs to return their Champagne and  get some water, 'cause that's all they're gonna be drinking!"" -- Shaq  torturing an apple on a bus and eating it not unlike Mango from SNL....",966038400,2,903,4.5625
7898098,2,6305954305,"Better than I expected, but still disappointing.  Given the fact that it's made from NBA types (i.e. the guys who produce Inside Stuff or whatever  that Ahmad hosted program is), it's better than you'd think.  There is  still some annoying music here and there, but at least it's somewhat  substantive.  My main complaint though is that they absolutely pay no  attention to critical junctures of the regular season.  All Lakers fans  know that some highlights of the season included two big wins versus  Portland (the first being after Kobe's return with his sweet block of  Pippen's layup, the second being that crucial game in February), and a big  east coast swing where the Lakers destroyed Miami and New York.  But alas,  these significant moments weren't even addressed.  I guess the title of the  video is NBA Finals 2000, so it's understandable why they focused on the  Finals.  But I think I speak for most die-hard Lakers fans when I say that  the Lakers-Pacers series was NOT the highlight of the season, and  definitely (aside from the celebrating, obviously) was not the most  exciting part of the season.  If you're a Lakers fan, you have to like it  and will buy it I guess.  I wish somebody else could have the rights to do  a real documentary.  I mean somebody outside the reach of the official NBA  with its chokehold on all things proprietary.",965779200,10,1362,4.733905579399142
7898099,5,6305954305,"Well, after more than a decade, we finally brought the title back home where it belongs.  As Shaq would say, ""CAN YOU DIG IT! "" Or actually, he would say, ""CAAAAAAN YOOOUUUU DIGGGGGGGIT! "" If  you are eager to replay the highlights of this intense championship series,  it's all here.  Reggie Miller and his squad put up quite a commendable  fight, but in the end, LA was just too powerful of a force to beat! All in  all, it was an exciting series.  What it comes down to is this:  If you're  not a Laker fan, then what are you doing even reading this review?  Come to  think of it, if you are a Laker fan, you don't need to be reading this  review either.  Just buy the video as a keepsake to show your grandkids  someday.  That is, if VHS cassettes are still around...",963878400,,771,4.220689655172414
