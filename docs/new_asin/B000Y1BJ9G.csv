8230683,3,B000Y1BJ9G,I loved this DVD_but it could have been made better if there was a section on how to do craft projects for Christmas_and demos on recipes used during Colonial time. I had hoped for more information of substance to create a Wmsburg themed Christmas Party this year. It was enjoyable.,1221782400,,282,4.66
