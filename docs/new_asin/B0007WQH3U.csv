2247703,2,B0007WQH3U,"I purchased this DVD because it boasts that even a person with two left feet can do it.  Well, I've tried and tried, and she just goes TOO fast.  I'll stick with Tamilee Webb.",1139616000,5,175,4.117647058823529
2247704,3,B0007WQH3U,I agree steps not gone over throughly enough at slower tempo. Dance moves when finally learned hardly made me break a sweat. Hard to dance off the inches if doesn't raise heartbeat. Will still do video though as a warmup for Tae-bo. :),1136678400,5,235,4.488372093023256
2247705,2,B0007WQH3U,"I bought this DVD based on the stellar reviews I have read of it on this site and others.  However, I was sorely dissappointed.  I like the instructor and the fellow exercisers are great.  And, yes, the dances are first taught at a slower pace.  But, the instructor quickly moves it up to tempo 2 and then to tempo three.  The steps are NEVER taught slow enough for me to catch on.  I have to rewind and do tempo one about 10 times before being able to move on to tempo 2.  Tempo 3 is way to out of control for me at this point.  I don't have the steps down enough yet for tempo three.  The instructor just doesn't break down the steps enough.  I was so frustrated after 10 minutes that I turned it off and returned to my trusty Pilates tape.  I have done other dance tapes...it took me two times through to get Crunch's Fat Burning Dance Party (I found that to be an acceptable time frame...I took dance lessons in high school so this isn't new to me and I am am intermediate level exerciser who does lots of pilates and step) and the instructor is much better at breaking down the steps on that video.  The speed never seems too high.  I'll keep trying this tape but it is going to take me while to get these steps down.  It looks fun.  If only the steps were broken down a bit more.",1136505600,15,1285,4.125
2247706,4,B0007WQH3U,"What makes this tape unique is the  3 levels of tempo that appears for each dance segment. It's also good to see a variety of body shapes portrayed. I'm familiar with the instructor and I adore her style and enthusiasm. The stage is a bit stale, yet large enough for her several backup dancers.",1135728000,6,294,4.444444444444445
2247707,5,B0007WQH3U,"She teaches you at a slow tempo first, then she changes to a faster pace, then the tempo 3 which is really fast.

It is a fun video. worth buying it!!",1135641600,5,150,3.838709677419355
2247708,1,B0007WQH3U,"Ok, so i used to be fit but so gained weight over time by stress-eating and very little exercise.  =(  That saying, i used to be a fitness freak:  i'm a member of videofitness (fitness review site), and have done advanced videos such as Firm, Cathe, christi taylor, and marcus irwin.  I thought by doing this video after my 'unfit/fatty' hiatus, I could ease myself getting back to doing fitness video....that is, i thought this would be easy, fun and inspire me.  well, it is none of the above, folks.
Why i dislike this video = why this video lacks so much:
1.  instructor is really bad.  yea, she is the typical peppy gal but she is just too much peppy.  She then becomes too annoying after the first dance step.  She wastes time in useless talk instead of cuing the moves properly.  Oh, yea, the cueing in this video is awful.
2.  Ok, so the instructor isn't the best in teaching.  What makes this video bad too: the moves are taught too quick in the (slower, teaching mode) tempo 1.  You can barely get the moves after 2 tries and then she zooms into tempo 2.  As unfit as i am, i can quickly catch up with marcus irwin and christi taylor's dancey moves when they first teach them --i only get tired with those two b/c my stamina is just lousy.  Maybe if you are a full-fledged dancer who learns quick, maybe you can get these moves.
3.  boring music.

Only thing i liked:  the other ladies in the video.  they seem like a bunch of really pleasant, fun gals to be friends with.

thank goodness i got this ultra cheap.  going to give it away as a gift.  not useful for those getting or trying back to shape.  beginners:  don't let this be your first dvd.",1342483200,,1658,4.29126213592233
2247709,2,B0007WQH3U,"I really have enjoyed some of the other workouts in the Dance Off The Inches DVD series, so I thought that I would like this one as well.  Not so much!!!  I had a lot of trouble learning the moves.  By the time I was getting the hang of them in Tempo 1, the instructor would switch really fast to Tempo 2 and then to Tempo 3.  The three Tempo concept is cool (it's what piqued my interst in the first place), but I don't feel like Julianne Arney gives enough instruction on the moves.  Now I am not a dancer, just an overweight housewife trying to get in shape, but I have never had this much trouble keeping up with an exercise DVD.  If I can't do the moves, I can't work out, so I probably won't be trying this one again.",1333929600,2,723,4.020979020979021
2247710,1,B0007WQH3U,"I liked the instructor and the music and the dances. I'm certain that EXPERIENCED dancers would love the DVD.  I would have given this 5 stars if the instructor had taken more time in teaching the dance steps. It would have been great if she would do each step very slowly several times.  It would have been ever greater if she would turn her back to the viewer as she did the slow demonstrations.  I got so confused trying to keep up and watching her do it watching her front instead of her back.  Any, since that didn't happen, and since I didn't want to take the time to keep rewinding until I got it, I just danced my own dance to the music and decided to get rid of the DVD.  I'm sure it will be perfect for someone else.",1313020800,2,726,4.120567375886525
2247711,5,B0007WQH3U,"Hi,
I'm 38 years old, 5'10"" and 235 lbs.  I used to be very fit and active but gained a lot of weight while suffering from post partum depression.  I've been working really hard to get back into shape and do with videos since it's easier to keep the kid occupied in the house and has been fun for me.
Yes, the steps are challenging to learn, I kept my remote handy to rewind and try again. In the end I feel worked, happy and sweaty.
I danced as a child ballet and tap.  I've been a yoga instructor for 10 years so I have a lot of body awareness.
I can see how this workout could be challenging at first but the instructor is so nice and supportive with practice everyone can be enjoying this.
I love that there is a gal in the back with curves... finally.
p.s. this is on Netflix instant delivery so if you have Netflix, you can try this free on your account.",1272844800,2,860,4.076923076923077
2247712,1,B0007WQH3U,"I rarely like to give negative reviews however I can't help it. Received this in the mail and was eager to try the DVD. Within 5 mins I was helplessly lost, within ten mins I quit. The steps were too complicated for me to follow and too involved. I like simple easy routines however she just kept adding onto each routine one difficult one after the other. Yes she does them slowly once, then progressively faster but its not enough time to catch on. Will never use this exercise cd again.",1268870400,2,489,4.384615384615385
2247713,4,B0007WQH3U,"I have two left feet and am pretty out of shape and found this DVD to be a good speed my first time through.  The instructor is not overly perky, but keeps you moving. She introduced the steps slowly, but even if I did not get it the first time, I just kept moving my legs and arms.  I broke a little sweat after 40 minutes and stretched on my own at the end.  I'm sure if I try once or twice more, I'll be moving right along with the DVD.  It's on Netflix ""Watch Instantly"" so try it before you buy into the negative reviews.  I thought it was great.",1262736000,2,551,3.9279279279279278
2247714,2,B0007WQH3U,I've come to the conclusion that so called Dance workouts are just walking workouts with some extra footwork. The entire Dance Off the Inches series is geared towards either beginners or overweight people. In no way is this a real workout for the already fit exerciser.,1256860800,,269,4.869565217391305
2247715,3,B0007WQH3U,"The first 2 times I did this video, I thought it moved even a bit slow for me.  And after that, I just didn't feel like it was that great of a workout anymore since she spends way too much time at the slowest tempo and teaching.  I understand you have to slow down and teach initially but after the first viewing, it's so simple that I really didn't even break a sweat anymore.  I do like the teacher - she seems very down to earth and the other dancers were not annoying at all!",1226188800,,479,4.021052631578947
2247716,3,B0007WQH3U,"Dance Off the Inches-Calorie Blasting Party! runs approximately 43 with warmup and cooldown.  There is a ""bonus"" 5 minute dance off, which has some of the moves from the full routine...I like to add it in right before the cooldown for a total workout time of 48 minutes.

Julie Arney instructs...good cueing, but ""Julz"" is overty perky in this one.  Almost to the point where I wished that there was a music only option (and the music is Not good).  Julie is usually perky (I love her in Quick Fix Hip Hop), but in this workout she was way over the top!

I enjoyed the dance segments and thought that the tempo changes were fine and helpful to me in order to learn the dance steps.  I was able to get the whole thing down on the 1st try, except for the last segment which got a little complex near the end.  Almost all of the moves can be done on a carpeted surface, and the 2 or so dance steps that weren't carpet-friendly (the party hop move springs to mind) were easy enough to modify.

The cooldown had No stretching for the legs, which is a big no-no in my book.  I had to add some stretching on my own.

I'd recommend getting DOTI Tummy Tone or Sizzling Salsa over this one, but it's not bad.  Just a little over the top, instructor-wise.",1198281600,2,1244,4.273504273504273
2247717,1,B0007WQH3U,"I was very disappointed in this video. When they say every fitness level, they mean in shape. And when they say gradually step up, they mean they'll show you twice and expect you to know it. Sorry, I'm out of shape and have NO background in dance. While this video may get my blood boiling and sweat pouring, it's only because I have to keep bending over for the remote to rewind to try to get used to the steps. NOT recommended for us fatties...",1170028800,5,446,4.258823529411765
2247718,3,B0007WQH3U,"I thought this might be a fun workout dvd to try based on the reviews here and the concept of dancing as exercise so I rented this workout dvd.

I didn't really enjoy this workout.  I didn't like the music at all, there was nothing about it that made me want to dance or move.  I also didn't like most of the ""dance"" moves.  Some of them were ok, but most of them were not fun.  I was able to catch on to many of them and I'm sure with more practice, I'd be able to do all of them, but I just didn't find most of the moves to be fun.

So, back to the video store this one goes and I don't plan to buy it.",1169251200,4,604,3.6796875
2247719,5,B0007WQH3U,I just ordered it and loved it.  I done aerobics for years and this is a good low impact workout DVD.,1161561600,2,101,3.8095238095238093
2247720,1,B0007WQH3U,I bought this video after having read a review in a magazine about it being a great workout. I work out everyday with videos. I was excited to get this video since I love to dance and figured it would make my working out more enjoyable. NOT TRUE. I did this workout maybe 2 or 3 times before I had enough. For the money I paid I was so disappointed. At this point because I was so unhappy with this video I have shyed away from buying any other dance videos. I did own the NYC Ballet and that is still one of my favorites so I will stick with something like that. I have tried to get into this one a few times and within thr first 10 mins I have lost all my interest. Now it just sits there collecting dust.,1156896000,3,707,3.9510489510489513
2247721,2,B0007WQH3U,"I have been looking for something to help me get started on a regular exercise routine.  So, I checked out this DVD from my local library and I am so glad I didn't buy it first.

I thought this video would be very different from all the rest, but it just reminded me of a slightly updated version of the old Kathy Smith dance video, but at breakneck speed.  I would rather learn dance than jazzercise.  Sorry.

I didn't even finish the first work out.  I recommend you try it before you buy.",1153440000,8,491,4.225806451612903
2247722,3,B0007WQH3U,"What I like about the workout is that it is easy to follow.  The instructor breaks it down slowly first then do the moves up-tempo.  It provides a decent workout for beginners.

On the downside, the workout must be targeted toward an older crowd because the decor/outfits/and routine are just uninspiring. I just could not bring myself to do it again.",1149638400,9,351,4.721311475409836
2247723,3,B0007WQH3U,"Dr. Beth did a great review as always. She is right that this won't keep your heart rate up for those in decent shape & work out at least semi-often. Level 1 is too slow as another said. The production is high & the menu is decent. No ability to change the usual looped bad 70s disco music though.
Juliane Arney is a great teacher, she even cues YOUR right, not hers & the other 4 backup dancers. She breaks down the steps to just lower body first, it's simplified aerobics looking form, then adds to it until you got the lower body steps complete, then she adds the arms & then some extra style. This way of teaching is the best way for those with 2 left feet, but as another said, with this breakdown, you don't need to go pedestrian slow like here, but only 1/2 speed to keep up the heart rate & enthusiasm.
The moves themselves I didn't like, Juliane is a good hip hop dancer, but here there are a lot of old style jazz Broadway moves which are passe. Some ponies, some cute jumps, hops, old go-go & mashed potato... There are about 4 decent dance moves, 2 watered down hip hop moves, but it doesn't save it.

2247724,4,B0007WQH3U,"Calorie Blasting Party is a fun, 42-minute dance workout which is made up of the following segments:  a 4-minute warm up, four choreographed dance sequences (each consisting of about 4-5 individual dance patterns), and a 3-minute cool down.  Instructor Julianne ""Julz"" Arney teaches the dances using a unique, 3-tempo format.  First, she will introduce the steps at the slowest tempo, Tempo 1.  Then, once you have the basic idea, she will speed it up a little to Tempo 2, giving you some additional time to practice.  Finally, you'll perform the dance at full tempo, Tempo 3.

As mentioned above, the dance sequences (about 8 minutes each) consist of 4-5 individual dance patterns which Julz teaches one-by-one.  I have trouble with complex choreography, but I generally found the steps here to be simple, easy-to-learn, and fun as well; there were a few times during the workout that I struggled to follow along, but that didn't seem to matter much as long as I was moving.  I do think that doing the steps at the slowest tempo sometimes made them actually HARDER to replicate; I would have preferred moving more quickly to Tempo 2.  Furthermore, it would have been great to have a Tempo 3 only option on the DVD for once you are already familiar with the workout.

The DVD is well-chaptered, which is nice because you can easily do only a couple of the dances if you're looking for a shorter workout.  In addition, a 5-minute bonus ""Dance Off"" combines some of the moves previously learned, in an all Tempo 3 segment--I liked this but would've liked it even better if it was longer.  The first time I tried this workout, I had trouble keeping my heart rate in my target zone, but the second time (which was following a strength workout), my HR definitely stayed elevated; I expect that it will be even easier to keep my HR up once I become more familiar with the moves.

Overall, I am happy with this workout and believe that I will get a lot of use out of it.",1144713600,16,1963,4.60632183908046
2247725,5,B0007WQH3U,"This is quite a good workout.  It's one that I actually like to do (makes all the difference in whether you choose to exercise or not).  In this workout, it's got a mix of dancy type moves that are easy to follow because Juliane (the instructor) teaches them in a cool format - each pattern is taught to you at three tempos.  It's done first slow, a bit quicker and then at full tempo because by then you'll know the moves.  Then there is a new pattern to learn at the same way and just before you start to get bored she changes the moves to keep it fresh and interesting.  There are the usuall cha-chas and mambo style moves but its still a fresh take on other workouts.  She is a good cuer which really helps you get through the moves and before you know it, you've done the full dvd.  I like this one and try to mix it up with other workouts about 4-5 times a week.
