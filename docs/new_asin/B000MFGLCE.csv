Thank you for perfect services and professional attitude.

I've  been dealing with Amazon on a number of occasions and was never disappointed with the result.

  Wishing you more customers.  I.Conway",1280793600,,368,4.806451612903226

Good video and audio quality. Thoughtful DVD design. No artifacts or pixelation here (unlike some other restored movies).

Highly recommended!",1244332800,,203,6.214285714285714
