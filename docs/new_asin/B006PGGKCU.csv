5012744,1,B006PGGKCU,"I thought because this item cost around $15 that it was a full length DVD.  Even if you get the combo pack with the Puss in Boots DVD, it is $10.  THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH FOR AN 11 MINUTE ""MOVIE"" IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT THAT.  It should clearly state that it is a short story or something on the cover.  I thought the stupid DVD was broke at first when my son came and told me it was already over.",1356652800,,394,3.710843373493976

5012752,2,B006PGGKCU,I did not realize that this was just a mini-movie and special features for the Puss and Boots movie until I actually put it in the DVD player. This movie must have been an extra that came with the Puss n boots movie,1411776000,,215,4.023255813953488

5012757,5,B006PGGKCU,"Folks, my one and only complaint about this delightful movie is simple, they could have done SO MUCH more with it!  Puss is so tenderhearted and so tough (he FEARS NOTHING).  I would like to see MORE Puss in Boots sooner then later!!

5012758,3,B006PGGKCU,"12 minutes of cuteness, but where is the story?  It seems much shorter, feels like 5 minutes.
Where is Kitty Softpaws?  not in this story.
Puss crosses paths with 3 orphan -very bad- kittens, turns them good.  end of story.  Sorry, its hard to say anything about this without giving away the story.

Dont buy new, buy used,  I paid $7 with shipping, that was still too much, I would feel it worth getting for $3 to $5 (-total).  This is a ""short"" that maybe should have been included on the disk with ""Puss In Boots""",1368230400,8,516,4.3125
8502771,1,B006PGGKCU,Five minute movie for $20. Save your money. Not worth the price at all.,1516406400,,71,4.142857142857143

8502779,5,B006PGGKCU,"The only thing wrong with this ""movie"" is that it's only about 15 minutes long, not a movie at all but a ""cartoon.""  It was amusing to see the suave Puss trying to cope with three little kittens. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough of it.  DreamWorks should re-do this and add a real plot and make it into a feature.

We need more Puss in Boots but please don't just stick him into just anything and call it a ""film.""",1427328000,2,416,4.2405063291139244
8502780,5,B006PGGKCU,"Too short, only 15 mins, but there are a lot of features which will appeal to youngsters, including games.  In this one, Puss is hried to recover a stolen ruby, using the three culprits arrested for the crime (the Three Diablos) to help him.  There are some funny moments as he tries to build a rapport with the three kittens and ( like most adults who have no idea how to deal with children) fails miserably.

All in all, it's a fun story, though with less of the usual Puss in Boots innuendos because this is geared toward the younger set. There are a couple of morals and a happy ending thrown in for good measure.
