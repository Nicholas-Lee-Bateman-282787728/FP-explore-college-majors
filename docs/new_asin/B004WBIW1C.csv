I do recommend the prequel Saki more, but this was good and Yukie Nakama gives a great and chilling peformance you won't forget.",1405900800,,272,4.150943396226415
8444845,3,B004WBIW1C,"I have previously bought another Japanese Drama set from this seller before which was good quality, great casing and decent subtitles.  This one is also good quality casing and the DVD is the same quality as what you would buy in a store.  But like other complaints from people that buy from this seller the English subtitles run on Chinese grammar...they don't make sense.  If you speak and understand fluent Japanese this dvd is a steal for the price its being sold....but if you don't speak Japanese its not worth it.",1370649600,,520,4.6923076923076925
8444846,2,B004WBIW1C,"I ordered this drama because I adore KARA and couldn't watch the episodes online. Like many J-dramas, Urakara has a cheesy plot line, but it's cute and entertaining. Even my husband watched it with me!

The only problem is the subtitling. It's HORRENDOUS. Whoever did the English subtitles does not know how to speak English. It's really difficult to understand what's going on because the English is so broken and out of order. That, and Japanese subtitles come on screen frequently in the series (when the robot talks or when the girls speak Korean), and these subtitles were not taken down when the English subtitles were put up. They layer over one another, making either extremely difficult to read.

It's a cute show, but watching it (at least this version?) will require a lot of patience, imagination, and deciphering, unless you understand Japanese!",1330992000,,858,4.993006993006993
