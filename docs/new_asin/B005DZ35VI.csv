4663287,5,B005DZ35VI,"I became a Tebow fan much before I became a football fan.  There was no question about liking the documentary.  If you're ambivalent about him, you'll probably become a fan.  If you're a hater, well, don't you have something better to do?

Its great being able to see the guy behind the media's version of the guy.  What comes through most is his hard work, determination and just sheer niceness - you'd want him as a best friend!  Its also clear how he stays so grounded-being kept accountable by his family and close friends.  The documentary makes no apologies and deals with the tough situations where he's not as successful as well as the happy moments.  Am praying that he is as great in the NFL as he was in college.  We want a Tebow Nation!

His book 'Through my eyes' is a must read too.",1320969600,40,796,4.390410958904109
4663294,5,B005DZ35VI,"My grandson totally enjoys anything from Tim Tebow.  I believe that in a world where druggies and drunken fools are presented as role models, Tebow is a refreshing alternative.",1388793600,,176,5.068965517241379
4663295,2,B005DZ35VI,"Sadly, I found this to be a tedious read.  I had occasion to meet Tim Tebow and he was extremely kind and gracious to all around him, but this autobiography doesn't do him justice.",1386288000,,180,4.294117647058823
4663296,5,B005DZ35VI,"Great documentary. You either like Tebow or you don't. This documentary is not going to make you like him if you don't. If you do like Tebow, you'll respect him even more after this.",1385337600,,182,4.382352941176471
4663297,4,B005DZ35VI,Wish that he would have been able to go somewhere. Long fight but never really succeeds. Good just for learning about Tebow.,1381968000,,124,4.681818181818182
4663298,5,B005DZ35VI,Enough said. Tim Tebow!!!  Everyone needs to order anything by Tim Tebow. Awesome young man of God. Need more men like him.,1368144000,,123,4.590909090909091
4663299,5,B005DZ35VI,"This is a good story about one of the countries best college quarterbacks.
He broke a lot of records.
It is a miracle that he was born.  For health reasons his mother was told to have an abortion.
She refused and carried Tim to term.",1368057600,,233,4.177777777777778
4663300,5,B005DZ35VI,"This book should be an inspiration to anyone.  It is refreshing to see any young person defy the odds and persevere to achieve their goals.  Because of his work ethics and determination, Mr. Tebow will be a success.",1366156800,,215,4.631578947368421
4663301,1,B005DZ35VI,We bought this video for our teenage son who is a huge fan. We wanted to surprise him so we didn't tell him until it arrived. Once he opened it he was excited and couldn't wait to see it so he put it on right away. The DVD was blank! The disappointment in his eyes was enough to make any parent tear up. He still hasn't gotten over it and as for us we will no longer buy anything from Amazon. - Heartbroken Son and Disappointed Parents.,1364083200,,436,4.022988505747127
4663302,5,B005DZ35VI,I remember watching Everything In Between when it first aired on ESPN.  My son and I were hooked.  We watched replays as often as we could find it on ESPN.  Finally broke down and bought the DVD so we could show others.  Great story of the power of a high work ethic.  Tebow credited Chase Heavener with doing a great job telling the story that was there to be told...and I agree.,1358726400,,380,4.222222222222222
4663303,4,B005DZ35VI,I'm a Tim Tebow fan.  I enjoyed the movie and learning more about him.  I would recommend it to any sports fan,1356393600,,110,3.9545454545454546
4663344,5,B005DZ35VI,"Great documentary that gives you an inside look at Tebows home life, which I found to be completely enjoyable to watch, and I have watched it over and over. Must see if you are a Tebow fan.",1354147200,,189,4.135135135135135
4663345,5,B005DZ35VI,"Tim Tebow is awesome!! Loved getting an inside look into his time after college, leading up to the NFL draft. And Loved the special features on the disc. such as Bloopers, Pro-day, a Tim Tebow workout, Draft day, etc. I do hope sometime they do a movie more on his whole life, him in the NFL now, His foundation and the things he supports. But this was an excellent movie, very happy with it. And the movie was shipped fast and arrived perfect. Was very happy with the buy!! No complaints. Besides, you can't wrong with Tebow :) He is an amazing person, on and off the field!",1350950400,,575,4.333333333333333
4663346,5,B005DZ35VI,"If you like Tim Tebow - you'll love this. If you don't like Tim Tebow, you won't. It's as simple as that. It's very well-done, and especially knowing how that first season at Denver went, it makes it that much more exciting to see how hard he worked to get there.",1349049600,,263,4.176470588235294
4663347,3,B005DZ35VI,This was a fascinating look into how the whole Football draft works and into how much work it took Tebow to get ready for the draft and surprisingly how much effort the Broncos went through to get him only to one year later toss him to the wind.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Tebow - and is interested in his journey into the NFL.,1345334400,,344,4.134328358208955
4663348,3,B005DZ35VI,"Great insight to Timmy's training and seeing him out of uniform but the ending sucks bigtime. The film leads up to the 2010 draft which ends at Timmy's parent's house here in Jacksonville. Shows him working out, traveling, talking to the camera and shows him doing charitable work. There are out takes on the everywhereinbetween website that sells this, which shows that what appear to be candid interviews really aren't candid at all. Even though it might appear natural and spontaneous, it is all scripted, just as most films are. Some of those out takes are even better than what was included in the DVD because it's funny to see Timmy mess up and laugh about it.

The ending is very, very, very disappointing because when his name was about to be called as the Broncos draft pick, the film abruptly ends with a black screen before they even announce his name. So, you don't get to see his reaction or anyone else's that was at the house, all who were watching intently. They lead you up to this moment the entire film and get you excited about seeing it, and then they steal the best moment by not showing it to you. I was like, WTF? I felt really cheated and can't believe someone in post production didn't stand up and say, ""Hey, where's the rest of it""? Of all of the films I have ever seen, the ending to this one ranks #1 as the worst ending of all time.",1338422400,,1363,4.408730158730159
4663349,1,B005DZ35VI,Congrats Tebow.  You are the worst quarterback to ever garner this much attention.  It's sickening.  Just wait until the NYC media exposes Tebow's little secret.  I can't wait......,1337817600,,181,5.357142857142857
4663350,5,B005DZ35VI,I enjoyed it.  It started from the time he was searching for an agent to when he got drafted into the NFL.  His workout routine was rigorous and he is definitely someone to be admired.  It's worth the money.,1335139200,,207,4.256410256410256
4663351,3,B005DZ35VI,"The movie concentrates too much on his draft getting into the NFL, and it was not very exciting.  I wish it showed more about his whole life.  A movie needs to be made that is based on his book ""Through My Eyes"".",1332028800,2,212,4.023809523809524
4663352,1,B005DZ35VI,"Bought this hoping for an inspirational video for youth. I have respect for all that Tim has been doing, but this video is a sort of home movie tracking him through hs rigorous training over coming the ney sayers til he finally gets drafted  That's all.",1330819200,,253,4.5
4663353,5,B005DZ35VI,"Extremely happy with my purchase, I also purchased ""Through My Eyes"", which was also a joy to read, and intend on purchasing kiddie edition (book) for my niece. Nice production of Tim Tebow's journey into the NFL. Can not get enough of Tim Tebow!!!",1329436800,,248,4.659090909090909
4663354,5,B005DZ35VI,"I pre-ordered this video here before it came out. I am extremely pleased with the quality of the production, the story line, everything. Tebow truly shows how much he went through and how incredibly resilient and how hard he trained to make it into the league. This is a great inspirational story that can motivate anybody to work hard in the face of people telling them that they can't do something. Really motivational and well done.",1329350400,2,435,4.7368421052631575
4663355,5,B005DZ35VI,"This is a great insight of Tim Tebow's life starting with his last college football game and leading up to the NFL draft picks.  Everything in between is literally what takes place between those two events.  You really get a feel for Tim's nature and his devotion to all things important in his life.  He is such a focused athlete, yet his fun side shines through as well. This would not only be a great DVD of inspiration for young athletes with big dreams, but also just an example of what a positive role model looks like.",1329350400,,525,4.391752577319588
4663356,4,B005DZ35VI,"This movie is great for anyone who is a Tebow fan. Although I highly recommend this movie, they should have waited until the end of the 2011 season to show some awesome highlights from his professional career. That being said, that was one of the few things lacking from this movie, along with his awe-inspiring high school football career that can be seen in full from his ESPN documentary on youtube. Overall I recommend, and am looking forward to seeing his 2012 debut as the Broncos official starter.",1328140800,,504,4.738636363636363
4663357,5,B005DZ35VI,"This is not a rah-rah documentary filled with sports cliches.  I do love football, but appreciate books, film and TV programs to give me more than just information. I very much appreciate the way stories are told, and prefer fiction to non-fiction.  I'm a huge fan of Friday Night Lights because of the way the story is told, the characters become real and I find the context says as much as the dialog.  Just because this is about a real person doesn't mean that the storytellers had less to work with.

Of course anyone contemplating buying this is already a fan of Tim Tebow, but that is not to say that the content shies away from the warts of controversy. After all, it is a big part of his story. It is a balanced film, with engaging camera angles that draw you into the conversations, and a good score that helps this feel more like a fictional story.

The added footage and the extras section makes this well worth the DVD, so even if you've seen this on TV, it's still worth it.  I just can't wait for the sequel!",1327363200,2,1022,4.352631578947369
4663358,5,B005DZ35VI,Must tell you how much I enjoy this dvd.  Have gotten one for my grandson at Christmas.  It is a testament to hard work and being focused.,1327363200,,138,4.074074074074074
4663359,5,B005DZ35VI,"Whenever I was feeling down after Tebow had a game that he struggled in this last NFL season, I would re-watch this, and I would be reminded why I always have to pull for this guy. He just never gives up. He is going to do everything he can to succeed. You can't help but root for this guy, and the best thing that can be said about this DVD is that it very well encapsulates what makes Tebow such a remarkable athlete and person.",1327104000,,430,4.070588235294117
4663360,5,B005DZ35VI,"This DVD is a great addition to my collection.  I am hoping to pass it onto my son's football coach for the simple reason of exposing kids to the realities of moving to the next level.  In this DVD you will not find a big plug to endorse Tim's spiritual side, although they touch on his faith very briefly.  It is subtle enough that any public high school coach could show it to his players with confidence.  The biggest benefit of viewing this DVD is simple.  Many kids think that it they have talent, and they are assured to move to the next level.  With raw talent, they may win the lottery of sorts and be discovered or get a scholarship - but it is NOT the norm.  There is NO replacement for hard work and dedication, and Tim's gift is not underscored at all by his incredible determination to use every moment to improve and excel.  Kids need to see what time and effort Tim and his family have put into his success.  Don't be a hater until you actually see how hard this Tim Tebow works.  I believe this DVD shows a glimpse of what it takes to be the best that you can be - and you might be surprised.  I'm a fan for sure now!",1327104000,,1133,4.127853881278539
4663361,5,B005DZ35VI,I really appreciated the view on the inside of preparing for the draft. Tim is an awesome and driven man who Loves the Lord. This is a great teaching video to anyone overcoming trials.,1326758400,,184,4.4411764705882355
4663362,1,B005DZ35VI,Any movie about this no talent hack is sure to blow.  After his horrible performance against the pats I am glad we can finally stop hearing about this clown.,1326672000,,157,4.413793103448276
4663363,5,B005DZ35VI,Excellent production. This DVD is well worth watching and loaning out to friends and family. Great price here on Amazon. Four bucks cheaper than you'll find anywhere else.,1326585600,,171,5.142857142857143
4663364,5,B005DZ35VI,Given as a Christmas gift to my 15 year old! He really enjoyed it! Interesting history & revealing to how he made it to where Tebow is now. Great buy :),1325116800,2,152,3.935483870967742
4663365,5,B005DZ35VI,"This was a great Video! I purchased 1 for myself and 1 as a gift for someone. It was wonderful to watch about how Tim transitioned into college football and prepared for the NFL. Regardless of how you feel about his football skills, you have to admit, watching shows that he practices what he preaches. Hard Work and determination!",1325030400,2,331,4.627118644067797
4663366,5,B005DZ35VI,Got this for my Tebow-loving friend for Christmas and he loves it! Just shy of 60 min in length and it has some cool special features like the Tebow work-out.,1324425600,4,158,4.3
4663367,5,B005DZ35VI,"It's Tim Tebow, it's awsome of course.  He is absolutely unbelievable.  If you need some motivation just watch Timmy, a great Gator.",1323302400,6,132,4.954545454545454
4663368,5,B005DZ35VI,"A must for every Tim Tebow fan.  A poignant story of an amazing young man that truly believes he is not the best, but pushes himself to be the best he can be.  A great model for today's youth.",1323216000,12,192,3.8974358974358974
4663369,5,B005DZ35VI,"This video ""Tim Tebow: Everything In Between"" will have you cheering! It's awe inspiring and positive. It covers the moments from the end of the 2010 Sugar Bowl victory, to the 2010 Senior Bowl, and through the Pre-NFL Draft workouts and NFL Combine.  The video comes to a close as the excitement builds on Draft Day and how Tim overcomes the negativity to become a 1st round draft pick. This is an well documented video which shows the many aspects of Tim Tebow from his personal workouts, his relationships with his family, his fans and professionals in the business. Its quite surprising if you don't know much about Tebow, as his character and determination shows quite well with all the things he is involved with. I highly recommend this 50 minute video to any Tim Tebow fan as his story is in itself is great.",1323216000,5,816,4.627586206896551
4663370,5,B005DZ35VI,I really enjoy this video. I admire Timmy for what he stands for and not backing down because he is in the public eye and Praising God and Thanking God publicly is not 'politically correct'. He's not letting the world get to him. He has a great ministry and truly has a heart for missions. I would recommend everyone to watch it. I was a little disappointed though I must say. I had seen the ESPN special so I was hoping this actual DVD would have more in the main part but the outtakes and bloopers were a GREAT added bonus!,1322697600,9,525,4.207920792079208
4663371,5,B005DZ35VI,"The things this man does to win are amazing. I started trying to do what he does daily, though I don't come close, I am a better man for it. Thank you Mr. Tebow.",1322352000,13,161,3.764705882352941
4663372,5,B005DZ35VI,"Tim Tebow's story is one that inspires all ages. This DVD captures his amazing story and will encourage you to follow your dreams and appreciate events in your life as the lessons and blessing that they really are. You'll see through Tim's eyes that the path ahead of us is filled with possibilities; that you are not alone.
Thanks Tim Tebow for your great character and shining example of what a person can be when they believe!",1321488000,27,429,4.584415584415584
4663373,5,B005DZ35VI,"There's a reason why Tim Tebow is the most discussed football player in the NFL: his combination of superb athletic skill and exemplary character seem too good to be true.

They are both true.

Human beings everywhere are looking for people who can be role models for their children and themselves. People who never give up. People who put others above themselves. People who have integrity. People who have devout faith, and who are able to express it in a sincere and inoffensive way. People who live not for themselves, but for a greater good that shines like a beacon on their path.

Well, Tim Tebow is your guy. This documentary shows not only what it takes to get drafted into the NFL, but what it takes to succeed in life. It shows you the human failings and the setbacks that get in the way of achieving a goal. It casts adversity as a motivating force. It paints humility as a backdrop to the roller coaster of life.

So the reason Tim Tebow and this documentary are so fascinating is that we all want to be at least a little more like Tim Tebow. Even those of us who have dedicated our lives to disenfranchised people have something to learn about how better to inspire others to do the same.

And we can all aspire to his serenity -- a serenity that comes from a remarkably well-formed identity and a sure purpose.

I personally don't share many aspects of his religion but I love Tim Tebow. I love the fact that he is saving orphans with his NFL salary, and that he has a servant's heart for disenfranchised children. I love the fact that he is true to himself and his faith.

And, of course, he is a great football player. There is plenty of football in this documentary, along with a behind-the-scenes view of the NFL draft process.

But that's not the reason to watch it. It's a study in a life well lived. A young person with an impressively mature, grounded soul.

Go Tebow! And, God bless you as you bless others!",1321142400,76,1931,4.432203389830509
