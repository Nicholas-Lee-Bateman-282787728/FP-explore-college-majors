8160018,3,B000L42O22,"This video is not really that in depth or scientififc.  When I got this I was expecting more of a diet plan, but what it really was was just a documentary of someones trip to Japan (with all the unhealthy foods they ate there).  of course I cant substantiate this with facts, but this whole video really seems like some proffesors sabatical project, which of course just boiled down into a vacation.  all in all it was still worth the cheap price of admission, and was fairly entertaining to watch.",1336953600,,498,4.511111111111111
8160019,5,B000L42O22,"The videos ""Japan: Samurai, Geisha and Technology"" and the ""Diet of Japan"" are the perfect tourist guides and introduction to Japan's cuisine for my customers.  I run a small family Japanese restaurant in northern England and we show these videos to my customers (we got permission to show these from the producer). Unlike many parts of the UK, we live in a town which is still new to the idea of eating Sushi or any food which does not come from Europe for that matter.  These videos are a great way to get our customers to try some sushi and to spend more time in my restaurant.",1211068800,6,580,4.411214953271028

8160021,5,B000L42O22,"I really loved this video. It's refreshing to see a new way to lose weight that really works. And this isn't just about Japanese food it's about how to live a healthy lifestyle, which you can adapt to the food you eat in the USA. `Most diet fads don't work.' On the other hand, during the last century, 100 million people tested the diet shown on this video and they succeeded - it shows how the Japanese stay healthy and thin. And they have fewer cancer, heart disease and menopause problems than Americans. The DIET of JAPAN shows 12 types of Japanese cuisine (sushi is only one of these, if eating raw fish is not your cup of tea), and it shows how the Japanese exercise and relax. The music is great, and it even has music videos to help you lose weight. It reveals the seven secrets of how the Japanese keep off the pounds and live the longest on earth. And you can follow most of these tips even if you only want to eat American food.",1170892800,14,940,4.256983240223463
