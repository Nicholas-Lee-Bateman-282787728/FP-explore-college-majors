5058974,5,B007719IY4,"I initially hesitated to buy this course, I thought that ""The Everyday Guide to Wine"" might not delve deeply enough into the world of wine for my interest. But I was wrong! This course lays out in considerable detail all the elements and varieties of wine. It's packed with details, amazing photography, regional maps, and myriad examples of how to describe the appearance, aromas, and tastes of wine. Jennifer Simonetti-Bryan, who clearly knows her wine, will guide you on a fascinating journey. I highly recommend this series and look forward to more by The Great Courses.",1419811200,3,574,4.989583333333333
5058975,5,B007719IY4,Fabulous course for anyone who wants to learn about wine. Jennifer has incredible knowledge and it has really opened up a new world for me.,1373068800,,139,4.6
5058976,5,B007719IY4,"I'm having a great time with this series produced by The Great Courses and taught by the talented Jennifer Simonetti-Bryan. Wines and their multitudes of variations are the topic, and though I live in the hinterlands of Wyoming I've had no problem finding examples of wines covered (so far). It's fun learning, relaxing, and enjoying new wines on these long Winter evenings.",1455235200,,374,5.048387096774194
5058977,4,B007719IY4,I found this informative and entertaining....,1454630400,,45,6.666666666666667
5058978,4,B007719IY4,Great details! Better than done videos out there but the first episode is not as good. I'm not done watching the entire series so will see ifbitveill good till the end .,1446422400,,169,4.3125
5058979,5,B007719IY4,Very informative with good detail and presented well. I'm looking forward to viewing more episodes.,1445731200,,99,5.666666666666667
5058980,1,B007719IY4,Boring.  She's like a robot.,1443830400,,28,4.6
5058981,4,B007719IY4,"The Great courses are very good places to go if you want to get really well thought out information about subjects.  This guide to wine is no different, would recommend it",1435795200,,171,4.516129032258065
5058982,5,B007719IY4,"Absolutely loved it.  Jennifer Simonetti-Bryan is great to watch, she was interesting, easy to follow and informative.  I havn't jumped in to buy the whole series yet, but I am sure in time I will get the whole series.  Definitely worth watching.",1432944000,,246,4.809523809523809
5058983,5,B007719IY4,"Jennifer uses a very logical, rational, organized approach to make a complex subject matter understandable and approachable. It requires exceptional subject matter expertise and an especially orderly mind to be able to do such an effective job of teaching this course.
This is well worth the investment of time and money!",1426032000,3,321,5.313725490196078
5058984,5,B007719IY4,"I wasn't nuts about the first episode (far too much time is spent on Simonetti's background), but once this series got going, it was just a wealth of information, presented in a very engaging way. I recommend getting your friends together for a weekly tasting. Each couple can buy one of the wines being discussed, and then you can watch each episode together as a group while tasting along with the instructor.",1425945600,5,411,4.722222222222222
5058985,3,B007719IY4,I watched this to get an insight to Australian wines.  I was a bit underwhelmed with the knowledge that was put forth.  The audio was difficult for me to understand.  The voice of the presenter was fuzzy sounding.,1424390400,,213,4.552631578947368
8511447,5,B007719IY4,Great Teachers are the real thing. Anyone feeling a need to understand wine this is about as good as it gets. So pleased with this purchase.,1526169600,,140,4.423076923076923
8511448,4,B007719IY4,"Ms. Simonetti-Bryan did a wonderful job of balancing often complex information with charming and entertaining anecdotes. I am also amazed at how much I learned from this series -- enough to impress even wine snobs!

My only complaint is with the first episode, when Ms. Simonetti-Bryan seemed to be doing an extended promotion of herself. I came to understand why she really needed to do this (to establish her bona fides), but it seemed a bit self aggrandizing. I'm not sure how else this could have been done succinctly. Otherwise, a first rate effort.",1522368000,,554,4.8936170212765955
8511449,5,B007719IY4,"I skipped the first episode and went straight to what I wanted to learn: episode 10, different wine tastes/grapes.  The videos excelled in this regard.  I am happy to pay $2.99 an episode to have something I can watch and re-watch.  There is so much information, its hard to absorb it all in one setting.  I am a total wine novice.  But now I know what to look for in selecting a good wine.

She walks through the different grape varieties, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, etc, and recommends you 6 different wines to taste all the variety. I didn't buy all 6 like she recommends.  But I buy one at a time, and watch the video.  When I finish the bottle, I buy another bottle and watch parts of the video again.  It doesn't allow me to compare wines at the same time but its more practical for me.

After spending $50 on a wine course in which I felt like everything went over my head, I much prefer this style of learning.  I also bought and started reading the Wine Bible, but its more interesting and achievable for me to watch a 30 min video.  I

I'm finding that a high quality wine bottle costing me $30 at the store are often sold for $100 in restaurants.  Wines that are $12 dollars a glass (or $18 once I factor in tax and tip), are from $14 dollar bottles.  I much rather enjoy high quality wine at home then spend so much more at a restaurant.",1511654400,,1362,4.245136186770428
8511450,3,B007719IY4,"The information was good.. I didn't care for Jennifer, she's not a very good speaker.. There was a lot of time spent on telling what wines to buy for the tasting but I felt like very little time was spent on actually tasting and comparing.",1501804800,,239,4.333333333333333
8511451,5,B007719IY4,Jennifer Simonetti-Bryan is an outstanding teacher!  I have learned so much in a very enjoyable way from watching this course.  I would highly recommend this Great Course to anyone who really wants to know and understand wine.,1496707200,,226,5.081081081081081
8511452,5,B007719IY4,"Lots of information , didn't do tasting but inintrsting facts  on where different wines come from.",1486598400,,98,5.125
8511453,3,B007719IY4,"The information in this video is good - but it's really painful to watch. I don't like the presenter (voice, tone, character, expressions).
The entire first episode is presenter telling everyone how hard it (the test) is to become a Wine Master - it's an hour of self-promotion. The next couple of episodes are much better (I haven't finished watching the entire series yet). I would not want to watch this again - but I will finish watching the series.",1483747200,,453,4.675
8511454,5,B007719IY4,A good read.,1482019200,,12,3.3333333333333335
8511455,4,B007719IY4,$2.99 an episode is a bit ridiculous. Decent intro information and fair depth and descriptions. Worth a watch if you don't mind paying $3 for an episode.,1470787200,,153,4.703703703703703
8511456,5,B007719IY4,"This lady reeeeally knows here wine! Very informative, and presentation is very professional. Highly recommend!",1466035200,,111,6.466666666666667
