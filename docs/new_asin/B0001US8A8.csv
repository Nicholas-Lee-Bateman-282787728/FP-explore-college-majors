2024537,5,B0001US8A8,I'm all about 'cleo'. This movie looks great with epic scenic color washes in great locations that more than make up for the obvious lack of budget.. the only faltering point is the alien looks a little like a paper mache puppet by numbers... However; 'cleo' - the leading lady scientist makes lara croft look 'all about eve'... cleo is played by beautiful new bad girl in hollywood 'phobe falconer' who in this reviewers humble opinion is the future saving grace of action eye candy & definitely the only reason i give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.. I am enamoured.. What else is she in; what other cult 'B' movies can she save & where can i buy the figurine...?,1092009600,,662,4.434426229508197
2024538,5,B0001US8A8,"Where can you even begin with a movie like this? Well I guess with Heidi Fleis since she's the reason this flick gets any attention at all. Believe me, she looks good. She wears a purple Elvira type dress most of the time and she's got a great bod. Yeah, she's hot. But she's not the main babe of the film, oh no, that goes to Cleo.

Cleo is the amazing blonde who despite what she goes through in the film she does not sweat or get dirty! She is an extremely pale Traci Lords look-alike to boot. She runs around in 110 degree desert heat, she crawls through dirty caves, crashes through underground rock formations, and wrestles with aliens, but her hair is always perfect, her makeup is always fresh, and there's never a speck of dirt or sand on her. Amazing. You see she is a scientist who made a monster for the military to be a 'biological killing machine'. But it has escaped and she has to stop it. To help her is the bumbling town sheriff. Who despite being shot point blank in the chest, can come back with a clean shirt five minutes later and kick your butt, only to be shot again in the head.

What else can we possibly get? How about an obvious fake alien fetus, a large breasted woman with no arms that can throw knives with her mouth (and grow arms at the sight of danger), two Siamese twins joined at the arm with a ribbon, and a dumb blonde who wants to call AAA on a cellphone for a flat tire in the middle of freakin' NOWHERE.

8016362,5,B0001US8A8,"Yes, this is probably the worst movie of all time...just about everything is wrong with it: Directing, acting, ""special effects,"" and more. It fails as a movie in every way possible. But it's possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen, buy this and watch it, but don't expect anything, it's no fun unless you make fun of it.",1167696000,,324,4.603448275862069
8016363,1,B0001US8A8,"Obviously, the producers of this movie could not get a ""real"" star, so they decided to hire a ""celebrity"" who has long outlived her 15 minutes of fame to draw attention to this flick instead. Enter ex prostitution ringleader Heidi Fleiss. Her role in this film is (fortunately) very limited. To put it nicely, she simply can't act. She looks like she is about a hundred years old and spaced out on who knows what kinds of drugs. The film even features her ""shooting up"" with some kind of mystery drug, and her circus-freak assistant smoking crack while on a break.

The leading actress in this movie is decent looking, but nothing to get excited about. I'm guessing that it took a truckload of hydrogen peroxide in order to keep her hair that color throughout the movie, not to mention a truckload of bright red lipstick. She can barely act, as is true of most of the cast.

The bad acting, cheezy special effects and lousy editing are bad enough, but its the script that doomed this film from the very beginning. At best, the plot simply makes no sense. Supposedly, the government's most top-secret, lethal biological killing machine has just escaped from Area 51. So, who do they send to take care of the problem? A 100 lb blond bimbo with a Rambo knife. Yeah, sure. I wish I could say that the plot was confusing, but that's not the case. It's just plain stupid and unbelievable.

I have to concur with the other reviewer here that the person writing this screenplay may very well have been under the influence of some mind-altering chemical. I suspect that may have been the case with a lot of the people connected to this movie. Exactly why you would throw-in someone smoking crack in the middle of the film for no apparent reason, describing how great it felt, pretty much speaks for itself. You pretty much would have to be using crack in order to think that this movie was any good.

If making bad movies was a crime, the makers of this film deserve a life sentence. ""Just say NO"" to Alien 51.",1123632000,,2001,4.519337016574585
8016364,1,B0001US8A8,"First, if you are going to name a film Alien 51, you need to place some emphasis on the creature.  Apparently, it was a recycled creature from another film (see the movie El Chupacabra, a film I haven't seen, but have added it to my list) and nothing created from any sort of imagination or originality.  That already says a lot about where the quality of this picture is going to come from.  If their main character is actually a creature from another film, our filmmakers have already cheated us from any sort of value. Recycling creatures in a non-mocumentary sort of way is an insult and immediately my DVD player should have dispensed the total amount spent on this rental.  As if it isn't bad enough that the creature is from another film, it also has as much screen time as Dame Judi Dench did in Shakespeare in Love, actually probably less.  Where is the alien during most of this film?  I honestly thought that his agent was probably suggesting that he not participate in this production because it could ultimately hurt his career as an extra terrestrial.  ""Don't expect to hear from Spielberg if you continue with Alien 51."" I could hear his agent saying.  Nonetheless, he does make a small ""cameo"" role near the end where tempers flair, emotions rise, and the excitement of the final credits are finally in sight.

Second, if you are making a movie and you cannot get anyone to headline, then I would reconsider using Heidi Fleiss.  Now, I am not an actor at all, but I have seen several independent films, and I can say this.  She cannot act at all.  In fact, there were some special features on this DVD which allowed you to see the director giving instructions to the actors, and I just couldn't help but think that Fleiss' comments were going in one ear and out the other.  I am surprised to witness that the director just didn't go ""postal"" on everyone when they chose to do their own form of acting instead of following the directions presented to them.  Perhaps, and this may throw my image of this film completely off, but just maybe that was the director's style of filmmaking.  I have never witnessed a director who wanted to be cheap, allow his cast to walk in and out of scenes, and demonstrate that an entire community of women must have had some form of breast implants, but maybe that is what our dual directors, Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne (yep, it took two to butcher these cinematic moments), wanted to ultimately create.  If that is the case, then they have done a wonderful job and should be congratulated for their slackish behavior and performances.  I would love to know what their budget was on this film because honestly, you could have paid me nothing and I would have found better material.  Ok, you have a character named Doctor PsychoBilly.  It really cannot get much worse than that.

Finally (while there are many, many, many more, I will stop here), whomever wrote this script I do believe was heavily under the influence of some banned substance, or possibly watched too much Anchorman and decided to act like Brick while writing.  Either way, the lines in this film were the most enjoyable to listen to because they were possibly the worst ever written by another human being.  I am not afraid to go on the record with that statement.  My favorite line in the entire film was when Cleo and the police officer were walking around at night (yet, it was so bright outside from the apparent spotlights) and she throws him on the ground, takes her top off and attempts to show him her scar from an earlier alien encounter.  His response to her being on top of him and taking her top off was, ""I am supposed to be looking at your scar right"".  HA.  You could hear it in his voice that he was already too excited to have a woman on top of him topless.  It literally had me in stitches on the ground.  Thank you for writing comedy, this film needed it!

Grade: * out of *****",1115251200,6,3914,4.504249291784703
8016365,1,B0001US8A8,"(...)

This was a painful flick to watch. The acting makes you wince like fingernails over the top of your car. Heidi Fleiss was atrocious to the point of being criminal, the dialog was trifling and unorganized, and the ""alien"" was the same horrible cheesy crap-fest of a special effects career-breaker that was featured in ""El Chupacabra."" If it's not the same monster, it's his twin brother. Jeez.

If anything could have saved this attempt, it would have been the (only sometimes decent) photography. But that was its strongest component. (...)  I was very disappointed by its performance.

It's a ""B"" movie and rates a 2.5/10 on the ""B"" scale.

That's about a 0.8/10 on the ""A"" scale, which doesn't even register on Amazon.com's 1-5 star scale, but since I must at least give it one star, I do so grudgingly.
