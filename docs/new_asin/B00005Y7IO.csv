7956660,5,B00005Y7IO,"Perhaps I speak prematurely having only viewed two season DVD's, but this episode has the tone I was looking for.  It is quiet.  Music accompanies, rather than blasts through the episode, as it does on the others I have viewed.  The camera work is perfect.  I get the images of Paris that I most enjoy.  The story itself is intriguing, and Gambon's Maigret is lovely. There are no grotesque images.  The other episodes viewed seem made more for the crash bang louder louder heavier murk-loving crowd.",1301529600,,500,4.755813953488372
