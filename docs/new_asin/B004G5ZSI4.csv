And now again, he reached me so deeply and so emotionally by playing Szymanovsky's Sonata collaborated together with Irmina Trynkos in a way that allowed me to feel that I was hearing it for the very first time. His technique is brilliant at the very least, but his interpretation of the classics, is for me, beyond measure. In addition, the utter joy of these remarkable artists and passion for the  violin & piano allows them to bring a fresh and extraordinarily contemporary experience to his audience!",1294185600,,669,4.868421052631579
8731979,5,B004G5ZSI4,"The combination of these two great artists continually results in some of the finest music making ever. The two seem to almost share a mind while performing so perfectly in tune with each other they come across.  This is music-making of the highest order - the freedom and unanimity of interpretation you hear when two great musicians who love to play together take their time to work on details of tempo changes and phrasing. The performance is elegant, unhurried, expressive and impressive!  These pieces for violin and piano make for a beautiful expression of a musical dialogue in the great Romantic fashion. This is a recording to be enjoyed and studied by all!",1293321600,,666,4.884955752212389
