7926446,1,B00004Y2QB,"I bought this movie on my kindle. I thought it would be funny. I am ok with some swearing, but they started dropping f-bombs and I gave up on it. I would have given it zero stars but we do not have that system.
Amazon refunded the price I paid for it. Thank you Amazon.",1475280000,,269,3.909090909090909

7926448,4,B00004Y2QB,"If you watch this movie and don't laugh out loud several times, check your pulse.  This movie has some incredible jokes that I won't spoil for you.  But it's basically one after another.  Some of the references are a bit dated, but if you're in your 40's upward, you'll get it.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I only give 5 stars if a movie is so good it makes me poop myself.",1395014400,,394,4.077922077922078
7926449,5,B00004Y2QB,"Most of all, I enjoyed the constant barrage of jokes that Blobermouth expounded.  Steve McQueen has always be one of my favorite actors.  All in all a most enjoyable movie, much more so than the original movie, the Blob!",1365033600,,220,4.615384615384615
7926450,5,B00004Y2QB,"I'm not sure who came up with the idea to take this film which, I'll admit, terrified me as a child, and dub over it. But, they are a genius! This movie cracks me up no matter how many times I watch it, and I can't even watch the original, anymore, without laughing. A super unique, kinda weird and random film, but definitely one of out-of-this-world hilarity!!",1364515200,,362,4.417910447761194
7926451,5,B00004Y2QB,"Blobermouth ranks up there with the Airplane movies for being fun and funny.  At times the language is not what you want your kids repeating but it is not anything they have not heard someplace else. What they have done for to this classic B movie is like what MST3K did for years, bring new life to an old friend.",1360713600,,314,4.233333333333333
7926452,4,B00004Y2QB,Always liked MAD Movies and the TV Show... This is a good example of their work. Great Drunk Party Movie,1358985600,,104,4.25
7926453,4,B00004Y2QB,"For Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans-
Take a cheezy B movie, ad some snappy silly dialogue and for this movie, also throw in some funny sound effects. Mix and serve.
Good for a laugh and worth seeing for the ""Lloyd Bridges"" as Elmer Fudd scenes alone!",1262304000,2,252,4.5
7926454,4,B00004Y2QB,"this is a goofy little film taht is actually well written. The original Blob was kind of dull to begin with, but this group was actually pretty brilliant in rewriting the vocal track to turn the story into a different one with the same movie. Some of the voice overs are hilarious, especially the Aunt Bea part and the girl who plays McQueen's girfriend is a hoot through out. This is along the Mystery Science Theater vien or Kung Pow",1125187200,4,435,4.45
