Im not buying any more Tiger Claw dvds ever again. It just shows you the 'roads' for a short time and it dosent have detail. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product. You will probably be disappointed like me.",1394409600,,368,4.590909090909091
8346812,2,B001VYX934,"grand master zhang is an amazing martial artist but this video is terrible. it teaches 10 spring leg only and cuts off offense after 3. there is not 50 minutes worth of learing techniques on this mayhaps about...25-30 mintues. it was very cheaply done, it didn't do her any justice. i would not recommend this to anyone...unless it was under $5.",1203033600,4,345,4.672131147540983
