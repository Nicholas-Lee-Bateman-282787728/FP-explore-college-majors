8539622,5,B009CI8RYW,"I always loved this movie ever since I saw it in the 1970's and I collect anything Mia Farrow starred in.  This movie has a great cast of actors that many would recognize.  The story is quirky because Mia's character, Brooke, is quirky and very immature.  Hal Holbrook is great as the neighbor she pesters all the time and Martin Sheen the agent who seems more of a father figure who tolerates Brooke's frequent tantrums.

I had to grab this as soon as I discovered it since these made for TV movies are rarely released. I'm glad it was.",1512345600,,537,4.393939393939394
8539623,4,B009CI8RYW,"I saw this movie for the first time on the Friday Movie of the Week in 1971!  When I found out it was on DVD I ordered it as fast as I could.  For those of you who went through the70's this film is a treasure trove of the era.  The clothing, hair and language are so early 70's it brings on a smile every time I see it.  Hal Holbrook is at his cynical, unflappable best as the freelance writer who's befriended a young, out of work actress played by Mia Farrow.  While watching Farrow, who is sad, angry, temperamental, manipulating and waiflike all at once, it struck me that back then, there was no help for individuals with bipolar disorder.  Farrow is fun to watch in any case although you will probably want to strangle her at times.  Holbrook has always been one of  my favorite actors and I think this may  have been the first time I had seen what he really looked like without the Mark Twain make-up, what a gorgeous man!  And he is the one person who won't buy into Farrow's behavior even though she does her level best to twist Hal around her finger.  Look for a very young Martin Sheen as Mia Farrow's agent.",1390176000,,1119,4.231132075471698
