7874053,3,6304539460,"This series is alright but, it gets kinda boring at this point. The worse part is that the English dubbing is horrible, the Americans don't know how to dubbed good japanese anime. I not Japanese to let you know. but Ken totally sounds like a beach retarded fool, Ryu doesn't sound aggressive enough, Vega is just totally off the royal rocker(in a bad tone). Whatever you do, get the original japanese version.",982368000,,409,4.694444444444445
