8408045,5,B003XF1W3I,"This is an interesting product that teaches Mathematics using an animated story.
The animation is good, and doesn't distract from the Mathematics.
The DVD covers concepts in Basic Mathematics, suitable for children who are just starting school, up to about 3rd grade or so.  Concepts are presented in a visual manner, which makes this better than a book.
The characters learn their stuff by playing games, which makes it more appealing to children.  My niece loved it - and wants to see it again and again.
All in all, an interesting and different product!",1287705600,,556,4.904255319148936
