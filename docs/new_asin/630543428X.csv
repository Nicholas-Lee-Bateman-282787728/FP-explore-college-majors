8300168,5,630543428X,"This outstanding series of VHS tapes is now available on DVD.  If you purchased it from Tsunami, you can get the 5 DVDs for $20 each. The 5 DVDs contain all 15 VHS tapes.  Each DVD has an introduction that is different and worth the $20, e.g., photos of a young Funakoshi Sensei and his teachers, photos of Takushoku University karate and how JKA began, video of Nakayama Sensei doing Tekki Shodan, Nishiyama Sensei showing blocks, Kanazawa Sensei doing kata, JKA tournament bouts, etc.",1163116800,,486,4.773809523809524
8300169,5,630543428X,"Most people will buy this video because it features all the top JKA Shotokan instructors like Nakayama, Osaka, Tanaka, Yahara, etc. but the real value of this video, and the series it is part of, is the thought that  has gone into the content and its quality of delivery. Clearly a great deal  of money was spent on the production which features location shoots at  temples and places of natural beauty. The techniques are shown in  excrutiating detail and the voice over (in English) supports the action  well. Is is high level, so it might go over the heads of some, but it is  after all the definitive work on the subject by the top people in the  style. Duplication of this series takes place in the U.S. and is of high  order. Quality problems referred to have all be traced to pirated copies.  If you buy from a legitimate source you will be delighted both with the  quality and content",953596800,4,892,4.484472049689441
8300170,5,630543428X,"For anyone seriously interested in Japanese Shotokan Karate this series is a must.  The kata are superbly demonstrated, with explanations and applications clear and unequivocal.  Osaka Sensei, who performs the kata  has won the All-Japan and World Championships more times than any other  karate-ka.  From the video, it's easy to see why.  As an invaluable source  of reference, this should be a part of every Martial Artist's library.  There is now no longer any excuse for misunderstandings or variations in  kata, brought about by misinterpretation.  The wealth of knowledge and  expertise of Japan's finest, is now available for everyone.",926640000,14,642,5.383838383838384
