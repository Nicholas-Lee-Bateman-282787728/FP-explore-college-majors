5113819,4,B007WXV0W0,"By the title I was expecting this DVD to have Thomas episodes featuring basic skills like counting, colors and shapes, but that is not what I discovered. Schoolhouse Delivery gets it's name from the first episode where in fact there is a delivery to the school house. However there is still plenty of back-to-school fun to be had in character building if not arithmetic basics. I agree that there are timeless lessons that can never be taught too much in learning friendship, cooperation, obedience and structure. It is important to be yourself, but also part of the team. Thomas & Friends is always fun and we are becoming fast fans in our family.

*Thanks to the publicist for providing a copy for review.*",1349395200,3,708,4.7560975609756095
5113820,5,B007WXV0W0,"This is another fun Thomas DVD.  It has four episodes on it from the fourteenth and fifteenth seasons.  The episodes are the same from television but its nice to watch one anytime or watch them all in a row!  My boys (4 and 5 years old) love Thomas and with school coming up we are working on manners and working together.  Thomas and Friends are great examples for kids as the show teaches lessons like its okay to make mistakes, don't be jealous of your friends, work together, be yourself, be safe and more.  The episodes are full of fun trains, bright animation, and music!",1344297600,10,577,4.457142857142857

5113826,5,B007WXV0W0,"If your kids love Thomas and his friends from the island of Sodor as much as my grandson, these being on the Prime streaming make it more than worth the yearly cost.
There are a few episodes...not necessarily around a common theme or anything...with some live-action scenes in between.

Highly recommended.",1390176000,,306,5.0

8522776,4,B007WXV0W0,"My nearly-two year old son loves the Thomas episode collections.

This DVD includes:
Diesel's Special Delivery- Diesel is tasked with delivering slates to the schoolhouse so that the roof can be repaired for the children. But he sees the children clapping for James when he delivers ""pretty pink piglets"" and desperately wants them to clap and cheer for him. So he shunts several different flatbeds around the island, with no claps or cheers. Then he realizes, the children MOST want slates for the school roof so they can be warm and dry inside the schoolhouse. When he delivers the slates, he finally hears claps and cheers from the children.

Being Percy- Percy is trying to deliver the mail on time, but all of his friends are blocking his path and don't seem to be paying attention when he asks to get through. Percy observes Gordon's big personality demanding passage and decides he'll be just like Gordon so his friends will listen to him. But ""being Gordon"" doesn't work out as well as he thought it would.

Henry's Health & Safety- Henry has an accident and is being repaired at the Steamworks. When he explains what happened, Victor comments, ""Health and Safety, Henry."" Henry doesn't know what that means so Kevin explains. When he's repaired and headed back out on the tracks Victor reminds him, ""Watch out now for Health and Safety. Anything dangerous must be taken away."" Henry spends the rest of the day moving flatbeds of telegraph poles and wire out of the way. Later, Percy is looking for the missing items and Sir Topham Hatt is angry that someone moved them. Henry realizes he needs to ask before moving everything he sees on the tracks.

Happy Hiro- Thomas sees that Hiro is unhappy and although Hiro tells him he's simply homesick, Thomas thinks he knows what will make Hiro feel better. He drags him all over the island, to no avail, until he finally realizes Hiro told him exactly what was wrong and he just didn't listen. Thomas makes it right by taking Hiro to a place that will make him feel less homesick.

Mr. Perkins Clips- Mr. Perkins thinks the Engine Driver's Common Room could use some color on the walls, so he decides to paint a picture of some lovely red tomatoes. But he keeps knocking over his canvases and making terrible mistakes. He wonders if he can turn his mistakes into a completely different picture all-together. (This is one of my favorite of the Mr. Perkins storylines!)",1413504000,,2420,4.725118483412322
