When you get over the soreness of the newly and impeccably stretched mucsles and limbs you will feel like a new person and will want to preserve this video forever. No part of your pbody is left out. It is that amazing.",1260144000,,382,4.2465753424657535
7909576,4,6305194629,"This DVD is less strenuous than something like Baron Baptiste or Brian Kest.  It moves along though and you aren't just sitting there meditating.  There are some different moves in this DVD like bicycling your legs and side leg lifts that seemed strange to me in a yoga practice but when I did them I found that they really relaxed my back and hips.  There wasn't much sitting in a pose and holding it--instead you did active things like rolling up and down, or rolling back into a kind of halfway plow pose and then opening your legs into a ""v"" while you are up there.  Wai Lana has a heavy accent but I could still understand her for the most part.  At first I thought she is silly with her bright outfits and singing but then I started really liking her because she has such a happy expression on her face and she gives off such good energy.  You won't be stretched out and exhausted like at the end of a power yoga workout but instead a feeling of calm and happiness comes over you.  I recommend this for a nice change of pace.",1100822400,2,1031,4.256410256410256
7909577,5,6305194629,"I absolutely love Wai Lana's Relaxation Video. There is something soothing about her voice both in her instruction and singing that makes me look forward to my yoga session with her everyday. The breathtaking scenery, music, beautiful outfits along with Wai Lana's personality makes this video unlike any I've seen before. The poses are not too difficult but I still feel like I've had a good workout when I'm finished, making my body feel great and definitely less stressed. I will highly recommend this video to anyone taking up the practice of yoga.",1071705600,3,552,4.946236559139785
