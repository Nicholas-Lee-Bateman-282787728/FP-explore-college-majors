745866,3,6303980082,"Is a young woman expected to have sex when she makes the decision to attend a party at a frat house, whether or not she maintains consciousness? Or, can she expect to be able to pass out anywhere, even among drunk and horny college boys, and remain unmolested? The film approaches this and other date rape situations with an earnest and fairly comprehensive examination of the subject from both male and female perspectives. This film brought back many memories of college life for me. Even though I had not taken part in Greek life at THE Ohio State University, I vividly recall many discussions of this sort. This, coupled with the fact the film was shot entirely in Ohio, my home state, drew me into the film probably more than it deserved to do. I enjoy watching Allison Smith, and I also wanted to see Kim Walker (of ""Heathers"" fame) in one of the too few roles she graced before tragically passing away in 2001. This is not a great film, but it is certainly worth seeing at least once. Unfortunately, the DVD is full screen only and has no subtitle options. The transfer is pretty clean and crisp, however, and there is some bonus material as well.",1182729600,4,1154,4.552884615384615
745867,3,6303980082,"1995's ""A Reason to Believe"" has gained notoriety over the years as the low-budget film where Holly Marie Combs, of ""Charmed"" fame, does a topless love scene. This is unfair, as the film, shot ""on a shoestring"" by first-time director Douglas Tirola, is a remarkably well-made, sensitive look at date rape, and the aftermath to both the victim, and those around her. Without resorting to either preaching or titillation, the film remains one of the better dramas of an issue that continues to plague college campuses.

The heroine of the story is young Charlotte (Allison Smith), a popular sorority girl, who, against the wishes of her boyfriend, Wesley (Danny Quinn, son of Oscar winner Anthony Quinn), attends a frat party alone, where she is raped by Wesley's best friend, Jim (Jay Underwood). As Jim brags of his 'conquest', Charlotte goes through a period of self-loathing and denial, until Jim's version destroys her relationship with Wesley, the friendship of her sorority sisters, and makes her an unwilling 'Cause' for the campus feminist group. Forced to take a stand, she finds her reputation smeared by Jim, his fraternity, and even her ex-friends, until the Dean (""Animal House"" 'Neidermeyer', Mark Metcalf), calls in both parties to learn the truth...

While the fraternity scenes are more 'Delta House' than real, the chain of events rings true (Jim's girlfriend, so devoted that she'd rather lie about Charlotte than 'lose' him; Wesley's 'rebound' bedmate, played with conviction by Combs, becoming another victim of Jim's unwanted attentions). Even an eyewitness to the rape (Keith Coogan, great-grandson of Jackie) cannot come forward, as he is a 'druggie' who would not be believed, only arrested if he spoke out.

To Tirola's credit, he never permits the film to slide into melodrama, preferring to allow events to unfold naturally. The limited budget forces the film's resolution to be a bit rushed, and 'pat', but will still satisfy most viewers.

""A Reason To Believe"" deserves praise for the quality 'look' it achieves (on a budget of under $200,000), the timeliness of the issues it addresses, and several outstanding performances. To remember it solely for a few moments of nudity does it a disservice!",1137715200,20,2227,5.143646408839779

7857611,3,6303980082,Bought movie because of Holly Marie Combs. Most of the acting from almost everyone is horrible. Movie/story did not inspire me to care what it was about. Getting the movie because of Miss Combs was not worth the expense. Her one small non-speaking scene does not make up for everyone else's lack of talent.,1475798400,,306,4.685185185185185
