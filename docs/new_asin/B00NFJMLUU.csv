6648102,5,B00NFJMLUU,"To me i am giving it 5 stars for Robin Williams who will be Missed
For the show i have to honest i have not seen Season 4 so i am not Sure if there was a Season 5.
For a show to Last more than 2 Seasons is good.
If you do not have all the Seasons already the sure get the whole Collection but if you do then getting this Seasons seems to be a good idea.
To me it was just sad for the Loss of Robin Williams for them to Bring this back out.
There are so many other great Seasons like C.H.I.P.S and more like Hart to Hart that need to come out but are not.
So All in All A great TV show and Shows now a days are not classics Yet.
More reruns of the classics are good
So to all Fans good luck",1415750400,8,689,3.5695364238410594
6648103,5,B00NFJMLUU,"Mork and Mindy Season #4 was my favorite season. It was wonderful to see their friendship evolve into a relationship, and it was both touching and often hilarious to see the challenges they went through, both in getting married and of course raising Mearth.

So glad this will finally be available! Really enjoyed this when it was on T.V., and look forward to seeing it again!",1414195200,18,376,4.696969696969697
6648104,5,B00NFJMLUU,I really like Mork & Mindy!  I think Robin Williams was really great in his role as Mork!,1414108800,15,89,3.9444444444444446
6648105,5,B00NFJMLUU,I can't believe it's finally released!!  I have been been waiting and never saw the whole thing!!  I thank Jesus for this release!!!,1414022400,12,132,4.695652173913044
6648106,3,B00NFJMLUU,"I'm a very big Mork and Mindy fan. I'm thrilled that this is finally going to be released---even if the 'push' ultimately was Williams suicide. This last season of the ABC series which did make him a household name took several creative risks. Some of them worked, and others not so well.

In order to keep the series 'fresh', Mork and Mindy got married and had a baby (played by Willams's mentor Jonathan Winters). There is a trippy 4 episode story arc involving courtship, wedding and pregnancy. Exidor of all people(!!) apparently has a degree in Orkian ob/gyn. Exidor is the one person who accurately determined Mork was pregnant (""Three The Hard Way""). And then for a couple of episodes, we see the show attempt to shift from Mork observing earth---to Mork and Mindy learning how to successfully raise a blended family. Mearth too deals with these issues. Because of Winters age, he is on camera more than 'child' actors who are subject to labor laws.

Mearth however did not work as a 'scripting focus' for the series. Orson himself erased Mork's mind in ""I Don't Remember Mama"". Another good episode from this season is ""Cheerleader in Chains"". Mindy is so dedicated to the ethical practice of her journalism that she (and then Mork) ultimately spend a night in jail for the cause. She got a new boss at the station in ""Metamorphisis, The TV Show"", Mr. Sternhagen is fired.

Look for special guest stars like Barbara Billingsley, Paul Reubens, and William Shatner. Special Features include the two 'Happy Days episodes which Mork originally appeared/appeared. (Mork and Mindy was a Happy Days spin off). No, this isn't the 'best season' of the series, but it completes the collection of serious fans.",1413244800,17,1707,4.859106529209622

6648120,5,B00NFJMLUU,"I didn't watch Mork and Mindy when it first came out. I started about 6 years ago. And yet I absolutely fell in love with this show at the get go. Me and my two children, who are now 4 and 7, and my husband watch this together as a family numerous times. We all watch this. If you're a robin Williams fan, then you will definitely enjoy this.
By the way, I actually purchased this in store. And it costed more. Wish I found out about this on Amazon earlier. I would've saved some money.",1468368000,,486,4.072916666666667

6648134,5,B00NFJMLUU,I still have trouble with the fact that Mork and Mindy fans who have been waiting 7 years or longer for this had to wait till Robin William to die to get them to release this. Anyhow Johnathan winters was equally funny as Robin Williams. I didn't remember the series ending the way it did(how anti-climactic).Then again it's been 30+ years since I saw the last series.,1439510400,,368,4.507462686567164

Spoiler Alert! - It was kind of awkward that they chose to use a fully grown man as Mork & Mindy's child, but hey, I guess they were thinking outside the box.",1434326400,,269,3.909090909090909

6648155,3,B00NFJMLUU,Definitely the weakest seasons but it's always fun to watch Robin Williams do his thing.  Jonathan Winters is hillarious too.,1421452800,,125,5.25
6648156,5,B00NFJMLUU,Love watching the show again.  Watched every show when it was on and love watching it now.  Robin Williams was great the way he made Mork come alive in every show.,1421193600,,163,4.225806451612903
6648157,5,B00NFJMLUU,"Finally, the Jonathan Winters episodes! Who cares about the plots of the individual episodes. It's just fun seeing the two late improv masters interacting.",1421107200,,155,5.5
6648158,5,B00NFJMLUU,"This is the final episodes of Mork & Mindy. Sad that it took Robin Williams ""DEATH"" to release it. The fun continues in this three disc collection(Staring Robin Williams as ""MORK"" and Pam Dawber as ""MINDY"" and Funny man Jonathan Winters as Mearth their own (hybrid son.) In this three disc set. Mork & Mindy get ""MARRIED"" Mork becomes pregnant and a egg is inside him, he gives birth through is navel which he never had before. The egg gets bigger and it sit's in a big nest. Until it hatches and out pop's Mearth a grown man put a mind of a small child. You see Orkins where is Mork from their children are born grown then convert back to a baby. It is very ""FUNNY!!!"" Plus they have other adventures!!! I will not say,""YOU!"" will have to buy it to find out. I will tell ""YOU!"" this It has Special Features: 2 HAPPY DAYS EPISODES Featuring ""MORK"" IN HIS TV DEBUT... AND GAG REELS!",1420934400,,881,4.313253012048193

6648160,5,B00NFJMLUU,Finally!!!!!!!,1420675200,,14,14.0
6648161,5,B00NFJMLUU,I think this is one of the best shows on television. I can watch it again over 30 years later and laugh just like I did when it came on regular television. It has stood the test of time. Robin Williams and the character of Mork were a once in a lifetime gift. There will never be another Robin Williams and there will never be another Mork!,1419811200,8,340,4.08955223880597
6648162,5,B00NFJMLUU,Great,1419120000,2,5,5.0
6648163,3,B00NFJMLUU,"I can see why season 4 was the final season.  Don't get me wrong, I love Mork and Mindy, but the things that bothered me about the last season are, they cut Gina Hecht (Jean DaVinci) and Jay Thomas (Remo DaVinci) out completely.  I liked those characters and the diner/restaurant they ran.  I also thought by adding the diner/restaurant, that it gave the show another place to go to instead of just shooting mostly everything in Mindy's apartment.  Lastly, season 4 just gets kind of weird and goes a little overboard with Mearth.  I know everybody loves Jonathon Winters, but I didn't find him all that funny, except a few times.  I will definitely keep season 4 and watch it again, but the first 3 seasons really are the best.  It's a shame they never had a series finale, but that's how it goes most of the time I guess.  We will always love and miss you Robin Williams!  Well, until next time..Nanu Nanu.",1418947200,15,908,4.487804878048781

6648165,5,B00NFJMLUU,5 stars because we were able to buy season 4 without having to repurchase the first three.  I love this show and am so thrilled to be able to see it again.  Great christmas gifts for sure. This show was so far fetched and Mr. Winters just added to the comedy. Gotta love it. Sorry we had to lose Robin to get this release but thats the industry all abt. the nickle. RIP Robin and the rest of the cast that have departed for ork but left us with so much enjoyment. We miss all of you but you are still bringing much laughter and this is a treasure for sure.,1418169600,5,556,4.0
6648166,5,B00NFJMLUU,Very strange this is not coming out on Region 2 - only on the Complete Series 1-4 boxset.  Wonder why?  The other three seasons were released on Region 2.,1417996800,2,154,4.275862068965517
6648167,5,B00NFJMLUU,"I've been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD. This was my favorite season but I'm concerned though. In the description it says that the forth season is on 1 disc. There were 22 episodes in season 4, how are they getting all of the episodes on one disc? Season 3 had 22 episodes and that season was a 4 disc set. I will purchase this, but I have my concerns that they will not have all of the episodes.

UPDATE: I just read on tvshowsondvd.com that the 4th season is on 3 discs. It must be a typo here on Amazon. We will see in a couple of days.",1417478400,11,553,3.9375
6648168,5,B00NFJMLUU,"Thank goodness season 4 has finally been released!!!  Can't wait to see the wedding and honeymoon episodes again after 30 plus years.  Am also looking forward to seeing Mearth ""hatch"" again!  Mork and Mindy was one of the best TV shows around at the time.",1416009600,4,255,4.622222222222222
6648169,5,B00NFJMLUU,"Season 4 is good, too. Jonathan Winters is a great addition to the cast of Mork & Mindy. He portrays Mearth quite well and knows how to bring the character to life!! Like I said before, both he and Robin Williams are a good duo on screen. It seems like all 3 of them (Robin Williams, Jonathan Winters, and Pam Dawber) have great chemistry. It's a blast to see Robin and Jonathan going off script. Robin Williams will never be forgotten!!",1415836800,10,437,4.407407407407407
