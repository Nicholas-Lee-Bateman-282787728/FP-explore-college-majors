8752101,3,B01C3JYHG8,"Well, this is actually a partial re-release of the original series by Filmation, in 8 episodes. I was fooled because of the updated artwork and the fact that it said Copyright Dreamworks 2016. I got it home and played it, and it was just that, a re-release. If you're a fan of these and don't want to pay the high prices online for the original sets, then I think you're in luck, because it looks like Classic Media is re-releasing them, via Dreamworks Distribution. So pick this up if you don't already have it, otherwise give it a pass.",1465862400,4,538,4.444444444444445
