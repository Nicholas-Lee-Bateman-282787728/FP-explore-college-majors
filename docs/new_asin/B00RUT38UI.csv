6935695,5,B00RUT38UI,"I have to write this review because I thought the previous negative comments about the background music were really unfounded. I am glad I went ahead and purchase the DVD. I thought the background music was appropriate and the rest of the contents were well filmed and produced. For someone who has no knowledge about airshows, these 3 DVDs provided great insights into the amount of work and planning required to make airshows possible.

Plus, the images contained in the DVDs are sharp and the colors are very vibrant.

All in all, I would say there is really nothing to complain about the DVDs and they are well worth the money!",1317513600,2,631,4.675675675675675
6935696,2,B00RUT38UI,"This video has some very good video, but there is very little of it. So little that, in fact, with a few exceptions, by the time you get to halfway through the second disc, you will have seen everything there is to see.

The editing of this set is horrible. The music is very annoying, preventing you from hearing the sound of the airplanes. The commentary is also very horrible, constantly repeating itself and saying useless information.
Don't bother watching the 'extras', they are previews of the videos in the next disc.
The menu is also poorly designed, as the background movie/sound restarts every time you hit enter to move around the menu. Also, it is so poorly designed, that on the last disc, it is not possible to watch the bonus balloon movie because it is not possible to highlight it to watch it, as the entry prior to it is impossible to highlight without it automatically starting.

Overall, this is definitely not a good buy. The interviews of pilots (some of whom are disgustingly arrogant) are repeated across all the discs, cut up and played in different order and mixed up. You have to skip through a very annoying opening and closing movie for every video you want to watch. There are about three or four shots of an airshow audience, and they are the same ones used for every aircraft pass.
By the end of the set, it has become extremely boring, as there is nothing new. I could not count how many times they showed the footage of the recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was repeated over and over.
One more thing, is that the footage is old. It is good High Definition, but you do not even hear about new airplanes.",1310774400,2,1649,4.511705685618729
6935697,4,B00RUT38UI,I found this Air Show movie to be very good and for the price its a great deal. On the site it clearly says it will only play in Region (A) which is US & Canada. I live in Australia which is Region (B) and it plays on my Panasonic DMP-BD45 player which is locked to Region (B) movies. So to those people in Region (B) you might have the same luck as me if you buy this movie.,1306540800,,375,3.759493670886076
6935698,3,B00RUT38UI,video was great. I have never been to an air show before where music was played so loud it drowned out the roar of the engines and ruined the show.,1302134400,,147,3.933333333333333
6935699,1,B00RUT38UI,The visual quality and shots are crystal clear.  Very well made...BUT I was very disappointed in that there was a very annoying musical soundtrack that couldn't be turned off.  I am a purist and just want to hear the sounds of the airplanes and airshow.,1300579200,7,253,4.6
6935700,5,B00RUT38UI,"Definite five stars!  This brought back a lot of pleasant memories as the DVD covers airshows that I've been at: San Marcos TX, Wings Over Houston, Ft Worth Alliance and Little Rock AFB.  The name of a high school classmate who's in the CAF was also brought up
(it was positive, Gordon!)  I will enjoy showing this to my grandkids.  They highlight the Thunderbirds, Sean Tucker and other airshow greats.  if you like flight, don't miss this one.  Definitley worth the money.",1298160000,2,474,4.719512195121951
