8724149,5,B011ECWG0E,"Very enjoyable. I found the staging somewhat like a Broadway play, and liked that. The measured, lengthy dialogue was intriguing - somewhat fascinating, almost musical. Film noir lighting and staging - very artistic and supported the tone of the story. Having seen several different actors in the role of Holmes over many years I find I like this one the best - intelligent but not stodgy, charming with his housekeeper, very lightly and affectionately poking fun at Dr. Watson without outright belittling him. Most enjoyable - one I will likely watch and savor again.",1531180800,,568,5.053191489361702
8724150,5,B011ECWG0E,"A great, early, Sherlock Holmes with Arthur Wontner as Holmes and Ian Fleming(nope, not THAT Ian Fleming) as Watson! The first movie to show Holmes up against Moriarty! Very well done! BTW, this is also known as The Sleeping Cardinal! RP",1524009600,,237,4.804878048780488

8724152,5,B011ECWG0E,"Very intriguing twisted tale, which Sherlock solves with his usual aplomb! We enjoyed it, none of the profanity or disturbing images of modern films. Black and white is alright with us!",1515801600,,185,5.0
8724153,5,B011ECWG0E,"Wontner is my favorite Sherlock Holmes, simply because he seems more cerebral than Basil Rathbone (they are very similar looking) The plot is well done and well acted. Liked Fleming as Watson as well, although you can't beat Nigel Bruce as the doddering fool Dr. Watson.",1515196800,,270,4.891304347826087
8724154,4,B011ECWG0E,"Im a big fan of Shelock Holmes and found this movie to be better than most. Arthur Wontner is soundly credible as the master sleuth. The film, though old, is is good shape. Sound too!",1514160000,,183,4.257142857142857
