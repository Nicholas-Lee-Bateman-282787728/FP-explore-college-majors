8748164,3,B01ASGPGHW,"In Alexander Korda's THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII, Charles Laughton's super-human thespian efforts cannot save what is a highly arbitrary and episodic script. Right at the outset Henry's first and most significant marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, is dismissed with a text scroll that describes her as ""a good woman"" whom he divorced and ""we won't deal with her here"" etc.

The king's last wife, Catherine Parr is depicted as a loving caretaker of the Royal heirs, but once married she became quite the ""nag."" After one such session at story's end, Henry addresses the audience thus: ""Six wives, and the best of them's the worst."" Perhaps if we'd been allowed to see the first Cate, that ""best wife"" statement could never have applied to queen #6, thus, it's probably why Aragon was ignored altogether-- to make a final feeble joke possible.

Elsa Lanchester's comically broad portrayal of the rather dull Anne of Cleves is a poorly chosen highlight of the story. Her predecessor, Jane Seymour is around only long enough to die offscreen in childbirth. Wife #2, Anne Boleyn's execution and the moments leading up to it get more coverage than the reason for her beheading, an issue never made clear.

Robert Donat as cuckolder of kings, Thomas Culpepper has more screen time than three of Henry's wives. His affair with wife #5, Catherine Howard ends for her at the chopping block. With this second execution we see only a row of drummers.

In the closing 20 minutes, Laughton's king ages in two blinks from a hale 50 year old to an elderly near-invalid who overeats whenever the final Mrs. Henry isn't looking. For reasons stated, what should've been a triumph for all involved is a failure that almost rises to the level of the very next Korda/Laughton collaboration, the unfinished epic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-CLAUDIUS/dp/B001FRNB9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, CLAUDIUS</a>&nbsp;(1935).
