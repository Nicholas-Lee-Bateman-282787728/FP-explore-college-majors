4904198,4,B005Y423ZC,"A truly phenomenal performer. Oh what a voice she has!

Finally another artist who writes her own stuff and actually performs live. Apart from Lady GaGa, she is one of few who actually does both.

Well worth it if you enjoy a real performer with real talent.",1320710400,22,258,4.468085106382978

4904202,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is one of the world's best known singers today and rightfully so. She can sing any note with spectacular precision. Her concert at Royal Albert Hall in London, England in 2011 is an unforgettable musical event. Every attention to detail is noted to highlight the music. Adele puts on a first rate performance in perhaps one of the world's top concert venues to an excited crowd of fans. Perhaps the best part was when they sang back to her, ""Someone Like You,"" that she had tears in her eyes.

Adele has been well-awarded with Grammys, an Academy Award and even an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She is about 30 years old now and a mother. She will be probably be awarded dame hood someday for her contributions to music. Her voice rises to any occasion. She talks down to earth to the audience about her friends, an ex-boyfriend and her admiration for the late Amy Winehouse.

The DVD comes with a CD and a special feature about behind the scenes of the concert. Perhaps one of the most memorable concerts of Adele's life. If you're an Adele fan, you will definitely want to have this DVD on hand anytime.",1520985600,,1164,4.511848341232228

4904207,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is gifted by God with such a stunning voice. This video gives exceptional sound quality of her vocals along with the great musicians in her band. I love Adele's talking and joking in between songs. She is a sweetheart, and as an added bonus is a great comedian too! She has huge talent as a songwriter and sings those great songs, but does some wonderful covers here also. Filmed in beautiful HD. The only weakness of the DVD is in the editing--whoever edited made really bad choices. We want to see Adele...Adele singing, Adele talking, Adele laughing. But the editor (director?) chose to make constant cutaways to the band, to the audience, to the stage. And not just every now and then; that would have been acceptable. These cutaways happen about every 5 to 10 seconds! Occasionally we get a little longer camera shot on Adele, but not often enough. The YouTube fan videos are better than these editors! At least the YouTube fans keep their cameras mostly on Adele!!  But regardless, the sound of her gifted voice and her wonderful personality lift us higher and above the editing flaws on this DVD. I will give the editors credit for the moments with Adele and her long-time best friend (sitting in the audience)...that was perfect and very touching. Adele and Barbra Streisand are the greatest voices of our time. I feel very blessed to have this recording of Adele, Live At The Royal Albert Hall.",1518307200,,1409,4.727642276422764

4904259,4,B005Y423ZC,"I thoroughly enjoyed the live versions of some of the songs, especially because of the audience sing-along on ""Rolling in the Deep"". It's a pretty eclectic collection of songs, with much of the second half of the cd (except right at the end) consisting of very ""Country-Western"" music, that provides a different flavor from what one expects of Adele. It's interesting to see a very English artist performing in a very American genre.",1481846400,,433,4.945205479452055

4904315,5,B005Y423ZC,"""Adele"" making history at The Royal Albert Hall. Yes, Adele does not hold back with her language and thoughts. She blurts out raw words while telling her life stories in her cocney accent. True, not for the faint of heart. Understanding that, what a thrill to witness her give the background stories of each song she has written.  What a privilege to then listen to her sing those stories. I am forever changed by this talent with the depth and gravity of each song. Rumor has it we watch this concert continually.  Adele Laurie Blue Adkins will give someone like you a reason to set fire to the rain and take it all as you watch and listen to this concert that will have you rolling in the deep endlessly.",1463097600,,706,4.423076923076923

Some can add a new level of entertainment but I found that it almost gave me a headache with the amount of cuts they put in.

4904336,5,B005Y423ZC,"I've seen a ton of live shows and I normally don't like to sit and watch concert videos, but upon hearing her 3rd album ""25"", I had to check out this fine young lady's live show. This was absolutely spectacular! She tells stories about her music and her life and drops some swear words in but that's part of what makes her real. It's captivating to watch her sing. You can clearly see her channel the energy from beyond our realm as she sings. Her music is simple, raw, emotional and truthful. The 100 minutes blazes by on this disc. Adele has that sultry voice and even does scat singing. There are covers done by The Cure and Bob Dylan which will blow you off your sofa! The image is Anamorphic Widescreen and the sound is available in 5.1 or standard stereo. To me, Adele is a lady that stepped out of a Victrola from the 1920s jazz/blues scene and brought sanity and class back to the music of our time.",1459814400,6,907,4.309941520467836

4904344,5,B005Y423ZC,"I must admit up front that I am VERY late to the whole Adele fan train.  I happened to catch a performance on BBC America for her latest album, 25, a couple weeks back and was blown away.  I didn't know any of her songs but that performance was repeated and I recorded it on the DVR and have watched it more than a few times.  I was hoping to find a ""greatest hits"" CD but I guess after just 3 albums it is probably too soon for one.  But I was caught by the fact that this is a DVD and a CD.  Once again I was blown away by her live performance on the DVD and just how down-to-earth she is - almost like you are certain you'd be best friends (despite the fact I'm old enough to be her mother).  The CD is great but it is just the songs, none of her chatter which sometimes when I listen to the CD I sort of miss that chat between songs on the DVD.  And boy, can this girl chat!

You really can't go wrong with this.  Royal Albert Hall is spectacular and her performance is beautiful and lovely.  At one point in the concert she mentions as she sits down in a chair that part of it is because she's being lazy and her feet hurt but part of it is because she wants the audience to feel like they are just sitting having a coffee together.  That sentiment REALLY is felt by the home audience.  The camera work is also very well done and is visually appealing.",1458691200,,1357,3.9667896678966788

I could not bear watching the DVD because of this but I tried to anyway because I bought the DVD to ""watch"" Adele perform. Well there was no way I could finish watching this dvd much longer.

She speaks with such candor and isn't afraid to call from her experiences. She is a gem and this is well worth watching and listening to.

Listeners can't listen at a proper level, because all they get is a freaking punch in the face of Adele with a faint whisper of the band.  Such a tragic mistake and poor artistic choice by the mastering mixer.  What a shame.  Ruined.",1444176000,,394,4.735294117647059
4904466,3,B005Y423ZC,"Great music.  However, we didn't realize that Adele would be swearing as much as she did.  I realize that it's her concert and critics be dammed.  The problem is that we weren't aware of this and happened to start watching it with our 7 year old grandson in the room with us.  Luckily, he wasn't paying attention and didn't notice.  I guess I'm from the old school who believes that you show more class if you watch what you say.  She said that she would need to watch what she said, but apparently that went out the window.  Would I recommend it?  No.  I'd just get the cd with only the music.  My daughter passed away a few years ago and we heard one of her songs when we were out of town decompressing from the horror of it all.  My husband wanted to get the dvd as it meant alot to him.  Now, he feels bad that he even had me order it.",1442620800,,839,4.048780487804878

ALL the songs, I could really relate to! 110% recommended to ANYONE & EVERYONE, even if you have never owned any CD's of hers.... A guaranteed LOVE of a wonderful singer with a very powerful voice & pure talent, who always includes her fans/audience into her concerts/songs.... before purchasing ANY of her other older CD's I would purchase THIS one FIRST!

4904653,3,B005Y423ZC,"She's a good singer and the DVD/CD combo is also a good value. However, the downside is her continuous dialogue in between most songs. All singers, including the big stars do this but not as much as Adele on this particular album. Each one is almost 5 mins long and detracts from the show IMHO. I know she's a Cockney and has the gift of the gab, but do we need to hear her yapping so much?!...........",1397692800,,402,4.233766233766234

4904660,5,B005Y423ZC,"I more commonly write reviews for performances of Debussy songs, or of opera recitals, or of Bach violin partitas, with a little rock and pop thrown in, generally withholding my opinions concerning Kanye West (just because he thinks he's a genius doesn't mean he isn't) or Miley, who represents not the domain of music but of Baudrillard's ""precession of the simulacra."" But here it all comes together. I own both 19 and 21, and good as these are, as much as they reward repeated listening, this live performance at the Royal Albert Hall transcends these, and is perhaps as good a live vocal performance as I have ever heard on record. So technically assured is Adele that we might use the word diva, but she projects, at least on stage, a touching humility. Everything here soars and thrills. Adele shapes and interprets these songs as if they're works of towering significance. By turns powerful and exquisite, generous and broken, healing yet projecting the impossibility of true healingAdeles performances here represent the realm where art and entertainment find common ground. Be cautioned, however, that this is in fact a live performance, with a crowd of devotees pouring adulation on the performer, and when they sing along at Adeles request, its almost tragicomically plain: virtually every single person in the audience is female.",1395446400,,1341,5.072398190045249

4904683,4,B005Y423ZC,"I will never give a 5 rating as there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" album.  At the end of the day, this is ""Blue Eyed Soul"" at its best.  Her vocal skill set trumps Joss Stone and her approach to the genre is to add, not take away.  Compliment, not insult.  her style is not for everyone, but if you want to expand you music palette, then this is what you want.  I'm a collector, so if I buy an album and like it, I'm going to buy the complete catalog.  I personally was not disappointed with this purchase.",1388361600,,508,4.03

4904686,4,B005Y423ZC,"I saw some of this video on YouTube and had to buy it. The audio quality is excellent, and Adele sounds flawless!

My only problem for this video is the way it is edited. Whoever edited the video component got very happy with the ""slow motion"" button. There are literally dozens of times when the video is in slow motion, and it doesn't help the entertainment value of the video. The audio is quite perfect, and that's the most important feature IMO.

Yes, I am sure her European tone had something to do with it, but I did not care.  Her music was relaxing and music to get you going.  My husband at first said ... oh great another chick cd ... but after hearing her sing, he was surprised at how much he enjoyed it.

In today's music world, it's always surprising hearing the artist's voice during a live performance matches exactly like the recording.  Her rendition of her biggest hit ""Someone Like You"" was the highlight of the night-- especially after hearing the background story of how the song came about.

We can expect new directions in every interpretation of hersongs,andthis is no exception! You can have a different version spiced with a new melody note, arrangment or vocal texture as well.

She is passionate and soulful.  What he didn't like, though, was her potty mouth when bantering with the audience.  It didn't bother me a bit---after all, she is young and exuberant.

I had heard only a few Adele songs before but after listening to this DVD I am a true believer.  This is not a manufactured voice, this is sheer vocal talent. She really engaged her audience and while sometimes I found it off-putting I realised it provided relief from the sheer intensity of raw  emotion conveyed by her music.  Her lyrics are so beautiful but often so sad......

The quality of the sound on the DVD I found to be excellent.  This DVD is worth adding to your collection",1370736000,,579,4.364485981308412

I like to see the performers, and don't put a lot into move music disc evaluations for the picture unless it's really distracting. This is just her, no frills. But the music matters, and this is recorded very well. It's the disc you want to take when you audition a new pair of speakers.

4904754,5,B005Y423ZC,"The mighty Adele and her little concert in the heart of London town, at the Royal Albert Hall no less. That lofty venue is often filled by pomp and ceremony and with Adele, you get none of that....just her amazing voice. A voice that touches and flourishes in whatever part of the world you are listening in.

A lot has already been said about her ability to convey so much through her music and its all true, so I will focus this review on why I think you should run, not walk to buy this DVD.

1. Her music. Her voice. Her interpretations of her songs and classic covers.

2. Her banter. I know many have said that she swears a bit, but I'm a Brit, and that is how most of us communicate. She isn't trying to sell your a version of herself, she is just being herself and I love her for it. You get a real view of a young woman from London and this DVD captures her awe of playing in such a venerable establishment. Whilst most artists would put on airs and graces in such surroundings, the fact that she doesn't says a sh*tload about her. She shares the stories of what she was going through when writing her songs and that insight makes the experience better for it. If you love the artist, love what she represents cos that gives her the ability to write songs that come straight from her heart and touches that part in all of us that can relate. I do wish that my American friends would get off their moral high horses about swearing.....its daily life in the world that I and Adele come from. If you want to pretend that you live in such a perfect cookie cutter world that has nothing to do with being the BIGGEST affecting problem facing your southern neighbours and their drug wars...that you have not got involved in wars with no relevance to you (except you need something from those countries), then by all means remain in a state of blissful 50's innocence when swearing is the biggest crime imaginable.

3. The audience. No screaming fans just cos they love her and she is the zeitgeist of the moment but because we adore everything her voice does for us. Some touching audience shots show how her music bring couples, friends and maybe even strangers closer together. I love the shot of loving couples clinging to each other and singing her words to each other. It means something more to them than just a song. The bits when the audience sing Someone like you back to Adele is heartwarming and uplighting and clearly touches a tearful Adele.

4. The simple staging. How many other superstars can get away with so little on stage and yet impact on us more that those artists who have to fill their shows with a complete circus act to create the spectacle.

5. The film. I have the UK version and I am not at all sure what you get in the US but I found the cinematography perfect, so I wholeheartedly disagree with complains on the quality. Its a brilliant conceived, simple execution. You get Adele, end of.

6. Her laugh - its frigging infectious and uplifting.

Buy it if you want to experience a global talent with her feet securely rooted in reality, but whose voice transcends gravity.",1366934400,,3104,4.414335664335664
4904755,5,B005Y423ZC,"My originally bought the DVD...it's OK, the lower resolution was very evident on
certain scenes, where jaggies were visible on a 42 inch screen.  The blu ray cured
all that, and audio seems much clearer too ( I don't know if there is technical backing
to this observation ).  Adele sings her heart out in this concert, and I have enjoyed
playing this disc at least a half dozen times already....a real keeper!

Miss Adele has a potty mouth and uses it during the breaks between songs. Since I don't use this type of language and protect children from it...I feel it was money down the toilet.

From start to finish, a wonderful, and emotional roller-coaster for Adelle, fans, and you alike.
Have tissues handy! Right off the bat, Adelle's ""colorful"" language flows just like the words of her songs. Between songs, she rambles down memory lane, taking everyone with her. This is her moment, she has waited for all her life.

4904764,1,B005Y423ZC,"I am sad because I really like Adele, unfortunately there is serious problems for the viewer on this DVD. Picture is good when camera can stay focus long enough, but never stays focus in one picture more then 3 seconds... The problem starts with the director trying way to hard to show anything and everything in Albert Hall but Adele... After 2 songs you already tired trying to fallow these multiple cameras moving from pic. to pic. every 2 to 3 seconds, non stop... and I mean non stop!... She can not even finish her sentence and the camera already moved away. It just makes you upset because kills you concentration and takes the fun away. Obviously this is a work of an amateur. Adele and musicians were all good but the directing killed it. Sorry Adele...",1365984000,7,762,4.569343065693431

4904768,5,B005Y423ZC,"This DVD/CD is the best, and I don't always say that!  You look into the private world of Adele when watching the DVD, and what a spectacular place - The Royal Albert Hall.  Adele's heartfelt introduction to her best friend; her sad, melancholy and at times funny reflections on the songs and why she wrote them are all perfectly good reasons to watch the DVD.  If you just like Adele, you will love her music after this encounter.  Sit back, relax and be prepared to be entertained!  The CD has all Adele's hit songs and more. One incredible voice.  Only disappointment was that the CD is not a complete version of the concert.  I would have enjoyed to hear Adele's commentary to go along with the tunes...

After the first time I watch this, I'm not going to want to hear all the jabbering and potty-mouth ramblings.

4904799,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is always amaising. This is just Adele being Adele. She is quite nervous and outspoken when talking to the audience. Totally confident and just perfect when singing. Amaising. The song are most from 21 album, very little from 19.",1362009600,,235,4.9
4904800,5,B005Y423ZC,"Her voice is amazing, her song writing skills are excellant.
Her story telling & audience interface are well received.

I loved the music and hearing Adele talk about why the songs were written.  It brought a total different feeling to the music.  I ended up watching the concert two times within a week and listen to the CD with a different feeling than I had before watching the DVD.  The concert was FAB-U-LOUS and made me more of a fan of Adele's than I was before.",1361750400,,370,4.257142857142857

4904816,5,B005Y423ZC,"What a disc!  The sound quality at the Royal Albert Hall is stunning on my surround sound system.  Adele's rendition of the Bonnie Raitt classic ""I can't make you love me"" is better than Bonnie's!  Simply stunning vocals and Adele's band is spot on.  The engineer who mixed this disc is a genius.

This has become a reference blu-ray disc for my system.  I have tested a number of tweaks (like isolate it sorbothane hemispheres) using this disc.  It's that good.",1360022400,,462,4.62962962962963

4904825,2,B005Y423ZC,"I LOVE Adele, and her performance is amazing, but impossible to watch on this blu-ray or DVD.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the constant cuts every few seconds are nauseating.  You can't even focus your eyes on anything, because the views change so fast.  What a shame.  Hopefully, Adele's next concert video will have a different editor/director who will let us watch her mesmerizing performance.",1359072000,,403,5.153846153846154

4904830,2,B005Y423ZC,"I Love Adele's music and was very much looking forward to this concert dvd. After two songs I left the headphones on and left the room. The music is live Adele, which is exquisite. But the video direction is nauseating.  The director has many beautiful and grand camera angles at his disposal. Unfortunately, he feels he has to use every one on every song.  There is absolutely no ""soul"" or feeling to the editing of the visuals, it's just a never ending series of cut after cut after cut completely destroying the mood of every song. It reminds me of watching a 1960s variety show with 2 minutes to cram every angle you've got into the time limit, but it never stops.  I'll definitely continue to listen to the cd, but seriously doubt I'll ever watch the blu ray again.  A bummer indeed.",1358121600,,788,4.489510489510489

4904834,1,B005Y423ZC,"It's too bad the directing is so awful, because this is a great concert. However, the director/editor must have a huge ego, as there are so many quick cuts that it is very hard to watch. The video never lingers on anything for more than 4 seconds, and the view jumps around about 40 times per minute. Very lame and distracting from the music!",1357862400,10,342,4.359375
4904835,5,B005Y423ZC,Fantastic!  She has the most awesome sound.  I especially like that she composes her songs herself.  Cannot wait until she puts out a new CD.,1357862400,,141,4.56

4904845,5,B005Y423ZC,"Absolutely Unbelievable! I suggest you watch it with subtitles the first time, because she's quite hilarious, but her accent is quite thick, & I missed comments without the subtitles. You ALSO get a CD of the songs she sings in the concert - some of which are covers, making this a valuable addition to your Adele collection - especially since we don't know when she'll put out another CD!",1356566400,,389,4.6521739130434785

4904848,5,B005Y423ZC,"I came across the music (MP3s) of this concert initially, then when discovered this was available on dvd as well, I purchased the cd/dvd combo pack, uncensored version.  Miss Adele gave wonderful performances, outstanding vocals, and engaged with the audience in her humble yet very forthright (and uncensored) way.  Every performance I have ever seen at Royal Albert Hall has been amazing.  I think there is a chemistry or karma the musicians feel about the honor of performing in the Hall, and that comes through in both their behaviour and their sound.  Miss Adele exemplifies this.  Absolutely love this cd/dvd, recommend highly!

Please note this cd/dvd IS available in a censored version for those who do not wish to hear certain words or language used.  Adele tried to humble herself, but in the end she did spout a few less than desireable 4-letter words.  Personally, I love that about Adele, she's sweet, humble, grateful to her audience and to the opportunity of playing in such a ""royal"" venue... however, she is also true to herself, and her genuine natural self.

(Have just discovered the recordings - mp3s - of Pink Floyd in The Royal Albert Hall.... also quite fabulous!)",1356307200,,1188,4.9296482412060305

4904852,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is a real artist.  She does not dance or dress in other characters; which is a great thing.

4904855,3,B005Y423ZC,"I had high hopes for this video. I like Adele and her music so I figured I'd love the video. But I don't. It is nearly unwatchable because they change the camera angle literally every second, sometimes twice per second! Also the quantity of foul language from Adele is completely unnecessary and gratuitous. It gets three stars only because she sounds great while singing. In fact, I enjoy this video more with my eyes closed. Why did I even buy a VIDEO??",1355097600,,455,4.560975609756097
4904856,4,B005Y423ZC,"This is the 3rd Royal Albert titles concert I have watched, the video on all 3 is unimaginative, but not terrible.

Adele is a powerful singer in every respect and it comes across on the video.

Adele knows how to play her audience, this is evident.

Like the Sting concert, I guess the most common pronoun and adverb in the English Language is now the F bomb, at least for these two performers. I didn't get it at the Sting concert and I don't get it with Adele. Perhaps British for ""I'm not a silver spoon?""

Anyway great display of her talents, but her mouth takes away from her brilliant performance.",1354752000,,604,4.414414414414415

4904860,3,B005Y423ZC,"It is not up to me to judge Adele as she has been very successful and I like her music yet here is my opinion: If you are going to Video a concert first make sure Adele is compleltely over her chest cold, second I wish she would not let the Audience sing while she holds the Mic (Probably to rest her voice yet most singers do that anyway) because it is distracting unless you like to hear 10,000 people trying to sing, and Thirdly put a warning on the label ""Foul Language"". I did not know Adele had so much anger yet I suppose that anger and language is her persona. How can I judge such a successful singer? I cannot, but put the kids to bed first unless they are used to foul language. YET, I would BUY another. 3 stars for this concert that could have easily have been 5 Star if she had not been sick and all the other stuff. Again, I still Love her music.",1354233600,,861,4.04093567251462

Her live performances of all the songs you would expect, and maybe a few you wouldn't, do not disappoint. You will laugh and cry along with her as you hear her personal and emotional commitment to her music and in her performance. Also the CD included is great because it is simply just the songs, none of the talking in between. But don't get me wrong, Adele is pretty entertaining in her small talk between songs. If you're thinking of getting this, DO IT!! You won't regret it.",1352073600,,646,4.52991452991453

I don't buy things like this, but I wanted to see the experience.  It's well worth it.  The included cd is in my car on constant rotation and the live versions of these songs are great, with new quirks and choices as well as her crowd banter during the show.

The DVD's camera work was jarring, and Adele's introductions repetitive, endless, and not that illuminating. Add to that all those f-bombs she kept dropping, and I used the ""Advance"" a lot to get to the songs. Yes, I want visuals in a DVD, but what I want most is the MUSIC and I really don't care for explanations what inspired it. (All listeners have their own ideas of what the song means--and it may not be the same as the songwriter's. E.g., Sting's ""Every breath you take"" is basically about a guy stalker, but people play it at their weddings, so there you go...) With her unique voice and delivery, she's obviously destined for a good long career, but this is my first and last Adele DVD.

While Sade offers a super show with stage production, lighting, visual effects, and lots of music one after another, Adele sits on a bench for a monologue with the audience before each song. She talks, talks, talks and talks. So you're tired and decides go forward using the remote control. After some time going ahead, nothing changes, she's still talking. This happens in almost every song. I found it somewhat disrespectful .... I do not recommend this Adele's DVD to anyone.",1346112000,,623,4.571428571428571

I have never experienced a singer who could communicate the emotional essence of her music so powerfully.  You feel like you just had the break up of your life!  Her ability to pull you into her world is unmatched because she makes it so easy to see and feel.

Adele is engaging and witty when she tells what was happening in her life when she wrote most of the songs. She gives her ALL in the performance.

And when your in your car you can listen to the same performance on CD with limited clapping and talking. Just the music...all 17 songs!

I highly recommend this to anyone who is captivated by Adele's amazing gift of voice.

4904908,3,B005Y423ZC,"This lady has an incredible voice that lends itself comfortably to different genres such as jazz, blues and country. However the concert was ruined by her complete lack of education and insensitivity to the fact that not everyone who likes Adele's work enjoys hearing F-bombs every second word. Like a 10 year-old who's just discovered swearing, she uses the F-word much as another person uses adjectives.

Adele, if you want to restrict yourself to concerts in London where your filthy mouth is acceptable, good luck to you. You will find, as you begin to travel the world, that your potty-mouth style will not endear you to the vast majority of the fans you crave.

A very good concert marred by this one, ongoing lapse in judgment.",1339632000,2,734,4.817460317460317

 I see some reviews about bad editing because it shows the band members, the concert hall, and the fans singing in the audience. That's ridiculous. First of all, it's not about how the dang thing looks, it's about the music; Adele is one of the most talented people of our generation. Seeing the audience was great. You get to see how they were feeling. It makes it seem more like you were there, it's like you're standing in the audience and you're looking at the person next to you. The shots of the concert hall make it even better by showing off the dramatically beautiful venue.

 I also see complaints about her language, and people complain that their kids heard her ""potty mouth"". JUST GROW UP. It's a part of life! They're going to be exposed to it. Oh, and why are you showing this to your child in the first place?! It's Adele. Not Barney. She's an adult, talking about adult things.

I've always liked Adele's live version of all her songs better than the studio version. They're generally slower and more emphatic.

The audience singing along is pretty cool, and obviously affects Adele.

As others have said, it's so nice to see a real, talented singer (unlike the hideous Gaga) who can sing acapella, or with just a piano-amazing, the power and feeling in her voice. The words aren't bad either-the first time I played ""Someone like you"" for my girlfriend (before it was being played on the radio) she started crying and it kind of blew me away!

4904924,5,B005Y423ZC,"A bit of a wonderful enigma, this Adele is.

On the one hand, she's one of the truly great vocalists of our time.  A voice so full of nuance and emotion that she pulls your heart strings every which way, and often transports you into the past, a past partly real and partly imagined.  She's a youngster, yet she sings with a maturity that suggests already having lived a long and rich life.

On the other hand, when she banters with the audience, she can be downright crass, making it clear that her British background has almost surely not been upper-crusty.  Her youth becomes strikingly evident.

The enigma actually works though, because it gives Adele an air of authenticity.  Enough to convince me that she's the real deal, a rarely wonderful diamond in the rough who's now being cut and polished, with the result that her brilliance is quickly sparkling more and more brightly, indeed dazzling us.

I look forward to experiencing what her evolution as an artist will bring.  I can only imagine ... or maybe I can't.  Meanwhile, watch this live performance and try to catch this shooting star!",1336521600,3,1099,4.706806282722513

4904927,3,B005Y423ZC,"The audio is amazing, and this concert video makes full use of the audio fidelity available via the Blu-Ray format.

The video editing leaves something to be desired.  I found myself wishing the camera would just... keep... one... angle for one solitary line.  Adele doesn't sing more than 3 words per camera angle.  It's distracting.  You can't get lost in the music, because your eyes are always popped over to a new frame of reference.

Zooms in and out, pans, etc. aren't as distracting - but changing from a front view to an overhead view to a crowd shot to a side angle - all on one line!!  Its simply out of pace with a slow tempo, heart wrenching song. That type of rapid ""pop pop pop"" camera sequencing would be more appropriate for something like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, or Kesha.

Don't get me wrong.  It's my 2nd favorite concert Blu-Ray.  I guess I'm frustrated in that the raw material was there to make this a reference concert disc - bar none.  Close your eyes, relax, and take in the great music - and glance up at the screen every once in awhile.  If you try to watch it intently, you'll fry your eyeballs.

For a point of reference: my favorite concert Blu-Ray is Stevie Nicks, Soundstage.  Compare the video editing on these 2 discs, and you'll understand what I'm talking about.",1335744000,2,1298,4.515021459227468
4904928,1,B005Y423ZC,"She has great voice, the venue is great, but she talks incessantly. It really distracting. I would pass. I don't even want to watch again!!",1335744000,5,139,4.6
4904929,5,B005Y423ZC,"This young woman deserves all her fame, acclaim and stardom. Adele's musical sophistication, instincts and individuality in one so young is extraordinary. And that voice. It's of a full, deep hue, with amazing resonance and ethereal overtones; she uses it consummately, and phrases with a great deal of maturity and skill.

""21"" is by now an international phenomenon, and it's likely to be recognized as one of the seminal, must-have recordings for vocal buffs. This album has crossed over to many varying cultures, and it's not hard to understand why.

It's real. Adele is real, and she sings about real feelings, emotions and nuances. Her lyrics are arrestingly original, of her own vernacular and manner of expressions. Adele is like no one else: and *that* is the mark of a true, individual artist.

What's remarkable about this concert, recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall in September of 2011, is that it is in many ways better than the studio recordings that preceded it. I have one major complaint about the ""21"" album, and that is the dry, digital acoustic. There is no warmth of space around Adele's voice, and she sounds very closely microphoned. Too, the engineering put the recording level way too high so that it causes a serious overload, with the result of distortion. However, on the vinyl incarnation (which I also bought), the levels are somehow much more even and natural.

This DVD, then, appears to put Adele's huge voice, in the space of a large theater, in its proper venue.

What I was not prepared for is how much more mellow, full and sweeter Adele's voice sounds here: it is at times an elemental force of nature.

But what this concert captures is the *compleat* persona of Adele, and you see why she's certifiably, a genuine star artist. Her new, slimmer, blonde look here is quite becoming: she's breathtakingly gorgeous, and the radiance that emanates from her is unmistakeable. Her whole being is out there, larger than life; it jumps out to the audience, her rapport with them sealed, and they're smitten. On the one hand, she's everyone's chatty girlfriend, and friend girl; on the other, she's a song goddess.

Adele is just as captivating speaking as singing: she could easily be a stand-up comic (and is far funnier than some of the ones out there). She's adorably refreshing, spontaneous, and vastly entertaining. Delightfully,laugh-out-loud funny, Adele is as real as real gets, and there's not a phony, pretentious bone in her body. She plays around with her accent, using it with great comic skill to relate her stories.  What also comes through is an absolutely genuine sincerity, and really shows heartfelt appreciation and generosity of spirit to her audiences. Adele has a singular commodity that cannot be bought or faked, and that is charm.

When it comes to the music, however, Adele gets serious, and she delivers, and, as they say, then some. She offers a generous selection from both her ""19"" and ""21"" albums, with a few others included, ""Lovesong,"" ""I Can't Make You Love Me,"" ""If It Hadn't Been For Love,"" and ""Make YOu Feel My Love.""

But the heart of this concert are Adele's own compositions, and in this live setting, they gain an extra excitement and dimension. By the way, there are no thrashing dancers, cheap staging/lighting/special effects to be found here: Adele doesn't need them.

Personally speaking, my favorite number, and her performance of it in this set, is ""Set Fire To The Rain.""  Adele far outdoes her studio rendition here, singing with an inflamed fervor and white-heat passion; her voice soars with amazing abandon and it expands into the hall with overwhelming impact. The phrase ""And it threw us into the flames"" is simply magical; the ending, repeated runs to ""Let it burn"" indeed do burn with refulgent intensity (watch her face as she ends the song: she's living the emotion).

Adele wisely ends the concert with her monster-mega hit ""Rolling In The Deep,"" which rouses the audience, as she often turns the microphone to them to sing along - which they do, perfectly in tune and on the beat. There is such a sense of occasion here, of pure, exalting joy, of glowing warmth and high spirits, you may find yourself clapping and singing along. The good time and happiness evinced by all signals Adele's heart-capture of her public; her legend is sealed.

Thank you, Adele, for bringing great music to us all.",1335571200,4,4392,4.885752688172043

4904948,4,B005Y423ZC,"We don't realize it, but everything we see, touch, and hear; we criticize. We all have a certain criteria in our heads telling us what we think of something. When it comes to watching a concert on DVD, there are things we all want to see. The singer should have good eye contact and body language with the audience. Don't want the singer looking and giving off bad vibes. Also they shouldn't just sing the entire time. Yes, that's what they are there for and what you paid for, but there should be some interaction with the crowd, and having the singer trying to make some jokes, if possible. Lastly, the performance should be worth it, not something you feel like walking out on. Adele Live at the Royal Albert Hall is an amazing concert DVD.
 She is constantly looking at the crowd. There isn't one moment when she is looking down or away. Even to the people who were on the balcony, she would look and wave so happily. Constantly seeing her emotions and seeing how she was really feeling. Whether she said how she was feeling or not, you could see it all in her body. Pure happiness and adrenaline in her body and voice, but still presented herself so amazingly.
 In the beginning of Adele's show, she came out and instantly sang, but every two to three songs, she would stop, and just talk and laugh with the crowd. Cracking jokes and explaining her songs. Cameron Adams and Allison Stewart agreed about how talkative and loveable Adele really is. She explains where almost every song came from and how she felt about it. Adele said in the DVD that she doesn't really know how she's feeling until she listens to her songs. The jokes she made were just utterly great. In many parts she is dropping F bombs and saying she wasn't the complete victim, but rather a B. Cameron Adams said in an article that she is quite the potty mouth. If you watch the DVD you will truly see that. However, it's also what made her so funny with the way she talked and that she was completely herself. I feel it really makes everyone feel better when they can all laugh and talk together. Barry Walters also comments in his articles about her jokes.
 Of course though, we have finally made it to the last thing....HER PERFORMACE!! We all don't want to spend money on something we don't like, end up not liking, etc. This DVD was definitely worth spending money on. The power behind her voice is tremendous. People and Rolling Stone have especially ranted and raved about how her voice sounds, even in person. Many amateur reviewers agreed as well. Her singing and overall performance is great. You don't really get any better than her voice. She started a few songs over as well, because she didn't like the way it sounded. She actually made the effort to improve her voice in front of a live audience.
 This concert DVD meets these three for sure requirements I have, plus many more. Completely astounded and taken away with her performance in this show. I couldn't have spent my money on anything better. Definitely recommending this not just to Adele fans, but to someone who is trying to experience or watch something new. You won't regret buying the DVD. It really is great, even from anyone's overall standards.",1333929600,,3200,4.569686411149826

Her studio work is great on its own, but seeing the live performance with how she presents her vocal talents and delivery with such ease, to me, is astounding.  If you have a passion for music, and enjoy the melodic union of vocals and instrumentation, you will NOT be disappointed with this DVD.  She is a grounded and inspired soul, who happens to have a very sassy way about her.  She engages with fans and has a wicked sense of humor, which makes her even that much more enjoyable to watch.  I can't wait to see her live some day myself because this woman was born to sing.  Enjoy.  I did.  Very much so!",1333756800,,783,4.4125874125874125

I was in Best Buy and wandered into the high end speaker room where they were playing this outstanding DVD.  Sure, I saw her win a lot of awards, but I never really ""heard"" or paid any attention to her.

The sound was great, of course, but what hooked me was the magnificent video production that pays her outstanding voice a wonderful compliment.  This was five days ago.  I can't stop watching the blue ray and I have the CD in the car which I downloaded to my iPhone so I literally listen to Adele every chance I get.  The salesman told me that he has sold more speakers because of the Blue Ray.  He almost got me, too.

Ok, she curses, she uses an obscene gesture and tells off color stories - And?!

She's authentic, talented, funny, very disarming.  I tell everyone I discovered her this weekend much the way Columbus discovered America.  I am sorry I had not heard of her earlier, perhaps I would have enjoyed the Grammy's more!",1333584000,,1122,4.424390243902439

He continually jumps from camera to camera, every few seconds. I buy a DVD because it gives you a front row seat, but not here. You will find yourself watching the concert from all over the arena, including lots of views of her backside, from the side and every instrumentalist au nausea. Its as if the director thinks we will forget where the concert is if he doesn't continually show the concert hall from every imaginable direction. A lot of out of focus shots. I would suggest you buy the cd or listen to the DVD with the television picture off. We buy the concert to see what the audience sees. The audience got to see more of Adele than we did.

As one reviewer (Kit) wrote ""...the director used every trick in the book"". And he used it over and over again! Out-of-focus to focused, and back out again, quick cutting, panning, zooming, over and over. It never stopped. If the songs were uptempo, the editing / cutting got more frenetic.
The longest held shot was for about 2 seconds on her face... maybe. It was terrible, and a repulsive disservice to Adele who deserves better... much better.

How does viewing a blurry ceiling lighting fixture enhance my 'concert experience'? I bought this so that I could see an Adele performance, not a director's performance. Why only show Adele one out of 20 shots? The credits show a list of maybe 20 camera operators. They needed 3, and one should have stayed fixed, and on Adele, full body shot, the entire time.

This 'director' and 'producer' should be sent to prison for this crime.

The problem is that the director kept calling attention to himself instead of Adele. I bought this to see Adele, not the director.

Adele, Darling, please get yourself some competent people behind you, not a bunch of imature, amateur MTV hacks with ADHD. You deserve much better.

All that aside, the sound is very good. DTS-HD Master. Beautiful. So close your eyes and listen. She's a wonderful, heartfelt performer and the video is appauling.",1332115200,53,1496,4.694656488549619

I love the pans to the audience, thins, fats, LOTS of women and the men who reluctantly(?) accompanied the womenfolks. Buy his DVD for the show, the personality, the chats.

Seriously, some of those songs gave me chills.  I can see why more than a few people wept, her voice is that beautiful, and so full of emotion.

I ripped the CD into mp3 (high quality, 256+), and if it was possible to ""wear out"" an mp3 file, I would have done it.  Here story-telling on the DVD is great.  It's like she had 5,000 of her closest friends over to her flat for a private show.  I do agree with other reviewers that warn about letting your children watch the DVD, she does swear like a truck driver when she gets going.  However, unless your kids have never left the house or have virgin-white ears, it's not like they've never heard an f-bomb dropped before watching this show.

I enjoyed the covers she did too, as a little something new and different.

As far as the CD goes, the applause is there but I didn't find it distracting in the least. They edited out pretty much all the talking, so there's no cussing on the CD and she is just as good live as on her albums. I definitely recommend this for any Adele fan!",1331251200,,791,4.123376623376624
4905021,5,B005Y423ZC,"If you are an Adele fan or want to check out a spectacular voice,check out this DVD.When listening to her sing you get drawn in to her passion and emotion. She sings every song with feeling and emotion. Aside from her big hits Chasing Pavements,Someone Like You,and Rolling in the Deep,her connection with the audience is extraordinary! Adele at one point breaks down when she hears the audience singing back to her. She is an unbelievable performer and a true Human Being. Listen for yourself. AWESOME!",1331251200,,503,4.8604651162790695
4905022,5,B005Y423ZC,"This is one of those occasions when you buy something that you hope will be as good as the reviews indicate and you receive something that is even better than you thought.  It's a concert that is simply breathtaking. One of the other reviewers thought that Adele's voice wasn't the best; there is a whole Albert Hall that would question that!  It is a blissful performance by someone who deservedly has earned the title 'Star'.  She stands on the stage sharing her thoughts and feelings with us in a frank and occasionally blunt manner, which is admirable in its openness and then she performs in such a way that we forget that this is a live, unadulterated performance.  We end up  wishing we were there but we are even more grateful that this allows us to share the event.  It is one of those 'memorable' events.  As for the encore...................................!!!!!",1331078400,,873,4.78

The voice this woman has is amazing, and to listen to her talk to the crowd between songs is funny, although she's got a bit of a potty mouth, so if you're getting this for a younger family member, you might want to get the edited version.",1330992000,,279,4.090909090909091
4905024,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is so wonderful and beautiful and talented and...I could go on and on.  This blu-ray DVD brings her soul and passion and humor into your living room with such clarity and perfection - I'm definitely a big fan of Blu-Ray now, but I digress.  Adele is so very funny.  She'll have you laughing one moment and crying the next.  Her emotion is so raw and she just puts it all out there on the table.  There's nothing fake about her and she deserves all the success that has come her way and I know that things will just continue to be awesome for her!  When my wife first heard her song ""Chasing Pavements"" she said to me, ""Wow, she's gonna be a huge success, just watch.""  I was a bit skeptical but she was absolutely correct in her prediction.  I really hope she tours the U.S. soon.  To see her LIVE in person would no doubt be the most awesome experience - next to seeing Wicked (which we've seen twice).  :-)  If you are having any doubts at all about purchasing this DVD - rest assured, you will NOT be disappointed.  I was sad when it was over.",1330992000,,1052,4.231155778894473

I understand some people were put off by swearing in between songs, but it was not inappropriate to me. Adele reminds me of a Liza Dolittle to hear her speak and then hear her sing the songs is all the more stunning.",1330732800,,368,4.507462686567164

I think one of the reviews I read before purchasing complained STRONGLY that the quick editing cuts were annoying to the point of ruining the concert experience.  I was worried about this but purchased anyway.  I don't think the complaint is justified.  That reviewer needs to relax a little.  Sound quality is excellent. My only regret is not buying the blu ray version (and I blame the above mentioned reviewer for my decision to save a few bucks for fear of not liking all the ""rapid cuts"" and other negative comments.

4905031,3,B005Y423ZC,"I bought this set unseen and immediately popped the DVD into the player as I worked and loved it!

Then I looked at the Bluray and saw an ""Advisory"" sticker and did a quick search online and found out about the foul language inbetween the songs during the concert. Due to that, I have yet to watch it and doubt I will ever give it a spin.

The DVD alone was worth the $10 I paid for it.

4905032,5,B005Y423ZC,"So many great reviews here so I won't repeat all that, ditto to it all!  I'll just add that Adele is such a true and natural talent, the likes of which we haven't seen for a long time.  She needs no gimmicks, only her beautiful and emotional voice, a microphone, and her songs.  I love her down-to-earth, honest personality, and her audience identifies with that.  There is no pretense, and she doesn't copy anyone else either in song or in how she dresses.  She doesn't aspire to be a ""skinny-mini"" as she puts it.  She is so completely refreshing as an artist, and these are among the many reasons her fans simply adore her, me included.  But above all, it's about that glorious voice!  While Adele doesn't sound at all like the late Eva Cassidy, she is the first singer since Eva to pack so much beauty and raw emotion into her interpretation of a song, and she makes us feel that raw emotion.  This concert DVD is wonderful and I certainly wouldn't nit-pick with any of the production values.  I was mesmerized beginning to end and saw nothing to really criticize in that regard.  This concert is a complete treat and an absolute must-have for any fan of Adele.",1330128000,,1165,4.5
4905033,5,B005Y423ZC,"Buy this video!  Her performance a Albert Hall, prior to surgery, is very powerful & as she talks with the audience you get a small picture of who she is.  I seriously suggest you buy it.",1330128000,,187,4.166666666666667

If she spoke appropriately on the DVD I would recommend the DVD to the world.  As it is, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Luckily the CD only has the music.  5 stars on the CD.",1329955200,3,346,4.2

4905037,5,B005Y423ZC,"I heard first heard and saw Adele on a ""Graham Norton Show"" broadcast and decided I had to buy her album ""21.""  Liked it, but found this CD/DVD combo about a month later and went for it.  I am so-o-o glad that I did.  The additional cover songs are great and Adele's warm, bubbly personality comes shining through on the DVD.  Although her voice is not at its best, it's live and I don't expect live performances to match the vocal perfection she could have in a studio version of the songs.  But, with her providing narration on the background of creating her songs and choosing others' songs to cover, this DVD concert is a real treat.  Adele wakes me up on my clock radio (this version) and she seranades me everyday in my car, when I'm not pausing the telly every now and then to watch a song or two from this DVD.  Perfection as entertainment.  I am a sucker for singers like Westlife and Adele who don't need gimmicks, just their voices, to serenade and satisfy.

Brava, Adele!",1329868800,,983,4.416666666666667

On the DVD Adele is charming and funny and the best singer I've ever seen. What I wouldn't give to see her perform live. Until then I'll just keep watching this DVD. Until I have to order another one because I've worn this one out. Highly highly recommend.",1329696000,,424,4.246913580246914
4905040,5,B005Y423ZC,"Ignore those who say it's horrible filming and editing. Nothing could be further from the truth. It makes you feel like you're really there. And yes she does say the 'F' word a lot, but it's not like you're going to have small children watching with you. Now that she's won several Grammy's I don't see this dvd as keeping the price low. I'm so happy I bought it when I did. It will be something I watch over and over!",1329609600,,418,4.172839506172839

4905042,3,B005Y423ZC,"Here, I'm not really rating Adele's performance or operator's work etc. I'm rather rating the media and its producers. I had to return the first DVD I got, after seeing it not working on 4 different devices - a DVD player, and DVD drives in 3 computers (2 PCs and 1 Mac).

I looked at the surface and I saw some defect there, like internal crack rather than surface scratch. A-ha! I said to myself, and returned it for replacement, to great disappointment of my daughter for whom I bought it.

The second disk I got, before trying, I examined the surface under light, and it looked perfect. So I confidently summoned my daughter for the presentation. Only to see the disk performing the same, being completely unrecognized on some devices and having other ones hang. Can't even describe expression on my daughter's face.

So I got suspicious at that point. I thought: maybe it's simply so over-protected, the older devices can't tolerate it? (The youngest device I tried is almost 2 years old).

To check the theory, I had to hack the disk's protection, and guess what, it worked. What's so ironic here is... I remember, couple decades ago, I had to hack a disk to make a copy for myself because I couldn't afford to buy it but wanted it so badly it hurt. Now all of a sudden I'm forced to do this to a disk I've purchased for its full price; I have to hack it so my daughter can see it. Kids, don't ever be pirates, you'll bring a curse upon yourselves.

Still giving it 3 stars, because after all, the contents itself is high quality as soon as you can get to it. Just beware, you better have a recent player to deal with it.
Am going to upgrade mine and see if the over-protection is not a problem even for newer ones...",1329609600,,1723,4.38871473354232
4905043,5,B005Y423ZC,Loved every minute of it. Wish the cd was the exact repuca of the DVD version though! But that's ok.... Can make my own copy if need be!,1329523200,,136,3.892857142857143
4905044,5,B005Y423ZC,"She talks about some of the songs before she sings it. That makes the whole performance that much more intimate, especially with her personality.

Concert video suppose to bring that in-concert experience into the living room. The director seems to have ADD and it shows in this presentation. He jumps from one camera to another during the performance. The cut scene works great if it is done right; that is the cut scene syncs with the emotions and energy of artist and audience. But each of his cut scene doesn't last more than 10 seconds, and it's all random scenes that do not sync with the song's rhythm. It is a visual interruption than anything else. But at the same time, it's a true testament of Adele's voice; which overpowers the visual interruption and brings you right back into the concert.

Despite the visual shortcoming mentioned above, watching this blu-ray on a HDTV (1080i)with 5.1 speaker system (DTS) is breathe taking. I highly recommend it, even if you already own her mp3 from the major online distributors like iTunes and Amazon Music. Those mp3 are compressed and can't do justice for Adele's voice.",1329523200,2,1126,4.829015544041451
4905045,5,B005Y423ZC,"If you are a fan of Adele this is a must to add to your Adele collection. She is so real and down to earth and somehow makes you feel like you are there and having a conversation with a girlfriend. Of course it does not beat being able to actually be there, but this is the next best thing. I have been playing this dvd over and over for weeks and it has a cd with the live recording of this concert as well. Great buy!",1329523200,,419,3.8275862068965516

BUY THIS ONE...YOU WILL PLAY IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!,1329436800,,368,4.271428571428571

Unlike my husband and children, I am not a big music person but I have been wanting to get a CD by Adele and I am so glad I got the CD/DVD. Her voice is so beautiful and even with all her success she has had over the last year, she is a very down to earth person. Adele is a beautiful person inside and out. I love how she tells a story with so many of her songs and makes them even more personal then before. This has to be the best thing I have purchased in a long, long time and considering I love my purses, that is saying something, believe me.",1329350400,,652,3.801470588235294
4905048,5,B005Y423ZC,"This 2011 performance at The Royal Albert Hall in London was beautifully captured for Blu-ray/DVD. Adele's performance is about as close to perfection as you can get, and the visual HD quality is stunning. Add to that a fantasic sound mix, perfectly produced in 5.1. So many musical artists fail to capture those early magical tours for posterity, and it is nice to see that years from now this performance can be enjoyed over and over again.

I was especially pleased with the ""extra"" feature on the disc, a short behind the scenes video that compresses Adele's whole day from morning tea to walking onstage... into about eight minutes. Much longer and it would have begun to bore, much shorter and it would have felt like a teaser... well edited! A nice little easter egg in this short is seeing Adele posing for a photo with The Civil Wars, who were her opening act for this and several other concerts.",1329350400,,905,4.65625
4905049,5,B005Y423ZC,This is one of the most incredible live performance videos I have ever seen. It is very evident that there is a very good chemistry between the audience and Adele. Maybe she uses some bad language between the songs but the audience loves it and when she starts singing you forget all about that. The sound and image quality is excellent and the cutting of the video gives a good feeling of what it must have been like to be there. I'm sure that we will get to hear a lot more from Adele and I really hope to get a chance so watch her live.,1329264000,,539,4.09433962264151

ALL and MORE than one could ask for from an artist. She shows her emotions when she is moved to do so, interacts with audience, tells how she came to write the songs, and on top of all of that she is such a ""cut-up"". IF this music doesn't make you FEEL emotions to your toes you should find the nearest morgue and check yourself in. ABSOLUTELY THE BEST WAY TO SELL A PRODUCT - I can choose to watch and listen or to just listen. I'll take Adele any way that I can hear the music.",1328918400,,638,4.071428571428571

On the exceptional set, Adele proves that she's more than a `studio' vocalist, lending her powerful pipes to this fine compilation recorded in 2011.  While most of the arrangements maintain their `sanctity' in accordance with their studio counterparts, the effects are not boring, but rather just a solid, live version. There are few quibbles making Live a solid addition to any hardcore Adele fan's library.

""Hometown Glory"" opens the effort with a few changes, namely a mysterious ostinato to open the cut.  The dramatic use of the lower register of the piano is a nice touch and finally the cut settles into the piano-driven hit from 19.  The pitch by Adele is nearly perfect and proves to be a solid way to open the set. ""I'll Be Waiting"" follows, exhibiting top-notch mixing given the live-sound.  The supporting background vocals on the refrain sound particularly strong here. ""Don't You Remember"" keeps up the momentum, doing a fine job of preserving the original arrangement.  Adele's vocal performance is solid and dramatic by all means with no qualms to speak of.

""Turning Tables"" begins ever so slightly slower than the studio recording, but still preserves most of the nuances and vocal affections of the original.  The original does eclipse this live take, but ""Turning Tables"" sounds very solid live. ""Set Fire to the Rain"" is a better performance, with highly assertive lead vocals by Adele.  The producers have done a fabulous job of ensuring that Adele's lead vocals are highly present within the mix.  The grit achieved is marvelous to say the least.  ""If It Hadn't Been For Love"" is a nice cover performance, adding something different for listeners.  ""My Same"" is captivating as well, with Adele doing a fantastic job of presenting the jazz idiom.

""Take It All"" preserves the original performance, though the background vocals absence are a slight quibble; they would've taken ""Take It All"" live over the top. ""Rumour Has It"" is well executed as far as maintaining the arrangement and personnel.  ""Right As Rain"" does a fine job of preserving the arrangement and breaking up lengthier songs.  ""One and Only"" is perfect, achieving a sound mix and pure, capable vocals by Adele.  As great as the interpretation of ""One and Only"" is, adding some horns would've made the cut truly cutting edge and `killer.'  If there was one other quibble musically, it might be that at the end the background vocals from the choir fade out - an issue that also occurred with the original. Imagine the added power with retaining the choral vocals.  Regardless, ""One and Only"" is a brilliant performance.

""Lovesong"" is fine, proving no more or less exciting than the studio version.  The only quibble might be that ""One and Only"" and ""Lovesong"" could have been spaced out considering their consummate length, however, they fall the same way on 21. ""Chasing Pavements""  is solid, though a slightly less refined performance than the studio version.  ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" is a superb performance and perfect choice of song for Adele to cover.  ""Make You Feel My Love"" is also a solid Bob Dylan cover, keeping the momentum of the live set lofty.  ""Someone Like You"" and ""Rolling in the Deep"" close the effort particularly soundly, as expected.  ""Someone Like You"" is the better performance of the two, but ""Rolling in the Deep"" is none too shabby itself.

I know she is nominated for 6 possble Grammys. I hope she gets them all. Others that are nominated but they don't really sing they are there for the stupid getups

She is such a FANTASTIC singer, her orchestra, band, back up singers the whole show is wonderful. She's irreverant, funny, and classy.
Incredibly moving, several songs made me tear up and then the last song, Someone Like You, when the entire Royal Albert Hall sings along, AHH and WOW!! Major tears!

I did a double take when Adele appeared. It was hard to believe that this matronly figure is in her early twenties. Adele resembled a frumpy forty something.

Don't get me wrong, there are some decent songs. But on the whole this concert reminds me of those singers who talk a lot to fill up a show. My eyes wandered from the TV screen during her nasal banter. Her inane cackle was absolutely grating and at one point I wished she would just shut up and do her songs.

The audio disk was a lot better as it cuts out 30 minutes of sometimes littered with obscenities irritating chatter, thus allowing you to focus on and appreciate her music.

This DVD was heavily advertised on TV and aggressively pushed by the shops. One chain overstocked and slashed prices, so curiosity prompted me to get a copy.

Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall was just passable for me. I won't pick adjectives like brilliant or fantastic. This one is strictly for hardcore fans. Casual listeners can give this a miss. I foresee this item going to the used DVD store soon.",1327968000,4,1323,4.588983050847458

A MASTERPIECE OF BEAUTIFUL PERFECTION!

-----

I do have to agree that -in my humble opinion- the video editing was, for lack of a better word, crappy at times.  This was most obvious with the faster songs (which unfortunately included my favorite ""Set Fire To The Rain"") ---> [...]

What I want to see is Adele's every expression and feeling as she sings her songs.  A shot of the audience or the orchestra/backup singers here and there is perfectly fine... Instead, I got dizzy and headachy watching the screen pan from shot to shot (most not even of her!) with every note.  Did NOT like that at all.

But, IMHO, this DVD still deserves 5 stars because... come on, it's Adele!  A true real and amazing talent in a world of fake pop ""talent"".  It is a joy to watch her and listen to her when she talks (potty mouth and all!), sings, laughs... and cries.",1327536000,,864,4.4113924050632916

But it is Adele, and I adore her, so I wanted to really give it a shot. and boy! Was I pleasantly suprised!!! The sound quality is amazing! She is spectacular, as always! The Shouts and screams of the crowd really are left to a minimum being only at the beginning and end of the song, unless she talks to them, or they sing for her. Really, Really great album!",1327276800,,483,3.9896907216494846

4905087,4,B005Y423ZC,"I'm new to Adele and her music. Picked up this disc for it's production and audio quality. I would have to say after watching this from beginning to end I am now a fan. Adele has some ""pipes"". She can sing and her delivery is full of emotion and power. The bluray is well mixed. A truly entertaining concert. Demo material on a good sound system. If you're an Adele fan or just looking for something to show off your audio/video system this disc is a must buy. I'm looking forward to her upcoming releases.",1327190400,,506,4.336842105263158

No changing clothes every ten minutes, a lot of fun chatter with a few f-bombs thrown in for good measure and you've got yourself an evening of entertainment you'll want to see over and over again. A CD comes with the DVD and it's in my car for listening to over and over again. If you like Adele, and I can't imagine anyone not liking her, you'll love this flawless live performance. She blasts the roof off the Royal Albert Hall.",1327190400,,518,4.295918367346939

All I can say, if you like Adele and who doesn't?  Get this DVD, then you will love her even more!!!  I just hope she doesn't burn her candle out too soon.  She is a young lady who has soooo much talent and deserves a long healthy life.",1327190400,,495,4.147368421052631
4905090,1,B005Y423ZC,"I bought the DVD/CD pack as I love just about all of her songs on her 21 album. When I purchased the album, I did not think or even believe that I would be presented with so much trash talking from her.  Whoever decided to produce this concert and publish it needs to be fired!  My copy is going exactly where it belongs - in the trash.  I am a Brit., and I am totally ashamed of her representation of a Brit.  I love her music and her message, but I will never have the same feelings when I listen to her songs again as her image(for me) as been spoiled.  Do not buy the DVD if you have teenagers or younger children.",1327190400,12,618,3.991869918699187

Don't worry about the quality of singing, as one reviewer mentioned, it does not spoil the enjoyment of the whole even a little. This is not a studio album after all! The CD is great; it cuts out all the 'chat' and applause and concentrates on the music. A perfect combination.",1327190400,,455,4.364705882352941

Adele, you owned your audience. I am from South Africa and I ordered this dvd set from the USA via Germany to South Africa, and it cost 3 times more than the initial purchase price - but it was worth every effort and every penny.

You had us in tears, and moments thereafter, we were all laughing.

You set a new international standard not only with your music, but with your mind-blowing stage personality. It felt like knowing you personally.

I will get a plane ticket and head down to the uk or even the US later this year, to see you live.

Gosh - this is the best purchase I have ever made.

4905100,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is a wonderful old soul in a young, fresh and funny present incarnation, wise beyond her years with a charming, wry sense of humor... As much as she seems bemused and amazed at actually being at the Royal Albert Hall, she commands the stage perfectly, as as a consummate professional. Perfectionist that she is, at one point she even corrects herself by restarting a song which did not even sound off to begin with, because she felt she did not sound good enough. Adele seems to expect nothing but the best from herself, and she delivers in every way possible. She has a very infectious way about her on stage and her banter between songs is as entertaining as the songs themselves, making it very easy to enjoy every minute of this fabulous performance. Highly recommended... Fans will adore it and those yet to be swayed will indeed be swayed.",1326758400,,851,4.642384105960265

4905103,5,B005Y423ZC,"I first saw Adele on SNL and she sang Turning Tables. I knew a star had been born. Today she sings from the heart to her audience, bares her soul and holds nothing back. She makes you cry and laugh and feels emotions. I love it that she writes her own music from her life stories; and she shares her self. Blu Ray is also the only way to watch her dynamo personality. The audience, too.",1326758400,,386,4.092105263157895

4905105,5,B005Y423ZC,"I've gotten to know Adele's music only recently. Mainly because of a few songs that have been playing non-stop on the radio, Apple sampled ""Rolling In The Deep"" for the iPhone 4s launch and more importantly that my co-worker sings her songs every day and they got stuck in my head. I figured, why not get to know Adele and her music by watching her live performances. Hence, I bought the Blu-ray. And it was one of the smarter things I have done in my life.

Artist-wise, I believe that Adele is a humble and talented person. I love her music and everything about her. You can really relate to her and her songs.

As for the concert performance, it was an awesome experience. I enjoyed every second of her performance. I am sort of an audiophile and in my opinion, the audio was clean and video was sharp. We have a pretty good 7.1 setup at home and a large screen to watch it in. The recording was top-notch and I do not regret buying this blu-ray.

Keep rockin' Adele!",1326585600,,970,4.348066298342541

4905108,5,B005Y423ZC,"This package is winner if you are an Adele fan!  Clearly this lady is one of the BEST things to come along musically for some time.  Please be aware that she not only sings like a hot, bluesy banshee, she also WRITES a great deal of the best material she's recorded.  She's a force to be reckoned with, and will hopefully be with us for a LONG time!

I was really excited when I purchase the Albert Hall package, very eager to to WATCH this terrifically down-to-earth performer do her magic at a concert that was HUGE for her and with an audience filled with her friends as well as fans BUT...

Unbeknownst to me, there is AN EDITED FOR MATURE LANGUAGE VERSION OF THIS CONCERT!!!  The notation to that effect on the box, is A SMALL LABEL WITH BLACK LETTERING PASTED OVER A BLACK BACKGROUND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK OF THE JEWEL CASE... so it is practically invisible!!  I was REALLY IRKED by this and wanted ALL of Adele, not some cleaned up version!!  SO BEWARE... If clean is what you want, just keep your eye out for that tiny black label... If not....WATCH OUT and be sure you buy what you wanted!

The concert CD and DVD is FANTASTIC, and worth every cent and more of what you will pay for it!!

Can't wait for more from Adele... She's a true gift to music lovers!",1326499200,,1270,4.2761506276150625

Stick with a shot for a while!  She has slows songs I would imagine would require infrequent edits. But I would be wrong.  Today's media equates a million edits with creativity.  Adele is the show not your stupid edits and camera movement.

Adele is a throwback artist relying on her voice, not heavy instrumentation, dancing/gyration, or flashy dancers.  It's the audience, musicians, and her voice. Let us watch HER and listen to the voice, see her emotions while singing the song, watch the musicians perform their craft. Let us get lost in them and the music.  Instead I got lost in the cutting, panning, zooming, cutting like it's a MTV video for kids!  The first time I watched the DVD it was quite distracting.  The second time through I acquiesced, gave in, and didn't let it bother me. As much!

Watched it with wife the first time, my 17 year-old daughter (BIG Adele fan) the second time. We all thoroughly enjoyed the music. It felt like we had been at a concert. I can live with the f-bombs. She's only 21 and a little bawdy.  But please re-edit the dad gum thing!",1326412800,5,1244,4.579185520361991

I like the fact that she seems to be ""everyday people"" and no airs.  If I could only get exactly what she is saying.

4905122,5,B005Y423ZC,"Simply Blown away by this Blu Ray. Adele clearly has one of the superlative voices on the music scene today.  She expresses emotion exceptionally well, the depth and coloratura of her voice is amazing. The technical sound quality is also wonderful. I found myself adjusting both my Dolby decoder and picture settings to optimize the full experience.

Her betwixt song commentary adds a great deal to the depth of understanding of the emotional source material. It brings out a personal quality that rings strait to the heart true. Yes, there were fracking f bombs dropped, gee they were honest expressions of the wonderment of it all. She is after all a young British subject singing in Royal Albert Hall, one of the finest venues in the world.  It does highlight that there are British American cultural differences, perhaps a class thing too, all a really good thing.

...All that's been said, what I want to strongly defend is the directing and editing.  The production is great.  The short views that are used focus visual interest. The cuts of Royal Albert Hall, the instrumental and vocal accompanists, and the 'posh' crowd, are all wonderful.  Each angle and frame is beautifully shot. I wouldn't want to miss any of it. It takes attention and multiple viewings to take it all in,... again that's a really fantastic thing.

Buy this! ...You simply can't go wrong.",1326153600,2,1370,4.875

I'm not sure the BlueRay version is worth the extra cost, and the director of this in concert show is more in love with camera moves than Adele.

Adele's voice is one of those joyful musical instruments that few are blessed with.  I know that she wasn't at her peak, performing, because of medical issues, but, you'd never know it, to listen to her.  She had me singing along, as she also had the audience.  Her infectious giggle warmed me.
The DVD is a separate joy.  Live performances are rarely the same on a disc as in person.  But, you'll have a great seat with this one.
I hope one day to hear her perform in person.",1325894400,,637,4.007936507936508

I have to admit I was not an Adele fan before and I bought this disc more for the hype surrounding her chart topping songs. But boy, am I glad I did. To say I was blown away is an understatement; I felt like I was there among the audience at the Royal Albert cheering her on, finding myself totally drawn in by her powerful voice and I also felt an emotional connection. There are so many songs in the disc that appeals to me like I'll Be Waiting, Set Fire To The Rain (and I haven't heard those songs before this) but the icing on the cake got to be the last two numbers - Someone Like You and Rolling In The Deep. This blu-ray is worth every dime just for those songs and as a bonus, you even get a CD of the songs to play in your car. And how can you improve on such an awesome performance? By producing a 3D version and the option of having the lyrics on the screen.",1325721600,,1042,3.919811320754717
4905137,5,B005Y423ZC,"All the other reviews are absolutely correct.
-The video annoyingly stays on everyone else more than her. I like her because it feels like she's sitting across from me on the couch comparing old lovers but I don't care about the random concertgoers. Even the behind the scenes video is mostly other people talking about the concert.
-She does use salty language that you might not want your children to hear. But, we love that she's a real person with real feelings that are quite familiar and that's who she is. It's not as bad as some of the other reviews have said and I would just explain it to kids. Don't let the language keep you from the experience.
-She is awesome. The chatting makes it 100 times better than just listening to the songs. You can hear her passion for her music and her true love of her audience. The singing is amazing and she chose a great selection for the concert.
I loved it. You need it!",1325721600,,918,4.405882352941177

When it was over, I was so bummed that I wouldn't be able to have the same experience until she toured again. Luckily, they made this DVD and watching this is like being right back at the concert. It's an exact replica of what it would be like to be in the audience. So whether you have been lucky enough to go to one of her concerts already and want to relive the experience, or you want to see what one of her concerts would be like, this is the perfect DVD for you!",1325721600,,592,4.068376068376068

4905143,5,B005Y423ZC,This was a excellent dvd. It was like a VH1 Storytellers episode where she gets to tell stories about how she wrote these songs of 21 album and more interesting facts about her inspirations. This is a great taping of a live concert in her home country and is well worth the small price for DVD and CD set. There is even extra behind scenes documentary.,1325548800,,352,4.348484848484849

4905150,5,B005Y423ZC,"This concert was amazing and I would highly recommend it. Adele mentioned she was recovering from a respiratory infection but her performance was one to remember. There were just a few times when she might not have hit a note as high as she would have liked but it didn't matter, it was still extraordinary. Playing Royal Albert Hall was her dream come true and it was such an emotion night for her and that came through in the music. Can't wait to see what her next project will be. At 23, let's hope she has many more dreams come true in her music.",1325376000,,550,4.298076923076923

She sings 21 completely, plus some very excellent covers, along with 1 or 2 songs from 19. Some people did not like the editing of the concert, but I thought it was appropriate to the setting and very professionally done. It did not have the badly done ""jump"" cuts that you see in some concert films.
Adele comes across as a real person, warts and all. I can recommend this DVD or Blu-Ray without reservation. She does use some foul language, so if that's a problem, get the edited version of the same concert.",1325376000,,603,4.441441441441442
4905154,5,B005Y423ZC,"Got this as a Christmas present, and I have not taken it out of the CD player yet... She sounds amazing, as always, and moved me to tears at several points of the recording. Maybe she doesn't sound as ""perfect"" as listeners are used to from hearing studio versions, but reviewers saying she didn't sound ""right"" baffle me. This is a live performance, and any singer/band performing live will have moments of imperfection. Can you hear a little catch in her voice now and then? Yes. Does it detract from the smoky, sexy fullness and power of her voice? Not in the least. This is an emotional performance for her and it shows. She doesn't miss a note, and she looks incredible. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it!",1325376000,,699,4.46875
4905155,5,B005Y423ZC,Adele chooses an interesting collection of music for this venue that makes it all her sound. Truly one of the great vocal artist of this time she is totally at ease with her audiance.,1325376000,,183,4.411764705882353
4905156,3,B005Y423ZC,"Obviously I am missing something.  Adele is universally loved.  Just read all the five star reviews. That's why we bought the concert. I agree with some of the technical critcisms of the blu ray disc, but they didn't bother me too much.
I find most of her songs boring, with most sounding to me like the previous one.  Her voice is powerful even though at this concert it was obvious she wasn't 100%. Her between song patter was also very difficult for me to understand.  She does not speak a sophisticated English, and the between song patter is like the disclaimers you hear at the end of a radio ad.  You know, motor mouth. She can be funny when you can understand it.

It would have helped greatly if there were subtitles to turn on.  That way you could get familiar with the song lyrics easier and understand the patter.

One last thing.  Her voice was so over amplified with an annoying echo to it as well.

I love all kinds of music but I was very disappointed in this performance. I know she has a great voice. I'd love to hear her perform some music outside of whatever this was.

I await my beating!!",1325376000,3,1110,4.365853658536586
4905157,5,B005Y423ZC,"After seeing this DVD, I'm convinced Adele has been Heaven sent! It's like she's the harbinger of all tender souls, singing in a way that purges pent up emotions, leaving behind a glowing feeling that warms you to the marrow. Yes, as some have said, the editing is questionable at times, but the quality (Both sound and picture) is first rate, and anyone that knows anything about ""capturing light"", especially during a concert, will tell you the same. Also, as indicated by others, she does tend to curse, but for me, because of when she chose to do so, it just made me love her even more (She's extremely funny!) The bottom line, there is NO ONE like Adele, never has been, and we'll probably never the likes of her again!",1325376000,,724,4.534351145038168

While the concert as a whole is fantastic, it is worth noting that it was recorded only a week or so before Adele had to cancel the rest of her tour due to vocal problems; her voice sounds less than pristine on a couple of songs, and ""Rumour Has It"" has parts where her voice sounds abrasive. I would recommend this album, but at the same time, I am curious as to how much better it would be if Adele had been completely free of vocal problems and might encourage patient fans to wait a few years and see if she releases another live album (assuming she makes a full recovery from her surgery). The language on the DVD also is pretty filthy, and the video editing can get a bit annoying (the camera angle changes every second or two on some songs).",1325289600,,959,4.245901639344262

Though I'm a lifelong music fan and an older guy, she is an old soul channeling emotions that go
way beyond her 22 years on the planet.
I was thrilled and excited when I saw this DVD was coming out and quickly bought a copy.
Though Adele is incredible, whoever was the director of this abomination should be shot on sight.
Horrible quick edits, ridiculous shots from the top of the Albert Hall behind a hanging lamp, and
too many shots of the audience singing along.
I want Adele just as she is. yes, she just stands there and sings...that's what's so powerful about her.
So why do we need quick edits of boring shots of the drummer? Just give me Adele straight on singing a song with
minimum quick edits and I would be a happy guy.
Buy it if you must (and trust me you must), but be aware that this ADD director pretty much ruins the Adele experience.",1325289600,5,938,4.305084745762712

As I have been unable to obtain tickets to an Adele live show, this was a real treat for me. To see her in the gorgeous Prince Albert Hall, truly in touch with and interacting with the audience was a joy. Adele's heart and emotion shine through in her performance.

4905166,1,B005Y423ZC,"Love Adele, saw her live and thoroughly enjoyed this concert. But I'm disappointed to say I can't recommend the edited version for family viewing.

In addition to her incredible voice and songwriting talents, Adele has an amazing stage presence- one of the best ever. She has the rare ability to connect with her audience and make you feel like it truly is just the two of you, alone, having a chat and some tea in her living room. She connects to the level I've only seen before in a Paul McCartney or Bruce Springsteen.

But regretably, she has a very filthy mouth in person. It's who she is, and part of her background and her very charismatic personality. But as engaging as she is live, I'm really happy we didn't take our two young daughters to her concert. Every other word between songs is an F-bomb, which is fine for adults, but she has a huge cross-generational fan base, and I hope she grows enough to realize that this is in poor taste, not appropriate for her younger fan base, and that she's hurting her career and reputation with such filthy language live.

Bought this edited version DVD for our daughters for Christmas so they could see her as close to live as possible. Sadly, the editing job was very poor, and you could basically still hear every F this and F that. They also didn't blur her hands when she flips off her old boyfriend with both hands before one song about him. In sum, don't buy this if you have kids.

Beyond that problem, the concert is OK but not great. Her voice was noticably ragged. Don't get me wrong. Even damaged, she's still better than 99% of the artists out there today, but she was clearly having troubles by this time, and canceled the rest of her tour a few days later.  We saw her a month earlier in Seattle and her voice was in much better shape then.  The band is very strong, and the sound and production values are high. Worth getting if you haven't seen her live. Just don't watch either the unedited or edited version with your kids!",1325203200,27,1993,4.446575342465754

4905176,3,B005Y423ZC,"Adele was incredible. Her performance shined from the heart. However, I was strongly disappointed by the editing on this DVD. The edititor must have ADD. The camera men kept switching the angle every few seconds. When Adele was singing a memorable part, the camera was focusing on people standing in the audience or some non exciting scene. I was getting dizzy from the switching of the cameras. I still would have bought this DVD, but come on, I bought it to watch Adele not some fat women waving their arms in the audience. All said, Adele rocks!",1324944000,10,548,4.65979381443299

4905178,4,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is a truly phenomenal talent. She is one of the most exiting artists to emerge for a long time.

 Apart from some deficiencies in the quality of the DVD, her use of profanity and the level and tone of her banter detracts from her amazing musical ability.

She is still young and will no doubt realize that her musical appeal transcends age groups and that she has style and charisma.

 She does not need to seek sensation because her music speaks for itself.",1324857600,,464,4.476190476190476
4905179,5,B005Y423ZC,"I got this BLU RAY version as a Christmas gift from my hubby. He knew I liked Adele, and we haven't been to a concert or seen one in years since having two kids.... so he brought the concert to me.  I haven't seen such a great performance since Justin TImberlake Lovestoned.  But golly, This show is captivating from start to finish. After the first few songs, I already began to tear up.  Adele sings with such passion, and you can feel her every pain in her lyrics.

This is a MUST see/own.  I love to just pop it in and listen to her sing while I cook or do housechores.  It is a bit explicit, so not advised around toddlers/or young kids, but since she has a heavy British accent, doesn't seem to sound as bad =).

Great concert, great performer, very charismatic, EXCELLENT live performer.  Get it! watch it! love it!",1324857600,,822,4.326797385620915
4905180,5,B005Y423ZC,"Umm, what's to complain about?

The cinematography and sound are absolutely marvelous.  There were a couple shots that I didn't like though.  The whole concert is shown in 24p.  However, there might be one or two shots where 60i is interweaved.  I loved the B-roll shots as I thought they captured the environment and helped bring you into the concert.  There were also some slow motion shots.  I thought they could have chosen better shots to be slow motion, but the choices were still very cool.  Yeah, there are some grainy shots, but this is okay.

Though the casing doesn't indicate you can hear DTS-HD MA, the disc indeed does have a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track and Dolby Digital 2.0 track.  DTS plays by default for my player as I have a receiver capable of playing this sound format.

The extras on the Blu-ray seem to be mostly shot in 60 frames per second, but some in 24p and some slo-mo.

As for Adele, I have not one complaint - she's outstanding.  She does have a bit of a potty mouth though when she lets go and has fun, but just be advised of this.

There were just a couple things I didn't like about the whole Blu-ray, but other then that, the camera work, cinematography, sound, and obviously Adele make for a great concert experience.

I highly recommend the Blu-ray or DVD.",1324857600,,1286,4.459227467811159
4905181,5,B005Y423ZC,"Like many new Adele fans, we loved a few songs and elected to go the DVD route to check out her performance. Pure and simple, she rocks. Who knew she would be such fun and her interaction with those in the Albert Hall was grand.  This was the timeframe when she had throat problems, wow......no way!  She is great at setting the stage with the story of her life and the interplay with her songwriting.  Many songs may seem deep and sad, but her delivery leaves you speechless.  It is a great DVD/CD and one we will happily watch repeatedly -  not just once and done for this one.  I wish I was there in that huge hall, it had to be amazing. Nice to have a talent that really has the pipes to stand up alone or with an orchestra/band.  Power for days. Loved it.",1324857600,,760,4.164383561643835

4905187,5,B005Y423ZC,"I saw her concert in new york city and i thought she is the best singer in the world right now. Unlike 'american idol' type singers who think screaming and yelling equal to good singing, she has good control and perfect vocal. She can soar high but never overdo it. This is why she has been in player the the past year and more. I wish that they keep the focus on her face and expressions as she sings, because that's all i care. A lot of young people complain that she is boring as hell because she just sits and sing. You know, i want to see her singing live and i don't care about everything else. Ella Fitzgerald is my all time favourite singer .. Adele is probably the second best.",1324684800,,686,4.165413533834586

I have never written a review for anything until now. Adele doesn't sing her songs, she lives them. She is the people's singer. Her songs  inspire and show the raw emotion of a person who has gone through so many changes inner life. From Someone Like You to Fire in the Rain, with the amazing string section, you forget (for a little while) the things that are going through your life.  You become focused on her life, her memories.

My only issue is the video quality could have been better. The crowd shots are quite grainy, not a big deal. The audio is great. I'm happy they decided to release a live dvd of her show considering she had to cancel many of her shows this year. Adele is the truth. This is a must own for any fan.",1324598400,,451,4.078651685393258

Her voice is amazing, and just her alone on stage, without special effects, makes a great concert. The video and sound quality is excellent! I couldn't have asked for anything better :)",1324512000,,329,4.5
4905194,1,B005Y423ZC,"This review is ONLY about the filming of the concert.  Adele sounds amazing, the band rocks, and light show (if I could ever really see it) looks fantastic.

HOWEVER, THE AMATEUR DIRECTING OF THE DVD RUINS ANY HOPE OF ACTUALLY SEEING THE CONCERT. Adele is a wonderful performer, so why would the director (and anyone on her staff who approved this DVD) film more of the back of Adele's head, the audience, a member the band's hands, another audience member, Adele far way from the side, more band's hands, a couple of audience members, a quick face shot of Adele, more audience, more band, more back of her head, a close up of her face, and then end with what..... more audience and band!!!!?  What is wrong with the director to this DVD?

I want to see ADELE sing, not audience members singing with her!  I actually couldn't sit through more than a half hour before all the jump cuts and sweeping shots (THAT, AGAIN, DON'T SHOW US ADELE) make my stomach upset.  It's ok to sit the camera down and just film a performer, but somehow no one trusts Adele with this task.

If you want to have this as background music, buy it.  But if you want to see the concert that Adele performed... well so do it.  Too bad this horrible director is more interested in showing us EVERYTHING EXCEPT ADELE on this DVD.  I wish I could return this as I am so mad that this is unwatchable. :(",1324512000,38,1372,4.387351778656127

Perfect.",1324512000,,178,4.59375
4905196,5,B005Y423ZC,"The Blu-Ray version of this movie is absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed the singing and Adele talking to the crowd. Now this part is also something that if you have children you need to be completely aware of. This is by no means a clean release. There is quite a bit of foul language in the show. My kids love Adele and were really excited to watch this and within the first 2 minutes of the show Adele shouts out ""Royal F****** Albert Hall"" I was a little bit surprised and began to get a little worried. Now the rest of the show was filled with lots of ""f"" bombs and various other colorful language. My advice to anyone who has bought this or is interested in buying this to watch with their children is to buy the cd/dvd version which has the edited version of the show. Now that being said if you simply must have the Blu-Ray release, you can pick each song individually from the menu to watch it and it will skip all of the talking leading up to the song and you should be able to navigate your way around the cussing. The included cd is clean though so no worries on that front. All in all this is a great release that comes highly recommended but just beware if there are little Adele fans in your home",1324512000,3,1207,4.206896551724138

From the first song until the last where she enjoys teasing her audience about no encore, this is hands down one of the very best DVD/CD's I've ever heard.  Adele has been on top of the charts since she first appeared on the music scene and at 23 years of age, it's amazing to hear how mature her voice has already become.  When she talks to her sold out audience, you can hear the Cockney accent loud and strong but when she sings, it's mesmerizing.  This is an upbeat, excellently produced DVD that you will want to watch over and over again.

There were way too many shots of the audience here when the focus should of been on Adele, and those on stage with her. Nevertheless, this is worth the buy. She does curse quite a bit between songs, but it doesn't bother me, but she does drop a lot of f bombs, so be prepared for that. A lot of artists these days will do their set, won't talk to the audience and just make the experience as impersonal as possible, but Adele makes this a great experience for the audience and for the viewer.

Now the picture quality of the Blu Ray Is also stunning and nothing less than dazzling. The Concert Itself made me fall In love with many other songs I had heard on the CD's but she so much better live , I must say I never seen anyone top the production of the CD live AND Live are never of the quality of the CD.
Well I'm here to tell you she actually better live. And she a little sweetheart live and humble. I guess they like to use the F word a lot In England because she does several times and at The Royal Albert Hall.
Regardless this Concert is worth every penny of $21. In Blu Ray. I bet the sound Is good on the DVD too. Also you get a CD copy of the concert to download Into Intunes or what ever you use.
If you like or love Adele already be prepared to be blown away, seriously!

4905205,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele cancelled 2 of her scheduled appearances in my city due to her highly publicized throat problems and I was dying for this concert DVD to be released. I therefore literally ripped the package open when it arrived in the mail a couple of weeks ago and I was not disappointed. Unlike other concert DVD that are filled with tons of junk and high drama instead of focusing on the artist; this concert DVD focuses on the reason why I purchased this DVD to begin with... The mighty Adele. I felt like I was hanging out with a gal pal as she tells all types of funny, crazy, heartwarming stories about most of her songs and not many artists open up like that. She also does lots of nice things to and with the audience that makes you love her even more. I appreciated the fact that I could get lost in her voice without having the constant reminder that she has background singers. Many of the artists today depend on their background singers as they are not that great but not Adele; she is simply fantastic! Then there is the laugh! oh my gosh! she has this infectious roaring laugh especially when she tells stories to the audience and you want to laugh right along with her. She almost cannot believe that she is actually at the Royal Albert Hall and there is some adult language involved with that. Nothing too drastic, just a few F bombs here and there and I loved it! Her renditions of a few songs are the best I have ever heard and she did those songs justice. She also takes you on a journey behind the scenes, rollers in her hair, no make up, making her morning cup of tea, her sweet little dog and I loved that a lot. I think the best is yet to come from this gifted singer and this concert DVD is one that you will want to watch over and over again without getting sick of it. I also loved the fact that the entire concert is also on a CD which has been blaring my car. This was money well spent. LOVE IT!",1323907200,8,1915,4.220708446866485

I think Adele is AWESOME!! I have her Album 21 and just purchased her dvd/cd for Adele ""Live at Royal Albert Hall."" Let me tell you just watching this video will make you want to get up and dance, sing, laugh and cry. I am so glad this concert was taped. I think these dvds will sell just as many as her new ""21"" albums. She definetly deserves it! I haven't heard of a singer with such an amazing voice in a very long time. She is the first person that I can actually sit down and listen to the entire album without skipping songs that I don't like. She has a wonderful personality that makes you feel like you've known her a long time. If you're not familiar with her music, you need to get this video. I guarantee you'll love it! Adele is a beautiful person inside and out. It shows through her music, laughter, love and the sharing of her inner most self. Thank you Adele!",1323648000,6,1072,4.109523809523809

You will hear many of the favorites from her two album on it along with a cover of the Bonnie Raitt classic, I Can't Make You Love Me. While this is a live album, Adele is still front and center. Aside from audience participation on Rolling in the Deep. If you are a fan of Adele, this is a worthwhile set to pick up.

I personally liked the way it is filmed, not too jumpy and plenty of close shots of Adele. As for the performance, I've seen videos of her on Jools Holland's TV show (on youtube) and in some of those her voice was better than it is during this concert. She was obviously having some voice problems around this time, but overall her voice sounds very good. Adele is a great singer who has a powerful voice and she puts a lot of feeling and style into her vocals. She is also a very good songwriter who manages to connect with her audience. Overall, this is a bright young talent and a good show. She jokes around a lot and tells stories and you can see that she truly respects her fans.  You also get a stereo cd along with the dvd, good value. Adele is a big time star, she is already the top selling female recording artist in history in England and she is only 22 years old.",1323648000,,995,4.123711340206185

Adele is just superb. The song arrangements, with the live orchestra makes her hits sound even better than the original studio versions. This is something I've never thought possible as I have always found concert cds somewhat lacking.

This is a must buy for Christmas as I can guarantee that you will play both the dvd and cd for many years afterwards.

Not only is she beautiful on the outside, but it is obvious that she has a beautiful soul.  Being a writer myself, I know that the two most inspirational feelings in the world are love and heartache.  She has been impacted by them both.

Sadly, the record companies in the United States of America are only interested in pushing and promoting tasteless trash.  Thank God that we have access to great music from afar.  It is sadly lacking from within.

God bless you, Adele.  You are a blessing, a beauty, and a great singer and performer.

I watched your performance four times this weekend, and it is still in my DVD player, ready to watch again.  The CD is in my vehicle.

You are simply amazing!",1323648000,,955,4.508771929824562
4905214,2,B005Y423ZC,"I was hoping that a concert recorded in this decade with the best filming and recording technology would produce a great experience.  I was hoping BLU-RAY would top it off.

Before I roast the producers and editors, I must point out that Adele was absolutely perfect.  Her voice was clear, strong, and full of emotion, conviction, and she sold every song.  After buying the CD and playing it a hundred times, I could not wait to hear her talk during song breaks.  Adele turned out to be the real deal.  She is charming, funny, and thankful for the audience and the opportunity to perform.

The video quality was ""average"" (lighting, clarity, etc).  The sound quality was average as well, lacking dynamic clarity.  The Dolby digital opportunity was missed by the sound engineers and the band sounded muted and mushy at times.  My only solid beef was with the videoghraphy.  The effects they use to dramatize a scene were overused to the level that gave me a headache.  The camera cut to the next camera every 2 to 3 seconds and the fade in and out of focus on top of that ruined it for me.  The contant sweeping pans and zooms were visually painful by the time the second song ended.

I realize watching a great concert with a single fixed camera is boring.  However, the OVER THE TOP constant camera effects were over done.

How can an artist who sings notes that last 10 seconds permit four to five camera changes in one note?  how can a artist who has absolutely awesome phrasing allow the video effects take away from her hard work and talent?  I really contenplated rating this with only one star.",1323561600,15,1601,4.557894736842106
4905215,3,B005Y423ZC,"I agree with everything said. I should of gotten the DVD version instead, it's probably better! In the last quarter of the concert, the angles of the camera get better and improved from previous shots. I own a 47"" LCD 1080p TV with a Sony Ps3 playing the show and the concert image quality is bad, especially when they show the audience shots. I'm also not a fan of widescreen Concerts ( meaning it shows a black line at the bottom and top of the screen, does not fill the screen). Alot of angles are out of focus as well. YOu will see for youself if you decide to purchase this...

As far as the show itself, it's a great concert with Adele's amazing voice being the highlight. She does not need smoke, dancers, or the need to be showing SKIN to put on a great show. And the bad language she uses should of been kept to a minimum.

If you want to see an amazing BLU RAY concert check out- Michael Jackson's this is it or Celine Dion through the eyes of the world or Thalia en primera Fila :)",1323475200,8,992,4.161458333333333

After watching this dvd just once, I can tell you it is easily in my top five concert dvd's! It usually takes me a few times of watching a dvd concert to really start appreciating it. Not with this one! Adele connects with her audience at a level that is very rare in big concert venues. She takes the time to explain the motivation behind the lyrics. This insight into her music brought me to a whole new level of listening enjoyment. I was certainly taken back at first by her use of the ""F"" word, but by mid concert it didn't bother me at all. The sound quality was excellent! I watched this with my wife and we both had tears running down our face by the end of it. The emotion in this concert is like none other. Adele's voice is incredible!

I picked up the Blu-ray as a surprise for the family, thinking if it was good I might buy a copy as a Christmas gift, etc. Adele is an extremely talented singer, a gifted writer, and seems very down to earth. But why the language? Given the venue, her elegant dress and material, what's with ""****ING ROYAL ALBERT HALL,"" and everything else that follows in her between song chats with the audience? And it's a shame, because she's a fine storyteller. Anyway, the Blu-Ray is labelled as ""EXPLICT CONTENT"" and rightly so.

Audio is very good; visuals are good but too many cuts for my taste, but overall very enjoyable, except for the language.",1323216000,22,658,4.663793103448276

One word of caution though, she does use the f-word quite a bit on the BluRay disc (it is not used on the CD, althought she does not use it in a nasty way, like many performers do.  In any case, because of this issue,it may not be appropriate for households that have young children.

4905225,5,B005Y423ZC,"Judging from this concert, I am not sure if Adele is missing any ingredient that makes a great pop star.  I had 3 generations present to watch this concert and everyone enjoyed it (ages:15-85).  We kept wondering:  Really she is only 21 and so poised and gifted?
1.  She is very likeable and talks to audience as they are long lost friends that she has reconnected with.  Very cute and bubbly which was a shock considering the serious relationship topics she sings about.
2.  A voice that is powerful and warm and exudes emotion.
3.  Songs that are easily relate-able.  Great live version of 3 remakes from different genre of music.  Folk-pop (Bob Dylan:  To Make You Feel My love); Alternative (The Cure:  Lovesong done beautifully with acoustic guitar); Blues/Pop (Bonnie Raitt:  I Can't Make you love Me).

She sings pop, Rock, Jazz and blues without missing a beat and if you don't have to hold back from tearing from the heartbreak in her ""Someone Like You"" performance, you should check to see if you have a heart.  And if you do not want to jump and rock to her ""Rolling in the Deep"" you should check and see if you have a pulse. I hope that her recent surgery for inflamed vocal chords does not impact her range and tone.

You cannot ask for anything more from a concert!",1323129600,2,1279,4.5
4905226,5,B005Y423ZC,When you listen to her words you can feel what she felt writing her wonderful music. She is truly amazing at the tender age of 21 to be this talented. Granted...she has a nasty mouth on her - which confirms she is still very young!,1323129600,,231,4.155555555555556

4905228,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele is a complete singer and composer. You don't see at these times people who can sing like her. She sings all her best songs and some covers. The songs Turning Tables, Set Fire to the Rain, Rumour has It, Chasing Pavements and of course Someone Like You are beautiful performed. The covers are also great. In my opinion the covers If It Hadn't Been for Love and I Can't Make You Love Me are the best, specially I Can't Make You Love Me, her interpretation will make Bonnie Raitt proud.
About the sound, is amazing. You can feel her performance all the way.
Now the part that is not so good. I was hoping that since this is 2011 they shot this concert in high definition, IS NOT. Of course is Blu Ray, you see better definition than DVD but please!!! I hate the dark bars!!!!
Well I gave 5 stars because even when they did not shot this in HD I still like the concert, how she interacts with the fans and the sound.",1323043200,,918,4.221590909090909
4905229,5,B005Y423ZC,"Sidelined recently by throat surgery, Adele released this terrific 100 minute concert filmed earlier this year in London.  Far be it from me to be critical of any of her songs or of her.  She may be the first musical artist that my ex-wives and I all agree on.  Adele has an amazing voice and is able to write equally amazing heartfelt songs.  This isn't unique to her obviously, but Adele manages to make the audience realize these are snippets from her life and often her hurt shows.  In previous live performances that I've seen, Adele always comes across nervous and a bit shy and overwhelmed.  Not here.  Complete with a fellow Brit, Dusty Springfield bouffant, she seems amazed at her success but approachable, all at the same time.  Her interaction with the fans between songs is sometimes profane and pretty funny.  You won't find much new with respect to the songs if you know Adele's recorded work.  All but two are on her two previous albums.  She adds Nashville's Steeldrivers' ""If It Hadn't Been for Love"" and a tearful cover of Bonnie Raitt's classic ""I Can't Make You Love Me."" The picture on this Blu ray is excellent as you would expect, but the editing and directing is choppy as is often the case these days.  I'm all for audience shots, but they should be longer than 2 microseconds if you want to convey something other than a headache.

 Because of Adele's voice timbre, I noticed it became a bit shrill during certain songs while listening in the DTS-HD setting.  In that surround mode, her voice is very upfront in the center channel.  When I engaged the Dolby Digital 2-channel option all was well.  You may have to adjust your center channel or just go with the stereo mode.  This package includes a CD of all the songs without the chit chat.  An excellent package.",1323043200,2,1791,4.610759493670886
4905230,5,B005Y423ZC,"I love all kinds of concerts including shows with crazy lights, frantic choreography, and fireworks. But an Adele show is the antitheses of those types of shows. On Adele: Live At The Royal Albert Hall, she gives us what we need most of all - good music. While other artists give us their alter-egos in wild make-up, colorful hair, and outrageous outfits, Adele gives us herself where you feel as if you're having a conversation with a good friend. Her personality in all its rawness shines through, and she is intelligently expressive and emotional in her delivery of each song. With that type of power, there is no need for all the other stuff. '21' will stand the test of time, and this concert DVD is one for the collection.

The only song from '21' she desn't perform is ""He Won't Go"" which I love and seem to be in the minority. But for me the inclusion of her performance of Bonnie Raitt's ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" and the Steeldrivers' ""If It Hadn't Been For Love"" more than makes up for its omission. She also performs her biggest hits from '19' including ""Chasing Pavements"" and concert-opener ""Hometown Glory"".

Adele was plagued with vocal nodules during the year that resulted with a number of postponements and ultimately the cancellation of the last leg of her North American tour. Knowing this, you may be worried about the performances on this DVD. No need. Adele is in excellent form here. Many great reviews have already been written and videos samples from the DVD are available to help you decide, so I won't repeat what's already been said. But if you were heart-broken because you held a ticket to one of her shows that was eventually canceled like I did, this DVD is the next best thing.

I remember the last, best one I saw was Diana Kralls' Live in Paris Concert DVD which was awesome.  Finally the greatness of the concert DVD is back with this Adele one.  I am a fairly new Adele fan and have converted my wife and kids to new fans too, so this concert DVD is a great introduction and summary of who is Adele and her songs.  Besides her great songs & amazing voice (great soulfulness), I like the way she talked about the background of each song during the concert and her upfrontness which is refreshing as well as entertaining.  This is a concert DVD worth getting.  By the way she does curse a lot when she talks about her songs during the concert, so not appropriate for young kids.",1322956800,3,917,4.3274853801169595

I admit that I was worried this got rushed out in light of her health problems. I was way off.  Yes, as some folks have already noted, her voice is a little scratchy at certain points.  But she sounds (and looks!) absolutely fantastic.  Really nice production all the way around on the DVD/CD combo makes this a must-purchase. I just sent one to my mom for her birthday and I'll be gifting this all over the place.  I almost lost my mind during the Turning Tables/Set Fire To The Rain back-to-back portion.  Wow...

If, God forbid, she's never able to sing another note, she'll have left us with this spectacular performance.

About the two versions.  She doesn't curse constantly, but there's enough on there that you might consider getting the edited version if you want to play the concert for children.",1322956800,3,909,4.660377358490566

4905238,3,B005Y423ZC,"Amazing and Disappointing!

Never thought the two would go together in a single sentence let slone describe a single entity, but this is exactly what this BluRay disc is.

I was terribly disappointed when I popped in the disc and played it only to feel cheated by this horrible horrible video transfer that can only be described as VHS quality. The better 'hi-def' YouTube videos at 720p has better details, and the pixelations were unforgivable. I am left standing pondering of the chances that the DVD would have had a better video-quality since, unfortunately, the BluRay players activate their 'upscaling' feature only for DVDs but not for BlyRays which, in this case, sorely needed it.

The audio quality too, though the lable claims to be DTS-HD, was found wanting. Her vocals were not as rich as you hear from her CD but the sheer power and melody of her voice more than makes up for it.

To summarise, you don't need me #or anyone else for that matter# to tell you that the concert was simply amazing! Her ""someone like you"" alone was worth the price of admission. I was, however, left yearning for the audio-visual immersiveness of the 'An evening with the Dixie-Chicks' DVD --- a disc that the producers should have taken a leaf off of instead of dumping this shoddy product on the people who make their paycheque. Rest assured you will not be disappointed as Adele takes you away into her musical reverie and almost makes you forget the shoddy audio-visual production.

4905250,5,B005Y423ZC,"I received Adele Live at the Royal Albert Hall DVD/CD set today, which I've been looking forward to for a few weeks. Having already watched the DVD, and listened to the CD, here's my review:

Let's start with the production value, which is a dicey proposition with concert DVDs. This one was top notch. The director did a nice job of capturing Adele, her songs, and the audience. He didn't get too cute with silly camera tricks or over editing, which is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to concert DVDs. I'm watching the concert to see the show, not what cool tricks you learned in film school. I was very pleased with the production value of this DVD.

Moving on to the packaging and content, very simple which equals nice in my book. The box, discs, and booklet have a nice black and white theme to it, which again, captures Adele and her music properly.

The DVD includes the concert (duh!) and an 8:30 clip, documenting Adele from literally her first of coffee to the moment she walks onstage. I'm a sucker for that type of stuff, so I enjoyed that--esp since it was brief.

Now for the meat of the DVD--the concert itself. I always enjoy watching live Adele clips, because not only does she have a great, great voice, but also a big stage presence. She has this aura about her that I don't think even she realizes at this point in her career. Just magical.

The setlist was your typical Adele setlist, with a mix of new/older songs, with a couple of covers thrown in for good measure. Solid setlist. Her voice, however, wasn't the greatest this particular concert. Now, days after filming this show she cancelled the rest of her 2011 tour and had vocal chord surgery and you can tell her voice was tired and not right. It didn't sound bad, it just wasn't the powerful voice I've come to love. Put it this way--an 70% Adele is 100 times better than 99% of the other artists out there, past and present. For that reason, I wish they would have held off until after her surgery to put out this DVD. Perhaps we'll get another one within the next couple of years. I hope so.

Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. Like I said earlier, I love live Adele and to have an hour and 41 mins at my disposal is greatness! This DVD makes me want to see her live even more, which will happen once she returns from vocal chord surgery.",1322524800,156,2317,4.389277389277389

Really low quality as far as Blu-ray is concerned, still sounded great though.  The CD bonus is a nice addition.",1322524800,9,390,4.705882352941177

My only complaint would be I didn't like the packaging, the inside wouldn't slide out and I had to rip the outer shell of the packaging, but even that was kinda worth it for the prize inside!!",1322524800,,315,4.180327868852459
4905257,5,B005Y423ZC,"Absolutely amazing concert without using special effects, but the wonderful voice and personality of Adele, I assure you will not regret buying this DVD. Adele is an extraordinary artist will give a lot of talk in the coming years. Only one word to describe this concert ... ""awesome"".",1322524800,,285,4.958333333333333

4905259,5,B005Y423ZC,Adele never disappoints. If you are a fan this is so worth the purchase. It's also nice because you get to see her live so you get insight into her personality. I loved it.,1321574400,9,172,4.088235294117647
4905260,5,B005Y423ZC,"I was able to preview this and it is with pleasure that I call myself one of the biggest Adele fans ever. It is almost impossible to find someone you don't know that makes you feel as if though they took the words right out of your mouth and put them in song. She said that she concentrated on making music for the ears, not the eyes, but in this video, you're clearly able to see that the eyes get a treat as well- she is breathtaking.

In a modern age, where concerts rely on special effects, pyro, dancers, and theatrics, Adele manages to achieve the same results one would get from such shows by just having a backing band, 2 background singers, and a stool- her voice IS the show! I will be honest, I was worried about Adele having so many throat problems while on tour and when she had surgery in early summer, I was expecting a drastic notice in her voice. You do hear her throat a little scratchy in the dvd/cd but the ""imperfections"" only managed to bring more truth to the songs.

It should be in everyone's bucket list to catch an Adele show- I guarantee she is not to be missed!

4905262,5,B005Y423ZC,"Adele just raised up the music level! Her voice is brilliant. Just by viewing the trailer for this live DVD, I got chills. Just as a few artists out there she actually writes her own songs and that's why she is so special.
She sings with her soul and gives her best every time she performs.
I love her very much and so looking forward seeing this live DVD.
It's just the beginning, Adele! :-)",1320883200,14,392,4.24
