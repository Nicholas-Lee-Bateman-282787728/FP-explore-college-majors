5510257,5,B00AUJH30Q,"Reason why im writing this review cause of how much ""SnS"" has change!! Back then I didn't know what ""Shakugan No Shana"" was about!? So I took my chance and watch it!! The ""First season was amazing!!"" I did not see any anime like it!! You got yourself a boy name ""Yuji"" who use to be human and now realize he become a torch!! But ""Yuji"" is not your ordinary torch!! Inside of him is the ""Midnight Lost Child"" which was originally Johann!! ""Pheles"" forever boyfriend!! Getting carried away, now we have another main character in the series and her name is ""Shana"" Shana was a given name by his boyfriend ""Yuji"" Shana wasn't raise with one!! Were Shana came ""names"" how you say are not important!! She has been raise by the ""Flame of Heaven"" over a century, and yes ""Shana"" is much older than Yuji!! ""Second Season was very cute and has alot more action!!"" >///< I have been reading alot of reviews about ""Shakugan No Shana II Second"" This season focuses on ""Shana & Kazumi"" too see who will receive there love first by ""Yuji"" Season Two you could say is a love triangle storyline!! This is where im going to talk about ""Season 2"" Many people hate Season II cause of ""Less Action and Too Much Romantic Relationship!!"" In my opinion I think Season II was alot much better than Season 1!! The feeling Shana has for ""Yuji"" starts to become stronger!! If you guys are more into action I recommend ""Hellzing, Devil May Cry, Full Metal Alchemist, Dragonball Z Kai!!"" But if you are into Romantic Comedy/ Thriller I recommend ""Toradora, Clannad After Story, Steins Gate, Angel Beats, K-on!! The Familiar of Zero, or Spice and Wolf"" Season III of ""SnS"" is ""Overall Epic"" I don't want to spoil anything for this Season!! If you guys haven't seen Season III yet I recommend going to ""Animefreak.com, Watchanimeon.com, animehere.com whatever site you find!!",1358812800,2,1843,4.63914373088685

5510261,4,B00AUJH30Q,"Season 3 is by far the best season of Shakugan no Shana. Season one was great, season 2 was good but a little slow at times (school festival stuff) - but season 3 surpasses the first 2 seasons by far. This is where things get real interesting, The introduction of more characters on both sides - the Denizens and Flamehaze is really what makes this season great, as well as the culmination towards all out war, where the leader of the Denizens is certainly surprising. I only wish I could have gotten all of season 3 in one set, like seasons one and two. The move towards breaking anime into smaller and smaller sets is irritating to say the least - like they did with Bleach - you could get all the seasons in larger boxes of disks until after the Bount saga, then they started selling the episodes as only 3 disk sets - Anime Companies - Stop doing this - Charge what you want, but stop making collecting episodes more difficult please.  Also I am weary of the push towards Blue Ray - I will not succumb unless regular DVD gets dropped all together - at which point I will be incredible angry. At least thus far you can find the combo DVD with Blue Ray sets - even though I don't particularly like paying more for additional disks I won't use.",1451779200,,1245,4.32051282051282

I would regularly have no complaint, but, seeing as we can no longer buy Part 1, waiting for everyone to buy the leftovers is a really slow, painstaking process. No one is going to buy Part 2 if Part 1 is unavailable!

5510267,3,B00AUJH30Q,"READ BEFORE BUYING! When I purchased the title for this box set was different. It neglected to mention this the limited edition of Shakugan No Shana Season three ""PART ONE"".  I was under the impression that it was the complete third season limited edition box set. So before you but this bare in mind that you are buying twelve episodes for around eighty dollars. However, the box is the same hard cardbord as all of the other funimation limited edition box sets, so its big enough for part on and two. (I even has a card board stand in for where part two can fit into this box.) But again there is no Season three part two ""Limited edition."" You could by the regular part to and put it in the box, but then that would look weird so you might was well just buy the two normal part one's and two's for the same price that you can get this one.

Why the hell Funimation seems to want to shoehorn Greg Ayres in to everything is beyond me, he was DEFINITELY the wrong person to choose for his role. Replacing Brad Swaile with Greg Ayres and Paul Dobson with Kent Williams from season 2 on was a TERRIBLE mistake.

5510282,3,B00AUJH30Q,"Okay, if I was afraid my part one review for season 3 was going to get destroyed, I am utterly dreading this review. Still, I must press on. I hope die hard fans of the show can forgive me...

So, Shakugan no Shana is over. This is the end of the line. It was a fun journey, traveling along with these characters and watching their adventures. The first season was a great hook and took a nice spin on some rather cliche anime and manga tropes. Season 2 stumbled a bit in part one, focusing almost solely on girls' jealousy and love, but part two came back swinging with (to me at least) one of the best anime fights ever--the one against Sabrac. Season 3 part one was a bit difficult to get through whenever Yuji started talking, but the war between the Flame Hazes and Denizens more than made up for it. Now, we finally see how it all ends...
Wait, seriously? That's how it's going to end? Are...are you kidding me? Just...ugh.

Let me back up. Please note, there are going to be MASSIVE spoilers in this review. I'm going to be talking about the final episode and the fate of the two main characters (although if you can't figure it out by the box art, you're not thinking hard enough). So, I say again: MASSIVE. SPOILERS.

As always, let's start with the good: The action. When we last left the Flame Haze army, things had gone south in a bad way. Reinforcements showed up on their flank, Shana failed to prevent The Snake of the Festival from regaining his true body, and things were simply starting to fall apart. Well, now they've really fallen apart. What was a fighting retreat for the Flame Hazes turns into a full on rout as they are slaughtered. Their salvation only comes when one of the Four Gods of earth--basically a cheat character in videogame terms--decides to help them retreat. For the brief moment we get to see him fight, we understand why he is feared by the Denizens.
The second action chunk comes when Shana and her small strike team launch a desperate attack to, if not foil Snake and Yuji's plan, then at least change its outcome. Khasmin and Rebecca once again become the stars here, as they tear through the enemy. Margery is back in all her crazy insanity, and hearing her say her rhymes is a welcome return to the battlefield. We also get two new Flame Hazes (though they were in part one) who join the suicide attack, Chiara and Sale. It's fun watching them, but since they are brand new characters, it really becomes hard to care for them when they're only around for a bit.
Special mention must be made of the other three of the Four Gods of earth. Each one of these characters are truly terrifying to behold--if you're their enemy. One commands what is basically Meteor Materia (Final Fantasy VII reference there) and comes across as very calm and stoic. It's creepy to listen to him talk about stuff as he burns thousands of Denizens while he strolls the battlefield. Next is the water girl, who cries and plead with her enemies to surrender while she tears them apart with water. Last, and probably my favorite, is the one that controls the army of undead. This Flame Haze is crazy. He makes Rebecca look normal in her appetite for destruction. He takes utter joy in watching the Denizens cower in fear while his army eats them. He has no qualms or reservations about what he's doing, and one has to wonder how he became one of the Four Gods. After all, they're not suppose to act unless things get really, really bad, yet this boy loves combat. So it's hard to imagine that he just sits on his hands all day while Denizens do as they please.

Perhaps my favorite part though is when someone FINALLY calls Yuji out on his crap. A character finally gets the best of him for a few seconds and points out all the flaws with his so-called plan on saving Shana, and I loved it. I absolutely loved watching this arrogant kid finally get put in his place by a powerless nobody, and he has utterly no valid response to what is said to him. It was by far the best part of the season.
Finally, there is a touching moment with a certain Flame Haze that really tugged at my heartstrings. Needless to say, not everyone survives the battle, and watching one of the Flame Hazes finally say good-bye and be at peace is sad, but still well written and voiced perfectly.

And then there's the rest of the season. Ugh. Look, if you're upset that I gave this three stars, just go ahead and stop reading. Nothing I say from here on out is going to make you happy. If you want to know why I gave it three stars, keep reading, but be warned: Those spoilers are coming.

This final part of the series tries to do way too much, and it doing so it falls all over itself and ends up cutting corners and trying to force important moments that should have come naturally. First of all, Sabrac falls in the very first episode. Not a problem, as we knew he had to die. What is a problem is that, as he's slowly dying, he starts remembering about a girl that he used to love (?) or admire and he starts talking about her and how he finally understands her. Problem is, this is the first time this girl has ever been mentioned (I have been informed that we actually see her once before this). It's very clear that we're supposed to at least feel a twinge of pity for the master assassin, but since, up to this point, all we've known of him is that he's a cold calculating killer, the moment utterly fails. I was left wondering, ""Who is this girl and why should I care?"" This was just a sign of things to come, unfortunately.

Next, we are cheated out of what should have been a truly epic battle. Notice how I mentioned that only three of the Four Gods are in the battle? Well, the fourth one dies in a fight with Thousand Changes. However, we do not get to see this fight. We see the opening blow, the whole ""It would be a honor to fight you"" speech, and then next we see Thousand Changes talking about the war without a scratch on him. Apparently that fight was so awesome that it simply could not be drawn. This was a problem in part one of Season three as well; the tease of great fights that never actually go anywhere.
Another issue I had is the attitude of the Flame Hazes. The Snake of the Festival gives one speech and their moral utterly breaks. I found that hard to swallow, seeing as these guys have been fighting all their lives, but I suppose seeing the return of the most powerful enemy ever can do that. However, the Flame Hazes just give up on the battlefield. We see them dropping their weapons and fleeing. I'm sorry, but did they forget they're in the middle of a war? Surrounded? By enemies that still have every intent on killing them? Okay, so your moral has been shattered and you no longer feel you have a purpose in life, but are you seriously going to just give up and let the Denizens slaughter you wholesale? Apparently yes.
Then again, the Snake of the Festival was asking them to throw down their weapons, as he had no quarrel with them. He said they wouldn't be harmed if they simply left. I guess his legions of soldiers didn't hear his booming voice, because they rip the Flame Hazes apart. Snake doesn't even mind too much though, because he's not telling them to stop.

Next up, we are introduced to a group of friends of Pheles, the Denizen from Season 2, and this group of friends suffers the same fate as Sabrac's girl: they are thrown into the mix and play a huge role in the final battle, saving Kazumi and helping set things in motion, but we are never given a clear idea of who these people are, why they know Pheles, or why they are helping beyond, ""She told us to."" Again, it feels like these are people the show expects us to already know, because it doesn't have time to explain them to us because it's too busy with everything else.
Lastly, everything that Shana and the others do ultimately has no effect on preventing Snake and Yuji from completing their plan. No, instead, a god-like being gets involved at the very last possible second and gives the bad guys a serious case of guilt trip. I kid you not. All the planning, all the sacrifice, and all it took in the end was for the bad guys to grow a conscience. What's worse is that the show tries desperately to paint Snake and the Denizens as misunderstood (something I can appreciate in an enemy), but fails at it when you are constantly reminded that they have no problem killing innocent people left and right.
All this--the poor writing of characters, the sudden introduction of important characters who we have no idea who they are, and the cop out ending--force me to take off one star.

So what about that second star? Blame that on the final episode.

MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD!

After Snake's plan is successful and he creates a world for all Denizens to live in peace (yes, that was his master plan), he leaves Yuji. Finally, I thought. We get Yuji back. We finally get to find out that he was, in fact, being controlled by Snake and that he only went along with this as far as he did because he wanted to save Shana from her fate of constant battle, but didn't know it would go that far. There was no way he could be a willing companion to all of this.
Except he totally was. Shattering Margery's mind, taunting her about her entire life, assaulting his friends, killing Flame Hazes, mocking Shana, hurting Shana, kidnapping Shana (and that one scene in the bedroom), that was indeed all him all along. This kid is truly a psychopath. And how does he intend to pay for his crimes? Die? Turn himself in? Nope. He planned to wander the new world alone because he felt that was how he should atone. Only, instead of just going to the new world, he decides to stay behind and fight Shana so he can tell her that he plans to go to the new world alone. I kid you not. The two stand on top of a bridge, Yuji states his intentions, and the two start fighting for no real reason. Shana keeps shouting that she loves him, while Yuji keeps saying he doesn't deserve it (which he doesn't in my opinion) and how he's going to leave. Only he can't bring himself to do it because he doesn't want to be actually punished. He wants Shana to stop him and come with him, otherwise he wouldn't have even stuck around to say good-bye, much less fight. There was literally nothing stopping him from leaving with Snake and the rest of the Denizens. Instead, we are treated to a horribly cliche final battle that is more about two kids shouting their feelings, and other things we've known for a long time, at each other for a good fifteen minutes. This final episode was a pain for me to watch. I'm sorry, but seeing what season one did with their relationship, and then seeing it come to this, it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Bottom Line: Shakugan no Shana is done. The fights were amazing and the story concept was very promising, but sadly this finale falls hard into the same pits that so many other overly-dramatized love stories with super powers do. If you enjoy the series, then by all means pick it up. If you want to see how it ends--or just see how wrong I am, as I'm sure many people are going to say--go ahead and watch it. However, if you were starting to have your doubts about the series after Season two part one, then brace yourself for these final episodes.

Okay, that's it. I'm now braced and ready for what I have probably unleashed.",1369612800,17,11359,4.377725118483412

5510284,4,B00AUJH30Q,"I had no plans to write this review because I'm pretty sure my opinion is going to get torn to shreds. However, someone said they liked my view on the second season, and as we all know, we must cave to random strangers on the internet. So, this one's for you, Adam. :-)

Reader, ye be warned here. Spoilers are in this review. I will do my best to limit them and try to keep major ones out of this review, but in order to talk about the first part of the season properly, I must include some details. I apologize.

Season 3 starts off immediately where season 2 finished. And I mean IMMEDIATELY. Yuji is still walking in the snow and still appears before Shana. Shana gets super excited that Yuji has chosen her, runs into his arms, they kiss, and together set out to finally shut down Ball Masque, the group that's responsible for almost killing Yuji and Shana on multiple occasions.
No, wait. That's not what happens. Instead, Yuji looks at Shana, and then wanders off only to magically disappear. I kid you not. Shana sees him, smiles, and then he vanishes. I was not aware that Yuji had the ability to willing make his existence vanish from the mortal realm without even Shana being able to sense it. Apparently his training has been going extremely well.
What follows is a rather impressive war, with massive powerhouses on both sides and the promise of epic show downs between long-time rivals (who are suddenly introduced, but treated as if we should know who they are anyway), and previously important characters getting completely shelved in exchange for even more carnage on the battlefield. It is all rather impressive and is a joy to watch as Flame Hazes and Denizens tear each other apart in the final battle to decide the fate of the world.
Too bad it has to be completely overshadowed by Yuji's stupidity and Shana's conflicting emotions. Ugh.

Okay, let's start with the good. Season 3 is the start of the war between the Denizens and the Flame Hazes. Ball Masque has resurrected their leader, so all the Flame Hazes have joined together in order to put a stop to his plan. And the battles are epic, or at least when you get to see them. Several times, the battles are started, but then you only get to see the end result. What a tease. Other fights you don't even get to know the outcome of until Season 3 part 2, and by then you will have forgotten who these characters were. It is a pity, because the taunts that the characters throw at each other before they fight, or during the opening blows, imply that there are some seriously deep feelings of hatred and contempt between them and they have yet to use their true strength, but we never see that strength.

However, there are other battles that are impressive to watch. Wilhelmina's, Rebecca's (a new Flame Haze), and Khasmin's three-way battle with with Sabrac is probably the highlight of the entire season. Watching Rebecca's utter joy at destroying her enemies is also fun because of her completely reckless abandon in battle. It's nice to finally have a good guy character who takes such joy in her work. That's usually a role reserved for bad guys. Khasmin fans, myself being one of them, will be pleased to finally see him put his Stone Golem to use. And when he does, it's exactly as you'd expect: he decimates his enemies and nothing can stop him.
The Denizens have their own star players however, and watching as just a handful of them cut down dozens of Flame Hazes is sad, but at the same time exhilarating. After all, what's the point of having cannon fodder if you're not going to use it? The action is back up to the level of Season 1 in the war. It gets a little hard to follow at points because several characters who we've never met before have grudge matches against each other that we're apparently supposed to already know about, but the fights are so fierce that you will quickly find that you don't care why a certain Flame Haze hates a certain Denizen.

Sadly, you have to suffer through a bit of emotional drama--and to me, downright creepiness and arrogance--before the war starts. Here comes those spoilers that I warned you about. No, seriously, here they come.

Remember when I said Yuji vanishes? Well, he's with Ball Masque again. Only this time, he willing went to them. That's right. The very people who have tried to kill him, the girl he loves, and wipe out his beloved hometown (just an hour or so ago, I might point out), are now his buddies. WHAT?! And the reason Yuji gives for joining them is possibly the most cliche, melodramatic, reason I have ever heard. Also, if that is his reason, then he has chosen quite possibly the worst way to go about it.
However, what really  becomes hard to swallow is Yuji's sudden change in character. He becomes the vessel for The Snake of the Festival (the big bad boss of Ball Masque) and goes completely nuts. He returns to Shana and demands that she comes with him. Naturally, she refuses, and Yuji goes straight Anakin Skywalker on her. He attacks her, causes Margery Daw to have a psychotic break and slip into a coma (smiling and mocking her while he does it, by the way), assaults Wilhelmina, and ultimately ends up kidnapping Shana. His reason for doing all this? He loves her. Apparently getting untold power does some wicked things to your definition of 'love'. There is even a scene in Yuji's castle where things get a little too close to rape. Yuji forces Shana on the bed, and when she starts screaming at him to get off of her, his response is that he's shocked that she doesn't like him anymore. Not because he kidnapped her, or attacked her, or is now the leader of the very people she has sworn to fight. No, he thinks it's because he's stronger than she is now and she's jealous.
Complete. Mental. Break. With. Reality. These are signs of a psychopath. It's hard to believe that this is the same kid from the previous two seasons because all this is coming out of nowhere. There's no slow change, no tortured soul searching. He is just BAM! Evil. However, Shana and the others keep telling themselves that, despite what Yuji and Snake are saying, Yuji is being controlled against his will and all they have to do is save him. More on that in Part 2.
Yuji continues to strut around like he's big stuff for the entire first half of the season. He bleeds arrogance and several times I found myself having flashbacks of how Anakin behaved at the end of Revenge of the Sith: A spoiled brat who thinks his way is the only way now that he has the power to crush anyone who thinks differently. From a certain stand point, he makes an EXCELLENT villain because I did not like him at all. However, the reasons I didn't like him are not the right reasons for disliking a villain. His logic for doing what he's doing is circular and full of so many holes that I simply wanted to grab him by the shirt and shake him. He does do a good job of inspiring fear in his former normal friends though, and the art style they use on him when he's walking around his home town does give off the proper feel of, ""I don't think I want to approach this guy on the street.""

Speaking of normal friends, Ogata, who played such a huge role in season 2 and a bit in season 1, may as well not exist for the amount of time she's in this part. Same goes for Ike. I think he had one line of dialogue. I can understand why these characters are basically invisible--there is a war going on now, after all--but it really felt like they had been forgotten completely. All that time getting to know them over the past two seasons, only to see them tossed aside. Tanaka and Kazumi also have diminished roles, though they still take part in some of the action. As for Satou (still confused on whether or not his name has a 'u' in it), he's joined the fight against the Denizens by joining Outlaw...only to get completely shelved when he has to take care of Margery in her coma. Thanks, Yuji.

Technical stuff: The dub is the same as season 2's parts. If you liked the voice cast then, they're all back here. With the addition of so many new characters, there are also a lot of new voices, but none of them seemed to stand out.  Trina Nishimura, who voices Rebecca, does a good job of capturing the Flame Haze's wild side, and Kara Edwards has a small role, but those are the only two there that I can recall. Probably because they both have staring roles in Heaven's Lost Property.
The extras are you what you've come to expect: Shakugan no Shana-tan shorts (although here is actually just one big short instead of several small ones), trailers, and commentaries. No Q & A this time. Yes, it comes with a Japanese version with subtitles as well.

Bottom Line: The action in this first half is the star of the show. As I said, Flame Hazes and Denizens rip each other apart with reckless abandon. Whenever it cut away from the battles, I wanted it to go back because I wanted to see more. Khasmin shines the most out of all the Flame Hazes, though that could simply be because he's my favorite. It's just such a pity that we have to suffer through Yuji's Sasuke-like attitude before we can get to the actual war. His character change and his motivation and reasoning are so flawed, so arrogant, so, ""Oh my God, would someone please shut this kid up already?"" that any time he opens his mouth to spout his ideals, the series trips hard. Or at least for me it does. And since over half the season is him doing just that, I'm forced to take off a star.
Oh, and wait until you hear what the most powerful unrestricted spell is. It made me roll my eyes and, if you've ever watched any anime, you're probably going to know what it is long before it's revealed. And you're going to spend the entire time going, ""Please don't be that, please don't be that. Anything but...ugh.""",1369526400,13,9793,4.456218627997769

5510286,1,B00AUJH30Q,"I love Shakugan no Shana. The entire series is great.

However, we don't own a Blu-Ray player, and frankly don't feel like supporting the move to phase out DVDs so fast after they were made. So it's a choice of not being able to watch it, finding a (possibly illegal) version online, taking chances on it being on Youtube, or buying a Blue-Ray player just to watch this one show. We're not doing that!",1366502400,2,401,4.418918918918919
5510287,5,B00AUJH30Q,"The final battle that began at the beginning of season 3 continues. The fight has spilled over into the human world, and many lives are lost. Yuji's betrayal has shocked everyone, and left the Flame haze army at a major disadvantage. He clearly has a goal in mind. But being the emotionally clueless guy that he is, fails to make his intentions clear to Shana. He revels that he wants to create a replica of his city on the void. This will serve as the permanent home for the denizens. Shana does not accept this, and the 2 continue to fight to the death. They are not alone. Many others are involved. Some that have become dear friends and some that neither of them know. But many of them are lost along the way. In the end, will Yuji and Shana be together, or will they be torn apart? Can Yuji forgive himself for perpetrating this terrible war upon the world, and can Shana stop him? All the questions we have had up to now will be answered. For better or worse, this is the end.

I was shocked by the final season of Shana. It went in a completely different direction than I expected it to. In some ways I was disappointed, but I was also blown away at the same time. Season 3 almost felt like an entirely different series from the one we have come to know in the first 2 seasons. The entire final season is 1 giant battle. There are dozens of new characters introduced that play major roles. The person we have come to know as Yuji Sekai is almost non existent. He has merged with the Snake Of The Festival and become an entirely new being. So it feels like we have lost something important to the plot.

Even though the story seems so different, it is definitely still the same Shakugan No Shana that we love. I think that we all had ideas about how it would end. We knew that at least one persons heart would be broken, and we had a pretty good idea of whose it was gonna be. It just weighs heavy when it actually happens. The fate of Yuji and Shana was also a big surprise. I felt happy and sad at the same time. This is definitely an epic and emotional conclusion to a series that I have come to love so much over the past year since I discovered it. I think every anime fan should watch this series. And it goes without saying that season 3 is a must as well. I hope you decide to check it out, and I hope that you really like it.",1364688000,13,2340,4.163355408388521
5510288,5,B00AUJH30Q,"Yuji has disappeared following the battle that concluded season 2. All that he has left behind are the memories that his friends have of him and the love letters that he received from Yoshida and Shana on Christmas Eve. After some time, he returns, but as the leader of Bal Masque. A battle erupts upon his return. He takes Shana away with him and leaves Marjorie injured and in a coma. Keisaku rushes to Marjorie's side and realizes how much he loves her. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina, Khamsin, and Rebecca Reed (an old friend of Wilhelmina) set out to rescue Shana. In the midst of all this, a full scale war has broken out between Bal Masque and the Flame Hazes.

I was very surprised at how this season began. All of a sudden Yuji is gone, and a bad guy? Well, I guess that's one way to stir up some drama. The war that breaks out between the opposing sides is pretty cool and I was also very shocked at what transpires between Keisaku and Marjorie. So far, season 3 offers some incredible plot twists, tons of action, and some touching drama. As you may expect, the animation, voice acting and soundtrack are all excellent. I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this season so far. There are a lot of new characters introduced that also play some key roles. I do wish that they had been introduced earlier, but that's all I can really say about this part that left me wanting to know more. Overall, I'm thrilled. It's just a shame that the end is in sight. In her final hour, Shana burns brighter than ever. This is one anime that you would be a fool for missing.",1364256000,,1572,4.36518771331058
5510289,3,B00AUJH30Q,"Okay, I got my copy of Shana Season 3 early thanks to rightstuf.com and just finished watching the entire series recently. The end of
Shana is finally here and I have to say its about time.

If you buy the limited edition it comes with a nice chipboard to hold both parts in. And as with the usual Funi releases its
blu ray and dvd combo pack.

There's quite a slew of extras on here from the usual textless opening and closings to even more clean closing songs that were part
of the anime that had credits on them. But there are a few that are not included on here which puzzles me. Episodes 10-12 on the first
set didn't receive any clean endings for them. Episodes 13 and 15 got clean openings to them but the last two episodes did not...

Yet all the other episodes that had extended closings also received them. Those were some of the things that puzzled me and makes me wonder
if I should import the Japanese BD's if those are included. Its nice to have them since watching the credits play upon the beginning intro or endings tend to be annoying when you're trying to enjoy the action at the end and credits are rolling on top of them...

Anyways the picture quality is much higher than that of the previous seasons and looks a lot sharper (Season 1 and 2 were upscale, but I really couldn't tell the difference honestly...). The animation is great as well.

Well if you liked the previous seasons of Shana then you should go ahead and get this. I actually liked the ending. My only problem with this
season is that it introduced other Flame Hazes and they hardly get any screen time to make you actually care about the characters. I also noticed they would start battles or would set them up but not actually go through with them. One of the major annoyances I found. I'm going to be the oddball here and say that I actually enjoyed Season 2 more than 3. There's other things in here I wish they spent more time developing in Season 2 so by the time Season 3 comes things would actually make sense. I'm not going to go into spoiler territory so you'll just have to see for
your self.

I myself watched the dub of both seasons 2 and 3 respectfully. And I have to say I enjoy Funimation's dub over the Ocean Group. Some of Funimation's voices were a mixed bunch but wasn't terrible like some of their dubs have been lately. It does makes some scenes weird when you go back to flashbacks of the first season. Although I never really cared for Tabitha St. German's voice for Shana. Everyone else in The Ocean Group was okay. I my self is more of a fan of the Japanese version. Now that I've checked the dubs out of Seasons 2 and 3 I'll go rewatch them in Japanese.

One more thing, if you're planning to skip Season 2 and jump into 3 just be warned they do a lot of flashbacks to Season 2. So some things might not make sense and it does help if you watched the Second season since Season 3 picks up right where Season 2 left off. Another thing I noticed was that the beginning of episode 1 where Shana and Yuji have their stand off (after Yuji becomes a Denezin) they never show that scene again in a later episode... Just something I noticed...

Its a pretty good show considering. I think J.C. Staff handled this much better than the Familiar of Zero and Aria (another show that has potential).

If you're a Shana fan check it out. You don't want to miss the ending.",1363132800,3,3373,4.299212598425197
5510290,5,B00AUJH30Q,"Unlike season 2 this season gets back to the story, charter development, ect. This season is as good as season 1. IMO season 2 left alot to be desired, just seemed like they were milking the series for all the money they can since nothing really happened to the end of that season. Seemed like their was alot of episodes that were for the most part just filler to kill time. Not to mention it was almost 100$ as well.
  Season 3 on the other hand is more like season 1 in that it focuses more on the story and characters development, just not them runing around killing time and goofing off thru alot of it..
  Like season 1 this season is a little slow paced but not enough that it won't keep your attention. My only complaint is how they handle Yugi's char makein him into a bad boy. Yes i understand how this comes about but just didn't work  for me, this just totally goes against how his charater was in the 1st 2 seasons.
  Also the Funi dub u will either like it or hate it.
  Then again the price. Over 100$ this time, come on Funi this is riduculas. Its obivous their tryin to milk this series for all they can. I for 1 will be waitin for this to drop its not worth over 100$ for basically 600 min of show, but thats just me. Does piss me off though because i don't like haveing just 2/3rds of a series. I mean really why is this higher than season 2 since theirs basically the same amount of episodes.
  All in all if u liked the 1st 2 seasons u will like this season, and its well worth geting but u will hafta deside for yourself if its worth the asking price of over 100$, for now i for 1 will wait till the price drops.",1359331200,,1633,4.071875
