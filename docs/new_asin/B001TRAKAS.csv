3793602,5,B001TRAKAS,"This is review is for ""NBC News Presents: Yes We Can! - The Barack Obama Story (2009)"".

This is a ""Must-Have"" for everyone, young and young at heart, regardless of political affiliation/agreement or disagreement as the case may be.
Content: This DVD is filled with excellent footage with superb sound, some of which were never aired on the news. Lots of personal moments that may not have been considered news worthy at the onset of Obama's journey. This DVD complements the ""CBS 60's All Access"".

Video Quality: This is a master piece both in content and in production. NBC put together a master piece in this one. Unlike the Beijin Olympic video. Chapters, speeches, events, etc were all masterfully layout for easy navigation and selection in case you don't want to use the Playall option. I highly recommend this DVD for everyone both for personal use and as historic memorabilia.",1241568000,21,886,4.9
