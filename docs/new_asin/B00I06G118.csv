6244847,5,B00I06G118,"And introspective things, and hilarious timing, and directing by John Landis. I bought more than one to give as gifts and my friends love me for it. Only thing missing from the DVD is Kettle Korn.",1396828800,8,196,4.472222222222222
6244848,5,B00I06G118,"I saw this when it aired on Showtime in 2011.  Wendy's brand of humor is like no other.  You think that she is about to tell you a sweet and innocent story like about being asked to put her cigarette out because it's bothering someone and her response is, ""well it's killing me!""  This one hour special was filmed before a live audience in North Hollywood, CA.  Wendy takes you through her life but with humor, talking about her spouse, her stepkids, parents, siblings and pets.  Definitely a good choice if you want to laugh!",1395792000,12,526,4.494736842105263
8637754,5,B00I06G118,"Great deadpan delivery and ""mutter"" of wonderful material.  Just be aware that if you have seen her on television, on YouTube, or in person, much of this is the same jokes and stories she has been using for many years.

I loved Wendy's show so much that I sent Hydrox cookies to her!",1527638400,,283,4.320754716981132
8637755,5,B00I06G118,"There are moments in life where you can look at someone with complete honesty and say, ""This is the best [name subject] I have ever experienced in my entire life"".  A song that moves you more than any other.  A dish that is so impossibly delicious to the point that your mind has never experienced anything that incredible before or after.  When you look at someone and your heart almost stops because you just realized there is no other person who is that beautiful on this planet.  When you are certain that you have reached a level of appreciation and excitement like never before.  These are epiphanies.  Quintessential moments in defining what makes us tick.  In the entire world of comedy, Wendy Liebman is that person.  She is so far above and beyond the concept of simply, ""funny"" because she is capable of reaching for - and combining - extremely polarizing concepts which create ridiculous, but intelligent dichotomies like no other person has ever done before.  Her style is not a joke.  It is razor-sharp genius.  It is a force that needs to be reckoned with.  Science needs to study her technique.  HONESTLY.  ""Taller on TV"" is a non-stop battery; a cleverly designed summation of Wendy's classic ""hits"" from her first years as a standup comedienne, combined with her current slick notions which I've watched over and over and over again.  And still roll laughing each and every time.  If there ever was an end-all performance in the world of comedy that we should pass on to other civilizations in other galaxies to define the highest level of intelligent humor in our world, it is this collection.  Wendy walks on stage and hits high and keeps the magic alive from start to finish.  You will be in awe.  I promise.",1488931200,,1729,4.703333333333333
8637756,2,B00I06G118,"Funny for a few seconds, until you realize that you are hearing an imaginary drummer play, ""Ba-da-BOOM!"" after each of her sad jokes, most of which you've heard before. Better to have a movie ready.",1486944000,,198,4.685714285714286

8637759,5,B00I06G118,Such an intelligent an witty comic - a once in a lifetime show!  I have 3 sisters and we are all early fifties (one almost fifty) - I had to send them all a copy!  Thank you!  I cannot wait to see Wendy in Boston someday!,1420675200,3,221,3.760869565217391

8637762,5,B00I06G118,"""Wendy Liebman: Taller on TV"" is easily the most wonderful comedy special I've had the pleasure to watch.  Ms. Liebman is a joy, a lovely, original and brilliant stand up comedian that not only fills her hour with huge laughs but also includes many insights into her philosophy, life and career.  Her humor is so much more clever and well crafted than any other comedian out there and this hour special delivers!  ""Wendy Liebman: Taller on TV"" a comedy special you can watch with your friends and family, many times over just to catch all of Wendy's genius.  The technical aspects are all top notch, as well -- the phenomenal director John Landis (""Animal House"") is one of the producers!  Beautifully shot and edited.  Highly recommended!",1401580800,5,739,4.825396825396825
