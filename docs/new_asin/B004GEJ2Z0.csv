It is a Lebanese production, and it has three episodes of a low production value Arabic children's show starring two women and one man as the hosts. I was hoping for better songs, but the songs are really silly songs specifically created for the show. The show is kind of boring too. I wouldn't buy any more episodes of this series.",1332806400,2,431,4.2682926829268295

For parents of Middle EAstern Origin trying to raise their kids in America speaking Arabic, this CD provides fun and enjoyable songs that even parents will like singing.  One of the songs even brings tears to my eyes by the way it describes a child's love for his family members.  I personally can't wait to get my hands on more of Nizar Fares' CD's as they are my children's favorites (ages 5 1/2, 4 and 2).",1296950400,3,555,4.53
