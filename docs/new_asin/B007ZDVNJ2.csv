5115084,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"When I heard about this movie I had very low expectations.  It was low budget, and used only child actors.  For such a mature theme I thought this was be a very bad movie, but since I liked the topic.  When I watched it I was very surprised.  It was very well done, and I enjoyed it very much.  There were humorous elements, and I think they portrayed Robspierre perfectly.",1337904000,24,373,4.271428571428571
5115085,5,B007ZDVNJ2,My dad saw this on a religious cable channel and loved it so I bought it for him,1423353600,,80,3.5
5115086,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"Excellent movie, I recommend it to all who want to know more about this part of officially ""forgotten"" history of France.",1416787200,,121,4.809523809523809
5115087,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"When I first heard that child actors would be cast for this movie, I was not expecting much.  But the kids did a great job and I even forgot that they were children within 30 minutes of the start of the movie.

This is a story that I never knew or was ever taught (as is also the case with the Cristero War which is what ""For Greater Glory"" is based on).

The kids (as well as the parents) found this movie to be both enjoyable and informative.",1391904000,,444,4.0227272727272725
5115088,5,B007ZDVNJ2,Wonderful movie.  Great to see that their are a lot of young actors/actresses who really seem to get into this picture.  Yes I would recommend this movie to all who enjoy history/France or a innovative movie.,1386979200,,208,4.75
5115089,3,B007ZDVNJ2,"The War of the Vendee needs to be remembered by history, but I am just one of those people who wasn't particularly moved by this movie, which was acted entirely by children and young adolescents. Don't get me wrong- everyone involved deserves kudos for a clean, pious and historically significant drama, but what it amounted to in the end was a high school play with quasi-Hollywood production value. The one exception for me was the scene in which the Martyrs of Compigne defied their Revolutionary judge and embraced their fate. The actress playing their Mother Superior was very good and created a moving and emotional scene. I'd recommend supporting this worthy movie, not necessarily for its technical excellence but for its holy message, the earnest efforts of its actors and off-camera producers, and for the Cause of the Cross.",1381968000,5,835,5.014388489208633
5115090,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"Tonight I watched this movie on EWTN. Since I enjoyed it very much I plan to purchase a copy for my video library so that I can share it with my grandchildren. I especially enjoyed the young actors, they did a marvelous job. Too often folks watch a movie that is based on historical events without realizing that it is not fiction. Throughout the 2000 years of church history there have been persecutions of those who follow Christ, beginning with Christ Himself and continues today. Heaven knows that our young people get very little in the way of world history, and the little they do get has been woefully revised. ""The War of the Vendee"" was excellent as far as I am concerned and I highly recommend it as entertainment as well as a learning tool to teach some history to the young.  Then have discussions with them about the film.
Since I like movies that are fact based, two other great films I would recommend is ""There Be Dragons"" and ""For Greater Glory"", both are history based and are excellent and you might like them too.
Good night and God bless!",1380067200,4,1059,4.515625
5115091,2,B007ZDVNJ2,I was excited to see the movie bc of the topic. 10 minutes in I realized it was all kid actors and I just couldn't buy into the movie bc of this,1380067200,2,144,3.53125
5115092,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"I was amazed at the depth of the script and the performances of the young cast.  I must admit, I was skeptical about this film.  However, it exceeded all my expectations.  I wholeheartedly recommended this film.",1380067200,,211,4.805555555555555
5115093,4,B007ZDVNJ2,"The seller and carrier did well, but I wished most the actors were adults.  Still, the youth did an amazing job!  We all should know this story and ""For Greater Glory"", because we may experience it, someday soon, as the ""tolerant"" become increasingly intolerant (actively so through the courts and government policies) to those who conscientiously object peacefully!  This is much needed inspiration!",1378684800,4,400,5.317460317460317
5115094,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"I chose this movie because I had heard of Jim Morlino.  He works with children who are interested in film-making, to give them exposure to the industry and to give them a chance to develop their talents and skills.  He researched this aspect of the French revolution extensively to incorporate elements from the Catholic peasants' side that are not generally included in other productions about this war.  I would recommend it for people of all ages.",1378598400,3,450,4.894736842105263
5115095,5,B007ZDVNJ2,I got this mainly for my kids thinking it wasn't going to be that good. Mad was I wrong! This move was excellent and told a story of a persecuted Church and the heroic response from the faithful. A great lesson for the Catholics of today.,1378512000,,238,4.195652173913044
5115096,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"This is a very nice movie to get for kids and people who don't mind a bit of cheesiness in the acting. most of the actors are good but they are all children so it is a little strange until you get use to it. The story of the movie is very good for lifting up morals and reminding you that we must all fight for what is right. but as it says on the DVD itself, it is not really the way it happened. So if you are looking for an accurate historical movie about the french war this is not the movie for you. But if you are like me and want it as a good Catholic story to entertain a child it is very good .",1372464000,,603,3.682170542635659
5115097,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"These kids are an outstanding cast.  Morlino and his crew have put together a fantastic film.  The primary target is children/families, but my wife and I watched it while our toddlers were in bed and we loved it.",1371254400,,212,4.552631578947368
5115098,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"Je suis Franais, je suis mme originaire de la Vende Militaire, o se sont passs les vnements dcrits dans ce film. Je peux vous dire que ce film est la parfaite retranscription historique des vnements, sans dformation. Tout y est vrai. Il faut absolument faire connaitre cette histoire au monde entier et mme en France o elle est malheureusement mal connue et trop souvent dforme. L'interprtation par des enfants est une ide trs belle car elle facilite et humanise le contact avec des vnements tragiques, elle apporte une posie indniable. Un magnifique film !!!!!",1364774400,3,561,4.9787234042553195
5115099,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"We enjoyed watching this solid Catholic movie as a family... while my hubby and I's interest wasn't completely piqued like the kids... I have to say it's become the kid's second favorite movie... right behind Tin-Tin!  There was a lot of giggling initially when they saw that kids were playing all the parts, and at some of the things the kids do... the kids thought it was funny because it wasn't as ""real"".  It's now become a favorite and I have no issues with it as well.

From an adults standpoint: if you are looking for a movie for you, pass on it. It's all children who are acting and so there are teens of the same age playing grandmother, mother and teenage daughter. This is silly and confusing from a ""regular movie"" standpoint. The plot is solid and good, but again, the production is not high quality. VERY good for how they made it, etc... but more on the level of a VERY well-acted out play as opposed to a traditional movie. That being said their musical scores were the exception to this... they were REALLY well done and I highly applaud who did them!!!  And most importantly for me, it teaches a very good, Catholic story in a way that is COMPLETELY safe from this ultra-protective Traditional Catholic mom's standpoint!  That in and of itself is a huge plus and I appreciate that they did that.  I love that I can hand it to the kids with ease.

But of course it's not the adult's standpoint that's important because we are not the audience. The kids are thrilled with the idea that other homeschool families like them made this movie; they can connect more with the characters because of this standpoint as well.  They like seeing all the cute little siblings of the main actors and enjoy seeing them participate in the acting. The story is very attractive to them and teaches them honor and respect, etc... and history as well (which happened to coincide with my 5th grade daughter's MODG history... a HUGE plus!). And the bloopers... DEFINITELY KEEP THIS UP... the kids LOVED them and even us adults did. Those are actually some of my fav. things on a dvd and I am so glad to see the extensive ones here.

So I highly recommend it for the other Catholic homeschoolers out there and I will gladly buy up any of their other productions for the kid's Christmas and Easter presents!",1361404800,11,2301,4.525301204819277
5115100,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"The movie is wonderful and (considering that the movie was made by young homeschooling children) an A+! It was very fancinating and very informative on a topic that is little known, as well as humorous. A great movie for children and adults who are in search of decent films to watch.

Navis Pictures, keep up the good work! My family and I are axiously awaiting the next movie you make.",1357171200,5,387,4.5285714285714285
5115101,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"A truly inspiring story with young people playing the parts of mature adults. The story of how devout Catholics of France defied the bloody tyranny of the Revolution. With excellent photography , music and costumes this film has a very professional finish, but it is the performances of the youngsters coming to grips with serious adult problems that lifts the heart.",1356048000,7,367,5.032786885245901
5115102,1,B007ZDVNJ2,"As an orthodox, practicing Catholic, I was disappointed with this movie.  Low quality production values, children playing the roles of adults and banal, predictable ""out-of-sync-with-video"" dialogue forced me to stop watching the dvd after about 30 minutes! I was expecting something along the lines of ""Joan of Arc.""  This movie, however, did not capture or hold my interest as an adult at all.  Now, perhaps children would find the movie worthwhile. but I did not. It was a big waste of my money and time.  The production reminded me of the TV series ""Little House on the Prairie"" which I enjoyed very much but ""Vendee"" was much worse.  I do not recommend it - especially for adults.",1354838400,8,685,4.82051282051282
5115103,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"I was amazed by this movie! I guess that I wasn't expecting too much from it when I heard that it was mostly child actors that were mostly home-schooled. I couldn't have been more wrong! I saw it at a Church gym/auditorium and it was full and at the end there wasn't a dry eye in the whole place!

This is a good historical piece and I think a real inspiration for children of alot of age groups. Good for a look back at what a group of people did to keep their Faith, and also good to see what can be done by child actors.

See it, buy it! I just recommended it to a friend, too!---Bobbi",1345420800,15,588,3.9745762711864407
5115104,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"This was a hit for my grand children. Children are the actors and actresses and they are quite good, better then most professionals.
It was historically accurate and totally age appropriate.  I look forward to the next movie they make.  We enjoyed the movie on Saint Bernadette this company made as well.",1344297600,10,304,4.826923076923077
8523373,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"I thought it would be cheesy, but the beauty of the truths of the Catholic faith and the bravery and heroic courage of those men and women shine thru. The fact that it was fellow Catholic homeschooler made it even more special. You and old, Catholic or not will enjoy this movie.",1525305600,,279,4.384615384615385
8523374,1,B007ZDVNJ2,I should have read the description of the product. The informative dvd I was expecting turned out to be an adolescent school play.,1518134400,,130,4.695652173913044
8523375,5,B007ZDVNJ2,I bought two of these. Gave one as a gift and loaned the other out before we even saw it..........It's still making the rounds and we haven't seen it ourselves.,1508630400,,160,4.366666666666666
8523376,2,B007ZDVNJ2,"I read that it had youngsters in the cast; however, I did not expect it to be virtually the entire cast. The acting was on par with a high school performance in the United States with a smattering of junior high and elementary students.
It is a wonderful story; however, at the price, I expected a professional acting performance. It was totally unbelievable for an adult to embrace these performances.
Perhaps, it is a wonderful for a middle school aged kids. If you are older than 12 or are not going to share it with people 12 and under, I would not suggest this purchase.",1499731200,,575,4.485714285714286
8523377,5,B007ZDVNJ2,Phenomenal Movie!  All the actors are children and it really makes it enjoyable for kids and adults alike.,1486425600,,106,4.888888888888889
8523378,5,B007ZDVNJ2,Excellent movie that our family has watched many times. Love it.,1481500800,,64,4.909090909090909

8523381,5,B007ZDVNJ2,"Amazing production.
Very moving. The director stays within the practical limits of his youthful ensemble.
On the 200th anniversary of the start of the French Revolution, there was no celebration in la Vendee.
They had rather Masses for their ancestors murdered by the French army.
In America, we all celebrate the Fourth of July. A good thing. In the South we do not forget the 700,000
Americans murdered in Lincoln's Civil War. Lincoln is responsible for many more deaths than Marat
or Robespierre. Now when they take away the body of General Forrest and his wife in my hometown
of Memphis, I blame Obama rather than Lincoln, and Obama and his ilk will soon be gone.
But the Vendeeans will never forget Jean Paul Marat.",1464480000,,720,4.768
