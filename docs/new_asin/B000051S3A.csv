1386809,5,B000051S3A,"I proudly own both DVD collections, & am eager for more!  I've spent an entire Sunday watching a good portion of the episodes contained on these DVD's.  Gale Storm & Charles Farrell are excellent in this series & have a fine chemistry that is apparent in this sitcom.

Gertrude Hoffman is also a treat as Mrs. Odetts, always dragging Margie into another of her screwball schemes.  That Mrs. Odetts is one agile & feisty old Lady.  LOL.

As all 195o's sitcoms, it's a bit dated, but still manages to hold up quite well, even today.  I'd gladly take this show over all of the garbage on the tube today.  To me, it's a timeless time capsule to the infancy of tv comedy when comedy was truly funny & didn't need to resort to tactics of vulgarity to get a laugh.  My Little Margie was & still is funny & highly entertaining.  Hopefully season sets will be put out at some point, this series deserves to be put back into mainstream syndication on Television as well, rather than to sit on a shelf collecting dust somehwere.

All who feel the same about wanting to see upcoming DVD releases of this series, please cast your vote at the TVShowsOnDVD site.",1116720000,46,1147,4.466346153846154

Now...maybe...but not back then---
OK - Compared to Lucy this show comes up way short...anything probably would. Still, it's interesting. The sitcom in it's infancy. The ""hooks"" -  Margie's rolling-her-tongue sound, Vern's direct-to-camera double takes (left over from the Roach silent film days). Mr. Honeywell's voice.
Me? I'm glad I got it. Just for the amazing opening and closing theme music.

1386811,2,B000051S3A,"This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the ""chewing up the scenery"" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else.",1071446400,6,208,4.648648648648648
1386812,5,B000051S3A,"Bless Gale Storm and Charles Ferrell for being in the right place at the right time. By doing so they made television history with ""My Little Margie."" The viewer can see a real love between ""father"" and ""daughter"" in this show. There's none of that ""give me my fat paycheck so I can get out of here"" attitude that is so easily seen in today's sitcoms. Vern Albright's ""Boston"" accent is a real treasure and Gale Storm is an angel. When I was a kid watching this show first-run, I had a big crush on Gale Storm. I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I'm sure at 81 that Ms. Storm is still beautiful and still getting into mischief.
Unfortunately, Vern Albright, Mr. Honeywell, Mrs. O'Detts, and Freddy Wilson have all gone on to TV heaven, but we can still enjoy them over and over again in this wonderful 12 episode set.
For the most part the sound and picture quality are GREAT! If you love classic TV sitcoms from the Fifties, you will love this set.",1071187200,137,974,4.357142857142857
1386813,5,B000051S3A,"When I first discovered that a two volume DVD set of My Little Margie was to be marketed, I couldn't believe it! I didn't think I'd ever see even one show from this great old series again, let alone the 24 that are included in these two sets. Besides, I figured, even if this early/mid-fifties gem ever surfaced again it would be on TV Land or Nickelodeon and would be ruined by nightmarish commercial breaks (we have DSS), squeezed end-credits, and inane voiceovers.
VCI to the rescue! I've just reviewed the two DVDs in this first set and watched the first two shows on disk #1 and am extremely pleased! Knowing how things unfortunately are sometimes done these days, I had feared a poor quality transfer and a certain amount of butchering to have been done, but that's not the case at all, thank goodness!
I recall these shows from my early childhood, and they look and sound exactly as I remember them. Even the elaborate musical score that accompanies the end credits is there, complete and impressive as when brand new. The opening gimmick, where the facing images in the father/daughter photographs talk about each other, are there too--still clever, still cute, still funny! In fact, these shows are exactly as first viewed almost 50 years ago, but thanks to the clever writing (those early TV writers cut their teeth in the demanding medium of radio comedy) and the outstanding talents of Charles Farrell and Gale Storm (sigh!), these shows are still funny and engaging. I couldn't be more pleased!
One last note about the quality. We tend to forget how relatively murky television was in the Fifties. Broadcasting equipment was primitive but improving rapidly. However, because microwave and satellite transmission had not yet arrived, network affiliates in the major cities actually got their prime time shows from the networks in the mail!!! Yes, the studios sent out 16mm film copies of the shows, and that's how the local stations showed them in the appointed time slots. Over the years ensuing, hobbyists have collected these old affiliate films, and that's in part why they are now available and in such good condition. Since these My Little Margie DVDs are made from those fine 16mm broadcast originals, instead of kinescope copies, the image quality is actually better than when they were originally broadcast! And the sound, while not stereo or anything like it, is at least up to mono TV broadcast standards of 15 or 20 years ago.
My verdict -- these are terrific DVDs, and if you like lovely, perky, endearing, sparkly-eyed feminine firecrackers, you will love Gale Storm, just as I did as an 8-year-old boy!",986428800,159,2629,4.870535714285714
1386814,5,B000051S3A,"How wonderful for VCI to bring this classic TV series to DVD.This extremely popular show from the 50's even rivaled ""I Love Lucy"" while at it's height. DVD quality is surprisingly good considering that no restoration has been done - images are clear with only a slight visible grain - sound is acceptable.  However bios. are sketchy ad incomplete - Gale had an immensely sucessful recording career(check out her CD - Dark Moon - The Best Of Gail Storm on Varese Sarabande), which she gave up at it's height to work on another prosperous TV series ""The Gail Storm Show"", a precursor to the Love Boat"" TV series.  Margie is real classic TV - contrary to public opinion, the 50""s are classic television - not the 60's or 70's.  Hey, ... - pick it up!!

1386885,4,B000051S3A,"This television show ran from 1952 through 1955. I remember watching My Little Margie as a very young child, and time has not diminished the capacity of the show to charm this viewer. The comedy might seem a little hokey in this day and age  but the 1950s were a simpler time in many ways, despite some of its problematic social issues.  In watching it, the viewer should keep in mind that the show is reflective of the social mores of the time. So, it serves as a fascinating glimpse into our social history, as it can be quite politically incorrect at times when compared to today's social mores.

Margie Albright, played by the very pretty, irrepressible, and adorable Gale Storm, is the twenty one year old daughter of the distinguished looking Vern Albright, who is vice-president of an investment firm. The role of Vern Albright is played with great charm by Charles Farrell, a veteran actor who began his career in silent films. The Albrights live at the posh Carlton Arms and lead a nice upscale life.

The only fly in the ointment is that Margie keeps coming up with wackadoo schemes to get her way. Margie is often aided in her crazy ideas by her elderly neighbor, Mrs. Odetts, played with great verve by Gertrude Hoffman, a veteran character actress. Vern's boss, Mr. Honeywell,  played for all it's worth by  veteran vaudeville performer and  actor Clarence Kolb, often gets involved in the wacky doings initiated by Margie. Vern's girlfriend, Roberta, is played by the lovely and elegant Hillary Brooke. Margie's doltish boyfriend, Freddy, whom Vern loathes, is played by Don Hayden.

There are six episodes in this volume, which vary  in comedic quality, with some funnier than others. The film quality of this archival series is what one would expect from film that has not been remastered. It is grainy with occasional blotches and streaks running through it. The series  should be remastered to preserve a glimpse into what life was like in the nineteen fifties and what people then thought funny.",1441238400,3,2014,4.828488372093023

The show is about afunny lady that gets herself involved in all sorts of problems because she can't keep out of other people's business (mostly her Dad's).  The humor was definitely different then than it is now.  Somewhat similar to ""I Love Lucy,"" just not quite as good.

1386932,5,B000051S3A,"This isn't a remastered effort as far as I can tell, but the picture isn't too bad; a little better than you would expect out of old stuff.

I write primarily because I like this show immensely and wish there was more of it. I grew up seeing some repeats of this show, but I was convinced there was something always better to do or watch. Man, did I miss out! This is a VERY funny show, and once more shows the genius of Hal Roach. You see his influences on many of the ways people react and how the action is cut, etc. Every single character in this show is funny, which is really a rarity. I don't know, buy maybe the makers of this dvd put together all the best Margie, or focused on all the episodes with conflict, but from what I see of this dvd anyway, this is a very nutty show and there's constantly scheming and conniving going on. This show puts I Love Lucy to shame; just brilliant! Until I got this dvd, I had no idea at how much scheming went on between father and daughter. I knew Margie was that way, but I just had no idea so much of it was focused on the father. Man, do I ever want to see all four seasons of this gem, if nothing else just to see periods where it wasn't this superb.

A favorite episode of mine sees a gangster giving Margie a surprise super-smooch, but then later springs another surrpise on her (literally) and the two crooks laugh their heads off at her. Where else have you seen that, where thugs surprise a victim, not once, but twice, and then laugh their heads at them afterwards? I've surely never seen that. It was awesome to see those complete strangers (gangsters) pull stunts on Margie, because she is so deserving. I WANT MORE!!!!!

I'm sorry. I've since learned that My Little Margie was produced by Hal Roach Jr, not Hal Roach as stated previously. I was under the impression that Sr did this because he lived so long, and that he in fact was named Jr and not his son (if he had one). His son obviously took a lot of talent from his father. It turns out HR Sr had produced some shows, including The Charles Farrel Show into the late 50's, so I wasn't too terribly far off.",1395273600,,2122,4.208845208845209

As expected, with hal Roach, Jr., at the helm, we get an intelligent mix of visual and verbal comedy - Charles Farrell, a veteran from the silents, was perfect as the clean cut, wonderfully tailored, Investment banker; a widower with a 21 year old daughter, who is *the* antecedent of today's Feminist lead characters, ""smart and sexy""...but 50 years ahead of time. Major difference: she does not shout down her dear ol' Dad...just manages to teach him a lesson...with a soft voice...and Love.

The humour derives from each character trying to outdo the other, in good-natured schemes: when one decided the other was overstepping bounds...a wild scenario develops. Usually Vern is left holding the bag. Very much like Ollie.
and the viewer can never be sure where it's all going!

Two standout shows are ""The Missing Link"", a pleasant satire of the early 1950s' ""wrestling craze"" - Margie invests in an unsuccessful, but good-hearted Wrestler, to show Vern that she can make a better deal than what he offered to her through Honeywell and Todd; and, ""Hillbilly Margie"", written by Three Stooges writers, Ullman and Bernds, who really excelled with ""rural"" themes: Mountain people have inherited valuable stock and H & T seek to buy it from them: Margie and Vern dress up like backwoods folk. It's more than a bit hackneyed, but it works..in fact, it's got many elements found ten years later, in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" - even has a character named ""Ellie May""! The remaining characters must have also been referenced or I'll eat my Sunday go-to-meetin' top hat!

Going back to the Laurel and Hardy connection, it was Roach, Jr., who caught the BOys on ""This Is Your Life"" in late 1954, right around the time MLM was still popular, and offered them a regular show. One can only imagine the quality and care that would have been invested in the actors, who spent years being kicked around the Fox and MGM lots, following their great period with Roach, Sr., 1927 to 1940.
What a shame that only the first Laurel and Hardy TV show had any kind of first draft as their poor health prevented any progress.

But imagine what even a cameo on My Little Margie would have meant!

The Lucy Show addition is in colour, from the '60s. Very entertaining, though increibly predicatbel and with some golden lost opportunities. As good as this episode was, we realize that Margie was really at the same level of I Love Lucy, in this Reviewers' opinion.",1320451200,2,2695,4.797413793103448
1386969,5,B000051S3A,"Once the most syndicated show on television My Little Margie is never shown now and is rather scarce on DVD.
Thanks to releases from Synergy, VCI Entertainment and a couple others we get a chance to see this little gem of a show from a bygone era. The Synergy episodes are good quality and compare favorably to other MLM sets - realize though that these are from the mid-1950s and not remastered.
I did notice on Synergy's Volume 1 set the episode order is erroneously listed on both the box and the DVD menus
with the fifth title actually running first. The correct order is ""The Contract"", ""Countess Margie"", ""Honeyboy Honeywell"", ""Margie's Mink"", ""Shipboard Story"", ""Who's Married"". A little confusing but it eventually dawned on me that I wasn't seeing the episodes I had selected from the menu.
A minor issue to me secondary to having nice quality copies of these rare episodes - just an FYI.",1315353600,,897,4.719745222929936

I remember this being on in the mid afternoon - which meant that if I was watching it, it meant that I hadn't gotten shoved into my room for a nap.

Then there is ""Topper"" the TV show. It was one big smoking commercial. Well I sort of counted on this happening with ""My Little Margie."" Boy was I surprised. The plots are complex for the small period of time they have to execute in. Hokey or not they had me laughing. And Price per pound, you get twelve episodes. I am working my way through for a second time. When I get tired, I will put them on the shelf and they look good in the box set.",1257638400,26,615,4.049180327868853

1386996,5,B000051S3A,"What a treat to own this compilation of ""My Little Margie"".  I also ordered Vol. 2 and I hope that more will follow.  Sadly, Gale Storm passed away on June 27, 2009 and was the last surving cast member and star.  She was truly a pioneer and paved the way for many wonderful comedic actresses who followed.  The other actors are great too, especialy the very distinguished Charles Farrell.  Like I Love Lucy, these episodes are still funny and we can all use a little light humor today.  I wish that a DVD was available for Gale's second series, ""Oh Susannah"".  It was like an older version of ""The Love Boat"" and Gale sang in the series.  She had several hits and a great voice.

This DVD is  a high-quality reproduction of those shows starring Gail Storm and Charles Farrell. The supporting cast is outstanding with many wonderful cast members that played supporting roles in films of the 40's including Willie Best as Charlie the elevator operator (""Ghostbreakers"" with Bob Hope), Hillary Brooke at Vern's girlfriend Roberta (""The Woman in Green"" with Basil Rathbone, Abbott and Costello TV show) and a host of others.

Gale Storm was very funny and different from the competation in those days when ""I Love Lucy"" was popular. She played off all her jokes from her TV Father and brought something to the show that families could relate to. Gale Strom had another series called ""Oh Suezania"" about a Cruize Director on a Cruize ship. Her co-star was ( if you ever heard of her ) Zazu Pitts, a very funny comedian. I loved both of Gale Storm's television series, they were both very funny. I would like to get the DVD of ""Oh Suezania"" too. ( My spelling might be bad, sorry)",1140393600,19,730,4.367647058823529
