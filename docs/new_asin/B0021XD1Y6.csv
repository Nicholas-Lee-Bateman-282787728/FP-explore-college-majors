3841530,3,B0021XD1Y6,Sound good - dancers good - but no way to pick specific dances to work on without a listing to choose from.  I would like to be able to play #32 and then #50 without having to go through the entire list to get to what I want to practice.,1362700800,,237,3.74
3841531,5,B0021XD1Y6,My wife and I were new to dancing let alone square dancing.  We used this DVD in conjunction with the beginner classes in our town and it was very helpful.  I think we've watched it more than ten times.,1328745600,,202,4.153846153846154
3841532,5,B0021XD1Y6,"This DVD is a great and easy to use Mainstream instructional reference as others have endorsed.
Has been a VERY helpful coach.
Much better than the online and You-Tube videos I had been using.
Sadly the outstanding featured caller, Paul Place, died in 2008.
The only issue with this 2007 production might be that the numbering system for the dances/calls changed slightly in 2009.  The call names are all the same, but the order/sequence is slightly different from how it is now taught/ordered.
A plus is a Traveling Hoedowner's Pin (for attaching to badges) was also included.
I plan to get the ""Plus"" DVD when we undertake those lessons.",1299628800,5,639,4.862385321100917
3841533,5,B0021XD1Y6,"We signed up for square dancing lessons but were starting six weeks behind. We purchased this video to help us catch up and practice the different moves. It is very helpful to review between lessons also.  Do not expect to be able to learn square dancing without lessons though. This is a great supplement. The video and audio quality especially come across as less than professional but it works anyway. Square dancing is about fun, not perfection.",1290816000,3,449,4.8311688311688314
3841534,5,B0021XD1Y6,"I just recently became interested in square dancing and decided to search for a really good video.  The Traveling Hoedowners Basic & Mainstream Square Dance is the best.  The instructions are clear, the demonstrations easy to follow and they incorporate the recently learned steps into the square along with the new steps (as kind of a review).  Some of the steps I have been unable to learn at my square dance classes are now clear and I am able to do them.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn square dancing or brush up on their moves.  I am really glad I bought it.",1269561600,3,589,4.416666666666667
3841535,5,B0021XD1Y6,I am a begining square dancer and was fortunate enough to discover this DVD on Amazon.  I find it extremely helpful as a supplement to my own lessons.  Also makes a great gift for my square dancing buddies.,1266710400,2,206,4.394736842105263
3841536,5,B0021XD1Y6,"The Traveling Hoedowners have produced an outstanding instructional DVD for beginning square dancers! The basic and mainstream dance steps are very clearly demonstrated by this fine group of square dancers. The DVD is especially helpful to me as I have had some memory loss. I or anyone else can go over any square dance call as ofter as needed to get it memorized. (Additionally, I received my DVD very quickly. I ordered it on a Friday and received it the following Monday.)

Thank you to The Traveling Hoedowners!",1258416000,7,516,4.863636363636363
8349530,5,B0021XD1Y6,Easy to understand calls.  The dancers are wearing matching outfits which help to keep couples together when moving.,1515801600,,116,5.444444444444445
8349531,5,B0021XD1Y6,"I really enjoyed watching this instructional square dance video.  The traveling Hoedowners are a very accomplished square dancing group.  They are colorful, do things with alot of flare.  They are very exciting to watch.  I just finished taking the basic Mainstream squaredance lessons, and I enjoy seeing and heaing different callers and different call descriptions.  I appreciate one comment made by the caller, Paul Place.  He said that if you see something that seems to contradict what they are telling you to do at your local club, that you should follow the directions of the local club.  This shows alot of humility, and that they are just doing their thing, and not trying to change others.  I highly recommend this video.  I think that it would help new dancers to learn, and I think that it would be a good review for the more experienced dancers.",1484870400,,858,4.821917808219178
8349532,5,B0021XD1Y6,"I am planning on getting this dvd soon.  Heard it was great.  I feel very honored to have just received the Paul Place scholarship to calling school at Callerlab.  I'm sad to hear of his passing, and hope that I can honor his memory with doing a good job calling.  If you haven't tried square dancing, you should!  It is so much fun, and nothing like the ""in the gym during P.E."" experience that many groan about.  Some serious fun, great people, and you won't even realize how much exercise you're getting since it's so wonderful!",1463875200,,531,4.479166666666667
8349533,5,B0021XD1Y6,"Earlier on, a few days ago, I had come in here and reviewed. it was not a good review :(..I AM SORRY.... because the DVD was wonderful, but I was unable to get to all of it.  I expressed my disappointment at that time.  The lessons that I had seen were great, well taught and made me feel that I could do this!
I was so amazed that the sellers immediately contacted me to ascertain the problem(s) that I was having and, yes, they indicated that it was rare to have an issue with their DVDs.  Whomever responded took the time to go over how to get all from the DVD and sent me instructions and a list of all of the calls....I followed their instructions  ..even got a new control for my DVD player and VOILA!  they were correct.  We watched all of the calls and they were wonderful.  We cannot wait to get the plus disk so that we can start reviewing that!  Thank you for coming on so quickly and providing me with the information that helped me with my own DVR.",1445126400,,961,4.1567567567567565

8349537,5,B0021XD1Y6,My husband and I reviewed these lessons often while we were learning Mainstream.  We still review them often for reminders on certain calls we feel rusty on.  They have been very helpful to us.  A true step by step guide.,1410739200,,221,4.475
8349538,5,B0021XD1Y6,Our patrons are always asking for Square Dancing DVD's.  This one was great and arrived very shortly after I placed the order.,1372723200,,126,4.7272727272727275
