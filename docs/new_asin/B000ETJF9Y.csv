8223153,5,B000ETJF9Y,"This must-see classic for any music fan features the ultimate line up of Clapton, Harrison and Dylan and great Indian music. I think this has got to be the first benefit concert of its kind done at the time. It's a masterful musical journey that gives you one of the best concerts ever...all for charity. Unfortunately, for the people of Bangladesh it took many years of legal mumbo-jumbo for them to ever see any of the proceeds. The musicians' hearts were in the right place, though. A must-have for your collection.",1148601600,,518,4.7032967032967035
