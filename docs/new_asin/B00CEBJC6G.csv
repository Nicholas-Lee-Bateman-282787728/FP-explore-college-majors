The other counties were fascinating but I do not believe I would want to take  the same boat rides that she did. We have been to five countries in the south of Africa so we have experienced many of the cultural aspects of these countries.

We found her narrative fascinating and very enjoyable. It is very enlightening! I highly recommend this video!!!!",1377129600,5,466,4.470588235294118

5717277,5,B00CEBJC6G,"This is a quest for the Nile's source, a trek originating at the Mediterranean Sea. Travel is southward--up the Nile. A premier level travelogue, and the tour narrator and guide is Joanna Lumley. She makes it an adventure with comedy. The Nile's over 4000 miles, and the film account of the journey covers African countries of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. Educational, as well as fascinating entertainment. Excellent film footage. Kudos to the overtaxed camera team. Some, like one man met on the journey, may remember Lumley as a Bond Girl in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969).

SDH SUBTITLES available for all 4 episodes
1. Alexandria to Cairo via train, then by camel to Giza and the pyramids. Travel continues by luxury cruise ship followed by meager accommodations on a barge. Visits include a date farmer and a man who tells of the demons on the Nile.

2 A ferry crossing of Lake Nasser takes Joanna and viewers into Wadi Halfa and Sudan. It is a less accommodating adventure through these parts compared to that experienced in Egypt (Ep. 1). See Nobian dessert crocodiles, mountains, tomb of a queen, and modern-day desert nomads.

3. At the point where the two Niles meet (White Nile and Blue Nile) Joanna learns a secret of the area. She then heads to Lake Tana, Ethiopia, and the Simien Mountains. Even watch a car wash--Nile style. A ceremony at the location of the Blue Nile's source.

4. Joanna flies over the world's largest swamp (Sudd) and meets a beauty queen, a Rhino sanctuary in Uganda, and then joins with adventurer Cam McLeay in the final quest--the Nile's source in the Rwanda mountains. In 2006 McLeay was part of the team that discovered the longest source of the Nile, a 3199 mile river, the world's longest. This episode offers a delightful look at area wildlife. Animal film on the Nile done as well as NG.

As Joanna Lumley so often stated on camera, ""It's just fantastic.""

5717280,5,B00CEBJC6G,"We have all heard of the Nile, that mysterious river that flows through Africa. I have friends who have taken a Nile cruise, but not the entire river. In fact, seeing the Nike all by River is impossible. There are too many warring tribes in some parts of Uganda and Rwanda to make this possible. This is all an informational note to let you know what a wonderful experience you are about to have once you watch this 4 part series.  Joanna Lumley, the English actress, takes us along on her experience, exploring the Nile from the top in Egypt to Rwanda, the source for the Nile, 4,000 miles later. Johanna has a lovely whispery voice that puts yes at ease right away. She is kind and welcoming to all the porters, guides, trades people, she meets along the way. She has quite a retinue who are filming this documentary, and the result is superb.  I enjoyed this documentary immensely, each of the four parts is about 45 minutes long, filmed expertly, and filled with sights that are just spectacular.

This four-part series goes through five countries, variety of cities and communities, and Joanna  tales part in excursions along the way.  It begins in Egypt with a side trip to the pyramids. We are privy to the private train cars and luxurious river cruises, that Joanna takes part. Then to historical sites in Khartoum, crossing the desert by car, and into the luxurious beauty of Ethiopia. Johanna loved her experiences and the beauty of Ethiopia. We meet the famous 'Girls Gotta Run', girls from small towns in Ethiopia, who train to run in the thin mountain air, they run to become first class runners. What an extraordinary adventure to meet them. And, then, finally to Lake Victoria in Uganda and then deep into the wilderness in Rwanda in hopes of finding the source of the Nile.

Joanna Lumley is beautiful, a vegetarian and maintains a lithe figure. She wears heavy eye make-up all the time, but, indeed, her eyes are a beautiful feature. Her clothing for the most part is beige, whitish/ tan linen. But, when needed,she puts on the boots and the gear needed to climb into the mountains. She has a very stoic nature, and her adventures are many and varied. Her temperament is warm and welcoming. She is a superb guide. She has a good sense of humor and is self deprecating.

We are privy to all the cultures along the Nike. Joan a talks with families and other native people's, so that we get a feel for this part of the country. She tries native found and drink. One if the more fascinating parts for me was the interview and climb with Cam McLeay, the explorer who discovered the true source of the Nile in 2006.

I found the entire four part series superb. Joanna Lumley has a similar series on a trip to Greece. That is my next view.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-10-15",1420848000,3,2787,4.580321285140562

5717282,5,B00CEBJC6G,"I've always been a big fan of Joanna Lumley; I didn't know about this travel DVD until  recently, however---once I learned of it's existence, I purchased it.  I have  always been a big fan of Egyptian culture, which is what also lured me to this item.  I have to preface this review by saying, I'm disabled, so I would never be able to travel.  Joanna, instead, is traveling for me, in a way; this DVD takes you places you can't really find on many travel films.  For example, she goes to Ethiopia and we get to see the landscape (absolutely hauntingly beautiful) like the mountains there.  But most of all, I love her sincerity.  She's 'right there' with the people of the countries she visits; you can just feel her personal interest and fascination with the the peoples of the African people she meets along the way.  And the people respond positively to her sincerity.  I love the fact that while in Ethiopia, she gets baptised by the Ethiopian/Orthodox priest; he must have felt the goodness in her heart and soul for him  to have done that. I highly recommend this DVD to any 'arm-chair' traveler like myself.  You will come away from it feeling very positive. In a way, by the time I was done watching,  I felt almost 'healed'.",1412812800,5,1234,4.529411764705882

5717285,3,B00CEBJC6G,"Since I have just reread The White Nile and The Blue Nile I thought this would be interesting.  We have been to Egypt twice.  Am not thru with the DVD yet.  However, Joanna dresses to the nines there in every scene so far, and we all say where does she wash her hair which is perfect as is the makeup and how do all those white outfits get so white, and how come she didn't drop dead from drinking water from the Nile....there has been fluff to the DVD so far but of course so far they have gone 2,000 miles south toward the source of the Nile with over 2,000 miles to go.  Perhaps we will see her in boots and jeans.  The music sometimes drowns out the audio as she has a British accent.  I am hoping the rest will be better as she goes further south.  Still glad we bought it.

5717286,3,B00CEBJC6G,"Lumley presents four episodes of her journey ""up"" the Nile.  The first episode is unbearably bad (I've already done that part of the journey so I know all she missed).  She picks the most mundane things and babbles on about herself to no good effect.  The second episode is better, but she doesn't really settle into the journey and making a good documentary until the third episode.  Three and four contain much more about the sites and their history.  The human interest parts relate nicely to what is covered and I was glad to have watched them.  If the episodes can be purchased individually, I'd buy the last two and just take it from there.",1387497600,,646,4.573913043478261
