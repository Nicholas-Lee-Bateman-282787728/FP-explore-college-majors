5272965,5,B0096AYKXI,Great price for two blue ray movies in one convenient bundle.  Also it's fun for the whole family to enjoy.,1340323200,,107,4.35
5272966,5,B0096AYKXI,The movie came packaged well and no problems.  My family loves the series and this was a perfect addition to our DVD collection.  I know we will enjoy it for a long time.,1338336000,,170,4.121212121212121
5272967,5,B0096AYKXI,"Before buying this item, I read e review that turned out to be most incorrect. It is also the first review you read. It is by 'Shawn'. 'Shawn' is confused, upon opening the box, removing the discs has no bearing on the packaging, you simply open the little windows on the front of the box and the tab on the side slides out and in to change the characters. Removing the discs from the top is just that, removing the disks from the top. So what?? This just goes to show you, reviews are like the media, don't believe everything you read.",1296604800,2,536,4.264705882352941
5272968,4,B0096AYKXI,Love Ben Stiller's movies.  In Blu-ray they are even better.  We laughed again even though we've seen NATM several times before,1292025600,4,127,5.0
5272969,5,B0096AYKXI,"I still gave it 5 stars. I wish you could do half stars. I would have docked it half a star for the fact that it's 2 full cases that come in a very nice cardboard box. EXCEPT, the cardboard box is not an open ended kind on the side so you can just slide the regular plastic cases out the side. Instead, check my photos. You will see you have to open the flaps from the top and pull the cases out. Which is sad because it's a nice box with pull tab that changes the characters in the windows. Instead the box is a pain to keep moving the cases in and out of. I got this box set for about the same cost as just the 2nd movie. And you get the Blu-Ray only version of the first film (I happen to already have the first film on DVD). And you get the 3 disc Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy set of the 2nd movie!

And since it's just the 2 normal cases in a box. It's like buying both separately but cheaper in my case. It just would have been nice to see this nice cardboard box with an open side so I could keep it on the shelf and still get the movie cases in and out easy. Such a simple thing that would have made this box set top notch.

Read the reviews of the Blu-Ray versions below. The first film has some quality issues. But is still a huge step up from the DVD version. And the 2nd film has a good video transfer. Link was removed to the review, google for the blu-ray review. (not the movie review)",1291852800,42,1398,3.9017543859649124
5272970,5,B0096AYKXI,"For those of us who loved these movies and paid much more than this, these movies are a great bargain and a great joy to watch. Perfect in so many ways and two movies that all the family can watch and appreciate.",1291507200,10,212,4.071428571428571
5272971,5,B0096AYKXI,"I love this series, Ben Stiller was not really a favorite of mine till I saw these movies, now I like him a whole lot better. I just wish my mom survived long enough to see the last one, she would have loved it. But this review is not about the last one, it is about the first two, and I will say, the first one, by far, is always the best. Nothing can beat seeing the reaction on Larry's face when he sees Rexy for the first time. It is a great movie to sit down with the kids and a bowl of popcorn to watch on a miserable weather day. The kids will enjoy it, and so will you. BTW, this movie is actually based on a children's book created for small children. Look it up, on Amazon!!",1494288000,,684,3.892857142857143
5272972,5,B0096AYKXI,"Like many other people I found the first two ""Museum"" films to be more engaging and with better plots than the third in the series.  I was pleased to find the two together without the third but some of you may want all three.  Excellent images and sound in the Blu-ray version and it is noticeably better than the standard DVD version which I also own.  Great buy for the two bundled together.",1494028800,,393,4.3561643835616435
5272973,3,B0096AYKXI,"Great movies.  Of course now there are 3-movie collections.

No extras, so nothing to entice you to buy this one, over the 3-movie sets.

Those are the only reasons I only give it 3 stars.  Basic set of two movies.

In fact, the blu ray of the original Night at the Museum contains two commentary tracks, and a trivia track, so in that sense it has more to offer than the collections.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-at-the-Museum-Blu-ray/dp/B000NOKJBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night at the Museum [Blu-ray</a>]",1490659200,,562,6.063291139240507

5272983,4,B0096AYKXI,"I bought this after a family trip to New York City. The Natural History Museum was a highlight of the trip. The first movie has a nice New York vibe with iconic footage of Manhattan. The sequel does the same with Washington DC.

The premise of each story is that history comes alive at night in the museum, and night guard Larry (Ben Stiller) has quite a time trying to control the situation. The humor gets slapstick at times, but it works.  There are also deeper themes for adult viewers. Basically, these movies have both kid and adult appeal. This is very fun movie to add to your permanent collection.",1471910400,,606,4.5

5273007,4,B0096AYKXI,"After purchasing the third movie, we realized we didn't have the first two. How did that happen? Our movies came from Solo Enterprises. I like that both movies came in one case, but beware that the case is not as sturdy as normal cases. When I opened it, the plastic has the recycle symbol cut out of it so it is easily bent out of shape, possibly damaging the discs. This is not a major problem for us, but if you have kids that might be roughly handling the case, you might want to continue your search.",1453075200,,505,4.216494845360825

Night Museum guard Larry who is likable and all business when it comes to his museum and the artifacts and displays that come to life every night. We all know the stories for both of these movies so I won't bore you but I will say....what a cast and they look to all be having a blast especially the late Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt. Whether it is the Museum of History in NYC or in the second one at the Smithsonian both are treasures and good for the whole family....I love Rexy!",1421712000,,636,4.264462809917355

5273094,4,B0096AYKXI,"absolutely fabulous special effects, brilliant cutting, snappy direction.....shocking disclosure > actually is a NEW funny movie!

a kind of fantasy within a fantasy, the main attraction for this reviewer, a great chance to say ""goodbye"" to Robin Williams (he's a little restrained and has no funny lines, though) and Mickey Rooney (a wonderful treat to see him as I thought the man had passed). Dick Van Dyke is excellent as a secret ""insider"", shall we say.

I detested the unflattering close-ups of Van Dyke and Rooney..but it's nice they were included. (have not seen earler editions, so I don't know if that is part of the ""series"").

hate to say the movie runs about 8 minutes too long.

5273126,5,B0096AYKXI,"We visited the Field Museum in Chicago this summer and our girls loved Sue.  We realized recently they had never seen either of these movies and picked this set up.  They were both a hit.  They are 7 and 10 and getting into history so they loved the idea of the museum coming to life at night.  They thought the dinosaur was great.  Great gift if you are looking for a movie for a kid - I would think a stuffed TRex from Cuddlekins would go great with this!  Nice to have a set of films that are age appropriate (no sex or violence), little bit of history thrown in and a nice background for the film.

Yes, the cover box is not one that the movies slip in and out of easily, but it has windows that open and you can pull a tab to change the character inside.  Both movies inside are in regular blu ray cases.",1395532800,2,809,4.044025157232705

If you like these movies, why wouldn't you they are terrific, if not then don't it's as simple as that.

Pros: Great movies
Good special features (I liked the commentary track on the first one)

I usually reserve my blu ray purchases for those have to have movies or for the big blockbusters with killer special effects.

That being said this series was a lot of fun to watch, that monkey always cracks me up.  The picture and sound were fine on dvd and they're still fine on blu ray.  I can't say that I can see a big difference.  The box it comes in...not a fan of it and I basically just tossed it away.",1382572800,,578,3.982608695652174

5273152,4,B0096AYKXI,"So you should buy this to have the full collection, but I have to say: unlike most movie franchises, the sequel here is far better than the original. There are some truly hysterical moments in the sequel, and Frank Azaria should have received an Oscar for his performance. And here's one thing worthy to note: a lot of kids movies try to work in jokes that only adults will get to keep the adults entertained -- but the jokes are usually sexual in nature, a lot of double entendres. And I'm no prude, but still: it's not very original. In Night 2: Battle for the Smithsonian, the adult jokes are laugh out loud funny -- and none of them have to do with sex. They parody co-workers we might all relate to, or songs that we know, or -- most of the time -- historical figures. If you know even the tiniest part about history, you'll be laughing out loud at Custer in this movie. I feel like these sorts of ""adult"" jokes required far more creativity than making yet another pun on the phrase ""come out"" or showing adults coming to the door in dissheveled clothes...and you'll laugh more because of it. This is one of the very few movies that when my 5 year old son asks me to put it on, I eagerly watch with him (and he's watched both of these at least 20 times since we purchased it, so they get a lot of miles...)",1362873600,,1311,4.248
