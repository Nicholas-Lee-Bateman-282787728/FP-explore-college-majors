7828192,5,6302499399,"""Private Snafu"" was intended as a training-guide for American soldiers during World War Two.  (""Snafu"" meaning Situation Normal All F...ed Up!)  It also provided ""training"" for some of Warner Brothers' greatest cartoon talents.  Many sight-gags, jokes, & plots used in later Warner's cartoons of the late '40's & 50's were actually lifted from the ""Snafu"" cartoons.  (The TNT in the piano gag used in several Bugs Bunny cartoons & the air-force made of mosquitos are examples of ""swipes"" from ""Private Snafu."")  There's a great deal of satire in the writing as well, thanks to Ted ""Dr. Seuss"" Geisel, who actually wrote most of the scripts.
There's historical significance as well.  These cartoons, uncensored, reflect the attitudes America had of the Axis at that time.  Many of the words & descriptions would be deemed offensive by today's standards, but it's important to remember the times & the context from which these were made.  (It's also important to remember that for every negative stereotype Americans held towards the Germans, Italians, & most especially the Japanese, the Axis held towards Americans, as well as the British, the Chinese, & the Russians!)  I""m Asian-American by descent & though if I were to see Asians (actually, in Snafu's case, Japanese, since China was on ""our"" side) stereo-typed today the way they were in the Snafu cartoons, I would be offended.  However, watching the way they're drawn in these (period-specific) cartoons...well, it's kind of funny!  (It's a guilty pleasure!  And again, let me repeat, this was war!  I've seen Axis propaganda & they didn't pull any punches when it came to Americans!)
The animation is excellent.  However, since these cartoons were intended for soldiers, they are not recommended viewing for children!  (Besides the racial stereo-types, there's plenty of suggestive dialogue & situations.  Funny stuff, as long as you're over 10 years old!)  However, if you're a cartoon fan, a historian, or if you just like a good (guilty) laugh (& there's lots of that!), then this series is definately recommended!",1022457600,5,2075,5.164670658682635
7828193,5,6302499399,"I don't know about you, but I'm fascinated by these propaganda cartoons of the early 40's, and I can't help but wonder what the axis would have done if they had placed as much value on animation as Hollywood did. This tape stands up to repeated viewing. I would highly recommend this tape to anyone with an interest in vintage cartoons.",990662400,5,336,4.524590163934426
7828194,2,6302499399,"This is a wonderful collection for the Chuck Jones/Mel Blanc collector, HOWEVER, it is censored and not nearly as good as the DVD version.  It has a collection of cartoons that time forgot and is definately geared towards those who can remember the end of WW2 from a ""been there"" stand point, rather than a history book view.
Get it, but be wary.  The complete uncensord DVD is much better!",975196800,,390,4.557142857142857
