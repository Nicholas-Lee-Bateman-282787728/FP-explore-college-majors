775448,1,6304077912,"In my opinion, RUN DMC is the best rap group ever.  This movie, however, is a poor witness to their talent.  Run, DMC (Darryl Mac) and Jammaster Jay play detectives and vigilantes in the muddled plotline.  Around the time this movie was released, the RUN DMC's popularity was beginning to decline.  Unfortunately, this movie helped that along.",1004659200,2,343,4.964912280701754
775449,4,6304077912,"This RUN-DMC biopic is a real treat to watch.  The story is entertaining and the musical guests (Slick Rick, Beastie Boys) are truely memorable.  It is important, however, not to take this movie too seriously.  Nearly half of the characters aren't  portrayed by proffesionally trained actors, only rappers who pull it off pretty well.  The producers in this movie are protrayed by the def jam duo Rick Rubin and Russel Simmons, who are pretty good actors.  But if you are expecting oscar performances, remember these guys aren't movie stars, but friends having a good time hoping to promote their artists.  Definitely worth seeing!",1002067200,2,631,5.067961165048544
775450,4,6304077912,"This B movie is a classic.  You'll see many of  your favorite groups when they just began in the business...Run DMC, Beastie Boys, Fat Boys and Slick Rick.  Also interesting is the difference between what rap was like back  then as compared to now.  A must have to all collectors or fans of the  legendary group Run DMC.",914284800,11,320,4.431034482758621

7860884,3,6304077912,"Although nothing about this film is Oscar worthy, it's reminiscent of the days of classic hip-hop/rap music. Sadly enough, this film will probably never see a DVD release, due to poor VHS sales, as well as a rumored injunction filed by the Beastie Boys.",1464220800,,253,4.7727272727272725
7860885,5,6304077912,Wish it was on DVD. Love the movie,1430438400,,34,3.375

7860887,4,6304077912,I've seen this movie last year because i never had a chance to see it. I remember when this movie came out since i was 10 years old! I mean I always like Run D.M.C. Just like I like the Fat Boys. Now I have finally receive the movie on amazon. I have got the fat boys movie and this movie to. Both of them are a great collection. They have release that fat boys movie on DVD. So they need to release this movie on DVD as well. Thanks Amazon!,1238889600,,441,3.857142857142857
7860888,5,6304077912,"I haven't seen the movie in a long time, but I rememember enjoying it though. I give it 5 stars for the simple fact that it has Run DMC and the Beastie Boys in it!

However the main purpose of this review is to hope that somebody from the studio, that owns the right to this film, would take notice and release it on DVD. I don't even own a VCR anymore. I REALLY WANT THIS MOVIE IN MY COLLECTION ON DVD!!!",1187568000,6,405,3.9390243902439024
7860889,1,6304077912,"Spike Lee turned down this script.... That says it all. But I still wish it would be released on DVD. I think it's still a Hip Hop historical piece  from that era. Shame it only grossed less than a million. Probably cost a million to produce though. They should have promoted this a little bit more. I recall reading about significant delays with this movie being released and problems on the set with Rick Rubin. It should have been a better movie with the caliber of rap stars they had. But by 1988 Run-DMC's fame was wading and their careers were starting to fade out a little in the late '80s. Nowadays, 50 cent gets a 30 million dollar movie budget and top notch promotion on all these shows and magazines. They could have done a little better with this one.",1163548800,,763,4.411347517730497
7860890,4,6304077912,"YO!  So this movie might not have all the intellectual smarts of most crime movies, but it's not supposed to.  This movie is just a fun, hip-hop flick.  DMC is ill in this movie (""it's empty...like your future"") I'm saying, it not the best acting, or even story, but if you take it for what it was, a bunch of young guys making the movie that they wanted to make, and having fun, you can enjoy it.  Plus the fact that it has 2 dope performances by RUN DMC, a good lill bit of Slick Rick, and those zany Beasties, you'll like it.  Some people say that this movie was made when RUN DMC was falling off, but on the contrary, their style of rap will never be obsolete, they are the essence of what hip hop is supposed to be.  Watching the mellow DMC play off the hyped rap style of Run is just plain fun, and you can't front on that.",1137628800,,829,4.0552147239263805
7860891,4,6304077912,"This is a pretty bad movie, the acting is decent, at best. The plot is thin, the budget looked to be about nill.  But, there is something about ""Tougher Then Leather"" maybe it was because I grew up lovin' Run-DMC, I'm not sure.  This movie does deserve a lot of credit though.  It's the first movie I remember seeing, that had tons of cameos from rappers, and wasn't a movie about rapping.  This came out way before Who's The Man or any of the newer flicks that have rappers in them, just to sell tickets.  It was strange to see Run & DMC acting so hard.  But for all those who dislike that fact, remember this is a movie and they are ""acting""  They didn't train for this like Em did in 8-Mile.  It's a low budget ""gangsta"" flick.  I think when you consider the time period it came out, it's actually a pretty decent picture. They didn't set out to make something that would win an Oscar, or anything like that.  Watch this movie, sit back and be entertained.  And peep all the cameos, there are a lot of guest star emcees to be found here. And even ""Rick Ruben"" himself.",1058745600,,1071,4.252475247524752
7860892,1,6304077912,"I usually don't agree with Leonard Maltin, but he got it right with the witty line that I used to title this review.
Run DMC sold out big time with this one. The loveable heroes of rap of the 80s who kept rap from dying out in 1983 come off as crude gangsters who go on a revenge binge after the killing of their roadie Runny Ray. Blood and guts galore, foreshadowing the gagster rappers.
Low-grade garbage indeed. This video is great on a cold day when your fireplace is low. The DVD is also excellent for target practice on the rifle range.",1031097600,2,542,4.271844660194175
