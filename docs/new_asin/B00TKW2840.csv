8702168,5,B00TKW2840,"The Ring Of Honor Championship was vacant for the first time in the history of the company due to the injury suffered by Jay Briscoe setting up a 16 man tournament with ROH not only having their current talent but also names from the past along with international talent in this tournament which continued here at ""All Star Extravaganza V"" with this show concluding the opening round & beginning the quarter finals of the tournament.

Adam Page vs. Kushida - This was Kushida's Ring Of Honor debut coming from New Japan Pro Wrestling & should be noted that he was trained by former WWE/ECW talent Tajiri which was shown with Kushida going as a fast pace using various styles of kicks & going aerial along with some offense that was a page out of his trainer's own playbook causing Page to attempt to slow the pace down grounding him along with using some athleticism of his own such as a standing shooting star press.

Tomasso Ciampa vs. Silas Young - You saw the direction this match was going in the opening minute as both men went face to face & had such an aggressive tie up that they went through the ropes to the floor slamming each other against the guardrail still tied up before going into their own versions of ground & pound as they continued to pound on each other in different ways from pulling away at facial hair to suplexing one off the apron to the floor to a full nelson suplex as they continued to go back & forth with hard hitting strikes & impacful offense in what was nothing less than a physical & aggressive match from start to finish.

B.J. Whitmer vs. Michael Bennett - Whitmer took it to Bennett early on with an exploder suplex & suicide dive causing Bennett to not only showing some athleticism executing a very high vertical leap on the floor to deliver a dropkick to the ring from the floor & using the ringside environment to his advantage before slowing down the pace as they continued to trade fist & have the same idea in mind at different times as Bennett kept trying to take shortcuts including Maria at ringside causing someone else getting physically involved (and having the time of his life doing so) with the big story of this match being not only who won & how he did but the long term effects this match had.

Roderick Strong vs. Matt Taven - The current member of the House Of Truth against the original member with Nigel McGuninness enforcing that Hoopla Hottie Scarlet had to sit next to him at ringside as Stong came out hitting hard with his trademark chops & backbreaker causing Taven to take shortcuts along with showcase some athleticism such as a corkscrew senton as they continued to trade momentum with Strong continuing to deliver some strong (no pun intended) offense such as a bow & arrow slam along with his diverse backbreakers & submissions while Taven continued to try to use his athleticism & aerial offense plus desperate tactics including the House Of Truth at ringside.

Michael Elgin vs. Paul London - Elgin had the hometown advantage here as London used his superior speed advantage to keep catching Elgin off guard & used his own momentum against him while Elgin was able to use his strength advantage such as a shoulderblock that turned London inside out & catching him in mid-air along with just powering London down before both men attempted to use the same strategy of grounding their opponent to take away their superior advantage as they continued to go back & forth with London going aerial from the top & over the top plus springboard positions along with using a famous boxing strategy at one point while Elgin continued to use his power to either beat on or toss London around along with showing some athleticism of his own in what was a match of ""speed vs. power.""

A.C.H. & Tadarius Thomas vs. Caprice Coleman & Cedric Alexander vs. Young Bucks - Each team had the same strategy at times weather it was having a ""superkick party"" or using various double team offense taking out one or both opposing teams at the same time while each team also having different strategies weather it was working over a team both individually or playing a game of ""can you top this"" in a match full of non-stop action from start to finish.

Kevin Steen vs. Brian Kendrick - Both men were evenly matched with the same strategy in the early moments before Steen was able to get the advantage & having some fun at Kendrick's expense causing him to use a strategy of that worked to his advantage using diverse offense such as Slice Bread #2 on the apron & a camel clutch sleeper variation as Steen continued to use his superior size & power along with attempts at submissions while Kendrick showcased power of his own as part of his diverse style.

Adam Cole vs. Jay Lethal - This first match of the quarter finals with both men very evenly matched early using the same offense while having pinfall attempts & reversals against each other before each focused on a body part with Lethal targeting the back along with going aerial while Cole went after the neck with different neckbreakers & grounding him with a rear chinlock as they continued to go back & forth trading offense against each from kicks to counters to pin attempts using their signature offense resulting in a back & forth match.

ROH Tag Team Champions Forever Hooligans vs. American Wolves - Nigel McGuninness made it clear that there would be more emphasis put on the tag team division resulting in the Hooligans actually winning the tag titles a short time before setting up this match with each other as Rocky Romero & Davey Richards were playing mind games with each other based off their past history before the Hooligans attempted with isolate one of their opponents keeping them on the ground in their half of the ring while also working both at the same time such as dual submissions only for the Wolves to use the same strategy using isolation & double teaming along with submissions with Davey getting more of an attitude not only towards the Hooligans but also the canadian audience to the point where even Eddie was questioning what he was doing at times as both teams traded momentum with different counters & reversals while continuing to use double team tactics & taking advantage of miscommunications between partners before a team finally used a strategy of divide & conquer to finally get the victory in a very competitive match.

This was a very high quality event with each match showcasing different wrestling styles & levels of competitiveness along with the different levels of talent not just from Ring Of Honor that I can't help but recommend.",1425945600,,6593,4.651502145922747
