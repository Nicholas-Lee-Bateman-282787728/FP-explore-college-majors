1465396,4,B00005JKMW,"I saw this movie opening night and I had a great time. I haven't laughed so hard in quite awhile. I love spoofs and I loved Not Another Teen Movie. Unfortunately it loses some steam towards the end but overall it was still hilarious. It was a great time at the movies. If you want to see a movie that's just plain ""FUN"" then I'd recommend this. Basically if you liked Scary Movie you'll enjoy Not Another Teen Movie. Definately see this one in theaters, it's more fun that way. I saw it in a packed theater and I had a blast. The whole theater was cracking up laughing and so was I, it was just a lot of fun. If you want to laugh, Not Another Teen Movie would be your best bet.
Grade: 7/10 (It doesn't get full credit because it lost some steam towards the end) (...)",1008633600,4,767,4.12
1465397,1,B00005JKMW,"OK,teen movies may be packed with cliques and are often cheesy,but do they really deserve to get such a dismal parody
(a precussor to the Wanyes Brothers' ""Scary Movie"" franchise)
that is packed with cliques and are often cheesy-just like the
flicks that they call themselves making fun of?
 ""Bring In On"",""American Pie"",""She's All That"",and even a
classic like ""The Breakfast Club"",among many others,get roasted
in ""Not Another Teen Movie"" but mostly to tired,chidlish gags.
 If you want to paraody a cheesy film gerne,fine. But what's the
point of parodying it if you're parody revels in the bad traits that make the cheesy film gerne,cheesy.
So all in all:NOT ANOTHER TIRED PARODY!",1008633600,3,684,5.098214285714286
1465398,5,B00005JKMW,"This is the most hilarious movie i've probably ever seen. Way better than scary movie 1 or 2. I did not stop laughing after the first scene till the end of the movie. If the comedy wasn't enough the movie is full of topless scenes, definate 5 in my opinion.",1008374400,3,257,4.16
1465399,4,B00005JKMW,"This movie I thought was a a little bit better than Scary Movie. I rated this item a four because some scenes were just to unbelievable and it doesn't really keep you laughing all the time. It has a sick sense of humor. The toilet scene of the girl was nasty. I hated that. It made me laugh, but it was gross. Chris Evans(the jock) had some good parts, but he said and did some really shocking things and things he said was quite shocking. Which I will not mention. The cruelest girl which is The jock's sister was funny, but the kissing scene was gross. I thought the girl on the cheerleading squad with terrets was really funny. The characters all did a good job. The dildo scene in the beginning with the Stupid Ugly Girl was funny, but it was put in a nasty way too. I wish or hope they make a sequel with all the same characters. The movie all I can say was really funny and shocking at the same time. I can't wait though when it comes out on DVD!",1008374400,,952,4.123655913978495

Granted, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because of a few cheesy parts, but for the most part, it's damn good.  Worth watching more than once.

1465401,1,B00005JKMW,"I honestly thought this movie would be funny and make fun of teen movies based on the title.  It took what would have been a great idea, and made another teen movie.  It seems like an ""American Pie"" wanna be or something.  All of its good jokes were shown in the previews.  It was very boring and very unoriginal.  I saw it in a huge theatre and there were hardly any laughs- I think this movie could only be enjoyed by ten year olds.  If I was ten it would probably have been very funny.",1008288000,3,488,4.08421052631579

1465460,4,B00005JKMW,"Aside from the Zucker brothers Naked Gun movies, Airplane, etc., very few filmmakers have been able to pull of the spoof film with effective results. Not Another Teen Movie is an example of spoof done right on every level. Systematically lampooning the hot teen comedies from the late 90's into 2000 with a light sprinkling of 80's teen comedy tropes, the writers hit the nail on the head and created a genuinely funny movie. I think another strength of the film is the performances. Sometimes with spoof movies, the actors play the characters way too on the nose and it has terrible results. Not Another Teen Movie actually boasts a very talented cast that hits all the beats. Definitely a fun movie worth watching that delivers in the laugh department.",1507766400,2,754,4.8076923076923075

Sure, the concept isn't new: spoof a certain genre of movie, or even a certain movie in particular (see: the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, etc.), but ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is a spoof movie that's actually worth your while. (By the way, I found only one of the ""Scary Movie""s to be actually worth watching... I'm just saying).

I am a child of the 80's so I enjoyed the jokes on all the Brat Pack movies and even the newer teen movies I wasn't as familiar with.  I don't usually go for silly movies like Naked Gun, but this was a clever and offensive movie, which is my thing.

1466188,4,B00005JKMW,"Back when `Scary Movie' made a ton of money and convinced the world that spoofing popular movie trends would be a good idea, `Not Another Teen Movie' was born.  Now, enough time has gone by to prove to the world that the `spoofing' became a trend all its own and dove off the cliff of `fun and interesting' and crash landed on `ridiculous and unnecessary' but there is no denying that in the beginning it was all fun and games.  `Not Another Teen Movie' is basically another teen movie, with all the same elements of every other teen movie, just an added layer of `gross' to make it a spoof.  Taking a stab at every Freddie Prince Jr. movie as well as Cruel Intentions and those popular 80's teen flicks, `Not Another Teen Movie' tends to go too far in its attempt to be clever, but when it hits it's mark it does so with a memorable amount of charm.  The most memorable part of this film may be Cerina Vincent's character, the oft naked Areola (foreign exchange student bless from the gods with perky breasts capable of welcoming little cartoon birds to perch), but shameless nudity aside, there are many moments in `Not Another Teen Movie' where you will laugh, so for that very reason you should check it out.",1304035200,2,1212,4.470588235294118
1466189,4,B00005JKMW,"I know I'm not supposed to like this film. Half of the time I found myself laughing when I shouldn't have. The other half I'm not sure about. Was I amused by Not Another Teen Movie's stupidity? Or was this actually a clever sendup of recent and eighties teen movies alike?

  What this movie does the best is its purposefully archetypical characters. There's the popular jock, the ugly/pretty girl, the cocky blonde guy, the fat stupid guy, the nasty cheerleader, the token black guy, and many other on-target stereotypes of clich&eacute;d characters that have plagued teen movies for the last twenty years, some being stereotypes of high school roles in general (any many that have been used in multiple movies since Not Another Teen Movie was released).

  There's also lots of clich&eacute;s being parodied, often spoken in a serious but comical way by the characters. The prom dance scene got a laugh from me when one student said to the other, ""I never would've thought that everyone in the room would happen to be a professional dancer.""

  Now the popular jock I mentioned earlier, Jake, makes a bet with his friend Austin (The cocky blonde guy) that he can turn any girl in their school into prom queen, a la She's All That. ""Looks like Jakey-Wakey's about to make a little...mistakey!"" Austin taunts. They find the ugly, rebellious girl, but Jake attempts to turn her in to a beautiful prom queen, and you can guess where that goes.

  Not Another Teen Movie might not be well filmed or setup, but it has everything else. The actors are perfect (watch the nasty cheerleader's facial expressions closely), many of the one-liners are memorable (and quotable), the gags are stupid but hilarious, and the movie even has a funny musical number. Forget about what the other critics said; this movie has more than enough laughs in 82 minutes for an accurate parody of teen movies.",1287446400,,1882,4.8105590062111805

1466193,5,B00005JKMW,"A spoof compilation that plays out like a John Hughes wet dream, Not Another Teen Movie successfully takes a shot at nearly every teen movie ever made.  Hilarious from top to bottom, the list of parodied movies and ridiculous subplots reads off like the MTV movie Awards threw up pure awesome.

Jake Wyler (Chris Evans), the rich playboy, most popular guy at John Hughes High is dumped by Priscilla (Jaime Pressly), the head cheerleader [She's All That], for an oddball, artsy loner who has an affinity for filming grocery bags floating in the wind [American Beauty].  As a result, Austin (Olsen), the cocky, rich guy, bets Jake that his rock-star popularity couldn't help him turn just any girl at school into the Prom Queen [She's All That].  Naturally, Austin bypasses the afro-toting albino, the hunchback, and the conjoined twins connected at the head for Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh), the completely gorgeous but unpopular girl who is overlooked because she has on glasses and paint-covered overalls - also known as the teen movie version of Superman's disguise [She's All That].

Meanwhile, Janey's childhood friend Ricky Lipman (Eric Jungmann) - a social leper who dresses like he's colorblind - is completely in love with Janey [Pretty In Pink], who barely notices him.  Similarly (not really), Jake's drug abusing, whore of a sister Catherine (Mia Kirshner) injects herself in the same bet that Jake believes he can't win [Cruel Intentions].

The references come non-stop thereafter.  Football sequences hit on Lucas, Bring It On, Varsity Blues (and maybe a bit of Necessary Roughness).  There's a hilarious singing montage that is straight out of Grease.  A wild party that's part Ferris Bueller's Day Off and part Risky Business.  And consistent references to The Breakfast Club, including a great recreation of the library scene.  There is even a reappearance of 80s teen queen Molly Ringwold in what we can clearly call the late larval stage of her development, years before the current hot mess that we can only hope is followed by a fourth stage of her metamorphosis, which, in Hollywood, is commonly called plastic surgery.

Even if you don't like these movies, the incredible cast of Lacey Chabert, Chyler Leigh, Jaime Pressly, Cerina Vincent, and Mia Kirshner makes it worthwhile.

Noteworthy Extras:

 This claims to be ""Not Another Teen Movie"", but it really couldn't be anything BUT another teen movie. Made to appeal to those who were sickened by cheesy pop romantic comedies like 10 things I hate about you and She's All That, it takes a huge truckload of potty humor and sex jokes that teens would like and throws AS MANY OF THEM AS IT CAN at you over the course of the movie. It's simply on the other side of the ""teen"" spectrum, banking on all the other teen movies to fuel its own popularity.

 While I did enjoy the cute little references to 80s movies thrown in here and there, most of the movie was just boring and unfunny parodies. In fact, the movie suffers from the same problems that all of the [Genre movies that followed it have. They basically took everything that's currently popular, so that it would be easy to get, and put a sex/drug/gross-out spin on it. That's pretty much it.

 I wouldn't say this movie is great, but it does have its appeal to some people.

1466341,3,B00005JKMW,"OK, I watched this movie with my 74 year old father and brother-- motley crew, I admit.  I was a bit concerned, because the movie is pretty raw--- but my dad couldn't stop laughing at the opening scene--- the ""Ameican Pie"" send-up.  He was laughing the type of laugh where you shoot snot out of your nose and can't breathe and your gut starts hurting.  THAT is how funny the first scene in the movie is!  (You can thank the absolutely brilliant Chyler Leigh for her pitch-perfect performance.)

Now, it's not quite the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie---I think the vomiting puppet scene in ""Team America"" would have to earn that glowing distinction--- but it's still darn funny.

Unfortunately, that being said, the rest of the film is just sort of average-- notwithstanding two other scenes of almost equal hilarity. (In order to keep it clean, I'll just call these ""The Staircase Scene"" and ""The Toilet Scene."")

The scene at the end of the movie with Molly Ringwald is also priceless--- but the stuff in the middle is rather bland, tries too hard, has really disturbing bits that are trying to be funny in a gross-out way but are really just gross (like the girl wanting to have sex with her brother, eviscerating a retarded boy, and having a kissing scene between a 19 year old and a 75 year old), and uses really raw langange in the worst possible way (that is, not FUNNY, but rather just ARBITRARY and distracting).

This was a great movie. I enjoyed it immensly, when I first watched it on DVD. The reason I bought it on PSP, is my kids are getting older, and I'm trying to avoid watching R Rated movies in front of them.  For this, the PSP is PERFECT!  I can skip my cake and eat it too!  (I just made that up.)

Some of my favorite stereotypes of Highschool are in this movie.  It's funny to see the perspective of each ""clique"" or cliche.  I think the Nasty cheerleader is a little over the top (most were pretty nice in my highschool days) but its funny to see it played out.  I also enjoyed the ""beautifully weird"" side boyfriend, who likes to film sex acts, and other strange behavior.  The perky Foreign Exchange student was cool, and sexy to watch.  Funny how being in a foreign country lowers the inhibitions of some?

I've actually seen a few of the movies this movie parodies, AFTER I watched this movie, and I laugh when I think back to the exagerated scene that this movie ""re-created.""  LOL. I'm curious if anyone else did that?

I sure wish UMD's would include extras like DVD's.  I know of many items on the DVD that are not included here.  As a matter of fact, I can't recall that any extras were included.  4 stars for that.  I did notice some ""extra"" timed scenes that were part of bigger scenes.  I'm sure this is the ""unrated"" portion.  Again, its not fair to use words like ""unrated"" for extra scenes.  This only implys it is more raunchy than the ""rated"" version, and this is not being honest to consumers. Shame on those responsible.

Where this movie falls apart, and where do I begin, is in its forced humor. Although there are many, and I do mean many, references to 80s teen movies, they rely on these references too heavily, and anything which is not a reference just falls flat. The over the top nature of the film seriously takes away from the potential of the humor. Many of the characters in the film, well, are just that; characters for the sake of being there and they just result in cluttering up the story, if you could even call it that. The soundtrack for the film, although the best part of it, is just way overdone. I doubt there is even 5 minutes of the film in which there is no music playing. They have to have background music for just about the entirety of every scene. This film tries, too hard, to be funny, and ends up falling flat due to throwing too much of what is not funny at the audience (apparently the filmmakers thought that gross and funny were interchangeable). Somewhere within all of this mess is a boy meets girl story about two characters that nobody gives a damn about anyway, and the rest is clutter, cameos, and 'what the hell' moments, all backed up by an overdone soundtrack to the point of making one's mind as numb as the minds of those responsible for this film.

The original cut  must have been a post-production nightmare as the editor found scene after scene that just didn't work but was forced to include one horrible segment after another just to build up the running time. The extended cut not only includes all the original cut's weak stuff but supplements it with the mega-garbage that was originally trimmed.  So save your money and stay with the cheaper and SHORTER version-you won't be missing anything worth viewing unless you want it to torture your friends.

To be completely fair this movie did not stand much of a chance. The teen movies they go after do not lend themselves to this treatment ('Can't Hardly Wait' is already satirical).

Instead of being clever, these filmmakers accomplish little more than recycling copycat material from a host of teen films they think they are skewering in a cool fashion.  You soon pick up on a lot of negative energy from the cast, they just don't seem to be getting much enjoyment from working with this material, there is no spontaneous merriment.

It is not a 'little' movie, Gallen had a large budget and assembled a professional crew who shot a technically (camera-audio-direction) sound film. But when your pre-production phase can't manage more than a few hundred regurgitated inside jokes and clueless dopey references that fly over the head of the targeted demographics, no amount of competent production talent can save the day.

A good way to make an objective assessment of a project like this is to imagine which of the participants would actually want this to be a part of their resume. Aside from the camera, audio, and wardrobe people it is a career breaker. A notable exception is Mia Kirshner, who was able to turn what is arguably the movie's worst role into a showcase of her considerable talent as actress. Her part (the incestuous mean girl) is poorly written and totally unfunny yet she finds a way to play it so it actually works. Talk about turning adversity into opportunity.

If watching Mia is not enough reason to sit through the film there is also Chyler Leigh and Jaime Pressly-even if their acting is average their decorative qualities are exceptional. One of the few continuing inside jokes that actually works is how Leigh's 'plain Janey' character in glasses and ponytail (referred to as 'the pretty ugly girl') is actually more beautiful than the glamorous beauty into which she is transformed. And Pressly's 'Bring It On' parody is simply the funniest (and cleverest) scene in the film as she denies stealing a cheer from the black girls and then leads the white girls in the stolen routine with words unchanged: 'We are the North Compton Wildcats, we're black and we know it, we shake our big booties and show it, we ain't white, we definitely ain't white!'

At 'John Hughes High School' (shot at same school as ""She's the One"") this direction-less parody plays on in the 'Anthony Michael Dining Hall' and on the field of 'Harry Dean Stadium' (these names are some of the funnier stuff). A bet is made on the metamorphosis of the ""Ugly Duckling Girl Who's Really a Babe Underneath"" (Chyler Leigh). Leigh has two especially funny scenes, one where she is frantically painting and another where her entire extended family blunders into her bedroom while she is using a vibrator (much like the zipper scene in 'What about Mary').

In the movie's second funniest scene, a naked foreign exchange student (based on Shannon Elizabeth's character in 'American Pie') speaks in her native language and the subtitles work their way around her breasts so as to NOT obscure her nipples.

1466387,3,B00005JKMW,"Overall notes of the new unrated cut vs the orginal DVD -

-I count 8 of the 18 deleted scenes were incorporated in this version- the rest are missing and not in extras either, as the 'deleted scenes' extra was not

included;

-as advertised there is 10-11 minutes of new footage not found anywhere on the original DVD;

-cast commentary is not available - most surely left off cause it wouldn't sync with this new, longer version of the movie;

-I believe all the Easter eggs are there- I know the Mia-old lady kissing scenes are there and Chyler's wedding proposal;

-all the other extras are there from the orignal DVD - the omissions are the deleted scenes and the cast commentary mentioned above;

-very nice DVD case design, and also new music and a new menu choice design at beginning of the DVD;

More detailed analysis:

1) The 8 deleted scenes incorporated:

areola and janey go to class;

the bbq;

janey's transformation (with Mia);

Jake and Father;

Ricky at Party;

Pillow fight;

bruce and areola at prom;

ricky at prom;

The Good:

-you get high-res versions of the above scenes never before available;

The Bad:

-is an absolute crime the other 10 were not not still included as extras- some of the best scenes on the orginal DVD;

2) Some notes on the extra 10-11 minutes:

a) Some scene additions or major length additions:

-Janey-Ricky scene in hallway discussing the prom;

-Mitch and friends at cafe discussing sex;

-Jake and Ricky meet at Janey's house when chasing her at the end;

-Footloose parody scene at the prom;

-some exta 'shower footage' of the girls Mitch and his friends are looking at through the vent;

-little extra footage at football game and at the major party scene;

b) you will notice all kinds of extra few second splices right from the beginning all through-out the movie- too many to mention them all but a few examples-

-early scene when they all arrive at school- extra footage of Priscilla walking down hall- exta footage of them all walking over 'fat guy'; an extra comment

by the guy who shows up 3-4 times in the movie and makes sarcastc remarks;

-girl having sex against window at school says '**** me harder' instead of 'love me harder' (Chyler Leigh's voice btw);

-Mia Kirsher sucks on her brother's hand in their 'bedroom scene';

-dozens more like above;

The Good:

If you're a NATM fanatic you'll enjoy the xtra shots/footage gernally;

The Bad:

-most of the xtra footage is completely forgettable and was edited for a reason;

Overall:

If you can only buy 1 DVD- I'd highly recommend the orginal- has all the 18 cut scenes which are generally superior to the added footage and has the good cast

commenatary. Also the original edited movie cut is better than this one. But if you're a fanatic or collector, I'm sure you'll want this version as well though - getting high-res versions of the 8 previously cut scenes is nice and a few of the added scenes are funny or sexy.",1122508800,20,2943,4.63495145631068
1466388,3,B00005JKMW,"I love this movie. This was one of the funniest movies that has come along in years. Raunchy and no holes barred humor that reminded me of the days when humor was limitless and UNCENSORED!!

So, last night when I saw that the UNRATED DVD was available, I pounced on it and watched it alongside the original DVD (on a seperate TV) to see what they added.

Well... they added quite a bit. About 10 minutes more. Yet, NONE of it deserved to be deemed UNRATED by any means. Just a couple of added scenes (nothing dirty or risky at all), and some extended scenes (again... nothing dirty or risky at all). Fluffy kinda scenes.

Actually... most were unimportant enough that they deserved to be cut from the original version.

BONUSES for buying the DVD... there are some new SPECIAL FEATURES... like 3 brand new behind the scenes featurettes that are kinda cool. Seeing the cast talk about the movie and seeing RON LESTER THIN!!!!!  WHOA!!!

Chyler's bedroom dance and her party dance aren't even included anywhere. On the previous DVD it was in the deleted scenes... it wasn't in the movie and there are no deleted scenes on this edition.

Don't get me wrong. It's still the same movie + some. But the DVD as a package is probably one of the WEAKEST UNRATED CUTS of a movie I've ever seen... maybe it's because they left all the dirty stuff in the original cut that they didn't have anything dirty to put back in???

I tried to no avail to get a coworker to watch this outrageous comedy with her 14 year-old daughter. Hell, I am certain it is the wrong movie for most parents to watch with their kids, but that didn't stop me from trying. Not Another Teen Movie is disgusting and beautiful all at the same time and most of all hilarious!!!!

Not Another Teen Movie is a parody of various teen flicks spanning from the 80s to the 90s. Sometimes the jokes are spot on funny, other times they fall flat, and sometimes they are even too gross for me. Rather than bore with an analysis of each movie being parodied I'll just mention a few scenes that sum up the movie in a nutshell.

The movie is about a Jock who makes a bet with his friends that he can make any girl into Prom Queen. They pick out a girl who is seemingly a tomboy but take off her glasses , overalls,  and let down her hair and she is quite a hottie. Sound Familiar??? Anyhow, one scene that is quite funny involves a particular singing sequence before the senior prom. The lyrics are so funny it will have you red in the face. The words are so raunchy I can't post them or my review would be deleted. I'll paraphrase that it includes a virgin getting some no matter what and a cook leaving special sauce in someone's French Toast. A joke that completely falls flat is one in which they make reference to Ferris Buellers Day Off. They flat out mention taking their parents antique Ferrari to the city to get some hookers. I did not find it too funny at all. In the gross out category there is a scene at a party when a hot young 20 something girl makes out with an old granny. It includes a disgusting wet kiss with a lot of spit involved. Where the hell was the editor? That scene sucked!!!!!!!!!! NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT!!!!!

Not Another Teen Movie could have been better with some more restraint in the overall gags but still is a very enjoyable experience. Despite its flaws it is certainly a memorable movie with its own distinct charm. Why not buy it?",1120089600,2,2134,4.300995024875622

There's tons of sleaze--but FUNNY; there's good old-fashioned teen flick nudity (given to us by the incredible ""talents"" of Cerena Vincent, who is nude THROUGHOUT the entire movie); and, believe it or not, there's actually a plot here that's pretty good, while still maintaining the constant slapstick/sleazy humor.  One of the funniest and most original things in the whole movie is the part of the cheerleader who has Turrette's Syndrome.  For those of you who don't know what that is, it's a disorder where a person cannot keep themselves from going into a cursing tirade.

There are numerous times in this movie that I could have been offended but the writers meant no malicious intent.  With regards to the comedy you are best to be a generation 'Y' kid as most of the humor is from the late 80s and up.

Hands down this movie deserves a fice star rating on the basis of its premise, a satirical humor.  It focused a lot on today's youth and silly human mating rituals...

My favorite part of this movie is the gentlemen who can never clap at the appropriate time and when given the opportunity to do so he failed miserably and beat some guy up who clapped first.  Just watch the movie, don't listen to the reviews except for this one!

The movie parodies many of these well know teen films: Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Risky Business, American Pie,Dead Poet's Society, and at least one other I can't remember.

The film runs through a high school year in a seemless week and reintroduces us to well known high school sterotypes, the jock, the teen virgins, ugly girl, the token black guy, the bitchy cheerleader, the excahnge student, the quiet, strange guy who video tapes his girl screwing a jock, and at least one 91020 take off.

The movie spoofs every 80's teen movie imaginable. The Breakfast Club scene in the library and the American Pie bedroom scene are classic. Even the little things like the 'Michael Anthony Hall' and 'Corn dogs to practice' are great.

  The best example is the satire of She's All That, where the school jock bets that he can turn the nerdiest girl in school into prom queen. Just like in She's All That, they choose a girl who is very attractive but wears glasses and a ponytail, as this that is enough to make someone the nerdiest girl in school!

Some cute references to teen comedies of the past do little to save this mess. This is a very lame attempt because every modern teen comedy has already become a spoof of the superior ones from the 80s.

1466522,5,B00005JKMW,"In ""Not Another Teen Film"", 2001, Chyler Leigh plays the role of Janey Briggs, a teenage high school student.  This flick roughly follows the story line of an earlier film ""She's All That"" (1999, which starred Rachael Leigh Cook as Laney Boggs).

Typical of the teen romance genre, the guys are historically depicted as raunchy characters, looking only for booze and sex, while the girls get to play the straight roles.

In  ""Not Another..."" those roles are reversed: The girls get to play the raunchy characters, while the guys play relatively straight roles!  An exception this rule is Janey's loving father: He plays a hopeless alcoholic, who enthusiastically encourages his daughter to have sex with Jake Wyler (played by Chris Evans) even though he is her first date.

I have to admit that the entire premise of the film is a bit shocking.  But it's certainly a wakeup call for producers of teen movies who indulge in too much stereotyping.  I might mention that the casting is excellent, comprised mostly of young new actors.  They did very well in their respective roles.  For instance, Lacey Chabert played the role of Amanda Becker, a confident teen who never uttered a word, but stole the show whenever she walked through a crowd of her peers.

 I really enjoyed it and found it a refreshing change.",1092096000,,1309,4.820627802690583
1466523,2,B00005JKMW,"I say this because it is really the only redeeming feature of this film.  Fortunately, the writers and directors decided to make it a recurring motif.  Every time the film starts to suck unbearably, Cerina Vincent shows up looking spectacular and we forget about what a piece of garbage we are watching.  Heck, even the two best jokes in the movie are derived from her nudity, one at a house party and the other involving subtitles.

The main problem with this flick is that it sends up what was already, in most cases, really funny comedy.  Hence, the spoof involves ratcheting it up several notches higher (often on the disgusting scale).  It usually winds up being less funny than the scene it is spoofing.  Or the jokes have already been played out (note to the creators, South Park already had a black kid named Token).  And in spite of being told Chyler Leigh is supposed to be unattractive due to her clothes, hair, and glasses, she never looks less than strikingly beautiful.  Incidentally, it is usually a bad sign when the commentary is funnier than the movie.

Let us think about this.  If you want to see a spoof, any Zucker, Abrams, or heck, even Wayans movie is better.  If you want a simple laugh, almost any comedy is consistently funnier.  If you want to see Cerina Vincent naked, well, I guess this is as good as it gets.  At least now you know why you are getting this movie and there is no denying it.",1090800000,2,1421,4.5

 Most of the movie is a parody of She's All That, although some 80s movies are slipped in, like Pretty In Pink, which I haven't seen, so I can't really compare. The other teen films they're spoofing (just about everything) include: Cinderella, Grease, Top Gun, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pulp Fiction, Clueless, The Craft, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, There's Something About Mary, Bride of Chucky The Faculty, Varsity Blues, Cruel Intentions, 10 Things I Hate About You, Never Been Kissed, American Pie, American Beauty, Road Trip, Scary Movie, Bring It On, Dude, Where's My Car?, Save the Last Dance (2001), Get Over It and probably loads more. (I can't think properly to name them all) But the prominent one is She's All That, with the names changed, but still similar.

 There's not many well known actors in this - I recognise the name Jamie Pressley from somewhere, but can't think where. The rest are actors trying to get their big break.

Sean Patrick Thomas appears, on the 'token black guy's' stomping ground, and promptly gets told where to go, and Melissa Joan Hart also appears for no apparent reason (that'll be the highlight of her career).

1466597,4,B00005JKMW,"Ah. Teen movies.
Having attended high school in early 1980s America, I always was amazed by the teen-movie genre, particularly John Hughes' Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, cute-but-angst-ridden comedy-dramas starring Molly Ringwald (who makes a cameo in this movie) and dealing with the social and love lives (or lack thereof) of teenagers.  I somehow never got around to seeing some of the raunchier teen movies (American Pie, She's All That) that Not Another Teen Movie spoofs, but nevertheless, even some of the classier Hughes' directed-or-produced flicks had at least some of the elements targeted by this Airplane!-styled parody.
In every teen movie I have seen there do exist such archetypes as ""The Obsessed Best Friend,"" ""The Stupid Fat Guy,"" ""The Popular Jock,"" ""The Token Black Guy,"" ""The Desperate Virgin"" (perhaps the one archetype most guys in high school can relate to), ""The Perfect Girl,"" ad infinitum and ad nauseam, and when such a trend of repetition appears (as it does in all genres), it becomes a ripe target for broad parody shots.
The plot is a blend of Cruel Intentions and She's All That, with elements of almost every recent teen movie tossed in for good measure. There is a slight central story revolving around a bet (can a ""Pretty Ugly Girl"" be transformed into the Prom Queen?), but there are many little vignettes tossed in by the five screenwriters involved. (Like all things written by committee, Not Another Teen Movie has a certain hit-and-miss quality to it, but the gags are often very funny, raunchy -- does that ""Foreign Exchange Student"" ever catch a cold from walking around nekkid all the time?  -- and even dead-on!)
The 2002 Columbia/TriStar Home Entertainment DVD comes loaded with extras that make this movie more enjoyable.  I particularly liked the Teen Movie Factoids track and the Test Your Teen Movie I.Q. test (I don't watch many of these puppies, so I didn't do so well...d'oh!)
As for the movie itself, while it's not quite in the same level as Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, I did find it enjoyable and funny.  In that, director Joel Gallen achieved his goal, and it made a quiet Saturday afternoon more mirthful.
(24 fans, take note: ""The Cruelest Girl"" in Not Another Teen Movie was played by Mia Kirshner, who is better known as the cold and deadly Mandy on Fox's 24)",1074297600,2,2343,4.909090909090909
1466598,4,B00005JKMW,"I finally decided to just sit down and watch this movie when it was on cable. I thought it would be pretty stupid so I didn't have any expectations for this movie, and boy was I suprised - I loved it!
Yeah, it is kind of stupid and overexaggerated, but that's what makes this movie so funny! It has parodys of so many different ""teen flicks"" including *She's All That*, *Pretty in Pink*, and *Can't Hardly Wait*, just to name a few. There are also a few cameos that make it that much better.

This is a movie that can make you laugh if you have the right mindset going in. A movie designed for parody or satire is designed to make you laugh. Some people want every movie to be on Golden Pond or Tombstone.
Just like if you attend a concert not caring for the music style being played, you will not enjoy it; so it is with this movie. Sit down, free your mind and just enjoy the gags. There are scenes that are exceptionally funny and some that I was less enthused about, but all in all I simply enjoyed the laughs and even some of the gross humor. You have stereotyped teen movie characters that are absaloute parodies of the genre but easily identified with the movie being parodied. Scenes that are just totally turned on their ear for laughs and moments that are just simply enjoyable. The movie does lose steam at the end but by then, if you enjoy gross parodies, you will be tired from laughing and are ready for the end of the movie.

1466601,4,B00005JKMW,"Speaking as a long-time fan of teen movies, I was quite impressed by the scope and quality of this motion picture.  I don't generally go for gross-out humor, but this film takes a slightly higher road than, say, Scary Movie, actually striving to encapsulate all of the bits and pieces of years of other movies into a coherent plot.  Sure, there are a few aspects of real raunchiness included here, with two scenes in particular being pretty disgusting, but the movie never sunk to the level of becoming distasteful to my eyes.  I also have to admire the verve with which the filmmakers went about their tasks; if you are going to do a full-fledged parody, I say don't hold back, and Not Another Teen Movie does not hold back at all, especially in terms of the language.  This movie is brash and unafraid, and that is a real factor in its success.
I was amazed by the vast number of movies that found themselves ridiculed and incorporated into this film; I was expecting send-ups of teen comedies from the past ten years, but this movie draws heavily from a number of classic 80s films and even snatches a few things from 1970 classics such as Grease.  Even a number of films I wouldn't consider teen movies (but which do feature teens) are pulled into this satirical universe - e.g., American Beauty.  This could almost be a weakness because today's teens may be unfamiliar with a lot of the parodies involved in this production; having come of age in the 80s, I easily spotted the references to classics such as Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, etc., but I wonder how many of today's teens pick up on little things such as the name of the high school (John Hughes High), understand the origins of a character such as Ricky, or see the significance of the prom dress Janey Briggs wears.  Of course, the most obvious nod to 80s teen movies comes in the form of Molly Ringwald's unusual cameo appearance and the impressive homage to The Breakfast Club, which I admit left me feeling a little older than I would like to be.  I think it is safe to say that those unfamiliar with teen movies of the last twenty years will get little enjoyment out of Not Another Teen Movie; you have to know the source of the parodies in order to really ""get"" them, and the mere task of trying to count the number of different movie reference can be a source of amusement in and of itself.
The DVD comes loaded with extras.  If you have only a limited knowledge of teen movies, you may want to start by taking the Teen Movie I.Q. Quiz; if you score less than 50% on the quiz, you would do well to bone up on your teen movie knowledge before taking the step of actually watching Not Another Teen Movie.  The list of additional special features, I must say, is legion: commentaries by both filmmakers and cast, 18 deleted scenes including the original ending, three behind-the-scenes featurettes, cast promos, an illuminating yearbook montage featuring the class of John Hughes High, a collection of cast member auditions, movie trailers, Meet the Cast promos, and a track of teen movie factoids.  But wait, there's even more.  First-time feature film director Joel Gallen's first short film is thrown into the mix, alongside a Behind the Video look at the unrated version of Marilyn Manson's Tainted Love video.  If you think the likes of Mia Kirshner, Chyler Leigh, and Jaime Pressly are hot in the movie (and I don't know how you could think otherwise), you really want to see this video.",1063497600,68,3493,4.596463022508039
1466602,4,B00005JKMW,"But there's some other good stuff here as well.  When a genre reaches its saturation point, nothing takes the piss out of it like a good satire, and ""Not Another Teen Movie"" fits that bill quite nicely.  Since teen movies are notorious for taking themselves way too seriously, it was inevitable that a movie was going to come along to do for the genre what ""Airplane"" did for disaster movies and ""The Naked Gun"" did for cop flicks.  Such a movie could every easily wind up being every bit as stupid as the targets it mocks, but fortunately ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is far funnier and more intelligent than it has any right to be.  Although it takes its plot loosely from the miserable ""She's All That,"" ""Not Another Teen Movie"" takes aim at virtually every overheated teen dramedy to hit it big in the past two decades or so.  Every few seconds, there's some inspired gag that slices and dices the more ridiculous elements of such movies as ""American Pie,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""Varsity Blues.""  The movie trots out every stock character possible, and deflates every pretentious genre clich in the book.  There's the pack of horny teens, the slow-motion entrances, the big high-school party, the geek in love with the beautiful girl, and of course the above-mentioned token black guy (who absolutely owns the movie in his limited screen time).  Even the gross-out gags are way funnier than they should be, because it's obvious that they're entirely tongue-in-cheek.  It also doesn't hurt that the cast includes two of the hottest women alive in Chyler Leigh and Mia Kirshner (not even to mention Jaime Pressley), or that Molly Ringwald and That Guy Who Played The Principal In ""The Breakfast Club"" are brought back for way-funny cameos.  And while I don't really know what exactly Mr. T was doing here, his appearance is still quite humorous.  The movie does lose a few points for having the horrible excuse for a band known as Good Charlotte playing at the high school prom, but it's not enough to bring it down.  If you're not above laughing at some admittedly sophomoric stuff, you should check this one out.",1061596800,8,2116,4.751366120218579

1466604,4,B00005JKMW,"With the barrage of truly tasteless, awful and thoroughly uninspiring teen movies that have flooded the market over the past two decades, it was only a matter of time before someone came up with the ultimate send off, slap-in-the-face spoof that would put the competition to shame.  And here is that movie, aptly titled, ""Not Another Teen Movie"".  From the onset we are treated to snippets and one liners that blatently criticize the teen market of mindless fluff.  Everything from ""Pretty in Pink"" to ""Never Been Kissed"" gets the ax and the chops are mercilessly funny.  Plot: threadbare at best, involves an ugly duckling who (no kidding) is transformed into a swan and wins the heart of the best looking guy in the school.  Stop me if you've heard this one before.  But plot is not what this movie is about.  Ripping into the past is and this film makes an understandible mockery of everything that has gone before it, wisely excluding John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" from its assault.
TRANSFER WISE: Columbia's given us a fairly solid transfer with bold, saturated colors, good fine detail, solid blacks and excellent contrast levels.  Though edge enhancement is apparent in several scenes and shimmering does come and go, pixelization is not present for a pretty smooth looking visual presentation.  The audio is 5.1 and nicely spread across all the channels.
EXTRAS: Deleted scenes (most adding nothing to the film), audio commentary, making-of featurettes and a music video.  Well done.
BOTTOM LINE: ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is gross-out comedy and, while I'm generally not in favor of shock value substituted for genuinely funny material, in this case - it works to illustrate just how bad all the other teen flicks have been that have gone before.

1466666,2,B00005JKMW,"This film to me is so godawful that you can't help but be entertained by it based on that merit alone. I've seen many teen comedies and spoofs, and it appears from looking at the overall average customer review for this film, many seem to applaud it a bit more than many other films of this caliber, including some of the films that this movie pokes fun at. I may be a party of one, or one of a short few that doesn't seem to agree with the apparent consensus, but I'll get to my reasons why later.
First off, it's obvious that this movie is one gigantic spoof that pokes fun at many teen films such as Can't Hardly Wait, She's All That, Varsity Blues and a ton of others, not to mention some rather vulgar shots at Broadway. If you've seen any or all of the aforementioned films, you'll be able to catch onto the humorous jabs. However, if you haven't seen any of the dozens of films that are being referenced here, you'll come away feeling like this film was one ridiculous, sloppy, corny, nonsensical waste.
However, what keeps me from enjoying this on a higher level is that while the jabs were obviously meant to be stupid and corny, the overall dialogue seems to be missing some kind of character, and the humor just seems very flat and insipid. Out of the entire movie, there were literally only one or two moments where I bust out laughing, while the other laughs seemed more like sarcastic and strained snickering. Perhaps it would have been a bit more to my liking if they cut a little bit more brutally into the jugular, like the Scary Movie series did, and while some may have cringed due to the ridiculously excessive amount of crude vulgarity found in the Scary Movie series, that trademark alone gave that series a bit of backbone, bite and character which couldn't be ignored. Here, none of that seems to be present, and the effort comes across like a weak rehash of past spoofs that leave much more to be desired. I suppose that youngsters who have had strict upbringing, and weren't permitted to watch obscene movies would bust a gut laughing if they saw this for the first time.
And perhaps, this is where all of the ironies are uncovered. The film is so silly, stupid, corny and overblown that you really CAN'T help but be charmed and entertained by it somewhat. While all of my dissatisfactions are listed above, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have somewhat ambivalent feelings, as I enjoyed it as sheer entertainment, but nothing more. Of course, this may have been what the writers were trying to aim for exactly - getting an ambivalent reaction out of viewers. Of course, this may have been the original tendency of the spoof genre in general. My rating for this is 2.5 stars, as I enjoy other comedies and spoofs more than this one (not to mention that I actually enjoy some of the movies they made fun of - She's All That, Can't Hardly Wait and Varsity Blues - better than this.) You may have a different reaction to this than I did, so give it a shot. It's entertaining to say the least.",1056672000,4,3015,4.444043321299639

1466668,3,B00005JKMW,"This is one of those movies where they compact every good and funny part (well mostly funny) and condense it in to the film commericals and trailers.
It really was a poorly written satire at teen movies of today, and can now join the collection of the new mock-a-movie movie which is becoming so popular.
It does have it's upsides though, with pokes at various movies which we love to hate; ""She's All That"" - but it does tend to over labour the joke, throughout the movie.
In all, it is really a give or take situation as to buying this movie. On one hand, it is great for playing in the background whilst working at your desk or doing homework. On the other, it can be a bit annoying, or even one of those movies where you take it out of the VCR (or DVD player!) within the first 15 minutes.
Rent it first!! You may like it. This should be floating around TBS Superstation soon, so you might catch it there. Having said that, TBS does tend to butcher and cut movies to fit in to time slots, family ratings and commerical time, so it probably won't give you an excellent idea about how funny or lame it is.

This movie will surely attain cult like status and be enjoyed long after the overrated films from 2001 have evaporated. I should mention 2001 was a very good year for movies to boot so Not Another Teen Comedy is in good company.
For sure it parodies and pokes and probes countless high school comedies from the recent and somewhat distant past. Spotting the influences would take too much time. But this cross pollination works for several reasons. Yeh the humor is broad but it is telling comedy. This flick and its over the top antics nails the high school culture experience right on the nose. The anxieties, futlities and clique horrors are all explored with wit and panache.
The cast is uniformally excellent as everyone embraces their ""stereotype"" with gusto. Mia Kirshner and Jamie Pressley are incredible in this film. Cudos to the director Gallen for keeping everything in perspective and percolating.
This movie just feels right from the start. Always in sync, Not Another Teen Movie, perhaps because of the R rating, raises the bar a notch in the teen comedy genre. This allows the director to push the envelope-particularly with Kirsner's character-but also allows breathing room and tension release for audiences who fully understand the awkward, dark, restless and flat out wierd experience that is high school. The lusts and thwarted desires are all in evidence here in spades.
And the Grease like musical moment before the prom is pure joy.
What a debut for Gallen.

Never in my life has a movie disgusted, bored, and insulted me like ""Not Another Teen Movie"" has... and I'm a teen! I see positive reviews for this movie and I'm shocked. People liked this movie? Enough to give it 5 stars? Have they seen other movies? Do they know what the word ""movie"" is? I'm asking because ""Not Another Teen Movie"" requires an intelligence so low, a brain so devoid of anything, and it still is not that great. Today's parodies are nothing like those of ""Airplane!"" times. These days, they must have a lot of gross sex jokes, absolutely no direction, and, according to this movie, excrement spraying at people in large amounts. I mean, movies like ""American Pie"" are great because they explore sex in a surprisingly innocent way. The sexual situations in those movies are gross, yes, but lighthearted and with the best intentions. NATM just wants to be dirty, offensive, and without a point. Parodies are supposed to bring to the audience's attention the way movies are ludicrous. They poke fun at scenes from movies, or tidbits of pop culture. NATM, in its quest to ultimately disgust and repulse the viewer, takes these familiar things, repeats them, then turns them into the nastiest joke it possibly can. This really is not another teen movie. It's a vile imitation with a huge lack of timing and the cruelest of intentions. To like this movie requires psychopathic tendencies.

They also spoof 90's movies and other recent teen films like: She's all That, Cruel Intentions, American Beauty, Bring it On, Varsity Blues, Never Been Kissed, American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait, and Ten things I Hate about You.
It pokes fun of the common stereotypical characters that you know and love from all those teen movies: The Jock, The Pretty Nerd, The horny geek virgin, The Hot foreign student and the Token Black Guy; just to name a few.

The movie's plot mostly centers on ""She's all That"": A jock gets dumped by his elitist girlfriend and in turn, he and his friends make a bet to transform the nerdiest girl into the next prom queen.

Some are disgusting, like the exploding toilet episode, some are distasteful, like the Siamese twins and the girl with Tourette Syndrome (a la Deuce Bigelow), and almost all are pretty stupid. One of the running gags involves a hard-bodied foreign exchange student who parades around in her birthday suit. If you can willingly suspend disbelief at this shameless exploitation and creative bankrupcy, then this movie is for you. That said, I found myself chuckling or even laughing out loud several times.
The plot loosely resolves around a rich, popular jock's attempt to turn a nerdy, unsociable ugly duckling into prom queen material, but plot is the last thing that matters in a movie such as this. There are plenty of bare bosoms and bottoms throughout to go with the coarse language, earning the movie an R-rating, which means that technically speaking most teens wouldn't be able to see it. Furthermore, not many teens nowadays would recognize references to movies made in the 80s. Nevertheless, it could be entertaining for those who do actually remember those John Hughes classics, provided you leave your finer sensibilities at the door.

- jock Jake, on the ""ugly pretty girl"".
""Not Another Teen Movie "" is a deeply split film. And that is reflected by the reviews. Some hate it, some love it. Me, I quite like it, oddly.
I actually found it interesting enough to listen to both of two commentary tracks, one from producer/director, and one from the cast. And this revealed what causes the twin personality of the film. Apparently when the director got offered the original script, he did not like it at all, because it was all one big gross-out joke with no story. So he turned it down. But they really wanted him, and so he asked them that a writer he knows could work over the script.
And it got worked over so thoroughly that the finished film apparently basically only has one scene that was in the original script. And it happens that this scene is also the one that clearly is the big gratuitous gross-out scene in the film. It is doubtlessly a scene that many modern teens will find hilarious. And very tellingly, it is also a scene that neither director/producor or the cast like at all! They would clearly rather have been without it at all, but kept it for box-office reasons. (What scene it is? Let us just say that it involves a toilet and hundreds of liters of chocolate sirup!)
Also interestingly, the original script only had parody of films from the nineties. But the producers wanted to give it more breadth and more heart, and to include lots of story from famous eighties teen movies, like Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, etc. (They even have Molly Ringwald appear in the end.)
One of the best things it has is female lead Chyler Leigh. Here is a prediction: she is going to be big, you read it here first. Chyler is very pretty indeed, and she is an excellent actor, and even an excellent dancer, as can be seen on the DVD extras. She has a gorgeous smile, and she can also be very funny, as is seen for instance in the opening scene where she is caught by her family with a vibrator in her bed. The faces she pull trying to tone down her ecstasy are priceless.
Another good thing is of course the ""object of lust"" as she herself puts it, the ""generic foreign exchange student"", Areola, who is never dressed. She is unfortunately only in the film a couple of times, and briefly. I guess because the nudity is ""gratuitous"". Can somebody tell me why, when you put nice landscapes in a film (example: the beautiful Straight Story by David Lynch) it is not gratuitous, but if you put a beautiful nude person in, it is?
They all clearly worked very hard on this film, and I think it does show. It is often crude, but it is also sometimes very funny indeed. And it has some very nice girls. I would quite like to have seen the film as it would have been if they had not needed the contemporary teen audience for box office. But even so, if you are not adverse to a teen comedy, I recommend it.

1466741,3,B00005JKMW,"""Not Another Teen Movie"" is certainly worth the rental price.  I must admit, the commercials for it when it was originally released made it look pretty bad...which was why I avoided watching it for so long until a friend cajoled me into it.
Anyhoo, I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw.  True, some of the jokes are unbelieveably tasteless.  Jokes concerning people getting sprayed with human excrement, incest, and Tourette's syndrome are pretty bad, admittedly, and aren't the movie's strong point.  Plus, the ""Breakfast Club"" homage and Molly Ringwald cameo are actually kind of lame.
However, where this flick succeeds is in its relatively quieter moments:  when it cuts through all the smarmy, romantic cliches of the American teen film genre.  The ""Varsity Blues"" parody has to be the best scene in the movie topped off by Ed Lauter's hilarious performance as the ridiculously angry coach.  Other favorite moments of mine is when the Popular Jock (in order to impress the Pretty Ugly Girl) saves her bratty younger brother from getting his ... kicked, and then ends up beating [up]the kid anyway; and the entire sequence when the aforementioned jock rushes to the airport to tell said girl (who is leaving for Paris) that he loves her.  Oh yeah!  And there's a pretty nifty musical number too!
Obviously, I'm not doing these scenes a whole lot of justice by barfing them back to you via Internet, but I'm doing my best, OK?!?!
Anyhoo, I'm not sure whether or not you should actually *BUY* this flick, but it's definitely worth a few laffs for a slow evening's entertainment.
Plus, if gratuitously nudity is what you look for in a movie, this one's got tons of it.

Only one such as he could summon the courage and tenacity to hold a steadfast gaze into the dark heart of the soul-crushing Hollywood machine. One that exploits our nation's youth and forces them to conform to pre-digested stereotypes such as jocks, sluts, and nerds. Our young deserve better! Kudos to these talented filmakers for bringing to light and satirizing the hackneyed and uninspired tropes of the ""Teen Film"" genre. Without this film and its peerless insights, we would never know how silly teenage comedic sex romp films truly are. This stunning revelation has forever altered the course of human history. I eagerly await this production team's next endeavor, and will gladly reserve a space on my shelf next to the films of Kubrick, Welles, Scorsese, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, and Hitchcock for the complete works of the esteemed Mr. Gallen.",1045180800,2,964,5.069182389937107

However, for those of us who were raised on ""teen movies"" (from Sixteen Candles through the latest glut of knock-offs), it's like a low-brow game of trivial pursuit. It's fun just to sit back and try to catch all the references, as well as try to peg the oh-so-familiar songs.

The entire cast is absolutely horrible, once again proving that as long as you have a pretty face you don't need to have a teaspoon's worth of talent to be in the movies.

After the immense success of ""Scary Movie"" and ""Scary Movie 2"", you knew the only other recent film trend to be spoofed beside teen slasher films were teen high school comedies. It seems to be a perfect target for spoofing. This movie could of been a real fun ride, and at times it is, but it fails in some places and the jokes feel flat and routine. However, it's a pleasant enough distraction for 90 minutes, and the film does have a decent share of good chuckles. Not to mention some nice looking females to look at. The plot, if you can call it that, is pretty much following the ""She's All That"" formula. The cool, high school king is given a bet by his loser friends to change some poor, unattractive girl st school into a knockout and win homecoming queen. Nothing fresh or new there. Of course, the girl in question is, quite obviously, a pretty girl already!. That's one of the jokes in here. How the nerdy, loser girl that is supposed to be transformed into a beauty is already a beauty to begin with. The girl, Jaynie Briggs, is played by lovely and pretty Chyler Leigh(""Safe Harbor"", ""Girls Club""), and she is nice to watch. Everyone else is going thru the motions. The other characters are all forms of characters from teen movies. You got the geeky guy who longs after the girl, The token black guy that's there to have some funny comment, the popular and pretty girl that's just a huge witch, the nerdy geeks looking to score, and the football coach who yells and screams and throws his clipboard down. They are all here. While many recent films like ""Bring It On"", ""Never Been Kissed"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""Varsity Blues"", ""American Pie"", and ""American Beauty"" are spoofed, many older ones like ""Better Off Dead"", ""Risky Business"", ""Pretty In Pink"", and the John Hughes collection get the parody treatment as well. There are even some pretty good cameos in here from Paul Gleason, who played the principal in ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Sabrina"" star Melissa Joan Hart, and the teen queen herself, Molly Ringwald. In fact, Molly's small part is the best part of the film. The humor is pretty much what you expected to be. Lowbrow comedy that hits it on the mark every once in a while, but misses more often than not. Silly, juvenile humor is okay every once in a while, but it gets really old and monotonous after a period of time as well. The jokes here are nothing new and the overall film doesn't add anything different to the cluttered cannon of teen films and spoof films. Randy Quaid, Jaime Pressley, and former ""Party Of Five"" co-star Lacey Chabert also appear. Ignore the one star review below. A pile of whatever he says could come from anyone and anywhere.

Unfortunatly, Not Another Teen Movie ends up being just as immature and mindless as the films it is trying to make fun of.  On the one hand, the writers should be commended for at least doing their homework and they manage to pick out many of the worst parts from the various films.  It's obvious that they studied these movies quite a bit which is a grueling task to say the least.  Unfortunatly, when the mockary comes, it useually ends up simply being toliet humor.

It pokes fun at almost every single teen movie released in the past 4 years, and managed to spoof some from the 80s as well. The film takes the basic storyline of She's All That, and moves on from there introducing each one of the characters. Each taken from different movies with combinations of its characters. The most entertaining - to me - was The Cruelest Girl based on Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn from Cruel Intentions and the trio of desperate virgins based mainly on the American Pie guys. And kudos to the casting team for getting Molly Ringwald to set our two leads straight in the end! In accordance with my positive notes, I do have one negative. I didn't really expect the film to have an even plot, but there were a few plot holes that just lingered and never were covered up. But who really cares in a movie like this?

Even Reggie Ray).

1466859,2,B00005JKMW,"With the huge success of 'Scary Movie', it was inevitable that another spoof would arrive on our doorsteps that lampooned teen films.  It borrows diversely from a range of such tired flicks, such as 'She's All That', 'Varsity Blues', 'American Pie', 'Cruel Intentions' and oddly enough even 'American Beauty'.  The main story is taken from 'She's All That', with a jock trying to help a misfit win Homecoming Queen.  Unfortunately it's all a little bit disjointed, with seemingly unrelated scenes following on from each other in the same style that made 'Scary Movie' so unfunny.  For instance, the lesbian kiss scene from 'Cruel Intentions' seems completely out-of-place and serves nothing to the story.  Okay, so perhaps story wasn't the first thing on the mind of the director but some kind of coherance would have been nice.
However, it does manage to win a few laughs, not least in it's admitedly very impressive realisation of teen movie clichs.  For instance, the makeover scene, where taking off the character's glasses and letting her hair down immediately transform her into a striking beauty is great, as is the character constantly signposted as a token black guy.  This kind of subversion is few and far between though, in a movie that regretably doesn't break the mould in its constant barrage of crude jokes involving masturbation and bodily functions.  Whilst definitely better than 'Scary Movie' and 'She's All That', it's perhaps a little galling to have something so tasteless riffing off the much superior 'American Beauty'.  Obviously some thought went into this, especially in the scenes mentioned above, but it seems as though the director got scared at the last minute and tried to extract any originality out of it to make way for dumb jokes.",1036454400,2,1767,5.0446735395189

If one wanted to make a case that Molly Ringwald is washed up as an actress, one could find lots of support for that in her cliched ranting in her cameo toward the end.",1031184000,31,589,4.728155339805825
1466921,3,B00005JKMW,"Wait! Stop for a second!.Are you aware that this is a teen spoof/parody comedy?, it's not an Oscar nomination movie. No!! Not at all!.That's why you shoul review this film by the jokes and ideas and not the plot or if it's stupid or not. If you didn't like `Scary Movie', you won't enjoy this one at all.
It's a superficial plot, full of gags and surprises that were really funny.
Movies like `Shrek',`Shriek if you know what you did last Friday the 13th', `Naked gun' or even `Scary Movie 2' are parodies. What does that mean?, a movie that makes funny of other films.
This one makes funny of a bunch of old and new teen movies, like
`She's all that', `Jawbreaker', `Varsity Blues',`American Pie', `Can't hardly wait',`Bring it on',`16 candles', `The breakfast club',`Cruel Intentions',`Grease',`Almoust famous',`American beauty', `Never been kissed',`Save the last dance' and a lot more.
The plot: Like I said, the plot in this movies are senseless, but this one was aceptable.
Jake just broke up with Priscilla, so he and his friends make a bet about him, dating the uglyest girl in school for the prom and make her the Prom Queen.
So now Jake is dating Janey, the ugly pretty girl. But his sister Catherine, wants to have sex with him, and her best friend is in love with her, but she doesn't like him.
The characters: The rich jock(Jake), the hole school is in love with him.
The token black guy(Malik), he's always there but no one cares about him. The cruelest girl(Catherine) she just wants to have sex with his brother Jake. But she helps Janie to become a queen.
The ugly pretty girl(Janey), she's ugly at first, but pretty a the end. She's in love with Jake.
The cocky blonde guy, he's Jake's boy, a football player. The bitchie cheerleder(Priscilla)she broke up with Jake and is now dating a weirdo. The fat guy(The same from Varsity Blues, Billy Bob) he's fat and about to die.
The desperate virgins, they made a pact: Have sex before graduation. The best friend, he's in love with Janie. Obssesed.
This movie was very funny at the begining, but when the 60 minutes started to run, the movie was getting a little...NOT FUNNT.But then at the end was a little more...original.
The first 50 minutes are hilarious, the presentation of the character, I couldn't stop loughing.
The `Never been kissed' joke was one of the best, there was no cute Drew Barrymore, there was an old nasty lady.
10 things I love about Janie, and not 10 things I hat about you.
`She's all that' all over the movie, and chok laugh of `American Beauty' and `Bring it on'.
A good way to spend an hour and a half, teen version of`Scary Movie'.
The DVD was excellent. A lot of extras, documentaries, Marilyn Manson's Tainted Love makin' the video, an I.Q. test of teen movies, like 20 deleted scenes, and a lot more.
Like an hour of extra fun!!.
Worth renting and maybe buying!

1466923,5,B00005JKMW,I think this movie is so funny. I know a lot of people do not like it but I think it is great. The desperate virgins are the best. Oh you laugh the whole movie. If people get offended by it they just cant take a joke. It is all for fun. If people keep being offended easily at everything then this world is going straight to hell.,1029628800,,330,3.8676470588235294
1466924,2,B00005JKMW,"The promos for this movie looked pretty funny, but although some scenes will really crack you up, this movie is just a bit too bland for my taste.  This is just one more parody of those teen flicks out there.  I guess the makers of this movie thought that since Scary Movie did so well, how could this spoof go wrong.  I think we've all seen one to many movies like this one.
John Hughes High School is no different from any other high school:  There are clicks of jocks, nerds, cool girls, the haves and the have nots.  The least likely guys ant to get together with the best looking girls, and the nerdy girls dream of dating the great looking jocks.  Popular jock Jake bets that he can make any girl a prom queen (sound familiar?)  His friends pick unpopular Janey - the poor girl with the ponytail and glasses that likes to paint.  Her brother is after the hottest girl in school.  He plans to give her a letter designed to make her fall in love with him.  This movie contains spoofs of She's All That, Can't Hardly Wait, The Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink, Rudy, American Pie, 10 Things I Hate About You, and more.
There are some good points to this movie: 1. Lacey Chabert portrays the hottest girl in school, a role once played by her Party Of Five co-cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt in Can't Hardly Wait.  2. Several stars from the old teen movies make appearances in this movie.  Molly Ringwald is a teen romance bashing flight attendant.  Paul Gleason reprises his role as the principal in a parody of one of the most memorable scenes from The Breakfast Club.  Sean Patrick Thomas makes an appearance as well.  3. The subtle references to other teen movies.  The name of the school is John Hughes High School - John Hughes is famous for his teen angst movies.  Posters, writing on the walls, names of areas within the school - all refer to scenes or characters from other teen movies.  4. The parody of the overly hyped American Pie scene with Jason Biggs and a freshly baked pie.
And yet, I feel this falls short of its intended goal - hysterical laughter.  The film could have been done better and in much better taste.  There is no need to see naked women in every other scene - it doesn't make the movie any funnier.
In other words - rent this movie, don't buy it.  You'll save money and get a chuckle or two.",1029628800,,2324,4.370629370629371
1466925,4,B00005JKMW,"Yes, the movie is on the dumber side, but its dumb in the good way that doesnt insult your intelligence (for the most part anyway...)....
THE STORY:
This movies plot, at its most basic, is a retelling of the Shes All That story where the popular guy tries to make the ugly-duckling chick into the popular prom queen.  The students and campus of John Hughes (yuck yuck) High School provide the background.
THE COOL THINGS:
The movie, as its heart, is a spoof of most of the late 90s teen movies and an homage to the teen movies of the 1980s.  Among the movies saluted here include:  Shes All That,  10 Things I Hate About You, Never Been Kissed,  Varsity Blues, Cant Hardly Wait, Bring It On, Cruel Intentions, American Beauty, The American Pie, movies, Grease, The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Almost Famous, and Ferris Buellers Day Off.
On a whole, the movie is great for what it is, a rip on everyones favorite movie genre.  If you are a fan of spoofs and teen movies, this is definitely a great movie to see for a good laugh.  Most of the jokes are dead on.  Yes, a few of them bomb totally (ie  the bathroom scene, and the football scene) as just stupid, but on a whole, youll be laughing your socks off most of the time.
BEST SCENES:
1. The Grease Tribute Scene
WORST SCENE(S):
1. The toilet scene
2. Football flashback
3. Brother-sister lovin
4. Girl-girl lovin
THE DVD FEATURES:
If you love stacked DVDs, this DVD should be no exception.  Heres what you got in this one:
1. Commentary Tracks:  There are 3 commentary tracks to choose from  1) Filmmakers commentary, 2) Cast commentary and 3) Teen Movie factoids commentary.
2. Schools In Session:  3 separate featurettes.  1)  Best Dressed  9 minute wardrobe featurette, 2) Class Clown  9 minute featurette where the Director discusses the filming of the gag scenes, 3) Freshman Year  The director and cast discusses the movie and some of the more controversial scenes.
3. Deleted Scenes:  THE BEST PART ABOUT THE DVD.  19 deleted scenes, most totally hilarious!!!  Too bad these didn't make it into the movie as they (unlike most deleted scenes) would have added to the movie.
4. Marilyn Mansoons Tainted Love music video.
5. Yearbook  cast photo gallery.
THE VERDICT:
In all, the movie is great for what it is  a hilarious comedy.  Sure a few of the scenes are really dumb, but on a whole the comedy is fairly intelligent and hilarious.  Again, if you are into spoofs and teen movies, this movie is definitely worth seeing.  If you need to unwind and get a good laugh, watch this.  The DVD, if you are so inclined, will make a perfect addition to your collection as the extras are definitely worth your time and purchase.

1466926,1,B00005JKMW,"I'm only writing this review because Amazon ""recommended"" this flick for me. There's really not much to say about this movie except that if you've seen the commercial you've enjoyed yourself a lot more than if you've had to sit through the full length feature.
The gags are funny - in theory. In practice, the director, uhm, how should I say this...is [poor]. He has absolutely no sense of COMIC TIMING, which is essential in a comedy. Hence, you're left watching a joke, thinking this should be funny, but yet you're not laughing. Go with something like Screwballs, 100 Girls, American Pie, Porky's, or Scary Movie instead.",1028678400,,624,4.841121495327103

1466986,4,B00005JKMW,"When I saw this flick, I didn't it was too bad. There is a 50-50 opinion about this movie, but I stand with those who think it's a good movie. Not Another Teen Movie is as we may all know, a paraody of most of the ""teen"" movies made like She's All That (it was actually shot at the school were She's All That was shot as well), American Pie, and most of John Hughes films, etc. The main plot (which is pretty much plotless) is mostly based on She's All That, when Jake the main chracter bets that he could turn Janey (a good looking chick wearing glasses and a pony tail) into a prom queen. But, that doesn't really hang for long, for we are also pulled into other stuff rather than seeing Janey become a prom queen.
There are some hilarous scenes and it has the typical parody lines in this flick. Could be considered boring for those who like more of tasteful movies (because let's face it, this movie is tasteless), while this movie is just for laughs and a way to see those stuff seen in those teen movies we like, again. I recommend it to all those who like ""Scary Movie"", for this does indeed live up to it.
But however, I do recommend that you rent it first, because Not Another Teen Movie is one flick that can vary people's opinion very fast and heavily.",1027987200,,1263,4.223140495867769
1466987,4,B00005JKMW,"I've read horrible reviews about NATM, both here on Amazon.com and in the critical press and have avoided renting it on my biweekly trip to the video store.  But one week left a slim collection of choices so I decided to finally take the plunge and rent it.
I'm glad I did, actually.  The movie itself is typical sophomoric humor, but the spoofs of so many movies that I have watched over the years made it a lot of fun in viewing.  References were made to two of my favorite 1980's movies that I thought were almost lost in obscurity: ""Lucas"" and ""Better Off Dead"".  Some of my favorites of the recent genre are also covered including ""American Pie"" and ""Cruel Intentions"".  I haven't seen all of the movies that NATM spoofs, but I bet the movie goes from one spoof scene to another throughout.
It was great to see the ""Breakfast Club"" detention spoof with Paul Gleason, the principal in the original movie.  The kid who recreated the Judd Nelson role was dead-on.  Also dead on was the ""Sensitive Guy"" who nailed Chris Klein's ""Oz"" character from ""American Pie"".  I also got a kick out of the foreign exchange student.  You know the foreign exchange student is going to get naked in the picture and the director found an interesting way to show that (by the way, whoever she is, she is absolutely gorgeous and almost puts Shannon Elizabeth to shame).
I am actually considering buying this on DVD.  The extras that I viewed were fun and I bet the commentary tracks are fun and informative as well (might even allow me to pick up a couple of references I missed in the first couple of viewings).
All in all, a good and mindless 90 minute diversion.",1027641600,,1648,4.5

This would include, Pretty in Pink(major one!!) She's all that(also very major)  The Breakfast Club(has at least one whole scene devoted  to it)  Can't Hardly Wait, Bring it On, Cruel Intentions, etc, etc.  Overall, it's a movie that you'll probably only watch once, so it's probably best to just rent it.

There is always the ugly girl that gets the makeover to end up better-looking and stuff like that.

1466992,3,B00005JKMW,"""Not Another Teen Movie"" is a spoof comedy that jabs fun at every teen-themed movie made in the last 15 years, from ""The Breakfast Club"" to ""American Pie"". At times, the movie is very funny, at other times, it's own stupidity is cause for laughter.
The most prevelant spoofs are of ""She's All That"" (Jock turns nerdy girl into prom queen), ""Bring It On"" (cheerleaders stealing other squad's cheers), and ""Cruel Intentions"" (Sister wants to go to bed with her brother). These are the funny moments, with some snappy, often vulgar dialogue. What I loved was how it pokes fun at the character cliches, introducing the ""Token Black Guy"", ""The  Obsessed Best Friend"", ""The Popular Jock"", and ""The Nasty Cheerleader"". As spoofs go, this one is well timed. Teen movies are the trend, so movies like this are inevitable. To it's credit, ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is much better than ""Scary Movie"".
The low points of this movie are what keep it from being a great movie. Subtle humor is often more effective than in-your-face gross out humor. I didn't find the toilet scene (you can't miss it) to be amusing, just revolting. As well, the tastless ""American Pie"" jabs, with Randy Quaid having ""Three Way"" with two pies, is just stupid. Sometimes, a comedy should know when to quit.
The DVD package is full of goodies, from a cache of deleted scenes (18 in all), too a quiz to test your teen movie knowledge, to the audition outtakes. For a fan of the movie, you couldn't ask for anything more. For the casual viewer, the extras add to the juvenile fun of the movie.
Overall, this is not a great movie. Not that I was expecting one, so no harm done. In truth, ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is a mixed bag: smart at times, stupid at others. I recommend viewing it with a group of friends, so you can all laugh out loud. Other than that, it is not a movie that warrants repeated viewings.",1026345600,6,1869,4.5625

Movie itself Was not that great, Not that bad either. It had what you would expect from an R rated movie, Nudity,Language and Offensive jokes and Getting into Pointless situations. It did have some amusing qoutes and alot of good looking girls plus ""Mr T"" ((However he only had a 5 minute part, Bummer.)) I hope if they Decide to make a sequel ((Which i Wouldn't Doubt)) They could make more Intereactions in Funny Scenes and Jokes. If your looking to see another Teen comedy then give this a try.

This movie spoofs teen flicks from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" to the newest stuff being churned out by Hollywood, broadening its appeal beyond high school students into people who lived the Big 80s in high school.
It's not as mean-spirited or vulgar as the ""Scary Movie"" series, and in many ways, NATM reminds me more of the Zucker Bros. classic, ""Airplane"" for the various zingers and stereotypes thrown in. Lots of slapstick, sight gags and pop culture references will have you blurting out what teen film the last scene in NATM just spoofed.

Still, despite what I had heard about the movie, it wasn't so bad.
The humor is rather sickening at times, but I find that sort of thing hilarious so I enjoyed it.  The storylines and scenes are ripped almnost entirely from other movies with some shaving down of the bits we said we didn't like (like the heart warming stuff, et all) and the other funny bits they couldn't fit in.  It was nice to See Pretty In Pink and The Breakfast Club included in the movies that inspired this one, being two of the best ever.
The soundtrack is fantastic, one of the best I have ever heard, though the original recordings on quite a few were better.

They poke fun at a lot of teen movies, such as She's All That, Varsity Blues, The Breakfast Club, American Pie, Never Been Kissed, Can't Hardly Wait, Bring it on, 10 Things I Hate About You and every other thinkable teen movie. A lot of it funny, but not all of it works either. Besides overdoing it gross wise, it over does it with the vulgarity as well. I would give some exapmles but I probably shouldn't, lol. One thing I must say I found pretty funny though is the foreign exchange student that walks around nude, that is obviously suppose to be Shannan Elizibeth in American Pie. A lot of the She's All that stuff is pretty funny too. Chyler Leigh (That 80s Show) wants to go to Art School, yet all she draws is smiley faces. Also like the part where the Freddie Prinze Jr. kid goes to help her younger brother when he's getting picked on by bullies and winds up beating him up too.

It might have been a clever flick, but instead, the makers insisted knocking off a scene or two from about every ""teen"" movie in the last 20 years. Therefore, it looks like a mass fingerpainting of a movie, tied together with a few gags.
Unfortunately, all the jokes are just plain uncreative and offensive, either disgusting, perverse, or racist.

1467122,2,B00005JKMW,"Spoof of the teen genre is mostly middling, but does strike inspiration with its take on stereotypes (The Token Black Guy,The Cocky Blonde Guy, The Pretty Ugly Girl) and their behavior.  The first half-hour is pretty damn funny, but the movie starts to lose momentum as it runs along, until it runs out of steam entirely by the end.  Gotta love that naked foreign exchange chick (played by a sexy Cerina Vincent, who has a body to die for), though.  The DVD features 18 deleted scenes, a lot of which are actually pretty funny, moreso than many of the scenes that were in the actual film itself.

The overall plot line is from Pretty in Pink but that is the best we get.  There are all sorts of opportunities through out the film for funny side gags and other stories but the director and screen writers seemed to want to bludgeon the viewers into submission with too many potty gags.

1467124,5,B00005JKMW,"""Not Another Teen Movie"" is my favorite spoof to date. This teen comedy makes fun of many of the teen movies that have been produced, such as ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" ""Never Been Kissed,"" ""American Pie,"" and many, many more. The movie starts off with a hysterical scene that is very sexual and should not be described here; just buy the movie and you can see it for yourself! The general plot of this fantastic comedy is basically based on ""Never Been Kissed"" and this film incorporates many other teen comedies to make one of the best films to date.
 What makes this film so funny is based on a variety of factors. The movie is a spoof and for viewers that have seen a good majority of the movies that are being made fun of will understand this movie a bit more than a viewer that hasn't seen the movies that are spoofed upon. This doesn't mean, however, that viewers that haven't seen the movies that are being made fun of will not enjoy this.
 This movie is also one of the most hysterical comedies ever made because of the sexual content. This movie is NOT for somebody that gets upset from dirty images and sexual references. This film is great for somebody that would enjoy a comedy that can handle the crude language and images. The sex jokes make this film very fun. In fact, I'd say that this movie is way better than American Pie in this sense.
 The DVD in general is one of the better DVD's that I have viewed. The menu is very easy to function and works from bottom to top, so don't get confused while making the choice of what you want to watch. Most of the scenes that were deleted in the theater and that are on the DVD are wonderful and add for extra viewing pleasure. In additon to the deleted scenes you will get a chance to view commentaries by the production crew and by the cast. This is one DVD that is not only worth buying because of the film; the content on this DVD is superlative.
 ""Not Another Teen Movie"" easily ranks as one of my all time favorite movies and I doubt that my opinion of this film will ever change. The DVD is wonderful too as it is easy to move around on and the extra bonuses are wonderful. This film is not to be missed by a comedy fan or somebody that wants to see some of the popular teenage movies being made fun of. This is a great movie and DVD that is defintely worth adding to your collection.

The opening few minutes sets the tone for the whole movie and it really is a good time. It basically pokes fun of all the teen movies made in the past 10 years. This version also includes cast interviews and the making of Marilyn Manson's video ""Tainted Love"" which alone makes this movie worth seeing.",1023321600,,498,4.606741573033708
1467127,4,B00005JKMW,"Not exactly what you'd pay to see unless you're into movies like American Pie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, or Scary Movie. I decided to rent it instead, because after a long stretch of entertaining but sometimes repetitive 'teen' movies, I was interested in what Not Another Teen Movie would be like. While watching, I was not only squeaming by the pretty gross things that happened, but I also found myself laughing at some point. It starts off with Janey pleasuring herself while watching She's All That (kind of like how American Pie starts off with Jason Biggs in his room). Kind of gross already.
 Pretty much, this movie rips off the likes off She's All That. Janey Briggs is like Laney Boggs. She's beautiful, but because she wears glasses and a ponytail she instantly becomes a dork. Jake Wyler, the popular jock (who is also pretty easy on the eyes) is incidentally dumped by his girlfriend, the popular and pretty Priscilla. Jake's little guy clique (including the funny but witty black guy who's only in this film for his remarks, mocking an often seen cliche) decides to make a bet that he can't turn just any girl into a prom queen. After choosing from several hideous girls-from a hunchback, to an extremely pale girl with bloodshot eyes, to twins attatched at the forehead-they decide to choose Janey. Jake quotes: ""Not the glasses! And the ponytail!""
 Soon the film follows into the same plot as She's All That but begins to intertwine with many teen movies including: American Pie, 10 Things I Hate About You, Can't Hardly Wait, Bring It On, Cruel Intentions, Varsity Blues, The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and much more (even a little bit of Pleasantville and Almost Famous I believe). The movie seems like a big viewing of plain stupidity along with lots of crude, sex-related humor but some decent scenes were pretty funny the first time. Like I said, if you're into stuff like Road Trip (also in this movie), you'll see yourself laughing. With cameo appearances by Molly Ringwald, Mr. T, Melissa Joan Hart, Paul Gleason (returning as a previous role...my favorite scene actually) and a surprising performance from Good Charlotte (singing likable covers) this movie definitely isn't a winner, but it sure entertains.",1022803200,,2271,4.896103896103896

It's title and previews suggest that it is a funny teen movie however this movie is definately not for teen's at all, aside from the enormous amount of bad language, the sexual content alone makes this film closer to an X rating then it's soft rating of R. To be blunt, to rent or buy this movie you have to be eighteen, and I wouldn't even get this for my seventeen year old sister because it is so appauling!
Parent's beware, your kids might want to see it because of the misdirrecting previews but believe me, unless you want the facts of life poorly explained to them through a movie that most parents have discribed to me as soft porn you definately do not want to get this for your kids.

Most of the scenes that have been taken from other movies - like the promise to loose thier virginity in American Pie - have just been packed into random places to try and fit in as many as possible, without really contributing to the overall storyline.

1467183,3,B00005JKMW,"Despite the disgusting and unnecessary scenes in this movie regarding toilets and self-gratifying machinery, this is a pretty funny movie.  I just left my brain at the door, and took this movie for what it was..a spoof comedy that shouldn't be taken too seriously.
Chyler Leigh, that spikey Punker poser chick on ""That 80's Show""(I can't believe this is the same actress!), plays the geeky four-eyed artist type, Janey, who is the victim of the ""She's all that"" spoof.  This is basically the plot of the film, the rest of the spoofs all sideline this.  Think of all the teen movies in recent years and go back to the movies from the 80's of the John Hughes set, ""Sixteen Candles"", ""Ferris Bueller"", ""Some kind of Wonderful"", ""Pretty in Pink"", and ""Breakfast Club"" are all in here.  I think unless you saw all of these that you won't get some of the spoofing.
""The Breakfast Club"" spoof was my personal fave.  It was great that they brought back ""Mr. Vernon"", actor Paul Vernon, and his toilet seat cover, to help the spoof seem that much more believable and just downright hilarious.  It was hysterically funny.
The theme of teen movies being spoofed was a great idea, and it went over well.  My big problem, of course, was the intention of a ""Porky's"" spoof turning into toilet city.  I don't know about anyone else, but this didn't make me laugh. I just sat there in disgust.  This has just got to stop.  How many times now have we seen the attempt at humor in the bathroom? It's been used far too much, and while it never had my appeal, I think it's lost any appeal at all now just from it's overuse.  Let's think of something original now!
The opening scene is also pretty disgusting, be forewarned.  I will never look at Chyler's character in ""That 80's show"" the same ever again if that show comes back.  It was a spoof of ""American Pie"".
I think one should definitely keep an open mind, and just try and have fun watching this despite the two scenes I mentioned.
I had a good time watching most of it.
They even spoof the movie musical, and the cast was crooning.  They actually sounded pretty good.
There were some cameos, and Randy Quaid, who played Cousin Eddie in the Vacation Movies, plays Janey's vietnam vet dad.  He was pretty funny.
If you are up for an amusing but sometimes disgusting spoof of teen comedies of the past 20 years, this is a good take.  Just be prepared for anything...",1020816000,,2402,4.51270207852194

1467259,5,B00005JKMW,"My rating of this movie is based on both the DVD & the movie itself.  If you're expecting a sit-through cohesive story, you're not going to get it here.  It is non-stop spoof, and it accomplishes this very well.
The plot is simple enough: twist dozens of teen-movies of past's plots and collage them together.  The movie has its ups and downs.  Some of the spoofs are just OK while others are uproarious.  The opening scene and Chapter 18's ""Bring It On"" sequence have to be the highlights of the actual movie.  It was nice to see some surprise cameos as well as spoofs of some of the teen movies from the 1980's.  I still remember being in the theater smiling as I heard some of the underage viewers' reactions to the more controversial scenes.  That's why it is rated R!
The real highlight here is the DVD itself.  It is very rich in features that many new DVDs are lacking.  There are a whopping 18 deleted/shortened scenes that make this 90-minute feature turn into an all-night riot.  Some of the deleted scenes are the cream of the crop clips.  Add the 3 special featuerettes of ""the making of,"" and you have a complete DVD.  The Marilyn Manson video, while I like the song, seemed more like an MTV promo than anything.  It included the ""making of"" the video that MTV had created.  It was still a nice addition.
Again, this is a 'movie' that is a collection of spoofs.  If you're expecting a deep plot, search elsewhere.  However, if you're looking fall out of you chair laughing, this is your ticket.

1467260,1,B00005JKMW,"""Not Another Teen Movie"" parodies of two decades worth of romantic movies made for teens. This genre reached its zenith in the 1980s with John Hughes films like ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink"". By the 1990s, this kind of movie, overall, had become banal and predictable. A couple of years ago, ""Scary Movie"" took a sharp and hysterically funny look at the cliches and formulas used in contemporary horror movies. The teen romance movie is an equally deserving target, but this movie doesn't know where to aim its arrows. It's no better than the movies it parodies; in fact, it's worse than many of them.
There are scenes that work, but they are few and far between. When they show up, though, you tend to disregard them because you've been numbed by lots of dumb ideas and bad dialog.
Characters say and do the grossest, most appalling things throughout the movie. I've always felt that it takes a supremely talented comedic actor to get away with such behavior. The idea is to make people laugh in spite of themselves, and that takes perfect timing and delivery plus exceptional body language. The cast of ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is a mediocre one. What I felt for every actor was embarrassment.
I have rarely seen a mainstream film with so much scatological humor in it. In almost every instance, the writers fail to provide the setups necessary to make the raunchy scenes funny. Many of the jokes are so old that you can predict the payoffs long before they appear.
To succeed as a parody, a movie usually has to work as satire too, and here is where this picture totally falls apart. Satire comes from using witty language to convey insults or scorn. The dialog here is devoid of wit. A group of average teens could have written it better themselves, and the movie probably failed at the boxoffice because bright teens realized this. Not so bright teens don't get parody or satire to begin with. They must have thought that this was just another teen movie.",1020470400,3,1968,4.674351585014409

 Lastly,if the writers didn't skewer a movie directly-read the background signs-it takes repeated viewings to catch half of what they were doing.
 My last comparison to show this should be classic SOON is in the '70's people were shocked seeing Julie Haggerty inflate the auto-pilot...this has a contemporary comedy sensibilities-so if easily offended-you didn't see the movies they were satirizing anyway.

But mostly, this film is about a handsome guy who places a bet with his friends that he can change the class geek (Chyler Leigh) into a ... sorority girl.

1467326,1,B00005JKMW,"From the previews, this looked like it would be a hysterical movie. It was a good concept but unfortunately like most concepts, it never came to fruition. I usually enjoy this genre of movie spoofs (Scary Movie) but this one was just too contrived and poorly executed. The biggest flaw in this movie was it was very disjointed and the plot didn't flow smoothly. It was kind of like watching Saturday Night Live without any commercial breaks. Skit after skit of parodies from cult classics (you name it, they did it) but put together like a patchwork quilt. The other big flaw was that a lot of the scenes were just not funny. I've got a healthy sense of humor but this movie tested it. After a while, I was trying to find stuff to laugh at. It was agonizing to watch them act through a well-known scene and not bring anything new to the table, and worse, have their reenactment turn out to be unfunny. The majority of the funny scenes turned up in the preview and it left you wanting for more.
The whole cheerleader skit got lame quick, (crippled from jump), especially when they reenacted a scene from ""Bring It On"". The virgins trying to be deflowered also got weak, quick fast and in a hurry. A lot of the scenes would have been funny if they had not dragged them out and ended them quick, but they took somewhat funny scenes and dragged them to death. I rolled my eyes at so many scenes that I had a headache. It's as if they didn't know when to quit. I enjoyed a few scenes but the movie was very forgettable, I only remember one or two scenes that were worth laughing at.
Maybe my expectations were too high, although I didn't expect much and I got even less. Just one scene after another of borrowed material. I don't recall there being very much original stuff. It probably would have been better if they had come up with a movie and then added in spoofs, as opposed to trying to build a whole movie around nothing but spoofs.
In short, it really could have been something funny but they ruined it by being completely unoriginal. If you feel the need to waste money, go ahead and buy it, otherwise, rent it and make up your own mind. Again, I strongly advise against purchasing this movie.",1015200000,2,2197,4.400491400491401

1467328,4,B00005JKMW,"Well, so far I've seen this twice, and it may grow on me some more. You gotta be a real teen movie buff to have ""done your homework"" enough to catch all the references. I guess the makers of this have seen all the movies it takes aim at. But I wonder if anyone else has. But the one movie it seems to zero in on most of all is SHE'S ALL THAT, which I'd have to see again to fully appreciate this. Too bad that's the only reason I've ever found to see SHE'S ALL THAT again. In fact, I'm wondering -- SHE'S ALL THAT was so silly, what if someone saw it AFTER seeing this? Could SHE'S ALL THAT look like a spoof of this instead? Other movies spoofed are with mixed results. The spoof of NEVER BEEN KISSED did nothing for me. I liked that movie but could still imagine an effective spoof of it, but this ain't it. On the other hand, they could have done more with BRING IT ON and I wish they had. A better cheerleader travesty is SUGAR AND SPICE. AMERICAN PIE is also spoofed ineffectively with an intended send-up of Nadia, that left me only missing the real Nadia. Some reviews are saying this spoofed also CAN'T HARDLY WAIT. But all I can remember of that uneven movie is Lauren Ambrose's surprise shining performance and I didn't catch anything in this to spoof that. For those totally uninhibited in their sense of humor, NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE spoofs a short scene from DETROIT ROCK CITY. If they were going to take on that movie at all, I'm surprised they passed up the most hilarious part - the priest under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms. But on second thought, a scene so hilarious would be hard to contribute more humor to through a spoof, so maybe that explains it. Well there's a lot more that could be said, but as for me I'm ready to rush out to my video store to catch up on some of this movie's targets that I missed!",1014249600,28,1841,4.247863247863248
1467329,2,B00005JKMW,"This seems to go by a rule that the better the movie being parodied, the less effectively it parodies it. The already lame SHE'S ALL THAT must be the most heavily drawn upon by this parody, and the most memorably and coherently parodied. But a movie as silly as SHE'S ALL THAT is prone to be more emulated than parodied by any parodic attempt, and that happens to a considerable extent. On the other hand, the few stabs taken at NEVER BEEN KISSED fall utterly flat. NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE is indiscriminate in what it parodies, taking on even movies that are already parodies, like SCARY MOVIE. It's hard to parody a parody, but no one seemed to have thought of that. It's furthermore hard to imagine any movie having time to effectively parody all the many target movies that this one tries to take on. The bit of attempts aimed at AMERICAN PIE include a foreign exchange student to parody that film's Nadia. But Nadia had many funny and even likeable moments; her spoof herein seems to be in the movie only to first sarcastically and unfunnily insult the type of students... I hoped for (and guess I expected) more from this movie. The ultimate send-up of teen movies seemed a most intriguing idea.

movies. It takes clever new jabs on some older teen movies, while keeping the audience wrapped up in the story.

Leigh proves herself as a very versatile actress as she falls through a stairwell, cracks jokes and gets tagged in the head with a football.  Chris Evans, as Jake Wyler, the popular jock is clearly perfect for the role. Other cast members are Eric Christian Olsen, Mia Kirshner, Jaime Pressly and there are a ton more. The movie also features a handful of cameos of other teen movie stars. Overall this movie may very well be the funniest movie of 2001.",1011052800,3,726,4.541984732824427

1467405,2,B00005JKMW,"The typical teen movie has a lot of gross jokes and an air of comedy in it. So does a mickeytake movie like Scary Movie.
Scary Movie worked cause the films it parodies are serious, and so you can make a funny version and it's cool.
With the teen comedies parodied in this movie there was already humour and gross jokes, so the crew made the mistake of having more extreme jokes than the films they parody, which ends up rather OTT and too forced to be funny.
Take the scene where the horny school guys are in a ventilation pipe above the girls' toilet watching a student take a dump. This could have been funny handled well, but the pipe collapses and so does the floor of the toilet when the guys land in it, resulting in the toilet and the students crashing into the classroom below, and tons of fake turd going everywhere and covering everyone. Little kids might laugh at the presence of fake turd, but most people who watch this genre of movie (mid to late teens) will think this is really lame. Sadly a lot of the jokes in the movie are the same.
There are some good parts to this movie, but they are generally short, spread out and they don't do enough to make the movie good. See this at the cinema if nothing else is on, and don't buy it.",1010707200,,1246,4.239495798319328

Aside from a few scenes, none of this was even remotley funny. It was mainly very crude and offensive, and I am sorry to say that I wasted my time watching it. The film borrows it's plot from ""She's All That"", in which the popular jock makes a bet to turn the school nerd into the prom queen. From there on, theres nothing but filth. There were two scenes that I laughed at: a spoof of a musical number from ""Grease"", and the spoof of the Ricky Fitts character from ""American Beauty"". I gave this film two stars basically because the spoof of Ricky was just totally hilarious.

1467409,3,B00005JKMW,"""Scary Movie"" was a surprise hit when released in 2000, using spectacular gross-outs and in-jokes in an all-stops out parody of teenage horror films of the 90's. Of course, that success led to a sequel, as well as the notion that another genre of movies was ripe for a fresh beating: the teenage comedy genre. That's where ""Not Another Teen Movie"" comes in, doing ""Scary Movie"" one better with a parade of extreme gross-outs and satirical looks at the teen movies of the previous decade.
Of course, there's no new ground covered in this territory, which lapses from chuckler to full-out gutbuster at various points in its running time. Like ""Scary Movie,"" there are main characters who each represent those from different teen-oriented movies, thrown together into a storyline that combines the most salacious and memorable scenes from each film and casts them into a comedic light. Those with a weak stomach should definitely look elsewhere, and cynics will undoubtedly despise the movie for its willingness to become what it spoofs; however, the film is serviceable entertainment that delivers what it promises.
The plot is pretty basic: high school teenager Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh), who spends her time reading self-help books on teen rebellion and indulging herself perhaps a bit too much while watching ""She's All That,"" is the odd duck of the group of teenagers attending John Hughes High School. When she's asked out by popular football jock Jake Wyler (Chris Evans), she finds herself at the center of a bet between Jake and his fellow teammates as to whether or not he can turn her appearance around before senior prom.
Attached to the cookie-cutter plot are various subplots derived from such movies as ""Cruel Intentions,"" as Jake's sister Catherine puts some not-so-subtle moves on him, and ""Never Been Kissed,"" as actress Beverly Poclyn prances around the school, wrinkles and all, pretending to be a student. Such stints provide some extremely crude humor, most notably the girl-on-girl kiss scene, which may send some reeling for the bathroom (for anyone who has seen the previews, don't say you weren't warned).
Yet, in spite of its outright embracement of voracious crudeness, I found myself enjoying the movie for the most part. The comical look at the cheerleader comedy ""Bring It On"" is absolutely riotous, as is cheerleader Sandy Sue, who lapses into vicious fits of profanity in the blink of an eye. Janey Briggs is modeled after Jason Biggs's character in ""American Pie,"" from which the movie gathers much of its comedy, including an all-stops-out version of the toilet scene, and its very own foreign exchange student who spends the movie parading around in her birthday suit; even the subtitles for her dialogue are spaced out so nothing is hidden from view.
Some modern audiences may not understand some of the film's references to such movies as ""The Breakfast Club,"" or why such stars as Randy Quaid, who appears as Janey's drunken, pie-plunging father, are present in such a film. This is low-brow comedy at its most hardcore, surpassing previous films in its extreme nature, but not quite in its humor. I expected a little more from ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" but enjoyed its pleasantries in spite of its shortcomings.",1010102400,4,3250,5.031539888682746
1467410,4,B00005JKMW,"I am not saying that the movie is realistic, because it is completely opposite.  I am just relating this movie to our lives, and how screwed up they can be.  Life is funny, we all have our ups and downs.....and even if we get what we want, we will still whine and complain, because it is not enough.  Stangly enough....that is what this movie was trying to portray...in a very sick, sedistic kinda way.
Now, here is the problem.  If you have seen movies like, The Animal, Ace Ventura..1&2, The Naked Gun Series, Scary Movie..1&2, and all of those type of movies...expect much of the same......but more modern.  It takes captions of 10 things I hate about you, Cruel Intentions, and about five other movies that have came out in the past year or so.  This movie is hillarious, but I think that they go overboard too much.  I enjoy humor alot, but I think they could have done without some of the extreme nasty crud, because it can make you uncomforable to sit through it and watch.  But that didn't happen too often.  I went to watch Not Another Teen Movie the week after it came out, and there still was a large crowd.  I saw it with my best friend, and we couldn't stop laughing.  We are both 19, and in college......but don't let that make you discouraged.  My mother and father went to watch this movie also.......they said it was somewhat disgusting, but hillarious. Not Bad considering that my dad is 48 and my mom is 46.  I wouldn't take my little brother or sister to see it though.  It would be too much for little children to watch.
Overall, I would have given it a 5 star rating, but I felt it was a little too much.  I like funny, but not ridiculous.  Well, go and watch it with a crowd, and have fun.",1009584000,,1712,4.336477987421383
1467411,3,B00005JKMW,"""Not Another Teen Movie,"" directed by Joel Gallen, is a silly, entertaining spoof of the whole teen movie genre. Films from the 1980s John Hughes heyday onward are satirized: ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""American Pie,"" etc. Although not all of the jokes work, the movie as a whole is pretty funny.
The story follows a group of students at John Hughes High School (wink, wink). Each character is a recognizable genre stereotype: the cocky blond guy, the desparate virgin, the sexy foreign exchange student, etc. One of the film's best assets is its likable young cast. The actors tear into the silly material with enthusiasm. Chris Evans is solid as ""popular jock"" Jake Wyler, as is Chyler Leigh as Janey Briggs, the ""ugly"" girl who just needs to lose her ponytail and glasses. But the most hilarious performance is probably turned in by Jaime Pressly, who is deliciously over-the-top as ""nasty cheerleader"" Priscilla. The main cast is nicely complemented by some clever cameos; I won't ruin the fun surprises by revealing those cameos here.
There is a lot of gross-out humor involving incest, masturbation, and various bodily secretions. The film actually starts off strong with a spectacularly funny sequence involving an adult ""toy."" Yes, some of the dialogue and abundant sight gags are crude, cruel, violent, and even exploitative, so avoid the film if you're sensitive to such stuff.
The cast performs a big musical number, and the film also makes clever use of recognizable songs. NATM isn't exactly Oscar Wilde, but for what it is, it's fun.",1009238400,17,1560,5.003846153846154
1467412,2,B00005JKMW,"I tried to keep an open mind going into ""Not Another Teen Movie"". The teen film is ripe for parody and maybe someday we'll get a good, funny film that skewers the genre. This one certainly isn't it. Sure, it had some funny moments (Jaime Pressly is especially good as the head cheerleader), but most of the jokes fall flat and the film just becomes another lame teen flick. Also, someone in the writing team is obsessed with scatological (and I mean that literally) humor. It's just disgusting and not funny at all. Finally, some of the films that are targeted will probably not be familiar to those THIS film is targeted toward, since most were released when today's teens were toddlers (""Pretty In Pink"" and ""Risky Business"", for example). It's fun to see actors from that era (Molly Ringwald, particularly), but their presence probably went over the heads of the kids in the audience. If you feel you must see this, rent it first.
