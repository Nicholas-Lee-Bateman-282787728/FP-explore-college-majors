8325370,1,B000KWZ2W4,"This video was outdated way before it was ever made. Fortunately for me I checked it out of the library and didn't waste my money. The productions values are awful, the intstructor is very monotone and some of the techniques he describes are antiquated baseball philosophy. In the demonstrations the players are CONSTANTLY getting on top or underneath the ball, it would have been nice to see a line drive hit every once in a while in a hitting mechanics video. I'm sure the presenter, Tony Dello, is a great guy and believes in what he is doing, but personally I think this video does more harm than good.",1358035200,,606,4.568807339449541
8325371,1,B000KWZ2W4,"the so called expert in this video talks about swinging down on the ball,if you watch the pro's you can see that they are clearly not swinging down and the presentation of the whole video is very poorly done,the drills he gives you are useful but his explaination to each of them is not given clearly...out of this video he gives one good tip which is stand back in the batters box if the pitcher is fast. Do yourself a favor and skip this video.",1249689600,,446,4.258823529411765
8325372,4,B000KWZ2W4,"I found it quite educational, although I was expecting something a bit more mathematically rigorous. Basic equations were presented, as well as all the orbital mechanical elements. A good number of concepts were explained, including why the lowest orbital inclination attainable by launches are the the same as the launch location's latitude. The video was fairly grainy, like low-quality VHS. While it's tolerable, a crisp DVD release would be nice. I recommend it without reservation for use in high school or undergraduate physics classrooms, beginning astronomy classes, or if you're just curious about space and orbital mechanics like me!",1123027200,,643,5.505050505050505
