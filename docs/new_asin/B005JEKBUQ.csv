4712596,5,B005JEKBUQ,"I was pleased to have the chance to add to my collection of this series.  I taped the entire series on the good old VHS and I was so disappointed to see it cancelled. Great to have this new additional and challenging material.  I have tried other yoga series, this is my favorite by far.  The scenery, music, instruction, pace and length of episodes work great for me.  I have been doing this faithfully about 6 days a week for a year.  I feel great. I hope they go back to the studio and produce another series for the faithful! I also like YOGAmazing podcasts with Chaz Rough. 25 minutes a day in your own home,with yoga.there are no excuses!",1335571200,13,644,4.333333333333333
4712597,3,B005JEKBUQ,I fell in LOVE with the Namaste Yoga series when it was on FIT TV! This video is different than the series - it's a bit longer and the exercises are a bit faster and more challenging. I will still use the video however it is not one of my favorites.,1334361600,18,249,3.9019607843137254
4712598,5,B005JEKBUQ,I am absolutly loving this DVD  The yoga breath is a amazing tool. This DVD is great for understanding the many aspects of yoga. As the asanas are only a small amount of yoga,1329004800,2,174,4.117647058823529

4712601,5,B005JEKBUQ,"This is an incredible DVD --- you must have Five Elements in your collection (along with her other DVDs  Kate Potter's easy-to-follow style makes yoga an experience.  This DVD compliments her other Namaste Yoga series.  It takes some practice to master all the poses...but I always want a challenge.

I've tried many ""Yoga"" DVDs -- but always go back to Kate Potter.

4712602,5,B005JEKBUQ,"The Five Elements continues Kate Potter's wonderful and unique vinyasa style yoga paired with fantastic cinematography and breathtakingly unique music;  with an added bonus: an entire section devoted entirely to information about Ayruveda, a sister science to yoga and ancient form of holistic healing in India. She gives brief descriptions of each dosha, what takes them out of balance, and what helps them stay in balance.

No matter how much time you have, there is a practice for you on this DVD. Five breath-body links, each about 1-2 minutes long; three sequences about 15-20 minutes long, each uniquely tailored to help balance the doshas. There is also an expanded, 40 minute sequence called Firefan, geared to heat the body - it will get you going!

I love this DVD! When I am really stressed, this is the one I turn to. I have all of the DVD's and highly recommend them all!",1318032000,48,884,4.802631578947368

4712607,3,B005JEKBUQ,"I bought this DVD after reading other reviews.  I really like the Namaste series very much.  I used to watch the show on fit tv during it's run, years ago.  But their DVD are just too over priced.  I bought this one hoping I would get more out of it.  The breathing section is well made but you can not do all of them in a row. Which is very disconnecting.  Also this DVD is not very old (copyrighted from 2010) But it does not play on the newer BluRay DVD machines.  Also it would have been nice to have an electronic version to use on my Tablet.  Only viewed once so far but not very impressed.  I might save up to buy one of the season DVDs.

Cheers,

4712608,2,B005JEKBUQ,"I received this as a gift from my best. the sequence that I practiced today was quite lovely, production value for the series never skimped and this practice was no exception.  However I was dumbfounded scrolling through the menu and coming across only one practice.  This DVD is entitled the 5 elements, therefore how can only one element be represented?  I think this is a grave misstep on marketing/editing department as if it was just listed with the addition of fire sequence the buyer would know what they are getting. Also the price is a bit steep for this rather short practice. I have a pretty extensive yoga collection and this  is by far the most expensive with the least amount of content.",1389312000,8,701,4.67479674796748

4712610,2,B005JEKBUQ,"Wow, a complete disappointment.  I bought this CD after buying seasons 1 and 2 of the TV series.  There was way too much Kate Potter!!  She is old enough to be the mother of the other performers and she is in almost every scene!  Plus, you have to hear her talk for a minute or two each time you load the DVD, just to get to the second-rate content.",1378857600,4,349,4.0144927536231885

4712616,3,B005JEKBUQ,"So I have to say that the Namaste series is what got me into yoga. I left yoga for four year almost, suffered some depression here and there, gained weight, etc and it is time for me to come back to yoga.  I did not not to pay the full $50 for one of the seasons of Namaster, so I decided to try this.  I guess I imagined it having five sequences for the five elements, but the only full practice of element it has is fire.  It also has three shorter sequences as well as five breathing techniques relating to the other five elements.  It is a nice way to get back into yoga for me, so I'm pretty excited to do them!  When I have a little bit more money (poor college student here) I plan on buying both of the Namaste seasons because I love them!  Fittv just doesn't have as many good work out programs anymore like this or like Shimmy.",1361232000,13,837,4.042424242424242
4712617,5,B005JEKBUQ,"The Namaste Yoga tapes are the only ones I seem to come back to over and over again as the years roll by.  Initially I lost 70 lbs just doing them (which resulted in my taking better care of other lifestyle changes along the way).  At first all I could do was kind of stretch in place standing for a minute.  My goal was to put the tape in every day, first thing in the morning before I had a chance to talk myself out of it...and do what I felt like doing.  After 3 months I got 15 minutes in and was surprised at myself.  I'm an older woman who'd pretty much lost hope .  With that, I eventually did an entire session daily and my spirit changed as my mind changed as my body changed.  This is a beautiful video and great way to explore Namaste in your home.  At least it's proven time and again to work well for me.",1361145600,45,818,3.9754601226993866

Kate Potter gives great information about Yoga and how she has interlaced the Ayurveda practice into the routines.  I love the 3 different shorter practices related to the Ayurveda concept.  The Kapha is very energetic, whereas the Pita and Vata are more relaxing, depending on what you need.  There is also a longer more challenging practice.

I've been doing Season 1 for years; I was delighted to add Season 2 and then the Five Elements to my collection.  This particular installment gives you some nice choices--a longer, more challenging session (Fire Fan), and some shorter sessions designed for each dosha.  I'm a Vata, and I LOVE the Vata program.  No matter how tired or unwell I feel, that session always soothes and restores me.  I now have it memorized, and I often use it when traveling.  I also appreciated Kate Potter's introduction to Ayurveda, and the various breathing practices.  Another great installment--I'm already looking forward to the next one!",1346025600,7,757,5.206611570247934
8475652,4,B005JEKBUQ,"4.5 stars.  Thats excellent on my scale.
I fell HARD for the Namaste Yoga series, designed and narrated by Kate Potter, when I found it back in 2005 on FitTV.  Of course my service provider dropped the channel, but I found it again on DVD.  Bliss!  But it disappeared again after two fantastic seasons.
Now Ive found Kate Potters THE FIVE ELEMENTS on DVD. Love! Its a bit different than the first two seasons of the TV series episodes. But it still has all of the things that I loved about the original TV series. Kate Potters voice is rich and vibrant. Her instructions are easy to grasp and follow.  The visual style is still gorgeous.
 The FIVE ELEMENTS DVD includes:
- Some basics of Yoga, and Ayurveda principles and the elements descriptions of personality types.
- Flow sequences (from 10 to 13 minutes in length) and breathing practices, specifically to bring balance to those personality types,
- An extended flow sequence called Fire Fan.
-  Tips on finding the poses in the extended Fire Fan sequence.
 I admit that I started more interested in yoga-lite; the physical practices and they have been of definite benefit in improving flexibility, balance, tone, and relaxation. And frankly, it's just darned fun and feels good! Its also an activity that Ill be able to continue, unlike some of the sports that Ive had to give up as Ive gotten older. I wasn't into what I saw as the chanty, painful contortionist aspects of yoga. But Ive learned better and am developing a growing interest in aspects beyond the poses and flow. It intrigued me to look at these sequences, breathing practices, different personality types, and how the choice of sequences could be tailored for specific effect.  Im definitely a Fire (Pitta) personality! LOL! Could probably use some balance. While the fire sequences appeal to me, just based on the beautiful movements, like the second helping at dinner, they may not be what I would benefit the most from  a concept I hadnt considered before.
Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD. I just wish there were extended sequences for the other elements. And perhaps, more of Tim McCauleys music. Perhaps there will be in the future. In the meantime, I will be enjoying these for a long time to come and watching for more.",1504483200,10,2253,4.753846153846154

This was my first exposure to Kate Potter's teaching and I must say I love it. You get a lot of content on this disk. I absolutely love this workout. Below is the list of specific videos that are on this disk.

Kate's Teaching Sequences - 14 min

I really appreciate the short meditation video's. The introduction video's into Ayurvedic teaching on Pitta, Kapha and Vata were very informative. And with each of the three there is a short flow specific to that type and they range from 9-14 minutes. These are great to do when pressed for time or alongside other practices. But the two flows that are amazing and I know I will come back to again and again are the Fire Fan Sequence and Kate's Teaching Sequence. These are both wonderful flows. Kate's style and voice truly do make this a moving meditation practice. Both of these are very physically demanding flows. They have a few poses I had yet to encounter and this flow really pushes my limits. Even though I teach a physically demanding style of Yoga I greatly appreciate these flows and practice. I really look forward to doing this and trying more of Kate's teaching.

I am always open to trying new styles of yoga, new teachers and new practices and have been very happy with everything I have tried from Namaste Yoga. This is an awesome collection to add to your practice. It will be some amazing mat time for you.",1449100800,,1937,4.247282608695652

If you want to learn some simple yoga, if you want to be inspired by great scenery and talented yoginis (SP?) going through yoga poses, do yourself a favor and get the first two seasons!  It's not quite perfect, but that is the fault of the editor.  It's helpful to see the transitions between positions.  All too often the editor transitions between shots as the youginis are changing poses.  While sometimes annoying, it is not a major problem (hence the three stars)... in these seasons.  But things are beginning to come unhinged in this addition, The Five Elements in Yoga: the transition issue intensifies and for some inexplicable reason the cameraman/editor combo seem to think that the scenery is more important than the Yoginis!?  A lot more time is spent on the scenery.  Still, this is a worthwhile DVD and I am glad I own it!",1424822400,3,901,4.658227848101266
