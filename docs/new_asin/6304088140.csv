7862623,5,6304088140,"This tape has my fave episode on it!! The first ep, titled ""Captain Crocodile"" is about a TV show for kids with a very uptight host is trys to eliminate The Monkees and keep them from appearing on his show. Songs on it are ""Valleri"", and a great one (cause Peter sings it), ""Your Auntie Grizelda"". Second ep is called ""Fairy Tale"", and its about when Peter (yay!) falls in love with the princess, and goes to great lenghts to save her from being killed. This is sooo funny because the princess is played by Monkee Mike Nesmith, who thinks of himself as a ""groovy looking chick""! Including is a very small interview about the ep, and the song ""Daily Nightly""..enjoy!!",987724800,2,666,4.512396694214876
7862624,3,6304088140,"One episode from each of the show's two seasons are featured on this tape.  The first is a parody of the long-running Captain Kangaroo series - here the Monkees get a gig on Captain Crocodile, but the reason for the invitation quickly becomes clear as the obnoxious titular host of the show uses the boys solely as targets of abusive gags.  Mike finally demands the boys be allowed to play - a cleverly subtle allegory on the boys' real life fight with Don Kirshner -  so the Captain relents - except no one sees the boys as they do the original version - far superior to the downbeat 1968 version - of ""Valleri.""
The epsiode features a terrific satirical montage of the boys in varied TV roles - newsmen, Mike as a weatherman, Micky starring in a Batman spoof, and the game show To Tell A Fib - but overall it isn't as satisfying as most of the other episodes because the boys are humiliated almost throughout the story and even in the epilogue, and the abuse wears out its welcome by the end of Act One.
Though ultimately lacking in complete satisfaction as well, the second-season episode Fairy Tale is nonetheless a clever attempt at something different - The Monkees starring in a cheesy fairy tale with Mike as the ""beautiful"" (?) princess.  A big part of the reason for the episode's weakness is the mailed-in quality of the boys' performances - a sign of their dissatisfaction and exhaustion with the show.  The best moment comes when a dragon gives the boys a riddle they figure out to his surprise.
The episode's music video is the interesting B&W rendition of Mike's rambling LA-street-scene poem ""Daily Nightly,"" featuring Micky on Moog synthesizer.",979084800,3,1661,4.674657534246576
7862625,5,6304088140,"This video contains two episodes of the Monkees television series.
The first, ""Captain Crocodile"", is my favorite episode.  In it the  Monkees are hired to play on a children's television show, only to be the  victims of a paranoid host who is afraid that the Monkees want to replace  him.  The episode includes a great romp set to the novelty tune ""Your  Auntie Grizelda"" and a funny scene in which the Monkees tell the kids  a story...from the dictionary.
The second, ""Fairy Tale"", is  another favorite of many fans.  The Monkees tell the story of a poor  peasant in love with a princess.  The episode spoofs fairy tales while  providing the Monkees a chance to wear ridiculous costumes, most notably  Michael Nesmith, who plays the object of Peter's affections, the lovely (?)  Princess Gwen.
These are both great episodes.  If you want to buy one  of the volumes and are unsure of which to get, I would heartily recommend  volume 8.  Both episodes are strong, memorable, and funny.  Whether you are  a new fan or looking to revisit old memories, this tape is a great place to  start.",967334400,4,1087,4.675531914893617
7862626,3,6304088140,This tape has my favorite Monkees episode of all time: the fairy tale.  Whenever I want to laugh I always think of Mike's magic locket and his princess costume.  Most enjoyable for 60's television.,961372800,2,197,4.764705882352941
7862627,5,6304088140,"In this episode, the Monkees are supposed to play on the Captain Crocodile Show; but, the host of the show has other plans.  This was one of their best videos.  In it they play the song ""Auntie Grizelda.""  I  recommend this video to everyone.",961113600,2,242,4.431818181818182
