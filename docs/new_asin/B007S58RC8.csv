8521606,3,B007S58RC8,"Well, the recording quality was TERRIBLE.  I realize this must have been made from very old master tapes, but I don't understand charging so much money for such an inferior product!  I spent a year in Brazil many years ago, and was looking for a good novela to refresh my conversational skills,and some parts were very difficult to understand because of the heavy hiss and background noise.  There was one character, Januaria, whose name I honestly NEVER understood until the last quarter hour of the entire series when I finally heard somebody say it clearly, with no background noise!
The good part, of course, is the interesting story line.  Some of the acting was weak at times, some good.  The fight scenes were unintentionally hilarious.  The scenery and costumes were beautiful.",1462406400,,785,4.9541984732824424
