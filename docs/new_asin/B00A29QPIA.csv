8546135,1,B00A29QPIA,"I had a friend who bought this set to teach her kids, and so I bought it to help teach my baby Tagalog. I speak limited Tagalog but can understand fluently, so I hoped this would help me teach my baby girl. Started out ok when the 2 dinosaurs said ""Kamusta"" to each other. Then they go up a balloon and one looks through a telescope and spots something far away and says to the other dinosaur ""Ano yan?"" instead of saying the  ""Ano (i)yon?"". (""iyan"" refers to ""that thing close to you"" when speaking to someone. ""Iyon"" refers to ""that thing far away from either of us""). But whatever, maybe they just didn't have a native speaker watch the episode itself and it had looked ok on paper.

So then they go through animals, and my husband (who speaks fluent Tagalog but I cannot get him to speak to our daughter in Tagalog lol) immediately became annoyed and said ""Are they just making up Tagalog words?"". You see, the DVD goes through this whole lesson of animals, and a lot of the animals there are not indigenous to the Philippines so there aren't Tagalog words for them. And what happens when there aren't Tagalog words? You say that word in English with a Tagalog accent. It's fine if it's just a few words because it's good to get acquainted with that aspect of Tagalog speaking anyway, but essentially a huge amount of words is dedicated to teaching kids how to say English words with a Tagalog accent. It became obvious then that this program is a template used for all their languages.

Unfortunately, this program comes across as not very well thought out for Tagalog learning, and almost like they slapped the languages on top of the template to make a quick buck (and the animation is pretty bad actually. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned something about the animation being intentionally used as filler to make it seem longer). I put this away and instead sat my husband down and convinced him of the benefits to a child of being bilingual and now we are speaking to her in Tagalog instead :)",1469404800,,2008,4.495890410958904
8546136,5,B00A29QPIA,My kids love this video and they picked up Tagalog really easily. So happy that I purchased this for them. Now I can start teaching them more words and sentences.,1416355200,,162,4.433333333333334
8546137,1,B00A29QPIA,"My kids (7 & 5) hate it when I make them watch Dino Lingo.  There is a lot of time that is spent on dancing dinosaurs and other ""entertaining"" things that have no language learning at all. It's like they added a bunch of filler to make people think that it is longer and therefore better.
And the dinosaurs in the pictures are cute, but they are not in the videos that much.  Instead a whole bunch of other poorly made computer animated characters are added in, with some footage of actual people/objects.  When you consider how expensive the product is, I don't feel like this was money well spent.  If the information was presented in a more organized way, and there was less time wasted then I'd feel like I had made a good investment.  I'd be less disappointed if i had only paid $30 for the DVD's.
Anytime they said more than 2 words at once they didn't give you enough time to repeat them before they changed screens and said a new phrase you were supposed to attempt.
My kids prefer some free tagalog videos on youtube by ""Evans Nanay"".  The lady who does them should make her own DVD set.  She does a great job.
My toddler however, will sit and watch Dino lingo.  The instrumental theme music is catchy, so if you have a kid who is 4 or younger, I'd say these could be helpful for you, but they are still way over prices for what you get.",1389225600,2,1346,4.271653543307087
8546138,2,B00A29QPIA,"I bought the Hebrew version of the Dino Lingo Program. I was very disappointed with the quality of the product. The flash cards were printed like business cards, they were not laminated, but had a cheap glossy finish. The cards had a big Dino Lingo label on the front which is distracting to the student trying to read the word. I have never seen educational flash cards with a label so distracting for the reader next to the word they are trying to learn. They would not last more that one school year seeing they can be ripped in half by children. The posters were nice, and high quality visual aids. Overall for the price it was not up to quality. Way overpriced for what you get. I do not recommend and will have to return for a refund.",1358035200,4,740,4.330935251798561
8546139,5,B00A29QPIA,"We just got our Dino Lingo in Tagalog! I am so excited to use this with my kids! I went through the package and everything that was promised is here and it got here so fast! I ordered Thursday and it was here Monday! My kids are going to love this, and they'll be able to talk to their grandparents in their native language which will make them happy too! Thank you for making such a great product to make learning another language fun for kids!!!",1355788800,3,447,4.209302325581396
8546140,5,B00A29QPIA,My daughter (4 yrs old) and son (2 years old) loves Dino Lingo! They learned so fast and enjoy watching it. Thank you for an awesome product. I would highly recommend this to my friends. Super fast shipping too.,1355270400,3,211,4.435897435897436
