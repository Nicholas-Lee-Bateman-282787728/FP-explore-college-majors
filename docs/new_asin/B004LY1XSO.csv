8435299,2,B004LY1XSO,"What can you say about a rushed into production, quickie documentary that contains no music, amateur editing and a clown car full of D-List ""experts"" to provide a narcoleptic peek at one of rock's ""Mt. Rushmore"" level luminaries. Under the unfocused tutelage of bottom feeder television director Joel Gilbert (Elvis Found Alive, Bigfoot, Tales From The Crypt) the overall production values of Bob Dylan Revealed are more reminiscent of a grainy 1985 ""grandpa has the shakes "" Camcorder Christmas memory than anything resembling a polished, well-researched visual exposition.

Much too much time is spent listening to the extended ramblings of tertiary Dylan players with an interminable focus on Dylan's 1966 ""Goes Electric"" tour with the Hawks/The Band.  Minutes roll by watching Dylan staring out of train and airline windows looking bored and exhausted  while Hawks drummer Mickey Jones overlays a perfunctory and monotonous narrative to the proceedings. Things don't get much better as we segue to 1975's Rolling Thunder Tour where fuzzy Super-8 tapes render the legendary performances as a cataract diffused rumor with no accompanying soundtrack. If Gilbert didn't have the rights to the music, why bother?

As for the commentary, the less said the better. All too often the fanboy experts are reduced to tasty pabulum such as ""Dylan's really just amazing,"" or ""We knew we were in the presence of a legend."" Bob Dylan Revealed adds nothing to the Dylan canon and as a result, I'll offer some advice that I should have taken... just because something is free (On Demand) doesn't mean that it is more valuable than your time. If you're looking for an inside look at Dylan worthy of the subject, my money remains on Martin Scorsese's still seminal No Direction Home.",1443657600,,1768,5.128472222222222

8435302,4,B004LY1XSO,"There is some new footage and there are some new interviews. There is a bit of new info as well. If you're a Dylan fan it's a definite good buy. If you don't own any Dylan bio DVDs, though, get Scorsese's ""No Direction Home"".",1353196800,2,225,4.136363636363637
8435303,3,B004LY1XSO,"I did learn a lot about my man in the '60s and early '70s.  I didn't follow his career much after that, so I found this an easy way to catch up, although the DVD does not cover his comeback in 1997.  Many talking heads, including various band members, and occasional short interviews from the past provided lots of little details and yet so much was left out too.

The editing could have been tighter to make the 110 minutes less boring; I also didn't like the style of the choppy editing and the lack of a central narrator to fill in and make the transitions smoother and easier to follow.  And why must we see the interviewer?  Overall, a low budget feel to the production, like his main focus was to have fun with it.

Another disappointment was the lack of any of Dylan's music actually performed by Dylan.  There are some detailed reviews on line you can find by doing a Google search, if you're considering a purchase.  Nice that our library had a copy to view.",1314403200,5,967,4.363128491620111
8435304,3,B004LY1XSO,"Anthing involving Bob Dylan inherently cannot be without some interest.
However, this DCDE is mostly interviews with Dylan acyolites and people who knew him before he was DYLAN.
Woefully little actual Dylan footage other than homemade, out of focus and soundless movies and clips of press conferences viewable in their entirety elsewhere.
All in all, I hate to say it but I was bored.",1312156800,9,384,5.015625
