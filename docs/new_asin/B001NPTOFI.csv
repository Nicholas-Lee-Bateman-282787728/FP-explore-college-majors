8327761,2,B001NPTOFI,From the write up I expected it to be more graphic. It was not. This is definitely a movie that you have to watch while tripping. It was disconnected and mind bending and i didn't see enough of Dita Von Teese.,1297900800,3,209,4.121951219512195
8327762,3,B001NPTOFI,"Being a semi-fan of Redemption Films (tho lately they have released/re-released some questionable titles, and this may be one of them), I had no idea who Dita was, and still don`t. I purchased it for a reasonable price from a seller on Amazon, and it`s not as bad as stated in the other review, tho it WAS bad, but if you`re reading this, you probably knew that already. We fans of exploitation,horror,cult,and Eurosleaze search these things out, rather than succumb to what`s currently being offered by Hollywood for the last 25 years or so. Sure, Andrew Blake has been making great soft and hardcore videos (not films) for almost 20 years that I know of, but they`re almost all the same, and I don`t mean that in a bad way. And I suppose if you knew who Dita was (one of tens of thousands of women in this country who can`t act and has no other apparant skills on display other than prancing around in various states of undress for the sole purpose of a paycheck - and again, I don`t necessarily mean that in a bad way...), this might disappoint because she`s actually attempting to act in a slice of softcore sleaze that masquerades as a film, and she isn`t naked often enough for a fan, then I understand. But for fans of Redemption films and exploitation in general, you could do a lot worse. Try 'One Eyed Monster' on for size as proof...",1248825600,6,1344,4.489795918367347
8327763,1,B001NPTOFI,"Had good hopes for this one... but was really dissapointed!
I am a huge Dita fan, and really... I do not know what she was thinking when she decided on this one. Bad acting, not enough Dita doing what she does best, it was just plain strange. If you want to see Dita on film, any other will be a better choice. Unless you're into long scenes of drug use, Long scenes of Dita talking on cellphones in the back of a car, and other nonsense... Trust me, you don't need this one. Go find Andrew Blake's ""Pinups 2"" and have fun with that!",1248048000,13,533,4.134615384615385
