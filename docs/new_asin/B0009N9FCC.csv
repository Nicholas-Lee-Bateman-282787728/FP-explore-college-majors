8063437,4,B0009N9FCC,"Burnett Show #1: Legendary entertainer Pearl Bailey & semi-regular Tim Conway are guests in a Fall 1972 show. It begins with a hysterical ""Sunset Boulevard"" sketch about network executive Tim convincing Nora Desmond (Carol) to appear in a bug commercial. What makes this sketch memorable are some unintentional boo-boo's (including Harvey Korman as butler ""Max"" injuring himself in a tender spot with a fake sword). Carol & Pearl are in a comedy sketch which turns musical. Tim reprises his ""oldest man"" character--this time, on a slave barge. Not the funniest of these bits; however, Harvey starts laughing the moment Tim enters the set. Then Carol plays a woman seeking help from attorney F. Lee Bunny (Tim in bunny makeup, and milking it for all it's worth). The show's finale pays tribute to the studio Twentieth-Century Fox.
Show #2: Returning guests are Eydie Gorme & Paul Sand from Fall 1973. Includes: Husband Harvey trying to placate loud-mouthed wife Carol at a diner; Harvey in an entertaining musical excerpt from his film ""Huckleberry Finn""; Carol & Paul as newlyweds on the road, and getting ""honeymooner's anxiety"" in a major way; and an amusing finale paying tribute to famous film series (""Dr. Kildare"", ""Tarzan"", ""The Wolf Man"", and ""The Bowery Boys"").
It's standard Burnett Show fare, but pretty enjoyable.",1247616000,,1325,5.138888888888889
