This movie is based on the autobiographical book by Chris Oyler, about an inspirational AIDS drama (to say the least). Claire and Greg Madison discover that their hemophiliac son Ben has contracted the deadly virus through a tainted transfusion. Faced with the likelihood that Ben will not live out the year, the Madisons vow to make every day of that year count and to see to it that their son will not have to endure his trials alone.

This is one of the movies that I love and tolerate the most. I'm not a big fan of one of the main characters dying at the end of a movie. But if it leads to something positive and inspirational, I can't help but love it. I remember when this was a made for TV movie in 1988 and our whole family watching it. And from that, I remember the film clearly to this day.  Through the ""bitter-sweet"" positive nature the film left us, I couldn't help but feel that there were some of the scenes on there hit pretty close to home...I grew up with doctors telling me I had 6 months left to live. But I ended up surprising all of the doctors and I'm still going strong today. But in my most trialed times when I was going through medical problems, I would always think about something more positive like puppies, ice cream, and in my worst moments, Jesus. Not all children are as lucky as I am, but I believe that all kids need SOMETHING to look forward to in their future. This is one of the few movies to do all of that. It touches all lives both young and old to prepare for something that will eventually happen to all of us.",1126656000,36,1642,4.321428571428571
499987,5,6302714672,"I saw this movie several times when it originally came out. It was beautiful. I helped explain the process of death, and the need for closure. As the parents told their son, he was safe, and ""Go Towards the Light,"" what a wonderful gift - permission to die. This movie can be used with children who are terminal to teach them not to be afraid of death. Everyone should watch this movie - more then once.",1119052800,16,403,4.315789473684211
499988,5,6302714672,"a beautifully written movie, about a child with Aids and how the family coped and taught the child to die.  Saw the nivie when it came out back in '88?  could not forget it and when i viewed it again , it had the same effect.  Sweet, powerful, loving.  A movie you won't quickly forget.",1115683200,12,286,4.1454545454545455

I happen to have one BRAND NEW STILL SEALED but I can't put it on the Amazon marketplace since I live in Canada (product doesn't exist in the Canadian search engine).

499990,5,6302714672,"The other reviews here say it very well. So pardon me if I vent a little: Why is a marvelous movie like this not in DVD? What irks me is that so much idiotic drivel (such as ""The Real World"" or ""American Idol"") seem to pop right onto DVD, while the best things are often left in the can somewhere in a dusty archive waiting for a building fire.",1050624000,8,344,4.0
499991,5,6302714672,This is the most amazing film I have ever watched! Similar to The Cure it is both heart felt and true to life. Everyone can get something from this well acted and scripted drama. I highly recommend it!,1012694400,5,201,4.315789473684211
499992,5,6302714672,"This movie had to be the best tear-jerker I have ever seen.  It is full of situations that no parent would ever want to be in, but once faced with the delima, what else could a parent do, but give their child ""the hand of love"".  To help thier child go through the transaction from life to death with the comfort of knowing that there is something more and death is just the beginning of life. This movie shows love in the purest and most unselfish sence of the word.  Great for the whole family, it will make you want to draw close to each other knowing that everyday is a gift and that we are not promised tomorrow and that our family and friends should be treated and loved as if today was their last day.",998265600,6,708,4.153284671532846

7829927,5,6302714672,"I own this movie on DVD when it first was offered via Amazon.  The basic message of the movie was moving and taught the child not to be afraid to go onto the next step (whatever it might be).  Giving the OK, to die without fear.

The only fault is the part of making such a deal about how Mormons believe this and that.  As an ex, I can tell you that there are too many who are uncaring, cold and only if you belong to their religion do they feel you will receive your proper rewards after death.

But for those of us ex-Mormons, who can get past that part this is a great movie to watch.

The lessons it gives to those left behind are critical.  Even if you don't believe in God at all, though in this movie it is important to them, it's focus is on a much bigger picture.

It is about the person who is facing their last moments on this earth (no one actually knows what comes next) THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT IT IS OK LET GO -- TO DO SO WITHOUT FEAR AND AS THE MOVIE SAYS ""GO TOWARDS THE LIGHT"" (WHATEVER THAT MAY BE).

Though it breaks the hearts of those left behind, they must sometimes give permission (if you will) for their loved one to ""let go and move on"". (I have had several friends who have had to do this).

Buy the movie, learn from it (if needed) and yes it will make you cry, but it is worth it.

Blessed Be!",1365724800,4,1322,3.9696969696969697
7829928,5,6302714672,It is a very moving story about a young boy who suffered an unfortunate fate. It occurs when Ryan White first started fighting to stay in school.  The actors played their part to perfection.,1364688000,,190,4.588235294117647
7829929,1,6302714672,This is an excellent movie.  But the price that's being asked for it is just plain ridiculous.  I will wait until I can get a copy for $20.00.  I don't know how these people can sleep at night.  They should wear masks!!!,1300924800,3,220,4.166666666666667
