2569867,5,B000FKO3HG,"I was a big fan of this series when it first aired in the 80's. Like almost all of the fans I supported the effort to bring it back to life.  Now twenty years later and purchasing all of the DVD sets, I can only say again that I'm sorry to see that it's over.

For those who haven't seen the show, season four continued the excellent plot lines and easy banter between the stars.  The truncated season five was made up of three two-part episodes.  I could have done without the Roselli character put in as a rival love interest for Laura.  This may have influenced my rating of this set, but you aren't allowed half star rating so I went with the five star rating.

They did however bring a conclusion to the series and that is what's important.  Now I can pull out the season one DVDs and start watching all over again.

Highly recommended for season four.  Season five is a reserved recommendation but since they are packaged together you don't have a choice.

I just had an additional thought.  Since all the stars are still alive, I'd like to see a 2 hour made for television movie that takes place 20+ years later.  Maybe with the children grown and ready to take over Remington Steele Investigations.",1157414400,22,1206,4.407239819004525
2569868,4,B000FKO3HG,"This collection is definitely worth having for any Remington Steele fan, but with the last two seasons of the series together in one set, it's a very uneven package. If I could break it down, I would give 5 stars to Season 4, 2 stars to Season 5, and 3 stars to the extras.

Season 4 is not the best of the series. The show had already passed its peak, but it was still quite good. The season has some classic episodes, including ""Beg, Borrow or Steele,"" in which Laura and Mr. Steele are presumed dead and Mildred is arrested for their murder, ""Dancer, Prancer, Donner and Steele,"" the Christmas episode in which the gang is taken hostage by a bunch of Santas, and ""Sensitive Steele,"" the most in-depth exploration of The Relationship that we ever get on the show. Other episodes like ""Coffee, Tea, or Steele,"" ""Steele Blushing,"" ""Steele at Your Service,"" ""Forged Steele,"" and ""Steele in the Running"" are very strong as well. Even the weaker episodes like ""Suburban Steele"" and ""Steele Inc."" have their moments. And although as some other reviewers have pointed out, the series has started to look more dated and less ""classic"" by the fourth year, overall, it still has its trademark charm, wit, and sophistication.

As for character development in Season 4, Mildred discovers the secret that Mr. Steele was invented by Miss Holt, and so the dynamic among the three changes a bit. The relationship between Laura and Mr. Steele also develops a little over the course of the season, but as is usual with this show, we are given just enough to make us want more, and never enough to satisfy. Often referred to as a show about ""foreplay,"" RS delivers by not delivering. Season 4 provides plenty of little romantic moments to keep us intrigued with the couple--and we even see them admitting to other people that they're ""committed"" to each other--but they still never consummate the relationship. Yes, as some have complained, if you think about it, it is bizarre that two healthy adults could have such a hot and heavy romance for four years and still remain chaste, but you're not really supposed to think about it too much. That's why, with few exceptions, only a minute or two per episode is devoted to the relationship. The tease does, perhaps, start to wear a little thin in Season 4. If the show had continued another full year, at some point they would have had to fish or cut bait with the relationship. But for me, the amazing chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist keeps me coming back for more throughout the fourth season, even when I realize I'm being played a little by writers who wanted to have their cake and eat it too.

By the time we reach the fifth season, however, everything has changed. As others have mentioned, the show was cancelled after the fourth season, and as with most things that come back from the dead, it's never the same again. The mercifully short fifth season has a very ""we don't want to be here"" feel to it. Exotic locations serve as poor substitutes for good story-telling and character development. The plots become thin and tedious. The humor goes from clever to overly silly and farcical. The characters are inconsistent with previous seasons. And the inclusion of Jack Scalia (Tony) in the cast totally throws off the dynamic that worked so well in what was a classy, silver-screen-inspired romantic duet. Basically, the show lost its heart. The fans did not get an emotionally satisfying ending, and it still makes me a little bitter after all these years.

The extras are about the same as the other seasons, just a little less. I know you can't expect that much from the extras for such an old show, and well, you don't get that much. There are a few featurettes that are okay. The Farewell to Steele one did make me very nostalgic and sad to see the series come to an end (again). I give the extras three stars instead of two, because of these featurettes, and especially because they were able to get interviews with all three of the stars. That's probably a big coup for such an old show.

What I didn't care for much in the extras were the episode commentaries. I already mentioned this in my review of Season 3, but I REALLY wish whoever is in charge of putting together extras for dvds like this would send the commentors a copy ahead of time so they could take 45 minutes to watch a show before doing commentary on it. It is not interesting to listen to people guessing about plot points they don't remember for an episode that you have just watched. You expect to hear something interesting, and it's a little insulting to the viewer for the commentors to ramble on, laugh at in-jokes, constantly interrupt each other, etc.--basically to do a terrible job. What's even more annoying in one commentary was a guy who actually joked about a what a bad job they were doing. Yes, it's hilarious to waste the time of people who support the show and who spent good money on these dvds. Anyway, I'm not saying there are not some good bits of information on the commentaries, but they're few and far between.

Overall, though, the disappointing final season and poor commentary skills of people involved in the series take away little from these dvds or the series as a whole. It's great to have the whole set, a wealth of wonderful episodes--all 94--right there in a nice, convenient package, to return to whenever I want. But I'm also a little wistful that this is the last set. Seeing my favorite childhood show on dvd for the first time was as close as I can ever get to recapturing the magic of watching it when it originally aired. Now that I've savored every episode--the good, the bad, and the big-haired--it's sad to have to say goodbye again.",1156982400,11,5717,4.6386969397828235
2569869,5,B000FKO3HG,"I loved the Remington Steele series and still do.  I had no idea what a huge impact Laura Holt made on my little junior high and highschool life until I watched the shows as an adult woman.  She was strong, smart, and classy, and that's what I wanted to be.  To this day I love a man in cuff links.  My husband has a huge collection and now he knows why (seeing that I make him watch all the DVD's with me).  I always adored the witty banter  and the quarky situations that Laura, Mildred, and Steele ended up in and I don't care if season 4 and 5 don't meet the standards of the originals.  These DVD's always bring a smile to my face and give my husband and I something witty to watch around 5:oo when all that is on is a two hour stint of ""Seventh Heaven.""",1154995200,10,759,4.02
2569870,5,B000FKO3HG,"I've been watching TV from its early days in the 1950s through the present and am convinced that Remington Steele was as good as general audience TV gets. In fact, I think it was the best TV series ever made. Remington Steele was a suberbly done combination of action, adventure, and romantic comedy with very good scripts and fine acting by attractive and appealing people. It was -- and still is -- consistently entertaining and no other series was better. I agree that the addition of Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs made the second and later seasons even better than the first season, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first season. If you are a fan of Remington Steele you've probably already bought the DVDs of the first three seasons and you'll love this final release too. If you've never seen Remington Steele or have forgotten how good this show was, please do yourself a favor and order this DVD set now. Better still, order the earlier releases to enjoy now while you're waiting for this set of the final two seasons to be released.",1152403200,12,1038,4.646739130434782
2569871,4,B000FKO3HG,"The debonair ex-con-man and strait-laced detective return in the last two seasons of ""Remington Steele,"" where Steele and Laura solve new mysteries -- and uncover old ones. While the final season is weak compared to the previous ones, the last two seasons are still quite enjoyable and amusing.

As the season opens, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) returns to England, trying to keep Steele (Pierce Brosnan) from running afoul of Scotland yard. He's masquerades as an assassin while looking for clues to his past -- and a murder happens. But even back in America, their problems don't cease -- and some of them are very funny.

Among other things, the agency investigate a wrestler, missing experimental pigs, faux obituaries, a body that fell onto a airline luggage carousel, a self-improvement spa where ""accidents"" keep happening, tell-tale butlers, missing caviar, and deal with an inept would-be detective whose latest scheme gets a man killed. Steele and Laura are even declared dead -- and Mildred (Doris Roberts) is the prime suspect in their ""murder.""

And on the personal front, Laura finds a doctored photo of her in a porno, Steele apparently gambles away the agency, and Mildred becomes a radio star. But the fourth season takes a nasty turn when Steele finds that he'll be deported unless he gets a green card -- and it seems that Laura is the only one available...

The fifth season was done for contractual reasons, and the stars didn't want to do it, since it led to them losing out on roles they wanted. So, they only did a trio of movies, which rather hastily wrap up the threads of the series -- mainly Steele's past, Steele and Laura's relationship. It's very light on detective work, but it does give us a satisfactory finale.

It seems that their faux honeymoon will be as peaceful as their job. Nasty insurance agent Norman Keyes (James Tolkan) is hounding Steele, and an Immigration officer is trying to woo Laura -- and get Steele out of the picture. And then their ""marriage"" is put to the test when a DIFFERENT woman claims to be Steele's wife. And in the two-hour finale, the duo discover the truth about Steele's inheritance and past... and finally deal with their tempestuous half-relationship.

The fifth half-season is a half-hearted, rushed finale to the series, but it does manage to wrap things up in a way that viewers will enjoy -- especially the final scenes. But the season preceding it is quite solid, with its mixture of romantic comedy, action and mystery.

Okay, few of these mysteries actually resemble anything in real life -- although the pirated music one is pretty entertaining, as is the one where Laura moonlights as a stewardess. But the mysteries are all tightly-written and intelligent, and even the fifth season's more drawn-out episodes are still fairly entertaining.

The writers had perfected the mix of comedy and mystery, and weren't afraid to be bizarre (gunsel Santas?). Not to mention that solid, moderately witty dialogue. (""If I were a man would you question it if I told you I was going to enter the Boston Marathon?"" ""I would question why anyone would want to run 26 miles without being chased!"").

Laura and Steele finally deal with their tangled, complex relationship, after a stint at a ""relationship issues"" seminar that explodes in their faces. But fortunately the details of Steele's past seems to help. And secretary Mildred gets to be a bit more independent, dealing with a crooked televangelist and working as a hard-love radio commentator.

""Remington Steele"" ended on a middling note, but the fourth and fifth seasons are ""steele"" entertaining viewing. Definitely worth seeing.",1152316800,56,3656,4.968903436988543
2569872,2,B000FKO3HG,"Something went terribly wrong between season three and four of this otherwise wonderful series. The ratings plummeted as a result (poorer scripts, marked indifference in the actor's performances, etc), and the show was canceled. Fortunately (or UNfortunately, depending on your point of view), Brosnan was under consideration at the time for the new James Bond, and NBC in their infinite ""wisdom"" brought the series back for a ""fifth"" season. In reality, it was only a series of 2 hour made for TV movies, showing Steele and Holt in their ""married life"". These movies were laughable and did not do justice to the series.

My rating for this is actually 2 1/2 (Amazon does not allow half stars), 3 stars for Season 4, 2 stars for Season 5. Do yourself a favor and purchase Seasons 1 - 3, and only buy this DVD if you are a huge a RS fan, otherwise you'll be disappointed.",1151971200,9,870,4.64935064935065
2569873,5,B000FKO3HG,"I have waited 20 years to own this entire series. I made my family crazy trying to record the reruns from CBN while editing the commercials, in the mid-eighties. They bleeped almost all of one episode due to the strip club scenes. This is a delightful series that I watched with my 3 year old at bedtime. Season 5 or the ""mini-series"" was satisfying except for Laura's long lost Father. That was the only loose end. I thought it was clever that her real dad played Steele's dad. So fans, what was his real name? My guess, Harry Chalmers.",1151884800,10,537,4.434343434343434
2569874,5,B000FKO3HG,"I am a big Remington Steele fan and loved ""Season 5."" Season 4 was fantastic, but it was at this time that Pierce was up for the role of James Bond and NBC was not certain if they wanted to renew the show. Bonds of Steele, the last episode had great ratings which led to the mini series called season 5 to tie up the show. I loved the fact that after Steele had so many ex-girlfriends, it was time for Laura to have a serious suitor as well. Check out the excellent comedic timing between Pierce and Stephanie in ""Steele Hanging in There"" when the Steeles' return from their honeymoon and throw a dinner party for Gladys Lynch. Also check out the wonderful wardrobe for both. In earlier seasons, the network wanted Stephanie to have a hipper wardrobe. I love the return of her hats and more elegant outfits. Pierce's suites are are gorgeous as well! I will be glad to finally have this on DVD!",1149379200,11,893,4.3532934131736525
2569875,5,B000FKO3HG,"I can't give this collection less than five stars despite the mostly horrible Season 5 included in the series.  Steele, I would rather have Season 5 than not.  I'm just thankful I will have the entire series on DVD as of August 15, 2006 and can finally retire my deteriorating video tapes forever.

2569876,4,B000FKO3HG,"This review contains spoilers because I just cannot contain my surprise at Season 5!

I'm fairly new to the show, but not so new as not to hear the lambasting Season 5 recieves. All I've heard about is how Rem and Laura should never have been married etc etc, so here I am picturing a watered down version of the show while the couple sit at home flipping through the channels.... what all the reviews do NOT mention (for some reason) was the delicious circumstance that produces the marriage! I will stop short of spilling all the beans however, their marriage of RELUCTANCE is a hell of a lot more fun than many of dull Season 4 episodes! Hell, I even like Jack Scalia.

Season 4 had it's share of high points; like Forged Steele, but I found far far too many weak scripts and MANY that did NOTHING for the Rem and Laura relationship (the reason I watch this show). I found Season 5's Mexico debut ""The Steele That Wouldn't Die"" to be as fun and as good as anything the series had produced in turn I found Season 4's opener ""Steele Searching"" to be a real mess that did NOT live up to the story elements set up by Season 3's conclusion.

However you look at it, this season with all its backstory is well worth the $20 it currently goes for. I seriously doubt either Zimbalist nor Brosnan will ever don these characters again so these episodes are sands in an hour glass that must be turned over and viewed again and again.",1148601600,3,1425,4.349624060150376

2569896,4,B000FKO3HG,"I'm not going to go into the details of the show, as others have done that, and I have in another review - that was mostly from the very first episode; ""License to Steele"", from the first year.
I'm presently watching the last season, 5.  Season 4, I can give a thumbs up, but on season 5, perhaps they were just letting us fans down easily; but I just have one episode to go, and for one thing, the humor isn't there.  And, I totally could have done without Tony Scalia.  I wish they could have written the stories, without including him, in some way.  Or perhaps have picked out another actor.  He just doesn't have the class that Remington Steele has.
And, I guess what bothers me most with season 5, and even the previous seasons, is that Remington is always getting into predicaments, which get him into trouble with Laura.  But, the predicaments in many cases are not his fault.  Like Sarah Douglas showing up in his bedroom.  He had absolutely nothing to do with it, but he doesn't explain these things well to Laura.  And, then Laura and Remington seeming to always be smooching with someone, even though they're supposed to be married.
I don't know, maybe by the time the show was ""uncancelled"", they didn't have time to write better stories.  But, the humor is definitely gone, and that was one of the things that was so enjoyable about the show.  That and the good mysteries.
Season 4 is much better, and more along the lines of the traditional Steele shows from the previous two years.  Though I do have to say, in ""Sensitive Steele"", they probably have my least favorite show of the 4 1/2 year run.  I just can't get into psychological shows, even on Remington Steele.  And, the primal scream thing is really stupid.  I worked at an institute for 14 years, though on the computers, thankfully.  So, I do have some insight on it.  But, on the other hand, season 4 has probably my favorite Remington show of all time, and that is the one where Laura's sister's family moves out to CA so that her husband can teach at USC.  Then uh, oh, the kids have left for school and hubby for work, and low and behold, Laura's sister finds a man dying in her kitchen.  She calls Laura, of course, and by the time Laura gets there, the body disappears, only to be found later on in a trash can by Mr. Steele.  Then it gets into multi-level marketing and the company behind it, but what is really humorous in this adventure are the three Japanese PI's, who are in LA for a PI convention.  Mildred runs into them, covering for Mr. Steele, and brings them by the office, and they are thrilled to be able to visit famous American PI Remington Steele's office, and they become an integral part of the plot later on.  But, they are a hoot!  Also, a hoot, at the end of season 4 was the Mexican ""acting"" boat captain, who married Laura & Remington, and his musical entertainment.  We get his versions of ""Feelings"" and ""Laura"", just to mention a couple.
I do recommend watching this entire DVD, has you want to wrap it all up, if you've watched all the episodes, like I have.  I watched a bunch 30 years ago, when it was originally on NBC.  And, then have watched them all again, except 3 from season 3 which I don't have access to yet, but will soon.
I also understand that we find out who Remington's biological father was, which would be worth the price of the DVDs in itself, for me.  So, season 4, I give a 5; though I don't think it is quite as good as the previous 2 seasons.  Season 5, I give about a 3 - simply because so far, and I have 1.5 hours left to watch, the humor is gone, and unfortunately replaced by bickering.
If you want to watch the best of this show - watch show #1, and then seasons 2 through 4, if you have to be selective.  To me, the show got much better once James Read and Mrs. Fox left the show, and were replaced by Doris Roberts.  Doris was great on the show, IMO.
I hate to give this DVD a 4, but I'd rate the 5 seasons in the following order 4,5,5,5,4.  But, absolutely loved the show.  Was so disappointed when I heard it was cancelled.  It helped bring NBC's rating up from last to first, but you can see how much respect the show got for doing that - cancellation.  It had a 28 share when it was cancelled.  I read that this morning.
Also, did you know this show was conceived in the mind of long time TV director Robert Butler in 1969, and was thought to be ahead of its time?  When Butler and Grant Tinker brought a pilot back in the early January 1980, they felt TV was ready for it, and the rest was history. (The pilot was eventually made into the episode, Tempered Steel - then they did a second pilot, which was the initial show, License to Steele.)

**EDIT**Well, I just got finished watching the entire set of seasons 4 and 5, and I must say, I was a little hasty with my initial review of season 5.  Episode 3 from Season 5 easily makes up for the shortcomings in the first two episodes of Season 5, in my book.  In it, Mr. Steele inherits a castle from the Earl of Claridge, partly because of what Daniel and he did, when those miners were trying to kill him at the beginning of season 4.  And, partly because, though the Earl never found his illegimate son, he felt this made him feel closer to the boy.
The humor is back - one of the funny things is each department of the castle, upon greeting Mr. Steele, gives him an astronomical bill, as their services hadn't been paid for in something like 59 years.  When Mr. Steele asked the head Butler why they still worked there, though they hadn't been paid in 59 years he replied something to the effect ""Well, in our way of thinking, having a job is better than having no job at all"".  They were all very pleasant to Mr. Steele.  But, the real Remington is back in this episode, the humor, the mystery (in this case espionage), and the feeling.  I felt it ended on a very up note, though a little sad in some ways.  And I highly recommend getting the whole set.  You can watch many of these online, but sitting through the commercials is murder.  It is much harder to find Seasons 4 and 5 online.  So, that is why I'd recommend getting the whole set.  A wonderful show like this will never happen again, with the direction TV is going nowadays.  So, keep these for posterity's sake.  I sure hope after I buy the whole set on DVD, they don't decide to release them in blu ray!  By the way, for regular DVD's, the picture is very good.  I could get the picture to fill the screen on my 16:9 LCD screen in my bedroom.  But, couldn't get any better than 4:3 on my laptop.  But, there is probably a way to get 16:9, I just haven't figured it out yet.  So, I have Season 3 on the way, and already have 4 & 5, and eventually will get Seasons 1 and 2.
OK, two other matters of business before I finish, and the last is a spoiler alert so be ready.  I forgot to mention that in the season 5 DVD, we have more of that despicable Norman Keyes.  All I'll say is, he tries to set the boss up for murder.  Will he be successful, and what will happen to Mr. Keyes?  Get season 4 to find out.

Finally, the spoiler alert.  SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!  Finally, in the very last episode, we find out who the real biological father of Remington is, and why Mr. Steele doesn't know who he is and his own name.  Well, let me stop short of telling you who it is, get the DVD to find out.  But, it goes down like this.  It is someone Remington already knows, and he seems to be dying of some lung ailment.  He sits Remington down and tells him, and then says we should make a toast.  At this point Remy pours out the beverages, but when he goes back to his father, his father has passed.  So, he never finds out his real name.  As he was walking back to his father he was mentioning that he always wanted to know something (which was probably his real name).  But alas, he never found out.  Now to me, I will always think of his real name as being ""Harold"" and then this man's last name.  Since he liked to call Remington by that name.  I gave it away, didn't I?  I'm sorry.  But, I just wanted to put my 2 cents in on his possible real name.  And, will Laura and Remy get officially married?  I'll let you get the DVD to find out.  END OF SPOILER ALERT!

I'm not changing my rating, but I highly recommend the DVD set - if only for Season 4 and the last episode of the series in year 5.  Get it at the best price you can and enjoy!!!",1412726400,,8402,4.207759699624531

2569935,1,B000FKO3HG,"Season 1,2, and 3 are awsome. I love the first three seasons of this show, it's a romantic comedy with mysteries thrown in for the fun of it. Laura Holt has created this fake boss, who comes to life in a jewel thief. And for the first three seasons, Laura and Remington are chasing each other, as they solve mysteries. Then came season four, which in and of itself, isn't horrible, nor is it great. And in my humble opinion, the series should have ended with season four. Instead of the fake trumped up wedding between Laura and remington on a ship just so remington doesn't have to get his green card, I would have had a real wedding to end it. But instead, we get season five. Which totally goes in a different direction of the previous seasons, they are trailed by an ins agent. To try to catch Remington and Laura not acting like a married couple, so they can deport him. As has been previously stated, this was an attempt by the studio, to promote the actor playing the INS agent. Needless to say, he's terrible. And never really did anything else after the show, anyway. Remember how Laura was always chasing Remington, and that she only had eyes for him. Well in season five, she falls in love with the INS agent. And actually contemplates leaving Remington, the history behind the show is that season three was supposed to be the final show. But, at the last minute. The Studio wanted one more season, so season four. They again tried to end it, by this time. All the actors involved were wanting to end it, so the studio ordered an abbreviated season 5, actually 3 2 part movies. And it's dissappointing, by the time you get to season 4 and five, Pierce and Stephanie look bored and worn out with their parts. Yes season 4 has it's moments, but they're few far and between. I don't even watch season five, I can barely stand season four.",1327622400,5,1846,4.432352941176471

After watching it for a long time while it was still showing regularly on TV, I began taping it to VHS when I found channels re-running it.  I had a lot of tapes.  I then discovered Columbia House had it on VHS, so I bought a couple of those.  They were a waste of money.  When I started seeing old shows come out on DVD, I started looking for my favorite.

2569947,4,B000FKO3HG,"By the fourth season of this very entertaining show, much of the bloom was off the rose. The off air tension between the leads was making it onto the screen. Often they were able to keep it from showing through, but not always. The on again, off again romance between ""Remington"" and Laura Holt continued to run frustratingly hot and cold. The mysteries, however, continued to be off beat, funny, and interesting.

Season Five, however, was really a disaster. It was really just three two hour movies. There was absolutely no chemistry left at all between Piers Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist, and most of the time they didn't even appear on-screen together. The stories were forced and came across as exactly what they were ... marking time to fill out the contract.

Stephanie went on to appear in one forgettable TV movie after another, along with a few TV series guest starring roles. Piers went on to become major motion picture box office magic, including four very popular James Bond films. He was the second ""Bond"" to have been delayed from the role by a TV series contract, similar to Roger Moore's situation regarding ""The Saint"". I've always wondered if this disparity in future prospects was telegraphed to everyone late in the series, and caused Stephanie to be somewhat bitter in the last two years. That would explain a lot.

There is a lot of conjecture about whether there really was off screen antagonism between Zimbalist and Brosnan. I think the fact that they virtually never share a scene together in the fifth season movies gives a big hint as to the truth about that.",1312761600,3,1592,4.781818181818182

I'm glad that the fans at the time went into an uproar when the show got cancelled . . . enough that they produced 6 more shows in Season 5 to wrap the story up.

There are also some old interviews with show producers and some narrations on some of the episodes.

2569952,5,B000FKO3HG,"I constantly buy DVDs of TV series, as I am an American who has worked overseas almost continuously since 1982. Nearly every purchase has been given away. My Remington Steele DVDS will be with me forever!

Wow, have I enjoyed myself in watching all 90+ episodes of the entire series! Regardless of the DVD covers and the popularity of Pierce Brosnan, the show revolves around Laura Holt played by Stephanie Zimbalist. Laura Holt is a great female TV character! Laura is super intelligent, as brave as any male detective seen on TV, physically gifted, and feminine when called for. Laura Holt was a great model of a woman in a man's world of the 80s - today's viewers can quickly identify the obstacles put in the her path as a woman in a non-traditional career. Laura overcomes every hurdle, and it's perfectly clear to every viewer that she is the reason that the Remington Steele agency is described dozens of times as a famous, super-successful detective agency. And through the episodes she is nearly always the only real detective, asking great questions, logically placing the case info together, and 4 times out of 5 identifies the culprit first. The only real difficulty I have in her character is from the writers' having Remington Steele act chauvinistic too often and her lack of a verbal response. I guess that I am sensitive in this area due to my wife's experience in the 80s as she experienced many of the same career difficulties. During my watching of the entire collection of episodes, I became deeply committed to the idea that the Laura character be treated with respect!  That may sound strange but Laura is a WONDERFUL PERSON, who became attracted to a handsome, charming con man.

Season Five and Laura:
 I cannot believe the callousness of the writers in season five. I found it painful how they jerked the Laura character around. The values you saw in her character for four seasons were suddenly throw away; she was now uncertain, indecisive and full of doubt; she was shown as moody; and worst of all was slighted (even insulted) constantly by Remington.  Luckily this season lasts only six episodes! What a sad mess - there are a few great scenes in this season  but they are mixed into a pathetic story line. The MAGIC LAST MINUTE: Laura and Remington almost always seem indifferent towards each other (not a couple at all) UNTIL the MAGIC LAST MINUTE of the episode when they suddenly act as a caring couple. Until the very last scene of the last episode, I was fearful that the writers would have Laura having wasted five years caring about Remington (It was that bad.). However the writers sobered up, this very last scene is a great ending to the series. The affection they show in this last scene should have been obvious through all the entire last season! Despite these below average episodes in season five, I still rated the entire series as FIVE STARS -- There are 90 other episodes that are too good to ignore.

As a light-hearted detective series, it has dozens of episodes that I have re-watched. The episode styles vary, some go as far as pure drama and some as far as pure farce. My favorite is a slapstick style comedy episode ""Steele in the Chips"" (written by Zimbalist). Carrying on for five seasons a romance between Laura and Remington was extraordinarily difficult task for the writers without a doubt. I would have understood if Laura and Remington had been allowed to marry after three. The sexual tension in their relationship had to be lowered constantly to extend the romance (I guess married people were judged to have lost their romantic urge?). The writers really do however keep you concerned about the relationship between Laura and Remington ; (Spoiler) they never marry plus they do make love until the end of the fifth year! Try that today, where sex is now endemically casual. The only sad part of their romantic development is the lack of romantic nuances from Remington (touches, hugs, soft words, etc.) until midway through the third year and the only time in the entire five seasons where Remington states that he loves Laura is during a physical beating where he hallucinates that it is Laura who is beating him and says ""I love you"" to her image. As I type this, I am reminded of the English play --  ""Please no sex, we're British!"".

Stephanie Zimbalist made me care about Laura!  I found myself wanting Laura to be happy, and safe when danger was present. I attribute this to the success of Stephanie Zimbalist's portrayal of Laura.  Stephanie was extraordinary in the physical ""stunts"", in fact she often was a stunt woman. I watched her in one amazing scene three times: It had her jump to grab a fire escape ladder, swing a leg onto the lowest rung, pull herself up onto the ladder, and climb two steps at a time = all in heels. My second viewing of the scene was to ensure it was Stephanie and the third viewing was to admire her ability. When asked Stephanie could do comedy as well as Pierce Brosnan (Steele) and Doris Roberts (Mildred Krebbs). Her voice inflections were outstanding - soft when needed, harsh when needed - what a wonderful voice in the series (she does several interviews found on the DVDs and there is a clear difference that can be heard, in the series where her voice is almost lyrical at times). There is one BUT about Stephanie's performances, when the scripts were weak the cast often exaggerated word pronunciations in a campy way. In 90+ episodes they all cannot be great, no TV series can say that, not even  I Love Lucy. I admire Stephanie's work and am thankful she was cast as Laura.

Pierce Brosnan in an interview included on the DVDS mentions how he modeled his work on Cary Grant. In comparing the two - Pierce in physical comedy was superior (I still laugh as I visualize a scene where he steps into a box with his left foot as he rushes to help a woman and kicks it away - great acting). Pierce is excellent in stating short comedy quips with wonderful facial expressions. Looking at his full body of work as an actor (movies and TV), his best acting was as Remington in year three and year four. Pierce is no where near Cary when romance is the topic - too bad since Remington Steele is primarily a romantic comedy wrapped in a detective format. Frantic comedy (Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing Up Baby for Grant) is a tie - they are both wonderful. Pierce has difficulty in matching Grant in voice inflections in quieter, dramatic dialog. Brosnan's ""God given voice"" is no match for Cary's. For a romantic comedy TV series in the 80s, he is perfectly cast - handsome, gifted in short bursts of comedy, and physically tall and slender. Despite any negatives I mentioned above, he was excellent as Remington Steele. I only wish that his Remington had been given far more romantic gestures to display his commitment to Laura. Yeah I realize that for five seasons no other women were in his life, thats commitment, but I would have preferred words spoken! I am sure Pierce would have sold the audience that he was a changed man and committed to Laura, no longer the con man she first met.

Doris Roberts, who played Mildred Krebbs, was a WOW in every episode she appears! I bet that her character extended the popularity of the series into lasting at least one extra season. I could say WOW a dozen more times about her acting, she was that good.  She put everything into her lines! When she was motherly - she was perfect. When she was stern, she was perfect. When she was asked to be nervous - she as perfect. This is becoming repetitive, continuing adds nothing.

Gone after the first season were two characters, who did excellent work (receptionist and another detective). Both were effective in their acting and fit wonderfully in the story lines. As a wish I would liked Murphy, the male detective, to have hanged around to start season two and fade away during the year, as he was the rational counter balance to Laura's infatuation with Remington.

Bottom Line: I will enjoy watching episodes for decades more. The series is two decades old now and is GREAT to watch. It will be GREAT to watch after two decades. I have no doubt about that statement!",1302912000,6,8170,4.6429065743944635
2569953,5,B000FKO3HG,"As with Season 3, ""Remington Steele's"" fourth season continued delivering quality episodes. Every level of production--acting, writing, directing--maintained the excellence the show (particularly its producer, Michael Gleason) strove so hard for from day one. Pierce Brosnan continued showing his flair as an actor/leading man by walking the fine line between suave mystery man/pompous boss; Stephanie Zimbalist continued showing her resiliency/unwavering skill as a savvy/level-headed role model who, comically, often had her dignity soiled (in more ways than one: witness how she looked by the end of ""Bonds of Steele""); and Doris Roberts dug for more footing as the secretary who knew she was a valuable asset & strove for more equality with her peers.
The episodes never disappoint as the show takes its deft blend of mystery, action and screwball comedy to the max. Picking up from last season's cliffhanging ""Steele of Approval"" (in which the agency's future was hanging by a thread), Laura & Mildred go to London to track down the MIA Steele in the two-part ""Steele Searching"". To their surprise, Mr. Steele has been mistaken by Scotland Yard to be a modern-day Jack the Ripper (a story element frightenly well done); Steele gets tangled up with assassins (with the ""help"" of his friend Daniel Chalmers); and Mildred gets the biggest surprise when Laura tells her the truth: Steele doesn't exist; the man she's been idolizing is a fraud. Other notable episodes: ""Forged Steele"", in which Steele gambles away the agency, but can't remember anything the morning after; ""Corn Fed Steele"" pays homage to Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest""; ""Dancer, Prancer, Donner and Steele"" has the gang surviving a harrowing hostage situation at the hands of three ""Santas""; that episode's follow-up, ""Santa Claus is Coming to Steele""; ""Suburban Steele"" introduces us to Laura's flaky sister, with Laura & Steele's disastrously funny encounter with domesticated life; ""Sensitive Steele"" helped peel away the psychological layers of Laura & Steele's relationship; and ""Beg, Borrow or Steele"" had Laura & Steele returning from a New York trip...and discovering they had been murdered!
Again, an impressive list of guest stars for Season 4: Brosnan's wife Cassandra Harris, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. (reprising Chalmers), Terry O'Quinn (way before ""Lost""), Jere Burns, Vincent Schiavelli, comic Louie Anderson, Jennifer Tilly, Michael Constantine (reprising small-time businessman George E. Mulch), Rebecca Holden (from ""Knight Rider""), and the great Rose Marie.
But the show had peaked in popularity, and dwindling viewership cancelled the series...almost. A deluge of fan mail (and rumors of Brosnan playing James Bond) changed the network's mind, and so came Season 5...sort of. Some fans regard this season as the worst of ""Remington Steele""---kind of a throwaway season of nothing more than a string of RS movies. Well, they're right, but at least there WAS a Season 5. ""The Steele That Wouldn't Die"" was more of a T.V. movie version of ""Romancing the Stone"", and probably the weakest of the series. Picking up where ""Bonds of Steele"" left off, as Steele & Laura tried to prove to U.S. Immigration--and constantly pesky insurance investigator Norman Keyes, who was determined to expose Steele as a fraud & illegal immigrant--they were the real deal by whisking away to Mexico for a joke of a honeymoon. The series improved with the next one (""Steele Hanging in There"") as Steele's past (in the guise of an old flame, played by ""Superman II's"" Sarah Douglas) came back to haunt him, disrupting (once again) Laura & Steele's honeymoon bliss. The final one (""Steeled With A Kiss"") finally put all the pieces of Steele's puzzled past in place as it tied up loose ends. Chalmers returned with a startling revelation, Steele inherited a castle, and the series' couple--at last!--got both their privacy and happily-ever-after. The weak link to all this was the handsomely deceptive Tony Roselli (Jack Scalia), who was there as a ""romantic triangle"" device...I found him often annoying!
Some nifty featurettes are included. Farewell, Mr. Steele!",1297814400,4,4122,5.32361963190184
2569954,4,B000FKO3HG,"This review is only about the quality of the DVD digital image transfer.  All episodes, except for the last one on the Season 5 disc, were clearly made from the original films reels, instead of the syndication video tapes, and for a show from the low resolution VHS/Betamax era (does not even have a stereo sound track), it's a beautiful transfer, even in SD DVD.  I don't think they could improve on it if they were to make a Blu-Ray HD transfer, given the period's film quality that was meant to look only as good as the period TV/video tape systems could muster over the air.

Now, about that last episode on the Season 5 disc:  What the heck happened to you Fox/Deluxe guys?  Couldn't you find the original reels and had to make do with the unsold VHS release tapes that were lying around?  From the last scene take of the next-to-last episode (were you see [spoiler alert!] a confused Laura after Daniel tells her that Remington Steele, or Harry as he calls him, is his son), you can clearly see a switch in the quality of the transfer, but for the worse!.  It's as if my Blu-Ray player (best way to wring out the best picture out of the DVD disc) suddenly goes and impersonates a VHS player.  I bought all season's discs together but played the last season's disc first as I missed the entire season when it was on TV.  After seeing this image quality switcheroo, I thought that all other discs will be similar; that not all episodes would be transfers from the original film reels but rather some would be from the syndication video tapes.  Thankfully, after watching all discs, I am happy to say that all the other episodes are film transfers, making this small slip quite unforgivable, at least for me: at first it feels like this was an afterthought, but then the cynical in me thinks that it's as if Fox wanted to leave something for a future Blu-Ray release (which I don't think will be an economically sound enterprise), making this last episode an awful swan song for the show, when it should have ended with a bang, at least on the DVDs I bought.",1297123200,3,2061,4.472

But if you are a fan, you will need to buy all five seasons. It is a shame they canceled the show as the interplay between all three actors was really working for three seasons. Maybe they will do like they did with another hit series, Man from U.N.C.L.E., and produce a ""Return of Remington Steel"" to at least put an proper ending to what could have been aa wonderful 5th season instead of leaving it undone.

I got the DVD set in the mail and preceded to watch Season 5 first to ""pull the band-aid off"" if you will and see just how bad it was.  I have to say that to ME I saw NO difference at all.  I thought I was still watching the same show....to me Laura didn't act any differently then she had the other 4 seasons prior to season 5.  Everything still seemed the same to me.  I even liked Tony (Jack Scallia) cause he reminded me of Murphy.  Murphy was always in the way as well so I didn't think Tony was any different....throw in Fox and you'd have the gang back.
I liked the way it ended and am NOW looking forward to going back and watching season 4 to see how it all lead up to the end.

So to anyone wavering on this set cause of Season 5 DON'T worry.  It is still the same Steele.  I think they ended it the way it should have ended.  However, I think they should have had them together way before the very end and given us fans a little more romance in the bedroom.  I'm not disappointed though.",1195516800,5,1135,4.0

As before, we watched the additional ""making of"" type spot, which in this case highlighted the guest stars they had on each episode. Again they interspersed commentary with clips from the show.... To my shock and dismay, they also played the clip revealing who Steele's father was! I had no chance to mute it for my husband's sake. Within moments one of the two most important plot points had been summarily revealed before we could even put the last disk in the machine. Talk about disapointment.

I hadn't heard great things about the fifth season, however, so I was apprehensive as I watched it.  First, let me say that up until the end of the second to last episode of season four, it was the same old Remington Steele that I know and love.  The last episode of season four, where Remington is ""forced"" to marry a prostitute to keep himself from being deported was pretty ridiculous and unrealistic.  I watched the first three hours of season five, and was so disgusted with it that I didn't watch the rest.  The characters change quite a bit during season five, and I thought that many of the things that they did were not consistent with their characters' behavior during the previous four seasons.  I did end up watching the last three hours, though, and my attitude toward season five improved somewhat, and I think I can say that I am satisfied with the way that the series ended.
