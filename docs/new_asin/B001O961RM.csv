Mr. McMullan, Mr. Jeans, and Mr. Orenstein have really made a great film here.  I don't know about the rest of you, but usually these fly fishing films are pretty low-end fare.  I'll check them out to see if there is anything worth gleaning from them, but don't really watch them just for the sake of watching.  I threw this on and expected more of the same.  What I got instead was something between a photo/video exhibition of some of the most beautiful country in the country, a clear education in fishing the Golden Trout Wilderness, and a kicka** bluegrass concert.  It's not really a beginners film - unless you are psyching yourself out to get going - but I can easily say that if you are looking for a fly fishing vid, this is as good a place as any to start.  And maybe the best.

My only complaint would be that it is a bit long, but really, if you think about it, that just means you have more to watch.",1234051200,,1074,4.230392156862745

Maybe this time with all this much to lose and all this much to gain:  the Pulitzer, the National Book Award, the golden accolade of Stockholm itself to crown the desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble, the cast made thirty years ago; or to anyone who has ever flown a Sopwith Camel in the skies of war-torn France, the moment in 1918 when somebody thought This is it: the absolute edge of no return, to turn back now and make home or fly irrevocably, outmatched and alone, toward the enemy squadron and either attain immortality or spiral downward in flames.
(with apologies to Mr. Faulkner & ""Intruder in the Dust"" from whence this is paraphrased)

The Maxwell's play and the dvd are highly recommended.",1440720000,,1766,4.515625
8329976,5,B001O961RM,"My name is Tysun McMullan.  I and the Director of ""Sierra Fly Fishing Vol. 2""  Somehow Amazon has mixed up the titles of my DVD.  If you look at the reviews of this title they are all about the real ""SierraFly Fishing Vol. 2"" DVD

I have been trying to resolve this issue for over 8 months now and amazon can not seem to fix it.  Its pretty hard when you can not speak with a HUMAN BEING!!!!  Until they fix this mix up do not buy this DVD you will get another DVD instead.

Thank You.

8329977,1,B001O961RM,"I have ordered this video (Sierra Fly Fishing, Vol. 2) twice now from different sellers. Both times I was sent ""Oh, Mr. Fawlkner, Do You Write?"" There must be some sort of UPC error or something that is causing this mixup.",1337731200,,222,4.439024390243903
8329978,5,B001O961RM,"This is an inspiring piece of work.  Have you always wanted to read Faulkner but were afraid to try?  This piece is a wonderful first step to understanding and appreciating the work of one of the most successful, celebrated writers of our time.  John Maxwell is positively brilliant in this DVD and anyone who loves literature will love seeing this writer behind the scenes.  Don't miss the Q&A session included in the deal.",1322870400,,424,4.767123287671233
8329979,5,B001O961RM,"I am always a little skeptical of fishing videos. Usually they tend to focus on guys reeling in fish after fish. As a fish biologist I enjoy seeing the fish and their habitat along with people catching fish. The video work in this was very good, even if a little overexposed in sections. They showed the flies they were fishing very clearly and even had a section showing how to tie (presumably)their own developed fly. They included some fish break-offs and missed hooksets, which makes it feel more like a day I would have on the water. They even went into different casting techniques albeit they did not go into instruction of those techniques. I am assuming, since they lead fishing charters, if you wanted to learn spots or specific techniques you could hire them out for a trip on the upper Kern River.
All in all this is a favorable purchase, and I will recommend it to friends who enjoy flyfishing, or even just seeing mountain streams.",1300752000,,945,4.630952380952381
8329980,1,B001O961RM,"I would not recommend the video if you are looking for tips, techniques, and stategies.",1279584000,,87,4.866666666666666
8329981,5,B001O961RM,"This is the best fishing DVD I have ever watched. I have watched it over 15 times and learn somthing new every time.  Guy Jeans is a Great fisherman and a super nice person, I would highly recomend this DVD.",1260748800,,207,4.175
8329982,5,B001O961RM,"Sierra Fly Fishing Vol. 2/The Golden Trout Wilderness is an opportunity to lose yourself in some pretty incredible visuals and music that will have you playing the DVD in the background just to hear it again.  Volume 2 takes us on a journey deep into the Golden Trout Wilderness to fish for the Kern River Rainbow with Kerville, CA Fly Fishing Guide, Guy Jeans.  We pack in with mules and set up camp deep in the wilderness with gin clear water, belly deep grass for the mules and fish that most of us only dream about.

This DVD is a combination travelogue...wild trout fishing instruction and visuals that will take your breath away.  Guy gives us just enough instruction and then we just get to watch flat out fishing.  Tysun McMullen's camera work is subtle and puts us right into the action.

I give this DVD 5 stars....not because I have met Mr. Jeans and McMullen but because it is a great way to spend 90 minutes.  Look for the first in this series, Sierra Fly Fishing volume 1.  I highly recommend them both!",1240704000,2,1017,4.489130434782608
8329983,5,B001O961RM,"Like going to a movie after first reading the book, the movie usually disappoints.  For me at least, the movie lives up to expectations.  And so you know, my expectations were not developed from any book on the Upper Kern River.  I had the good fortune to experience the Golden Trout Wilderness with Guy Jean in 2006.  As I sat and watched the DVD, with the memories of this wilderness and one-of-a-kind fishery firmly etched in memory, I couldn't help but feel I was re-living the entire five days from that summer.  (My mental camera only slightly better than the digital one.)

What makes this destination DVD stand out from the rest you ask?  Let's start with the cinematography.  In a nutshell, it's clearly the work of a pro.  All the scenes from start to finish are visually rich and interesting.  The scenes essentially cover the trip starting from leaving the pack-station with the mule-train to working each of the varied fishing conditions on the upper Kern. I especially liked the way each scene transitioned with rotating shots of the two or three flies used.  (Hint: you'll see Stimulators and Kern Emergers thoughout the show.)

Next, they blended the ideal amount of information and instruction without distracting you from the amazing visuals of Guy casting dries to wild, native rainbows.  The upper Kern River really lends itself well to being captured on video.  The stretches Guy fishes are 100% gin-clear.  Most (if not all) the scenes, the camera renders the Kern River rainbows from above water.  You get a nice look into their movements and to some extent their feeding patterns before Guy drifts a juicy, articifical over their head.  As these wild fish are opportunistic feeders, it doesn't take more than one or two well-executed drifts to see them go ballistic.

Guy is the ideal host.  Having fished with Guy Jean on many of the same runs depicted in this DVD, I felt like it was just business-as-usual. Guy takes a simple, no-nonsense approach to each situation.  You get exactly the info you need to be successful without over talking it or over complicating it.  Guy stalks these trout and knows their hang-outs like the upper Kern were his home water.  And if you decide to take the punge and pack into the Golden Trout Wilderness, within a couple of days the Kern and it's rainbows will feel like a special-home.",1236124800,,2985,4.834319526627219
8329984,5,B001O961RM,"This DVD is an excellent follow up to the fist Sierra fly fishing experience.

Gorgeous cinematography, stunning scenery, well-paced scenes. After multiple views there is always some new glean of information that comes through. With techniques that can be crossed over to any river, Guy Jeans is an adept and charming host whose passion for his craft is abundantly clear. He has a obvious respect for the fish he does (and sometimes doesn't) catch.

Vol. 2 also goes in depth with the evolution and survival of the legendary Golden Trout as well as footage of the packers who brought the team into the Golden Trout Wilderness.

The original soundtrack by Gregg Orenstein is impeccable and rousing to listen to, a perfect accompaniment to filmmaker Tysun McMullan's languid shots and perfect light. One of the special features allows the viewer to listen to the soundtrack in its entirety which I have been doing since it arrived at my doorstep.",1234137600,,944,4.962025316455696
