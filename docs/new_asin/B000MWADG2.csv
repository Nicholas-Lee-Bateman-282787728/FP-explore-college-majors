8173224,5,B000MWADG2,"Totally fascinating and troubling documentary. Man has not changed in any
significant way in 5000 years. Why was this agonizing death perpetrated on this person. Maybe a disagreement over hunting grounds. Or did they just hate
each other? I got a kick out of watching the scientist shoot the hunting bow and
looking pretty proficient at it. The Alps as a backdrop for this little drama. Grim
death along with such beauty . NW",1397260800,,425,4.756756756756757
8173225,5,B000MWADG2,"Ever since Otzi was discovered in the Italian Alps in 1991, I have been fascinated with the lonely death of this 5,000-year-old human.  While I found the breathless ""whodunnit"" tone of the narration a tad irritating, the content was entirely worthwhile.  It is amazing how much has been learned from the remaining physical evidence.  For instance, experimental anthropology, in which an arrow is shot into a side of pork covered with a hide to simulate Otzi's body, is used to learn from how far away he was shot.  Modern forensic pathology and DNA analysis speak volumes about his cause of death and the involvement of other individuals.  Traditional archaeology methods shed much light on the significance of the artifacts that were discovered on and around his person.  The show does not mention his tattoos, which I had been curious about, but it does cover much ground not explored in previous articles and programs I had seen.  While we do learn a great deal about the cause and likely circumstances of Otzi's death, the show raises as many questions as it answers, and Otzi continues for me to be an endlessly intriguing link to our past.",1209081600,2,1145,4.841025641025641
8173226,3,B000MWADG2,"This work starts with the hypothesis, ""Was 5,000 year-old Otzi killed by another?""  Thus, the title is deceptive.  Instead of being ""Hunt for a Killer,"" it would have been more appropriately called ""Details from a Victim.""  The work does say Otzi may have killed animals and people in his life.  Still, I think the active, scary title is meant to grab viewers' attention more than a tragic or passive title.

Usually I hate cheesy reenactments.  However, this work would have been boring if it were entirely made of the ice and rocks in the Alps.  There are only two actors and they don't look like the modern people you'd see on ""reality"" TV.  Plus, reenactments can be so darn anachronistic.  (I've seen westerns meant to be from the 1800s where the women are dressed like Beyonc'e Knowles!)  The reenactments weren't irritating.

The work had many different professionals here:  scientists, historians, even archers.  Though this is about science, it reminded me of algebra.  Basically the narrators consistently states, ""We know X and Y, so let's do something to find out Z.""  Also, this is a true crime story.  People who are indifferent to history might still enjoy this case of Whodunnit.

I remember when Otzi was found that there was a big fight about whether Austrians or Italians owned him.  This documentary stated that Otzi must have come from south of the Alps and thus Italy.  They show Austrian and Italian experts and they don't fight over whose ancestor this is.  Still, it was amusing seeing people who learned German first pronouncing the English ""the"" as if it sounded like the German ""der.""

The work starts by saying, ""Otzi has been examined hundreds of times, but we now know that he had stab wounds on his body.""  Why wasn't that learned then!?  Did people purposely want to think that an ancient man couldn't die violently?  Did people want this ancient corpse not to be that of a victim?  I remember clearly when Otzi was found that journalists kept writing ""Did he have a wife and kids?"" and activists kept responding, ""How do we know that he wasn't celibate, polygamous, or had a male lover?""  I wasn't planning on referencing Michel Foucault and discourse, but do modern hopes and expectations paint how we see this ancient man?",1198281600,2,2258,4.8
