8583549,5,B00CMQAKVY,"Alan Davies has managed to prove himself as one of those rare multi-talented actors who are able to pull off an iconic character like Jonathon Creek without becoming typecast by him.  Davies states he's a comedian first and this DVD is proof.  Davies stand up routines are seamless.  As if it's just you and him having a laugh over a drink.  His execution is flawless and his topics are identifiable, which is what comedy is about.  If the audience can't relate to a situation, then it isn't funny.  When Davies opens up a bit into his ""pain"" (death of his mother, grandfather's lapse into Alzheimer's) he crafts his stories in a manner that one can laugh at and sympathize with at the same time.  This DVD will leave you with a sense of entertainment and just a bit of reflection into your own situations.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",1426636800,,843,4.573333333333333
8583550,5,B00CMQAKVY,"A must-have for Alan Davies fans. Not for the squeamish as far as colourful language, but this is common in today's stand-up.
Funny, entertaining, and a little peek into Alan's home life. And it's a very recent show!",1419120000,2,216,4.7105263157894735
