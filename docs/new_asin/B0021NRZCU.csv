8349314,5,B0021NRZCU,"This series Vol. 1 and Vol 2 seems to be out of print. Sometimes Amazon.co.uk has it and the sellers are willing to ship internationally.  I begged sellers on ebay Australia to ship to me, and succeeded. There is a also a movie, which is good. HOWEVER, the series is infinitely better. Mille Dinesen is wonderful. If you've gone on a Nordic Noir binge you'll recognize lots of other actors. This really is an ensemble piece, and the relationship between Nynne and her female friends is great fun.  Well written and with all that highly addictive bicycle riding again. If you love Rita you might love Nynne even more.",1435708800,2,616,4.6422018348623855
