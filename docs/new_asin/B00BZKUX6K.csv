8575858,4,B00BZKUX6K,"This is another independent film with a modest budget, written and directed by an American Jewish director, Jeff Lieberman.  The Igbo are a large tribal group in Nigeria (the largest and possibly wealthiest nation in sub-Saharan Africa).  Most of them are Christian, but some tens of thousands of them are convinced they are actually descended from Jews who fled south and west during one of the diaspora, and as of 2012 when the film was made there were about 28 synagogues scattered about the country, all in areas of Igbo population.

As many of you know, Nigeria is an increasingly troubled country.  Always problematic has been the split between Christians and Muslims (with the survival of native religious traditions as well).  Nigeria is rich in oil, and as in many other oil-producing countries, the oil has done more to line the pockets of politicians and foreign corporations and very little to improve the lot of most of the population.  For years there have been attacks on oil pipes and production facilities, and more recently the growth of the radical Islamic terrorist group, Boko Haram.  Amidst all of that, the film concentrates solely on Igbo communities, and mostly on the Igbo who are practicing Judaism.

The director presents a variety of reasons why there may be some truth to this: similarities between Igbo words and old Hebrew words; close similarities of some traditions, such as circumcision and Sabbath, etc.  The State of Israel has not acknowledged the Igbo, even those practicing Judaism, as Jewish or having a right to immigrate, but perhaps that is due to the indigestion it is still getting over after absorbing the last African immigrant population.  He says the Igbo resist DNA testing which might help to prove or disprove whether they are genetically related to middle-eastern Jews, but interestingly many Igbo were also brought to the US as slaves (at least 50,000) and the film states the only other new-world country which may have more blacks of Igbo descent than the Carolinas is Jamaica (also a frequent stop on slave ship routes).

The Igbo who have adopted Judaism of course have done it in their own way: they set the prayers and writings to song and sing them communally, with beautiful voices.  The colors of their clothes are vivid and beautiful.  The general tone of the documentary is upbeat; remarkably so considering the problems that exist in Nigeria as a whole.  I definitely enjoyed watching it, and give it a B+.  It lists 6 awards on its front jacket.",1417219200,2,2513,4.907801418439717

8575861,4,B00BZKUX6K,"Not only for people of African descent who live in the Americas, but for the entire African diaspora this film is another piece to the puzzle for those who live without any connection to who they really are. I only gave it 4 stars because if know history, you will know that black people in this film aren't ""Jews"" but are of Judah. They are Hebrew Israelites and not Jews, with that aside, this film deserves to be watched by all. It is another piece to the puzzle in deciphering the true identities of the so called african american. I commend this film maker for making this movie. The awakening has begun.",1397433600,2,609,4.446428571428571
8575862,5,B00BZKUX6K,"I saw this documentary in my synagogue last week.  It was so moving to see these people practice what I have practiced all my life.
As a Jew I have always wondered what happened to the 10 lost tribes that G-d dispersed from his land of Israel. to save them.  Had he not Hitler and other Hitlers would have obliterated the Jewish people.
This documentary shows us what happened to the tribe of Gad.  Where they went after they left the land of Israel.  Just as we have the written Torah and the oral history handed down generation to generation, the Igbo have passed down their history and practice of Judaism the same way. Their traditions are the same as ours and their prayers are the same.  Who are we to day that they are not Jews. In historical times the male, not the female passed down what we determined to be our right to be called Jews. Having not  lived in a part of the world where Judaism flourished and where we thrived  and perished as Sphardim and Ashkinazi Jews, does not mean the Jews of Nigeria are not Jews. That they are now trying to reclaim their heritage should be lauded.
Watch this DVD and judge for yourself.  This was written by David's wife, Eudice",1384732800,5,1177,4.391705069124424
