6509565,4,B00LXGIK5M,"All right, so after a couple years, Funimation decided to get around to licensing this anime, and boy am I glad that they did.

For those of you that don't know, this is the first part of the second season of A Certain Magical Index, which follows our protagonist Kamijou Touma as he works to protect index from the evil factions who just want her for her brain. If you're here, then you probably know all of this, I mean it's in the description after all...

Anyway, what you probably want to know consists of the questions ""Is this worth watching"" and ""Do I really want to drop nearly forty bucks on this?""

Honestly, for only the first half at least, I would say probably not at the price they are asking. This isn't to say that the series is bad, far from it, it's just that it isn't nearly as good as the second half and so, at least to me, doesn't justify its current and fairly steep asking price. I understand that this is subjective and a matter of personal preference, so I'll get off my soapbox now.

As for the episodes themselves, they are much stronger than those in the early part of the first season. Instead of a mish-mash of somewhat related arcs, we get a real story that is obviously heading somewhere (where that is, I will leave you to find out but suffice to say that it is completely worth it.) I would recommend watching it, but only so that you can continue on to the second half, which is where the series shines. Please note that there is a fair amount of fan service in this first half, and that I am not a huge fan service which I feel detracts from an anime when it has more going for it than just boobs; which index most definitely does.

Also, if you have seen Railgun S, the last arc of Index II part II is as good or better than that.

6509566,4,B00LXGIK5M,Season 2 has a lot more action and punching people in the face for my tastes. If you want a hero who believes enough in Justice that he doesn't care about gender or age and will punch them into changing their ways then this is the show for you.,1417392000,5,244,4.0
