Not only is the music marvelous, but the writting, acting, and costumes are sublime.

709690,5,6303637493,"Set in 18th Century Europe, this is the story of castrato Carlo Broschi (known as ""Farinelli""), arguably the greatest (at least the most popular) singer of all time.  The film delves into his life in a deeply personal, if fictionalized, way.  Reminiscent of ""Amadeus"" in its mixture of truth and fiction, we follow the lives of Farinelli and his brother, the composer Ricardo Broschi, from street trumpet duels through stardom, and Farinelli's life as a court figure and personal singer to King Phillip V of Spain.
Farinelli struggles with fractured memories and painful questions as he learns to use his talent apart from his brother's composing.  No, no, that's too flat a description of the story -- after watching this film MANY times, I must say that each time I see it, I find new sub-plots and new techniques applied in direction, cinematography and music.
The film features lush cinematography and a unique and rich soundtrack (featuring the computer-b! ! lended voices of Derek Lee Ragin, Counter-tenor, and Ewa Mallas-Godlewska, soprano, to simulate the vocal range of Farinelli).
I could not give a higher recommendation to this film, which I *believe* won a Golden Globe for best foreign language film, and was nominated for an Oscar in the same category.
CORRECTIONS:  Stefano Dionisi is the star, not the Director or Producer (the listing should read, ""by Gerard Corbiau"").  Also, the name of the film is ""Farinelli, Il Castrato""  END",900374400,11,1448,5.03765690376569

709896,5,6303637493,"This movie was produced in Belgium in the mid-1990's.  It received a Golden Globe Best Foreign Movie Award in 1994.
I watched this in a laser dic, not DVD. The sound (by Sony) is gorgeous.  The original soundtrack was conducted and produced by French baroque expert conductor Christophe Roussett early in his musical career (he was a young man then).
Roussett worked to obtain the 'sound' of the castrato Farinelli by amalgamating two voices - the alto voice (of American countertenor) and a soprano voice (female Czech soprano).  Back in the 1990's the baroque revival in Europe was just gaining momentum, and this movie really set the ball rolling at great speed. Nowadays after two decades, a single countertenor would be able to handle the vocal demands for Farinelli.
So much for the music.
This movie is highly watchable, even if you are not musical expert.  It has all the ingredients of a great soap opera, so do not feel shy to enter.
The two Broschi brothers are wonderfully portrayed.  Stefano Dionisi subsequently also portrayed Antonio Vivaldi in another classical music movie.
The cosutme and scenariy are all great.",1420675200,2,1130,4.957671957671957

The Broschi brothers are perfectly cast, as is everyone else in this film. I don't know how true to life the story is as presented in the movie, but it matters not.  The entirety of the film, from the acting and cinematography, to costumes and musical selections, is perfection. And I always appreciate when actors actually speak in their native languages, and when foreigners speaking a foreign language actually speak with a foreign accent.  That always adds so much authenticity to the film. Men, beware. The movie opens with a castration scene.  Be sure you are man enough to handle it!",1418947200,5,757,4.611940298507463

709901,4,6303637493,"Farinelli gives some insight into the milieu of the castrati in the 18th century.  But it's primarily a story about those on the fringes of society, the juxtaposition of physical deformity and crippled emotions, and how people love (or avoid love).  The music (mostly Handel) is great.  And Jeroen Krabbe, as Handel, is one of the movie's best performances.  At times I feel it tips over the edge into excess, and not the productive excess necessary for the portrayal of a decadent culture.  It's just... too much sometimes.  But how can you not love a movie that has dialog in four different languages (French, Italian, English, German).  It demands that the viewer be educated and cultured, and that's not a bad thing.",1413417600,3,720,4.852459016393443

710050,5,6303637493,"Although highly inaccurate in the portrayal of the world's most famous castrato, Farinelli is a good introduction to the magical world of Baroque Opera and a visually beautiful film with great costumes and sets.

The sets and costumes of the actual representations are great, in good form to the period and one wishes they could have been longer and shown more of the opera productions. The music is absolutely superb and I recommend getting the CD to hear the complete arias. There are plenty of extremely talented countertenors now reviving the part of the castratos all over the world: David Daniels, Dominique Vise and Andreas Scholl to name just a few that come to mind. Derek Lee Ragin was also excellent so I really do not see the need for the voice mix with a soprano, the ONLY choice for a mix, if any,  should have been Ewa Podles, a great alto singer that is also a great baroque technician.

The whole plot around Farinelli and Handel is silly. The opera he ""steals"" from him was a very early opera of Handel,(Rinaldo)  which was published by then and he could have bought it at the local music shop. Still, it is interesting from ""the what if"" point of view. Handel was and remains, one of the world's greatest and most talented composers. His operas are particularly beautiful and they have been coming back to the repertory since the 1920's but much more strongly in the past 20 years. ""Xerxes"" ""Agripina"", ""Semele"", ""Flavio"", ""Alcina"". ""Partenope"" and ""Orlando"" have all been revived at the NYCO in recent seasons with excellent productions and sold out houses. Even the stodgy, retrograde MET has staged his ""Rinaldo"" ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Rodelinda"". His stature as one of the finest opera composers of all time is finally been recognized and secured for future generations.

Strongly recommended for those interested in the Baroque period, particularly music.",1271808000,4,1877,4.889937106918239

I've heard a recoding of the last of the Castrati and in this film a male alto and female sporano are digitally combined to replicate the voice of the Castrati - not male and not female.  The practice barbaric and long discontinued, the legacy of the Castrati are preserved masterfully in this movie.  I watch it again and again.",1269129600,3,631,4.63963963963964
710052,5,6303637493,"This film left me cold when I first saw it; I almost think I was watching a different film. But recently I've revisited it and its excerpts on YouTube, and I have been completely captivated by the story and music. And although this ""biography"" is reportedly more fiction than fact, it is still too lush, fascinating, tragic, and beautiful to be overlooked. (Music of the Baroque Era is my favorite genre, Handel my favorite composer; I'm certainly biased in favor of both.)

Here's my suggestion: If you watch this movie, be sure to find the lyrics at least to ""Lascia ch'io pianga"" and to follow them during that sequence. Better yet, stock up with all the lyrics; they're easy to find on the Web. Just search for the arias' titles.

Here's why: For viewers like me who speak only one language, the subtitles on the DVD of this film don't include the lyrics to the music. Without the lyrics, you can't fully appreciate the richness of the story: the relationship between the brothers Carlo (the younger, stage name Farinelli) and Riccardo Broschi (the older); the tormented position of the castrato in society (loved, lauded, exploited, denied, and reviled); and of the era itself.

These conflicts are particularly revealed in the ""Lascia ch'io pianga"" sequence. In that aria, the imprisoned hero of the opera (sung by Farinelli) mourns the loss of his freedom, while the intertwined flashbacks reveal how he really became a castrato. Carlo/Farinelli has always been told his castration was the result of a tragic accident. We learn in the preceding sequence and we see in the flashbacks that Farinelli's (Carlo's) own brother had him castrated while the child Carlo was drugged, to ensure that Carlo's splendid voice would endure to grace Riccardo's own music -- music unworthy of the sacrifice. But the betrayal that stole Carlo's freedom to choose his fate preserved his art. How can Carlo reconcile himself to such betrayal and loss -- and yet gain?",1248825600,6,1955,4.918181818181818
710053,4,6303637493,"Though this is not on a par with Amadeus, it is an incredibly rich portrait of a period.  I was fascinated by it, and my daughter, a serious singing student, saw (non-racy) portions of it in her French school.  It is a very European film, paying minute attention to historical (if not biographical) detail.  It is also a taut drama between two brother, one a performer of genius (truly a rock star of his age) and the other a hanger-on who uses his brother to advance an otherwise mediocre talent.  Hamdel is also fun, but I never appreciated him all that much.

At the core of the drama is a terrible secret, of course.  The brothers are very close, sharing lovers and their music, and their love for each other is lost eventually.  While this is not biographically anything we can know, it is great drama that never becomes soap opera.

You see popular culture for aristocrats of the time, which is a real treat.  They are not portrayed as silly dilettantes (such an easy cheap shot), but as great cultural enthusiasts and patrons, which some of them were.

Recommended warmly.  It is worth re-viewing many times and we certainly will.",1243641600,7,1137,4.606965174129353
710054,5,6303637493,"Cleverly embedded within Farinelli's story is the true legacy of the Templar Knights: a secret yogic practice for self-liberation.

710169,2,6303637493,"Visually opulent, and with a stunning soundtrack, this film could have been so much better if it didn't take completely unnecessary--and foolish--liberties with the story of the real Farinelli. Unfortunately, much of the plot is just plain silly. Whether or not a castrato would have been capable of sexual relations (and it is believed that they were), it is absurd how the film proposes that Farinelli would have sex with a woman, but then had to turn her over to his uncastrated brother to finish her off, as it were. I doubt that a man's ability to ejaculate has much to do with a woman's sexual satisfaction. And the portrayal of the composer George Frideric Handel is just plain ridiculous. When I saw this film in a theater with three friends, the scene where Handel hears Farinelli sing and nearly has a heart attack, with his wig falling off, prompted all four of us to laugh out loud. (In reality, Handel didn't have as high an opinion of Farinelli's singing as some, and chose not to hire him for his own opera troupe.) The film also depicts Farinelli plotting to sing Handel's music by having a maid steal a manuscript from Handel's apartment. The result is Farinelli singing ""Lascia ch'io pianga"" from the opera Rinaldo--which makes no sense at all, since that aria was written for a woman soprano, not an alto castrato, and Farinelli didn't perform travesty roles. Besides, by the time of the incident portrayed, the score of Rinaldo had been published and Farinelli could have simply purchased a copy. The main attraction of this film is the soundtrack. We really have no idea what the castrati sounded like (yes, I know there is a recording of ""the last castrato"" made in 1902, but it's a terribly weak representation of what the great ones must have sounded like), so for the film they concocted a unique voice by digitally combining the sounds of a woman soprano and a male falsettist. The result is dazzling; my recommendation is to buy the soundtrack. The best elements of the film are the beautiful costumes and camera work. The staging of  opera scenes is beautiful enough that you wish they had included complete excerpts, instead of frustratingly brief teases; at least the musical selections are complete on the soundtrack CD.",1175126400,41,2251,4.801546391752577
710170,4,6303637493,"Thank goodness this prize-winning, one-of-a-kind film ""Farinelli"" was made, even though there are many disappointments about it.  It makes a good story about the greatest singer ever; however, the plot has little to do about the real Carlo Broschi.  Some scenes and ideas about him actually are the antithesis of the real man.  I would guess that this story is about 10% Carlo, 10% about other known castrati, 10% about castrati in general, 20% about Baroque opera and that era, and 50% just plain fiction.  As astonishing as Farinelli's voice and career were, he did not have the conflicts and drama film makers believed necessary to make a successful movie; therefore, they made it up.

My being a true music lover and also knowledgable about Baroque belle canto, I'm most disappointed in the voices used.  The Sony techs knew how to electronically meld the voices of a countertenor and a female soprano, but obviously they knew little about the belle canto sound, regardless of the fact that there were clues in their own script(!), let along first-hand accounts written by knowledgable people of that time.  Admittedly in 1994, better trained countertenors were only beginning to appear, so the established, average-voice one chosen may have seemed reasonable to the film makers.  In addition, the breathy, warbly, imprecise approach among most female sopranos (along with their distinctly female timbre) had become engrained and accepted by most listeners since the 19th century, so the makers did not sense that this soprano's voice was inappropriate in their attempt to approximate the castrato voice.  If they had been more careful in choosing, they should have insisted that supreme soprano Gundula Janowitz participate in the production.  And for the countertenor, they should have chosen Andreas Scholl.  Regardless of the fact that he was early in his countertenor carreer, he was known for that as well as his earlier experience as a boy soprano.

The other musical disappointment is, to keep the movie length shorter, the arias were truncated to 2/5 their original length or less.  This is understandable from a film-maker's view; however, the viewer misses the intent to the Da Capo aria form where the repeated musical theme provides the singer (who in a sense was a ""co-composer"") with the opportunity to ""show his stuff,"" i.e., his acrobatic vocal skills, high notes, and his musical understanding.  The CD soundtrack does have the complete arias and, therefore, is more informative and satisfying.

Since this 1994 film was made, interest among music lovers in Baroque vocal works has expanded greatly with many new productions of operas, oratorios, etc., from Handel, Hasse, Bononcini, Mozart, etc.  The Center for the Study of Farinelli has been established in Bologna.  Farinelli's remains were discovered in 2006 and are being studied.  A new production approached carefully and seriously, well researched, financed, cast, and directed, would be very welcome.",1174348800,15,2982,5.2289915966386555
710171,5,6303637493,"Lavish, lusty, imaginative, free-wheeling bio-pic about the life of opera singer Farinelli, one of the great superstars of the 18th century.  The sets and costumes are appropriately extravagant.  The Baroque aesthetic is flamboyantly genuine.  As Carlo and Riccardo Broschi, Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso are both darkly beautiful and splendidly sexy.

The Church prohibited women from singing in Rome and, in its infinite wisdom, condoned the castration of talented boys to provide treble voices for the Sistine Chapel. Families would send a musical son to a conservatory for this purpose just as they might send another to a seminary for the priesthood.  The great castrati, far from being greeted with the aversion of a modern sensibility, were venerated. Women wept, swooned, fainted at their performances, and they lived lives of great comfort.

Born Carlo Broschi, Farinelli was a musical genius with a voice of extraordinary facility, power, and beauty;  his older brother Riccardo is portrayed here as a second-rate composer whose notoriety is entirely dependent upon the genius of his younger brother.  This is just one of the historical facts that have been altered or exaggerated for the sake of dramatic effect.

Riccardo was a successful, if minor, composer.  Their brotherly disputes were the subject of much gossip, but not for the reason promulgated in the film.  Carlo took his stage name to honor a benefactor named Farina.  He was reportedly not much interested in sex, but many castrati were highly sensual as Farinelli is depicted in the film.  He never sang for Handel but the composer was a jovial man and treated musicians with respect.  The decision to portray him as an ogre is the film's greatest, and most unnecessary, distortion.

The star of the film, ultimately, is the resplendent music.  The voice of Farinelli (miraculously synthesized from a soprano and a counter-tenor) is glorious.  The performances are joyously Baroque.  And, considering the extraordinary beauty of Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso, it is a luxurious feast for eyes as well as the ears.",1173312000,19,2101,5.2023809523809526
710172,5,6303637493,"I love this film and have watched it many times. The richness of the world of 18th century music is wonderfully done, the singing is breathtakingly gorgeous, but best of all is the complex portrayal of the young castrato Farinelli (whose real name was Carlo Broschi) in all his brilliance, moodiness, exhausting and exacting art, his lovingness and artistic arrogance, wit, tenderness and deep sadness....and his amazing relationship with his brother Riccardo, a mediocre composer who has given his life in service to Carlo's gift and also taken Carlo's life by having him secretly castrated as a child so that his boyhood soprano voice might always sing Riccardo's music...something that Carlo does not know but will learn in the course of the film.

I am myself a historical novelist (MARRYING MOZART from Viking Penguin) and the question is always present for me of how far historical fact should be nudged for the sake of drama. Certainly in my studies of Mozart for my book, I thought many times of how, in the movie AMADEUS, the character of Salieri was badly maligned and worse, the character of Mozart himself was presented as a foul-mouthed child, taking a very small part of Mozart's real behavior (a handful of youthful smutty letters to a cousin) and making it the measure of the man!

So saying, I wish the writer/director of FARINELLI had not made Handel such a cruel, insensitive pig. Handel is so gratuitously insulting to the young Farinelli when they first meet, so taunting and disdainful when Farinelli is nothing but polite, that when Farinelli spits in Handel's face, the viewer wishes he'd done much more. This is no way to recruit a young genius singer to come work for you! Each time we see Handel in the movie he gets crueler until at the end he is seen having some sort of physical collapse when he hears Farinelli sing Handel's great opera ""Rinaldo"" with great beauty...and vows never to write opera again! Oh, why was the composer of ""The Messiah"" portrayed as such a horror?

Farinelli's seduction of women was also a bit overdone. However, when his brother comes in to make such seductions a mnage  trois, Stefano Dionisi's Farinelli is brilliant...he looks exhausted, bewildered, wistful, as if wondering how he ever got into such an arrangement and what he is doing there and what his place is indeed off the stage, being as he is, a man who is idolized for his singing voice and at the same time mocked for the lack of procreative powers which has made that glorious voice possible.

Yet even with these things said, I would give it six stars if I could! Oh what a portrait it is of an artist made an idol against his will and the relationship of brothers, so grievous when broken, so difficult to mend!",1170547200,17,2737,4.741596638655462

Perhaps this is why this vivid tale of the castrato and his yearning to reconnect with his humanity touches us so deeply.  And while it is true that there are fictionalised portions of this film, Gerard Corbiau has achieved a wonderful balance between the actual events and the practicalities of story-telling, to deliver a sumptuous drama imbued with all the depth and soul that such a tale demands.

The performances are quite stunning.  Criticisms of Dionisi's lip-synching have been overrated - by a criterion of how affected one's enjoyment of the film is by it, it barely rates a mention.  He really did a wonderful job, and given that we longer have access to the castrato voice in its eighteenth century prime, the technology behind creating its other-worldly quality is actually rather remarkable.

710174,5,6303637493,"EXPERT FUSING OF TWO VOICES CREATES A SEMI-CASTRATO SOUND!

This film is an excellent portrayal of the famous castrati singer 'Carlo Broschi (Farinelli), whose castration occured when he was a young child, and supposedly was his older brother Riccardo's doing; Riccardo being several years older and more or less in charge of his younger brother as both parents were dead.

It shows the method of castration often used at that time,but there were many other methods also used.  Carlo wows friends and foes alike with his larger than life stage presence and strong, beautiful singing in 18th century Europe. He sings the mediocre opera compositions of his underachieving older brother Riccardo, who rides the coattails of his more talented and popular younger brother.  Although Riccardo tries to prevent Carlo from going to London (because he knows that once Carlo hears the music of Handel, that would be the end for his mediocre efforts).  And that is exactly what happins.  Carlo begins singing Handel arias and the 2 brothers are separated for many years; Carlo actually throws Riccardo out because he finds out that Riccardo had him castrated!

The soundtrack of 'Farinelli', which features the recreation of the castrato voice using a digitally 'morphed' mixture of a counter-tenor (Derek Ragin) with a soprano voice (Ewa Godlewska), was directed by Christophe Rousset, director of Les Talens  Lyriques.  The recreation of the voice of Farinelli, with its superhuman quality was the greatest challange faced by Gerard Corbiau.

 There is really no accurate existing recording of the great castrati singers.  One cannot classify the disc of the late Alessandro Moreschi, dating from 1902 as a true picture of that glorious voice described by the listener historians of the 18th century.  Thus the fusing of 2 voices to obtain the vocal range of a castrato (three and one-half octaves).  In my opinion, the whole thing comes together very accurately and pleasantly; and has a great mixture of Handel opera arias.",1159747200,7,2016,5.163076923076923

710307,3,6303637493,"Something seems strangely amiss with what could have been a fascinating historical glimpse into the world of the castrati (castrated male opera singers) in 18th-century Europe. This 1994 Belgian film is an opulent production full of stunning costumes and set decorations, but director Gerard Corbiau is far more focused on the co-dependency between two real-life brothers, Carlo Broschi, the swoon-worthy castrato known to the world as Farinelli, and his marginally talented composer brother Riccardo. Although there are glimpses of the castration that occurred when Carlo was ten, the narrative deals very little with the psychological anguish of this act, instead showing extravagantly vainglorious scenes of Farinelli's impact on audiences at the time. It's as if the story structure of the Baroque operas written at that time took over the sensibility of the screenplay and trivialized the human complexities into exaggerated melodrama.

Despite a valiant effort by Stefano Dionisi in the title role, Farinelli is portrayed as a moody, self-centered egotist rather than a misunderstood artist. Compounding the problem is the fact that his masculine speaking voice is at odds with his ethereal singing voice (obviously a creative decision so as not to alienate the general audience from the character's plight). Moreover, the computerized melding of countertenor Derek Lee Ragin and soprano Ewa Mallas Godlewska into Farinelli's voice simply does not sync up well with Dionisi's lip and throat movements. In other words, you simply don't believe it's Dionisi's voice coming out of him. When the film finally takes flight in the last third of the film, it's because the focus has shifted to the competitive, intense relationship between Farinelli and the great composer of the age, Handel. Jeroen Krabbe - familiar to American audiences for his nasty turn as Barbra Streisand's condescending husband in ""The Prince of Tides"" - plays Handel with such passionate fury that I wish the film was more about his character. This sequence climaxes with the film's musical highlight, a trio of wonderful, truly classic arias from Handel's ""Rinaldo"" - ""Lascia ch'io pianga"", ""Cara sposa, amante cara, dove sei?"" and ""Venti, turbini, prestate le vostre ali a questo pie"".

Unfortunately, the remaining musical performances are not nearly as absorbing and rather repetitive. The film again flails toward the end when we are given a rather silly scene involving a solar eclipse and gratuitous nudity with a mnage a trois among Farinelli, Riccardo and Alexandra, the woman who is - quite literally - between them. The remaining performances are fine with Enrico LoVerso conveying his Salieri-like inferiority with appropriate fervor, Elsa Zylberstein beguiling as Alexandra and Caroline Cellier doing a fine Jeanne Moreau impersonation as the jaded Margareth Hunter. Overall it's still a relatively disappointing movie saved by Handel's musical genius. Except for a few trailers, there are no extras with the DVD. For those interested in the world of the castrati in more penetrating detail, I suggest reading Anne Rice's 1982 novel, ""Cry to Heaven"", and the ""Rinaldo"" arias are better served by countertenor David Daniels and mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli on their 2002 cast recording conducted by Christopher Hogwood.",1122422400,15,3307,5.444444444444445

This is the story about a talented child owner of a promising voice; to whom simply with the only purpose of keep this vocal coloratura much longer, is castrated. So this criminal fact, masked behind the perpetual search of the preservation of the artistic future will shock your sensibility, and will be motive of your concern through this intense drama.

710309,5,6303637493,"Admittedly, I did not know a lot about opera or Farinelli before seeing this movie, so whatever historical inaccuracies it might contain were not noticeable or distracting to me. With this disclaimer made, let me say that when the movie was over, I was immediately moved to learn more about this legendary singer and the opera he performed.

This move is gorgeously shot, beautifully acted and never slow. For those reviewers who complain that Farinelli is portrayed as being ashamed of his castration, I would argue that an early scene in the film, when Farinelli sees another castrato being made fun of in front of an audience and gets up on stage to defend him and show off his own beautiful voice, is proof that the castration itself is not a source of shame for Farinelli. He is certainly proud of his talent. I think the movie is more concerned with Farinelli's ambivalence toward his brother and his strong desire to be a father. He is not ashamed of his catsration, but rather feels pained that he cannot start a family of his own, and that he must be so dependent on his brother.

As another reviewer mentions, the real tension of the movie is between the brothers, who both help and constrain one another terribly, with Farinelli being especially held back by Riccardo.

This tension simmers throughout the movie and finally explodes in various climactic scenes. You will be enthralled to see how the relationship between these two men develops, changes and eventually disintegrates.

The actor who plays Farinelli is perfectly androgynous as a true castrato would be, and though he has some trouble with the lip-synching, he puts so much emotion into his part that it doesn't distract too much. Also, I did not find the sex scenes to be over-the-top as others have suggested. Remember, this is a European movie about a young, stirring European man, and the attitude toward sex in Europe is far less prude than ours tends to be in the U.S. This is definitely an erotic and passionate film, so be prepared for that.

This is a deep, complicated, beautiful movie about relationships, dependency, art, and music. It won the Golden Globe in '94 for best foreign film and was nominated for the Oscar in the same category. Enjoy.",1107216000,22,2233,4.774611398963731
710310,5,6303637493,"Director Gerard Corbiau's Farinelli won Best Picture of 1995. The foreign film, mixed Italian and French, retells the story of the famous and greatest castrato singer Carlo Broschi. The film is exotic, intensely emotional and loaded with beautiful music of the Baroque Era (1600-1750). With all the good things about this movie, comes some things that might be rather disturbing or inappropriate for a younger audience. This is assuredly an adult film. There are two explicit sex scenes at the beginning and end of the film. This is a movie for an adult who is interested in the period, in the life of the castrati and in opera at this time. The opening introduces Carlo Broschi as a little boy singing in the church choir. Another young lad has been castrated to preserve his voice and is so mortified he leaps to his death. Eventually Carlo's brother Riccardo is obligated to do the same to his brother. We don't learn until later in the film that it was Riccardo and not Carlos' brother that conducted the castration. Here, Farinelli is usually quite ill and is forced to take opium as medicine. Farinelli does not seem to think highly of his brother's operas, which are written exclusively for his voice. Instead, he believes the greatest composer of this time is George Frederic Handel, played convincingly by Jerome Krabbe. In a dinner party, in which the Nobles insult Handel, Farinelli is outraged and declares that Handel will long be remembered and not the Nobles and their operas. This ends up being true since Handel is considered one of the greatest composers of this period togeter with Johann Sebastian Bach.
The movie has some inaccuracies and are not historically true. Naturally, this being a costume drama, there are some elements which were entirely fictional created for the sake of sensationalism. Although it is true Riccardo Broschi did compose operas for his brother Farinelli, there is no real evidence they ""shared"" the women they bedded. In the movie, a Countess is so enamored with Farinelli that she jumps into bed with him only to discover he's castrated. Thus, Riccardo plants the seed and Farinelli only lures the women into bed and seduces them. This is fabricated material to ""sex up"" the movie. In real life, Farinelli I'm inclined to believe was chaste. He sung many times for religious services and was a devout Catholic. He may not have been at all bitter for his castration since he lived like a king all his life, surrounded in luxury. He was well acquainted with European royalty, all of Europe loved him and he died after years of singing in the chambers of King Phillip of Spain. The rivalry between the Nobles Theatre Opera and Handel's opera company is true. In fact, it remains the only true thing about this movie. The English in London disliked the German foreigner Handel and his prominence in London. He was so beloved that even King George and Queen Anne protected him. The Nobles schemed endlessly to get rid of Handel. The portrayal of Handel as a musical genius, a man of stubborn, perfectionist character is all true. I think the most moving scenes are those with Handel, such as the scene in which Farinelli is overhearing him play the organ in the church and is moved by the music and the scene of Farinelli singing ""Lascio Chio Pianga"" from Rinaldo which ultimately moves Handel to tears. All the scenes of opera and Farinelli singing in his majestic costumes in this movie are stunningly beautiful. Finally, this movie's soundtrack is incredible. It contains the combined voices of tenor Derek Rogin and soprano Ewa Mallas as the singing voice of Farinelli. The arias sung here are taken from Riccardo Broschi's operas Idaspe and Artaserse and from Handel's Julius Caesar and Rinaldo. A superb film and a must see for fans of Baroque opera.",1088640000,68,3800,4.838709677419355
710311,5,6303637493,"This DVD comes equipped with English translation from the Italian that this movie was made in. There are also subtitles in French and Spanish, as well as scene selections. French director Gerard Corbiau decided to make a lush film about the life of Farinelli, the greatest castrato singer in all history, portrayed by Italian actor Stefano Dionisi. On DVD, this film looks exquisite. It's a film of adult material (nudity and sex) and for specialized interests. Opera buffs will want to take a glimpse back to the early days of Baroque Opera when the castrati were the music idols of their day, enjoying rockstar status and great wealth. Everything about this film is really engaging to look at. The authentic historic costumes and the precise European locations provide the film with an immediacy and virtual historic escape. We are there in 17th century Italy following this dramatically heightened take on the career of Farinelli. Stefano Dionisi does a great performance, though his effiminate looks, mischief and diva temperament reveals something of a homosexual but this notion is taken into question when we see him in the love scenes with the many beautiful women that are his groupies and loyal admirers of his voice.
This drama may not be entirely true. The story of how the two brothers who are at conflict (one brother reaps the benefits the other is left frustrated and obscure) may be a deliberate attempt to resemble Milos Forman's Amadeus. Farinelli came from a family of musical ambitions and when he was about to hit puberty he wanted to be castrated for the sole purpose of making millions of money and acquiring world fame as a singer. Castrating male youth so as to keep their high-pitched soprano range was an Italian custom, which died out in the 18th century where women began to enjoy more prominet roles in opera, such as the operas of Mozart. Farinelli was the greatest castrato singer of his day. He was incredibly rich and enjoyed the company of royalty. After his many theatrical performances in operas by Handel and other composers, he gave up the stage to sing in the private chambers of Spanish King Phillip V. He lived in luxury there for the rest of his life.
The film is exotic and beautiful to look at and to listen. The music of Handel is prominent, since it was Handel who most wrote for the castrati voice. Impressive are the scenes at the opera, where Farinelli dazzles and mesmerizes his audience against the colorful and elaborate Baroque stage sets. In one scene early in the film, he sings what looks like the sun god Apollo, in a feathered helmet, and is briefly interrupted by a young lady's turning the pages to a libretto. He continues his singing and finishes with an elongated note that is impossible to hold for any tenor or soprano nowadays. Today, the castrati vocal sound is extinct. Perhaps close to it, and even this by a little off, is the male countertenor or a highly developed falsetto. I find that the female mezzo soprano voice is the closest to castrati singing, especially Cecilia Bartoli. Her singing in the recent Salieri Album comes dangerously close to sounding like castrati.
In the movie, creative editing and synthesizing combined a tenor's lung power and a soprano's high top register to effectively portray the sound of a castrati, which sounded like a weird blend of male and female voices, with the female being the stronger range. With that voice, coloratura is unleashed with freedom, agility and high-flung acrobatics.",1084406400,26,3498,4.870805369127517

This is a character-driven story, not a plot-driven one.  In ""Farinelli"" the essential debate in all art is fully played out on film:  From whence does artistic beauty spring?  From the interpretive vehicle or the creative one?  From the source of the inspiration or from the one who is inspired?  It even dares to ask whether there is an element of destruction in the act of creation.  The triangles outlining this debate abound.  Handel-Broschi-Farinelli is underscored by the relationships between Farinelli-Broschi-Alexandra and between Performer-Composer-Audience.  I have seen this film 6 or 7 times and I still rediscover parallels along these themes.  It is an impressive achievement to use art to outline art's own tensions without ever once losing sight of the overriding storyline or forcing your actors into unnatural posturing for the sake of making a debate point.
Others have praised the sets, acting, music, lighting--in short, the ambience and opulence of the film.  All that is here.  And yet all that is also in ""Amadeus"" and ""Immortal Beloved.""  What this offers that the others does not is the insider's take:  If you watch this movie, you will feel Farinelli's emotions, Broschi's emotions and Handel's emotions as they strive for recognition through their art.

To set matters right: The film is amazing, both as a look at 18th-century attitudes towards music, and as a story about the many different incarnations love takes. The film's sex scenes are probably some of the most beautiful around, and those that feel they are unnecessary to the film are probably looking at the past through puritanical filters. (The twentieth century did not, in fact, invent good sex...)
Castrati were, in fact, very much sex symbols in their time and farinelli, when in the service of the spanish king, was summoned ot him ""most nights to sing until one or two o'clock in the morning,"" interptet it as you will. For more information on Castrati, see ""Eunuchs and Castrati, a Cultural History"" and also The chapter on castrati in ""Singers of Italian Opera"".
As far as authenticity is concerned, the film portrays baroque audiences, with theior liveliness and level of involvement, beautifully, and I find the director's portrayal of Farinelli quite satisfactory. The machinery and decadence of the opera of the time is conveyed to perfection, and much research has obviously gone into the film.

710398,1,6303637493,"This was in a technical sense an interesting film. As everyone would know this film is about a castratii. A singer who has had his testicles cut off before puberty to preserve a boys voice. The sort of voice which was achieved by these singers is now something of a problem and the parts are sung by women. In an attempt to reproduce the sort of sound that would have occured two singers, a man and woman have tracks morphed by a computer. The sound is fascinating. The movie however is not.
The hero Farinelli apart from being one of Europes leading singers became a companion of the king of Spain in later life. He would thus have seemed to be a person of some interlect and charm.
The film however is pretty grotesque. It makes his castration the center point of the film and the basis of the entire tension and plot direction. Whilst such an operation would clearly be a bit of a shock, we would probably see it as so. For Farinelli it would not doubt be different. It was a decision which moved him from a person with no future to wealth and a place in a royal court. Of course nowdays we tend to see sexual matters as more important and the film reflects this rather modern attitude with the theme being his sense of loss and betrayal. It is his brother who has drugged and castrated him at a young age and then makes a living off him by managing him.
Despite a modern view of things being cast back on a far different time, the film is quite grotesque. Thus Farinelli's brother uses him to get girls ""in the mood"" and as they lie in bed sexually excited he comes in to finish the job his brother cannot do. Again something which is the creation of the film director to explain the co-dependance of the brothers and the shame and hostility of Farinelli.
In general the film is a dissapointment. The portrayal of the characters such as Handel is absurd. The tensions and drama within the film are contrived. The singing is however good. But over all weird, and dissapointing.",1012608000,8,1980,4.397820163487738

7853302,5,6303637493,"I saw this movie in French and Italian with no English subtitles, and while not all the ""action"" was entirely clear, it did not really matter.

The story line is very thin, and basically relates to the stardom of the incomparable early 18th century opera star Farinelli, whose family decided to when he was 10 years old to preserve his gorgeous voice via surgery that would prevent the natural development of his male voice.

Carlo Broschi (aka Farinelli), reputedly had a voice with a three octave range, so phenomenal that the second wife of Spain's Philip V, Elisabetta Farnese (Isabel de FarnesioIsabella), in 1737 persuaded him to join the Spanish court as ""Musico de Camara of Their Majesties,"" in what may well have been the first widely reported music therapy. For nine years, until Philip died in 1746, Farinelli sang a series some seven or eight arias nightly, usually with a trio of players, and reportedly worked wonders on the king's mental illness, presumed today to have been bi-polar disorder.

The film, however, concentrates on a lot of silliness that was probably not true. Castratos reportedly were quite able to make love,  but in this film Carlo Brosci either can't or won't complete the love act; that, he leaves to his brother. The film also badly misrepresents the composer George Frederic Handel, who did not favor Farinelli and did not cast him in his operas. This movie misrepresents those facts.

In any case, who cares.

What's really great about this movie is the music, and the incredible sound produced by the combined voices of an American alto countertenor and a female Czech soprano.

In the recent Globe production of Farinelli and the King at New York Belasco's Theater, British countertenor Iestyn Davies made such an impressive show of the the seven (mostly Handel) arias it includes that it's hard to believe that anyone could sound better, castrato or not, although thankfully, we shall never know.

If you like Handel operas, especially Rinaldo, this is a great movie to see. Forget the plot. Forget the subtitles. Enjoy the costumes and scenery. And mostly, just listen to the music.

I was so enchanted, I ordered a copy of the soundtrack, which I understand features several full Handel arias that the film cuts short. These include Lascia chio pianga, although featured in Rinaldo not in a role originally cast for four alto-castratos but for a female soprano playing princess Almira, the fiancee of Rinaldo.",1519862400,,2455,4.953771289537713
