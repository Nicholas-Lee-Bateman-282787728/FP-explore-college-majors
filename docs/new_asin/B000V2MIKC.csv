8216304,3,B000V2MIKC,"La Maison du Bonheur is more or less a modern-day French The Money Pit as Danny Boon's tightfisted credit manager impulsively buys a `country house' on the outskirts of Paris from Daniel Prevost's dodgy realtor as a surprise for his wife and finds himself not only having to pay out a fortune for renovations but also out of a job while trying to keep both facts a secret until he can sort it out. It ticks over pleasantly enough but it's distinctly short on laughs and amiability and a jaunty Phillipe Rombi score will only carry a film so far. It just about avoids outstaying its welcome over its 103 minutes, but it certainly won't tax your memory for long after seeing it.

The French PAL DVD boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with English subtitles and a host of unsubtitled extra features - deleted scenes, outtakes, 45-minute documentary and trailer among them.",1201046400,,875,4.718954248366013
