8054871,1,B000802E4W,"This DVD was terrible. The picture quality  was full of dots and lines and the audio quality was very quiet on two of the episodes. And as usual the theme song was replaced, and believe me, I've heard some stupid replacement music, but this takes the cake! They actually replaced the theme with some old player piano music that belongs in a movie from the 1920s! The only reason I bought it was because it was a dollar. But please, do me a favor, DON'T waist your money! Save it for something from the dollar menu at McDonald's!",1145664000,5,528,4.387755102040816

The thing that bothered me was the orignal theme song was cut out! HOW COULD THEY DO THAT?!? I can understand paying royalitys, but COME ON!",1135468800,3,256,4.244897959183674
