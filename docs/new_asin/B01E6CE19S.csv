7731586,3,B01E6CE19S,"This is a bare bones re-cap of the wonderful season the Penguins played. As other reviewers stated, just short clips of goals scored in the playoffs. The behind the scenes clips of players in the locker room are welcome, but the real reason the Penguins won the Cup was their relentless defensive play, which there is hardly any evidence of on this brief product. Hopefully, there will be another dvd released showing longer, or maybe even whole games; hey, why not a dvd showing complete games of each series final? Come on people, use your heads, give us fans what we want - we want to have a recording of how relentless this team played! Showing a couple seconds of goals scored is not what this team was about - that's for the people who don't care. This was a team for the ages!",1470873600,7,783,4.444444444444445
7731587,5,B01E6CE19S,"Even if you've watched the Pens' ""In The Room"" series for 2016, or Showtime's ""All Access"" series, this BR is still worth purchasing. They take you through the entire season, hitting on all major points, eventually culminating in the players raising the Stanley Cup.",1470787200,,266,5.068181818181818
7731588,3,B01E6CE19S,"For those of us who followed the Penguins from the tumultuous beginning of the season to the peak of exuberance at the end, this movie will come off as incomplete. Not enough time was spent on the beginning of the year, on the immense adversity that the Pens faced (middling team, Crosby in slump of his career, etc.) and it makes the movie feel more about the ending and less about the overall journey (which is something the Penguins 2009 Stanley Cup DVD did amazingly well.

Personally, I would have loved a more in depth look at the season as well as key games that showed the turnaround the team went through (PIT vs DET on New Year's Eve anyone?). I hope, from a playoffs point of view, that Showtime releases a Blu-Ray of their All-Access series and that the Penguins release their own, more in depth movie.

Still, there is something great that comes from watching a movie about your favorite team climbing to the summit of the Stanley Cup playoffs. I would definitely tell any Penguins fan to give it a watch, but would then direct them to the 2009 Cup DVD and some choice YouTube videos that truly tell the stories of one of the most amazing turnarounds in NHL history.",1469836800,18,1179,4.5046728971962615
7731589,3,B01E6CE19S,"As a penguins fan, I'm not sure how to feel about this movie. Following them for the entire season, I don't feel the movie really captured the adversity they faced, and feel like it was just short little highlights of each playoff game, which I've seen about 10 times already live and on YouTube. Maybe it's just because I know more about this team from watching them for so long, so unless they put in every detail and all the cool shots I've seen on Twitter and YouTube and live, I would be disappointed",1469750400,12,505,4.382978723404255
7731590,5,B01E6CE19S,Must have for pens fans. Great production. I couldn't wait until next season to see the penguins kick butt again.  Nice in blu ray. Cool special features,1469664000,,153,4.666666666666667

7731592,2,B01E6CE19S,"I am TRULY disappointed in this DVD!!! As a Penguins fan, I was excited as hell to get this in my hands. Unfortunately, I would have preferred that they wait a couple of more months and actually put out a decent product than putting out this item that was OBVIOUSLY rushed to market! The main feature of this DVD is only 65 minutes long and none of the 'special features' are longer than 3:45 long. By way of comparison, the 2009 Stanley Cup DVD main feature is over 100 minutes long with several of the special features clocking in at over 15 minutes plus. Additionally, the 2009 disc includes a lot of the players days with the cup, etc. With the exception of the first ten minutes about the regular season, this disc has NOTHING but short recaps of each game in the playoff series and VERY short on-ice and locker room celebrations. Just a compete disappointment!",1469577600,22,866,4.522292993630574

7731602,1,B01E6CE19S,"Very disappointed, the worst editing job I have ever seen. The hockey footage is absolutely terrible, can barley see the goals, no good camera angles, no good replays. A hockey DVDshould show good hockey shots from a high camera angle so you can actually see what's happening. It's a shame that the NHL would produce something that's such low quality. The penguins' season was amazing, the NHL needs to make better quality championship DVDs!!",1477353600,,442,4.986486486486487
7731603,5,B01E6CE19S,I watched the entire Pens Season run and even went to a few games. This is such a great reminder of all the stuff that happened in the season. It really made me feel emotional and nostaligic for the players and the last season at CONSOL Energy Center.,1477180800,,251,4.25

The DVD showed a lot of exciting highlights plus the championship game in its entirety.  What more can you ask for.  The interviews with Sid Crosby, and some of the other players plus the head coach were good.",1472947200,,314,4.654545454545454

7731623,3,B01E6CE19S,Decent recap of an awesome season.  I will agree with others that it is not as good as the 2009 DVD but it was still a good watch to relive the rise of the penguins from the mid-season ashes.,1472169600,,191,3.8974358974358974
7731624,1,B01E6CE19S,"I am not sure how this dvd received any positive reviews.  If you liked the 2009 dvd, where they recapped the big moments of the season, showed a lot of behind the scenes footage, and kept you entertained, you will not like this one.  If you instead prefer to have a dvd which simply recaps each playoff game in a manner which you could do yourself on Youtube, maybe you will like it then.",1472083200,2,389,4.243243243243243

The minute I realized it was not I had to purchase it. As usual it meets all my expectations as a diehard Penguins fan. As a sports fan i usually buy these DVDs when my team wins any national championship. I know I own this somewhere I just can't find it but now it's  in my DVD collection to watch over, and over, and over until the 2017 video arrives after our repeat performance this year.
