I decided before opening it I would look it up online, and found out that the title is ""N fei xing yuan"" and it is about ""The story of China's first group of women pilots,"" produced during the cultural revolution in 1966. And that it has no English audio or subtitles. I watched part of it just to confirm that there are no subtitle or alternative audio tracks. I was really looking forward to watching this, and it appears to be a charming movie with lots of happy music and giggling, but I don't speak Chinese so it's going back to Amazon.",1502236800,,601,4.327433628318584
