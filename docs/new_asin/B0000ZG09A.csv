8004912,5,B0000ZG09A,"I've been trying to find this DVD (PLUS some OTHER TMNT DVDs) that I missed getting when they first came out, mainly becasue I WASN'T into DVDs and DVD-players/recorders all that much when they started becoming popular.  PLUS which, the VHS versions were TONS cheaper at the time.

I am now a confirmed covert to all things DVD, however, and have begun trying to get caught up on these, so I can fully PLUG the holes in my TMNT DVD collection.

As to the DVD itself, it is WONDERFUL!  I got it WELL before the estimated delivery date (like in about 4 to 5 business days), and it plays wonderfully, and there is not a THING wrong with it.  You are now my No. 1 source for any and ALL things TMNT.  In a word, I am not a confirmed and faithful customer of Amazon.com...to the point that I have since made THREE new orders to your wonderful service!

Keep up the rad work!

Sincerely,

Regenia Johnson",1273622400,,898,4.3293413173652695
8004913,5,B0000ZG09A,"The turtles begin the search for there missing master in Lone Raph and cub, well Raph does anyway.  You need to buy Return to New York, this one, and the next two if you want the complete go round.  So this two-parter sets up events for the next season by introducing the turtles to the creepy individuals who have been watching them most of the season.  Lone Raph and Cub also foreshadows a bit into the next season when the gang boss mensions a certain gang war that is brewing.  But I agree with the last reviewer.  Don't just buy this disk, buy the next two volumes if you want the complete story arc.",1145145600,,605,4.271929824561403
8004914,2,B0000ZG09A,"This disc contains the last three episodes of TMNT season 1 - Lone Raph and Cub, and the Search For Splinter two-parter.

I'll say that I absolutely hate Lone Raph and Cub, and that it's a contender for worst episode in the series. Raph butts heads with a kid looking for his mom who has been captured by the mob. The premise is cliche, the kid is downright annoying, and the moral learned by Raph is immediately tossed out the window next episode. It's a painful filler.

The Search For Splinter is adapted from the early issues of the original comic. Note that ""Krang"" from the earlier Ninja Turtles series is based off the Utrom aliens featured here. This two-parter is nicely done and keeps the overall plot moving, but it really serves as a setup for the ""Turtles in Space"" and ""Secret Origins"" arcs, which are vol. 9 and 10 on dvd. It's not really satisfying to watch these episodes without immediately watching the ones right after.

If you're gonna buy this disc, I'd recommend picking up the ""Turtles in Space"" and ""Secret Origins"" discs as well, which will give you the complete story. Otherwise all you get is a stinker and the intro to something much larger.",1122681600,,1170,4.588516746411483
8004915,5,B0000ZG09A,"On Volume 8 we have the episode of ""Lone Raph and Cub"", in which Raph, in yet another of his hot headed moments, storms out of the liar in search for Splinter, who disappeared after the fight with Shredder. While searching for his master, Raph runs across a kid being chased by mobsters. After butting heads like a pair of bulls, the two finally manage to get along long enough for Raph to help the kid get back his mother. While the episode does tie in nicely to the ""Search for Splinter"" arc, you can watch it on it's own with out too much trouble.

 Next we have the first part of the ""Search for Splinter"" two part story arc, in which the turtles are upset and frustrated as their search for Splinter turns up nothing, when Donatello remembers the Guardians. After tailing one of the Guardians leads them to a very plain looking office building, a little investigation shows that the building belongs TCRI, the company whose canister contained the ooze that made the turtles, and Splinter, who and what they are today. Now the really want into that building, so they enlist the help of everyone favorite whackbag and his lady love, Casey and April!

 In the Second part of the ""Search for Splinter"" arc, the Turtles make it inside the TCRI building only to find that things aren't always what they seem! Watching this epsiode some of the fans from the old show might recognize the character design of the alien race, thw ""wootrons"" (Okay, so I'm not entirely sure about the name, but that's what it sounds like) as KRANG (I was like OMGDUDE It's KRANG~<3! when I saw that.), the evil, giant pulsating brain, complete with the robot bodies that carry them around in the stomach cavity. And we thought only Mikey thought with his stomach!

 All in all I love this disk, just as much as I do all the others before it. It's a great entry into the ""Turtles in Space"" arc, even if some of the lines were a bit tacky and shouldn't have been used in the situation, but nothing really made me cringe.",1090368000,2,1995,4.482093663911845
