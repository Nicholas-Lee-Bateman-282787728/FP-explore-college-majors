8686336,5,B00P31UWS6,"A DOG FOR A' SEASON is the third (and so far the last) DVD of the  Tweedhope Sheepdogs trilogy (FRAE THE CRADLE  and IN DOG WE TRUST).
I highly recommend these DVDs to everybody who 's interested in sheepdogs (Border collies) and their daily job - moving sheep!
Viv emphasises how very important FREEDOM is when training a young dog (be it for work or/and trials). You can see this freedom in DVD 1 & DVD 2 and you'll realise freedom when you watch DVD 3, the outcome. Put some polish on each dog and you'll have poetry in motion, like ballet.
Beautiful landscape, impressive dogs combined with helpful & very useful training tips and never miss out some fun for the watcher's amusement ;-)
I personally love all these DVDs because they're very professionally filmed and I believe it is of high importance to pass on this wisdom for the sake of the most outstanding breed ever.
Thank you for making these films, Viv & Fi.",1417910400,,921,4.508982035928144
