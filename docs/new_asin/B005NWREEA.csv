8480807,2,B005NWREEA,Get the serials instead.  These TV shows are dark and gloomy and not lighthearted fun like Dick Tracy's cliffhanger serials!,1366329600,,124,5.2
8480808,5,B005NWREEA,"The Dick Tracy series of the 1950s starring Ralph Byrd is a rare treat indeed. There are 4 episodes runing roughly 1/2 hr each, as well as a movie, Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome, which stars Ralph Byrd and Boris Karloff. On the TV show, Dick battles such crime meanies as The Mole, a criminal bigwig out to make counterfeit money, and Heal Beels, a low grade hood posing as a furniture restorer. If you're a fan of D.T. you'll enjoy these episodes.",1316476800,2,444,4.426829268292683
