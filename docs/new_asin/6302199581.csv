So its 6 kids trying to outwit and outsmart dangerous people wanting their weapons back who will do anything to get the kids and their weapons back.

441372,4,6302199581,"""Edge of Honor"" tells the story of two boy scouts named Luke (Scott Reeves) and Butler (Corey Feldman) who stumble across an array of weapons, and they decide to come back at a later time to get them.  However, Luke accidently leaves his map to the boy scout camp behind, and the men who own the weapons, find this map, and kill everyone except for three people at the camp.  Luke and Butler and their friends realize they must fight back for their survival.  This movie was cool, and the action sequences are awesome!

441373,3,6302199581,"This movie, set on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, follows the adventures of 5 scouts as they accidently stumble upon illegal gun-running.
There's plenty of action but not an overly engaging plot.  Corey Feldman, reunited with Meredith Salenger (Dream a Little Dream), seems to be impersonating Christian Slater.  Daniel Wartman gives a particularly good performance.",998438400,3,372,5.745454545454545

7822889,5,6302199581,"This movie never gets old. Maybe I have a biased opinion because I used to watch this movie everyday back in the 90s when I was a kid! It's got action, a good story, decent acting, and good 90s non-computer generated special effects.",1392854400,,233,4.441860465116279

7822893,3,6302199581,its an ok '91 movie.  some highlights.  has a very ludget too so proceed with caution as some acting or scenes might be cringle worthy. best acting was by the young actors though.  they make the story work.  the others  are plain stupid and like rejects from a cop show,1337644800,,269,4.3
7822894,4,6302199581,"Arrived in time for Christmas, which was very good.  The movie was in fine condition, and we expected that.  However, we had to turn up the sound real high on our TV to hear it..",1334534400,,178,4.057142857142857
