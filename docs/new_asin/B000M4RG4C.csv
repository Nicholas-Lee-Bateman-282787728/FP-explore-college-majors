2723691,1,B000M4RG4C,"Movie was good, but now that I know it's based on a lie I'll never watch it again. John Bradley was not one of the six flag raiser and he lied about it. His lie stole valor from the real flag raiser, Marine Harold Schultz. Bradley was removed from battle so he could go home to sell war bonds, and be honored as a hero while Schultz remained on Iwo Jima, and continued to fight till the end of the battle.

We both found various parts of it very heart-warming, and other parts (the political and show business parts) revolting. As people who worked in the film and television industry for years, we could readily identify with how disturbing and misleading the corruption in politics and Hollywood might be to someone ripped from among his buddies on ""the front lines"" of combat to be placed on a pedestal and the front lines of the media in order to sell goods or services - in this case, war bonds.",1467676800,,765,4.510791366906475

2723746,3,B000M4RG4C,The story of the planting of the two flags on Mount Suribachi on Iwo. It focuses on the hype behind the War Bond tour of the 3 surviving members of the final flag raising party.

2723757,3,B000M4RG4C,"I biggest complaint is this.  This movie should have been filmed in Black & White.  Color made it appear unrealistic.  This story was informative but lacked authenticity on account of the color.  My father served in Pearl Harbor and the Philippines and never once mentioned the color including the blood, once in his limited retelling of the atrocities suffered by himself and his comrades. He told me of Iwo Jima and the true flag raisers so this was known to me since I was a little girl",1460246400,,489,4.586206896551724

2723789,5,B000M4RG4C,"A most excellent film. One of the few times the book and the film do this story of horrific battle justice. The psychological aftermath of what they endured is beyond reason. Then these wonderful men without thought or consequence were told to parade for the sake of war bonds. If only they were aware of PTSD. This is a sad account of the misery of war, but it is inspiring in regards to the spirit of the average fighting man whose life is changed forever.

2723796,5,B000M4RG4C,"Flag of our Fathers is especially good because out is the brother to ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" Flag of our fathers is Iwo Jima from the American view and its aftermath. There is the horror of war with graphic seen that made me wince. This movie also brings to light that these individuals were just kids in their late teens and early 20's Hey I did not know that the photograph I am familiar was the 2nd flag raising. Its aftermath is informative sad and a little depressing. It is though a movie that all Americans can see. We have much to be grateful to these brave heroic men. We need to treat all our soldiers in uniform and veterans much better than we do at present and the past. Watch this movie and do not forget.",1437782400,,719,4.255474452554744

2723823,4,B000M4RG4C,"Excellent perspective, but short on background and details. While Eisenhower breached Hitler's impenetrable wall on the Normandy coast in 24-hours, the battle of Iwo Jima, a 2-mile by 5-mile volcanic rock, took nearly 40 days, killing some 22,000 Japanese soldiers, all or whom were told they would die in the battle, and were instructed to kill at least 10 Americans before being killed.  U.S. forces suffered 26,000 American casualties - the only American invasion in history in which the U.S. suffered more casualties than the defending forces.
I think every young person should watch FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS for the American perspective, then the companion movie,  LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA to understand the Japanese.  Clint Eastwood is among my favorites, however, he may have bit off more than can be adequately covered in one, or even two, 2-hour movies.  Good action movie, but short on why both sides were there.

2723846,2,B000M4RG4C,"Clint Eastwood has made many really solid films. This isn't one of them. The characters are not sufficiently developed, so it's hard to care about any of them. He doesn't earn the sympathy (or empathy) we're supposed to feel for Ira Hayes. The film is also poorly edited. It's as if Eastwood shot a bunch of scenes (mostly of people in ballrooms) and then patched them together. The film moves from scene to scene (from ballroom to battlefield) without intelligible transitions, and then ends with a Stand By Me moment--a guy at a typewriter reflecting on his father's experience in the war. In short, watching Flags of Our Fathers is tedious. Eastwood is good filmmaker, but this effort is a disappointment.",1422230400,,708,4.859504132231405

2723857,4,B000M4RG4C,"When I was dratfed into the U. S. Army in 1959 I was teaching high school history and English in a Chicago public high school and going to law school at night.  Quite logically, the Army made me a newspaper reporter radio newsman.  One of my duties was to write an article on a famous battle in American history each week for the Fort Leonard Wood Sentinel, our post newspaper.  Since may older brother Jack ""celebrated his 20th birthday at Iwo Jima on the day of the initial landing, Fedbuary 19, 1945, I chose it as one of my first batles about which to write.  I later (it wasn't written until the 1990s, after the death of the main character, John ""Doc"" Bradley I read with interest the book by ""Doc's"" son, James Bradley called ""Flags of Our Fathers.""  Went to see Clint Eastwood's movie severaltimes, as I do with most promising war movies - - -usually go with somel of my friends who are also veterans and, often coax my own sons to go also, on the premise that they're fortunate to live in the age of a volunteer military so that they don't have to go, leave behind their civilians lives, risk their own lies, and be gone from their loved ones, sometimes for years!
Anyway, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" was an interesting movie with action-packed battle scenes and quite a bit of character development (sometimes lacking in the genre); but it sikpped around too much for me, thereby damaging its continuity.  For a totally different reason, I wrote a letter to Mr. Eastwood about what I perceived to be a huge flaw in the movie, but have yet to hear back from him on the issue!  The misinterpretation of history (or the simple telling of a lie - - -and I can imagine no apparent reason for such a purposeful mistruth) concerns the scene in which the three remaining flag-raisers (half of the iconic photo's flag-raisers) had alraedy died in action before the military got the idea to send them back to the States for help sell war bonds) are meeting with an assistant secretary of the treasuy (oe some such official) and Ira Hayes, an American Indian from Sacaton, AZ (near where I currently live in retirement - - -there's a statue of him in the center of town there)  says that he'd like to go back to be with his friends in the Marines to help them successfully conclude the capture of the island.  The functionary tells him that, if he goes back, he'd better take a pocketfull of rocks to throw at the Jap troops because the U. S. is about out of money and can't afforn all the weapons a war requires.  He further says we''l be having to ask the Japs  for peace, on their terms, soon.  Nothing could be further from the truth!!!!.  When the war finally ended with Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945 and the official signing of the surrender documents aboard the U.S.S Missouri on September 4, 1945, we had more left-over weapons than all of the other combatants combined!  We dulldozed millions of dollars worth of weapons and munitions into the ocean on several islands we'd conquered along the ""road to Tokyo.""  Other great stores of military items we dumped into the ocean.  The Japanese, on the other hand, were even hard pressed to find amunition for many of their aging rifles!  Clint's audience for this movie - - -generally not knowing the real facts - - -likely believed this distortion of history and were led to think we were close to defeat..  Again, nothing could be further from the truth.  Military planners, on all sides, understood that the Japanesewere doomed to defeat as far back as June, 1942 when we turned the tide of the Pacific war at the Battle of Midway!  I never could understand why Mr Eastwood purposely led the movie's viewers to think that we were the ones on the brink of defeat!",1418342400,,3734,4.536512667660209

It is not pretty.  Flags of Our Fathers demands that those of us who have the luxury to watch it apply a very small portion of the discipline, commitment and courage required of those who came before us who had that trial and others like it as their task.

2723938,5,B000M4RG4C,"In two and a half hours Clint Eastwood paints a thought provoking piece on heroism and war-propaganda. The film tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island. In the style of Saving Private Ryan (Spielberg is a producer of Flags) the viewer gets a astounding look at war with a lot of blood, guts and CGI. Second is the story of a son of one of the flag raisers on that island, who interviews other survivors of that battle to understand his dad a little better. This is very moving stuff, but stands a little pale in comparison to the final storyline. This is where veteran-director Eastwood really shines. Like his meditation on violence Unforgiven, Flags takes a closer look at heroism where soldiers by chance get into the spotlight of the war-propaganda-machine. Some may say that Eastwood made an anti-war film or even an anti-America film, but they're wrong. Flags is very critical on the way war is sold to the public. There's nothing honorable about killing or to be killed on the battlefield. The only thing that matters is that you protect you're friends in your platoon and that they protect you. Flags is one of the best war movies I ever saw, maybe even better than Ryan, because it's never sentimental and always honest in its portrayal of the soldiers and war in general.",1375142400,,1385,4.703703703703703

2723949,5,B000M4RG4C,"One of the best things about growing older is that you have an ever-wider range of memories. For example. when I was in the first grade, I can clearly remember the onset of World War II.  We all sat around that night feeling very anxious as we listened to the radio hearing the account of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It's something I'll never forget. Within about six months, Dad was drafted and we had to move about half way across the continent where Dad worked in a Kaiser Shipyard making Victory Ships for two years in Vancouver, Washington. We'd have air raid warnings every now and then just to get prepared if the bombers were ever to actually arrive. It was scary for a little kid, and probably for the adults as well.

Then I remember one day how the newspaper carried a good-sized photo of a half-dozen marines raising the American Flag on the island of Iwo Jima. Everyone seemed so proud and felt that the war was essentially over. Well, it still had a long way to go but that event was a real uplifter for the American spirits. The movie tells the tale of that raising. What your reaction might  be depends on your mental framework. If you're a bit of a cynic, you might find it interesting and informative. If you're more of a blind patriot, you may find it disturbing and despise the movie. Either way, be prepared fora lot of violence and some really graphic photography. War isn't pretty, and this film will provide a lot of stomach-churning stress if you're at all squeamish. The story isn't straight-line telling. Be prepared for a lot of advances and flash backs interspersed so that the flag-raising event can be studied from many different viewpoints. Be prepared to find out that the event is not what you thought and was probably more propaganda than you had ever imagined. However you view it, the flag raising was probably one of the most important visual events ever and you'll still see the photo dozens of times per year even  though this event occurred about 70 years ago.

This movie is very interesting and important. Don't miss it if you're interested in U.S. history. It's exceptionally well done, although it can be hard to follow because of  the structure. Well, the story isn't as simple as it might appear from a distance. There aren't any ""movie stars"" in the picture. If  there's a star, it should  be Clint Eastwood, the director and he should receive some big gold metal or such. Well  done! If you get interested in  this WW II event. be sure to also watch ""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" a story of  the same battle but with a Japanese perspective.

As best I can determine, I think most of the distance is from the writing.  I felt at a distance with the characters, with the partial exception of the characterization of Ira Hayes (whom I was only previously familiar with through Bob Dylan's retelling of Peter LaFarge's song, ""The Ballad Of Ira Hayes"").  Hayes's struggles with what he was compelled to do for the war effort -- essentially be part of a PR campaign that had little to do with ""truth"" -- made his the most three-dimensional characterization in a film filled with one-dimensional forgettable/interchangable characters.

2723960,5,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags of Our Fathers"", directed by Clint Eastwood, is a great, visually stunning piece of cinema about the soldiers responsible for the planting of the American flag on the beach of Iwo Jima during WW 2 and how it not only led to one of the most iconic photographs in military history but how it affected the lives and psyches of the soldiers who fought in that battle to take the island from the Japanese forces. Ryan Phillipe, Jesse Bradford, and Adam Beach play three of the soldiers and Eastwood does a masterful job exploring each character thoroughly and how what should have been a whirlwind, fun tour back home concerning their part in the planting of the flag on the island and promoting the photo as well as the cult of celebrity, but how they were just trying to keep their heads firmly together and letting people know they were ""just young men doing their duty for their beloved USA"". Sometimes, the media can prop soldiers up to be titans, but back home in the real world, reality can knock you down a peg when you least expect it. It's all about the proper prospective as far as being a man in the heat of battle is concerned, and who cares for your efforts and who doesnt when the guns stop firing. A great war film, and Eastwood's companion piece ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is even more powerful and heartbreaking.",1337731200,,1329,4.518672199170124
2723961,5,B000M4RG4C,"Flag of our fathers

Flag of Our Fathers is a movie made from a book with the same title, written by James Bradley and Ron Powers. This incredible movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, is about the famous photo of the Marine Soldiers raising the American Flag, taken during the Battle of Iwo Jima at the end of the II World War in 1945. The main characters; Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes and John Bradly, were the survivors of the Battle and they were the ones on the famous photo.

This movie is told by one of the soldiers' grown-up son, who wants to find out what happened to his father. He interviews his father and the fellow soldiers in order to reveal the story of the famous photo.
The movie takes place in three different times: during the battle, during the celebration of victory and in the present in 1994.

Flag of Our Fathers is not just about war violence and blood, as much people would think. It is much more of a drama than a war movie. It shows a mixture between emotional and battle scenes that are extremely well done, making an impressive viewing.
All along the movie they showed random flashbacks of Suribashi being shelled by US Marines. Incredible special effects were used and, even if those scenes are brief, they manage to show the hardships of the war. However, the main focus remains on the feelings of the soldiers, when they go back to the US and were greeted as heroes. They were forced to lie about the reality of that historical moment. The photo used as a memorial event wasn't the original one; it was taken with a replacement flag. Those soldiers weren't the ones who fight against Japanese. The survivors were the soldiers that avoid being wounded and their mission was to save the wounded Fighters. Real heroes died days after raising the flag.
The tour they had to make in order to collect money was a farce, and the guilt and nightmares of war made a huge difference to their lives giving the movie an emotional dimension.

This is a great representation of what government is capable of doing for raise money for its own benefit and how terrible, sad and intense the war was for soldiers during and after being on the battle field.

I also spent half the movie going: ""Oh, look, it's the crazy murderous husband from 'Desperate Housewives.' There's the guy from 'Mad Men' and the crazy neighbor chick from 'Two And a Half Men.' "" Very distracting to put such TV stars in the bit roles.

2723976,5,B000M4RG4C,"I have never seen a movie like it, with such a complex interweaving of ideas, events, and characters.  It is a masterpiece that riveted me from beginning to end, brought me to tears as I remembered my own recently deceased father, and inspired me once again with the wonders of history, of evolving societies, and individual tragedy.  Eastwood is one of the greatest movie men who has ever lived.

Prior to popping this into the DVD player, I was expecting it to be a simple war movie, in a way the mirror image of the wonderful Letters from Iwo Jima that portrayed the drama of the Japanese soldiers on the island with sympathy and intelligence.  Instead, after a brief action sequence that forced me to get the kids out of the TV room, I discovered that the film was more about 3 soldiers who were supposedly in the famous flag-raising photo.  They were taken to the US to serve as salesmen for war bonds, presented as heroes and fetted by the nation as celebrities.  Without taking any cheap shots, this adds a layer of irony that worked for me.

Eastwood has several narratives gong at the same time, masterfully interwoven like a tapestry.  First, you have the stories of the boys themselves, clean marines who have little idea about where they are headed.  There are a sensitive Indian, braving many stereotypical slights about his race; an incompetent whom his superiors protect by making him a message runner behind the allied lines; and a straight-forward, courageous medic.  After an odd circumstance where a second flag is raised and enshrined by the iconic photo, these 3 boys are pulled from action and taken to accompany the Treasury Secretary on a massive fund raising trip for the War.  With the exception of the weak incompetent, they feel guilty about leaving their comrades and ashamed.  The Indian, Ira, is particularly torn and this brings out a terrible self-destructive streak.

Second, the boys are held in the grip of traumatic memories from their experiences on Iwo Jima, images that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.  As they go through their duties, images and scenes pass through their minds with extraordinary vividness.  Interesting, while frighteningly realistic - you see many characters you got to know suddenly killed off - Eastwood refrains from showing the most gruesome images, such as a boy who was apparently tortured to death by mutilation (he was a ""buddy"" of the medic, who speaks of him on his death bed in a scene).  There are many moving scenes where the boys meet the parents of their fellows.

Third, the son of the medic is leading an investigation into the real story, which his father never told him.  He meets many of his father's friends, who bring out new stories and perspectives.  His story comes up to the present, when he lays his father to rest.  This last scene was so well done that I re-lived the death of my own father and wept openly.

The themes are so deep that I will watch this again and must read the book.  Eastwood questions the nature of heroism, portraying the heros as boys, each of them with their own sense of honor, fear, and courage.  Linked to this, Eastwood also portrays their use as political propaganda tools, however useful and needed they were to the war effort, which Eastwood never implies was unjust.  It is an interesting balance that is aware of hypocrisy yet not at all cynical.  YOu also watch the impact of fame on their lives, in which Ira's story is so painful to behold as he spirals downward.  Finally, the brutality of war and survival is there, though much of it seems mere luck and accident as the characters are mowed down on a stark rocky island rather than heroism.  There is some interesting overlap with Letters from Iwo Jima.

REcommended with the greatest enthusiasm.",1296777600,,3785,4.719939117199391
2723977,5,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags of Our Fathers"" is a film of many themes. The outstanding theme of all focused on seven Marines. After the United States won the battle of Iwo Jima, some Americans put a flag up on Mount Suribachi. A picture is taken when they are doing this. This single photo makes its way back to the States and his printed in Newspapers across the country. In effort to raise bonds, the press requests that the six men who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi be sent home to help raise money for bonds.

What makes this film interesting is that instead of solely focusing on the flag-raising story, director Clint Eastwood includes the story of the battle of Iwo Jima.

""Flags of Our Fathers"" is a very deep film, full of meaning and honor. The music adds an extraordinary piece to this film, which was done by Clint Eastwood.

Both Clint Eastwood (director, producer, music) and Steven Spielberg (producer) make an excellent team. If you are a fan of World War II films or want to see a truly touching film, I highly recommend ""Flags of Our Fathers.""",1290988800,,1044,4.542553191489362
2723978,4,B000M4RG4C,"Facts are revealed behind the famous photo of soldiers raising the American flag in Iwo Jima not generally known.  This is also a good expose of military marketing as the three survivors got literally paraded around football stadiums.  Standout performance of Adam Beach, the native American who deeply troubled by the ordeal.  Best seen with Letters from Iwo Jima and considered this one of director Clint Eastwood's best work.

Somewhat more workman are the performances of Ryan Phillipe and Jesse Stanford.  Phillip's character doesn't ask for much and knows there's nothing glorious about being in a war.  Stanford's character saw the media tour as a possible business opportunity.  Eastwood's music adds to the sour elegance to the whole proceedings.

The opening sequences are very good and strongly suspect it's co-producer Steilberg's main contribution.  Eastwood is one Westerner who has given good portrayals of the native Americans.  The Outlaw Josie Whales that he starred and directed only shows the killing of whites.  As remarked by many, he's grown since then.",1289606400,,1076,5.3076923076923075

2723980,2,B000M4RG4C,"I was expecting a harrowing movie about war.  Kind of like what ""Saving Private Ryan"" was for Normandy, only for the Battle of Iwo Jima.

As deft as Eastwood is as a director, I feel this is largely a forgettable, medicore film.  A couple of these reasons are Eastwood's fault; a couple of them he couldn't have done anything about.

1.  The characters all look the same!  Since you couldn't tell them apart, it was hard to get going with their stories.  Which one is Hank?  Which one is Harlon?  (I also had this complaint about the companion movie, but if say that there it would be dismissed as racism.)

2.  Unlike Normandy, the Battle of Iwo Jima simply does not lend itself well to cinematic vigor, except for the shot of the fleet from atop Suribachi.

3.  The story of the Indian had no insights.  Yeah, it's interesting that that was an Indian guy.  But I think Eastwood had no idea what to say about it and no idea what to do:  in end, you just end up getting another stereotypical drunk Indian story.

4.  Regrettably, it seemed like Eastwood torpedoed the whole theme of sacrifice by getting into the boys back home having to stump around selling war bonds.  Sure, this was hucksterism, but is that really the direction the film should have took?  In the end, it was almost as if the movie wasn't about soldiers and sacrifice, but the literal truth of the flag's having been placed and re-placed.  This was an unfortunate decision.

5.  Jumping back and forth around in time was not recommended:  it made everything much more confusing.",1277337600,,1548,4.545454545454546

The government brings the three survivors to America to raise funds of war, bringing hope to desolated people, and making the three men heroes of war. However, the traumatized trio has difficulties to deal with the image build by their superiors, sharing the heroism with their mates.  Clint Eastwood paints a thought provoking piece on heroism and war-propaganda. This movie tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island. Some of the movie is graphically violent and shows the dark side of war, and the effects war has on our returning soldiers.

I even watched it again just to be fair thinking maybe I had had a bad night.  No, it was even worse the second time.

Let me say that I was incredibly moved by the book.  It made the human experience of WWII real to me in a way that no History Channel documentary ever could.  I felt I knew the characters and was moved to tears by their stories.

The screenplay and direction of this film is so muddled and disjointed that, if I hadn't read the book, I don't know if I could have even figured out who the characters were.  There is virtually no character development so it's hard to know who the people are or why they are doing what they do in the film - or why you should care.

Made understandable the structure of the film which somewhat puzzled and a little disturbed me as I saw it. Felt the interweaving of combat with later events weakened the impact of each. However, turns out the book was an extensive study of the lives of 6 men and the combat which united them at the pole on which they placed and raised the American flag on a hill in Iwo Jima. Not having a mini-series of  10 or more hours at their disposal and yet having to, (by contractual arrangement), or wanting to, they had to cover both facets of the book in one two hour movie. They did a fine job. The combat scenes stand up very well, the civilian scenes less so since the personalities formed in the early years prior to service might have explained better the situational accommodations made to post-combat conditions. At any rate, this is a film worth seeing mostly for the thesis that men (and, now, women )in  combat are mostly ordinary people who have to adjust to extraordinary circumstances and react often in extraordinary ways. While the brutality of war is suggested,  no film can convey the extent to which fear, hatred, the close bonds of the primary group in the military, the shattering of bodies and souls, and sheer necessity create a boiling cauldron out of which anything can emerge.

You learn about the men who raised the flags(yes there were TWO flags raised that day. The flag that became famous and which the picture won a Pulitzer prize was hardly even noticed when these Marines changed the first flag out, because a politician wanted that first flag) in a way that was never told before.

I thought they did a convincing job of showing us how facts and reality can be so liquid, how the government and military tries to manipulate the public and, ultimately, how the public so craves certain icons--heroes to hold high on their shoulders, worthy of such status or not--that they're willing to believe whatever they're sold. The war scenes I found brutally effective and gripping, something you just kind of sit there and absorb in a trance, vaguely thankful that the path of your life has never taken you there. I was also struck by the casual, accepted racism towards the Native American Ira Hayes. What a different world it was then, worse in many ways, but so much better in others as well. Using a cast of relative no-name actors also added to the overall effect for me; rarely was I thinking, Oh I remember him from some other movie or TV show. I did feel it dragged on at the end, getting perhaps overly sentimental with certain aspects. But still, I liked it overall.

2723994,5,B000M4RG4C,"This film concerns the last real fierce emblematic battle (February 19, 1945  March 26, 1945) between the USA and Japan, the battle for the island of Iwo Jima. The war is coming to an end and after this battle, it will drag on with Japan retreating little by little and this will only be stopped once and for all with the atom bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At the end of this battle, the federal government of the USA is unable to finance the end of the war and they use this battle, this victory as the tool they need to launch a final battle in the USA to raise the money necessary to finish the job.

But when this battle is finished, won the main actor of this war, Franklin D. Roosevelt dies within weeks on April 12, 1945, and Truman takes over. He is the one who decided to drop the atom bombs in Japan, though of course, Roosevelt is the one who had launched the research and financed the production of these bombs, little boy as the first one was called. Dramatic event that required the levying of millions if not billions of dollars to pay for the next six months of the war.

This first film  that has to be twinned with Letters from Iwo Jima  is the battle seen from the American point of view and whats more from the recollections the son of one of the GIs who raised the flag there managed to collect from his father before his death, and the father expressed in his last weeks or months of life the great distance he had taken with this war and this battle. The film shows with all the horror and bloody cruelty you can imagine this battle and how the GIs reacted and survived because thats the master word here: The Gis did all they could to survive and avoid the bullets. Their choice was simple: go through the showering bullets, remain alive, and kill as many people on the other side. Prisoners were not even a question.

Then the film shows how three surviving soldiers who raised the flag are enrolled in a campaign across the USA to raise money, including by the reenactment of the raising of the flag. But it is all built on a fake picture. The first raising of the flag was not taken by the photographer following the armed forces, a GI himself, because he was not thre at the time. He only took the second raising but in the meantime, one of the four Gis who did it was dead or gone and he was replaced by a second fourth one who will die soon after. The picture that was sent around in the press and the media all over the world cheated then on the identity of this fourth soldier. And both fourth soldiers dying soon after and not being there anymore to testify, two mothers, two families were suffering from the ambiguity.

The truth came from one of the three survivors, the Indian GI, who later on, after the war, leaked the truth to the press. The fact that remains is that the federal state and the American political apparatus used this picture and this event for years with even the erecting of a monument representing this particular event. What is important in such situation? The real truth or the dynamism that the official but false truth creates? The reality is that very often the hypocritical truth is the one that works in the media, most of the time because the media do not know it is fake. And today some speak of fake news!

The three survivors will have very different careers after the war. The Indian will die officially from exposure sometime after the inauguration of the official commemorative monument, without an autopsy, meaning that an Indian is an Indian and his being a national hero does not count: he is still refused a drink in a bar that does not serve Indians, even when the whole city around the bar is celebrating on this very evening the three survivors and the raising of the flag in a monstrous event in some stadium. The next GI will never get a decent job, nor decent training or education, and he will be a janitor all his life. The last one will have the opportunity to buy a funeral parlor and will prosper as a mortician and he is the one whose son is collecting the last memories.

The general idea is that if heroes there are they are all dead: the heroes are those who died in the battle. The survivors were just die-hard lucky survivors who managed to run through a torrentuous shower of projectiles of all sorts and did not get wet at all. Dry till the end, or maybe one or two drops, one or two wounds, but nothing serious enough to put you six feet under. In 2006 the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were getting clogged up in a quagmire and Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg had the courage to tell the wide audience that a war is never anything clean, heroic and that it is essentially a cruel game played by people far away from the front who will use the survivors to reach their objectives provided these survivors do NOT, absolutely NOT, question the basic principles of the society whose elite the war-players at home are, namely segregation and class distinctions, not to mention racism and racial distinctions.

The USA was starting to come back from the brink of the precipice by then in 2006 and a new president was going to be elected. Unluckily after that new president, another came who wants today again to bring us to the brink of that very same precipice. History does not repeat itself but as Lenin used to say: One step forward, two steps back. But Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg went one step further after this first step, hence two steps forward, and they produced the second film about this battle, this time from the Japanese point of view.

2723997,1,B000M4RG4C,"What a stinker!  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that I did not enjoy ""Flags of our Fathers"" because I really disliked the nasty, brutish and too long ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and it was supposed to be the better film. But hey--I just couldn't imagine that Eastwood could make TWO boring films about Iwo Jima.

Boy, was I wrong!

I need to explain that I'm a military history buff and so my credibility with some people is going to be marginal.  After all, anybody who actually studies military tactics who isn't in the military probably has other strange hobbies.  So, that being said, I want to make it clear that Sgt. Stryker (the John Wayne character from ""Sands of Iwo Jima"") would really, really hate ""Flags of Our Fathers.""  He'd hate it not because of the blatant sentimentalism or the washed-out looking color (CGI has a way to go, eh?) or the incoherent story.  He'd just be appalled by the fact that the Marines can't keep their heads down. They can't hit the dirt and dig in.  They just walk around on the beach, looking serious, and get shot.

Stryker would stand up in the theater (or home theater) and yell ""Get down!  Ya wanna get your head blown off!""  Yeah, THAT'S what he'd do...

Seriously, folks, I'm tired of seeing these so-called ""war movies"" like ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Blackhawk Down"" where troops just diddly-bop around in a hot environment and ask to get shot.  It's dumb.

I repeat, no sane person walks around in broad daylight with live ammo flying around in the air.

""But...but... HOW DO THEY MOVE?"" you may ask. ""How do they win the battle?""  ""How do they do heroic stuff and take the island and defeat the Nazi's or whatever?""

I'll answer that.  They do it SLOWLY and CAREFULLY so as not to get their binkus shot off.  They are ""pinned down"" by enemy fire until they can figure out a way to eliminate the threat.  What made Iwo Jima so terrible was that, for about a day, the entire invading force was ""pinned down"" and could not dig into the sand, so they just lay there, hoping and praying not to get blown up by the artillery and mortar rounds that were slowly killing the Marines on the beach.

That would have made an interesting ""realistic"" movie.  THAT would have been a realistic movie.

2724001,2,B000M4RG4C,"The film begins with a lone soldier looking over the black sand. It is a flashback. Does a single picture win or lose a war? [No!] The famous photo of the flag raising was popular as it stood for victory over the enemy. One medic rescues a wounded soldier, then defends himself with a knife. [Irony?] There is a flashback to Camp Tarawa. The Marines are training for an invasion. Iwo Jima is heavily fortified. Mount Suribachi has the big guns and is an important target. The Navy shells the island with all guns. Can they take the island in three days? The Marines land without enemy fire - until they are exposed in the open. They neutralize a machine gun nest. The wounded are carried back for treatment.

Those who raised the flag in that picture were sent back to the states, if they survived. They were used for publicity to sell war bonds. The need for money is explained. They meet President Truman. Allied armies were then in Germany. [Did people expect the war was about to end?] Another flashback explains the second raising of the bigger flag. There is more drama back in the states during the bond drive. The survivors are encouraged to help in the effort. The capture of Iwo Jima allowed its use as an airfield for bombers. The film then shows their lives after the war. They were yesterday's heroes. The film winds down in a sentimental ending.

This film recreates the invasion of the island. Computer-generated images created realistic backgrounds for this film. The story suffers from too many jumps in continuity or flashbacks. The end of the credits says ""dialogue and certain events and characters contained in the film were created for the purpose of dramatization"". ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" remains the best film about this event and will never be surpassed because of its nearness to the event. And it had a better director, producer, and writers. This film is cynical in treating the flag raising as just a publicity device for fund raising.

2724006,4,B000M4RG4C,"I agree with some of the previous reviewers comments - particularly in relation to confusion over the main characters. However as with most of Clint Eastwoods films this has a depth to it that is missing from the majority of films. It is beautifully shot. Clint Eastwood has defintely watched John Ford films. There was one shot with a character framed in a doorway, which could have been straight out of the Searchers.

The battle scenes which are spread throughout the film are well done and the effect they have on the main characters is profound. I don't want to see 2 hours of continuous carnage, so the jump cuts to different times were a welcome relief from the horrors of war. The sequences where the 'heroes' are dragged round to raise money for the war effort seemed very authentic, and I could feel myself getting angrier as it went along. Having been traumatised by the war, when you return to the US you don't get to be with your family, you are treated like a commodity to raise money.

Ultimately it is a rather depressing film, but sometimes I need to watch an honest movie about the awful effects of war rather than a purely gung-ho film (which have their place). See this and then watch Clint Eastwoods companian film 'Letters from Iwo Jima' which looks at the same battle from the Japanese point of view and is probably the better of the two films.",1235174400,,1367,4.5528455284552845

2724011,2,B000M4RG4C,"In Flags of Our Fathers, director Clint Eastwood attempts to deliver a stirring and thought provoking film that honors the sacrifices made by the veterans of World War II, while at the same time fixing a critical gaze on the U.S. government for their exploitation of those vets to promote public support of the war.  Kudos to Clint for thinking big, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew in this case.

The movie shifts back and forth between the bloody battle of Iwo Jima, where we watch young men afraid and dying as they fight for each other more so than their county and, the home front where three soldiers who were part of the iconic flag raising picture travel around the country encouraging people to support the war.  The idea that the movie is driving at is that the photo, considered one of the most famous of the 20th century, wasn't what the public thought it was.  It was actually a picture of soldiers replacing the initial flag that was planted.  The soldiers in the picture never felt that their flag raising act was heroic, but that's how the government wanted it spun in order to keep hope alive among the masses.

The movie attempts to portray the conflicted emotions carried by the soldiers as they play the role of heroes even though they know the truth, but none of the characters is developed well enough to make us care about what they are feeling.  As for the war scenes, they are well done but they feel like Saving Private Ryan warmed over.  There is no immedicacy or fear.  Eastwood isn't able to put you there in the thick of things the way Speilberg did.

The end result is a movie that often feels muddled and confused and lacks a center.  It's a movie about ideas and questions, but it forgets to engage the audience in any real or meaningful way.",1229990400,,1796,4.461773700305811

2724015,1,B000M4RG4C,"Definitely not styled after Tom Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation, which accounts why the generation of the WWII era was one of America's finest.  This movie was made with a sort of cynicism about our Greatest Generation that seems to only drain the audience's attention.  By focusing too much on the 'bad' side of America during the War in the Pacific, Clint Eastwood overlooks the good that America can stand for leaving the viewer with their own battle fatigue.  Jumping from the war to modern times and back again and again during the whole movie was like being drug through the mud having to endure another one of hollywood's cynical anti-American rantings.

Poorly made and although it had potential, the movie will leave you wondering what message it is the viewer is supposed to swallow.  The general message, I think, is: 'dislike your country for standing up to Imperial Japan, because underneath it all we were all just a bunch of jerks and that we should have lost'.",1226707200,,982,4.821428571428571

2724020,3,B000M4RG4C,"This is one of those movies of which each of the ingredients makes your mouth water, yet the sum of the parts leaves a slightly flat taste.
First of all, lets say, this is a film worth watching, with an interesting message, great cinematography and terrific acting.  However, the decision to straddle two types of story weakens the stories impact, and the end result feels just a little too unfocussed to really work well.
The story follows 3 of the surviving men of the famous photo of raising the flag on Iwo Jima.  The photo becomes an iconic image of victory, and the government seizes the opportunity to use the survivors to tour the US exhorting the public to buy War Bonds.  To understand the film a little better, it is necessary to go in realizing that this is not a historical dramatization of the Battle of Iwo Jima in the traditional war movie sense, although scenes from that conflict are brutally realistically portrayed, in true post-Ryan terms.  It really only shows those war scenes as scattered flashbacks of the veterans as they are paraded around America to help sell the war.  In using the flashbacks to show the battle, we are being led to understand not what the moment of war itself is like, but how the memories of certain moments within a war can stay with you and haunt you, or in the case of Ira Hayes, drive you to drink.  It's a different way of looking at the horror of war than we usually get - however the effect of that is weakened by layering another level of flashbacks to the same events, viewed as the son of one of the men interviews his fathers friends to find out more about what happened to him.  It's an unnecessary complication which weakens the movie.  A second theme is the obvious one about the role of propaganda - how the act of allowing a lie to sell the truth becomes its own form of corruption.
And so, we go bouncing between these two central ideas as we see how the 3 survivors react differently to their new found `fame'.  The leads are all fine, and the cinematography as we have come to expect in an Eastwood movie is great - but the end result feels like it has just a little too much baggage to work efficiently - but flawed as it is, it is still worth a look.",1214697600,,2219,4.392682926829268
2724021,3,B000M4RG4C,"This film had both strengths and weaknesses but a few of the weaknesses kept the film from being a great production. The film is about the nature of heroism. It explores the question of what makes a hero, why do we need heroes, what happens to heroes?  To some degree it also explores the concept of the fatal flaw of the hero, a classic theme in literature.

The story is about the battle for Iwo Jima and the famous photograph taken February 23, 1945 of 5 Marines and 1 Navy medic raising the US flag on Mt. Suribachi. This famous photograph by Joe Rosenthal became iconic and was a symbol for US victory. The narrative is around 3 of the surviving 6 men who are recruited to be heroes for the American public and to focus on sale of war bonds to further finance the war.

The transport of the troops to Iwa Jima and the battle scenes are the strongest part of the film. If the entire film had been about the full battle for Iwa Jima, it would probably have been a winner, based on the excellent portion of this film that focused on actual warfare. The advance of US troops from the beaches into the mountains and the determined struggle of the Japanese soldiers was excellent film-making. The terrible casualties were very realistically filmed and captured the horror of warfare. This third of the total film deserves 5 stars and is the strongest part of the entire film.

The film however explores the fate of 3 of the surviving men as they are pulled away from the war to become celebrity heroes and to sell war bonds. Here the film explores the fickle nature of idolatry and celebrity. Here we see the 3 servicemen treated in much the same way as the photograph. The public is interested in the surface, the image, and not in the nitty gritty details of reality.

Adam Beach, Ryan Phillippe, and Jesse Bradford play the 3 lead characters. Unfortunately the script does not allow them to become fully characterized and realistic to the audience. Adam Beach tries the hardest, as a Native American man who struggles against the lack of authenticity in the hero production business while comparing this falseness to the tragedy and loss that he and his friends experienced during the battle. He also struggles against a barrage of stereotypical racist impressions and encounters while also struggling with emerging alcoholism. He is the most fully articulated character in the film and Beach tries hard. Ryan Phillippe, who plays the Navy medic, plays more of the Everyman role, the average American middle-class male who absorbs everything around him but keeps the trauma internal until late in his life as a senior citizen his post-traumatic stress disorder emerges in nightmares and flashbacks. Jesse Bradford is meant to play an opportunist who gradually grows on the audience as his humanity begins to slowly emerge. His engagement to his home town girlfriend becomes a focus for the press. These three men manage celebrity in very different ways. The Native American has difficulty coping with the hypocrisy and glitz when he is feeling grief and loss. The Navy medic internalizes and copes outwardly, making compromises and rising to the occasion for what he sees as a greater good. We are not fully aware of Jesse Bradford's internal state. He seems to enjoy the celebrity and play the role for the cameras, but his internal response is never really explored.

The greatest weakness of the film however is the constant flashbacks and flash forwards between the war scenes, the scenes where the 3 fellows are made into heroes, the adaptations these men make after the war, and the final recollections of aged soldiers. These four time frames were shuffled together like a deck of cards and totally deconstructed the film for the viewers. A more basic narrative flow would have served the story much better.",1214697600,,3816,4.783004552352049
2724022,4,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags of Our Fathers' is a thought provoking historical film.  It consists of two basic segments, scenes of the battle for Iwo Jima and the story of the War Bond Tour on which the survivors were sent.

The battle scenes are excellent.  They skillfully depict the horrors which must be war.  The Bond Tour segments tell a different story about how the ""heroes"" were treated by others and how they viewed themselves.

This movie is thought provoking in that it makes the viewer consider the nature and happenstance of ""heroism"" and its fleeting nature.  The heroes did not consider themselves to be heroic and their post war lives were determined by their post-war actions, not their status as ""heroes.""  In a sense, all on Iwo Jima were the heroes and a few were sent on tour.  A movie that leaves one thinking is a worthwhile watch.",1214265600,,833,4.657534246575342

This film is not really about war but is a study of human frailty and what can happen when faced with something horrible and ugly such as battle. Many reviewers missed the boat on this film because they were looking for a lot of action and didn't see what was really before them. Some said it was too long and slow and yes it is a longer than average film but in no way did I find it slow and plodding. Some didn't like Clint Eastwoods attention to detail or the fact that there was a lot of back and forth between the present and past but this was needed to fully expose what these tree young men were going through mentally. At least one reviewer disliked the idea of the "" drunkin indian "". Ira Hayes didn't become an alcoholic because he was native american, he turned to booze because he couldn't deal with the horrors of what he had to see and do during that war and because he hated being called a hero. Many soldiers turned to alcohol during the war, men of all ethnic groups. Several reviewers compared this film to Saving Private Ryan, big mistake. These films are completely different. This one is designed to make you stop and think about how these three men dealt with the after affects of war.

The stories of the kids in these battles are incredible, and they may be reluctant heroes, and maynot be heroes in any sense of the word, but they are ordinary people driven to extraordinary actions.
As a movie, this book does pander a little to political correctness, and suffers for it.  The brutality of the Japanese, their instigation of the war, and the horrifying mutilation of Americans, including Iggy, are glossed over.  The author's naive remarks to his father about how the Japanese were just plain folk and naively driven to the war by their leaders and the father's reaction, of course, are left out of the movie.  And Ira Hayes, a true tragic hero, is rendered well, but the clear subtext of the movie is the nascent racism he faced.

2724030,5,B000M4RG4C,"As a history major, I chose to write my senior thesis on the film Flags of Our Fathers. After conducting weeks of research, I found the film to be extremely consistent with the historical sources. However, the way Clint Eastwood has presented the events of Iwo Jima and the The Mighty Seventh Bond Tour go much further than simply visualizing source material. Eastwood presents an interesting perspective on World War II that breaks away from Brokaw's Greatest Genereation and almost completely avoids ""Spielbergization."" Instead, he has created a masterpiece that argues for a new paradigm of World War II. Through the eyes of the three surviving flag raisers in Joe Rosenthal's famous photo atop Mount Suribachi, Eastwood throws the viewer into the psychological torrent of Iwo Jima and its after-effects. While much of World War II has been propagandized as the Good War, Eastwood shows us that, like any war, they are horrific, traumatic, excessively violent, and life-consuming.",1211068800,,983,5.227848101265823

During world war 2, one of the bloodiest battles took place in Japan on Iwo Jima. This movie tells the TRUE story about the raisers of our nations flag on mount surabachi. They over took the beach on Iwo Jima, and fought their way to mount surabachi where they raised the U.S flag as a sign of partial victory. What i am saying is, this movie tells of what our soldiers do and have done in order to keep our great nation free. This movie is the only movie in year that has told of actual TRUE events on the frontlines- and it saddens me so see a country that cant even recodnize the soldiers WHO FIGHT SO THAT EVERY CITIZEN DOESNT HAVE TO.

2724032,1,B000M4RG4C,"If you are looking for a movie about the tremendous sacrifice made by American servicemen in WWII who fought and died to preserve our freedom, forget this piece of revisionist, left-wing hollywood trash. (Fortunately, the copy I viewed was checked out at my local library, so I did not contribute to the wealth of Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg by buying it.) The battle scenes are very few and interspersed throughout the movie as flashbacks of memories of the main characters, the men who raised the US flag on Mt. Surabachi, or was it the second flag raised on Mt. Surabachi...whatever. As the movie slowly plods along, it tries to make a huge controversy over the men who were viewed as national heroes in an effort to sell bonds to support the war effort. My dad was a WWII veteran of the battle at Iwo Jima, and like most verterans, he rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, and he too would shun the title of ""hero."" But the fact is, ALL of these American servicemen who put their lives on the line are our heros of our free country today; ALL who were in harm's way ran the risk of not returning alive. Yes, even though the men themselves shun the term, they were all heros to a proud nation. But the hollywood lefties just can't stomach that, or take any pride in the sacrifice these men made. The film is so wrong on so many accounts, such as when it says ""a photograph can win or lose a war."" Bull...t!! The men who fight the war win the war! Another lie Eastwood & Spielberg would have us believe is that troops in the field are only willing to die for each other, their buddies. But from what veterans have told me firsthand, they knew they were fighting for a whole lot more, and were always cognizant that they were not only fighting for their buddies, but also their families, their homes, and yes, dare I say it, the country they loved. Of course, since hollywood lefties hate America, this is a point they dare not show in their revisionist propoganda films, and that is exactly what this film is.

2724033,5,B000M4RG4C,"Of the 6 men shown raising the flag in Joe Rosenthal's famous photogtraph, PFC Ira Hayes is the Marine at the very rear. At the end of the Iwo Jima campaign, he, Navy corpsman John ""Doc"" Bradley and PFC Rene Gagnon were the only survivors of the men who raised Old Glory on Suribachi. We know the story; that picture was so compelling that the government whisked away the survivors and sent them cross-country on a bond-tour, being hailed as heroes from one coast to the other. The goal of the drive was to raise $14 billion or else the USA would run out of money. This particular drive raised over $20 billion and it was largely due to the dog-and-pony show these three men were constantly subjected to. These men were exploited as heroes, a label that none were comfortable with. How could they be heroes with all the dead and maimed that resulted from the carnage of Iwo Jima ?

With much the same effectiveness as he showed with the companion film ""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" Director Clint Eastwood shows the very human struggles or otherwise ordinary people who answered their nation's call without any quest for glory or reward.

I vote yes, his performance as Ira Hayes is indelibly seared into my brain pan now, and he doesn't even have that much screen time.  In fact Adam Beach's performance is bigger than the movie and maybe that's a bad thing, but look at La Vie En Rose, in which Marion Cotillard is giving a fantastic performance in a bad movie and she still managed to snag that Oscar.

Anyhow Beach is sublime and almost makes me interested enough in the ""real Ira Hayes"" to read a biography of him.  His life seems tragic, the way everyone calls him ""Chief"" and then makes a mockery of his human rights with the next breath.  The sergeant summons him, ""Get your red assright over here, Hayes!"" an expression I've never heard before but maybe native Americans get this sort of abuse every day.  After the war is over he has one job, to sell war bonds by appearing at mass rallies, and eventually his love if alcohol burns him out completely, that and the memory of seeing too many ghastly things on that faraway Pacific island.  Eastwood photographs him as though he were Christ at Calvary, stumbling around towards other, divine place beyond this earth.

We laughed though to see Tom McCarthy as the narrator, the journalist putting together the big inside story of Iwo Jima, when now we see the same actor on THE WIRE as Scott Templeton, the lazy journalist without scruples who just makes up his sources willy-nilly; if he can't find a great quote he just makes it up and ascribes it to an imaginary figure.

After about 25 minutes Eastwood stopped telling about the battle & started telling about the bond drive by 3 men who raised the flag.  After this the battle scenes were basically flashbacks about how the men who raised the flag were killed at Iwo.

2724037,3,B000M4RG4C,"Overall one of the best films about the war in the Pacific since TORA,TORA,TORA.  Loosely based on the James Bradley book of the same name, Clint Eastwood's direction rescues the Pacific War genre from more recent failed attempts such as THE THIN RED LINE and WINDTALKERS.

The film primarily concentrates on the lives of the three surviving second flag raisers on Mount Suribachi.  The famous photograph was the second of two flags raised on the collapsed volcanic rim on Iwo Jima with the names of the first flag raisers almost virtually forgotten except for history books.  The movie does a great job in clearly resolving the lore regarding the two flags.

Great CGI effects of the US fleet pounding the basalt and sulpherous island. The island assault sequences were lensed in the same style as PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS with washed out color and a lot of hand held camera activity.

As for opportunities this film becomes annoying with constant flashbacks and flash-forwards from the embattled volcanic isle.  Flashbacks worked well at the beginning and conclusion of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but it is a distraction in FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS.  Unlike the companion film, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, which is more or less a sequential story with occasional flahsbacks, FLAGS is chock full of them.  The best continuous sequence of the film is the IWO landing sequence and struggle to move inland.

Despite the well depicted story of two Marines and Navy Corpsman struggling through the war bond tour, the whole post Iwo drama pales in comparison to the action on island.  No doubt the island combat flashbacks were inserted to maintain the intensity of the film.  Quite frankly I would have enjoyed a whole film revolving around these characters and their experiences on Iwo Jima alone.  Much as I did actually enjoy this movie and LETTERS, there is a signficant opportunity to create yet a third hybrid version of the Iwo battle combining the best elements of both stand-alone movies.

Eastwood captured the look and mood of 1945 America and the bond tour.  The only aspect that is overplayed is that of the United States being almost bankrupt and the heavy sales burden placed on the returning heroes.  These guys are wined and dined across the United States and forced into roles they never asked for.  Toward the end of the film one cannot help but feel sorry for the well known story of poor Ira Hayes and his inability to adjust to his celebrity status and ultimate decline.

FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a very good movie, but loses some of its power on a small television screen.  In the movies theater I was impressed by the end credits and the ominous end title music with actual photos of the Iwo Jima struggle projected alongside the film's credits.  I could not bring myself to leave the theater until the credits concluded. FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is another film where theater audience exited in total silence during the end credits.

Eastwood filmed in a variety of locations.  The production crew did an outstanding job filming many of the Iwo Jima scene in Iceland.  The Icelandic beaches and inshore volcanic terrain are very similar to the basaltic and tuffa volcanic isle.",1204416000,,3187,4.828729281767956

2724039,5,B000M4RG4C,"Clint Eastwood, in my eyes will forever be considered the greatest contributor to American Cinema and this is one of the reasons why. He is not only a great actor but he is a spectacular Director, of course not forgetting Million Dollar Baby & The Unforgiven are just 2 movies that he can add his name to which will forever cement his prestigious image.

Flags of our Fathers tells the true story of 6 soldiers who became immortalised by just one picture of the American flag being raised on Mount Suribachi of the Island of Iwo Jima. The battle for Iwo Jima has long been considered one of the biggest battles that the Americans faced during WWII, and this is something that Eastwood displays to us in the epic film. Of the 6 men in the photograph only 3 survived the battle to be brought home and welcolmed as heroes. These men were Ira Hayes (Adam Beach), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillipe).

The photograph became monumental in the eyes of the American people and it quickly became a symbol of hope for a country that was in crippling debt and seemed to be losing the war. The American people weren't told the truth about the flag raising, the raising itself wasn't the first. There was a flag raised before the one in the photograph but was ordered to be taken down and replaced as it was seen as too small to be seen from nearby landing beaches. Because of this picture the 3 living soldiers gained a new found celebrity and they each handled it in their own particular way. Hayes was lead on from the start and simply kept his opinions and dreads to himself, while drinking away his sorrows. Gagnon simply enjoyed the new found fame and took it in his stride, and even to some extent tried to prolonge his celebrity image. Bradley simply voiced his opinions and had a sense of guilt that he shouldn't allow the soldiers who raised the original flag to be forgotten. He simply had to obey the orders of his superiors and continue with the farce that they were the first men to take Mount Suribachi and they were the first to raise the American Flag.

I adored this film but as much as it pains me to say it, it does have its flaws which as an objective reviewer I have to address. The battle scenes are simply first class and something as to which Eastwood truly excels himself as they are something beyond epic. The alternate scenes however which place the 3 main soldiers at home handling their own particular troubles seem a bit too try hard and that, I felt took a lot away from a film that had so much potential. An example of it being a bit too try hard was how Eastwood portrayed Hayes becoming the depressed drunk. Although this may have been a true representation, I felt Eastwood was simply trying to make us cry and that is something that shouldn't be forced upon people. Good character direction and true character representation is something that can make us feel sad for a persons downfall, however people can also pick up on something that simply seemed to be trying to make us sad.

Although it had its flaws this was still a very entertaining and epic film that I found to be quite enjoyable. This also has a good edge to it with the alternative film Letters from Iwo Jima which tells the Japanese side of the story also Directed by Eastwood. Letters from Iwo Jima is certainly the better of the two but Flags of our Fathers is still a very good film in its own right.

I would recommend this to any film lover as even with its flaws it has something to offer everybody.",1202515200,,3526,4.443585780525503
2724040,4,B000M4RG4C,"Flags of Our Fathers, and it's companion film, Letters From Iwo Jima, are two of the best World War II movies I have ever seen.  These two films need to be seen back to back.  They both clearly show how nasty war is, bringing the human faces of war to you in a manner too hard to ignore. And what makes them stand out from the rest, is that not only is the war seen from the very real human side of the tale, but even more importantly, from both sides of the conflict.  Watch Flags of Our Fathers first and Letters from Iwo Jima second.  Clint Eastwood directs both.  Flags of Our Fathers was developed from the nonfiction best seller that James Bradley wrote about his father, John ""Doc"" Bradley, the last survivor among the six soldiers who raised the flag on Iwo Jima.  The politics and real story behind this very famous photo and statue are fascinating, and disturbing.

2724041,3,B000M4RG4C,"I think it's very difficult to create this sort of film, based on such charged material in a timeframe when the public was blind to the machinations of the man behind the curtain.  Based on the book of the same name, in an effort to raise funds for the war, the government conscripts the aid of three soldiers who were photographed raising the flag on Iwo Jima to tour the nation and use their experiences as propaganda to bolster the public view of the government.  Aside from the personal conflicts the soldiers have at being used thusly, they experience moral conflicts regarding the way in which the flag actually was raised.  The names and details included did not reflect the event accurately, and the soldiers were forbidden to let this fallacy be known.  Narrated by one of the surviving soldiers to the son of another survivor, the film tells the story of these men and that of the men who died at Iwo Jima.

Common to the many war genre films that have saturated the market the last few years, this film delves into the brutal realities of war, the effects it has on soldiers, and the political agendas driving mass death.  In this regard it is not terribly original, but carries the torch in raising the awareness that win or lose, war takes a terrible toll on all involved.  The film is rather graphic in some scenes.  One of its more original angles, however, are its intense examinations of the treatment of Native Americans in the military at that time.  Adam Beach stole the film for his portrayal of Ira Hayes, the Pima man who finally spoke the truth of raising the flag.

While I feel that Eastwood directed a great film, the editing in it was quite choppy.  I enjoy nonsequential revelation as much as anyone, but the transitions were quite rough and in the end the storytelling suffered for it.  The acting was superb, the cast conveyed wonderful chemistry.  This film's success lies in its honest delivery of the message that society creates heroes of people who just want peace.",1201478400,,2001,4.63456090651558
2724042,2,B000M4RG4C,"This movie is pretty much a ""Saving Private Ryan"" wannabe that falls flat. ""Ryan"" was a great movie, this one's a flop, and most of the things it wants to say were already said with megawatts more power in ""Ryan."" The battle scenes are uninteresting. There are few successful scenes that put us right there in the terror of battle that other recent war films like ""Ryan"" have accomplished. Where's those shots that become emblazoned on the memory like the landing craft door falling open and the GI's in front getting instantaneously mowed down like rag dolls by German machine gun fire, the guy searching for, and finding, his severed arm in the waters of Normandy beach, and the three medics bizarrely working on one practically dead guy while surrounded by thousands of dying and wounded? ""Flags,"" in comparison, is unimpressively timid and uncreative in its visual imaging. Do I unfairly compare this movie to ""Ryan?"" Art is partly appraised by the level of art that comes before it. This film doesn't view as a successor to the groundbreaking accomplishments of ""Ryan."" It's more of a John Wayne film without John Wayne and with characters and scenes that mostly border on war movie stereotype with dialogue that is very forgettable. As for the battle of Iwo Jima, we get no sense of the strategies of the battle or how things progressed.

When it switches to the returned-home scenes the movie just becomes either boring or painful to watch. I've seen all this kind of stuff before. Give us something new to mull over. Push it harder. ""They were the heroes, not me."" Come on. What does that really mean? How about, instead of just the cliche, we get something profound that reflects the background awesomeness of the situation. I don't just want to see the Indian (the film's term) end up in the ditch with only that cliche on his lips. Pathetic is not valid or interesting here. Another example, how and why does a man end up dying, not with thoughts of his loving wife of fifty years, nor his loving grown children who are by his side, but with thoughts about someone he briefly knew in a wartime situation fifty years earlier? Was that the sum of his existence? Sorry, that scene came off corny to me. Young men frolicking. Is that supposed to move me? Give me something powerful. Wrench my gut, Clint, like ""Ryan"" did with ""earn it, earn it."" Boys will be boys, in life and death, is not much of an alternative.

The other thing that ""Ryan"" did with great success--which all post-Vietnam films are morally required to do--is get that question, ""was it all worth it?"" mounted on the screen somewhere. All that death, destruction, maiming, torture, and insanity on Iwo Jima may have been for naught. The history books about the invasion are full of that theme. It's nowhere in this film. The island apparently had little strategic importance. Come on, Clint. Where's that in your film? It would be an appropriate topic to include considering the present situation of the U.S. armed forces. We want to honor, at least, the commitment and bravery of our armed forces. Honor them by getting to the real conflicts of the human soul and the powers that influence and control it, and maybe thereby, to the amazing phenomenons of duty and self-sacrifice, or lack thereof.

Everything about the film was about as well-written as a war story can possibly be.  Going into the movie, I personally didn't know much about the Iwo Jima flag raising moment.  I knew it took place obviously, but I didn't know how much of a story could be told from that alone.  Trust me, there's a lot about that flag that really surprised me, and I was left feeling like I learned a lot about the war and this particular moment in time.

I'd say you could compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan in terms of war realism and phenomenal acting abilities from the characters who portrayed the soldiers.  It wasn't as violent compared to the Tom Hanks film (or as frequent) but Flags Of Our Fathers really showed you what it was like to be a soldier with feelings.  The soldiers in the film weren't portrayed as just mindless shooting robots.  Nope, while watching the movie you got to know these guys and their families.  It wasn't just shooting and war scenes throughout the film.

I also never gave much thought to what must be going through the mind of a soldier while fighting a war.  They aren't just there to fight for our country, but they're also out there fighting for each other, and saving their friends during horrible and violent moments.  That's something I really never thought about before watching this movie.  I think it's a fantastic movie and deserves all the attention and awards it has received.

The iconic image we all have of the flag being raised is actually not the original moment. That was done in a less cerimonious way earlier with a different flag & a different cast of characters. The military didn't care. They wanted heroes for the home front to consume. The result was somebody getting credit & somebody being forgotten to history. Most people didn't know all this including the p.r. flaks who were ramrodding the the whole thing. The Marines that may have been aware didn't care or were already dead. The flag raisings (both of them) were done very early in the meat grinder that Iwo Jima was to become. The fighting for the island went on for weeks after. Several of the participants in one or the other were ordered unwillingly back to the states for the celebrations. The movie is a bit disorganized with action flashing back & forth from the island to the home front. Not Eastwood's best effort. Too much time spent on the problems of drunken Marine, Ira Hayes suffering from guilt & stupid remarks such as the U.S. running out of money to continue the war. Really?

Relationships in war difficult to maintain after war.  No support network, results in continuing problems, now called PTSD, among other things.  I find something very disturbing, though--no space allowed for balance--the constant emphasis on depression even dampens humor, which is always present during times like these (especially war); its absence is a glaring flaw.  Some will think this 'normal'; not exactly!  Necessity not explained, only expediency.  A mercenary aspect is emphasized, which, although, present, is skewed too much in its emphasis.

The historical tale of the behind the scenes machinations both in the flying of the American flag on Mount Suribachi and in the marketing first of the image and later of its titular participants was interesting and also slightly sad because it was cruelly disillusioning. As for what else was wrong with this movie...I felt throughout that what I was seeing was something like a one point presentation padded out and masquerading as a war film. I know Flags of Our Fathers is factual and on the part of many people a labor of love, but it is also not a great film, and I say this for a number of reasons.

2724056,4,B000M4RG4C,"I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood as a director.  In my opinion, he is second only to Woody Allen as the best active American director.  I had planned on viewing ""Flags of Our Fathers"" at the movie theater but it was only there one week.  I started reading some rather negative reviews and wondered if the problem was with the reviewers.  I finally rented the video last night and I must admit that my first impressions were mixed.

The main problem that I had with ""Flags of Our Fathers"" was the frequent time shifts both forward and backward.  This is becoming a more common techique, I'm finding.  Usually it works (otherwise, why would a director utilize if if he didn't have a purpose in mind?).  However, sometimes it doesn't and the audience is left unintentionally confused or out of the loop.  I was not confused by this technique in FOOF but I did feel out of the loop.

This is a story that works along the lines of the classic Western ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  We look at reality through the eyes of how it occurred and how it was perceived.  In TMWSLV we have the great line, ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"".  That was essentially what the protagonists were suggesting in FOOF and, although the reasons varied, the characters were still pawns in something bigger that they were.  In ""Flags of Our Fathers"" the message was essentially spelled out in the closing monologue and the gist of it was there were no heros; just common men placed in uncommon situations who, through luck and pluck, realized different outcomes.

The famous flag waving on top of Mt Suribachi is something we're all familiar with.  The movie asks us to examine the picture and its' patriotic meaning in our common heritage and to review reality and perception.  We are led to focus on the reality (although there are several times when the charlatans in the movie make their case for ""perception"" with eloquence).  The three surviving soldiers from the event are wisked back stateside to boost war bond sales to jump-start the failing war economy.  Their intro-spective perception was that they were no heros; just three people in the right place at the right time.  Their main focus were their comrades who died leaving their names meaningless in comparison.  That's where I realize the time shifts failed; the lack of character development up to that point in the movie left me knowing way more about the three main characters and wondering just who the other three were.  This may have been intentional but it wasn't helpful.  Eventually we are reunited back in time and follow what happened to the other three; soldiers we realize we'd met earlier but to whom we weren't properly introduced.

The movie closes strong and that altered my impression initially but the misunderstanding along the way I blame more on the director than myself.  I was also bothered by my perception that the writer and director gave us just the information we needed to come to the same conclusion that they did which, to me, was the same method and purpose of the big shot publicity people in the movie.  In the end, it is the individual soldier who has had to make it through all of this and make his own peace with the past; that was the aspect of ""Flag of Our Fathers"" that I liked the best.",1189900800,,3290,4.629310344827586
2724057,1,B000M4RG4C,"What is the point of this movie . . that American Indians have an alcohol problem, or that the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima was somehow a show, with meaning only for the publicists at that time.  That a flag was raised twice is fine, and that there was some confusion over who was actually in the picture is also credible.  But harping on one of the soldiers sour disposition, and his drinking problem just didn't seem to belong.  And the insistence that the USA would run out of money unless the surviving soldiers put on shows across the country to help raise funds didn't seem appropriate  either.  Of all the problems we were faced with during the Good War, the inability for the Government to print money when required was not one of them.

This movie tried to sensationalize a very somber event, representing a major triumph of US forces over the Japanese.  It shouldn't have. The raising of the flag should be an event best left to history.",1189468800,,950,4.488372093023256

2724072,5,B000M4RG4C,"This collaboration between Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg is historically accurate and is dramatically pungent leaving the audience with only a glimpse of what it was like defending their country from the enemy in the 1940s.

Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Spielberg were successfully able to bring the borders of Dramatic Screen Play and Accurate Historical Documentation together in this biographical story of John Bradley, Pharm2c, U.S. Navy, as told by his son, James Bradley.

People who have never been in combat will miss much of the story the first viewing as well as the majority of subtle military nuances which combines as a vast list of variables producing the Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders demonstrated and seen in the personalities of the four Marines and one US Navy Hospital Corpsman who were the second team to raise the American flag on Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima.

For combat veterans from America's beginning to the present, nothing has been available for the regular public to view which enables public understanding of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD). This film may be the start.

Currently, over 95% of combat veterans returning from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have CPTSD, but our country and the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to practice denial of how serious, debilitating and lethal CPTSD is to the returning service members, their families, and friends.

This movie, whether there was a deliberate intent to introduce the public to the lethality of CPTSD or not, does this task with flying colors.

My heartfelt congratulations and thanks go to you Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Spielberg for producing a vehicle for understanding for those who can and want to know and appreciate the plight of the American Warrior.

The only problem now is getting the money-grabbing and uncaring politicians to watch the movie, comprehend, and realize that they have an obligation as elected officials to thousand of walking wounded coming back to the U.S. from war-torn Iraq and Afghanistan, inflicted with a deadly disorder and injury called Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

If we as a country expect to survive past this generation, we need to EFFECTIVELY treat CPTSD in all aspects of the lives of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guard's men, with compassion remembering they placed their lives in harm's way for the people of their country, or there will not be an American nation for very long...

Even the war scenes, impressively framed, do not shed light on what was really going on - instead go for gore and shock.  Eastwood should have spent more time on the war and less on the bond tour.

Certainly, the few amazing battle scenes are brilliantly staged, but the film is more about the survivors and their ""forced"" celebrity, as well as a comment on cameraderie in time of war. Unlike other reviewers who were disappointed with the lack of characterization, I had no problem empathizing with the various characters and their very different life stories. Ryan Phillippe and Jesse Bradford were quite fine, and Adam Beach really steals every scene as Ira Hayes,  the most conflicted of the bunch.

2724077,4,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags of Our Fathers"" follows the lives of the men who raised the flag in the famous photograph at Iwo Jima during WWII.

This is not the action packed war movie you might expect, but rather a multilayered exploration of heroism.

The irony of the film is that the three survivors of the flag-raising were not particularly heroic despite being promoted as such - it turns out they were not even the first ones to raise the flag on Mt Suribachi - and yet many of the unheralded soldiers in arms they left behind did perform heroic deeds.

Eastwood is more at home with this subject matter than the ""other"" Iwo Jima movie he filmed at the same time ""Letters from Iwo Jima"".",1184889600,,672,4.4471544715447155
2724078,5,B000M4RG4C,"In this epic film about the Battle of Iwo Jima, director Clint Eastwood triangulates three different viewpoints about the war. First are the soldiers themselves, normal human beings who resist the notion of being labeled ""heroes"" and who, in contrast to war sloganeers, know what combat means. These men are bravery and loyalty personified. Then, there is the vantage point of real war in all its vulgarity, degradation, terror, violence, and dehumanization. 70,000 Americans stormed the island and some 6,8000 died. 22,000 Japanese defended their land and 20,000 of them died. Finally, there is the government propaganda machine back home that must manipulate public opinion to send its sons into that meat grinder. Almost every American will recognize the iconic photograph of the six soldiers raising the flag on top of the tiny island of Iwo Jima (by Joe Rosenthal). But very few Americans know the reality behind the image. Eastwood shows how the government manipulated the image, distorted the historical facts, exploited the unwitting soldiers who raised the flag (forced fund raising tours back home), and turned a mundane moment of wartime into a propagandistic farce. The film is based upon the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers, which tells the real story about the flag-raising (Bradley's father was the last survivor of the six soldiers). Eastwood's sequel, Letters from Iwo Jima, tells the story of this battle from the viewpoint of the Japanese.",1184716800,,1463,5.203389830508475

2724080,1,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags of Our Fathers"" is a globdiferous film of twisted storytelling and bent logics.  The essential objection that I would raise against it is its negativism.  From  professional reviews all the way through the amateur reviews,  it is generally conceded that the film adopts a cynical view of heroism.

  It may be nothing more than the Director's fiat,  but  it is sufficient as a theme to find resonance in a host of equally negativistic reviewers who wish to deny the sacrifices of  the Marine and Navy personnel who fought the battle,  and find some obscure angle from which to hold forth authoritatively  and show delight in heaping their scorn and contempt upon those who sacrificed for their fellow combatants and their nation.

  Thus far,  not a single claim that this film reveals some kind of a TRUTH has been substantiated, and I believe I've challenged each and every reviewer who made that ridiculous claim.

  Yet another common contradiction which appears in reviews is that it is suggested that the Marine and Navy personnel  engaged in the bond drive were suffering variously from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  or Combat Fatigue,  alcoholism,  and all other manner of diagnosis grounded in the nature of their combat experience.  What is peculiar in this regard is that many reviewers still engage in polemics supporting the film's  characterization of these men as something other than heroes.

Can you see that?  They were in combat,  and suffered for it by this characterization,  but because the film generates such a negative view of these men,  the reviewers decide to mimic the film's negativism to deny that these men were heroes or heroic at all;  but the same reviewers will claim that the men suffered as a result of their experiences in combat. This contradiction permits the reviewer to argue both ways at once.

  The logical dialogue might go like this:

 Did the men endure horrific combat?  Yes.
 Did the horrific combat induce stress and other maladies?  Yes
 Were the men heroes?  NO.
 Why weren't the men heroes?  Well,  because  they weren't the original men who raised the flag.
 So only the original men who raised the flag were heroes and no other men fighting on the island could be characterized as heroic?  Yes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  There is another issue which comes into play in considering whether this film is respectful of the men who fought in the battle for Iwo Jima. Although it may not be apparent at first.  The film and those whose reviews endorse the film, claim that the film abolishes MYTHS regarding heroes and heroism.  This is a continuation of the film's negativistic suggestibility.

  I would like to indicate that the film industry itself is accountable for the popularization of certain MYTHS concerning heroes and heroism.  Film  like ""RAMBO"" and even  Eastwood's  portrayal of Sgt. Tom Highway in ""HEARTBREAK RIDGE""  convey an image of the American military that is largely MYTHOLOGICAL, and it capitalizes on this for purposes of profit.

  Afterward,  ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is credited with destroying  the MYTH of the American  heroes  fighting on Iwo Jima,  including the American heroes who served on  the bond drive.

  Also,  the film never does make it explicit whether the Marine and Navy personnel either  WERE  or  WERE NOT  heroes.  The film creates a confusing scenario of flashbacks  which confuses the chronology and the viewers perception of events.  By this standard, interestingly enough,  one could call into question whether the film is a great film.

  The film also confuses FACT & MYTH  by  the shifting and some of the worst stereotyping of characters  as has ever been presented in films.  Several characters serve in this negative stereotyping.

(1) the businessman on the train offering  post-war jobs

(2) the manager of the bond drive, who is so easily targeted for public contempt

(3)  the tourists approaching Ira Hayes in the farm field to snap a photograph.

  This is merely cunning film-makiing, not brilliant film making.  There really isn't that much of a distinction between obvious propaganda  and ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" the film is so manipulative that it becomes itself,  a form of the very type of propaganda effort it purports to expose and condemn.

  Finally,  I would like to fault the film for the simple fact that it just isn't  fun.  As a purchase,  I'm very disappointed  with it for its broken storytelling and  its flashbacks.

  I find justification for comparisons between ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and other films.  For example,  it is clear that ""Saving Private Ryan"" was an attempt to show great respect for the  ""citizen soldiers"" who participated in the Normandy landings on D-Day, 6 June 1944 and afterward.  It showed very carefully,  what the men were, and what they did.

  In direct contrast,  ""Flags of Our Fathers"" shows many characters as different from what we have historically accepted them to be.  The negative stereotyping, the confusing  handling of the subject of Heroes and Heroics  leaves the viewer with a hollow empty feeling, a cynicism about the self-sacrifice of many American families whose sons never returned,  or returned home  with injury.

  You see,  the very nature of heroism, is that it is itself a kind of truth.  It isn't a truth merely because it is portrayed in some movie or book, or even with a medal.  The men who sacrifice,  whether it was Marines in Korea on Pork Chop Hill, or at the Chosin Reservoir, or in South Vietnam,  or the Army personnel landing on Normandy on D-Day,  or even an American Infantryman fighting at Concord Massachussets during the American Revolution.  Self-sacrifice and the shedding of blood  is honored in the hearts of those those who saw it as their duty to give of their life to the uttermost, and in the hearts of those who were there to witness.

  I am deeply offended in this film. Those men gave all so that Americans would remain free, to enjoy life, to write books and make movies.  I just don't think they made the sacrifice in expectation that their own people would turn and and depict them as hypocrits and villains and phonies and liars.

  ***[They've actually been called all of these in various reviews of this movie on Amazon.  Look at that;  HYPOCRITS,  VILLAINS,  PHONIES, and LIARS]***

Furthermore,  to present these men as  ""victims"" of prejudices,  as though the world had to be perfect before  the men made their sacrifices, is also absurd. You see, that is the nature of the genuine hero. He doesn't sacrifice only because the world is perfect and free of prejudice. The Hero sacrifices himself so that the world can become perfect.

 Those who expect that the world  must be perfect,  before  giving of themselves or performing a sacrifice,  are not actually living.  It was Confucius, I believe,  who indicated that those who fear death,  die a thousand times.  --Semper Fidelis,  Bruce Bain",1184284800,,6974,4.954545454545454
2724081,1,B000M4RG4C,"With Clint Eastwood as director and Steven Spielberg as producer I was really expecting to watch a movie that would be on par with Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, I was severely disappointed!

Let me start by saying that I have the utmost respect for those that fought on the Battle if Iwo Jima, I can't imagine the real horror it must have been to be there.

In telling the story of the ""flag"", which was probably very accurate I felt that the movie was very disjointed in its bounces between timeframes.  From the battle to the fund raising events, back and forth, back and forth I was not able to enjoy any continuity in the story.  Just when I was starting to bite my nails in a combat scene it would jump into some stadium full of people and a reenactment of the flag raising.  I would slump in my seat and wonder why I had let the tension build up inside only to be let down like this.

Watching a drunken American Indian rant and rave throughout the movie was most disappointing.  While that may have been the fact, I didn't find the portrayal anything but depressing, which in many ways was the way that I left the theater, depressed, wondering in whose pocket my $10 would land.

I'm guessing if you read the book and saw the movie you might be very happy with the performance. My expectations far outweighed this movies ability to deliver any type of gripping story, fulfilling battle scenes (as both director and producer have delivered in the past) or feeling that at the end I was a better person for having watched such a sad reel of film.",1183939200,,1563,4.402777777777778

It may be something that we have to participate in because of circumstances, but I think the message is that it isn't a simple solution and the price is high.  The film does suffer from lack of good characters which is surprising for an Eastwood film.  I liked the battle scenes and thought they were well done.  Overall Saving Ryan was better in some respects, but then it suffered from the contrivance of the German soldier killing the American soldier after he was let go. So yes the film is flawed but still worthwhile.",1183248000,,652,4.6347826086956525

2724086,4,B000M4RG4C,"The Movie Itself is one part of a pair of films done by legendary actor/director Clint Eastwood about the battle at Iwo Jima in World War II. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is one of two films that Clint did about the battle from both side's perspectives. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" (this movie's counter-part) tells the Japanese perspective. While this film tells the American perspective I guess you could say, it's primarily about a real life photo that can be found on the cover of this release. The picture is a very patriotic photograph that shows six soldiers raising the American flag after the battle at Iwo Jima. This picture starts a lot of media coverage and hype labeling the three surviving soldiers ""war heroes."" This film follows the lives during and after that battle of those three remaining soldiers, John ""Doc"" Bradley (played by Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (played by Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (played by Adam Beach). I'd like to point out that this film is based on true events and the names of the soldiers are real. In fact the original book ""Flags of Our Fathers"" was written by James Bradley (son of John ""Doc"" Bradley). This film was also produced by Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg.

These three soldiers are brought home labeled as ""war heroes"" as stated above and soon being used by the U.S. government to help sell war bonds to help the war effort. Which they do accomplish but at the same time there's a lot of demons inside these men that came from seeing such a horrific battle at Iwo Jima. This is especially true for both John Bradley and Ira Hayes who throughout the film have post-war stress induced flashbacks that really got to them on a really emotional level that they can't talk about with anyone or even come to terms with themselves. This movie is not one that glorifies war but instead one that shows the hell that comes with it. So if you're expecting to see a bunch of Japanese get slaughtered you might wanna look elsewhere and seek therapy. That's not what this movie is about. This movie and what it stands for can really be stated best by a quote by the real John ""Doc"" Bradley, ""The real heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who didn't come back"". I think after watching this film that Clint Eastwood made you'll have a better understanding for that quote.

Video Quality on this release is presented in 1080p VC-1 encoded on a 30gb HD DVD for the feature film. This film visually is up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of amazing visual CG special effects and such. Even though war as it is portrayed in this film is a very ugly and disturbing thing to watch at times, this release in terms of video quality itself really does offer just an amazing transfer with great picture. The blacks are perfect, no artifacts or pixilation to be found in this video presentation. The cinematography style that this film as well as it's counter-part, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" uses might lead some to think the contrast is off but it's just the visual style that Clint Eastwood was going for to show the time period in both films. This release is one of the best in terms of video quality yet from Paramount and I hope it's a sign of things to come.

Audio Quality on this release is the standard Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 @ 1.5Mbps. One thing most important to this sound mix is the fact it's a film about war, World War II at that. So it's kind of expected a movie like this have a great surround mix and I can honestly say it lives up to those expectations very much so. Dialog comes out in obviously the center and front channels as you'd expect in the less intense scenes of the film. When you're in the flashbacks of battle scenes of the film you really notice an awesome surround presence that will make you hear gunfire up close, distant or passing gunfire as well as mortar shells. The surround experience on this release is one that is sure to please any action film fan.

Bonus Materials are included on their very own extra HD DVD and are in High Definition. First off there's ""An Introduction by Clint Eastwood"" (5 minutes), then ""Words on the Page"" (17 minutes) which tells us a bit about the original book written by James Bradley. James is the son of John Bradley (played by Ryan Phillipe in the film). This feature offers interviews with James Bradley (again the book's original author) as well as the screenplay writers William Broyles, Jr. and Paul Haggis. Next is ""Six Brave Men"" (20 minutes) which tells the personal stories of each of the six real life soldiers in the photograph and offers interviews with the actors who portray them in this film. ""The Making of an Epic"" (30 minutes) is your typical making of documentary of a film. It includes interviews with everyone from the producer (Robert Lorenz), director of photography (Tom Stern), special effects coordinator, editor (Joel Cox), art director, costume designer and even the military technical adviser. ""The Making of an Epic"" is really by far the real highlight of the bonus materials for this film and looks amazing in High Def. ""Raising the Flag"" (3 minutes) is a short feature about reenacting the photograph that the film is primarily about in the film just as it was in real life. ""Visual Effects"" (15 minutes) is exactly what the name says, a feature on the visual (""CG"") special effects used on this film. ""Looking into the Past"" (10 minutes) offers up a lot of old historical military video footage of the actual battle at Iwo Jima. History Channel fans will definitely love this while some of the more action film oriented crowd may want to skip this. The last feature included is the original Theatrical Trailer in High Def. This release definitely packs some great bonus materials on it's very own disc and is really impressive.

2724087,1,B000M4RG4C,"I am not sure if anyone else saw this film the same way but I took it as a 90 minute Anti-War film with 15 minutes of battle scenes. Why was there so much time put into having the wrong names of the Marines who raised the flag on the island and the government covering it up? This point seem to be thrown out at you all throughout the film when there was on need for it. It should have been stated to set the record straight and then not brought up again. If they wanted to really honor the Marines they should have focused more on the events that took place during the battle, not the politics of the tour to increase the sale of War Bonds. Also the movie jumped around far too much. The son of one of the Marines who raised the flag was interviewing individuals who were on the island with flashbacks to the tour in the US for War Bonds who had flashbacks of the fighting which took place on the island. Too much time was wasted trying to figure out who was talking to who and at what point in time it was taking place. Someone should have watched ""Saving Private Ryan"" instead of ""Pearl Harbour"" before making this film. We have had enough anti-war talk from Hollywood. When is it going to stop? Don't waste your time with this movie, there are better films out there that honor the men and women who have fought for this country.

While the effort was noble,wrapped in the flag for our veterans, and protected under their halo.  The movie stunk.  It stunk because Clint was trying to make it relevant.  For example the the scene where the publicist for the bond drive rails about lack of money for the war, and the Arabs not giving us enough oil. Huh?  Are we talking WWII or Iraq. Old Clint should check his facts.  He laments that the factories can't produce bullets etc due to a bankrupt economy.  Huh?  WE WERE the worlds economy back then, producing more that all our adversaries AND Allies combined. Our soldiers on Okinawa and in the Phllipines would have been suprised to hear that we were out of bullets since they went on to fight unimpeded for another 6 months till the end of the war. The oilmen of the US, then the worlds largest producer and exporter of oil would have been amused too.  The extent of the reserves in the Middle East were not known until AFTER the war.  The US floated the Allies to victory on a ocean of oil produced in Texas and the mid continent.  Period.  The movie was pure liberal hollywood BS.

Don't get me wrong, I grew up in the military and lived on Okinawa, scene of the same kind of vicious fighting as seen on Iwo, only it lasted three MONTHS.  Eastwood has made a film worth to stand with the likes of Pearl Harbor.  It is filled to the top of a 50 gallon drum with stereotypes and ho hum characters.  If all the Marines in real life were so uninteresting then I wonder why the battle even made the papers.

Only someone totally unfamiliar with the Pacific War, the battle, and the central characters, could believe half of the ""facts"" presented in the movie or sit through it to it's final painful but anti-clamatic ending.

The battle sequences while well done with special effects were totally underwhelming when mutilated by the ""artistic"" back and forth skipping from past to present and back again.

Marines didn't dare get out of their holes at night much less yell at the top of their lungs else they would have been cut to sashimi by Japanese infiltrators.

The sterotypes were horrible.  While Ira was a tragic native american in life succumbing to alcoholism and probable PTSD, the only stereotypical prejudice he didn't endure in the movie was having to stand next to a cigar store indian.  Clint missed out on putting a scene in about the prejudice against Black troops too, who by the way, had been allowed to enlist in the Marines by that time in the war due to shortage of men.

The movie failed on so many levels.  I know that Letters from Iwo Jima will bet cudos over seas, because any movie showing US military men getting wacked plays well.  The same fanaticism and sacrifice for a demi-god displayed by the Japanese is still with us today.  I wonder if Eastwood will make THAT connection in the second part of his epic, or just protray them as tragically misled victims.  Probably the latter.",1181865600,,3130,4.4920353982300885

Doesn't director Clint Eastwood and scripter Paul Haggis realize that we were fighting an enemy that invaded our soil?  I think the makers of this film are confusing the Second World War with subsequent U.S. military entanglements.  News Flash!!!  This was not Vietnam!

2724093,3,B000M4RG4C,"This isn't a bad movie, but I don't think it deserved the Academy Award attention it got. Yes, the Battle of Iwo Jima was one of the bloodiest of WWII, but it's unlikely that all the casualties were as cinematically graphic as shown here - with severed heads blinking their last into the camera.  And it's unlikely that all the shots fired tore through flesh with the impact of video game strikes, as they do here. For a more realistic picture of the haphazard mix of hits and misses, of graphically shocking and banal injury that takes place in real war - you probably can't do better than to check out the 1930 Academy Award winner, ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

Then there's also something extravagantly unrealistic about the motivation in this movie. The men who were credited with raising that iconic flag on Iwo Jima are shown racked by anguish and guilt as they go on their subsequent bond tour. The presumption is that much of their torment stems from the deception they are perpetrating as they allow the heroism and grandeur of that flag-planting to be imputed to them. But it's not clear why that deception should loom so large in their psyches.

One of the men called to make the tour was perhaps not involved in the actual flag-raising and is a stand-in for a deceased soldier who did help raise the flag. However all the touring men were in the thick of the battle and would have reason to take credit for heroism. Then the fact that the original flag-planting was re-staged so that a second set of photos could be taken would seem to be a minor deception at best - hardly enough to justify all the men's self-doubt - certainly not enough to justify the fact that one of the men spiraled down into lifelong alcoholism and unemployment.

So you never really get to know these men. Their emotions seem incoherent and groundless.

A good commentary on the DVD might have filled in some of these gaps in our understanding. But there is no commentary at all on this DVD containing ""Flags"" by itself. So I recommend you get Eastwood's 2-disc set containing both of his movie accouunts of Iwo Jima, plus a full commentary.

2724096,4,B000M4RG4C,"Clint Eastwood has marvelously portrayed a double-edged sword. Through flashbacks, he demonstrates the individual character and valor of real historical figures from the battle of Iwo Jima--boys one and all.

The three U.S. Marine battle survivors were saved from further bloodshed--albeit not their post traumatic stress, aka battle fatigue, or their guilt--by U.S. desperation for funds to cover the bullets, tanks and ships necessary to achieve victory in the Pacific theater.

Eastwood demonstrates that men can be heroes and villains at once. The ""heroes"" publicized by the renowned Iwo Jima photograph were really accidental stand-ins, albeit stand-ins who also risked their lives, replacing the first hoisted flag (on an officers' whim, to preserve the original for the soldiers who spilled their blood for it).

Yet these three men, (including a Pima tribesman, Ira Hayes, despised by many of the public and military men who welcome the heroes home) did more than most for the war effort--by helping to raise funds to save their fellow troops, although doing it meant betraying their honesty and the memories of the real flag-raisers. It was a question of savings lives.

But in plugging U.S. war bonds, the men were completely honest in one thing: investing was a way for Americans to honor the dead. That honor, and the self-effacement of the Iwo Jima bond campaigners, helped win the war.",1180137600,,1399,5.204444444444444

Eastwood kills the action, COLD TURKEY. He flashes ahead, after the battle, to tell the story of how the now-famous flag raising photograph wasn't what everyone thought. After spending some time there, he returns to battle. That's fine and all, but it ruined it for this reviewer. Consequently, I could never get my head back into the movie.

2724109,5,B000M4RG4C,"I'm in awe of Clint Eastwood once again. This film proves yet again that Eastwood stands alongside Scorsese and Spielberg as one of our greatest living directors. It doesn't surpirse me at all that the average movie goer still knows so little about mise-en-scene, montage, and the storytelling language of film. This film is told in mixed flashbacks. Eastwood chose to challenge the viewer. He used the same narrative structure in his film biopic BIRD. Sometimes great film is not easy for the average moviegoer to decode and appreciate. I understand the impact this has on the viewer. It's not an easy viewing experience. It requires patience and close study at times to fully grasp it's inherent meaning. Great poets do not always rhyme. This is not an Action film. This is a spiritual War Epic about patriotism and man's inhumanity to man. This film only made it onto a few of the major Top Ten Lists for 2006. (Many reserved that honor for Eastwood's LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA.) But, it sure made mine. I don't care about comparisons to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. (Spielberg is a Producer of this film.) I don't care about the accuracy of this story down to it's most minute detail. What I care about is the connection this film made with me as a human being. I don't wish to delineate the plot yet again. Read another review for that. What I wish to express is the meaning of this film to me. Especially, with Memorial Day approaching. I thought about this film long after having viewed it yesterday. And this is what I took away from this piece:

We elevate our Heroes to the status of faceless iconography to satisfy the ideology and needs of this country. All the while, our understanding and concern for The Veterans of this country attenuates. We no longer value the courageous soldier as the individual standardbearer of our freedom, only the ragged war memorials he represents. ""We The People"" fail to recognize that the ones lost to us, and the ones that come home to us from burning and savage lands, are really ourselves. Our fathers and sons. Our mothers and daughters. Our brothers and sisters. Our friends and neighbors. If we can't care for these people, how can we care for ourselves?

When we speak of patriotism, are we speaking about ourselves? Or, a false iconography that doesn't even represent itself? Patriotism starts at home. What would Twain, or Vonnegut say if they were here? Maybe when we speak of patriotism, we should speak the word humanism.

(Politicians today unjustly use our brave soldiers in Iraq to further the agendas of their constituencies in an unjust war under the guise of patriotism, in the very same way our Military unjustly used The Heroes of Iwo Jima and their families during World War II to raise money for a just and patriotic cause. This observation is mine, not Eastwood's.)

This poignant and timeless Masterpiece should be viewed as a part of our History for years to come.

I would also hold this film up against APOCALYPSE NOW, THE DEER HUNTER, and THE THIN RED LINE as another great spiritually subconscious War Epic. It speaks volumes about man's inhumanity to man.

I absolutely love this film. It's BRILLIANT. It now holds a special place of honor on my shelf and in my heart.

I hope that you're thoughtful when you view this. If you are thoughtful, you might be moved by it. I was moved to tears. This brutal and beautiful film deserves your undivided attention.

Thank you, Mr. Eastwood. BE GOOD TO YOURSELF.",1179878400,,3467,4.7190082644628095
2724110,3,B000M4RG4C,"Clint Eastwood is arguably our greatest living motion picture director. Thirty-five years after his directorial debut in the Hitchcock homage Play Misty for Me (1971), the silent, gritty actor who learned his filmmaking craft at the feet of such masters as Sergio Leone and Don Siegel has produced a body of work sweeping in variety of subject matter, yet singular in its artistic vision. While many of his contemporaries have slipped in critical esteem--most notably Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese--the two-time Oscar-winning director of Million Dollar Baby (2004) and Unforgiven (1992) has only improved with age.

Until now. In his latest cinematic offering, Eastwood misses the mark with this loose, relentlessly dark, and ultimately cynical adaptation of James Bradley's book of the same name.

The book was a tribute to the six Marines (one of them his father, John ""Doc"" Bradley) who raised Old Glory atop Mount Suribachi on the Japanese volcanic island of Iwo Jima, on February 23, 1945. Bradley's work chronicles the life stories of these six--three who survived the carnage that claimed almost 7,000 American lives: John Bradley, Ira Hayes, and Rene Gagnon; plus the three who perished: Franklin Sousley, Harlon Block, and Mike Strank. Of the survivors, none considered himself heroic for raising the flag or even for his deeds in combat. John Bradley shunned talk about the war, and it was only after his passing that son James found a shoebox in the family's attic containing mementos, most notably a Navy Cross. ""Doc"" Bradley, a corpsman (Navy lingo for ""medic""), had resuscitated a wounded Marine during a fierce firefight while his own body was ripped by Japanese shrapnel. Yet it was not for bravery that Bradley and his comrades were immortalized after the war, but rather for their chance appearance in Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal's iconic image--perhaps the most recognizable photograph in history, taken on the fifth day of the bloodiest battle of World War II.

Their individual achievements, identity, and dignity eventually became subsumed in the aura of the legend created by ""The Photo."" Through their stories, Bradley's exhaustively researched book gently prods the reader to consider the true nature of heroism. He pens a moving historical account, shedding light on the real lives of six individuals who rose to greatness despite their flaws and despite history's tendency to transform them into anonymous symbols of heroic virtue.

It's a powerful message which, sadly, gets mangled in Eastwood's overreaching screen adaptation. Although many of the elements of Bradley's account make it onscreen, in Eastwood's hands Flags of Our Fathers becomes a documelodrama--a ghastly tragedy that subverts the humanity of Bradley's account, becoming an overwrought portrait of the three surviving flag-raisers as victims.

To be sure, an interesting portrait it is--a story that promises to grab you by the heart and never let go. After Rosenthal's photo blazes across the front pages of America's newspapers, Bradley, Gagnon, and Hayes are whisked up by a cynical public relations machine to shill war bonds to a war-weary America. Though taking up only sixteen of the book's 382 pages, the war bond drive comprises the bulk of the film's plot and onscreen action.

The book treats the ""Mighty 7th"" War Loan bond drive ambivalently, though mostly positively. The drive raised over $26.3 billion from American individuals, families, and businesses--almost half of the 1946 fiscal year federal budget of $56 billion--thus making it possible to rearm the military to force Japan's defeat in the war's final months. ""When I spoke with a Treasury Department source by telephone to confirm these figures,"" Bradley writes, ""the official marveled over the size and accomplishments of the Mighty 7th. He fell silent for a moment as he shuffled some papers on his desk. Then he said, simply: `We were one then.'"" Indeed, without victory at Iwo Jima and the funds raised by the bond drive, the second most recognizable WWII photo--Alfred Eisenstaedt's August 15, 1945 shot of a returning sailor planting a big, juicy kiss on a nurse in Times Square on VJ Day--might never have been taken.

But Eastwood fixates on the bond drive, taking its highs and lows to distill a potent concoction of pure misery. His account depicts the men's whirlwind, whistle-stop tour of America's metropolises as a slick, gaudy sideshow run by contemptuous PR men. It's a chronicle of exploiting the flag-raisers by having them climb atop a papier-mch Mount Suribachi to raise the red, white, and blue--of tastelessly serving ice cream molded in the shape of the raising--of glad-handing businessmen and politicians who seek to use the men for their own profit.

Marine Private Ira Hayes becomes the movie's conscience during all the ballyhoo. ""I think this whole goddamn thing is a farce, if you ask me,"" he mutters. Yet the book version gives little such evidence of Hayes's revulsion. In one scene from the book, a politician introduces Hayes (a Pima American Indian) as ""the only man here who can claim to be a real American."" In the film version, actor Adam Beach reacts mostly silently and stoically. Perhaps Eastwood felt that Hayes's reaction in real life, in which he strode up to the microphone and exclaimed, ""I'm an Indian and I'm damn proud of it,"" would have undermined his effort to portray Hayes as a hapless victim of constant racial slurs.

The look and feel of the movie also serve to evince Eastwood's dark artistic agenda. A pall of foreboding darkness permeates not only the grueling battle scenes but even the movie's happier moments (e.g., coming back home to family, or Bradley marrying his childhood sweetheart), rendering them at best bittersweet. Director of photography Tom Stern filmed Flags of Our Fathers almost monochromatically, in swathes of rich cobalt blue, muting the other hues of the spectrum in the color timing.

However, the movie's chief flaw is in its confused narrative structure, told mostly by overusing flashbacks. Eastwood and editor Joel Cox used flashback montages to great effect in 1995's The Bridges of Madison County, but they don't quite pull it off here. As a viewer, I felt like a ping-pong ball paddled between the bond rallies and the battle scenes; by the middle of the film, I could already anticipate that a newspaper photographer's blinding flashbulb at a stadium appearance would cut right to a nighttime flare or exploding ordnance as one of the three soldiers relived the hell of war.

Although Eastwood captures the gory reality of the battle scenes, he never offers the viewer the reason for capturing Iwo Jima, or details of the genuinely heroic exploits of the twenty-two Marines and five sailors who were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor (the most given in any single battle in the history of American warfare). Furthermore, even after more than two hours, the viewer never really gets to know as individuals Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) or Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), not to mention the three flag-raisers who died.

The only thing that resonated with me at all was Adam Beach's moving performance as Ira Hayes. It's a tragic story of alcoholic despair and guilt that so many fellow Marines died while he was spared, ending with his loss of dignity and untimely death. Yet Hayes's story is poignant only as a vignette within an otherwise two-dimensional film and deserved fuller development, along the lines of Eastwood's biopic of saxophonist Charlie Parker, Bird (1988).

James Bradley closes his book by conveying great respect for his father's modest request to posterity:

After spending five years researching their lives, the boys certainly seem like heroes to me. I admit it.

But I must defer to my father.... I will take my dad's word for it: Mike, Harlon, Franklin, Ira, Rene, and Doc, the men of Easy Company--they just did what anybody would have done, and they were not heroes.

Not heroes.

They were boys of common virtue. Called to duty. Brothers and sons. Friends and neighbors. And fathers. It's as simple as that.

Anyone who had a friend or loved one who fought in World War II recognizes this modesty as a hallmark of that generation. My adopted godfather, Nick, a crusty old Marine who served in Guadalcanal, told me a thousand war stories, most of which involved goofing off with dames and alcohol, hitching rides back home on furlough, reminiscing about buddies who never made it back, playing practical jokes on each other. He never spoke about combat, though.

Nick was a real-life hero to me. I have no idea what he did to earn a chestful of ribbons, and I never asked him, because I figured that if he ever wanted me to know, he'd tell me. But he never did. And it never really mattered, because I learned from him that real heroes don't blow their own horn.

  Eastwood's version of their story is ultimately a deconstruction of their heroism. He basically writes off the heroic with a relativistic clich--""Everyone likes things nice and simple--good and evil, heroes and villains""--and ends with a bitter lament: ""Maybe there is no such thing as heroes."" Even Sergeant Sefton, Billy Wilder's cynic extraordinaire in the 1953 film Stalag 17, could become a hero with a heart of gold; but in Flags of Our Fathers, Eastwood performs a sort of reverse alchemy, chucking out gold nuggets while panning for mud.

  If Eastwood's aspirations were merely artistic, I'd regard Flags of Our Fathers as a flawed classic. But it's worse than that, because he has an agenda. He subverts the truth of these individuals' stories to craft a political message of exploitation. In doing so, Eastwood transforms Bradley, Gagnon, and Hayes into a sotto voce symbolic rebuke for the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner aboard the U.S.S. Lincoln aircraft carrier in 2003, when former Texas Air National Guard fighter pilot and current president George W. Bush co-piloted a Navy SB-3 Viking to mark victory in the Iraq war. Sure, I thought Bush was undignified in doing that, because although he had never served in combat a day in his life, he cast himself as some kind of returning war hero. The credit for that victory rightfully should have gone to those brave warriors who actually stood in harm's way.

That said, I found it highly ironic that despite Eastwood's strident crowing against the (mostly imaginary) exploitation of Bradley, Gagnon, and Hayes, he himself, having an ideological axe to grind, would exploit and trivialize these heroes over sixty years later.

Unlike in Unforgiven, his deconstruction of the ""Western myth,"" there is neither riveting drama nor stellar acting (with the exception of Beach) evident in Flags of Our Fathers to allow it to withstand the test of time. By belittling the heroism of its subjects, this flick will more than likely be regarded as one of Clint Eastwood's minor works, alongside forgettable movies like Blood Work (2002) and True Crime (1999).",1179619200,,10988,5.066408411732152

The second is also well done. The third is the shakiest bit but it is generally true to the history so I can't really make a judgement other than on what they decided to portray or not portray.

We don't often comment on or review a movie for it's message these days. The message of this film is that there are no heroes. It is repeated often. The problem with this message is it is false. The film even disproves it to be honest. Iwo Jima was an island crawling with heroes. The statement about the battle is that ""uncommon valor was a common virtue"" denotes the fact that more Medal of Honors were given at this battle than any other in the war. The sacrifice needed was great and met by the brave people that were there.

The Pacific War was a horrible war. The Japanese found themselves at the end of the colonial era without colonies. They originally had good intentions, I belive, with their ideals of a East Asian Co-Prosperity union. As it turned out, various factions destroyed any chance of that and what became of it was a brutal, murderous rampage through the Pacific. That had to be stopped.

So on that island were tens of thousands of Americans who knew this and knew that this was a very important battle that could not be lost. Not all of the heroes died on that island.

As for the 3 flag raisers - the country needed the money to finish the war and not conceed defeat to the Japanese. Apparently they were successful in their bond drive mission. Thus they were heroes, directly responsible for the success we had at the end of the war.

2724114,4,B000M4RG4C,"I was expecting a standard world war II movie: the explosions, the yelling, the confusion, the shaky camera, the best friend dying, and all the other horrors of war brought into your living room.

Although this movie has most of those elements, the main story is about the famous ""Raising of the flag"" photograph taken at Iwo Jima, and the surreal lives of the men behind it, who suddenly found that the simple act of getting their photograph taken while raising the flag made them overnight into national heroes.

In my opinion, this makes for a much more interesting movie. Standard war movies certainly have their place to help us understand what the average soldier goes through, but there are only so many of those you can watch, especially after ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Band of Brothers"", ""Thin Red Line"" and all the other war movies we've had in the past few years.

The story of the men behind the flag of Iwo Jima, and how they dealt awkwardly with their newfound fame, is a story that I was completely unaware of before, and one that deserves to be told. (Actually a bit of internet research reveals that this is not the first time their story has been told, but at least it's the first time for our generation. I had no idea before seeing this film.)

My internet research also reveals there is a bit of a debate about whether this is a patriotic film or an anti-war film. It is easy to see how you could go either way on this film. It does certainly touch on issues of government propaganda and media manipulation of the war, and one could easily make parallels to the way our government tried to frame the story of the Jessica Lynch rescue, or the Pat Tillman death.

However, politics aside, I thought it was just a really interesting story. And it does make you think about the nature of heroism and the culture of celebrity.

As with a lot of war movies, it is often hard to tell who is who in all the confusion. And the fact that this movie jumps around in time doesn't help. I was halfway through the film before I felt like I had a good handle on what was going on, and who was narrating the story. Some of this was probably intentional, but I think it could have done with better editing just the same.

""Flags"", as you would guess, tells the American side of the story, from both the battlefield and from the homefront as the ""heroes"" of the famous picture of Marines raising the flag on the island, are escorted around the U.S. in a last-ditch effort to sell war bonds. Eastwood explores many aspects of the nature of heroism, and what keeps troops fighting, which is often not much about heroism at all.  Wisely, Eastwood employs unknown actors to play the ""heroes"". There were a few recognizable faces among the brass and stateside players, but primarily Eastwood lets the story carry its own weight.  There's a good bit of ""blood and guts"" especially early on as the invasion is depicted, so I'd limit this one to adults and older high schoolers.",1178323200,,882,4.67741935483871

Eastwood tries to tell too much, I think, and the flashbacks get annoying eventually. While Adam Beach as Ira Hayes was fine, there could have been two films here: the heroic struggle for that damn island, and a sequel about the exploitation of the surviving flag-raisers. Two separate 90-minute movies, along with the third part of the trilogy, ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", giving the Japanese point of view, would have worked better. Still, this battle was ferocious and deserves to be honored for more than the 15-seconds of flag-raising on the fifth day of a 36-day fight.

2724121,5,B000M4RG4C,"This, together with Letters from Iwo Jima, should be praised as a true history lesson in a compact format.

I bought this movie just while waiting the release of Letters from Iwo Jima.

Now, as I understand it, on May 22nd there will be a 5-disc special edition boxed set released, that will not only contain both movies, but tons of extras, including the making of both movies, led by Actor-Director Clint Eastwood himself, as well as a fifth special disc, which will include a History Channel Documentary on that Battle and a second documentary as well.

So,  if you want to kill some time, as I usually do, buy ""Flags of our Fathers"" now. For its price it is well worth it, but comes with no extras whatsoever.

Then, on May 22, you may really want to dig in, and get this 5-disc special edition of both movies.

I think that for the true historian in all of us, seeing for the first time ever, a story of one of the bloodiest Battles in World War II from both perspectives is a unique experience to say the least.

Maybe, if one day somebody could come up with an original idea of this type, concerning the Battle of Huertgen Forest, probably one of the bloodiest ones on the Western Front, except maybe for Stalingrad and Operation Bagration, but which saw U.S. Troops opposed by German Guns, then we would have a somewhat complete picture of what that bloody war was perceived even in Europe, from both perspectives (Germans were as scared as the U.S. troops, since they knew perfectly well that if they had lost this Battle, the doors to Germany would finally be wide open to the Allies).

Anyway, back to ""Flags of Our Fathers"". It is made documentary style, a bit like ""Band of Brothers"", in which you have survivors talking about their experiences and reliving them through the movie itself.

The photography is a bit crude, but I think that for a movie like this one, having it in soft tones, would have falsified the sense of harshness and hostility that pervaded that piece of rock.

Also interesting is the sarcastic if not ironic part on who's who, in planting the Flag on top of that famous mound on Iwo Jima.

As if from this depended the victory of the Allies over the Japanese Imperial Forces.

Go figure the ridiculous logic behind otherwise so much serious and tragic facts. While people get their limbs blown off their bodies, there is a bureaucrat somewhere, trying to find out who the heck the guy was, who actually did plant that Flag...

Perhaps, if we had sent those idiots into the war, especially as reconnaissance officers, we would have gotten rid of some useless people, whose specialty is to sharpen pencils all day long.

This is a beautiful movie, well made, and despite the lack of Big Names a la Hollywood, it is very well acted in a very naturalistic way and this seems to be Clint Eastwood's personal touch.

Don't forget that Clint was a relatively unknown actor himself when he suddenly became famous with the Dollar Trilogy and the Man with No Name. Although he appeared in various episodes of ""Rawhide"", he never truly made it as a major actor until then.

This is probably also the way he pays his dues back, and let me say, he works with these actors in the most beautiful way. You can tell that these guys, if they have it within them, will one day become ""somebodies"", rather than just stay forever as ""unknown"" actors.

All in all, this is a great history lesson told by a master in movie making.

I can recommend it to anyone seriously interested in World War II.",1177027200,,3512,4.530063291139241
2724122,4,B000M4RG4C,"War and symbols of war have endured in the public consciousness ever since human beings began to throw stones at each other in the Paleolithic. The brutality that is war is horrific enough but when distorted images of that war begin to percolate in the minds of those who have not participated in that war, then the result is to recreate a false reality that brings shame to those who died so that we today can wonder what is true and what is not.  In FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, director Clint Eastwood exposes one of the lingering myths of image corruption: the symbiotic relation between the need of the home population to create and revel in heroes who urge us to fight when common sense says not to and the heroes themselves who are called heroes but wonder why that is so.

During the last few months of the war in the Pacific, the battle to defeat Japan was going well in a military sense, but not well in a financial sense.  Unless America became willing to dig deeply into its collective pockets to buy bonds to finance the war, then the warfare itself might grind to an ignominious halt.  Eastwood saw the raising of the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi as a two level symbol, of which the first level was plainly proclaimed by all concerned in 1945--that is that American power was invincible and inexorable.  The bulk of FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, however, digs deeply into the subtext of that symbol to suggest that it is not enough for any culture to identify and elevate a soldier myth that will invigorate that nation's will to win.  In the sad tale of the three Americans who raised the flag but did not see themselves as worthy of all that hoopla, Eastwood implies that for a nation to be truly worthy of greatness, the heroes themselves must not be afflicted with self-loathing such that the result will be harmful to the war effort. The case of Ira Hayes, the native American who fought harder to stay out of the glare of publicity than he did to stay out of the way of Japanese bullets clearly shows the tragic consequences of elevating unwilling heroes to the pantheon of self-enlightened heroes.  As soon as that first photo (or second photo) was taken, it should have occurred to the Financial Powers That Be that these three American soldiers might not be able to survive climbing the paper-mache Mr. Suribachi any more successfully than their less fortunate mates were in slogging their way up on the real one.  In FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, Eastwood skillfully depicts that the relation between our need to create heroes and the need of those very heroes to want to be needed is very tricky indeed, and we who see this film and those like it need to ask ourselves a series of troubling questions that bothered Ira Hayes even as he leaned into that iron pipe on that mountain top on Iwo Jima.",1176595200,,2802,4.534653465346534
2724123,5,B000M4RG4C,"Why do we do this to our children? Our brothers? Our husbands and lovers? I'm no fan of war, to be sure; and I grew up in the military: an Army Brat. It provided security for my family when there was none to be had anywhere else - much like today.

WWII was supposed to be the war to end all wars - so they said. They sold it then, as they sell it now; for profit. There are no heroes; there are only men, women, soldiers doing as they are told - and that should be enough to honor their lives more than we do by sending them off to die.

The graphic battle footage reminded me very much of Saving Private Ryan only more so. More than I needed, but in cases like this I tell myself, ""If they had to experience it, the least I could do is to bear witness."" From the comfort of my favorite chair, I don't feel I have the right to complain.

Did they die for my freedom? I'm not sure what they died for. The politics of war: Freedoms are eroding all around us. The conflicting reality of the war between how it was portrayed ""at home"" and how it was experienced in the field is enough to make anyone crazy, I'm sure. The soldiers who survived lived those traumas for the rest of their lives - and for what?

We have a responsibility, a duty as citizens, to pay attention. To hold our government accountable for these atrocities as they are committed each and every generation. They should not be based on a lie. They all too often are.

This point was made powerfully by the character played by Adam Beach - a point he makes in all of his movies subtly, wisely, artfully. The stereotypes were not his - they belonged to the men around him, and he has every right to point them out, as do all of the many Native American actors doing such good work today. Adam Beach is a beautiful, talented, remarkable human being. I have followed his work since Squanto, Smoke Signals and Dance Me Outside. He is a gift to our generation.

2724127,3,B000M4RG4C,"Flags of Our Fathers (2006): For a movie about the flag, Clint Eastwood does not wave it enough. After his death, the son of one of the six flag raisers on Iwo Jima, wrote a terrific book (read it) on which this movie is based. Three of the flag raisers later died in the fight on Iwo Jima and the remaining three were brought home for a bond tour. Before the movie, I knew the strategic reasons for taking Iwo Jima, the failure of the pre-landing bombardment, and the impossible task asked of the Marines. Still, the manner in which the movie skips back and forth between the interviews of the son in preparing for his book, the actual battle on the island, and the bond tour, left me confused.  Eastwood apparently wanted to make a movie about the futility of war, an up-to-date Paths of Glory, but to the American people, Iwo Jima will always be remembered as the highest example of valor. The movie should have alternated between the Marines on Iwo Jima and the three flag raisers at home on the bond tour. Their confusion and guilt over being called heroes while their friends were still dying would have given the movie a context that made it understandable to the viewer. The flag raising occurred four days after the landing, but the hard brutal fighting, basically Marines with rifles against entrenched positions, went on for three more weeks. We suffered 26,000 Marine casualties on Iwo Jima, one third of all Marine casualties in the Pacific war. 6,800 died, more than double the deaths in the Twin Towers and 27 men (22 Marines and 5 Navy corpsmen), won the Medal of Honor, of which one half were posthumous. Eastwood thinks the loss of 20,000 Japanese is due to some equivalent concern, apparently shared by some of the reviewers who look forward to seeing Letters From Iwo Jima.",1175990400,,1793,4.620689655172414

2724130,4,B000M4RG4C,"I learned much from watching Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers.  I did not know that there were actually two flag raisings atop Mount Sarabachi, that three of the men that took part in the ""second"" flag raising embarked on a nationwide bondraising tour effort, or that families were confused as to whom was actually photographed in the famous photo. The battle scenes in the film are grim reminders of how brutal, violent, and unforgiven war can be.  The Iwo Jima landscape looked like the surface of the moon.  I cannot imagine the courage and valor that it must have taken for U.S. servicemen to advance on a sulphurous, barren island that Japanese troops were literally entrenched in.  Director Eastwood holds nothing back in transporting viewers to the surreal battlefield known as Iwo Jima-5 stars here.  The glimpse into the preparations, psyche, and nervous anticipation of young men preparing for the assault on this 5 mile island of hell also warrants-5 stars.  What was a bit disappointing was the back and forth editing between the 3 remaining flag raisers lives as posterboy heros for the U.S. war bond effort and their roles as soldiers on Iwo Jima.  For instance what actually became of the soldiers that hoisted the first flag? Wouldn't they feel compelled to tell the press that it was their platoon that first raised the flag?  Also the film never really clarifies the confusion over the soldier who was thought to be one of the six flag raisers.

Based on the novel of the same name by James Bradley, Eastwood focuses on the sensational hype surrounding the raising of the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi.  Once the famous photo of this heroic act hit the media, it's exploitation began immediately as a rallying cry to raise war bonds to fund the war effort.

The three surviving flag raisers were hustled around the country on a government sponsored tour.  Ryan Phillippe plays ""Doc"" Bradley, author James Bradley's father, a Navy corpsman and actual flag raiser.  Adam Beach playing native American Ira Hayes and Jesse Bradford playing Rene Gagnon were his compatriots.  None of the men felt particularly heroic and had misgivings about their exploitative actions, their sentiments back with their buddies still in the fight.

The graphic wartime action of the horrors of the actual battle contrasted sharply with orchestrated tour stateside and all it's hoopla.

2724151,4,B000M4RG4C,"Count this film as one that practically demands that a viewer also read the book, which fully deserves its five-star rating. Director Eastwood gives the right balance of coverage of the lead-up to the battle, the battle itself, the dual flag-raising, and the promotional tour to sell war bonds. The movie can't seem to make up its mind whether the immensely successful tour, with its elevation of non-heroes to heroes, was good or not. Obviously the impact on America on a grand scale and the three survivors was profound.

""Doc"" Bradley is the central character of the movie, with Ryan Phillippe's performance fine and somewhat understated. Adam Beach is the true star, with his moving portrait of Ira Hayes. This human drama is part of what makes the full story so compelling: the diversity of the flag raisers (the book covers the widely varying backgrounds of all six) and the drama that followed.

The movie is shot in very muted tones and colors for the Iwo scenes, matching the drab, seemingly endless grays of the volcanic sands, and the grim battle action. The first wave invites comparison with ""Saving Private Ryan"", and while on a smaller scale, the action is riveting. The focus on the embedded Japanese hidden from view is exactly right. The 30 days of battle after the flag raising are mostly ignored, as they had to be, other than occasional comments about the real heroes who continued to die.

I'm ambivalent about the time shifting. It would never have worked in the book. Here it works ok, breaking up what probably would have gotten repetitive, as the tour moved from one stop to another.

For a war movie, this film can be watched (as I did) on a small screen. Don't hesitate to watch this DVD on your TV. Too bad there wasn't any supplemental material, and it's sad to think that both Joe Rosenthal and the man who took a movie of the flag raising are now gone. The movie, indirectly mentioned by showing it being shot next to Joe Rosenthal, helped prove that the photo wasn't staged. The accusations of staging come up a few times in the movie and are never addressed or explained, as we the viewers know what happened.",1174694400,,2143,4.676392572944297
2724152,4,B000M4RG4C,"While the film has excellent production qualities and a great effort by cast and crew, it suffers from a needless scene shifting which will confuse most average under 30 American viewers. As most Americans alive today don't have a clue about the bloody events on Iwo Jima in 1945, Eastwood gets trapped in the notion of doing confusing scene shifts with the characters. Instead, he should have stayed with the traditional time progressive style of directing. People today get too confused with jumping around characters and events, messing with the natural time line of events.

Great special effects, a major epic that just misses the mark of being a classic. It is not well known, but Eastwood directed basically two films at one time: 'Flags of Our Fathers' and the Japanese side of things 'Letters from Iwo Jima' which must have been a daunting task even for old Clint.

At third glimpse, Flags of our Fathers is, again, nothing more than just another World War II movie.

Let me elaborate a bit: I bought this movie when it came out, expecting the usual fantastic Clint Eastwood direction that I saw in Million Dollar Baby. And since Steven Spielberg was one of the producers, who did Saving Private Ryan, I really, genuinely thought I was going to love ""Flags of our Fathers."" The movie starts out on its feet, running with a bang--the first 30-45 minutes of the movie are very, very interesting, involves much character development, and even packs some good humor into it. The war scenes on the beach of Iwo Jima are very, very intense with lots of good camera-work and throughout the movie there is plenty of disturbing war gore with people's insides covering their bodies, like in Saving Private Ryan. So far, so good, right? Wrong. As the movie progresses, it gets incredibly confusing, you'll find yourself rewinding parts frequently because you thought you missed something, and above all, painfully boring. I tried to keep up with the flashbacks, which I LOVE in films, but they seemed randomly placed and I couldn't believe Clint Eastwood was directing this mess. The ending is awkward and afterwards I pondered the film and thought, ""My, that was EASILY one of Eastwood's worst films ever."" If I were you, I'd save my money on Flags of our Fathers.

The movie follows the book quite closely and does not glorify any of the actors, which is a refreshing change after having always been previously fed so many Hollywood glamorized war movie versions such as John Wayne starring in The Sands of Iwo Jima or Aldo Ray in Battle Cry.  The movie doesn't particularly follow any story line other than the sequence of the invasion and the actual flag raising and the confusion caused later to the participants.  The battle scenes are more like video bytes and snap shots and fairly graphic which I believe is probably more true to life with the experience of intense battle punctuated by moments of terror and tragedy.

2724179,3,B000M4RG4C,"When I saw the previews for Flags of Our Fathers, I was excited for a couple of reasons.  First, I am a World War II buff, but have studied the European theater and want to know more about the war in the Pacific - the so-called American War, as it was linked directly to an attack on Americans at Pearl Harbor.

Secondly, my great uncle was a Marine involved in the island hopping campaign to reach Japan.  I have heard stories of what it was like and wanted this film to add to those stories.

While there were parts of the film that were interesting, the information was not woven together in a cohesive final product.  Little vignettes of action that were supposed to help tell the story of the fight for Iwo Jima end up being snippets of what is really one of the most compelling fights in American history, and the definitive Marine battle of all time.

When you read the book, you really understand why the fight for Iwo was so important.  You find out why 70,000 men were sent to this little spit of land to fight and die.  The atrocities committed by the Japanese both before and during World War II are explained and add a prelude to the hell that the Marines knew they would face once they reached the beaches.

The structure of the island fortress - considered one of the most heavily armed fortresses in history - is explained, giving the feeling that the Marines were lucky to win the battle, even after 36 days of tortuous fighting.

The idea that the picture of the flag raising could give a nation hope is understandable, especially given the era and the painful four years leading up to the battle.

But the film - well, it just goes off in it's own direction, with Clint Eastwood's help of course.  Where do I begin?  Well, war is hell and not as simple as it seems from the history books.  OK - got that.  These men were not looking to be set up as heroes, but were thrust into the spotlight for the good of a voracious government war machine that needed heroes to convince the public to continue financing a horrendously expense battle for the benefit of the free world.  Check.  Life back home was not a bed of roses.  Roger.

But none of that really tells the story of what happened at Iwo Jima.  It doesn't even really tell the story of what happened to these three boys at Iwo Jima.  It touches on the issue, but it leaves the battle as a secondary item on Eastwood's agenda, which seems to be to tell us that our young soldiers end up as grist for the public mill.  That the press uses a good story for it's own benefit, even if the truth must be distorted a bit.  That the government doesn't really care about the real truth as long as it can use the boys for propaganda purposes.

Well, in case no one understands the history of WWII, the fight was one we had to win.  The Japanese military leaders were murderous in their techniques, their teachings, and their actions.  Find the book and read the section about the slaughter in China, before we entered the war, where 350,000 civilians were slaughtered in one month (correct, one month).

If three young men could capture the hearts of the American people and move the war to a speedier conclusion, then that was more important than those three men and their privacy or personal feelings.  As Marines who professed to be fighting for the sake of their fellow Marines, they should have understood that wars are won (and fellow soldiers saved) on the home front as well as on the battlefield.  The personal sacrifices of the publicity tour at home were a small price to pay for the thousands of lives saved due to a shortened war.

If only Clint Eastwood had been able to clarify that issue.  Instead he seems to want to show us that these poor pitiful boys were just pawns in the hands of the Corp and the US government.

2724183,4,B000M4RG4C,"The bloody battle of Iwo Jima is the catalyst for the drama in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers,""  but this is not a ""war"" movie in the usual sense. Although there are many effectively staged battle scenes, the focus is more on the aftermath of the war for three soldiers (Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford , and Adam Beach), only two of whom were even present in the historic photograph of the flag raising at Iwo Jima, who are cast as the ""Heroes"" by a government desperate to sell war bonds to fund victory in World War II.

Though many critics compared ""Flags"" to ""Saving Private Ryan,"" perhaps because the latter's director, Steven Spielberg, was a co-producer, Eastwood's film is closer in spirit to ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and even ""Coming Home."" It examines society's need for heroes and the dehumanizing effect such status can have on those singled out for the honor. These men are perfectly aware that they are basking in glory that may more rightfully belong to those who did not survive, who were, as one of them reminds a cheering crowd, killed on the island of Iwo Jima.

""Flags of Our Fathers"" has an epic sweep, but it is essentially a character study, not only of the men who fought the battle, but of a society so willing to exploit them.

The performances are all noteworthy, but it is Adam Beach as the tragic Ira Hayes who offers the standout performance. Had ""Flags"" not been a box-office disappointment, Beach would likely have been deservedly Oscar nominated as best supporting actor.

The film is not without its flaws. The multiple flashbacks can sometimes make things confusing, and the music score, by Eastwood himself, is too muted for its own good. A more stirring score might have enhanced the emotional effect of the story. Still, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is easily one of the best films of 2006 and one of the finest films to ever deal with World War II.

John Wayne was probably just as famous for his big screen persona and movies, as he was for
his love of America. I idolized him. Ok, so I thought he was pretty handsome, too.

So, when I heard that they were remaking a movie about Iwo Jima, I thought, how could they improve on something already done, ""Sands of Iwo Jima"". Wayne got an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Sergeant Stryker, a Marine with a tough exterior and a heart. He taught his ""boys"" how to be a Marine and how to survive. Tough love was his method and by the end of the movie, when he was killed, even his opponents understood his impact on their survival. The flag was raised on Mt. Suribachi. The film began with a written memorial on the screen for the Marines that fought in WWII with patriotic background music. It ended with more patriotic music and the understanding of how proud we should be of the men that fought.

It was a great movie to honor the soldiers of WWII Pacific, only the movie only told part of the story.

I was reluctant to give the movie Flags of our Fathers a chance, and didn't see it in the theater. Didn't seem to find the time. I had read information about the flag raisers on the Internet and wondered how much more there was to talk about these young boys that I had already read about. Boy was I wrong.

I bought the paperback, Flags of our Fathers. The beginning is a recap of the history of the boys that raised the ""2nd"" flag on Mt. Suribachi. I already knew that, but continued to read. It just got better and better. James Brady gave such a good description of the Marine ethic and Semper Fidelis, that I just wanted to hug a Marine after reading about their courage to serve against the worst odds. Then I read about the battle on Tarawa. That was brutal. The next battle was Iwo Jima. We thought there might be 12,000 Japs/Nips on the island. We were wrong. There were over 20,000 dug into the island in a massive hive up to 7 levels deep. The had hidden bunkers that just fired away. We lost so many soldiers. Battleships were shelling the island with little effect. It was the Marines that just kept coming and coming ashore to take the island. The Flag was raised twice on the 4thd day. The 2nd raising was on the front page of every paper. US Citizens rallied when they saw that picture of such bravery. For many Americans, that picture was hung on the wall in their homes.

The battle raged for another 30 some days. 3 of the six flag raisers were killed on the island. The Sergeant Stryker character from ""Sands"" was a flag raiser. He was killed by friendly fire. He was just as tough as ""Wayne"", but had a soft side. He told his boys, ""Follow my orders and I will get you back to your Mothers"". These were mostly kids, dying before they lived.

The 3 remaining flag raisers went on a national tour for the 7th bond drive. When WWII was fought, citizens purchased bonds to support the war.

When the 3 flag raisers returned home they were on their own. There was no GI bill to help educate those returning. There was no post traumatic stress help. Brady had a job as a mortician, Hayes drank himself to death, and Gagnon rose to become a janitor.

I just wanted to cry for these boys. Brady never told anyone about the experience. Never discussed his awards. Never let anyone know the humanity he helped as a corpsman and those that he couldn't. He lost a friend to the Japs and found him tortured. Eyes gouged out, finger nails ripped off, ears cut off, and his penis in his mouth.

If there was ever a reason to nuke these [...], it was their cruelty and just out right inhuman mentality.

I bought the movie. It is a great representation of the book.

Wayne and ""Sands"" gave us insight into the war, but Brady and ""Flags"" gave us total reality. I certainly understand now why my Father and others didn't want to talk about WWII. Who would want to remember the atrocities? We WON and it was because of a whole generation of young kids.

2724198,1,B000M4RG4C,"I should mention several things before writing this article.  First, I love Clint Eastwood and have been a big fan of his since I was a boy.  I've enjoyed watching how his directing has matured.  Secondly I am a ""history buff"" and love WWII and films about it.  Thirdly, I read the book that this movie was based on about a year ago.  I had looked forward to reading the book very much, wanting to learn more about the battle of Iwo Jima.  I was quite disappointed in the book, finding it boring, and overly focused on events before and after the battle (the battle itself seems to be given the bum's rush as if it's an inconvenient intruder on the story of the author's father.)  I had hoped that Eastwood's skill as a director might help to undo some of the book's flaws.

Sadly, not only does Eastwood fail to fix the book's flaws, the flow of this movie compounds on it.  The one thing I can credit the book with is that it generally told the story in a linear fashion, even if it rushes through the battle with its eyes closed.  Eastwood instead decides to flash back and forward between the battle and the three flag-raising survivors' subsequent war bonds tour.  The result is a disjointed, dispirted and frankly boring piece of work that does not do justice to the men who gave their lives at Iwo Jima.  The battle itself seems to get even shorter thrift in the movie than in the book.  The style robs the battle of any congruence so that you never know where the soldiers are, why they are there, how they got there and what obstaces they faced to achieve what they did.

Perhaps the most glaring example of this is when the movie covers the deaths of several of the flag raisers in a series of brief (1 to 2 minutes, sometimes as little as 10-20 seconds) flashbacks to the battle.  It's almost as if Eastwood is simply impatient to get rid of them so he can return to the ""point"" of how they were constructed as heroes after the battle.

The narration is completely unnecessary, stealing the most saccarine moments from ""Saving Private Ryan"" (the corny ""present day"" intro and ending) and preaching to the audience.

In short, if you're hoping to see a movie about the Battle of Iwo Jima, this is not it.  I suspect this movie does little justice to the experience of the soldier's on the American side.  I can only hope that the Japanese side gets a better touch in ""Letters from Iwo Jima.""",1173484800,,2401,4.415909090909091

2724205,4,B000M4RG4C,"Clint Eastwood's adaption of James Bradley's best selling story of the men who raised the flag on Mt Suribachi is almost as good as the book.  Told through flashbacks, the movie covers the events leading up to, and the bond tour following the battle for Iwo Jima.

The movie is very well done, portraying the men as reluctant celebrities scarred by their experiences.  Three of the six men who appeared in the classic photo survived the battle.  They were whisked back to the states and exploited on a tour to sell war bonds.  The battle scenes are intense and graphic, and Eastwood has done a great job of recreating the atmosphere of 1945 America.

However, while the book gave life stories of all six of the flag raisers, as well as another marine who was mistakenly identified as having been in the photo, the movie does not.  If you have not read the book, you may not even recognize all of the characters.  We learn nothing of their backgrounds or their personalities.  The book also goes into much greater detail on the relationship of ""Doc"" Bradley and a young marine known as ""Iggy"" and the impact of that relationship on Bradley for the rest of his life.  This is gone over superficially in the film.

2724212,5,B000M4RG4C,"In 2006, Clint Eastwood launched one of his most inspired projects; Two war movies, set during World War II on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" was the first. It received generally good reviews, but had a lukewarm reception from audiences. Then came the 2nd one, the Japanese language ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" That film received great reviews, was embraced by audiences, and was nominated for Best Picture. Having said that, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" definitely falls into the category of underrated. I don't particularly like war movies, but this is a great film and I think it's one of the best films of 2006. The cast is made up of mostly young actors, often called ""pretty-boys"" such as Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, and Paul Walker.

It also features an Oscar worthy supporting performance by Adam Beach and some great supporting work by Jamie Bell, Barry Pepper, and others. Phillippe plays John ""Doc"" Bradley, a Navy Corpsman. Bradford plays Rene Gagon, a runner. Beach plays Ira Hayes, an Indian. These three men go from mere soldiers to American heroes after a picture is taken of them raising the flag. Thrust into the spotlight, the men cope with being considered heroes when they point out that the real heroes are the men lying dead on the island of Iwo Jima. Eastwood uses cinematography with a heightened visual reality that makes the film a wonder to behold. Now, as I said, audiences haven't received this movie in the same way they did say ""Saving Private Ryan."" I will say that out of the last few films Eastwood has directed (Mystic River & Million Dollar Baby), this one is the weakest. But it's an inspired project with a great script, terrific cinematography, wonderful performances, and great direction. Beach (a relative newcomer) delivers the best performance in the movie, really getting under the skin of the most troubled of the characters. Phillippe and Bradford are also very good, although hardly Oscar worthy. A lot of people complain that the film doesn't make you care enough about the characters and that is partly true. It's certainly not as character-driven as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Deer Hunter,"" but I liked the characters and did care about them so I guess it's just a matter of perspective. Even if you're hesitant to see this film because you don't like war movies or something, I urge you to see it. It's a great film.

2724215,4,B000M4RG4C,"While I have not read James Bradley's book of the same title, others have noted that this movie is more or less about one chapter in the book rather than a movie version of the entire book.  Some see this as a flaw, however, it is impossible to tell the full story of hundreds of pages in a book in a feature movie.  This movie focuses on providing us with some notions of what really happened on Mount Suribachi and what happened to the men in that famous and iconic photograph of that flag raising during the Battle of Iwo Jima.

It wasn't the first flag raised there.  The photograph is of a replacement flag being put up because the first flag was requisitioned for historical and political reasons.  However, the photograph by Joe Rosenthal (who died in 2006) hit a strong chord with the public and earned him a Pulitzer Prize.  Since there were two flag raisings there was confusion about who was in the famous photograph and this movie deals with the pain that caused the families.  It caused the pain because one of those in the first flag raising was originally identified in the second flag raising and one who was in that second raising was originally left out (although his mother believed it was him).

This happened for three additional reasons: none of the faces are seen in the photograph, none of the men who were there paid much attention to the flag detail - staying alive during the fighting was their main focus, and half the men in the photograph died shortly after the flag raising (including the young man mistakenly not given credit for being in the detail), as well as the young man who was in the first flag raising but identified in the photograph.

The movie tells the story in a rather random series of flashbacks.  It is set in roughly present time with some of the participants as old men who are telling their story and the story of the men they knew to a younger generation.  This is not only an important thing to do, it is essential for both the passing and the rising generations.  The telling gets a bit more complicated when the three survivors of the second flag raising are enlisted on a war bond fund raising tour and they have flashbacks to their service before and on Iwo Jima.

One of the other misconceptions people have about that photograph is that it was done after the victory on the island.  However, it was done after that mountain was taken five days into the battle.  The fighting after was furious and went on for another thirty days.

Some have noted that this movie is anti-war and that Eastwood might be using it to criticize the Iraq war.  I suppose one could see it that way.  I didn't.  However, Eastwood is headed towards being eighty years old.  Old men do not see or often believe the stories of heroism and valor that motivate younger men.  They call such notions lies and delusions.  Yes, war is indeed a horrible and awful thing.  It requires men to do barbaric and even inhuman things.  But it is too glib to say it is unnecessary.  It is too pat to simply dismiss war as the machinations of old politicians or corporations or ""obsolete"" nation-states.  To me, what these young men gave is too sacred to say they died for nothing.  To say they only fought and died for their immediate buddies is possibly true in the heat of battle, but not in the larger sense of the cause.  If we should beware of being misused through patriotism and love of country, we should also beware of being misled by a kind of sedition fueled by nihilism; a belief in nothing.  Nihilism has become fashionable and we should beware of mistaking transient fashions, especially fashionable beliefs, for truth.

However, it has to be left to you what you get out of this movie.  For me it was sad and elegiac.  War does not, life does not evaluate and select only those most fit for a situation before it requires them to live it.  These men who survived after the flag raising were certainly required to live with survivor's guilt made much worse by the adulation they received on the publicity tour for the bond drive.  They were constantly called ""The Heroes of Iwo Jima"" when they knew they were just ordinary soldiers.  This duty their country demanded of them crushed them more than they understood at the time.  Nevertheless, it was duty they fulfilled as best they could.

A fine film, if a bit difficult to follow at times.  But war is often unclear and confusing, isn't it?",1173139200,,4424,4.518238993710692

2724228,4,B000M4RG4C,"As the beautiful visuals of Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers"" unfold, it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of battle and forget the point that Eastwood is trying to make: sometimes the real heroes are the ones forgotten, left dead on Iwo Jima in this instance. Everyone has seen the photograph of six men planting a flag on Iwo Jima. It has become a symbol of American valor. However, as we watch the three surviving men being sent back to America on a nationwide tour full of reenactments and autographs, all for the purpose of selling war bonds, the obvious difference between real and fake heroes is defined. The circumstances surrounding the incident are surprising and interesting.

Clint Eastwood does a fantastic job with his direction. This film is not about the entire battle, it only focuses on the flag-raisers and the critical moments for them at Iwo Jima. Eastwood juxtaposes scenes from the battle and from the tour perfectly, and the cinematography is astounding. This film pays tribute to the men who died and still die to defend American freedom, and does so in a respectful fashion, while still being fraught with gunfire and explosions.",1172793600,,1170,4.85
2724229,4,B000M4RG4C,"Having seen the companion film ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" first in the theater, I think the memory of that superbly executed film adds a dramatic resonance to this one, even though this war epic was released first in 2006. Moreover, the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers, upon which this film is based, is a mesmerizing read, and the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis is a relatively faithful and eloquent adaptation. For all these credentials, this film just misses greatness in spite of Clint Eastwood's masterful direction and first-class production values.

The primary flaw is in the way the non-linear narrative is structured as it intersperses the graphic Iwo Jima battle sequences with the homecoming and cross-country bond-selling tour of three of the six men who hoisted the U.S. flag (the second as it turns out) atop Mt. Suribachi in the legendary photo. On top of this juxtaposition, Eastwood uses the framing device of author Bradley conducting the research that resulted in his book. His father, John ""Doc"" Bradley, was the last surviving GI in that momentous picture, a Navy corpsman who was assigned with the Marines that fateful day of the assault. Whereas all six flag raisers were examined in depth in the book, the three survivors are the film's focus, making the others, including the men who put up the first flag, rather shadowy, interchangeable figures.

The viscerally effective scenes on the island do not hold back on the almost unwatchable carnage, and a couple of brief scenes appear to mirror the events depicted from the Japanese perspective in ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". The film brings up intriguing insights into both the nebulous perception of heroism and the mercenary financing necessary to maintain the war effort, especially as both aspects manifest themselves on the way the elder Bradley, along with fellow heroes Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes, respond differently to the homefront adulation. The final scenes emphasize sentimentality and weaken the movie's flow considerably as the perspective and context changes. Nevertheless, there are many truly moving and powerful moments throughout, and Eastwood's craftsmanship manages to triumph over his storytelling skills.

It's somewhat disappointing that the performances vary as much as the characters. As Gagnon, Jesse Bradford brings a plaintive quality to a paper-thin character who welcomes his celebrity status as he is prodded by his fame-baiting girlfriend. Ryan Phillipe comes across as even less defined since he has to play Bradley as an elliptical mediator. A genuinely weak link is provided by John Slattery, all bluster and no depth as a Treasury Department official. Adam Beach, however, is a standout as the tortured Hayes in a gut-wrenching performance as an alcoholic constantly patronized as an American Indian and riddled with guilt over those who sacrificed their lives on the island. As with ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", Tom Stern's muted cinematography and the late Henry Bumstead's period production design are superbly rendered. I'm really surprised at the sparseness of extras on the 2007 DVD - no director's commentary, no scene selections, no making-of feature, just two previews, ""Babel"" and unsurprisingly, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"".",1172793600,,3257,5.271676300578035

I particularly thought the execution of non-linear plot was poor and frustrating because its lack of connections...it's just there and hopefully the viewers will make some sense out of it.

The movie also did not do justice for the actual battle...for a war in which 18,000 japanese died and 26000 Allied forces casualties, nothing in the film convey enough sense of the enormity of this brutal battle. Instead of doing the scene similar to Saving Private Ryan, it took the short cut and disengaged the viewer by spending too much time on the historical accuracy of how that flag was raised, who was involved and what really happened....that's all great but I kept thinking, was that it? If I want to watch a documentary I can always go to history channel.

This film will touch you at the core of your humanity! There are no illusions in the story of it being a 'good war', because the truth is all wars are destructive in such huge proportions, though often deemed 'necessary'. The realization that something is considered a 'good fight' is sometimes missing the truth; that war damages everything in its wake, causing one to wonder how the word 'good' and 'war' could've ever been paired at all.

It matters that they were there and no matter what their duties they risked their lives for freedom from those that would enslave and kill without remorse. No glossy coating of what happened, but the truth.

Like the men of the Memphis Belle, three men of the six that raised the second flag at Iwo Jima are honored as heroes and brought home to do a War Bond tour. They feel uncomfortable being praised when the others from the first flag raising and second are all dead. Not to mention the fact that so many that had nothing to do with the flag raising risked their lives or gave the ultimate sacrifice to take the island. We see the tremendous toll it took on their lives and part of the horrors they saw on Iwo Jima. Not an easy movie to view and certainly not for the whole family.

2724248,5,B000M4RG4C,"With Flags Of Our Fathers receiving so many negative reviews, I hesitated in buying the DVD.  Still, I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director, plus I love movies about World War II.  I purchased the film and found myself really liking it.  I was surprised.  Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting big things to happen.  Anyway, I had no trouble with the flash-backs, or the character development, or the fact that the battle for Iwo Jima wasn't covered as heavily as was the effort to raise money with the rallies for War Bonds.  I had no problem following the movie and was caught up in it within the first few minutes.  I thought the performances were excellent by all three of the main actors (Jesse Bradford, Ryan Phillippe and Adam Beach), and that Clint Eastwood did a marvelous job of conveying the fact that war is hell and that no soldier goes untouched by what he or she experiences.  In fact, the movie made me feel sad for what the real-life soldiers--John ""Doc"" Bradley, Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes--had to go through once the war was over.  One day you're a celebrity, then the next day no one wants to return your phone calls.  I have nothing bad to say about Flags Of Our Fathers.  I really enjoyed this movie and look forward to seeing Letters From Iwo Jima when it comes out on DVD in a few months.  As far as extras go, there are none on this DVD.  If you want to buy it, my suggestion would be to wait for the Director's Cut, or the Special Two-disc Collector's Edition, to come out some time in the next couple of months.  Mr. Eastwood always does a Special Edition of his Oscar nominated films.  Though I'll always see Clint Eastwood as his most famous character, ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, I have to admit to being extremely pleased with how he's done as a director.  This is one man who'll always make your day, if you give him the opportunity.  A great film maker with a great story to tell!",1171497600,,1933,4.384831460674158
2724249,3,B000M4RG4C,"After reading the book of the same name and knowing that Cline Eastwood would be directing the movie, I had hopes for this movie. I do believe that my opinion of the movie was more than a little biased based on the fact that I had read the book previous to seeing the movie. Having the background of the book, the movie clicked much more easily for me. However, if one had not had the advantage of reading the book, this movie would probably be a bit of a disappointment.

The movie is not simply a ""war movie"" in that it is to tell the story of Iwo Jima. The idea behind the movie is to follow the six men who were captured in the now famous photo of the raising of the flag over Iwo Jima. Because of the popularity of that photo, the US War Department used the three surviving men in a very blatant exploitation to sell war bonds.

The major problem with the movie is that it never connects the viewer with the six men the movie is about. This is a real shame because the book spends half the pages going into the backgrounds of each of the six men, from their childhood to their decision to join either the Marines or the Navy. Without this very vital piece of information a huge, very human part of this very touching story is missing. I'm not sure how Eastwood could have done this, but I really feel that more of the backgrounds of the six men should have been included, somehow.

The problem I had with the movie was in the method of telling the story, which is in flashbacks. This can be an effective tool, if used sparingly and used well, but in this movie the story seems to get a bit bogged down - especially if one hasn't read the book and doesn't really understand what is going on.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I think those who read the book will feel the same way. Yet, I don't think that a movie based on a book should require as a pre-requisite that the audience read the book before seeing the movie to fully enjoy the experience. A movie should be able to fully stand on its own.",1171411200,,2004,4.197402597402597
2724250,2,B000M4RG4C,"World War Two was the greatest cause of all time--the elimination of the intolerable Japanese and German militarism and oppression.  This film is about one of the pivotal events in one of the great battles of the Pacific War, and as such, my expectations were high that this would be a film that inspires and inspirits the viewer.  Such is not the case.  The characterizations in this film are one-dimensional, and the problems of the protagonists in dealing with their sudden celebrity as the Iwo Jima flag raisers fail to engage the viewer with other than a consistent depressing downbeat tone.  This is a film that mistakes melancholy for profundity.  The Film simply does not manage to effectively connect the viewer with either the great events of the heroic capture of Iwo Jima by the US Marines, or the problems of the main characters in the aftermath of the battle.

I do not think that it is saying too much that this film loses sight of its main objective: to entertain the viewer.  Instead, it seems determined to focus on the point that the men who became sudden celebrities as the flag raisers were ordinary men, with ordinary flaws in a society that itself was not without flaws.  We know that.  We also know that Iwo Jima was a battle in which such ordinary men performed a fateful service for America and mankind, while asking for nothing in return other than the chance of serving their country and the hope of returning to it intact in mind and body.  Director Clint Eastwood misses this point completely, and what could have been an inspiring and entertaining story instead becomes a fizzle that few viewers will return to a second time.

I understand that Eastwood is making a film that does focus on heroism and patriotism on Iwo Jima--about the Japanese defenders there, if you can believe it.  I think I'll pass that one up.",1171411200,,1847,4.684210526315789

This movie stunned me because I was so terribly bored!  I was not drawn to any character whatsoever, including Ira Hayes, and had trouble staying focused.  I watched it with family members who were also bored by the lack of character attachment and empathy.  I understand how other reviewers did not appreciate the utter cynicism that Eastwood portrayed (I am the son of a WWII vet who was in the Pacific in the end) and would agree with them, except I never actually cared enough about the movie's characters to even be bothered by it.  The awards are baffling, unless you factor in political reasons; much like Bob Dylan not even nominated for Album of the Year by the Grammy's...had he made some anti-war statements he might have been honored.

However, a great movie CAN develop characters in a short two hours, make its point and stick in our memories.

As many prior posters have noted, this movie was a disappointment. I too found the flashback style worked against the film. There was no tension created, and that had the effect of keeping the audience at arm's length from the characters. A clearer narrative style might have helped.

After the gore of SPR and Band of Brothers, the carnage in this film was quite mild, surprisingly so. That's not Clint's fault, but I felt the battle scenes were a bit gratuitous. The great war movies always find a place to show a soldier's disillusionment ON the battlefield. Here, the disillusions were all kept to the dog-n-pony road show.

To me, the movie rang a bit hollow, both on and off the battlefield. To be honest, I feel there's more realism and truth to be found in some of the great episodes from the old Combat! series on TV.

Cast:  Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Adam Beach, John Benjamin Hickey, John Slatterly, Barry Pepper, Jamie Bell, Paul Walker, Robert Patrick.

Running Time: 132 minutes

Rated R for sequences of graphic war violence and carnage, and for language.

Whoever said ""Truth is often the first casualty of war"" must have had ""Flags of Our Fathers"" in mind, the powerful new film from director Clint Eastwood that vividly juxtaposes the reality of the battlefield with the fantasy of the home front.  The movie tells the behind-the-scenes story of the picture-seen-round-the-world, the one showing the Marines raising the American flag triumphantly on Iwo Jima. When that photograph hit the nation's newspapers in early 1945, it provided not only a renewed feeling of hope to a nation weary of war, but a perfect PR opportunity for a government desperate to raise badly needed funds for the (pardon the pun) flagging war effort. Even though it was little known at the time that the photo the world saw was actually of the second raising of the flag (hence, the later charge that the whole thing was staged), the military pulled the three surviving men in the picture off the battlefield so that they could participate in a carefully choreographed, whirlwind tour designed to raise bond money back home. The romantic mythology that sprang up around the event so quickly embedded itself into the American consciousness that these self-described Regular Joes achieved an instant legendary hero status that they were not prepared for psychologically. The film explores the effect all this unlooked-for fame and publicity had on the men at the time and the way in which the label of ""hero"" haunted them for the rest of their lives.

Using James Bradley and Ron Powers' book as his source, scenarist Paul Haggis - whose recent work includes the superb ""Million Dollar Baby"" and the stylishly intelligent ""Crash"" - has written (with co-author William Broyles Jr.) a screenplay that deftly examines the nature of heroism and shows how truth is often sacrificed in the service of patriotism. That is pretty heady stuff in a day and age when charges of treason or at least of not supporting the troops are carelessly hurled at people who so much as question the wisdom of a particular war-related strategy or goal. And it is also surprising coming from a director like Eastwood, long associated with the more conservative elements in Hollywood. Yet, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is a highly patriotic film in that it implies that we honor the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform the most when we adhere to the truth and don't try to manipulate the facts to suit our own purposes, no matter how noble those purposes might be.

The filmmakers have divided the film into three interlocking parts: the first is a brilliantly staged war-is-hell recreation of the island battle; the second documents the bond tour; and the third involves present day interviews with the survivors reflecting back on their experiences.  The battle scenes, which combine amazing CGI effects with sepia-toned photography, have the same stunning force as those in ""Saving Private Ryan."" No less impressive are the performances by a large and gifted cast, including Barry Pepper, Paul Walker and John Benjamin Hickey. In relatively minor roles As the three young men who feel unworthy of the title ""hero,"" Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and especially Adam Beach, as a Native American affectionately referred to as ""Chief,"" turn in superlative work.  As usual, Eastwood knows how to employ images for emotional impact: the combat sequences are brutal and relentless (and given Steven Spielberg produced the film, comparisons with Saving Private Ryan's gut-wrenching opening battle are a bit inevitable), and thanks to the cast's affecting, unpretentious performances (most notably Beach and Barry Pepper, who gives a memorable turn as the platoon leader) the movie never stops being a relevant, powerful piece of work. The only part where the director risks losing the audience's attention (and that's pretty bad, since he hasn't gained it yet) is the slightly confusing beginning, which consists of a series of intertwined flashbacks, which feel pretty pointless considering they're repeated, in their extended form, throughout the film. The other complaint one can come up with is related to the running time: had Eastwood avoided playing certain scenes more than once, the movie would have been more fluid and accessible. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" may not be Eastwood's best picture, but it certainly deserves to be mentioned among the high points of his career, and makes it worth waiting for his companion piece ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", which tells the same story from the Japanese point of view.",1171238400,,4781,5.116666666666666
2724254,4,B000M4RG4C,"I think the above quote, taken from the excellent-yet-disjointed Flags of Our Fathers, is important for two reasons.  First, it accurately encapsulates a lot of what the film tries to convey.  And second, even though I watched the movie twice, I still have no idea who said it.

This latter point either illustrates how convolutedly this movie jumps around or it's just an example of how stupid I am (but I prefer to think it is the former reason).  I believe the line emanates from an older Joe Rosenthal, the photographer who took the famous photo that is the centerpiece for this mostly-compelling drama.  However, in the interest of full disclosure (and also of not being too spoilery), I must admit I don't know for sure.

And ultimately, it doesn't really matter.  Because the most important thing to note is that while I was confused at times, I still found ""Flags"" to be a tremendously strong and moving film.  And from me, that's saying quite a lot, because I usually dislike war movies.

Actually, I think I liked this movie mostly because it's not a conventional ""war movie"" per se (those who are looking for another Saving Private Ryan will, I think, be disappointed).  Rather, this film (along with its cinematic sister, Letters From Iwo Jima, which I just saw), is in fact a study of perception and perspective, of how ""truth"" can be framed and altered (much like a photo) depending upon who is doing the telling.

I believe the biggest challenges or limits inherent in most war films is that we frequently have a tendency to emotionally invest ourselves in whomever we see on screen the most.  And oftentimes, there is too much of a simplistic ""good vs. evil"" style of storytelling. But in this movie (as well as in ""Letters""), director Clint Eastwood doesn't merely paint with a broad brush of black and white but instead colors his canvas with the more grayish tones of which our world seems to consist.

My only gripes with the film (consistent with other reviewers here) are that it jumps around too much (and I usually am an advocate of non-linear cinema) and that we don't get much of a sense of the soldiers' home lives or back stories, even upon their return.  Maybe this was a deliberate maneuver on Clint's part - either to limit the length of an already-long (two hour and twelve minute) film or to temper our usually one-sided investment in the characters.

That said, the performances are all solid, with the standout being Adam Beach as the ultra-reluctant ""hero"" Ira Hayes (""All I did was try not to get shot,"" he laments in one heart-wrenching scene).

This movie is very good on its own, and even better in conjunction with Letters From Iwo Jima.  Like others, I am amazed at how limited this DVD is (not even a chapter menu!), so I would wait to buy the inevitable super-special combo pack of the two films when it arrives.",1171238400,,2856,4.657370517928287
2724255,3,B000M4RG4C,This movie was OK. It was informational as I really didn't know too much about the history behind Iwo Jima so I'll leave it at that.,1171152000,,132,4.115384615384615
2724256,3,B000M4RG4C,"Like many of the previous reviewers, I was expecting to love 'Flags of Our Fathers.' I loved 'Saving Private Ryan' and am fascinated with virtually all things concerning WWII. And while I did find Flags to be relatively moving, I was also disappointed. Firstly, I do think the battle scenes were well done and the realism of war comes off just about as good as 'Saving Private Ryan.' But SPR this is not. Where SPR was unabashedly patriotic(which I have no problem with) Flags is a far more cynical look at the war. It not-so-subtly highlights the use of American propaganda (in the form of that famous picture) to raise money and moral support for the war effort. While this in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing, it is portrayed as a somewhat callous and superficial campaign that often brushes aside the very soldiers that bear the brunt of the sacrifice.

I agree with the other reviewers that the film was a bit disconnected in some places and that there is a lack of character development. With the exception of Ira Hayes, all of the characters are just kind of there, and we don't really get to know anything about them. This includes Ryan Phillippe's character, John ""Doc"" Bradley, who's son wrote the book and for all intents and purposes is the lead character. This is my main criticism of the film. While Eastwood seems to shun the gung-ho patriotism of the collective in favor of showing the personal toll on the individual soldier, he fails to develop any individuality in the soldiers. So needless to say, the film did not have the desired effect. With that said, I did find the ending to be somewhat moving and I feel that this was an honorable attempt at a tribute to our fallen soldiers.

Incidentally, I have come to agree with Eastwood's cynicism regarding our country's treatment of our soldiers. One of things in the film that particularly struck me was how blatantly these soldiers were used and then virtually thrown away as soon as they were no longer needed. One of the more compelling scenes that portrayed this was the one where Private Gagnon can't find a job other than as a janitor after the war. Contrast this to the scene during their fund-raising tour where every businessman in sight was offering ""the hero"" a job. Not to mention the heart-breaking story of Ira Hayes. Many reviewers have critisized this aspect of the film as being too preachy, and while I agree it could have been a little more subtle, I think it is hard to argue that the premise is not essentially true. So while I think that 'Flags of our Fathers' ultimately came up a bit short overall, I think it's heart was in the right place. 3.5 stars.",1171152000,,2657,4.60337552742616

Amazingly confused or saying what the hell?  Because thats what this movie is.  I loved ""LETTERS"" and wanted to love this but the way Eastwood tells the story is horrible.  It jumps back and forth from character to character with reckless abandon.  And by throwing us in without knowing the characters we or at least ""I"" did not care or root for any of the characters.  In ""Letters"" Eastwood gave us time to know the characters and experience what happened to them with them.  In ""Fathers"" we are jerked out of the battle scenes to 3 heroes at home that I don't care about.

You see the problem?  It expects us to care for the characters but they've given us no reason to care about them.  If Eastwood gave us 30 minutes to get to know the charactes and told the story chronologically this could have been a masterpiece.  And in the end I started to get bored with the battle scenes, we know who is going to live, we know the Americans win, and we don't care about the characters.

The actors don't help us either.  There were some bad performances and some alright performances.  Adam Beach probably gave the best showing but  he was just alright.

The good?  Yea there are some great moments, but I'm just ticked because Eastwood had a chance to make something amazing, but instead he screwed everything up.  Overall this is a failure, go see ""Letters"" instead and actually care...",1171152000,,1568,4.461267605633803
2724258,4,B000M4RG4C,"To give a less than shining review of Clint Eastwood's FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is tantamount to being labeled un-American. That is sad because for this viewer the result of the film is not whether or not Eastwood's nonlinear development of a story that bumps and spurts and reflects and meanders and shadows reality lets us get to know the 'heroes' cast in the roles of the three men who survived a single incident in the atrocity of WW II: this is a film that hopefully will be ultimately seen as one of the strongest antiwar statements made to date.

Eastwood does not preach to us, but he rather pulls the curtain back to see the staggering atrocities committed by both camps of soldiers on Iwo Jima - a mirror for every other battle that tore the world apart during WW II - while showing the true venom of the politicians and high mucky mucks back home, those rather insensitive men who elected to create mannequins out of the three men who just happened to be photographed in one of the most infamous photographs of the war and made them sell war bonds, cashing in on emotions to get the big bucks needed to keep the war machine well oiled. That aspect is the more terrifying. As the writers place the words in the mouth of James Bradley: 'Heroes are something we create, something we need. It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us, but for my dad and these men the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies, they may have fought for there country but they died for there friends. For the man in front for the man beside him, and if we wish to truly honor these men we should remember them the way they really were the way my dad remembered them'.

The cast is very good: Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Adam Beach, Barry Pepper, Jaime Bell, Paul Walker, Joseph Cross as the young men and bit parts of the older men played by such luminaries as George Grizzard, Harve Presnell, George Hearn and Len Cariou. The battle photography is staggering and gruesome. No, we never really get to know the true personalities of the boys named as heroes, but having been through a war this viewer can mention that backgrounds and character studies somehow dissolve when young men are thrown into the horror of survival. They were all heroes, whether they survived or not. Eastwood is asking us to look at the heinous futility of war and the depersonalization war causes - except in the tortured memories of those who come home.

2724262,2,B000M4RG4C,"As a fan of both Clint Eastwood as director, and WWII movies of any kind, it saddens me deeply to have to award this film such a low rating. But I simply cannot recommend it by any stretch.

I'll just jump right in by pointing out the films two main flaws:

#1 - the film is presented in a time-shifting manner (think PULP FICTION) that renders the material confusing and ultimately uninvolving.  There are at least four seperate time periods (the present, the first day of the invasion, a subsequent night of the invasion, and the tour back in the States of the surviving flag-raisers).  The film constantly jumps between these four time periods in random order with rarely a time-stamp to let you know where you are.  And the shifts often come right in the middle of a scene, which adds to the jarring nature.  I suppose Eastwood figured the audience would stay more engaged if the war footage was peppered throughout the film instead of concentrated at the beginning.  But this approach ultimately sacrificed the impact of the story - which leads me to point . . .

#2 - there is no emotional connection to this story or its characters.  Because we jump all around and see them at different phases of the story without understanding how they got from one point to the next, we become detached from their emotional development, and cease to care about them.  Ira, the Native American soldier, is supposed to elicit our sympathy, but he comes off as a whining drunken baby.  Doc is supposed to be our solid hero, but he comes off as a cardboard everyman who seems to spend more time staring at the scenery than letting us into his mind.  And Gagnon, after shouldering the responsibility of compiling the list of who actually raised the flag, he simply becomes window dressing as ""the one with the girlfriend who gets married.""  None of these characters draw any interest because we never get to spend any consistent time with them.

And the same goes for every other character in the movie.  There are extended sequences of soldier after soldier falling to the battlefield in the throes of death while one of the three look on and hold their hands . . . and we are supposed to care about this, I suppose, only I never knew who was dying because I had never been given any information about their characters.  So, it became just a cavalcade of anonymous dying soldiers.  It's hard to sell a ""War is Hell"" bit when no one cares about these people.

Personally, I wish Eastwood, or those who adapted the novel, had just taken the traditional route of following these men from early training through the full invasion for about an hour and a half, and then sequentially proceeded to the American tour of the three survivors.  THEN I would have had an emotional interest in seeing how the horrors of what they endured were turned into a marketing campaign to promote the war to America (which is the film's core message).

Simply put, the time shifting kills the movie and its message.  Because so many of what should be the emotionally climactic moments occur early in the film when the viewer still doesn't know the characters, there is no reason for the viewer to care.

Adding to the confusion is the ever-changing narrarators.  First we see an old man collapse and another young man helping him.  This young man turns out to be his son (which I didn't realize until nearly the end, thanks to shoddy storytelling) who apparently goes about interviewing others in his dad's squad.  As such, throughout the film, we hear the story told by several of the old men, and finally by the son. Once again, seeing the story told by changing points of view causes detachment from any one of the characters.

But I digress.  Let's talk about the comparison this film will undoubtedly, and appropriately draw to another great war epic, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Simply put, the war footage in this film doesn't even hold a candle to RYAN.  For whatever reason, the effects of this film just scream CGI, with the image being a little too crisp and clean, and I was too often reminded of LORD OF THE RINGS rather than archival WWII footage.  With RYAN, Spielberg did a fantastic job of taking you from the boat to the beach-head, to the hill, to the bunker, and to the top, and you knew exactly where you were on that beach the whole time.  The invasion in this film is just a confusing mess.  Shot after shot of mortars firing and holes erupting dirt on the beach while men fly through the air.  Shot after shot of bullets ripping through the dirt and just catching a soldier.  Tons of generic soldiers holding their gut in, or lying in a lifeless heap.  But with all of this, no sense of where they are going, what they are accomplishing, and who is being affected.  Intercut with this are several shots from the perspective of straffing U.S. airplanes, but yet again we do not see the pilots of these planes, only the view out their windows.  These shots, like the rest, seem completely superfluous, and merely put in to show off the latest CGI effects.

In fact, another recent film has stolen the thunder of such war footage as well.  While not a World War epic, CHILDREN OF MEN ended with a spectacular single-take run through a war ravaged tenament building with guns blazing and tanks firing, bringing the character immediately into the fray, something which FLAGS simply does not do.

So, with generically bland footage, uninvolving characters and dialogue, and jarring time-skipping, there is just no reason for you to spend your time with this film.  As I say in the title, you can honestly gain the entire story from the trailer.  All the scenes that explain the purpose of the film (that these three became unwitting hero-symbols in the effort to garner support for the war) are in the trailer, and are not expounded on in any way in the movie.

Hopefully, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA will provide a better emotional journey than this disjointed effort.",1170979200,,5941,4.623450905624404

Their naivete soon turns to horror as they walk into the realties of war, shown in bloody detail in this movie.  When victory seems assured, some of the men are ordered to put up the American flag as a symbol of capturing the island.  A politician wants the original flag, so another one is put up in its place.  There is confusion, men are killed, and there is some uncertainty as to who raised the two flags.  One of the men is asked to name those who participated in the flag-raising and when he does so, they are whisked back to the US to help sell war bonds.  The war scenes are vivid and horrifying in their realty, but they are juxtaposed with a somewhat stereotypical depiction of the men returning to the US and feeling guilty about leaving their buddies behind and being honored as ""heroes"" while they feel that those who fell in the battle are the real heroes.  Exploitation, racism, and opportunism are all shown to be as ugly as the battle scenes themselves.  Although there are many strengths in this movie, the action switches back and forth from the battlefield to the US tour and sometimes causes confusion.  Also the viewer never gets to know most of the characters well enough to know and care about what happens to them.

2724265,3,B000M4RG4C,"First off let me say that I'm a Clint Eastwood fan and I was actually entertained by this movie (it's flaws not withstanding). My title statement was in reference purly to the DVD. There are no special features on this disc at all. I mean none, not even scene selection. It's probably the cheapest lamest DVD I've ever bought.

Now about the movie, this movie is not as bad as most people on here are suggesting, although it's not nearly the masterpiece that critics would have you believe. My biggest grip with the film is the pacing and editing of the story. It's told in flashback (which is really a flashback withing a flashback). It never really gives you time to get into a scene before it jumps into a different time/part of the story. Also, the character development was rather lacking. Other than that, it was pretty good  because the cinematography, dialoge, and acting were all A+. It would have been more entertaining and worthwile if the story was told from a more linear point of view.

If you really want to see it, either rent it or wait for the Extended/Ultra/5-Star/Directors Cut/Special Edition money raping DVD.",1170979200,,1131,4.702020202020202
2724266,3,B000M4RG4C,"Separating entertainment from history will be the toughest thing to do during this little film review, but we're going to do it because entertainment is what films are all about, right? Whether it's entertaining in a teaching manner or on a more visceral level is up to the director/screenwriter. But as the audience, our only need is to feel as though our time sitting in front of the big screen has been worthwhile.

Some are going to lambaste me for saying things here but I'm going to risk ridicule and say them anyway. But first, the positives...

The cinematography is excellent. The muted sepia tones on Iwo Jima and the flashbacks that all the characters have are all pulled off exceptionally well. Also, the story is significant in that the ""true"" heroes of Iwo Jima are never recognized, and Mr. Eastwood deserves thanks for pointing out this historical flaw. The sweeping views of the American Navy as it approaches Iwo are just flat-out stunning, too, reminiscent of the scenes from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (although that landing took place in France, not the Pacific Theater).

Historically the story is very interesting, too, showing how Americans went bonkers over one image that they viewed as the U.S.'s ultimate success in the war. The media and politicians appropriately locked onto this and used it to help promote the sale of war bonds. And this is where our characters come in ...and where we start to run into problems.

With the exception of Ira Hayes (played well by Adam Beach) and maybe John ""Doc"" Bradley (played by Ryan Phillippe), the characters in the film are distantly portrayed, never really getting the audience on the inside of the rest of the main characters. Barry Pepper (who I absolutely love as an actor) was one of the many die-offs that I just couldn't connect with. As were Jesse Bradford (although not a die-off), John Benjamin Hickey, and even Paul Walker (who played Hank Hansen, a fairly pivotal person in the story). I realize that these were real men, not fictional creations, but the audience still needs a significant connection in order to empathize with them. It just wasn't there. Again, the exception to this was Adam Beach who's well-played role of the unfortunate Ira Hayes comes off quite well. His unfortunate death proves that Native Americans were seen as second class citizens even though they were fighting in the war and killed alongside every other color of men.

Perhaps LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is a better Eastwood film. Maybe not. Regardless, I'm now just a bit hesitant to see it for fear of not connecting with any of those characters either.",1170979200,,2607,4.849438202247191

Eastwood has taken his feelings about the war in Iraq and imposed them on a heroic struggle that happened 60 years ago. I feel bad for the Americans who fought and died on Iwo Jima, this film cheapens and de-legitmizes their experience.

2724281,5,B000M4RG4C,"Academy Award-winning director Clint Easwood and Steven Spielberg have combined their talents to produce a masterpiece of a film about one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific war: Iwo Jima.  Iwo Jima was important strategically for the United States because of its close proximity to Japan, being only 600 miles from Tokyo.  Iwo Jima was to be used as an advanced fighter base as well as an emergency landing field for crippled B-29 bombers returning from bombing Japan.  But first, the island had to be taken.

Ryan Phillippe stars as Navy corpsman John ""Doc"" Bradley.  He, along with Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), Ira Hayes (Adam Beach), Mike Strank (Barry Pepper), Harlan Block (Benjamin Walker), and Franklin Sousley (Joseph Cross) would soon become famous for appearing in the most recgonizable photograph ever taken; Joe Rosenthal's famous shot of the second flag raising over Iwo Jima.

Eastwood does a marvelous job of describing the battle through the eyes of Bradley.  The battle scenes are extremely realistic and the description of the lives of the surviving flag-raisers is told in a poignant yet factual manner.  Mike Strank, Harlon Block, and Franklin Sousley were eventually killed later in the battle, leaving Bradley, Hayes, and Gagnon as survivors.  They were immediately pulled off the island and sent back to the United States to appear in bond rallies across the country.

Hayes didn't want to leave the island, instead preferring to remain with his fellow Marines.  He battled alcohol while constantly dealing with being called a hero.  He felt that the real heroes died in battle, and he was merely a survivor.  His battles with alcohol eventually led to him being shipped back to combat. He battled alcoholism for the rest of his life while landing in and out of jail.  He died of exposure to the outside elements.

Gagnon loved the spotlight and all of the fame and attention.  He constantly rubbed shoulders with politicians and businessmen.  He was promised numerous jobs along the way, but none ever materialized.  He made a living as a janitor.

Bradley was somewhat in the middle of the two extremes set by Hayes and Gagnon.  He seemed to like the attention, but he as well realized that the true heroes died in battle.  He often played peacemaker between Gagnon and Hayes, and he helped Hayes through his battles with alcohol.  He returned home after the war, married his girlfriend, and purchased a funeral home, where he made his living.

This is one of the best war movies I've seen.  The story is excellent, and Eastwood does a magnificent job of intertwining the battle sequences with the story of the surviving flag-raisers and the bond tour.  Several times during the movie, there is a flashback to the combat on Iwo Jima, and these flashbacks help the viewer understand what the characters are thinking.  The acting, especially by Jesse Bradford, Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach, and Barry Pepper is first-rate.

I give this fine movie my highest recommendation.  Uncommon valor was a common virtue among the Marines and sailors on Iwo Jima, and this movie definitely shows that aspect.  Watch and see how six men who, in their innocence, changed the world forever.",1170806400,,3204,4.969924812030075

2724283,3,B000M4RG4C,"War movies are strange since people almost never seem to want to criticize them in any form, as it's deemed ""unpatriotic"". It's also strange that these kind of films usually offer me little attachment. Yeah, war is hell and soldiers did and saw things that I'd probably never in my lifetime see; yet at the same time it's hard to invest in character that usually aren't given that much emotions to utilize. And so we have Flags of Our Fathers, directed by Clint Eastwood, and filmed back-to-back with Letters from Iwo Jima, which tells of the Japanese side of the battle. Is Flags a great war movie or just the lesser half of a whole?

The film centers around the iconic photograph taken during the battle on the island of Iwo Jima in 1945. The photograph however, was the 2nd one taken, since a politician wanted the original as a souvenir and a replacement had to be used. That photograph made it to print all over America and became a huge sensation to the point where 3 men: John ""Doc"" Bradley, Ira Hayes and Rene Gagnon (since the other 3 died during the battle) are sent home on a tour to promote the idea of buying bonds and fund the war. Of course there's more to it than that as restrictions are placed on the men, demands have to be met and any of them not met results in the man being sent back into war. The men conflict as they're being called heroes simply for raising a flag while everyone else is fighting the good fight.

Apparently Letters is meant to be the more straight forward of the 2 since Flags is very ambitious. From the battle scenes to the re-creation of events, it's certainly an admirable picture to like since there's so much attention to detail on screen. The problem is, and it's possibly a poor man's Tarantino or something, but the film just can't seem to sit still. We follow one event, flash back to the war, and at a certain point we'll see the first event just before it happens then later we'll see the same event before the one before it which came later. Confused? It's better explained in the film and even then it's unnecessary. Do we have to flashback before an event then see the events leading up to the event in such a jumbled manner? Doubt.

Acting-wise it seems filled to the brim with recognizable talent. From Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Robert Patrick, Barry Pepper or Jamie Bell, you get the feeling that everyone in the film has that ""now where did I see that guy before?"" aura. However, we're not given much on their story and there's this weird kind of emotional severing we feel, which we shouldn't since this is war but you never really get intimate with the characters even though we spend a lot of time with them. The only 2 that I really thought about was Ira Hayes and another soldier played by Jamie Bell. The former realizes right away the publicity is unwarranted and as a result he develops a drinking problem which worses his post-traumatic stress disorder. The latter we never see his outcome but reading up on it you'll find one of the worst cases of torture I've ever seen.

Nothing is worse for a DVD fan than the words ""double dip"". In some cases they're necessary since the original DVD was so crappy they had to make a new one (Seven or Titanic) but in other cases it's basically a knowing cash-grab: release a movie with little to no extras then a few months later release it again but packed to the brim with stuff (Day After Tomorrow, Man on Fire). This? It's only other feature is ""Setup"" which changes the audio settings. That's it. Not one single EPK back-patting feature? Nope. Expect a 2-disc edition somewhere down the line, most likely an extended edition with even more stuff.

Should you buy it? Even if you were a fan, I'd say no if you like all the bonus features. But should you watch? Sure, there's enough reason to but not enough to recommend to anyone that it's THE film to see.",1170720000,,3876,4.468926553672317

This is as true a depiction of the incident that occurred on Mount Suribachi, on the island of Iwo Jima, 1945, as Hollywood is ever lightly to achieve. One, the 1949 ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" with John Wayne, using much of the footage shot during the actual battle by Marine cameramen, may come Hollywood close to telling the story of combat Marines in the Pacific.

In response to some previous reviews, this was not supposed to be a typical Hollywood view of war. ""Heroes"" did not jump off the screen, nor were they supposed to. These were Marines who had a job to do. A very small part of that job was raising a flag on top of Mount Suribachi. Hollywood, the media and the political money-grubbers got hold of an accidental photo and ran with it to raise money. The surviving flag raisers were used to that end. That's the story. Not the individuals, per s.

As one character said early in the movie, the loudest screams, or whatever, will come from those who never saw combat. Being a movie ""aficionado"" does not make anyone capable of understanding combat unless you have been there.

That said, this movie was, I believe, produced with reverence and humility, showing the very nature of the Marine Corps, that ""Uncommon Valor was a Common Virtue."" I don't expect civilians to comprehend that, but there it is. Although the ""characters"" may not have been fleshed out enough for some ""movie aficionados"", the movie showed the story of the men who raised the flag, two of whom were eventually destroyed by their fame. Obviously, Navy Corpsman, ""Doc"" Bradley, managed to remove himself from the limelight and get on with his life, never mentioning the fact that he had earned the Navy Cross, this country's second highest combat award, even to his own family. As the characters and real men said, they were NOT the heroes of Iwo Jima. The heroes were still on that island - dead.

Just to appease ""aficionados"", etc, there were several minor technical issues I had with the movie. Some web gear used was Viet Nam era, not WW II. Language: On a ship or on land, Marines and sailors never say ""door"". The word is ""HATCH"". This is in no way a racist comment, but there were no black Americans in the Marine Corps until the 1950s, although the movie showed what appear to be several black Marines at a briefing on the ship, prior to the in itial landing. I'm sure this was a Hollywood PC moment, but it was not correct. Just for emphasis, the only color in the Marine Corps is combat green. In other words a Marine is a Marine. Period.

The movie is excellent and well produced, and well worth seeing, even if you are a civilian ""movie aficionado"". But I suggest others don't pay attention to self-styled ""aficionados"", who know precious little about the content of this movie in particular and what Eastwood was doing.",1170633600,,3031,4.593345656192237

2724305,5,B000M4RG4C,"Sadly, Flags of Our Fathers did not get the expected welcome and enthusiasm in 2006. For those of us who were fortunate to see the film in the cinema, we were lucky to experience something everybody else had missed in the movie experience. The film is beautifully shot, written, and acted. I don't know what people expected but I read the book long before seeing the film. It is a visual masterpiece! You feel like you are there in war with the cast members. Ryan Phillipe was fine as James Bradley, the mortician, whose son would write about the picture. Adam Beach was unforgettable as Ira Hayes, the Native American soldier, who was so traumatized by the war experience that he died only years later. The actor who played Rene Gagnon also did a superb job and was my favorite. Melanie Lynskey had a small role as his wife. Myra Turley also had her best performance to date as a soldier's mother as did Judith Ivey. First, the film was adapted from the book and didn't lose that touch that the author had allowed us to see. The movie recreated a world that most of us didn't live through. The film allowed us to see and appreciate what three ordinary men went through. They detailed about the tour of the flag raisers as celebrities and heroes rather than ordinary people. I remember Rene calling people for a job. Ira giving a speech at a Native Americans Congress. James probably had put that part of his life behind him. You have to remember that James, Ira, and Rene did not want to be part of the campaign for war bonds. Ira was the most resistant and his life was the most tragic. The film does not go into Ira's family background or the losses of his siblings. It was painful watching a car stop with a family who took a photo with Ira in the fields. Ira had the most guilt over the war. Rene and James had moved on with their lives and married but the legacy of a photo that changed American attitude towards a war that most of us are connected to whether we like it or not. This film was released in movie theaters as the photographer Joe Rosenthal died. I hoped that he saw it and gave it his blessing. Still, I thought it would be a shoe-in for the Oscars but I guess people are just put off by war even one that happened years ago.",1170460800,,2245,4.334916864608076

2724307,5,B000M4RG4C,"I'm sick of people trying to compare this movie with Saving Private Ryan.  They aren't even close enough or have enough similarities between them to compare. Saving Private Ryan was a flat-out action movie, and the character development wasn't as good as this. Don't get me wrong, Saving Private Ryan was one of my favorites, but in my opinion, Flags is better.

Flags of our Fathers is much more of a drama, and the battle scenes are stretched out in the movie, and when they do show themselves, they are brief, yet action-packed.  Since Spielberg had a hand in the movie, the characteristic color-desaturation is apparent throughout the film.  The effects are very good, and I got chills when they showed Suribachi being shelled from afar.

The character story is very deep in Flags, and you truly feel for each soldier that the movie focuses upon. Ira Hayes, played by Adam Beach, steals the show with his incredibly haunting performance.  Never in this movie did I become bored. But as for you war-movie fans who only want blood and violence, this one will probably disappoint you, although its action scenes were done extremely well.

The majority of the movie is after the three surviving flag-raisers are taken home to take part in a bond-drive. The actual war-scenes are random flashbacks throughout the movie. The rest of the movie that hasn't been mentioned takes place before James Bradley wrote the book on which the movie was based.  He is interviewing his father and such, and these scenes are quite a small percentage of the overall film, but very emotional.

Overall, this movie is one of the top films I've ever seen, and Clint's companion, Letters from Iwo Jima, was equally impressive. I was upset when Clint didn't get a best director bid for flags, but Letters is up for ""best film,"" so I was ok.

  Perhaps then we can come to understand that when it's all said and done, the politician takes over what they started...and the men who were uprooted and displaced do indeed have to fight endless inner demons.

Makes me wonder if the same thing is going on in Iraq. We have many brave boys dying, but what about the other side? They should be honored as well.

Adam Beach(Ira Hayes) was okay in the crying scene, nowhere else.  Ex-Mr Reese Witherspoon(James Bradley)was wooden all the way through.  Although from the book, he was reserved most of his life.

The movie did not take the same approach as the book, which is where it fails miserably.  The movie chronology is where the biggest mistake was made.  The actor playing the author(was it him?) in the end did not go with the tone again.  Too bad.  I like all things Clint, don't get me wrong, but Spielberg should have done this one, even if it was going to be compared to Saving Private Ryan.

2724315,5,B000M4RG4C,"Clint Eastwood has proven himself (if there was ever any doubt after Million Dollar Baby) to be a master filmmaker.  With Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby under his belt (2 bonafide masterpieces), one wondered how he would top them.  His answer was to direct not only one but TWO films about WWII (the other being Letters from Iwo Jima).  This film generally got mixed reviews from critics, and many were disappointed.  I wasn't.  I think this is a magnificent film, truthful, sad, cynical, heartbreaking, and yet, somehow uplifting in some ways.  It centers on the offical lies about the famous Iwo Jima photograph.  We find out the exact circumstances as to why this photo was rendered, and we find out on the 3 servicemen who were exploited by the Roosevelt Administration (showing that exploiting servicemen is a bipartisan enterprise) and how they were pretty much jettisoned after the government had no further use for them.  In many Eastwood films, there are a few bad performances in the minor roles.  Here that isn't the case.  The trio of lead actors, Adam Beach, Ryan Phillipe, and Jesse Bradford, are superb.  There isn't a false note or performance in the entire film.  One of the best aspects about this film is how it's edited.  The film has graphic war footage, but it's interpersed in the film in an interesting way.  The war footage, unlike other overly graphic war films like Saving Private Ryan, doesn't revel in its cruelty.  It's there to move the film along.  This film also really gives you a sense of the battle for Iwo Jima.  You see the military strategy in how they take the island, painful step by painful step.  The military people here are not the stupid, gung ho types that often are portrayed in Hollywood films.  They are much more down to earth and real.  Regardless about your feelings about war and the cause of, you can't help but feel for all soldiers after seeing this film (and its companion Letters).  The ending of this film is one of the more beautiful that I've seen.  It flashes back to a rather simple scene that ends up being unexpectedly poignant.

2724317,4,B000M4RG4C,"Iwo Jima (""Sulfur Island"" in Japanese) is a little island six hundred miles south of Tokyo. (Today there is only a Japanese military base now, and you cannot visit the island.) But the name of the island got famous immediately after one photo was taken and published in America nationwide during WWII. The memorable image of six soldiers raising a flag gave courage to the people in America, and three surviving soldiers returning their country became national heroes. It's a famous story.

Clint Eastwood's new film `Flags of Our Fathers' does not try to `debunk' this story. It gives human face to these flag-holing soldiers without over-glorifying them, showing what happened to these heroes John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) before, during, and after the Battle of Iwo Jima. Familiar actors like Jamie Bell, Paul Walker, Robert Patrick and Barry Pepper appear, but the three above play the pivotal roles here.

Remember this is a war movie, and the battle scenes on the beach are often disturbing. (One of the film's producers is Steven Spielberg). Though the fight scenes are less bloody and brutal than those of `Saving Private Ryan,' they are still honest, often shocking, not only because of the bullets and grenades, but because of the confusion and total chaos of the grey-colored battlefield. Eastwood refuses to soften or sensationalize anything, but the results are riveting.

Though the film's theme is clear, its narrative requires our patience a little. The film's story goes back and forth (screenplay part done by Paul Haggis, `Crush'), and this only makes the film look slightly detached from us. The disjointed story requires us to reconstruct, not follow, the experiences of the soldiers. The emotions are certainly there on the screen (thanks to the effective acting), but I am not sure that this is the best way to visualize them. But as I said, the three actors did a fine job as three soldiers who travel around the country for Bond rallies where they have to face another reality during wartime - they are war heroes and people expect them to behave as such.

Finally, some people, not without good reason, say this film is dull. It is true that Eastwood's films tend to be slow, and he takes time to show certain things about the characters. He avoids melodramatic storytelling and showy camerawork, and that does not change in this film. If the battle scenes look confusing, it is perhaps because the war is confusing. If the descirtios of their life as war hero look boring, that is because it is really boring; they were required to do the same thing again and again before finally being forgotten. We just share their feeling, but perhaps too much of it.

This is Clint Eastwood's most ambitious film (and there is ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" still waiting), and maybe too ambitious as far as its screenplay is concerned. I am impressed with the film, however, with the sincere message from the director who realized the one of the saddest events in history for both people in America and Japan with his touch subtle and powerful at the same time.",1166140800,,3133,4.870544090056285

2724319,5,B000M4RG4C,"This was a different film from what I expected. Perhaps because I am a big fan of Band of Brothers, one of the best series ever produced, at least in my opinion, and this was very different.

I found Flags of our Fathers to be slower paced, and thought provoking, although the war scenes were no less gory and terrible. But what was most fascinating was the juxtaposition of everyday normal life back home against the horrors of Iwo Jima. To me the duality of the film with the heroes of Iwo Jima touring the country while their fellow soldiers died in battle was extremely poignant. The breakout performance is that of Adam Beach who plays the tortured Native American Indian soldier living in guilt for surviving while his friends all died. A truly moving performance.

Apparently Mr. Eastwood has also directed a Japanese version of Iwo Jima, meant to be a companion piece to this film. Shot all in Japanese and telling the other side of the story, starring Ken Watanabe. I'm not sure when the US release will be but I will be anxious to see it.

For anyone who hasn't read the book, I urge you to do so. It is an excellent book that delves deeper into the lives of these soldiers and is a wonderful tribute by a son for his father.",1164067200,,1235,4.431718061674009
2724320,2,B000M4RG4C,"The film is about two things. The first is the invasion of Iwo Jima by the US in 1945. The other is about a campaign by three of the veterans of the campaign to raise money by the selling of government bonds to support the war effort.

The campaign to raise money (although not mentioned in the film) was a big success and raised double the anticipated returns. The three service personnel who participated in it thus provided a greater service to their country than they did by their actions on Iwo Jima. However rather than appreciating the utility of their actions in selling bonds the three are tormented by guilt. (Or at least two are, one is grateful to be out of there) The problem is survivor guilt. A phenomenon in war in which those who are spared death initially feel a surge of elation but then are tormented by the fact that they have let their comrades down and their continual survival is a burden. The problems in this case are worsened by the fact that the three serviceman have been chosen as ""heroes"" because they were in a picture taken of a flag being raised rather than for anything they did on the battlefield. However the public at home does not really understand this and the three servicemen not only feel guilt at their survival but they also feel that their being portrayed as heroes is something of a fraud.

The film is being sold as an essay on heroism. However it is not really that it is something else. The campaign to take Iwo Jima was probably a waste of time. The initial reason was to use Iwo Jima as a base to fly fighters off to support the fire raids on Japan. However fighter support was not needed for the Superfortress Bombers as the Japanese kept their remaining fighters grounded hoping to use them as Kamikaze plains when the US invaded the main land.  Later Iwo was used as a landing point for damaged bombers but this was never raised as a rationalisation for the invasion during the planning phase.

In reality Iwo Jima was the most successful defensive battle the Japanese fought against Americans in the later part of the war and it is the one time that they were able to inflict greater casualties than they received. Broadly 20,000 Japanese troops dug themselves in to a complicated system of trenches, tunnels and pill boxes and fought to the death against an invading force of 40,000 marines. The Japanese had no chance of victory, they were not re-supplied during the battle and they kept fighting even after they ran out of water and food. A tiny number surrendered after most died fighting or killed themselves. The Americans initially thought that they could win reasonably easily as they had been bombing and shelling the Island for months and thought that their fire superiority would quell any resistance. Instead the battle dragged on for 35 days.

The film gives a good idea of the horror faced by the Marines as they faced a tough well trained and fanatical enemy determined to hold out to the last. It is no surprise that the horror of the battle had such a traumatic effect on the three servicemen who are the main focus of the film. However the film is not so much about heroism. The ""heroes"" of this battle were surely the Japanese. Outnumbered little ammunition no hope of victory facing an enemy twice as strong backed by a huge fleet and massive air support. The Japanese never thought of giving in but fought it out to the last. Of course heroism is a rather overrated virtue. Whilst the Japanese were heroic no one would want them to win as they were also barbarous and fighting for the establishment of imperial system based on racial slavery.

The one's you want to win are the Americans even if they are not brave or heroic in the traditional sense. That is because in this fight at least they were fighting for the sorts of values we all hold as true.

The film seems to accept that the Iwo campaign had some point. (It accepts the rationalisation used after the victory of the use of the Island as a re-fulling and repair station) In reality of course the campaign had no point and the irony is that the thee servicemen who went around and sold bonds did more for the war effort than all those who died so pointlessly.",1163808000,,4198,4.530343007915567
2724321,5,B000M4RG4C,"This may be the most outstanding movie dealing with war since The Best year's of Our Lives. I compare it to that because they are both about men experiencing war and confronting coming home. I sit here two days after seeing Flags of Our Fathers and it still resonates within me. It isn't a conventional story arc like Saving Private Ryan and it has a higher bar to clear to convincingly express deeper, more complex themes. Some of the more cynical critics only see it as a rehash of the simple theme that war is hell. Undoubtably, this is one of the themes since Iwo Jima was as hellish as they come. But Eastwood succeeds in much more than that. Never have I seen a more compelling style bringing the viewer to grips with something they can never truly understand without being there. No one is patronized, canonized, or stereotyped, only humanized without sentimentality or simplification. Eastwood is a mature master, and possibly the only current director capable of authentically examining the human soul. I haven't seen any other movie this year on this level. Too bad they probably won't give him back to back Best Director and Best Picture awards, but he deserves it. Best Adapted Screenplay and Cinematography should also go to this picture. Most of all, Adam Beach should get Best Actor for his portrayal of Ira Hayes. If you don't read the book before seeing it, I recommend you at least google the story James Bradley told at the Iwo Jima Memorial to some tourists.

2724322,4,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags of Our Fathers"" is like so many studio prestige films, in that it is a good, possibly even great, film that could still have been so much more. The film is a success on so many levels that it will probably easily be one of the finest of the year. At its best it impressively brings a certain amount of originality and perspective to its oft filmed subject matter, asking questions and providing insights to common notions of history and its mediation. At its worst the film is a perfect example of everything it purports to decry. Eastwood's talent as a director has certainly been peaking as of late, and this film is yet another feather in his cap, but for all it does right the film still far short of all it could have been.

I don't wish to be disparaging. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is a great film. Go see it. It handles its material in an expert fashion, and for all its ties to such an overworked genre it obviously aspires to use the best of the genre while calling attention to its common failures. One way it achieves this is through a breaking up of the narrative of the film. Rejecting the linear narrative of the common war movie, Eastwood tells his story by inter-cutting scenes of post-war, war, and even present day, and by doing so disparages the claims to `reality' that a linear narrative naturally breeds. Much of the film centres around the battle on Iwo Jima, but an equal amount is given to scenes of the soldiers after the war, five to ten years later, in the present day, etc. What this achieves is a commitment of the film to truly tell the tale of the soldiers involved and not merely use this noble endeavour as an excuse to put out a two hour action movie. The war scenes are here and they are perhaps the goriest seen yet, but due in part to this fractured narrative, and to the particular cinematic traits of these scenes, they never come across as exploitative or unnecessary.

One of the film's triumphs is the way in which it questions history and its ongoing mediation. Was the famous flag raising photo from Iwo Jima staged? Who was in the photo, and why the discrepancy over this? The film asks many questions about the validity of mediated history, whether through media, photography, writing etc. We see that history is always written by the victors and often by those with something to sell along with it. We also see the victims of this process through a Native American character who is used when necessary and tossed aside when not. We see also the damage done to friends, family, lover, basically actual people, by this all powerful, ultimately fictional, notion of `history'. Along with history the film also dissuades the figure of the war hero, of the glorification of war and those who fight it, and does so far more successfully than the many other films that claim to. For ultimately this glorification is yet another meditation of an event, of a situation and experience that can never be truly captured or expressed through mediation. One can try, and maybe even should, but when the meditation, the fiction, becomes reality the results, as ""Flags of Our Fathers"" claims, can become destructive.

With all this said, my one big complaint with the film is that it is in many ways everything it claims to oppose. The mediation of war is a main concern of the film, and yet the film never seems to question its own position. It is, after all, a movie, one of the most manipulative of mediums available. The film, if not exactly always condemning, still questions the use of an inexpressible experience (the horrors of war) for the purposes of expression. Eastwood may be telling us that to exploit war for the means of finance or easy consumption is a slippery slope, and yet I, like everyone else in the theatre, paid my admission fee to have Eastwood tell me this and try to better understand war. The narrative may be broken up, but the form of the film is not questioned enough to add true legitimacy to the film's criticism of mediation. The film has a narrative and a definite claim to `realism' and authority, and this compromises any claims it makes to the contrary. With this the film becomes, like so many others of its kind, outwardly critical and yet in many ways a part of the problem. Challenging enough to make `conscientious' films goers feel smart and self-righteous, and yet still safe enough to be nominated for Oscars.

So yes, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is great but I still found its shortcomings frustrating. I like that it tried to be something above typical, and yet lament that it fell short. As a Hollywood war film it is probably one of the best that can be made. As a post-modern challenge to the meditation and exploitation of history, something which was obvious attempted, it never quite hits the mark. But at least it tries, which is more than can be said for the majority of the genre. I look forward to Eastwood's follow up to this movie, taking the Japanese point of view, and hope it to be as interesting and enjoyable as this.",1163289600,,5014,4.567777777777778
2724323,5,B000M4RG4C,"Without the benefit of having seen this film, it would be very easy to condemn it is a blood and guts war movie.  This would be grossly unfair.  Sure there is extended action involving some grisly scenes, but the film has much more to offer.  This film is not gory so much as touching and poignant.  It is a must see film.

As Clint Eastwood has evolved into a director later in his career, he has shown his remarkable depth of talent.  He is no longer the spaghetti western star.  Rather, he is now a brilliant and thought provoking creator of great films.  ""Flags of our Fathers"" certainly falls into this category.

It would have been simple to create a simple war film where good fights evil and, in the end, the good guys win.  This is probably the typical Hollywood script.  Eastwood has not opted for such a ho hum approach.  Instead, he has crafted a film that asks many questions and invites the viewer to reach his or her own conclusions.  The film is full of ambiguities.

The essence of the story is simple.  The US invasion of Iwo Jima is the backdrop to the story of the famous photograph of a group of marines raising a flag on the top of Mount Suribachi.  It is a totemic photograph that has been reproduced countless times and seen by most western people.  The act was incidental to a great and significant battle in World War II.  However, the subsequent story of those surviving men who raised the flag is a much less well known than the photograph itself.  Eastwood tells the story and tells it brilliantly.

Make an effort.  Go see this film!",1163289600,,1563,4.433098591549296

Whoever said ""Truth is often the first casualty of war"" must have had ""Flags of Our Fathers"" in mind, the powerful new film from director Clint Eastwood that vividly juxtaposes the reality of the battlefield with the fantasy of the home front.

The movie tells the behind-the-scenes story of the picture-seen-round-the-world, the one showing the Marines raising the American flag triumphantly on Iwo Jima.  When that photograph hit the nation's newspapers in early 1945, it provided not only a renewed feeling of hope to a nation weary of war, but a perfect PR opportunity for a government desperate to raise badly needed funds for the (pardon the pun) flagging war effort.  Even though it was little known at the time that the photo the world saw was actually of the SECOND raising of the flag (hence, the later charge that the whole thing was staged), the military pulled the three surviving men in the picture off the battlefield so that they could participate in a carefully choreographed, whirlwind tour designed to raise bond money back home.  The romantic mythology that sprang up around the event so quickly embedded itself into the American consciousness that these self-described Regular Joes achieved an instant legendary hero status that they were not prepared for psychologically.  The film explores the effect all this unlooked-for fame and publicity had on the men at the time and the way in which the label of ""hero"" haunted them for the rest of their lives.

Using James Bradley and Ron Powers` book as his source, scenarist Paul Haggis - whose work ranges from the sublime ""Million Dollar Baby"" to the godawful ""Crash"" - has written (with co-author William Broyles Jr.) a screenplay that deftly examines the nature of heroism and shows how truth is often sacrificed in the service of patriotism.  That is pretty heady stuff in a day and age when charges of treason or at least of not supporting the troops are carelessly hurled at people who so much as question the wisdom of a particular war-related strategy or goal.  And it is also surprising coming from a director like Eastwood, long associated with the more conservative elements in Hollywood.  Yet, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is a highly patriotic film in that it implies that we honor the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform the most when we adhere to the truth and don't try to manipulate the facts to suit our own purposes, no matter how noble those purposes might be.

The filmmakers have divided the film into three interlocking parts:  the first is a brilliantly staged war-is-hell recreation of the island battle; the second documents the bond tour; and the third involves present day interviews with the survivors reflecting back on their experiences.  Haggis and Broyles Jr. skillfully shift among the three time bands, helping us to sift out the truth from the messy mixture of fact and fiction that has always surrounded the event.  And even though the movie winds up eliciting tears from the audience in the end, it does so with a restraint and subtlety that keeps us from feeling manipulated and manhandled by the filmmakers - as we certainly did with ""Crash,"" when Haggis was serving as his own director.  He clearly does much better when he leaves that job to Mr. Eastwood.

The battle scenes, which combine amazing CGI effects with sepia-toned photography, have the same stunning force as those in ""Saving Private Ryan.""  No less impressive are the performances by a large and gifted cast, including Barry Pepper, Paul Walker and John Benjamin Hickey in relatively minor roles.  As the three young men who feel unworthy of the title ""hero,"" Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and especially Adam Beach, as a Native American affectionately referred to as ""Chief,"" turn in superlative work.

""Flags of Our Fathers"" is a moving, stirring and, above all, clear-eyed tribute to those who serve.",1163203200,,3887,4.934049079754601
2724325,5,B000M4RG4C,"Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers"" focuses on a pivotal event in World War II.  In February 1945, the Americans attacked the well-fortified island of Iwo Jima, which was populated by an army of well-prepared Japanese soldiers.  The Japanese had no intention of surrendering, since they considered Iwo Jima to be sacred Japanese soil.  On the fifth day of the bloody thirty-five day battle, American soldiers proudly raised the Stars and Stripes atop Mount Suribachi.  Soon thereafter, the first flag was lowered to be kept as a souvenir and a second flag raising was photographed by Joe Rosenthal.  Newspapers across the United States published this now famous image and it soon became an iconic symbol of valor.  Three of the six flag raisers died on Iwo Jima.  The remaining three were shipped back to America and ordered to tour the country and raise money for the war effort.

These three soldiers, Rene Gagnon, John ""Doc"" Bradley, and Ira Hayes, were not entirely comfortable being labeled ""heroes"". Their superiors cynically informed them that participating in the government's propaganda campaign was necessary in order to sell war bonds.  Therefore, Gagnon, Bradly, and Hayes had no choice but to go along in spite of their qualms.

""Flags of Our Fathers"" is an earnest and touching film about the mythology of war.  In order to maintain public support for their costly military endeavors, governments need to convince skeptical politicians and ordinary citizens that victory is within sight and that our men are not dying in vain.  America's military and political leaders used Gagnon, Bradly, and Hayes as pawns to shore up flagging morale and persuade citizens to sacrifice their sons and their hard-earned income to pay for the remainder of the war.  When the fighting ended and the soldiers had outlived their usefulness, they were abruptly cast aside and forgotten.

The battle scenes in ""Flags of Our Fathers"" are harrowing and graphic.  Eastwood shot some of the film in Iceland's forbidding landscape, and these stark black and white sequences show exhausted, grimy, and terrified young soldiers trying to survive from moment to moment as they watch their buddies being blown away all around them.  When a man is injured, bright red blood oozes from his gaping injuries.  The carnage is wrenching and heartbreaking.

The screenplay, by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis, is based on a book by James Bradley, Doc's son, and Ron Powers.  At times, the dialogue is difficult to follow, especially during the deafening and confusing battles, many of which are shown in flashback.  Eastwood explores a number of themes in ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" one of them being racism in the military.  Black soliders were segregated, and Ira Hayes, a Native American from Arizona, kept a frozen smile on his face when he was called ""chief"" and ""redskin.""  After Hayes returned to the states, he started to deteriorate emotionally and turned to alcohol to deaden his pain and guilt.  This man who stoically endured verbal abuse for years was disparaged for being a disgrace to his people and to the uniform.

Eastwood makes the point that asking our young men to leave their families and risk their lives to fight for their country may be a regrettable necessity, but it is nothing to celebrate.  A dead hero is still dead, leaving his grieving family to suffer forever after.  Medals are no substitute for husbands, fathers, and children.  The performances are all fine, but Adam Beach stands out as the disillusioned and tormented Ira Hayes.  The cast is basically an ensemble, with all of the actors contributing their part to the effort, much as their real life counterparts did back on that deadly, rocky island over sixty years ago.",1163116800,,3743,5.0129449838187705
2724326,4,B000M4RG4C,"The photograph of the raising of the American flag at Iwo Jima is one of the most famous pictures of World War II.  It was so moving that three of the surviving soldiers, John Bradley (Phillippe), Rene Gagno (Bradford), and Ira Hayes (Beach), were sent back to America to promote war bonds and raise the American flag at rallies.  Of course, they only raised the replacement flag, but that was kept from the public, lest it detract from what they were trying to accomplish.  ""Flags of Our Fathers"" jumps between these survivors making appearances to raise money, the war itself, and the interviewing of veterans by James Bradley in the present day.

""Flags"" is an interesting look at WWII and the heroes from that war.  It provides an interesting look at what exactly a hero is, and many will be surprised by the true story behind the actual flag raising.  Adam Beach is the standout amongst the cast as the Native American Ira Hayes.  He gives a performance that deserves to be recognized come Oscar time.  The rest of the cast is adequate, but not standout.  Eastwood's direction gets the job done, but I cannot help but think he is a little over his head with all the special effects used to create the battle scenes.  Eastwood is used to movies that are less ""big"", and it shows.  Overall, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is definitely worth seeing, and will provide a vision of the war that is not widely known by the American public.",1162771200,,1430,4.590551181102362
2724327,5,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags Of Our Fathers"" is brilliant! This is one of the year's best! It is an incredible tribute to the nature of heroism in America and to those men who commit these brave acts of heroism. Ryan Phillippe (as John ""Doc"" Bradley) and Adam Beach (as Ira Hayes) both give their best performances of their careers, Beach, especially worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Jesse Bradford (as Rene Gagnon) gives a great performance as well, but he doesn't equal Beach's and Phillippe's intensity in their performances. The directing by Clint Eastwood (who won the Oscar for his brilliant work on ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) is brilliant, again, and he deserves another Oscar nomination and possible win for one of the best films of his career. The screenplay by Paul Haggis (who recently won an Oscar for his work on ""Crash"" (2005) and was Oscar nominated for his work on Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"") & William Broyles Jr. (was Oscar nominated for his work on ""Apollo 13"" (1995), (which is based on the book by James Bradley, son of ""Doc"" Bradley, and Ron Powers) is brilliant, and deserves an Oscar nomination for their work on the screenplay. The music by Clint Eastwood (he also did the music to ""Million Dollar Baby"") is brilliant. The cinematography by Tom Stern (who recently did ""The Last Kiss"" (2006) & ""Million Dollar Baby"") is brilliant. The film editing by Joel Cox (who was nominated for an Oscar for his work on ""Million Dollar Baby"" & won the Oscar for his work on Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and has been working with Clint for 30 years) is brilliant. The casting by Phyllis Huffman (the movie was dedicated to her due to her untimely passing on March 2 and worked with Clint since ""Honkytonk Man"" (1982) is brilliant. The production design by Henry Bumstead (who worked with Clint since 1972 as art director and did the production design to Clint's films since ""Unforgiven"" and won Oscar for his work on ""The Sting"" (1973) & ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (1962), his last film that he designed will be Eastwood's ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" (2007), he, sadly, passed away, recently, on May 24) is brilliant. The art direction by Adrian Gorton (who also did the art direction to Clint's upcoming ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", and Clint's ""Mystic River"" (2003) & ""Blood Work"" (2002) & Jack G. Taylor Jr. (who also did the art direction to Clint's ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Mystic River"", ""Blood Work"", & ""Space Cowboys"" (2000) and also started working with Clint on ""A Perfect World"" (1993) is brilliant. The set decoration by Richard C. Goddard (who also did the set decoration to Clint's ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Mystic River"", ""Blood Work"", & ""Space Cowboys"" and also started working with Clint on ""Absolute Power"" (1997) is brilliant. The costume design by Deborah Hopper (who also did the costume design to Clint's ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Mystic River"", ""Blood Work"", & ""Space Cowboys"" and also started working with Clint as costume supervisor on ""Tightrope"" (1984) is brilliant. This is a powerful and heartfelt movie about the realities of war and heroism and how it makes heroes and certain people think and feel. This is one of Clint's best, up there with ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Mystic River"", & ""Unforgiven"". When Oscars roll around, Clint will be remember on that night. This is a little bit better and a little more emotional than ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), which was directed by Steven Spielberg, who also served as a producer on this film. This is one of the best war films in years.",1162598400,,3518,4.855241264559068

Some actors were in those previous movies too.  For interested parties that sat through the end credit, you would note that Steven Spielberg & Clint Eastwood are executive producers and thus, the resemblance.  Other than the ""look"", this movie is a far more complex movie tackling upon the public in search of pagan ""heroes"" to worship; racial discrimination (Adam Beach acted splendidly and to me anyway, the  the core emotional soul of this offering, & he was in John Woo's World War 2's Windbreakers); the war not being as clearcut as we imagine it to be, questioning if soldiers fight for their country, an idealogy, &/or for the buddies next to them; dissecting the ""(in)famous photo itself & shedding light to the hypocrisy & the conspiracy of the whole incident.  It's wise to sit through the end credits as there were more actual photos of Iwo Jima to browse through.  Clint Eastwood goes from strength to strength and his trademark seems to be getting the viewers to draw conclusion for themselves.  A movie that would linger on in your mind for a very long time.  Highly recommended.",1162598400,,1248,4.799065420560748
2724329,5,B000M4RG4C,"'I'll walk alone / because to tell you the truth I am lonely / I don't mind being lonely ..'

Those haunting lyrics, sung acapella over the opening credits by none other than Clint Eastwood himself, foreshadow the tragic fate of the three tortured souls at the heart of Flags of Our Fathers. This sad and moving elegy to the boys captured in Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph of the Iwo Jima flag-raising is one of the best films of the year. At 76 Clint Eastwood has developed the most extraordinary focus as a director and storyteller. Nothing distracts him. Even the jaw-dropping CG-enhanced battle scenes are used not to wow audiences vicariously but to underline why the three survivors are so haunted by their memories and why they will remain so for the rest of their lives.

The screenplay by Paul Haggis & William Broyles, Jnr. tracks three separate stories in three different time periods - the battle, the bond tour & a present day father/son bookend - then jumps back and forth between them in an unsettling manner that allows Eastwood and his superb editor Joel Cox to construct extraordinary juxtapositions between the horrors of the battlefield and the surreal acclaim experienced by the survivors on their bond tour. Some viewers have complained about this allegedly 'confusing' storytelling but in my humble opinion if you're paying attention and just go with the flow then the film is not hard to follow. You just need to be paying attention.

Flags covers a lot of ground yet despite a big cast & multiple themes it never loses its focus on Bradley and the other two flag-raisers. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. Of the principals Adam Beach has the showiest role as Ira Hayes, a tormented Indian inconsolable at the loss of his buddies, Ryan Phillippe is Navy corpsman John 'Doc' Bradley, who takes a stoic attitude to his experiences while Jesse Bradford turns in a sympathetic performance as the good looking Marine Rene Gagnon who hopes to capitalise on his new found fame.

Clint Eastwood deserves much credit here. Any other helmer could have easily gotten carried away with over-indulging the battle scenes, ramping up an emotional moment or drawing heavy-handed parallels with todays war (one shudders at the prospect of Oliver Stone having directed Flags), but Eastwood's uncanny knack for understatement allows him to navigate around  all these obstacles without ever seeming exploitative or heavy-handed. Indeed some of the most affecting moments in Flags - subdued Marines listening to music the night before battle, Ira walking down a winding country road after delivering a message to the father of a dead comrade, a joyous swim in the ocean - are some of the quietest.

Flags is also unlike other war movies in that it gives centre stage to the PR aspects of fighting a war. After all what happens on the home front can be just as important in winning as what happens on the battlefield. It's a sobering thought and the film plays fair by the Govt while dissecting the publics need for heroes and the enormous weight that need places on those lucky or unlucky enough to have to live up to the acclaim. The story underlines how the experience of combat can become a closed book even to family members. There is more thematic/narrative meat to chew on here than in a dozen Saving Private Ryan's and it qualifies as yet another major work (at the age of 76, amazing!) from America cinemas greatest living director.",1162512000,,3455,4.8474576271186445
2724330,4,B000M4RG4C,"MOVIE: Clint Eastwood has been on an extremely hot streak. He delivered a good film with Mystic River, a little overrated in my opinion, but still a strong and solid film. He then took the cake with Million Dollar Baby. Flags Of Our Fathers is a great story about courage and honor, but honestly so is every war story. The three central characters are Doc (Ryan Phillipe), Rene (Jesse Bradford), and Ira (Adam Beach). The film is told as a flashback through a series of interviews as we learn that the son of Doc is doing some research about his father. We jump back and forth to present day, back to the war, and to the characters after the war as they returned home as ""heroes"". William Broyles, Jr. and Paul Haggis wrote the screenplay and did a great job of structuring it. The characters start out together, they go on this journey together, but they soon start to separate. They are brought home because it is believed that they put up the flag at Iwo Jima, but in reality it was the second flag put up, the replacement flag. So, now they are brought home as heroes and we see how they are treated and used. One aspect of the film that made it unique was it's commentary on America's tolerance to Native Americans. Native Americans played a huge role in WWII, and even though our protagonists were heroes Ira was still treated like trash. He is constantly called ""chief"" or ""redskin"" and in one scene he is thrown out of a bar because they don't serve Indians. It's a sad sight to see how Americans treated the Native Americans who fought and died for freedom. Adam Beach gives a strong performance, it's a truly emotional film. The film is also visually striking.

  You can't help but wonder how the film would have looked without Steven Spielberg being the Executive Producer on the project. There are some striking similarities, visually speaking, to Saving Private Ryan. Eastwood also went with a very muted and gray tinted look. The film is almost black and white, and it does make it feel historical. Tom Stern's cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and is bound for an Oscar nomination. The way light is used in some scenes adds so much depth it's unbelievable and has to be seen. All the great stuff aside there is an aspect of the film that makes it less than spectacular. Clint Eastwood provides another simple score for the film, and while it works for some of his movies it usually doesn't. I was not fond of the score for Mystic River, but I loved Million Dollar Baby's score. This film needed a different sound, and Eastwood's simple keys on the piano only works well near the end of the film. While the action sequences have no music I do think that a more experienced composer could have done wonders for the film.

  The war genre has had so many entries over the history of film that I am starting to wonder is there anything left to explore? I mean, every aspect of war has been expressed through film and war movies now are starting to become repetitive. This film is about heroism and that the real heroes of Iwo Jima weren't the ones in the photograph but the ones who died out on that island. Yes, we've heard that before many times, but Eastwood gives us different perspectives on it. I guess it's hard to really analyze Flags Of Our Fathers since Letters From Iwo Jima has yet to come out. For those who did not know, Clint Eastwood made two films at once and Flags Of Our Fathers is the first of two companion pieces. Letters From Iwo Jima is the companion piece and is the same story of Iwo Jima told from the Japanese perspective, spoken in Japanese and all.

ACTING: There is no standout character here. This is another example of a great ensemble cast. The acting is great all around even though I question Eastwood's decision to put Paul Walker in this movie. All the actors give solid performances, but it's Adam Beach's performance as Ira Hayes that highlights the film. He is also the only character that makes the film something original.

BOTTOM LINE: Clint Eastwood gives an emotional look at the true definition of heroes during the war. The film is visually amazing and the acting is excellent, but the film overal feels like we've seen it before. Hopefully Letters From Iwo Jima will add more depth to this project.",1162425600,,4267,4.554106910039113
2724331,5,B000M4RG4C,"The story of the photograph of six soldiers raising the flag at Iwo Jima in 1945 is brought to the screen with the signatures of its producer, Steven Spielberg and Director, Clint Eastwood.  Based on the book by the son of one of the original flag raisers, the film not only depicts the full epic of war, but it also delves deeply into the bond drive that followed the publication of the photo, and the ambiguities as to which soldiers, exactly, were in the photograph.

The film is scrupulous in trying to tell the truth.  We meet the soldiers and get to know their horrific experience of the war.  And then we get to know the individuals who wound up in the public relations campaign across America.  And, briefly, we meet one of the men as an old man with flashbacks about it all.

Iwo Jima was one of the last strongholds of the Japanese.  In preparation of the invasion, the Americans bombed it for weeks until all vegetation was gone and the entire island was a scorched landscape with 20,000 Japanese troops dug in and willing to fight to the death. These battle scenes are shot in desaturated  shades of gray with occasional flashes of orange-yellow flames.  It's very effective, and very frightening, especially since by now we have become acquainted with some of the soldiers.  There's Doc, a medic, played by Ryan Phillipe.  There's Rene, played by Jessie Bradford.  And there's Ira Hayes, a Pima American Indian, played by Adam Beach.  We see fear, we see courage, and we see perseverance.

But the battle scenes are only part of the film as later, these three soldiers are wined and dined and trotted across America like pet monkeys.  Rene was offered business deals which he believed were really true.  Doc found himself in the position of lying to mothers about which soldiers were actually in the photograph.  And Ira became a raging alcoholic.

The story is complex and doesn't pull punches.  And even though I knew how it would all turn out, the acting and directing were so good that I was engaged throughout even though I didn't actually shed any tears.  But that was not what this film was about.  It was about setting the record straight on an historical event and the photo snapped by an Associated Press photographer that wasn't exactly a spontaneous act.  It's all very fascinating.

This is a fine film.  There's a lesson to learn.  And an historical record to set straight.  See it.",1162339200,,2409,4.66270783847981
2724332,5,B000M4RG4C,"One might find an irony in the fact that this wonderfully moving, sober, sad, stirring, mournful and yet, finally, uplifting film on the horror of war and the cynical, and yet necessary, propagandizing of heroism is directed by Clint Eastwood, whose own career has often been in the service of creating mythic heroes. But Clint's heroes always had a dark side, and now in the full flush of his maturity as a filmmaker, I can't think of anyone who could have handled this material better. This is a wise and knowing film, and the themes are dealt with an understated and deft touch that can only come from someone with a lifetime of experience and a sure hand on his art.  The film is artful and direct, paring away flash and filigree for surehanded simplicity.

First of all the production is glorious.  The recreation of that sulfurous, stinking rock that was Iwo Jima is faultless.  You need only look at the montage of authentic pictures accompanying the credits at the end to see how closely these craftsman have come to getting the look of the film exactly right. 1940's America is likewise expertly captured. The late Henry Bumstead was credited with production design, and it is a wonderful final tribute to his talent.

The performances are fine, with Ryan Phillipe as the stoic ""Doc"" Bradley, Adam Beach the troubled Ira Hayes, and Jesse Bradford the opportunistic Rene Gagnon.  These three survivors of the original six flag raisers carry their experiences on Iwo differently, and the toll taken on them is expressed in different ways. We are told enough of the their post-War lives to learn how different civilian life may play out for ""heroes"" when the bands stop playing, and the crowds stop cheering. Especially modest and reluctant men who have had the label ""hero"" thrust upon them.

The film is an elegiacal meditation on valor and heroism.  As it cuts back and forth from the 7th Bond Tour's pragmatic ""show-biz"" to the real and horrific savagery of the actual battle, it isn't so much finding villains to jeer at, but rather exploring the somber tragedy of the whole enterprise of war.  We learn the Bond Tour is necessary, because back-then the Goverment actually had to finance the war through public contributions, and they were running out of money.  The Flag Raising tour was wildly successful and probably helped to finish the war.  We see among the civilians those that didn't go to war but profited at home, but they are simply noted as a fact, incongruous and often awful, and terribly human.

The cutting back and forth from the battlefield to the tour also allows us to profoundly understand why these men were often so reluctant to talk about their experiences as we see first-hand how inexplicable that experience is to a civilian life light-years removed from anything remotely approximating its stark horror. The ghastly randomness of the violence that causes the loss of beloved friends is unflinchingly brought home.

Finally, the film is truly about heroism.  The simple valor of young men and their love and sacrifice for each other, if not for a greater cause.  This is a fine and wonderful film, full of quiet emotion and a tribute to the sacrifices many have made on our behalf.  It speaks volumes in few words.  Clint's ""Autumnal"" films have been a wonder.  I just hope he keeps finding materials worthy of the experience and depth he has to bring to them.  This is Master work here.",1162166400,,3425,4.79421768707483
2724333,5,B000M4RG4C,"I am the son of a veteran of Iwo Jima. Occasionally, my father would talk about his experiences there, but not with any detail.

Even though I, myself, am a veteran of the Vietnam era, I was not prepared for what I witnessed in this remarkable film. It is impossible to walk away from it and not understand that these Marines were very special people - people who did not understand how important they were to the war effort and the fight for freedom.

My father will never see this film or read the book because he has always refused to watch WWII movies or to read books on the subject. But as for me, after seeing that film, I sure do understand my father a lot better than I ever thought possible.

2724344,5,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags Of Our Fathers"" is a movie perfectly-suited for these times, examining the intersection of war, publicity, money and heroism.  With objective sobriety, director Clint Eastwood dissects how the U.S. government used the most famous photo of World War II - the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima - to drum up last-ditch support for war bonds.

The Greatest Generation? The power of this movie is how it reinforces that title by cutting it off right at the knees. The subtext and commentary is so significant that it forgives its imperfections of vaguely written characters and workmanlike performances. In fact, ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" almost depends on its blandness. Its aim is no less than busting the myth of American heroism.

It does so by retelling the story of that iconic shot revealing the cost of its existence through the men who starred on that war bond tour: medic Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), runner Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and front-line solider Ira Hayes (Adam Beach). They were in the photo almost by accident, raising the second flag that day on Mount Suribachi. But it was the second picture - not the first - that told the thousand-word story.

Bradley, Gagnon and Hayes - the only three in the picture who survived Iwo Jima - were whisked away from battle to meet President Truman and fumble their way through speeches. In one absurd moment, they scale a paper model of the mountain to plant Old Glory in front of 100,000 fans at Chicago's Solider Field. In another, they eat ice cream sundaes in the shape of the flag-planting.

The stoic, decent Bradley manages to keep his calm, but Hayes, a sensitive man whose Native American heritage is tossed back at him in offhand, racist jokes, gets into booze and fits of self-loathing, bawling in an embrace with a fallen comrade's mother. Gagnon soaks up the adoration, yet finds himself compromised and controlled. The celebrity - and the pressure to pander - is a significant burden. If you haven't erected a heroic complex, it's hard to be one.

The tour is intercut with The Battle For Iwo Jima. It was the kind of fight that put an exclamation point on the cruelty and illogic of World War II: More than 25,000 men died for a tiny Japanese island, whose use as a bomber airstrip was a happy accident discovered during the battle. After most of the men had died.

Eastwood captures the struggle with brutal elegance. Because Iwo Jima was a volcanic island, the sand was black sulfur, and the director desaturates the film stock to match it. The result is a moonscape of empty, stark wilderness, a tropical desert of flares and silent snipers. Distinctive and moody, existential dread oppresses the soldiers on that island, and cinematographer Tom Stern effectively uses shadows, especially in a scene where Doc discovers a friend in a sulfur cave, mutilated.

What a hellish, ugly, alien setting it is. As if to suggest its permanence, Eastwood casts this desaturated pall on the stateside tour scenes, too. In that crucial way, ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" draws out that emptiness to comment on the sheer suck of life that WWII was for this country.

We can see, quite well, that the war, along with the Holocaust, devastated the reckless, forward-leaning (and often fighting) spirit of Europe, castrated it, rendered it lifeless, without much hope, especially after half of it was consumed by new, equally Cold War.

But what did it do to America? Looking back on my primary education, I'd describe my impression as thus:

WWII catapulted the US to the top of the geopolitical polls, where it played a 40-year BCS Championship with the USSR Commicats, emerging, finally, with good quarterbacking from JFK and Reagan. It minted our military and moral superstardom, and created a story of elemental greatness needed to win that game of nukes and subs and spies - to sustain us in those hours when a balloon was shot down at the Berlin Wall, or Nadia Comaneci scored her perfect 10s.

In its final act, ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" hacks away at that aura. Wonderfully edited by Joel Cox, it follows the men's arcs after the tour and, through them, charts the numb, sick psyche of America underneath the hoopla of victory. We see divorce. Death. Distance. Loneliness. And beneath that is the insignificance imposed on the men by themselves and others, and the search to reverse it.

Thoreau's quote about the mass of men resonates here, with one twist: Gagnon, Bradley and Hayes were plucked from that mass to represent America, arisen. Their duty done, they are inserted back none the fuller or richer, more quiet and desperate.

It leads one to wonder: If not these lives rewarded, just which kind of life should one lead? Maybe desperation is the lot, in victory or defeat. Maybe it's the condition. For the stuff that really makes Ira and Doc heroes are the small duties they carry out in these final scenes and that they are of no great consolation or purpose is part of the tragedy.

What is righteous feels more like suffering. What is ""truth"" feels aberrant. America has backed itself into a corner of greatness, of pulling off one magnificent feat of strength after another, and ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" puts the image under the microscope to find a cacophony of citizens pleading ""not I.""

This portrait of America severely differs from that in ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and while those movies serve their place, thank Eastwood (and Steven Spielberg, who developed it) for this one. It is solemn, wise and more poignant than its initial diffidence would make it seem. It is one of the best movies of the year.",1161907200,,5599,4.8045738045738045
2724345,5,B000M4RG4C,"On February 23, 1945, not long before World War II came to an end, a photograph was taken in the midst of a battle, one that captured five United States Marines and one U.S. Navy corpsman raising the American flag atop Mount Suribachi on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. It became one of the most famous photographs in American history, and for that mid-twentieth century generation, it instilled hope and pride. This photograph is the center of Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" a truly remarkable film that addresses heroism, celebrity, and the inhumanity of war. It also addresses the public's misconceptions about the famous photo; it captured a second flag raising ceremony, one that was held in order to prevent Secretary of the Navy, James Forrestal, from keeping the first flag as a souvenir.

I honestly can't say whether or not this film makes a political statement. On the one hand, it asks us to be respectful to those who fought for their country. That's certainly fair. But on the other hand, it portrays the war realistically, mixing horrific images and raw emotions into something that doesn't allow for swellings of pride. This was a wise move on Eastwood's part, considering many of the soldiers who had minimal roles in the war were permanently labeled as heroes. This is exactly what happened to John ""Doc"" Bradley, Ira Hayes, and Rene Gagnon (portrayed in the film by Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach, and Jesse Bradford) three of the six soldiers who took part in the flag raising ceremony. After the Battle of Iwo Jima, the three men returned to America amidst national praise, which very quickly led to a turbulent ride on a political and economic roller coaster.

Being thrust into the spotlight couldn't have been fun, and understandably, the men go through a gamut of emotions. Phillippe, Beach, and Bradford put everything they had into their characters, each with a depth and complexity that's rarely seen in movies anymore. This is important for the audience's sake; keep in mind that the soldiers experienced terrible things, things that no one should ever have to experience. We're made very aware of this during some intense battle scenes, none of which portray war gloriously. Even when Japanese soldiers are shot dead, victory is not felt; there's genuine humanity coursing through the film's veins, and that made watching these scenes effectively uncomfortable. When surrounded by bullets, fire, and shrapnel, one can't get a sense of Hero vs. Enemy, especially when graphic shots of detached limbs, gaping wounds, and bloody corpses are factored in (even a severed head finds its way into the film).

Eastwood clearly knew what he was doing here; by showing the reality of war, respect can be strengthened. However, it can also be destroyed, especially if the true level of brutality were brought to light. Bradley, Hayes, and Gagnon understand that the American public is shielded from this sense of reality; they see the three soldiers as nothing but fearless, flawless, all-American heroes. They're quickly branded as the Heroes of Iwo Jima, after which they're forced to participate in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Seventh War Bond Drive. They tour the country promoting the benefits of buying war bonds, doing their part by making speeches and performing in unnecessary reenactments (one of which was during a football game). ""The real heroes,"" Gagnon tries to emphasize during one such promotion, ""are dead on that island."" It falls on deaf ears; their victory has sparked an unprecedented commercial frenzy, with the famous photograph being used for posters, stamps, and flyers.

But the truth is less commercially acceptable; the soldiers were just as much in the heat of battle as the Japanese were, meaning they did some things that no respectable soldier should ever do. ""I can't take being called a hero,"" sobs Hayes, remembering that many of the men he admired didn't make it home (some of which appeared in the second photograph). Hayes has an incredibly difficult time adjusting to his fame, and he frequently drowns his sorrows in alcohol. He usually appeared at public events in a drunken stupor, just barely able to manage a facade of sobriety. What's worse is that he's a full-blooded Native American, meaning he was often subject to demeaning remarks, from both his peers and his government. It was both enlightening and depressing to watch this character, especially with such heavy emotional baggage. Consider the moment when he meets the mother of one of the dead soldiers; the two introduce themselves by latching onto each other and crying uncontrollably.

Interwoven throughout the film are present day sequences, in which Bradley's son, James (Tom McCarthy), interviews some of the surviving veterans in order to write a book. I wasn't too sure about this at first; I was initially led to believe that their inclusion was only an excuse to include the musings of flat, uninspired Wise Old Men caricatures. But the more they spoke, the more I came to realize that they were incredibly significant; their personal experiences enabled them to convey the complexities of war perfectly. By the end of ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" it becomes clear that there's no dying in a blaze of glory when it comes to war. It also becomes clear that a picture--specifically ""Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima""--isn't necessarily worth a thousand words.",1161820800,,5385,5.0325112107623315
2724346,4,B000M4RG4C,"John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira ""Chief"" Hayes (Adam Beach) are three of the many Marines involved with the World War II battle for the Japanese stronghold, Iwo Jima. Initially, they arrive on the island and meet little resistance, and then the Japanese open their bunkers and start firing on the unsuspecting U.S. Marines. The targets are the big guns the Japanese have built into the rock of the island, protecting the path to Japan. The battle is hard, and they witness many bad things, but the Marines eventually win the battle. Early in the battle, Doc, Chief and Gagnon are among the soldiers who raise the flag on the island, providing the iconic image of the battle and the war. A photographer snaps their picture and the image appears in newspapers and magazines across the country, giving the public hope. The government, in a financial crisis, realizes this photo could help sell war bonds, save the government from bankruptcy and help win the war. They decide to bring the surviving soldiers back to America, to speak and make public appearances. Gagnon is only too happy to oblige, and get out of the line of fire. He provides the names of Doc and Chief and the three begin a cross country tour. Along the way, Chief turns to drink to help drown the memories of his fallen comrades.

Directed by Clint Eastwood and written by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis (""Crash"", ""Million Dollar Baby""), ""Flags of our Fathers"" is the first of two films depicting the same event from different viewpoints. Next year, we will see a film telling the Japanese viewpoint of this same battle hits the multiplexes. This is an interesting idea. But it doesn't help make ""Flags of our Fathers"" better than it is. ""Flags"" is an okay film, a competent film, but not a great film.

I have mentioned it before, but when a filmmaker makes a series of great or outstanding films, they raise the bar for themselves along with everyone else. After ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Mystic River "" from director Clint Eastwood and ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Crash"" from screenwriter Haggis, you would expect ""Flags"" to be a great film. Because it isn't, it seems like even more of a let down.

There are two key problems with the film. The first is the method of telling the story.

The film begins in the present, with the elderly Doc, who now owns a funeral home. He wakes up at night, next to his wife, frightened by nightmares of Iwo Jima. Then, as the film progresses, we go back to just before the Marines leave for the battle and meet the three men and some of their buddies. Then, we flash forward a couple of months to the three men on tour promoting war bonds, dealing with the memories of the people left behind. These memories cause a flash back to another key moment in the battle. Flash forward to present day and Doc's son talking to various survivors of Iwo Jima about the event, which leads to more flash backs. I don't mind a story that jumps around a bit; in fact I prefer it, because it makes us an active participant in the story, allowing us to figure things out. But to make this a success, the characters have to be fleshed out and memorable. That isn't the case in ""Flags"". During the present day scenes, we never get a sense of who Doc's son is. He meets with various survivors, interviewing them, and we also see him writing a book about his father's experiences. Who is this guy? Is he a writer? Why is he just now writing this book? At one point, Doc tells his son ""I wish I had been a better father."" Huh? This is the first moment we have ever seen of discord in their relationship. In fact, it is one of the few moments we have even seen them together.

Eastwood used a similar technique in ""The Bridges of Madison County"". Two adult siblings learn about an affair their mother had in the 60s with a National Geographic photographer, after she dies. They read a letter from her, talking about the affair and what it meant to her, prompting a flash back and the main story. But in ""Bridges"" we actually learn about these characters.

In ""Flags"", this character is largely unknown to us, giving us no involvement in his story or his life.

A couple of the people the son interviews are unknown until we realize, through the flash back, who they are. I was unable to place one of the subjects, even while watching the flashbacks. How does this help us become emotionally invested in the story? It doesn't. We have to know who the characters are, to become interested in them, to become invested in their actions, the horrors they witness and their lives.

All of this would be forgiven if the three main characters, or their colleagues, had a discernible character during their appearances. Ryan Phillippe plays Doc, a Navy Corpsman who accompanies the Marines, providing medical assistance as they are wounded. Despite one scene in which he searches for a lost patient, he merely stands around as an observer, helping people, but he seems little affected by the events during the war. During their tour of the States, his sole purpose seems to be to provide a shoulder for ""Chief"" to lean against when he is drunk.

Jesse Bradford's Rene Gagnon comes into his own when he arranges for certain people to return to the States, to escape the horrors of war. He reveals his personality, trying to work the angles to get a couple of his friends a ticket back home. As they tour, he meets with various businessmen who offer him a job when the war is over. In other words, Gagnon is looking out for himself. During the tour, he relishes the spotlight and the attention.

The real emotional center of the film is Adam Beach's Ira Hayes. During the battle, he is most affected by the horrors of the war and when he returns home, he is plagued by nightmares. He turns to drink and becomes a sloppy drunk, not exactly what the government was hoping for, and to help promote the war bonds it so desperately needs to sell.

In almost every scene, Hayes is fighting with someone, trying to maintain the integrity of the battle they fought for Iwo Jima, or drowning himself in drink, because of all of the friends he lost. At one point, when the three are first staring the tour, the Treasury official who has arranged the tour, invites the mothers of the less fortunate Marines at Iwo Jima to attend a party. When Hayes meets the mother of his close friend, he breaks down and sobs onto her shoulder, holding onto her.

Paul Walker, Robert Patrick, Barry Pepper, Jamie Bell and others pop up as other members of the Marine Corps, serving with the three survivors. Unfortunately, they make little impact and as the other three men mourn their lost comrades and I fought hard to remember their names every time Phillippe, Bradford or Beach mentioned them.

Perhaps the best part of the film is the depiction of the story behind the image. As the film progresses and we work our way through the various elements, we learn more and more about the iconic image. For instance, the flag was originally raised by another group of Marines. A photographer takes a picture of that as well, but the film is ruined. Then, because of other factors, the flag is raised again by Doc, Ira and Rene, among others. This photo survives. In the States, they tell the Treasury official of the first flag, who responds ""Is anyone else getting a headache?"" He wants to avoid this public relations nightmare.

And this photo strikes a chord with the public, giving them hope during an increasingly difficult war. Naturally, the government seeks to capitalize on this, immortalizing the moment in a dramatic painting, ice cream sculptures and reenactments. This powerful act, this image, became a public relations tool, an icon to get the message across. The government began to sell an image of this war the three men know isn't true, but they go along with it, to help the war effort.

Technically, ""Flags"" is a well-done film. You would expect nothing less from Clint Eastwood and producer Steven Spielberg. They bring an eye to detail for every scene, recreating the States during the mid 40s, recreating the battle, searing these images into our brains. But they seem to have spent most of their effort on this, forsaking some of the character development. All the set dressing in the world can't help make Doc or Gagnon into three dimensional characters. Then, when the story starts to visit these people in the present, we lose any emotional connection to them.

Why is Doc's son writing the book? Why is Doc apologizing for how he raised his son? Because these questions are never answered, they will be the images and ideas from ""Flags of our Fathers"" that will live with me.

2724347,5,B000M4RG4C,"I read the book and found it incredibly compelling and one of the best WWII books I have ever read.  The book presented things in a sequential manner but the movie bounced back and forth between the battle, the bond tour and as elderly gentlemen.

Well I don't have to tell you that this it not Saving Private Ryan.  Is it real life.  It is very sad and disturbing but it is what it is.  It was war.  It was about a horribly bloody battle that many brave young men gruesomly died in.  It is about how 3 surviving guys that just happened to be there to help stand up the second flagpole on Surabaci and their picture made it safely to Guam to be developed and was safely ""electronically"" transmitted to NY and put on the front of the NYTimes.  It is about how they were used to raise money for the war effort.  I guess it is something we can't fathom today but America was broke and they really needed $14B.  These 3 guys helped raise that money.  One loved it, one hated it and one just did it.

The scenes on Iwo Jima were an off color kind of black and white (except for the US flag).  Very powerful.

I would highly recommend seeing this film.  It is sad but it is reality.  No sugar coating.  I truly enjoyed it.  But I must say when Mike Strank died I cried just like when I read the book.",1161734400,,1294,4.108
2724348,4,B000M4RG4C,"Since Mystic River (2003) and following four decades in the film industry, the 70-something veteran director-actor Eastwood delivered reflective films that explored and debunked particular iconic myths (some of them created by Eastwood himself during his prolific career in the 60s and 70s). In a sense, Eastwood resumed an earlier phase in career with films such as Unforgiven (1992) and In the Line of Fire (1993).

Eastwood's antiheroes were designed to counteract the simplistic heroes of John Wayne (see my review of Wayne's last western, The Shootist, 1976). Eastwood's retired gunslinger in Unforgiven (exploring the myth of Eastwood's Man With No Name persona in the 1960s spaghetti westerns) is not as gallant as Wayne's dying Shootist.

Sean Penn's mournful, vigilante character is more complex and totally unheroic, compared to Eastwood's 1970s & 1980s antihero cop Dirty Harry. Eastwood's ageing trainer in Million Dollar Baby (2004)is on the verge of moving away from the regret and rejection of the past as he coaches an emerging champion coming from nowhere - but, unlike Mickey in Rocky I-III and Rocky himself in Rocky V, a tragic accident robs him of his chance to compensate for past failures as boxing coach and parent.

And now, Eastwood's Flags of our Fathers (2006) is in complete contrast to the jingoism and propagandism of Wayne's Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), about the same episode of the WWII Pacific island campaign, or The Green Berets (1968), and more similar to WWII veteran John Ford's film about the Pacific campaigns of WWII, They Were Expendable (1945). Another attempt of Eastwood to debunk the myth of the Wayne persona, in this case the war hero.",1161734400,,1682,5.109090909090909
2724349,3,B000M4RG4C,"I love Clint Eastwood and his movies, but this one missed the mark for me. There were some nice moments scattered throughout, but the acting, and the way they edited the back and forth storyline just weren't as strong as I would have liked. The battle scenes were pretty good (though not even close to Saving Private Ryan) as was the directing. For a short war film at around two hours, it felt longer than Saving Private Ryan. This is not even close to being a bad film, but it is one that I should have waited for on DVD.",1161648000,,523,4.24
2724350,4,B000M4RG4C,"FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS opens with a haunting accapella version of the Sammy Kahn/Jule Styne song, ""I'll Walk Alone.""  Indeed, the dark imagery resonates within the entire theme of the film, which invokes how the ""good war"" was rather surreal and dark rather than the nostalgic and flag-waving patriotic photographs that have been portrayed in numerous World War II news reels and pictures.  Clint Eastwood provides the revised version to history with much graphic detail, which is characterized in the words and perceptions that are conveyed by the voices of the past.

FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a film about the three surviving flag raisers, Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon, and John Bradley.  Director Clint Eastwood concentrates on the Bond Tour in which these three veterans had to undertake in order to raise funds to supply more weaponary for the US military to end World War II.  Eastwood stays true to the book by James Bradley, but also offers a complex structure to the film, which makes the viewer think.  For example, the introduction of each of the key individuals who helped raise the flag on Iwo Jima are clearly presented in the book, but in the film, they are fragmented memories and flashbacks by the remaining survivors; it is an intense recreation of loss, reconnection, and understanding to those who lost their lives.  Ira Hayes's story was one of the most heartbreaking and unfortunate circumstance to the war, and adds another commentary to the understanding of American history in terms of the sum and all its parts.

The cinemtography and the special effects in the film attempt to authenticate the look of the era.  From the beach battle scenes that overlook Mount Suribachi to the initial fighting on Iwo Jima, Eastwood utilizes the same technique that Steven Speilberg used for ""Saving Private Ryan"" when depicting the ravages of war.  The overall ""washed over"" color of the film provides an emphasis to the past.  However, the digitalized images of the navy fleets in the ocean appear excessive as compared to the real images that are depicted in archival photos that are presented at the end of the film.

Overall, FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a film worth watching.  It provides yet another perspective to World War II, and especially the War in the Pacific, which usually is overlooked.",1161648000,,2301,4.9147286821705425
2724351,5,B000M4RG4C,"The Premise:

Flags of our Fathers is being advertised as a WWII film. That's not entirely accurate. While a great deal of the film does take place during the assault on Iwo Jima, this film is really less about the war and more about raising of the flags on Mt. Suribachi (in case you didn't know by now, there were two flags raised) and the men participated, or didn't participate, in the raising of the second flag.

Flags of our Fathers doesn't have much in the way of a plot so it's difficult to describe what this film is about without talking about it's message, and that's the film's job not mine. Suffice it to say, a second flag is raised (for reasons best left to the film to describe) and the press corps uses it as a photo opportunity. Stateside this now legendary photo becomes iconic of the war. The U.S. Government is understandably near bankruptcy from the war in the pacific and having just fought a war in Europe. Civillian moral is low, and it's decided that the government will play on the popularity of this picture by touring the remaining living soldiers who were in the picture around the country as a huge publicity stunt to sell much needed war bonds.

John Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) play the three surviving soldiers in the picture. They don't consider themselves heroes and they are at odds with being treated as such especially since they didn't raise the real flag.

Thoughts:

Flags of our Fathers is an ugly film. Eastwood has successfully taken one of America's most prideful and storied moments (WWII) and turned it on it's head by showing us the truths we don't want to see. We honor these soldiers now because we failed to do so before. Time and time again, the three ""heroes of Iwo Jima"" state to the crowds they are presented before that the real heroes are the ones that died on that island, but no one really listens. No one really cares. The picture of them planting that flag is their connection; their way of feeling a part of the winning team much like how a sports fanatic doesn't care about the real person as much as the fact they wear the same colors.

I have a feeling Flags of our Fathers isn't going to appeal to a lot of people because it's an uncompromising look at who we are as a society in the same way a mirror is to a fat person. No matter what make-up or fancy clothes they put on, the mirror still reveals the truth of the problem. Like I said, this is a very ugly film, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a bad film.

I went in to this film expecting it to be below par for a Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby) film due to the reviews I've read. I went in with a critic's mind waiting for all these supposed failures of the film so that I could accurately relay them in my own critique, but they aren't there. Certainly, as I've mentioned, there are reasons to find this film distasteful and not enjoyable to watch. Eastwood certainly isn't attempting to simply entertain you here, and many aren't going to be entertained. However, subjective reactions don't mean a film is bad.

Flags of our Fathers, like Eastwood's most recent films, has something to say. Like Mystic River, it seems facinated with the concept of what we perceive to be the truth, what we want to be the truth, and what the truth really is and how they're almost never the same thing. This film elicits a strong reaction from the viewer. Whether you like it or hate it, agree with it or disagree with it, you will have feelings about this film and it will stick with you.

This film will certainly draw comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, but it's not entirely fair to do so. Saving Private Ryan's purpose was paint these soldiers as heroes (and rightfully so), and while Flags of our Fathers definately shows these soldiers as hereos (even the three who don't consider themselves to be so) it's real purpose is to show that the only heroes we see are those that are in our imaginations. The real heroes die unknown and forgotten.

The only faults to this film seem trivial to the overall picture. It does seem to run a little long, and the narrative seems disjointed at times. The acting performances are all good (even Paul Walker) but fall short of greatness. Others will claim that this film serves as an allegory to today's political environment, but Eastwood is simply showing us that as much as things are different they are the same. And he should know; he was there.

The Verdict:

Clint Eastwood shows again why he's one of the greatest filmmakers in cinema. Flags of our Fathers' less obvious themes are very similar his past work while the film itself is completely different. The lack of a plot driven story and it's unflinching look the ugly side of America should make you consider before seeing this film. Beyond the subjective entertainment level this film will bring to various people, Flags of our Fathers stands as a great American film that deserves to be applauded. Bravo, Clint! Bravo.

Extras:

Clint Eastwood actually shot two films when he made Flags of our Fathers. The second film acts as a companion piece that serves to tell about the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective. It's based on a book called ""Red Sun, Black Sand"" but the name for the film has been changed to ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" It stars Ken Watanabe (Last Samurai, Batman Begins). Look for it around January or February.",1161648000,,5456,4.5540816326530615
2724352,5,B000M4RG4C,"This is a story of conflicts. It does not disappoint; neither does it entertain. It is a must-see; it is not enjoyable.  It raises more questions than it answers.

Like most Boomers I was raised to revere the flag-raising on Mount Surabachi. Finding out the truth behind it was a punch in the stomach, and yet that truth did not diminish the sacrifice of the brave men who made that flag-raising possible. I believe the combat flashbacks were entirely realistic, though never having been in combat, I am only qualified as an intellectual, not experiential judge. The combat scenes had the effect of satisfying the quest for glory that lies buried beneath the surface of most American males. At that same time they aroused great feelings of disgust. When the one man was blown to bits from an artillery round and his helment landed on his buddy with the severed head inside, I was disgusted by the senseless gore but even more disgusted by my delight in that gore.

Learning that the government manufactured the three heroes for the sake of a war bond drive was another punch in the stomach, a worse one. The government bureaucrat argued quite well that previous bond drives had failed to reach goal and that the war effort was in jeopardy as a result. If the three were not true heroes, they had an obligation to act the part, of only for the money. With its lofty ideals of freedom and democracy, why must the nation always be fooled into doing the right thing? But learning the ignominious fates of the three was the worst punch of all. What a manic-depressive lot we are to place such men on the loftiest of pedestals only to forget them when the parades are over and piles of ticker tape lie in the street.

In summary, there is disappointment to be found in this movie, but not in the film itself as some of the other reviewers have complained. The disappointment lies in ourselves.

An aside: US forces suffered 26,000 casualties with nearly 7,000 dead in taking Iwo Jima. A point made in the movie was that Iwo was a vital emergency landing sight for the many B-29 crews returning from Japan, underscored by the landing of the B-29 'Dinah Mite' while the island was still unsecured. Further research shows that for the remainder of the war 2,251 'genuine' emergency landings were made on Iwo. Assuming the average emergency landing saved the lives of a full B-29 crew of 13 members (this was later in the war), that's over 29,000 men saved not to mention the 2,251 aircraft. It's anybody's guess as to whether all of those emergencies would have suffered complete loss of crew out over the Pacific, but it appears that the operation showed a net profit. War is, after all, a business albeit a grim one.

2724353,4,B000M4RG4C,"This film takes on a formidable challenge: try to provide viewers with a dramatic discussion of the Battle of Iwo Jima that's faithful to what scattered knowledge still remains. Our knowledge of massive historical events is generally pasted together from numerous fragmentary accounts collected from a bewildering variety of isolated viewpoints, making the assembly of a coherent narrative nearly impossible. For this reason, most cinematic recreations must resort to extensive embellishment and simplification to plug the gaps and keep events clear and dramatic, alterations that usually result in angry accusations of ""Hollywood-ism"".

To confront this seemingly intractable problem, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" chooses a truly innovative storytelling structure, a structure that is so astonishingly different that it has clearly confused its audience and reviewers. Essentially, this is a chronological retelling of three veterans going on a WAR BOND tour, but the narrative not only flashes back to the war, but also flashes FORWARD to present day discussions with survivors. It is very unusual for a film to show us the sources of its information, but by doing so the film wants to make us aware of its own gaps and conjecture so that we can decide for ourselves what may or may not be true. We can understand, for instance, why Doc Bradley's character seems so bland when we realize that his son is trying to tell a story about a man who avoided talking about the war, thus putting limits on what he knows and will respectfully reveal about his father.

This focus on the war bond tour also means that, despite grand special effects and kinetic advertising, this film is not about battlefield action scenes, but rather about how three tortured veterans get dragged across the nation's hotel rooms as they respond to relentless publicity and romantic misconceptions.  Nevertheless, there is enough combat in the film to make direct comparison to ""Saving Private Ryan"" unavoidable, but Eastwood, whether because of his age or his background, does not edit his action with same type of frantic desperation that Spielberg specializes in. Instead, Eastwood's strength lies in his mastery of reflection, and this is a film that indeed gives us much to reflect on.",1161475200,,2258,5.197802197802198
2724354,4,B000M4RG4C,"This is a movie of ups and downs, good and not so good, heroics and abject failures. This is not to be construed as a film about Iwo Jima, but rather is somewhat of a documentary of the three surviving members of the six men in the famous flag raising picture of Iwo Jima. On February 23, 1945, American forces reached the top of Mt. Suribachi and five Marines and one Navy Corpsman were photographed raising an American flag. FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a loose adaptation of that event and its impact on the war.

In actuality, the famous photo was not the original flag raising on Mt. Suribachi. The original flag was coveted by a Washington politician. The movie depicts this person as a cabinet member. Something deep in my memory banks tells me this person was actually a Congressman, but I could be mistaken. At any rate, a Marine Officer at the scene wasn't about to let the flag fall into the politicians hands, so he ordered the original flag replaced and it was this replacement flag that was actually raised by the six men and depicted in the famous picture. Three of the six men were later killed on Iwo Jima and the three surviving members, two marines and the corpsman, were recruited into a public relations campaign to sell war bonds.

The film, in Hollywood fashion, takes a rather cynical look at heroism. It should be noted that none of the three survivors considered themselves heroes, and granted, the act of raising a flag in and of itself, is not a particularly heroic act, but nonetheless, the photograph elevated the men to hero status, which the movie deconstructs piece meal.

The acting and casting are both very good, and the battle scenes are extraordinarily realistic and graphic. I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough of the event to dispute some of what I saw, but I see some discrepancies of what I believe to have been true. For instance, and perhaps I have inadvertently credited an old Johnny Cash ballad as fact when that may not have been the case, but I believed Ira Hayes drowned when he passed out drunk in an irrigation ditch. This is not how his death is portrayed in the film.

As war movies go, the action and filming of the battle scenes was extraordinary, but for me, the film overall was a little too cynical and almost seemed to have a bit of anti-American slant to it. If you're looking for good war action footage, you'll like the movie. If you're looking for a riveting storyline, you'll likely be disappointed.",1161475200,,2468,4.6022727272727275
2724355,4,B000M4RG4C,"James Bradley's novel ""Flags of our Fathers"" was one of the greatest historical books ever written. By taking a human look at the battle of Iwo Jima and the lives of the men in Rosenthal's famous photograph, we got a very emotional look at ordinary men in one of the bloodiest battles of American history.
As I went in to the theater to see Clint Eastwood's film adaptation of Bradley's book, I was very optimistic. I felt that this could be the definitive World War II film set in the Pacific Theater. Sadly, I found the film to be a bit of a disappointment. It was a good film, but not the defining film it should have been.
Acting wise, the actors give fine performances. While Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Barry Pepper, Paul Walker and Neil McDonough all do a great job, the standout performance is by Adam Beach as Ira Hayes, the most tortured of the flagraisers. After seeing him in the underrated ""Windtalkers,"" I thought it would be hard to see him as anyone but Ben Yazee. But Beach's performance blew me away. He definitely penetrates the heart of the character, showing how tormented he truly was. Beach should finally get some long-overdue recognition as an actor.
The battle sequences are outstanding. The scenes definitely put you in the middle of the battle of Iwo Jima. And the scene of the flag-raising is truly memorable, as it shows what really happened with great reverence.
Where the film fails, however, is in the storytelling and editing. The movie jumps between the battle of Iwo Jima, and the story of the three flaig-raisers who survived, only to take part in the 7th War Bond's Tour as manufactured heroes. But the film jumps back and forth too much, and this becomes a distraction after a while. Also, two of the flag-raisers, Harlon Block and Frank Sousley, are hardly even dealt with in the film. To me, these characters deserved more than they got. Their deaths are also dealt with too quickly; after one dies, it's on to the next one to die, without any time to actually ""feel"" for these men. This is where the movie had its weak points.
Despite the flaws, it is a good tribute to the men who fought and died on Iwo Jima, and how one photograph made unwilling heroes out of six men who were just doing their job. If you're a fan of World War II films, or of Clint Eastwood's work, then you should find ""Flags of our Fathers"" to be a solid work.

2724356,4,B000M4RG4C,"""Flags of Our Fathers,"" above all else, is the story behind what author James Bradley calls ""The Photograph.""  Six Marines are forever immortalized when they're caught on film raising the American flag to mark the capture of Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi, the island's strategic high ground.

Recognizing the iconic appeal of this incredibly heroic image, at a time when financial support for the war effort is failing, the U.S. Government decides to ride this picture for all it's worth, dispatching the three surviving flag raisers on a grueling nationwide tour to promote war bonds.  The problem is that reality cannot possibly live up to this icon of heroism, a truth the movie gradually reveals by flashing backward and forward between footage of the Iwo Jima battle, the bond tour, and the research into these events conducted years later by the son of one of the three soldiers, medic John (Doc) Bradley (played with perfect understatement by Ryan Phillipe).

As is turns out, the flag captured in the picture is not the first flag raised, but rather a substituted decoy that allows the Marines to ensure that an opportunistic politician doesn't get his hands on the original.  There also are conflicting accounts as to the identity of the dead soldiers in the picture, creating unbearable angst among the surviving family members.  And what's worse, from the perspective of the three surviving soldiers, is the powerful sense that they are unworthy of the hero labels attached to them, knowing in their hearts that the real heroes of Iwo Jima are their thousands of fallen comrades.

Each of the three bears his shame differently.  Doc Bradley carries on in quiet, stoic pain, the essence of the Eastwood hero, unwilling to talk about what happened even with his own family.  Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) turns to excessive drink, threatening to become an embarrassment to the Government's well-orchestrated bond campaign.  And Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), the extroverted face man, becomes utterly consumed by the publicity, leaving an empty shell of a man who's quickly discarded once his time in the sun has passed.

While the film accomplishes what it sets out to do, analyzing this powerful icon and what it reveals about heroism, I wouldn't call it Eastwood's best work.  It felt rushed to me in places, as the rapid flitting between different time periods made it hard to flesh out the characters or achieve a distinct point of view.  In that sense it's almost the antithesis of the linear, focused plotting in my favorite Eastwood movie, ""Unforgiven."" Yet this film, with its brutally-realistic battle scenes and historically-authentic feel, is sure to take its place alongside ""Saving Private Ryan"" as one of the most powerful and moving films commemorating the Second World War.

2724357,4,B000M4RG4C,"Majestic and gripping, the key battle scenes of Iwo Jima bring it all back home the horrors of heroism.  Unsanitized, we get the true grit of unselfish men like Hank Hansen (Paul Walker), Mike Strank (Barry Pepper), and Ralph ""Iggy"" Igorski (Jamie Bell). 'Flags of Our Fathers' does a great job of showing the sweep and precariousnous of American forces capturing the famous desolate island in the Pacific.  Interspersed are scenes glorifying the men who were in the famous picture, capturing the turning moment when the American flag was unfurled on the top of Iwo Jima.

Ira Hayes (Beach), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), and John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) stand in front of multitudes and smile, giving words of encouragement for people to buy war bonds to help win the war.  They reluctantly take credit for the brave flag raising because it is expediant, they are  ordered to, and they are in the famous second flag raising that became the center of the historic picture.  Their dilemma is understandable.  Everyone feels uncomfortable at a cocktail party when one receives a compliment in front of others that one feels one doesn't deserve.  Multiplied by exponents, you understand their disposition.  Gagnon steps up to the plate and means it when he tells the multitudes that the dead men they left behind are the real heroes.  Everyone takes this as modest words, and their military promoter, who needs them to fit the bill, won't have it any other way.  We see that other men who showed more military guts went up to plant the flag, and many of them were killed.  Hayes, Bradley, and Gagnon replaced the flag when a politician demanded to get the first raised flag as a symbolic prize.  Near the end of the movie, one of the elder ""Doc"" states that heroes are created because we need them.  While many of the men like Sgt. Strank laid down their lives for others, everyone contributed to the impossible.  The featured three men were casualties of their reputations and the shadow of the contributions others made, especially the Native American, Ira, who went back to the war front.  All three men had a different fate, but the hurt of the secrets remained.

'Flags of Our Fathers' is a magnificent film, but it spends too long trying to define heroes and dwelling on the dilemma of heroes who lived sincerely to promote a good cause:  Fighting to defeat tyranny at war with allegedly smaller contributions and with fundraisers at home.  It is good to hear and see the true story in all its ramifications, but after all is said in done, they are all heroes for heeding their nation's call when freedom itself was in danger of extinction.  The first actual flag raising electrified the troops and brought their morale up to a real victory.  The photograph changed the morale of the nation and still retained the truth it was meant to elicit.  It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if it was shaky on the details.  Great performances are given all around, and the dynamic duo, Clint Eastwood and Paul Haggis ('Million Dollar Baby,' director and writer, respectively) deliver another hallmark movie.",1161302400,,3111,4.8283018867924525
2724358,4,B000M4RG4C,"I decided to check out ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" today because it seemed interesting to me. (I love movies with violence). It's a movie going back to when America was involved in the World War II back in 1944. The main part of the movie is based on a story telling of events that the characters were going through while fighting the Japaneese Army, and also it is sort of around an Iwo Jima controversy of who was apart of planting that flag and how the characters end becomming ""heros"" to the public. There are a lot of war scenes in this movie that shows alot of blood, head and limbs being blown off. So parents, if you are highly offended by violence towards you and your kids, I recommend that you don't come within 10 feet of this movie.

As for anything bad. The only part that got annoying was the consistant flashback into the war scenes throughout the movie, so at some points it was a little hard for me to keep up with whats going on. Other than that, this is an enojoyable movie. It was based off the origonal book ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" (I'm not fully sure if it is based on a true story). I believed that Clint Eastwood and Stephen Spilberg did a very good job with this movie. If you like war movies with a lot of action, I highly recommend this movie to you.

2724359,1,B000M4RG4C,"I had been looking forward to FLAGS OF OUR FATHTERS with great anticipation after reading the fantastic, engrossing book on which the film is based. When I was offered the opportunity to attend a sneak preview of the film, I jumped at the chance.

FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, the motion picture, is a tremendous disappointment. The battle scenes on Iwo Jima are extremely well done, but that's it. Unlike the chronological order of the book, which follows the flagraisers from their young adulthood through the battle and their deaths, the film is done in a continuous series of flashbacks and flashforwards, from the battle to the subsequent Bond Tour in the States and back, making it extremely hard to follow the story.

There is little if any character development (in fact, the three flagraisers who later died on Iwo were barely part of the story), unlike the book, where you felt as if you knew each of the characters personally. Some incidents are shamelessly exploited and exaggerated for dramatic effect, and there are lots of little things that add up to major annoyances that detract from the film, such as the Rene Gagnon character having no northern New England accent. (That said, the actor who portrayed Gagnon looked eerily like the real-life Marine's photos).

Worst of all, the screenplay took the very quiet, poignant moment of the author's final visit with his dying father and turned it into a piece of overblown, overwrought piece of Hollwood garbage to conclude the film. I'm surprised James Bradley allowed this to happen.

If you want to truly get the feeling of what the men who invaded Iwo Jima went through, read the book FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, and forget this overhyped, highly forgettable motion picture.",1161302400,,1728,4.907534246575342

I found Eastwoods other film Letters from iwo jima as the superior film. It showed the horrors of war and that many Japanese soldiers question the war and just wanted to be with their families but were forced to fight. And how horrible the imperialist army were to there soldiers and brainwashed them to think that death was better than surrender.
