7992510,5,B00009Q98E,"I ordered this VHS tape years ago; in fact, it was my first yoga tape and turned me on to yoga.  I've been looking for a DVD of this but was unable to find one and could not find a VHS tape until I checked on Amazon.  Am very happy to have been able to bought it because my old one is getting worn.  In fact, I bought two, one for me and one for a friend.  This is definitely a beginners workout, which I think is a good thing.  A lot of my yoga DVDs say they are for beginners but are actually closer to intermediate.  A lot of my friends are 50 plus years old and have various physical problems.  I would not want them to try a hard beginners workout and be turned off from yoga.  I plan on sharing this one with friends new to yoga who are not particularly physically fit.  It is great for relaxation and stress relief too.

Rodney Stryker cues this one well.  There is one other person in the workout who modifies the workout.  Great for beginners!  Great for those who haven't worked out for a while.  Great for stress relief!  Great for days you're tired and don't feel like working out but want to do SOME kind of a workout!",1437436800,,1131,4.077272727272727

But to my pleasant surprise, I found that Rod teaches in a relaxed, easy-going style that was a perfect fit for me. The DVD actually contains two practices, each just under 30 minutes, that can be performed either separately or combined for a longer practice (this format as well as the general feel of the practice is very similar to Kripalu Yoga Gentle). Rod and a student, Ingrid, perform the practice in a pretty mountaintop field area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Rod instructs via voiceover, and Ingrid frequently displays modifications of the poses. In general, Rod performs several flowing repetitions of each posture followed by a longer hold, which gave the practice a viniyoga feel to me.

The first practice, which is about 28 minutes long, begins in a reclined position with a focus on breathing. Some simple stretches follow, including knee-to-chest, revolved stomach pose, cat/cow, and a kneeling shoulder stretch. Rod continues with a few more stretches in a standing position: standing forward bend, arm circles, and a neck stretch. He then moves into a standing pose series, returning to mountain pose for stabililty between each standing posture. The poses consisted of triangle, warrior 1, a wide-legged down dog/standing forward bend combination, and modified revolved triangle. He then returns to the floor for additional cat/cow stretches, down dog, a rest in child pose, and then final relaxation. During the relaxation, which lasts for several minutes, Rod asks you to meditate on the number 12 and then slowly count backward, with each number bringing you closer to perfection.

You can either stop your practice at this point or continue with the second practice, which flows right into bridge pose. Next, he moves into a lying face-down position for some back extension work and then back to a reclined position for hand-to-foot pose, lying twist, and reclined bound angle. Transitioning to a seated postion, you'll perform a seated forward bend, bound angle, and then move into relaxation pose. This time, Rod asks you to visualize various parts of your body smiling, eventually moving to imagining your entire body smiling; I found these visualizations to be beneficial. The relaxation again lasts for several minutes, and then the final six minutes of this practice is devoted to pranayama (breathing) and seated meditation. From a seated position, you will first perform a variation on alternate nostril breathing and then spend several minutes just sitting quietly, bringing the total time for the second practice in at about 26.5 minutes.

Options on the DVD include selecting chapters, choosing to perform the practice from the modified perspective, and an interview/biography of Rod. I enjoyed Rod's gentle teaching style, and even though I was already very familiar with all of the poses included in this video, I found his alignment reminders to be helpful. All of the postures on this DVD would be accessible to beginners (although prior familiarity with the poses would be helpful), but I think that all levels of yoga practitioners will find something to like in this soothing, relaxing practice.

One final note: this same practice is available on DVD under the name ""Yoga for Longevity.""",1129680000,4,3396,5.135623869801085
