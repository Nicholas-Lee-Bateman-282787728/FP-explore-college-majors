1222216,5,B00000IC87,"When ""The Lucille Ball Show"" ran on TV in the 1960's, it was one of the highest rated comedy shows.  On occasion, Lucy would have a guest on the show which would boost ratings throught eh stratosphere.  Since Lucy was a blockbuster Hollywood presence, she was able to haul in the ""heavy-hitters"" and in this case it is John Wayne George Burns, Milton Berle, and Don Rickles.  I bought the DVD for the John Wayne segment as I watched it as a child of perhaps 12 years old, and recalled it to be one of my favorites.  It has not lost its charm.  John Wayne is as big a star as ever, and his screen presence on the ""small screen"" of television does not diminish his visual impact.  He made this episode with Lucy while filmimg his movie ""The War Wagon"" with Kirk Douglas.  The set the episode was filmed on looks very much like the War Wagon set (a bar room), adn could be the same one.  The episode with Lucy culminates with a funny bar room brawl where Lucy gets personally involved!  This episode has lost none of its comedic impact throught he years and is as entertaining as ever; it is a must for the John Wayne collector.

1222217,4,B00000IC87,"As I am the first reviewer for these discs I will try to give as many details as I can to help you decide whether to purchase or not.

There are 30 episodes on 3discs of The Lucy Show, Lucille Ball's second major series. They are divided into Disc 1 - Lucy The Troublemaker, Disc 2 - Lucy And Friends, and Disc 3 Lucy's Wacky Adventures. The box says that the episodes has been ""Re-Mastered For Best Possible Picture Quality"" but I don't know about that. The picture quality is OK. It seems like it is just as it was in the '60s only being watched on a better TV set than at that time. It is very bright at times! But it is certainly watchable so this shouldn't put you off. The sound is fine.

All but two of the episodes are from season 5 and 6 (1966/1967). The other two being from the first season meaning we don't really get a good overview of the whole series and how it progressed, including not seeing Lucy's first boss Mr. Barnsdhal (Charles Lane) or Candy Moore which was disappointing.

Each disc also contains Radio Highlights of Lucy in 'My Favorite Husband' together with lots of Photos.

In my opinion, a 'must buy' for all Lucy lovers (especially considering the incredibly low price for what it is!). My only disappointment, together with the fact that they were nearly all from the same period, is that there were too many special guests. Too often Lucy takes a secondary and often straight-man role when a special guest takes centre stage (this was definately the case with the 'Here's Lucy' box set which had a very poor episode selection). The best episodes are the ones that pretty much just contain Lucy and the regulars and concentrate on them alone. (For example, the one with George Burns was totally boring as the scripts are often limited in such cases, but when Viv and Lucy put in a shower it is a laugh a second!).

Hope this has helped you decide!",1124496000,72,3430,3.9809104258443466

1222220,4,B00000IC87,"the first entry of this two-show tape is a very funny meeting of Lucy with comedian George Burns,their personalities seeming
to click very well indeed. This,however,is really yet another variation of the 'Lucy meets famous Hollywood star and gets into show business' formula but very entertaining nonetheless. My only complaint is the soft shoe number Miss Ball does with Burns at the end of the show. It doesn't add much to what comes before and ,although Ilove Lucy she was never much of a song and dance woman. Still,4 stars for this first half hour.  The Milton Berle  episode is even better,with the Ball-Berle repartee providing for non stop laughter up to the very end,these two definitely working well together. And if that weren't enough,the
sight of Caesars salad being dumped onto Milton Berle's head alone is worth the price of the two tapes together,a showstopping scene if there ever was one. And Ruta Lee's presence lends itself very nicely to the proceedings at hand. GREAT show. 5 stars for this one.",1010102400,3,1017,4.906976744186046

Lucy is still able to do great physical comedy stunts and look her best in her 50s.  The show is a classic 60s sitcom.  The best shows out of the 30 are Lucy the Bean Queen, Lucy and the Ring-a-Ding-Ding, Lucy Gets a Roommate, Lucy and Carol in Palm Springs, Lucy and John Wayne,  Lucy and the Efficiency Expert, Lucy's Substitute Secretary, Main Street U.S.A., Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard, Lucy Meets the Berles, and of course, Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower.  The other eposides have their moments and are funny excepted for the bizarre Lucy Gets Drafted which has some physical comedy but a ridiculous plot, unless it is saying the government needs help seeing who is a woman or man.  Mooney the Monkey is kind of funny if you ignore the fact Lucy is overworked in this show, but it isn't classic TV.  Lucy shows she still is a #1 entertainer, which is the TV ratings she got in the fall of 1967.  These eposides are:
1. Lucy Meets George Burns

1222272,3,B00000IC87,"While I've long been a fan of Lucy's classic I LOVE LUCY, I have yet to see any of the episodes of her other sitcoms.  I went about correcting that with this set.  The results weren't quite as exciting as I expected.

Turns out that there are 30 episodes of this show that have gone into the public domain.  Bet you can't guess which episodes are here.  We get two from the first season.  Then, Lucy Carmichael (Lucille Ball) and Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) are two formerly married women living together to raise their children.  ""Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower"" especially is downright hilarious.

The other 28 episodes are from the fifth and sixth seasons (mostly fifth).  Here, Lucy has moved to California and is working as a secretary in a bank for Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).  Some of these episodes are pretty funny, like the one where Lucy gets an expensive ring stuck on her finger or gets caught in the draft.  These episodes allowed Lucy to show off her great physical comedy.

The problems with these episodes is often two fold.  One, Mr. Mooney was a one note character.  He's never sympathetic and only there to react to Lucy.  Even then, his only reaction is to get angry at her.  It's funny sometimes, but it needed more.  While Lucy does have a friend she hangs out with, that friend is usually only in a scene or two as  a plot device.  Additionally, these episodes are filled with guest stars like John Wayne, Sheldon Leonard, and George Burns to name a few.  Most of the time, the guest star tends to take over the episode, not really giving us a decent plot.

Honestly, this DVD set doesn't help.  It's rather obvious at times that it was put together from someone's VHS tapes.  The picture quality is poor with lots of grain and dust even in the best pictures.  The color and brightness can fade without warning as well.  The sound is fine, although it doesn't need to be in full surround.  We also get three bits of her old radio show, but it really is hard to get into a five minute clip from a 25 minute story.

Since the show is finally being released in season sets, my best advice is to stay away from this one.",1243382400,,2137,4.398976982097187

The shower and ring shows have Lucy at her physical comedy best parallel anything she did on I Love Lucy.  Lucy and Milton Berle, Lucy and John Wayne are also very funny to watch. In fact almost every show is great with the exception of Lucy Gets Drafted.  Mooney the Monkey is funny if you do not remember that on every other eposide Lucy is not over but underworked.  Main Street U.S.A. is a great tribute to downtown America, which was being replaced by malls during the 1960s.  Lucy and Carol Burnett also appear together twice for great results.

1222276,4,B00000IC87,"This boxed set from St. Clair Vision includes 30 episodes from the long-running comedy series Ms. Ball made after marriage to Desi Arnaz dissolved.  The series' premise evolved over at the years.  At first,  Lucy Carmichael (Ball) was a widowed mother of two sharing a house in Connecticut with her divorced friend Viv Bagley (Vivian Vance) and her children.  In the second season, Lucy took a job as the secretary for stuffed shirt bank manager Theodore Mooney (Gale Gordon) and, two years later, she moved to California with Mr. Mooney, shucking her kids and the rest of the cast in the process.  The emphasis was on Lucy's own brand of slapstick humor and frequently featured bizarre situations or first-rate co-stars - and frequently both.  These shows include two black-and-white episodes from the first season, but most of the episodes come from Season Five and Six when the show was produced in color.

Episodes included in this three-disk boxed set are:

Lucy the Starmaker (Season 6, Episode 4)
Lucy Meets Robert Goulet (6.8)
Lucy Gets a Roommate (5.7)

1222291,5,B00000IC87,"The Lucy Show has been available on DVD for years.  You can usually find the DVDs in Dollar Stores or bargain bins.  Generally, there are 2 to 8 episodes on each disc.  I have spent years trying to collect as many episodes of this show on DVD as I could.  Scouring these terrible quality DVDs, trying to figure out which episodes I had and which ones I needed, I came to the conclusion that there seemed to be just a small number of Lucy Shows available. From that small amount, these independently owned, far from perfect DVD companies just seem to pick episodes at random to release.

Finally, I stumbled upon this collection and realized that these 30 episodes are all that is available of The Lucy Show on DVD at this point.  I purchased this set, hoping that the quality was good enough that I could get rid of my old scattershot Lucy Show DVDs and replace them with this small, comprehensive 3-disc set.  Lo and behold, I was right!  Out of all the different DVD releases I have found of the Lucy Show, this one is by far the best.  Not only does it offer EVERY EPISODE that is available to the public (as of this writing), but it is also by FAR the best in terms of picture and sound quality.  Now, don't get me wrong, the picture and sound are FAR from perfect; these public domain episodes will probably never look as good as the official I Love Lucy and Here's Lucy releases, which are pristine.  Quality is perfectly acceptable, however, and definitely watchable.  Until Paramount, or whoever owns the rights to this series, officially releases it season by season on DVD, this is the best we Lucy fans can get.  Check out some of the other reviews for lists of the episodes; I see no need to take up space with that here since previous reviewers have already done it.  Just know that the HILARIOUS episode Viv Visits Lucy is here on disc 3 and it is worth the price of the set by itself!!!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANY REAL COLLECTOR OF LUCY TV SHOWS AND MEMORABILIA.  IT IS THE BEST WE HAVE FOR NOW!",1178582400,21,2010,4.391891891891892
1222292,5,B00000IC87,"""The Lucy Show"" is the best sitcom of all time and is much underrated. We've all been I Love Lucy'd to death but by the time this show came around Lucille Ball had achieved perfection. It's all here...slapstick, hilarity, physical comedy. For fans of this show you will love it. If you have never seen it you will fall in love with it.",1174089600,3,335,4.333333333333333
1222293,5,B00000IC87,"Deciding which Lucy Show set is the best set on Amazon at the best price, look no further this is the set to buy because you get it all. This set is the cheapest and you get more episodes! Why? I don't know.

 This set contains all 30 epiodes that have been released on dvd, because there has only been 30 episodes that have been put out on dvd so far and that is what you get here is the complete shows. I wish they would start making them by the Season's and hopefully they will soon, so that we can own all of the shows in a digitally remastered version.

 The quality of these dvd's are ok and they are not the worse that I have seen of ""The Lucy Show"" but they are no where near remastered. Amazon has several sets of ""The Lucy Show"" dvd's but this one is defintely the best set to buy, as some dvd's on here you only get 8 episodes for more than this costs and the quality is not better than this set. Don't get ripped off! Again you get every episode that is out on the market of ""The Lucy Show"" for a very low cost at a pretty good quality. I was very impressed with these shows when I got them home!! I almost didn't pay attention while ordering online and I would have bought the 8 episodes for fifeteen bucks which costs more than this set and you get less episodes, it is also for sale on Amazon as others that are not as good as this set.

This collection also has my favorite episode where Lucy and Viv put in a shower and get locked in and the water fills up, this is a laugh out loud fun episode! You will get some of both The Lucy and the kids episodes and the Lucy and Mr. Mooney episodes! Here are all the great episodes that come in this set, I am still amazed at this great price on Amazon for all the episodes that are included.

1222294,2,B00000IC87,"The Lucy Show will probably be released on DVD in season packages someday.  At this time what is available is a ridiculous number of `best of' collections.  This dirt-cheap collection is one option, if you want a large dose of the wacky redhead.  Unfortunately the video quality is very poor, comparable to bad VHS.  Images are blurry, flat and oversaturated.  While the quality is horrible, you do get 30 episodes on 3 DVD's for a low price.

For fans, the episodes should bring back some warm memories.  Lucy had wonderful chemistry with her costars, having worked with them before.  Spunky Vivian Vance was a comic genius in her own right.  Though sometimes a reluctant participant, Viv still found herself taking part in Lucy's nuttiest schemes.  Gale Gordon was wonderful as Lucy's boss, Mr. Mooney.  Beneath the vanity and gruff bluster, you always knew was a pretty good guy.  Gordon seemed to really enjoy over the top, physical comedy.  Later, quirky Mary Jane Croft replaced Viv as Lucy's sidekick.

Though no `best of' collection will satisfy every fan, most of these episodes are among the more memorable ones.  The problem here is that the emphasis is a bit too heavy towards the later episodes in the series.  Just two are from the period when Viv and Lucy's kids were on the show.  The episodes from the early years are almost entirely omitted.  A little more balance would have been nice.  The standout episodes are:

Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower.  Always a `do it yourselfer', Lucy and Viv attempt to save money by installing a shower.  Needless to say, the project is an overflowing disaster.  A truly classic Lucy and Viv misadventure.

Lucy meets John Wayne - Few but Lucy could get `The Duke' to appear on a TV sitcom.  Lucy disrupts production on movie set, contributing the immortal line `Pushing up daisies', before being asked to leave.

Main Street USA - A celebration of America's small towns, Lucy leads the fight to preserve a way of life.

Lucy Gets Caught in the Draft - Victim of a draft board mix up, `Lou C Carmichael' is told to report for Army induction.

Lucy Meets Robert Goulet - Lucy enters a friend in a Robert Goulet look alike contest, submitting a life-sized cowboy photo.

Lucy Gets Jack Benny's Account:  The famous funny man was a close friend and frequent guest on Lucy's various projects.  This episode plays up Benny's reputation as a compulsive tightwad.

Lucy Meets the Berles:  In this classic, Lucy gets hired as Uncle Miltie's housekeeper.  Overhearing Berle rehearsing a script with lovely Ruta Lee, Lucy believes that he is cheating on his wife, and takes action.

Lucy the Bean Queen - Never one to pass up a good deal, Lucy takes advantage of a double your money back refund offer on canned beans, to raise cash to buy furniture.  Aided by Mary Jane, Lucy corners the local canned bean market.

The numerous `best of' collections for The Lucy Show often feature the same episodes, so compare them carefully before you buy.  In this case, weigh the poor quality against the low price for 30 episodes.  Lucy's fans might also want to look at the compilation for Here's Lucy, which features 24 remastered episodes, bonus material, and extensive commentaries by Lucy's kids, Lucille Arnaz Luckinbill and Desi Arnaz Jr.  Very well done, this set is fabulous.  Hopefully both The Lucy Show, and Here's Lucy will be available in full season sets of similar quality someday, and make the current best of collections superfluous.",1154304000,22,3479,4.78956228956229

The tracking is terrible,there are many streaks that go up and down the screen,the film quality is terrible,and they changed some of the episode names. I thought that I didn't have some of these episodes,like the one with Frankie Avalon,for example. One company titled it ""Lucy and Frankie Avalon"", while the company that made this collection titled it ""Lucy,the Star-Maker"". Don't be fooled by this company.",1147996800,,479,5.153846153846154

7910572,5,B00000IC87,"""The Lucy Show"" ran in the 1960's and wasn't really a favorite of mine.  But this DVD showcases some of comedienne Lucille Ball's best shows and is very appropriate for family-entertaining.  I especially appreciate it now since I have a family and in lieu of all the reality shows, it is great escapism.  ""Laughter is good medicine for the soul.""  (Proverbs).  My favorite show is ""Lucy Meets Tennessee Ernie Ford.""  My daughters love to join in on the well-choreographed square dance done to ""The Ladies' Auxillary Barn Dance"" and Ernie Ford is hilarious as his ""Homer Higgins"" millionnaire country star character.  ""Lucy and the Law"" is great (and teaches young kids the fallacies of breaking the law and going to jail for it in her own comedic way).  My daughters also loved Lucy's show with Vivian Vance, her old ""Ethel"" character show-mate from ""I Love Lucy"" days.  Their visit to Sunset Strip is hilarious, and my daughters especially loved the take on the 60's style dances, ""The Arrow"" and ""The Rooster.""",1332892800,,1012,4.871345029239766
