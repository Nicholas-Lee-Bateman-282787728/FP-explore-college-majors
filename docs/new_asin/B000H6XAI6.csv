8137275,1,B000H6XAI6,"as others have rightly 'pointed' out: these films are documented tales of 'lies and slander'

if 'aliens' were really 'among us' surely there would be HARD 'evidence by now",1469836800,,172,4.931034482758621
8137276,4,B000H6XAI6,"UFO Chronicles- Aliens on Earth is a two part video presentation that was released in 2015. The first part is a 75 minute interview with Air Force Lt. Colonel Wendelle C. Stevens, who was a highly regarded researcher and amassed one of the largest collections of UFO photos known.  He passed away on September 7th, 2010. Much has been written about him over the years, and all this can be researched on the Internet.  I greatly respect military whistleblowers, especially the ones with an Air Force background.  This Lt. Col. was very well respected by his peers. After I watched his presentation, I had a gut instinct and re-watched the Fastwalkers- UFO and Alien Disclosure DVD from the Safespace Project that was released in 2006. Unfortunately, the Fastwalkers presentation was blasted by the unenlightened in their reviews. On the original Fastwalkers were two parts of his complete interview that was recorded, and now the full interview has been released on this the UFO Chronicles- Aliens on Earth, by Reality Films.  Its a shame that this interview in its entirety never made it to the Fastwalkers Open Files series, which I agree with many of the reviewers back then that the Open Files Volume One through Three presentations were very poorly done with multiple omissions of those who were supposed to be included on the Open Files DVDs.  Even my copy of Fastwalkers Open Files Volume One wouldnt play correctly.  But now, we finally have Lt. Colonel Stevenss complete interview for posteritys sake.  And, its a good one.  This is an interview presentation that was recorded where he tells about his experiences involving extraterrestrials, the history of various U.S. military special programs, and the sightings of aliens, alien craft and their recovery, and more. This is an interview, not a movie with CG thrills. There is a slight sync problem between the audio and his speaking on my DVD.  Yes its a quibble, but its about what he says thats important, and for that Im very grateful to have this material. On the second part of the DVD, they have included the Top 20 Mind-Blowing UFO Cases, which are interesting, but remember that Reality Films is under a budget constraint. You can only do so much with the funding you're allotted. Overall, Im glad I made this purchase, and so will others who enjoy learning from video interviews from those who are trying to expand our awareness of ufology suppression and the continuing cover-up.",1461542400,3,2450,4.912832929782082
8137277,5,B000H6XAI6,"This is the second of the UFO Chronicles that I've watched.  The first UFO Chrnicles I watched was Area 51 Exposed featuring Charles J. Hall.  I was not impressed with Mr. Halls interview.  His claims of being ""chosen"" by Tall White aliens that frequented Area 51 in the 1960's seem fictional at best.  So I watched this version with Lt. Colonel Wendelle C. Stevens as I've heard the Colonel speak before and felt his accounts of the UFO phenomenon were much more credible.  If ever there was a person to be selected as the foremost historically correct ""story teller"" it would be this man.  There isn't a hint of deception in his presenetation and it makes me believe more than ever that we have indeed been visited by beings ""not of this Earth"".  Whether they are from another planet, dimension or parallelity I won't know unless there is a landing or dimensional porthole opened in my backyard.  Because the real evidence we who seek the Truth are looking for just be experienced first hand in order to really know the Truth. But for first hand accounts, this interview is the most convincing so far.  Check it out for yourself.",1446422400,4,1131,4.64321608040201
8137278,2,B000H6XAI6,"This video was interesting, but its laughable to anyone who wants hard evidence or any sort of academic evidence.  The two segments on individuals who believe they are aliens is almost hysterical, and in the end leaves you wondering if you have been duped into purchasing junk.",1231977600,,277,4.8936170212765955
