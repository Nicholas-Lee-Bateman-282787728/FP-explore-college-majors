1690454,3,B000063K0Y,"As a kid growing up in Maryland, long before cable TV reached out into the boonies, we received a total of 5 channels. The three networks of course, and a couple UHF channels, WBFF Channel 45 (now a Fox affiliate)out of Baltimore, and WDCA Channel 20 (now part of MynetworkTV) out of Washington DC. I LIVED on those two UHF channels. They featured everything from the old ""Tarzan"" movies to Kung-Fu theater to syndicated shows like ""Tales from the Darkside"" and ""Friday the 13th: The Series"". But the programming I lived for came on late Saturday night. WBFF had ""The Ghost Host"", a mad-scientist/werewolf dude who creepily introduced bad horror movies, things like ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" and ""The Deadly Mantis"". On WDCA we had ""The Creature Feature"" a similar show, but it starred Count Gor De Vol. Where ""Ghost Host"" went for chills, the Count went for chuckles. I loved these shows, I loved the bad b-movies, I loved the way the hosts would lead us out to commercial, then lead us back to the movie.

Okay, that was a long walk to get to this review, but there is a reason behind my rambling. ""The Alien Factor"" was a mainstay on our UHF channels. This thing would pop up on TV with what I consider it's ""sister film"", and I guess you could call it a sequel, ""Night Beast"", another Don Dohler production shot and filmed here in the Baltimore area. Both are cheesy beyond belief, but if you enjoy B-movies, you will LOVE them. ""The Alien Factor"" actually has a decent little story, and you can tell a bit of thought went into the production. Basically a spaceship carrying zoological specimens crashes in Perry Hall, Maryland. The three aliens escape the wreckage and begin terrorizing the local populace. The big haired sheriff sets out to stop the beasts with his deputy, a local doctor and her nephew are also on hand to help out. Well, they don't actually help do anything, but that is part of the fun. The mayor is worried about a business deal going sour if the aliens aren't stopped, and gets help from a pot-bellied guy from Harford County in stopping the menace.

The special effects are non-existent, but still pretty inventive for a shoe-string sci-fi movie (actually much better than the CGI junk forced down our throats these days!), the acting is strictly dinner theater level, and the music had to have been composed on a late 1970's Casio keyboard....but it all comes together in a perfect B-movie storm.

Maybe it's because I grew up on this movie, and enjoy seeing a Maryland from 30 years ago, long before developers sunk their teeth into the region, and turned every farm and field into a community of yuppie filled McMansions? Maybe it's because the mayor is played by none other than Dick Dyszel..who would later go on to play Count Gor De Vol? Whatever the reason, ""The Alien Factor"" is fun and well worth the rental fee if nothing else.",1252368000,17,2870,4.645669291338582
1690455,4,B000063K0Y,"I remembered watching this movie a lot on TBS when I was a kid.  It's funny how seriously I took it back then, because now, I can only laugh and roll my eyes.

This isn't even a B movie.  It's more like a C movie.

The acting is so wooden, there's a constant threat of it going up in flames.

The plot, such as it is, runs like this:  An alien ship containing man-sized specimens for a space zoo crashes near a small town.  The critters escape and roam the countryside, racking up a body count.  The sheriff is called in, and help arrives from a scientist (with a secret) from the nearby planetarium.

The character of the Mayor is highly concerned that bad press about roaming killer aliens might threaten the towns plans of bringing in an amusement park.  Seriously.

The alien costumes are obviously cheap - mostly latex rubber and fur - but their construction is good for this type of movie.  Special effects are mostly bad explosions, bad stop-motion photography, or ok animation.

If the medical team we see are proof of why we need health care reform.

If you and your friends love to watch movies ""Mystery Science Theater 3000 style,"" this film is PERFECT.  Way better suited than ""This Island Earth.""",1248393600,5,1209,4.532407407407407
1690456,4,B000063K0Y,"Don Dohler's opus, THE ALIEN FACTOR features monsters that remind me of the ""glory"" days of Roger Corman. Though obviously cheaply made, these critters ain't bad at all! The amount of slaughter was actually surprising, and the story was pretty good. I like it when directors w/ no money still manage to (somehow) make enjoyable films. In spite of it's lack of a budget, I did find ALIEN FACTOR to be a lot of fun...",1198886400,11,415,4.546666666666667
1690457,5,B000063K0Y,"Alien Factor has this amazing story about aliens crashing on earth, terrorizing people, getting people to act stupid about handling the problem, and the ending is a huge unexpected twist that got me giggling for days. There were awesome primitive lazer beam effects and a silly yet amusing explanation for many of the bizzare happenings. The best part about the movie was this freakishly tall alien walking on carpet covered stilts. It looked like he was going to tip over any second too. He also had this weird thing with swinging his right hand in a rhythm. Watch as people run in fear at this thing they probably had to help up after filming the scene.

Fiend was awesome too. A simple story about this neighborhood jerk that chokes people to death in order to gain energy to live longer. Nobody suspects him though (even if his murders are done in broad daylight) The one man to stop him is his next door neighbor that hates his loud music. Plenty of trademark Don Dohler cheesy lazer/light effects.

Don Dohler is a genius filmmaker, Nightbeast was rad too and even had some gore. Get familiar with his work, he has his own style (which I can't say about all these replaceable hacks these days) and most of his movies have the same lovable dork actors that use the same names from their previous movies even!",1150243200,,1313,4.6068376068376065
1690458,4,B000063K0Y,"I originally saw Alien Factor on late night movie and cut off the final monster.  Then I was lucky that my local video store had a copy on VHS.  It's a low budget picture, the acting rates from really bad to passbale.  The specail effects are passable considering the budget.  The movie has a lot of energy that makes up for bad effects.  This DVD has extra lost ending of Alien Factor Bloopers and a commentary which is interesting.

 The second film is just okay, the Alien Factor is the main meal and Fiend is just dessert.  It is just okay",1143849600,4,543,4.306930693069307

The Alien Factor is the stuff of Mystery Science Theater - and I'm amazed those guys never got hold of this one.  Horrendous acting, cheap EVERYTHING and an outrageously (and unintentionally) funny stilt-walking monster.  The mere fact this has made it to DVD amazes and mystifies me.

1690460,3,B000063K0Y,"When I was a kid, my brother and I tuned into this movie on TV late one night when we had nothing better to do.  After about 15 minutes of it, the VCR began to roll, along with our tears of laughter.  I don't know if it was that night in particular, or the actual charms of this particular piece of drek, but it still holds a warm place in my heart as possibly THE funniest bad movie I'll ever see.
Not one thing about this movie is well done...the only good thing about it is the sincerity and love with which it was assembled.  The actors are the worst community theatre types, but they go about their ""work"" with no apologies, as though they believe that they are creating the finest Ray Harryhausen epic.  That helps a lot when the ""monsters"" flinch at the gunshots, or stumble on their prosthetic stilts.  If there is a ghost of Ed Wood, he inhabits this film.
If you like making fun of bad movies (or even MAKING bad movies), and have a late night and nothing to fill it, invite a few sarcastic friends over and have the time of your life with this.  It's hard to believe it even exists, let alone on DVD.",1025395200,19,1111,4.192488262910798

Aliens out of control! Humans voraciously attacked by out of this world creatures! You can't lose with this flick! Actually, if you're an insomniac, you won't lose. Those lost hours of sleep will come back during a viewing.
NightBeast was a better version of this flick with most of the same cast.

This Blu-ray is incredible.  The picture is sharp(er) than the dvd version. The only issue if you're a purist,  the aspect ratio was change to letterbox.

The extras are great on this one. I loved the fact they got as many people from the movie to give a few moments to discuss their role in the making of this film.

I truly hope they can do the same on Nightbeast, but it might be pretty much the same thing considering it's 90% of the same cast.

Sadly,  those who are no longer with us didn't get to take part had this been thought of sooner.

What Don Dohler's movies lacked in flash and better writing is more than made up for in heart, despite how bad these films actually are.",1017705600,2,1000,4.396739130434782
1690511,5,B000063K0Y,"BOTTOM LINE: A shoestring budget sci-fi flick from Maryland's own Don Dohler, ALIEN FACTOR is 80 minutes of harmless no budget fun for fans of homemade cinema, and those looking for something other than the usual by-the-numbers Hollywood product. This backyard blockbuster has some okay thrills & chills. Just don't go in expecting too much or you're likely to be disappointed. The terrific, fully-loaded fan-pleasing Blu-ray is a rock solid effort. 5 STARS

THE STORY: An extraterrestrial craft crashlands on the snowy outskirts of the rural New England village of Perry Hill. A trio of antisocial aliens are soon stalking & slaying the hapless locals. A handful of frightened citizens band together to try and fight off the bizarre creatures, with the assistance of an oddball scientist from a nearby observatory, who conveniently shows up to help. Can the deadly menage-a-terror be stopped before everyone in Perry Hill is slaughtered?

THOUGHTS: An cinematic throwback from the 1970's, and do-it-yourself director Don Dohler, who made a side career crafting no budget monster movies with help from his family, friends and other similar-minded film enthusiasts in the Baltimore area. Many kids of a certain age (growing up in the mid-1960's to mid-1980's), with access to their parents' home movie cameras, tried their hand at creating their very own mini-epics. Dohler took his ambitions a few steps further, actually getting his works released theatrically. Armed with his Super 8mm (and later a 16mm) film camera, lots of enthusiasm and no shortage of ideas, one-man-studio Dohler turned his dreams into reality, and gave us some pretty unique movies in the process. Besides ALIEN FACTOR, Dohler also directed the inevitable follow-up, ""ALIEN FACTOR 2, as well as ""FIEND,"" ""NIGHTBEAST,"" ""THE GALAXY INVADER"" and others. While they'll never win any awards, his films are a lot of fun and a charming example of a fast fading period in obscure American independent cinema. Be forewarned however, that like so many films of this type, ALIEN FACTOR is ripe with lousy writing, tepid acting, bad production design, interminable padding (AF is filled with seemingly endless shots of the cast cluelessly wandering around in the snowy woods), and dimestore F/X. But in its defense, ALIEN FACTOR does have a few neat bits in it, and if you have patience, the film isn't without its minimalist rewards.

THE BLU-RAY: Who would have ever dreamed that a zero dollar production like this would ever see legitimate mainstream home video release AND be remastered in the high definition Blu-ray format to boot? Certainly not Dohler. Undoubtedly, he would be tickled to see his works treated so lovingly, getting a whole new lease on life and exposing them to a fresh generation of film goers. The transfer for ALIEN FACTOR is impressive, especially considering that this is a 40 year-old independent film, shot on 16mm. Better than anything I could have imagined. The picture & sound for the film are quite good, all things considered. (The sound level is VERY strong. LOL!) Retromedia & its owner, low budget filmmaker Fred Olen Ray, are to be commended. Being a fellow homebrew cum mainstream director, Fred is obviously a fan of Dohler's works. It's great that he took this project on, and his love for such fare shows here, with a slew of great bonus content that make this Blu-ray a true 5 STAR release. Included are a cast & crew audio commentary track, a behind-the-scenes featurette, gag reel, alternate ""Leemoid"" alien sequence w/commentary, cast reunion footage, some local TV promos for the film, and more! (Please note however, that there are no SDH subtitles for either the film or bonus content, the only strike against this otherwise A+ release.) Ephemeral cinema fans & Z-flick enthusiasts are in for a real treat with the hi-def release of THE ALIEN FACTOR, and it comes highly recommended.",1487376000,7,3897,5.0859375

1690516,5,B000063K0Y,"This movie is not for everyone.  Actually I would only recommend it to someone that is interested in practical special effects and latex monsters or an archivist of movies, like myself, that are weird, unique, or unusual in all senses of those words.  Amateur acting and script with some cool real in camera old timey monster suited horrors.  For what it is and what it represents its spot on and cool to see what Don Dohler and his crew of friends were able to do with no money and some talent.",1470873600,3,495,4.417582417582418
1690517,5,B000063K0Y,"Considering that this release is now sold out, less than two months after its release, recommending it might seem a futile gesture. That said, this release should put Retromedia on the map for any collector of low budget 70's horror. If you gobbled up Stephen Thrower's masterful Nightmare USA, this release was for you. For a movie shot on 16mm, it looks surprisingly good. Audio, while not pristine, is strong enough for the dialogue to be intelligible. The extras are comprehensive, including behind-the-scenes stuff about the various aliens.

Now, is The Alien Factor a great movie? Not exactly, but I still had a blast with it. The aliens are creatively conceived even if verisimilitude isn't in the picture. Don Leifert has presence enough to carry the largely amateur cast. Ambitions obviously overreach the budget and talent involved, but the whole thing is so enthusiastic that I found myself smiling at and forgiving the imperfections. It's not for everyone, but before some says ""worst movie ever,"" I say: ""Check out Alien Beasts first. Then we'll talk.""

1690553,5,B000063K0Y,"I have to say, this limited edition Blu Ray is very impressive and features a bright, crisp, VIBRANT new transfer from the 16mm negative (struck, I am assuming, from the reversal positive)..  If you're looking to get some version of this movie at all, then you already probably know something about it, you know, probably, that this is a ""backyard sci-fi epic"" filmed in Baltimore in the 1970's, it features monster suits and optical effects and a dizzily preposterous storyline, not to mention charming enthusiastic performances from many actors local to the Baltimore area.  I imagine John Waters must get a kick out of this flick.  Spaceship from who knows where crash-lands in snowy forest, bunch of weird alien monsters escape and begin to wreak havoc, mysterious stranger appears in the town claiming to be interested in the possible meteorite crash he thinks may have taken place up in the hills.  Before you can say ""Jinkies,"" a monster hunt is underway.  This is a fine film created by Don Dohler (editor of Cinemagic Magazine) and his cohorts.  What it is lacking in budget it makes up in entertainment value.  Giddy silliness abounds.  A lot of the fun comes from the fact that this was made by an almost totally non-professional crew of amateurs, and the locations are pretty much the filmmaker's woodsy backyard or any building, house, or business they could use for free.  So ""The Alien Factor"" definitely has that ""Let's put on a show!  I can make the costumes!"" atmosphere.  And that, of course, is what Cinemagic Magazine was all about.  It stands to reason, therefore, that if you enjoyed reading Cinemagic Magazine back in its day, and if you were one of those neighborhood people running around with a home movie camera making your own rough-edged backyard epics and maybe sending photos and production notes to Cinemagic Magazine (hoping they would list your stuff on their ""Productions"" pages), if you are one of THOSE people, you will have a special appreciation for the charm of this film and for the transfer that allows it to be seen and heard in such clarity.  And you will forgive the clunky performances and endlessly cheesy dialogue.  No:  You will enjoy it BECAUSE of the clunky performances and the endlessly cheesy dialogue.  You and your pals might even be laughing all the way through it.  And then will come the sobering reflection that the last several times you bought a movie ticket to see some major studio flick that cost 200 million dollars, you weren't laughing or enjoying yourself anywhere near this much.  The people who made this movie did it largely with their own personal resources, and all contributed to the film because it was what they WANTED to be doing.

It seems reasonable to mention, at this point, that this limited-run special edition is obviously for serious low-budget sci-fi geeks--and it is not intended for, nor is it likely to satisfy, the typical mainstream moviegoer.  I give it five stars very enthusiastically, but not because it is a good example of a normal, popular film.  As has been mentioned elsewhere, the monsters in this film actually are decent considering their budget.  But this is very low-rent genius, and the fact remains that one of the monster suits (the cockroach-looking ""Inferbyce"") is made largely of cardboard and papier-mache.  Oh, they textured it and painted it and did their best to detail it.  But it's still made mostly out of cardboard.  Still interested?  Good.  How often do you see a person attacked in the wilderness by a guy in a cardboard monster suit?

Disc features lots of extras (many created by star George ""See this pencil line???"" Stover, who lent a great deal of his time and effort to producing material for the special features, and who pieced together and edited a lengthy commentary track featuring interview clips with many people in the cast and crew--the George Stover who apparently signed 1000 paper cover inserts to please the adoring fans...this limited edition is really a ""George Stover showcase,"" so if you're a fan of his, take note);  There's a section featuring a LOT of featured actor Dick Dyszel promoting the film as ""Count Gore DeVol"" on his Creature Features program, so if you like Count Gore or just horror hosts in general, you are taken care of here.  In other words, if you are the type of person who appreciates that special joy that comes from paying LOTS of attention to obscure low-budget efforts, you have my personal permission to proceed to geek out, beginning now.

The impressive transfer, which is the glue that holds this whole production together, deserves a lot of praise.  I don't think any fan of this fairly obscure film ever expected in his/her wildest sci-fi nerd dreams that we would ever be able to view such a crystal-clear version. This is very likely the best the film may ever look.",1467244800,11,4847,4.844660194174757

The image quality of this release is light years better than the previously DVD release, which was a bit flat, dark, under saturated, and very grainy.  The images in this blu ray are bright, very sharp, and virtually grain free. Some of the flesh tones are a bit red, and many of the actors are walking around with red noses, but this is because it was very, very cold when we shot the exteriors on this film.  We shot the film on very slow speed, fine grained 16mm ektachrome reveral film, mostly with my Bolex SBM.  I never understood why the older releases looked so bad.

My vhs video has vibrant color, studio quality picture that looks like it was remastered back then.  It is literally 10 times the quality of the dvd in every aspect.  The DVD has Washed out color, terrible graininess, is darker, has some kind of interference that comes and goes in the scratchy picture.  A guy was selling his Media VHS on Ebay for 50 bucks, and he didn't even know what he had or he would have mentioned the incredible difference in quality!  Nobody bought it, because they didn't know about this vast difference in quality.  So since nobody will pay what the VHS is worth, and they would rather settle for the cheap dvd, I'm going to just sit back and enjoy my 100% better quality and you all can eat your hearts out.  That is, unless you'd like to buy this tape for 50 bucks, just kidding.  Seriously though, I'd list it on Amazon, but they don't even have a record of it for selling.

The Alien Factor will be the draw for most here, as it's a very ambitious low-budget gem with some delirious-looking monsters and acting chops that cannot be found elsewhere. The plot gets pretty involved from time to time, and I got wrapped in it before I knew it.

Fiend was completely weird and at times, ultra-creepy. I almost ended up liking it better than The Alien Factor, but then again, it's hard to gauge a Don Dohler film as they all have a certain, unique kind of charm to them. In this one, the suburban couple who live across the street from the Fiend spend time showing genuine affection for one another, which I didn't expect in a movie as strangely-themed as this one. It really set it apart, and that made it memorable.

Hopefully more of the man's cinematic achievements will continue to appear. There is a definite style to these films and they made me smile a lot, not an easy accomplishment in these days and times.",1519344000,,1262,4.478260869565218

7959341,3,B000063K0Y,"Really ambitious, yet really bad.  Honestly, as bad as it is, I was also sort of impressed by the ambition behind it.

Making his very first ultra-low budget film, writer/director Don Dohler (Nightbeast, Galaxy Invader, The Alien Factor 2) has produced something that is equal parts boring and amusingly hokey.  In this clunky 77-minute flick, a spaceship transporting alien creatures from distant galaxies crashes on Earth. After the creatures escape and wreak havoc on the locals, a mysterious pseudo-scientist shows up to help.

As simple as this plot may sound, its more elaborate than youd expect.  And with such an obviously meager budget, Im shocked Dohler created multiple monsters instead of just one.  This hokey monster movie features an insectoid-humanoid creature, a stilt-legged orangutan-bigfoot with beetle mandibles, a rogue ball of energy, a couple more monstrous humanoids, and a giant lizard monster which was the pinnacle of bad effects (i.e., faded rotoscoping of the monster attacking a man whose reactions don't match the monster).

Despite the abject quality of it all, I find myself admiring Dohlers ambition.  The monsters are all dumb, but a lot of work went into them and they're all full-body pieces.

Not only were there numerous monsters that all find much screen time (however poorly executed), we also have a plot thats much more complicated than one typically finds among such B-movie fare.  A sort of UFO hunter/cryptozoologist shows up to help the sheriff wrangle the monsters; one monster is killed by a projectile syringe after a dozen bullets failed to pierce its hide; we never really get into the energy-based lifeform (I guess its just there to show how open-minded the writing was); a dying monster uses telepathy to help the humans; and, in the end, a peaceful alien is killed without cause as if to sprinkle in some allegory.

All things said, this was terrible and most of the time painfully boring as we suffer through the dialogue.  However, a lot of work went into this and, in the right company, I think the diversity of bad monsters could offer some rich bad movie night entertainment.",1515888000,,2137,5.0397727272727275

How the heck did mainstream blockbusters like The Empire Strikes Back and Jaws make it into Michael Weldon's book, The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film (1987), but not Don Dohler's epic low-budget masterpiece, The Alien Factor?

The Alien Factor is a mother lode for fans of low budget b-movie sci-fi and horror. It's got it all (except nudity). There's no nudity in The Alien Factor. Don Dohler was a family man, you drooling, trench coat wearing cretins.

If you're looking for skin and gore, check out his other film, Nightbeast. Lloyd Kaufman of Troma coaxed him into spicing it up, ""because it's what the kids want and the audience dictates the market"". Blah-Blah-Blah

Yeah, I'm a fan of Nightbeast too, so get off my back.

Anyway, The Alien Factor. It's an ambitious labor of love, full of endearing imperfections. It's a bona fide cult classic (and I don't use that term lightly).

Don Dohler was a guy outside the system who dreamed of making movies. He set his mind and heart to work and made his dreams reality. In that sense, his films are a success. But his movies are also entertaining, maybe not in the exact way he intended, but they are entertaining. This also makes them a success.

Big studios frequently spend hundreds of millions of dollars on films cynically orchestrated to be huge money makers, but they end up being boring flops. Those films are the true failures.

You can keep your Marvel superhero movies and all the other CGI-fests Hollywood excretes on what seems like a weekly basis.

I'll keep watching these quirky old cinematic oddities like The Alien Factor. They have heart and soul that money just can't buy.

Cheers, Don Dohler, wherever you are.",1506124800,3,1763,4.769736842105263

Later, Dohler would fine-tune his craft with classic gems such as Nightbeast and The Galaxy Invader (which are both currently streaming on Prime). Dohler truly loved sending aliens to wreak havoc on small, defenseless country towns. Fans of this film might also want to check out the riffed version by Cinematic Titanic (ex-crew of MST3K). Shout Factory recently released the entire CT library in one DVD set, and it's great. Alien Factor was probably their best riffing session of the bunch.",1502755200,,551,4.935483870967742
