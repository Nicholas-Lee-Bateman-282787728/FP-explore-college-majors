8604385,4,B00EE149Y4,"excellent non-Godzilla movie but man almost a 100 dollars!!!  with no English subs. man I honestly just got done watching the Japanese BLURAY version with superb crisp video and  precise solid white English subs. just go to showavideo.com and pay under 30 dollars which includes 2 day priority shipping. the bluray is amazing but the included dvd English dub version is an AWFUL video quality version. I let showavideo.com have it because they are the go to site for getting the true 2014 ""redone"" Godzilla movies ALLLL in bluray and some are double discs like king kong vs Godzilla in bluray the original Japanese version w English subs which you cannot get in region 1 (basically in north America) and it also has the imo the awffuull universal American version in bluray. I told showa that why would you even release a disc like yog monster from space (English sub dvd) that had such poor picture quality. I had never received anything but grade A 110% crisp picture and sound quality and I told showa some people already are afraid to deal with ""ur kind of site"" why would you even include that kind of quality?? I was embarrassed for them!!! I have purchased all the unavailable Godzilla bluray movies like gigantis...kk vs Godzilla original jap. vers...mothra vs Godzilla...ghidorah the 3 headed monster...invasion of the astro monster...can't get myself to buy Godzilla's revenge ha ha!!....Godzilla vs mechagodzilla 74 and terror of mecha-g all in bluray plus war of the gargantuas...mothra 61...great site my friends.",1474848000,,1526,5.003937007874016
