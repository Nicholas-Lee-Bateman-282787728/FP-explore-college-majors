8043164,4,B0006TPG18,"This is great music from a group of great musicians, and I'm particularly a big fan of Greg Howe and Dennis Chambers.  I enjoyed this DVD and recommend it if you like fusion, but I have a couple gripes which drop my rating to 4 stars.  First, the mix puts the guitar too much in the background, even during solos, of often makes the guitar sound a bit thin.  Second, I felt that the keyboardist wasn't treated like a full member of the band and allowed to shine like the others, which bothered me given that he did a great job.  Again, these aren't huge enough flaws that they ruined my enjoyment, but I do think they're noteworthy.",1385337600,,632,4.330508474576271
8043165,5,B0006TPG18,The guys are just having fun. Good for them.,1247356800,,44,4.0
8043166,5,B0006TPG18,"I bought the cd and it's excellent jazz fusion. I want the dvd because it contains alternate cuts from the cd but I am not willing to pay a buck and a quarter for the privelige. I can see no reason why this item is discontinued by the manufacturer when the law of supply and demand shows that this commodity is commanding a premium. If the supplier doesn't wise up, I'm in the market for a bootleg.",1245628800,,398,4.181818181818182
8043167,5,B0006TPG18,"I've been a fan of Greg Howe for a number of years, own all of his solo albums, and only recently became familiar with this project after discovering some video clips on youtube. These guys totally blow me away! I'd never heard of Tetsuo Sakurai (bass) or Akira Onozuka (keys). (Evidently the former has been playing fusion in Japan for 20 years, and, judging by his chops, deserves to be in every fusion fan's vocabulary). Dennis Chambers,... duh! 'Nuf said.

I won't babble on about every single song. Suffice it to say that if you liked Greg's last disc, ""Extraction"", with Victor Wooten and Dennis Chambers, then you'll love this. Yes, the cost* is a bit prohibitive, but if you can afford it, it's worth it.

*By the way, I did not shell out $160 for this. I got it on the Laser's Edge website for $50.  Still a bit steep, but a heck of a lot better than $160.  Do I regret spending $50 for it?  Not at all.  It was money well spent, as far as I'm concerned.",1183507200,4,963,4.322222222222222
