4445623,2,B004QL7K6G,"When a pair of New Yorkers are unexpectedly unemployed, they set out for his brother's home in Georgia. There is an entertaining travel montage: they sing, argue, sleep, and take turns driving. They stay for one pleasant night at ""Elysium,"" a Utopian camp along the way, but continue on to the home of the successful brother and his semi-catatonic wife. It doesn't take long for us to understand why she is in that condition; he is hateful, short-tempered, rude and selfish. Our horrified couple flees back to the Utopian camp.

Just let me caution you: This is a Judd Apatow-produced movie, so some of you shouldn't read any further because there will be raunch, nudity, profanity, nudity, fart jokes, nudity, diarrhea jokes, and a whole herd of elderly nudists running down a hill toward the camera. Get the DVD from Amazon.com so you can fast forward!

If you're gonna go there, these are the folks you'll meet:
  * Paul Rudd (""Our Idiot Brother"") is the hapless New Yorker who is commanded to experience free love with a beautiful blonde. You won't expect his reaction.
  * Jennifer Aniston (""Horrible Bosses"") is the distaff side of the unemployed couple. She isn't too bad in this one.
  * Justin Theroux (""Your Highness"") is the spokesman and guru for the commune. He gets dibs on our heroine right away!
  * Alan Alda (""Tower Heist"") is one of the founding members of the commune. If only he could remember where he put that deed!
  * Ken Marino (lots of TV) is that vile brother. Marino is also one of the scriptwriters.
  * Joe Lo Truglio (""Paul"") is the first person they meet at the commune. We see a LOT of Joe! (Remember I mentioned nudity?)

By the time we have explored ""free love"" and all the eccentricities and hypocrisies of the various occupants, I found myself becoming more and more impatient, so I was happy when our hero finally pops his cork and tells them off. He speaks for all of us and we agree with him wholeheartedly.

Paul Rudd is a handsome, capable actor who has found himself in a bit of a rut. He is evidently a great improviser and I suspect his scene talking dirty to himself in the mirror was improvised. I'm sure the crew was cracking up (I wasn't!); the screening audience of young adults loved it.

At least Jennifer Aniston was able to cast her boyfriend (Justin Theroux) in this one...sigh... Okay, I'll admit it. I laughed out loud...once....",1334275200,2,2387,4.645238095238096
4445624,5,B004QL7K6G,I don't understand how everyone seemed to hate this movie.  It was typical Paul Rudd. If you are a fan of his acting style and comedy you will like this movie. I really enjoyed it and have been wanting to see it again since I seen it in the theater.,1332720000,20,249,3.98
4445625,2,B004QL7K6G,"Paul Rudd must have a particular fondness for hippies because he seems to love either playing them or playing off them. They make for relatively easy laughs and breezy comedies, similar to Rudd's performance as the free-spirited moron in last year's Our Idiot Brother. Hippies are fun, and they make for relatively soft targets for a likable actor like Rudd. Wanderlust, the latest comedy from the Judd Apatow umbrella, has Rudd paired up with a familiar face in Jennifer Aniston. Even though the two haven't done a movie together since 1998's The Object of My Affection, they spent plenty of time together on the set of Friends. Their chemistry together is on point, and the bulk of the film's laughs come between one another. Separately, Wanderlust succumbs to a drowsy script that can't overcome the slight plot.

George(Rudd) and Linda(Aniston) are a seemingly happy married couple devoted to the idea of setting up their lives in bustling New York City. He's a businessman of some sort, while she just seems to be drifting from career to career. At this point she wants to be a documentary film maker....about penguins with terminal cancer. It doesn't go well. But their commitment is strong, and are pushed by a hilariously unscrupulous real estate agent(Linda Lavin!!) into buying a high priced ""micro-loft"", which turns out to be a closet sized studio apartment. George almost immediately loses his job, whatever it was, and unable to afford the lifestyle, they find themselves headed to Atlanta to stay with his scummy but successful brother(Ken Marino).

Disaster strikes during the interminable road trip, in the form of a hairy nudist(Joe Lo Truglio) and his floppy man sack chasing them into a freak accident. Forced to stay at the ironically named Elysium Bed & Breakfast, they discover that it's actually a hippie commune, or as its leader Seth(Justin Theroux) calls it, an ""intentional community"".  The big city folks quickly fall in love with the relaxed nature and the close-knit bonds forged among the denizens, and after a wild night of drinking, pot smoking, and being treated like beatnik royalty, George and Linda feel they've found a new home.

No more stress, no more reliance on technology, and no more barriers. Basically every hippie joke you can think of becomes an instant factor, whether it's farm animals turning up in the oddest places, wacky acid trips, and shocking infringements on one's personal space. It's all stuff you've seen before, but Rudd and an excellent supporting cast do their best to make it work. You know from the start that Seth has his eyes on Linda, who is acclimating to the group better than George ever could hope to. You know where it's going, but Theroux shines as the manliest guy in a town full of pacifists.

Rudd nearly saves the day, however, especially as George's perceptions of the group begin to shift from enthusiastic follower to caustic observer. Tempted by a free lovin' sex pot(Malin Akerman), George is willing to give up good food, bathroom privacy, and his favorite local coffee to give the lifestyle a shot. If only Rudd help from a better script, one which wasn't so devoted to skit show cliches. Too often the film feels razor thin, like screenwriters Ken Marino and director David Wain came up with the idea on the fly to do a hippie movie, but never got past the conceptual stage. Basically, it's like they just assembled a talented group of comedic heavyweights and said ""Have at it"". Not everybody is capable of making chicken salad out of chicken crap the way Rudd can, and unfortunately too many scenes don't work for that very reason. It's sad to watch the great Alan Alda wasting away with a one-note bit that is never funny, yet repeated over and over again as if we'll suddenly change our minds about it. Sometimes that works, but not often.

A look at the trailers for the film show a number of scenes that were apparently left on the cutting room floor, which makes the inclusion of some of the worst jokes utterly confusing. George's excruciating, profanity-laden attempts to psych himself up for some guilt free sex is a serious low point. It's only matched by a mother who gives birth to a baby right at George's feet, then proceeds to lug the placenta around like luggage. Why is this funny?

Nearly all of the offensively lame attempts at humor come in the second half of the film, when it appears that Wain and Co. basically threw in the towel. For the first hour or so, Wanderlust moves at a solid pace, letting it's two charming leads tell what was a clever fish-out-of-water story. Too bad it all vanishes in a puff of smoke.",1332288000,,4626,4.8040201005025125
4445626,4,B004QL7K6G,"I was reading snippets from numerous critics about this movie after watching it and I was surprised to find several panning it because it wasn't funny.  I get the fact that some people could be offended by the language, ""sexy talk"" and plenty-o-nudity but not funny?  Then I remembered how much I hated ""Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie.""

As I think back a few hours about this movie I would argue that it might be just another comedy if not for the brilliance and comedic genius of Paul Rudd.  Yes, Jennifer Aniston seems to get more beautiful as she gets older and yes, she has her moments (including one involving pixilated boobs) but this is Rudd's movie.  He plays George and is married to Linda (Aniston).  They live in New York City.  After several unsuccessful career moves, Linda makes a pitch to HBO to show a documentary she produced about testicular cancer in penguins.  Pretty funny concept right there.  She's turned down.

George is a successful business executive in the financial sector.  As the CEO of his firm is perp-walked away in handcuffs for some form of SEC malfeasance, George loses his job.  All of this comes the day after they movie into their brand new micro-loft studio apartment.  In route to Atlanta in their aging Honda, where George's brother Rick (co-writer Ken Marino) has promised a job, they stumble upon a bed and breakfast where they hope to stay for the night.  Located in northern Georgia, it is actually a commune community where characters of all stripes are in residence.  In spite of their differences, George and Linda enjoy their stay but must move on to Atlanta.

After a night or two in Rick and Marisa's (Michaela Watkins) suburban home, they've had enough (Rick is an A-hole and Marisa is always drunk or drugged) and head back to the commune.  While, the comedy is a bit uneven at times, Rudd manages to rescue every scene he's in.  In one of the funniest bits I've ever seen, George readies himself for a sexual liaison with Eva (Malin Akerman).  Even with his wife's blessing, George has second thoughts so tries to pump himself up in front of a mirror.  He goes through several minutes of clearly unscripted riffs about how he's going to perform.  Using one clichd macho term after another, I couldn't stop laughing.  It continues when he gets to the bedroom and actually confronts Eva.  He promises what she is going to experience which goes on until she is no longer interested.  I imagine this scene took forever to shoot and how Akerman kept a straight face is amazing itself.

This movie is not for the prudish.  It includes full frontal nudity, some of which you really don't want to see (aging nudists running!), crude banter (sexual and otherwise) and some disgusting remnants of childbirth.  This is a very funny film.",1330819200,29,2788,4.7184265010351965
4445627,3,B004QL7K6G,"While it does not reach the apex of bizarro comedic genius attained by David Wain's cult classic Wet Hot American Summer, Wanderlust, penned by Wain and Ken Marino (Party Down), inspires enough laughs to allow its tepid plot to be overlooked, due in large part to the committed performances of its leads--notably Rudd, whose sexual-pump-up speech is one for the ages, proving that simple anatomy can be ridiculously funny when flowing from the right mouth. Other actors, like Marino, seem annoyingly misplaced and more than a few gags are clumsy, but ultimately this shaggy dog of a film rears its head in profane, gleeful confusion enough times to endear itself to you. Devotees of the cerebral and short-lived Stella will rejoice.
 The wavering plot concerns George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston), two New York up-and-comers whose lives are derailed by virtually spontaneous unemployment. The two have recently purchased a miniature apartment referred to as both a ""studio"" and ""micro-loft,"" depending on the whims of their avaricious and unhinged realtor. The apartment is the sort of place where the bed drops down from the wall and the addition of both a couch and an armchair would result in over-crowding. The New York scenes resound with satirical validity and are over perhaps too soon, resulting in a quasi-road picture vs. hippie-commune subplot that gradually grows to assimilate all other story threads. Pacing is Wanderlust's general flaw, with several scenes running too long--particularly those at Ken Marino's suburban hell castle which could have been handled during less intrusive (and plot-stalling) telephone conversations since watching grown men prance about smashing plates to express their ennui and women drinking into oblivion have been beaten to death and beyond in lesser movies.
 Wanderlust flounders when the action is confined to the hippie commune. Many subplots jump in and out including one in which a thoroughly gaunt and wheelchair bound Alan Alda attempts to remember where he kept the deed to the commune, as vague land developers appear to have their eye on repossessing it. The best scenes are the ones which seem hijacked by David Wain and rise above cliche set-ups. Most of these include a hardly recognizable Justin Theroux whose attempts to free George's mind during an arm-swinging yoga session results in fabulous wordplay from Rudd. Funnier than Aniston up in a tree on DMT, which could have been handled better (though the hallucinations were amusing). Elsewhere, the film is enlivened by character actors like Joe Lo Truglio (he was the ""you guys on myspace?"" freak from Superbad and the guy with the weird voice from I Love You, Man) whose novelist character Wayne spends much more time running amok with his manhood exposed than he does writing his novel about ""The Monster of the Beltway"". Ultimately, Wanderlust flows in a typically deranged Wain manner with cars showing up in odd places, babies delivered at inopportune moments (and with gory results) and polygamy taking hold of the central plot. There is even some Stella-reminiscent action later on, once the tone of the film has been thrown headlong into madcap territory from which it emerges and drowns, emerges and drowns, dragging itself at last toward a smug, enjoyable finish.",1330560000,6,3288,5.178571428571429
4445628,1,B004QL7K6G,"Wanderlust is a lazy comedy about a New York couple George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) who find themselves unemployed and unable to pay for their too small-too expensive studio apartment -excuse me- microloft that they have just purchased. So they decide to abandon it and head south to Atlanta for a job that George's unbearable older brother Rick has set up for him. Along the way, they make a side stop at a kind of hippie bed and breakfast called Elysium. The commune is populated with all the stereotypical characters you see in comedies that poke fun of hippie culture. George takes a shine to it at first with its feel good, let it all go philosophy. Linda hates it of course. But they must have money so they proceed to Rick's house where poor George is subjected to Rick's lectures and overbearing nature because Rick is the success and George isn't. So they decide to head back to the commune where the tables turn and Linda starts loving the place and George hates it.
  Why? Because Linda has taken a shine to Elysium's alpha male Seth (Justin Theroux) and the prospect of free love with him. George is put off despite the promise of sex himself with the very attractive Eva (Malin Akerman). In a cringe inducing moment, George actually has to psyche himself up for it by talking dirty to himself in the mirror and then torpedoes the whole thing when he can't stop talking dirty to Eva turning her off. Of course why would any one need extra encouragement when it's Malin Akerman? Oh well.
  Then there's some artificial drama concerning a big corporation wanting to take over the land Elysium is on. That leads to your typical plot twist about who's helping them (hint: one of Elysium's members) but it's all handled like an afterthought.
  The problem with this flick is for one; the filmmakers chose an all too easy target (hippies) and instead of coming up with creative jokes they try to get laughs by showing how disgusting it's all supposed to be. For instance, when a couple who had recently given birth to their first child decide not to cut the imbilical cord and let it fall away naturally, they show up to the dinner table with the child and the cord still attached. Other jokes involve vegans and drinking concoctions made with roots and berries. There is one clever joke where Linda and Elysium's co-founder Carvin (Alan Alda) sneak off to a diner to eat ""real"" food including a plate full of sausages, steak and other meats.
  And course there are jokes involving nudity which leads to some full frontal discomfort mainly because the streakers are elderly or out of shape.
  Anyone who saw the red band trailer on YouTube (including me) will realize there are scenes missing from the final film. And the Mr. Skin crowd hoping to see Aniston topless will be dissappointed. So you may get the sense that the movie is a lot tamer than it could've been.
  Too bad too because Rudd and Aniston have real chemistry as a couple and are trapped in a script with trite jokes and no imagination at all.
  Bummer dude.",1330214400,6,3047,4.618518518518519
4445629,4,B004QL7K6G,"After missing ""The State"" when it was on the air, I became a fan of David Wain when ""Stella"" hit Comedy Central in 2005. From there I went back and visited Wet Hot American Summer and Role Models. Wet Hot American Summer is a classic while Role Models is humorous but just slightly better than average overall. Expectations were honestly pretty low for Wanderlust. The trailers were mostly just toilet humor (literally) and what appeared to be your everyday modern couple going to live with a group of hippies. How good could that be? It's probably because expectations were so low that Wanderlust is as great as it turned out to be.

George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) are moving to New York to follow their dreams. Well, George is reluctantly moving there while Linda follows her dreams. Now they find themselves with a studio apartment (oh excuse me, a ""micro-loft"") that is incredibly tiny and massively expensive. But things get rough when Linda's hopes get washed down the drain and George loses his job. George's brother Rick (Ken Marino) has a job waiting for George, but they're all the way in Atlanta. Leaving their dreams behind, George and Linda go on a road trip and stop at Elysium before reaching their destination. Elysium is unlike anything George and Linda have ever experienced before as everyone shares everything, is so open with one another, and even believes in free love. As everything that could go wrong does, George and Linda are faced with the decision of continuing to live in the city for the technology and advancements they love or moving to the country, being stripped of that technology, and feeling happier than they can ever remember.

One could argue that Wanderlust uses the same formula over and over involving raunchy jokes and dialogue and featuring the most nudity of any film in your recent memory. That may be the case, but if you're familiar with David Wain's humor then this should come as no surprise. You probably know what you're getting yourself into and you're either a fan of his work or you hate it (but then why would you be seeing this anyway?). Wanderlust is labeled as a comedy and if it makes you laugh, then it's done its job. If anything, this is actually a return to form for both Wain and the majority of the cast of ""The State.""

The film throws you headfirst into hilarity as the ""breaking the apartment in the old fashioned way"" scene is kind of a warm-up for what's to come. George's sarcasm is what will more than likely win you over the most while Linda's inability to commit to any sort of career causes her character to be pretty unpredictable. Elysium is a gold mine of eccentric characters; the most noteworthy being Wayne (Joe Lo Truglio) the nudist and Seth (Justin Theroux). Wayne's nude habits will either have you in tears from laughing so hard or cause you to turn away in disgust while Seth's outdated technology references, his ability to loiter around doorways out of sight and selfish tendencies are hilarious in their own right. Paul Rudd's mirror scene is what you'll remember the most though as you'll be laughing for a good two or three minutes straight from that scene alone.

Wanderlust does get pretty outlandish in its second half, but it isn't exactly the most grounded concept to begin with. There are several dream-like sequences that are fantastically surreal. The two that come to mind are Linda's peyote-like trip during the trust circle and George's fly dream. The fly dream is actually one of my favorite scenes in the movie since it's just so bizarre and random yet manages to fit the flow of the movie somehow.

The R-rated comedy does have its shortcomings though. Rick is easily the most annoying character to be featured in any film so far in 2012. You'll breathe a sigh of relief once his story arc is resolved. The other main one is the film's conclusion. It feels a bit generic when all of the raunchiness is dropped for heartfelt speeches and the struggle to do what's right. Everything still comes together in a logical sense, but it's in a way that seems so familiar which is kind of a letdown. The transition just doesn't feel as smooth as it should.

Wanderlust is vulgar, obscene, littered with jiggling unclothed man and lady parts, and downright disgusting at times, but it's laugh out loud funny because of all of these things. The story may be a bit lacking in parts, but your laughter will drown out whatever flaws the movie may have. While Wanderlust may not be for everyone, it certainly soars and caters to those who love this type of comedy.",1330041600,38,4575,4.705368289637953

4445657,5,B004QL7K6G,"Review of Wanderlust
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Wanderlust is one of the funniest comedies Ive ever seen. Ive probably seen it close to 50 times, and each time I laugh just as much.

A New York career couple suddenly lose their jobs, apartment, and lives as theyve known them. While driving south for a potential job opportunity, they stop at a bed and breakfast, Elysium. Elysium, as it turns out, is a commune full of an incredibly colorful and hilarious bunch of hippies!

This film, although on the surface is just a raunchy comedy, is incredibly realistic. Anyone who grew up in the 60s or 70s will point to characters on the screen and say, I know him! This is not a movie that makes fun of hippies. It depicts an accurate lifestyle at a commune. There are no doors in the house, natural foods and remedies are commonplace, and drugs are often used during bonding exercises. Yes, youll be laughing, but because its so realistic, not because its over-the-top offensive.

I love this movie, so obviously Im going to recommend it. Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd reunite to play the married couple, which is an adorable perk for those who loved their pairing in The Object of my Affection. And Justin Theroux plays one of the men of the commune; you can see the sparks flying when Aniston acts with her offscreen squeeze and now-husband!

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, there's one scene in this movie that will make you sick. When the group drinks payote tea, you might want to take a bathroom break. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity, drug use, and some sexual humor, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1497225600,,1748,4.604501607717042

4446071,5,B004QL7K6G,"Wanderlust  is a sharply comedic view of dedicated belief systems towards very different daily realities such as New Yorks small, stressful living in contrast to open communes or suburban isolation using consumerism to fill the void.
Having once shared life in a clean living macrobiotic farm community, I have personally experienced many of the scenes shown at Elysium such as natural lotus squat birthing, open group meetings with hurtful words, sneaking off to eat animal foods or sugar, and chanting in times of crisis. Hilarious portrayal of this life style and not so far off base. Really. Placentas were kept in our kitchen to be cooked or planted.
Loved the communes leader ( I have known the type), earthy granola ladies, ( admired many of them ) and Key and Peele. Hilarious statements throughout.
The Benjamins What we all do for them.
Wish there were more Elysiums, but without the portrayed drugs, vulgarity and open sex. The one I loved so many years ago had none of that. Nothing better than daily group meals and shared living tasks. It was a utopia.

It stars many major actors and is simply hilarious. The blu-ray quality is great, as you'd expect. I do not recommend this for children as there is male and female nudity.

A plot summary is: ""After George is downsized from his financial firm and Linda's depressing documentary is cancelled, they can no longer afford their overpriced 'micro-loft' in New York. They find themselves with just one option - to pack up their lives and head south to move in with George's brother and his wife. George and Linda stumble upon Elysium, an idyllic community where the only rule is to be yourself."" (Universal Pictures, IMDB)

There's a beautiful story that wanted to be told, but the director washed it out with intellectually insulting nonsense- Rudd's character wouldn't have said those things in the bathroom mirror, it wasn't funny- just multiple levels of awful. That's what the editing floor is for. I hope someone else will pick up the pieces of this bomb & make a real Romantic comedy.

4446625,4,B004QL7K6G,"I absolutely adored Wanderlust for the same reason I can't get enough of The State, Stella and Wet Hot American Summer.

The humor inherent to these Wainiac projects is one of moments and realities as opposed to sordid jokes, how uncomfortable the filmmakers can make the audience feel or irritating scatology (although there are a few moments in here, too).

What I enjoyed best about Wanderlust, however, was the nature of the relationship between the two main characters. The first third of the film had me really reflecting back on my last relationship and I loved that Wain brought in so many realistic qualities of living in the modern world (particularly the sense of harried NYC versus hippie-dippie Elysium). He really nailed certain specifics that made me both laugh AND feel that he was talking directly to me with this film.

Sure, there are parts of the script and film that miss here or there, and -- as per usual with Wain productions -- some of the actors go a little overboard at times ... but, ultimately, it's a hilarious film that stays fresh and funny throughout, with some true emotion and moments of sincerity that I think are missing from most mainstream films today, especially those claiming to be comedies for the lumpen set.

As such, it was equally refreshing that in an era where most such films -- funnily enough, usually stamped with the Apatow seal as this one is -- are about irritatingly annoying jerks who hate each other and who make you hate them even more (with the result of American Idol-watching, McDonald's eating troglodytes seem to not be able to get enough of such pablum), Wanderlust has characters who are actually endearing and who you want to see succeed; you're with them because they're ultimately good people and not just because they're played by du jour stars who you want to win despite how awful and superficial their characters may seem.

Give it a shot; you'll definitely be able to tell within a few minutes whether this movie is for you or not.",1388880000,,2005,4.75

I really enjoyed this film. I connected to it even though it was a comedy, on the level of trying to figure out how to do what you love, not be broke, and still be happy without selling your soul or life to be a slave to something you hate. It made me laugh, and it kept my attention.

There is nudity and it does have some crude moments, so naturally if you are not inclined to find that funny - this may not be for you. But overall, I think I would watch this again.",1386892800,,693,3.9784172661870505

Anyone who disliked this movie is probably because there are several shots of exposed human male genitalia, which many people find uncomfortable....but when it is used for comedic purposes, I find it pretty funny.

To keep things short, I'll say is that I found this movie to be different from the status quo in many ways...it still follows the hollywood plot formula, but there are many unexpected lines and moments to keep you laughing.

I say it's a must see for the twisted mind and a definite no go for kids, or even for teenagers, as they wouldn't understand much of the humor.",1383177600,,642,4.663716814159292

If you're over 30 then you should definitely be able to relate to this film in more than one way.  Sometimes we all wish we could escape from the hampster wheel of life.

4446685,5,B004QL7K6G,"Why wasn't this movie advertised?  It is HILLARIOUS!!!

I picked this film up on a whim, never having heard of it before.  However, it has 2 big names in it:  Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd, so I figured, how bad can it be?  Well, it wasn't bad at all.  It was FANTASTIC!

In the movie (which is funny right from the start, by the way) Jennifer Anniston (Linda) and Paul Rudd (George) are a married urban couple living in a ""micro-loft"" in New York.  But when George loses his job and Linda's ultra-serious documentary about penguins is rejected by HBO, they decide to high-tail it out of NY and go live with George's wife and brother down south, until they figure out what they should do.

It's a long drive to the brother's house, so George and Linda decide to stop along the way at a bed and breakfast called Elysium.  Only, SURPRISE!! This is no ordinary bed and breakfast.....it's really a modern day hippie commune!  (One clue that this is not your typical ""B & B"" is the totally naked guy they meet on the pathway to the hotel).

Due to recent hardships in their lives, the experimental community - despite it's lack of privacy and philosophy of ""what's yours is mine"" - has appeal to George and Linda.  Soon they find themselves embracing the bohemian life style - well, Linda a bit more than George, since she suddenly has a crush on the very charismatic guru guy named Seth.

Their marriage is challenged...temptations arise....and many quirky kooky characters are met (including Alan Alda, who is the patriarch of this weird hippie hotel).  Most importantly, there are plenty of laughs along the way....which never stop!  You know how some movies start out really funny, then they kind of ""lose it?""  Well, this movie retains the same high level of humor throughout.  I was never bored....I never felt like the movie ""dragged.""

Bottom line?  I laughed.  Out loud!  Would this movie win any awards?  Probably not, but so what.  I was entertained.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who just enjoys silly comedies about adults (not teenagers), such as Zoolander or 40 Year Old Virgin.  WARNING:  As you probably figured out by the cover (and the R rating) this movie is NOT for young children!  Watch after the kids are in bed, so they won't come into the room and ""see"" things you need to explain!  There is some full frontal nudity.....but the movie is never trashy.  Just funny!  Watch it!  You'll laugh, I promise you that!  I also recommend buying this movie, since you'll probably want to watch it again.",1378252800,2,2525,4.64027149321267

4446687,5,B004QL7K6G,"Some people might find things vulgar in this movie because there is some nudity, but it is very funny.  Its about two New Yorkers (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) who are broke and can no longer afford their ""micro-loft"" so they have to move in with Paul Rudd's brother.  Along the way they find a hippy compound/bed and breakfast where they stay the night, this is where the fun begins!  Hilarious movie",1378080000,,404,4.583333333333333

The only part of the movie that I dislike with a passion in the scene where Rudd is rehearsing his sex line in the mirror...L A M E!!!  They could have left that one out.  Otherwise good movie.",1377475200,,384,4.191780821917808
4446690,4,B004QL7K6G,"OK, I'm going to give this 4 stars because my wife and I both liked it - but we're glad we didn't pay full theater price. Paul Rudd and Jenifer Aniston are solid performers almost all the time, and they didn't disappoint here. Their chemistry might have been a little better, and I think it would have been interesting had Rudd been cast as the more ""let it all hang out"" type with Aniston as the uptight one, but no real complaints. The other characters were funny if one-dimensional - but we weren't really expecting deep, soulful insights with a movie like this. Rudd's brother was hilariously repulsive. The only thing that was a little annoying to us was the neat, wrap-it-all-up-in-a-nice-knot, Hollywood ending, with the obligatory meanies.

This was one of those Hollywood movies that got us thinking how, with a few tweaks and a commitment to true artistry, they could have actually ended up with something that would have something serious and lasting to impart - rather than an amusing, forgettable trifle. Imagine a version where (SPOILER ALERTS): (1) Aniston and Rudd don't get back together, and the tensions between their love and history and their desires for enriching life experiences are more seriously explored; (2) The commune's breaks with modern-day culture aren't quite so hollow and comedic; (3) The leader of the commune isn't such a one-dimensional villain but instead is a real person trying to make the best of an impossible situation; (4) The theme of how a commune can be so liberating in some ways, yet so stultifying in others, is more deeply explored.

But I'm going to give it four stars because this never pretended to be that type of movie.

PS: The title makes no sense, really. They weren't lustfully wandering. They were just two yuppies who, through a confluence of circumstances, ended up in a commune for a while.",1376006400,,1856,4.848580441640379

Cast: (5 stars) The best part about Wanderlust is the amazing cast. Every single character is unique, amazing, funny, and they all blend wonderfully as well. Justin Theroux is one of the best actors in the film, portraying the hippy group leader Seth. The rest of the cast is incredible as well, including Alan Alda!

Re-watch-ability: (4.5 stars) I liked this movie so much, I ended up watching it like 3-4 times, and it was actually still very good the 4th time. The movie is chocked full of so many great scenes and lines, that I can't stop watching. When one great scene ends, another begins!

4446837,3,B004QL7K6G,"Every trip starts with a first step, and ""Wanderlust"" takes a long stride at the beginning; the opening scene with Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston is pretty funny.  But sometimes, a long hike becomes, well, just a long hike, and it's better to just know when it's time to sit down and take a rest.  I knew that I was ready for one long before the film ended.

This film surely was influenced by comedies made by Ben Stiller, where humiliation -- and being able to withstand that humiliation, even as the viewer -- is important.  These films can be really funny, but they can more easily devolve into cringefests.  Now, ""Wanderlust"" never quite gets that bad, but it sure acts as if it tries.

Typical theme for this type of film:  are people who are involved in communes crazy, or is it more the case that people who engage in ""normal"" life really the crazy ones?  It deconstructs human behaviour to try to make that point, but it doesn't exactly work.  (It does have a lot of full male frontal nudity versus the standard female version in most ""dirty"" films, perhaps trying to help support that deconstruction.)  However, it still has it's moments, and I got a few good laughs out of it.

But even still, I wanted to go 4 here, but I just couldn't.  It was more like a 3 as it loses it's way, never to return, before the third act even begins.",1361404800,,1343,4.392712550607287

Now if it was Aniston and Jack Black, of Rudd and Cameron Diaz, then I might feel differently about it.

4447001,2,B004QL7K6G,"Linda (Jennifer Aniston) and George (Paul Rudd) have it all--great jobs, a wonderful marriage and a shiny new microloft in the heart of New York City in which to toast their success. Well, that is until George loses his job and Linda's documentary is passed up on by HBO. So now what's a hip, happening couple to do? Taken in by George's douchey brother, they struggle to find their place in the world. After a refreshing overnight stay at Elysium, the couple decides to make their home more permanently at the rural commune, only to find the free-spirited life isn't quite what it seems.

You know those movies where the trailer looks absolutely hilarious but then when you watch it you realize that all the funny parts were already in the trailer and you've essentially wasted your time? Yeeeeah. This is one of those movies. Don't get me wrong--I'm not saying Wanderlust wasn't funny, because it certainly did have its moments, but those parts are very far and very few between. Overall, for the type of movie it was, it was conventional and generic. Again, this is one of those times where high expectations led to severe disappointment. Wain and Rudd's previous collaborations (Wet Hot American Summer and Role Models) were total winners. I mean, the concept--taking a modern, hip couple and throwing them into a hippie-style commune--is comedy gold. So then where did it all go wrong?

Let's start with the casting. Aniston isn't someone you'd expect to see in a raunchy comedy and I suppose since her stint in Horrible Bosses, she's trying hard to break away from her rom-com typecasting. But I have to say, she just looked like a fish out of water. It just wasn't a role that suited her. Rudd, on the other hand, was right at home with his composed-man-meets-crazy-antics act. He practically invented and perfected the dry wit and sarcastic humour bit and he's about the movie's only saving grace because of it. I feel like everything else was just too forced or over the top to be funny. Wanderlust was a let-down and in no way lives up to Wain's previous credits. Yes, some of the characters are quirky but they grow to be too awkward and unbelievable for my liking. The plot was a mash-up of dull hippy clichs and it got old very quickly. I honestly had a better time watching the trailer than I did the feature-length film, which is saying something.

Food for Thought: Wanderlust is one of those movies that is doomed to lay in the ""failed-to-meet-expectations graveyard."" It's a conventional film that's raunchy for the sake of being raunchy and far from memorable, though it does generate a few laughs. I'd say, if you want to see it, it's worth a rental at best.

4447003,1,B004QL7K6G,"This movie was painful to watch. It actually wasn't so horrible until a little bit in. For once someone in a Jennifer Aniston movie was more annoying than her character. Paul Rudd was horrible. In one scene he's talking to himself in the mirror to pump himself up for sex and saying things like, ""I'm gonna get all up in that vag."" And then he repeats this and the like for what feels like forever in some of the dumbest voices I've ever heard. Not funny at all. I'm hard to offend but this was just BAD. It would be insanely uncomfortable to watch this with any older members of my family. God, it was uncomfortable just watching this alone. Would any woman sleep with this man?

Paul Rudd is CLASSIC in this movie and Jen Anniston...though not as great as HORRIBLE BOSSES...still puts in a good performance.  I purchased this movie only because I can't stop watching it!

4447026,3,B004QL7K6G,"There's one thing about Hollywood movies that never stops throwing me: cleverly conceived story ideas whose characters and twists carry at least a germ of plausibility are suddenly freighted, at the midpoint, with contrivances and stock situations that derail their charm and turn the movie back into a conventional plot-driven vehicle.

Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston are both as funny as we know they can be -- and the screenplay does a fine job of giving them a credible (and even hilarious) reason for ending up in the commune where most of the movie unfolds.  It was also quite witty to cast Alan Alda as the aging hippy who owns the place.  Eventually, though, the movie's plot twists get a bit hokey and the story of a New York couple forced by straitened circumstances to flee the city (and with it the materialist responsibilities of the rat race) to ""discover themselves"" becomes encumbered by stock situations and villainies.  Basically it runs out of gas.

Still, we downloaded it for $1.99 and at that price it was well worth it.  One last thing: there's some surprisingly dirty language and situations.  They didn't bother me or my wife, but if you were entertaining the idea of watching *Wanderlust* with your kids (I was personally grateful my 15-year-old daughter wasn't present) you might want to reconsider.",1348876800,,1326,4.9192825112107625

4447110,3,B004QL7K6G,"If you've seen the previews you know the gist of the movie: Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd are a married couple who end up in a commune named Elysium, that may or may not be a nudist colony.  In and of itself that was enough to reel me in.  Ultimately, however, I was a little disappointed.

As often happens in life, a couple - George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) - makes a mutual sacrifice by following the dreams of one and risking the lives of both.  George and Linda get in over their heads when her documentary pitch gets rejected and he gets fired, leaving them with no money to afford the recently purchased expensive, downtown NYC studio apartment.  Left with no choices, they pack up and move to Atlanta where George's brother Rick (Ken Marino) has a menial backup job.  On the way they search for a place to stay they end up at the aforementioned Elysium (I was hoping they'd find the motel from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vacancy/dp/B000RGN2JI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vacancy</a>).  At Elysium they encounter an assortment of offbeat, outcast, and oddball who live their free-spirited way.  The experience at Elysium, and the soul-crushing life possibilities at Rick's house, is enough for George and Linda to question their current situation, their preoccupation with technology and industry, and contemplate a life-altering decision.  Sadly, Wayne (Joe Lo Trugilo) is quickly revealed as the only nudist of the group is, immediately tempering the excitement and anticipation of a possible Anniston or Malin Akerman uncovering.

Speaking of Akerman, one of the strongest aspects of this movie is the combined cast.  Every bit player is someone who could carry a portion of a film in their own right.  Most are funny.  Alan Alda, Justin Theroux, Kathryn Hahn, Kerri Kenney, Lauren Ambrose, Michaela Watkins, and Todd Barry all bring something to the table.  Alan Alda, while up there in age, can still deliver in any role.

Being a fan of raunchy comedy, I really thought I'd like the film more.  The script is predictable as can be, but it's easily dismissed for people who can shut off their brain for two hours.  I'm also a fan of Paul Rudd; his sarcastic delivery is hilarious.  Unfortunately this film didn't deliver nearly enough laughs, and disappointed me just like Couples Retreat.  One scene has Paul Rudd in front of a mirror, preparing for a tryst with Malin Akerman, and he's obviously adlibbing for an extended period of time.  It's painfully unfunny to watch.

Your average moviegoer will likely not be entertained by the way this movie is structured and delivered, and it's not for no good reason: the movie has serious flaws when compared to well-crafted comedy classics. However, I am confused by the people who liked ""The State"" or ""Wet Hot American Summer"" but greatly disliked this movie...sure, it strangely danced a line of sincerity and absurdity, something that Wet Hot did not do and it was a greater success for it.  But like Role Models, if you take everything with a grain of salt and simply expect both absurdity and an attempt to honestly connect with the audience, theres a good deal of entertainment to be had here. I read terrible reviews and was disappointed when Wanderlust came out, but after seeing it, I think it's fine.  There is actually one scene that had my girlfriend crying laughing, causing multiple views (of the scene) until our rental timed out.  If you liked ""The State,"" I'm not quite sure what your problem with this movie is, unless you expected a full-length sketch movie.

The movie is great for film students wanting to learn how NOT to portray a romantic interest, because they made Theroux so foolish that I can't imagine how he'll receive future roles or be considered attractive.  Or maybe I'm wrong, Aniston seems to star in failure after failure and works steadily, so....

Very, very unfunny and just plain strange movie, its shocking that they released it at all.  And, though I was pleasantly surprised to see a few of the cast members from the ancient MTV comedy show The State (which I enjoyed, I think I was the only one), I know that movies which they star in are usually not so great, so I was immediately suspicious, and my suspicions were correct.

I have no idea if they--The State members, wrote the script, and I don't even care enough to find out, but I will tell you this; I truly could have gone without seeing one of The State members in full frontal nudity scenes, I'm not prudishly opposed to nudity, I just don't want to see him naked, thank you very much, its just too weird.

4447138,1,B004QL7K6G,"It's hard to know where to begin with this movie.  From a technical standpoint, the entire production has a home movie / reality TV feel.  As if the production used a single Best Buy videocam with just the built-in microphone, and was filmed in the diretor's back yard.  Music is added in an amateurish and perfunctory manner.

But the script is really what distinguishes Wanderlust ...and puts it into the 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' realm of badness.  There was not one funny scene  (not one; it was an ordeal to sit through) ... the movie waddled from one embarrassing situation to the next (I felt sorry for the actors, though Jennifer Aniston seems increasingly to be involved in such doomed projects).  Perhaps the scriptwriter and director are so in love with the 60's and the arrested development commune life depicted that scripted situations seemed funny (or maybe you need a toke to see the humor) but for the rest of us there was no irony ... the script is stupid, uncomfortable and just awful.

The DVD cover picture seems to suggest this is a comedy - but there is not one laugh in the entire movie (not one, I tell you, unless you think a hippy's impaired memory is a hoot ... in which case you would be better off with Cheech & Chong's or Harold & Kumar's classics).  I was truly convinced that there were no retakes in the film, and that most of the dialog was ad libbed.  But outtakes were shown during the credits (maybe these were the only retakes) indicating that the cast seemed to think that much of the script was funny - I guess there really is no accounting for taste, is there.

When the ordeal of watching Wanderlust ended for us (all 1 hour and 30 minutes of it) we were left wanting to see a real movie (or take a toke) just to get this out of our heads.  We downloaded 'Get the Gringo' with Mel Gibson.  Now there is a great script with the right actor, and super comedy ... but that's another story.",1345939200,,1929,4.415254237288136

Comedies are supposed to bring you up not slam you down face first like this one did for me.

You do (or at least I did) get attached to some of these characters and can relate to them.
However, the cheating/open relationship part really blew the movie up in my face.

They could have presented that scene any other way and it could have worked or even been funny but I just felt so gross watching that moment that I wanted to vomit.
Comedies are not supposed to make you do that....unless from laughing so hard, which I have before. (Not with this movie).

The only saving grace were the bloopers at the end reminding that I was just watching a movie, it was real and actually had me laughing. Too bad the rest of the movie did not.

I think this was supposed to be a comedy but I think it was anything but.
It was closer to a wild west movie or even a foreign film than it was to a comedy, that's how unfunny it was.

Well, I finally gave it a try, and it was actualy pretty entertaining. Now, let me say this- I have never done a movie review before, and I don't generally enjoy artsy ,introspective films, per se. Primarily, my favorite genres are thriller/mystery/suspense films. I find it difficult to go by people's reviews because everyone has different tastes. Product reviews are more cut and dry- it works or it doesn't, it has these features, etc.  A film is subjective. Usually, if it has 1 star and a bunch of reviews, you can assume it is something to pass up, but what about something like this, where it has a middle of the road rating, a mix of good and bad? I liked it, but there are some films I like that you might loathe,so I'll say this:

It was funny enough to keep my interest and make me chuckle here and there
There is some nudity, portrayed in a comical light, definitely some dirty language
It's certainly not a movie where I just had to know how it ended, I was just enjoying the quips.
If you like Paul Rudd, this has plenty of his style of sarcastic humor- love that
lots of funny characters, not just one or two

I just wanted to add a positive review, because I think there may be some people out there, like myself, who passed this up because of the rating and don't realize that it is actually a funny film worth renting. I'm not at all sorry I rented it, like I am in the case of a movie called ""9 June"" which also has a 3 * rating- that was something that I can't believe I sat through, just waiting and waiting for something to happen.

Bottom line: When will Hollywood figure out that even with dirty comedy, you still need to employ writers who can actually write.

4447219,2,B004QL7K6G,"""Wanderlust"" functions less as a film than it does as a series of comedy sketches stitched together. Starring two attractive and funny leads (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) and featuring even more likable and funny actors in supporting roles (Justin Theroux, Lauren Ambrose, Malin Akerman, Alan Alda, etc.); there is no shortage of talent here to mine. What's lacking is a consistent, cohesive storyline and believable character development.

Comedy Sketch 1: The film starts with couple George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) in New York, where their lives are falling apart. They've just spent a fortune on a tiny, overpriced studio apartment (or ""microloft"" as the real estate agent insists on calling it) when George loses his job, while Linda is unable to pitch her documentary (a labor of love about penguin testicular cancer) to HBO. This section of the film plays like a perfunctory parody of New York life, where hurried, exhausted people work in demanding, soul-crushing jobs just to be able to afford tiny apartments. This is territory that has been explored many, many times in much more clever films.

Comedy Sketch 2: Desperate, George and Linda pack up and move to Atlanta, where George can work for his brother. Driving through northern Georgia and looking for a place to spend the night, the couple happens upon the ""Elysium"" community, a hippie commune full of all sorts of wacky, countercultural characters. George and Linda have a blast spending the night partying with the welcoming and free-spirited people, before continuing onto Atlanta.

Comedy Sketch 3: George and Linda arrive at George's obnoxious, tactless brother's garish McMansion, in order to work for his Port-a-Potty business. The whole place reeks of misery, with George a rage-aholic, his wife heavily medicated, and his son an awful brat. So George and Linda quickly decide to go back to Comedy Sketch 2, to try living full time in Elysium.

The film might have worked if it had just completely abandoned any conventional storytelling and just embraced being completely absurd (like ""Wet Hot American Summer"", the classic that director David Wain wrote). Unfortunately, ""Wanderlust"" tries to convince the audience that its main characters have somehow learned something throughout all their wacky adventures, and emerged a stronger couple, and its in this way that the film falls flat. George and Linda seem to just flail about the film, going from one phony epiphany to another, before finally falling into a flat, contrived ""happy ending.""",1342396800,5,2525,5.196560196560196

others except Alan Alda (MASH). Twas great to see him again...got a little older as
time passes on.
So when i rented this movie, i already seen the preview, and there was something to
like...hippies...commune...drugs ...great mix for a movie.
  Usually when a movie has a RESTRICTED label, there is something worth restricting.. but in here we have a male walking around in the nude, and some not
very attractive females near the end......but open up your tv and people die with
bullets in their heads...and bodies get chopped up...but show a bit a flesh and
a few swear words....the whole world might come down....very sad state of society
indeed.

4447221,5,B004QL7K6G,"I read a lot of reviews before going ahead and deciding to rent this movie. I am a woman in my thirties who loves comedies, especially romantic comedies. And if you are someone who has kept up with recent movie trends in comedy, you know that nudity and vulgar humor is nothing new. If you have seen ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""American Reunion"" you have seen male nudity. Honestly, it's about time. We've been watching naked women for decades on television. It's about time some naked men were added to the mix.  Most of the reviews here have exaggerated the amount of nudity in this movie. Basically, just one guy is naked through the movie, with one scene at the end in which everyone is running and naked (and it's funny).

I won't get into details about the movie itself, but if you like today's idea of what a comedy is or a romantic comedy, like ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" you will enjoy this movie. I laughed many times. Paul Rudd is his usual hilarious self (and even funnier) and you get to see another side of Jennifer Aniston that she has yet to display in prior films. I really enjoyed this movie. I just got done watching it and am going to watch it again. Although, I felt the need to write this review for all the other people out there like myself, who are open-minded, down to earth, enjoy a good laugh and don't take offense to nudity. It's not one of those cheesy movies you watch and want to stop watching 5 minutes in. It's interesting and entertaining from beginning to end. I truly can't understand all of the bad reviews, unless the world consists of a lot of snobby, pretentious people? If you are a red-blooded, meat-eating (or vegan) American, you will love this movie! I hope that my review has done the job of helping others like myself decide whether or not they would like to rent this. If you want to be entertained and laugh, rent this movie now.

This isn't a bad film just decidedly average.  There are some laughs to be sure but not enough for me to recommend it.  The plot and setting of ""Wanderlust"" leave you with a sense of been-there-done-that.  This is kind of surprising because the director is David Wain who Rudd collaborated successfully in the past and produced by Judd Apatow.

Could delayed cord severing or waiting for the cord to fall off on its on time (2 - 5 days) help the child to feel more connected/grounded in life?  Navel-gazing on the navel.  I think this movie deserves credit for giving viewers a rare look at how natural child birthing is done where the cord is allowed to drop off on its own accord (""A Lotus Birth"").  I found the ""truth circle"" scene where one of the newcomers was being given constant advice on how to speak from one's heart hilarious.  But I can see why many reviewers didn't like this movie.  It was a bit rushed and it portrayed many of the indulgent aspects of boomers/hippies living in communes (intentional communities) where at one point the owner of the facility admitted that he had missed out on a lot of life by remaining in his cocoon.

The film is rated ""R"", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult to see it in theaters or to purchase it in the store. If you don't want to watch a hilarious movie with shocking obscenity and nudity, go watch something else.

I personally think ""Wanderlust"" is the perfect film for anyone who's questioned their life's path and I think the movie has some wonderfully understated moral themes about individuality versus group identity.

Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux and Paul Rudd are all at their best while they're working together. It's also fun to see three giant movie stars doing a film that was not a sure-fire blockbuster guarantee.

I say, if you're not a prude, see this film; If you are, go see another crappy remake of a fairy-tale or a movie about harmless vampires falling in love.",1341014400,78,984,4.605714285714286

But the last half of the movie just dragged with a predictable and repetitive storyline. Another example of writers not having enough creative range to fill out and then finish their script.

Movies about a return to hippie, commune, peace & love living emerge from either LA or NY writers about every five years so we were due for this rendition. This one had mostly an east coast vibe largely because of the quirky ""dumb blonde"" hook filled as usual by Aniston although, admittedly, she performed the role quite well. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not. Subplot and foil to the quirky blonde was the usual income & status driven male love interest as counterpoint to her now stereotypic quirk portrayals. The hIppies, of course, win the day against the evil developers & bankers, in showing that veggies rule over bank accounts and portfolios. Well, until push comes to shove.

Restricted Rating Warning:
It's surprising how rarely full nudity is found in film given it's inherently curious we are about the subject. Must be effective lobbying from Christian/Islamic/Hebrew doctrine keepers to hide such evil from the public. Church knows best, and their resources/influences run deep.

4447267,2,B004QL7K6G,"A man  is shown in full-frontal nudity repeatedly in the movie (the man holding up a glass in the picture above).

Near the end of the movie, a bunch of old men are also shown in full-frontal.

However, there is little female nudity in the movie.

There is a scene in which the Jennifer Aniston character and a bunch of other women take off their tops at a protest to get the attention of TV news cameras.  The audience only sees a blurred-view.  More female nudity would have made the movie more entertaining.  Especially that scene.

Some of the humor is contrived.  The writers seem to think going on-and-on with a joke makes it funnier, but it doesn't.  When the Paul Rudd character has a chance to sleep with a good-looking woman with the permission of his wife (wife played by Jennifer Aniston) he is so nervous that he keeps saying strange things until the woman changes her mind.  It's unclear why the Paul Rudd character, who is level-headed most of the time, and has experience sleeping with a good-looking woman (his wife), would get so nervous that he says strange things.

There is another joke which goes on-and-on in which male TV new-reporters harrass a female reporter while on-the-air.  This also gets less funny and less believable as it proceeds.

The hippie characters are repeatedly referred to as vegan, but the Jennifer Aniston character is taught by them to milk a goat at the start of the movie.  Vegans don't drink milk.  This discrepancy isn't explained.  Nor are we told much about the food eaten at the commune.  A message of the movie is eat meat instead of unspecified vegan food.

Near the end of the movie, one of the hippies physically assaults the Paul Rudd character, and the other hippies just stand by.

4447269,5,B004QL7K6G,"I am a 30-something person who enjoys and has had much contact, and even temporarily lived with the kind of free-living people featured in the movie, and I think this homage is pure genius!  I usually don't think much of the two main actors at all (Rudd or Aniston), but they were good in this movie.  The hippie ensemble is absolutely perfect.  Just loved this movie and if you have a love for these counter-culture types, you will probably find it to be harmless fun; a good-humored poke at hippies.  The film takes every cliche about hippies ever and squeezes them into the commune characters, but it's ok because it's self-aware that's it's just a movie; it's actually not trying to be offensive to ""hippies"" but in an odd way it celebrates them in a loving way! My boyfriend agrees, we both know people like the ones on the commune and believe the film presents them as sincere idealists.

Overall, the whole movie is light, fun, is full of memorable moments and characters, has some lowbrow humor scenes (but not as overt as other movies), and has a more unique storyline than the average comedy. Like the two main characters, I appreciate that counter culture, but can't live in it full time. Usually I can't abide ""raunchy"" movies, but this one is actually sweet.  The lowbrow humor is more about the incredible openness of the people versus the overwhelming private-ness of the outsiders, which is a very funny juxtaposition!

The movie is optimistic, wacky, and perhaps a bit too graphic (nudity, etc., but mostly in a non-sexual way). Are you offended by briefly watching old nudists (in a non-sexual scene)? Really? Haven't you ever seen male genitalia before? The nudity would be essential to telling the story of such a community (of which there are hundreds across America), so I don't believe it to be gratuitous in this case. These people really exist out there; I've met people like pretty much all the characters or bits of them and THEY have zero shame or weirdness about being naked (but of course, WE feel weird about it, hence the comedy).  It's just how they are, so it's all plausible.

Some interesting flaws of the unexamined, materialistic life are pointed out throughout the film, such as how the brother basically deals with excrement to buy fancy things, like a big house--a metaphor for how the main character (and we) all live working ""shoveling poop"" or working at a hateful job just to buy ""stuff"" that makes us miserable anyway; so it's not 100% fluff--there is a message behind the laughs.  I thought the movie got funny and wackier as it progressed, with a ridiculous ending to an incredulous story. Why does anyone want a realistic ending to a silly movie?  Perhaps people are too uptight with their expectations.  I especially liked how the Aniston and Rudd characters change because of their experience on the farm.  I would definitely recommend watching this if you are in a playful and open mood.

I would definitely caution prudish, mainstream, or materialistic types from watching this movie--it's not for the uptight! I also don't think this movie is actually as ""raunchy"" as viewers might expect it to be.  I typically can't stand Rudd or Aniston, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it!",1340409600,7,3223,4.792418772563177

eclectic group of people. They find more then the expected there. This
is a very funny movie but it is not for everyone. This is the type of
comedy where if you offend easy I would avoid it. Like most movies by
Apatow or Rudd the dialog is so great that you find it hard not to
laugh at the lines or the delivery of them. The cast is great in this
and everyone adds their own brand of comedy but at the same time no one
really gets in the way of the others. Just as a heads up though there
is a lot of full frontal male nudity in this, but its really funny when
it happens. I laughed threw the entire movie and there are a ton of
quotable lines in this, but this is not a movie I would buy. Overall, a
very funny movie that fans of Apatow will love. I give it a B+.",1339804800,,1259,4.080645161290323

What more could you want from the ""Wet Hot American Summer"" creator? We loved it! The only thing I thought, was when Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and Wain himself have little cameos ... I missed Stella and wanted the three to be a bigger part of the film! Hopefully there will be future Wain projects that include them more thoroughly. I will not spoil any plot points here, but needless to say, I watch a lot of the films that come out each year and was quite happy with this one, one of the best of the year!",1339545600,5,672,4.2578125

Unable to live with him, they opt to go live in a hippy commune. As it turns out the members are not as likable as George originally thought and one has designs on his wife.

I kept waiting for the film to become funny and break out of its predictable mold. It never did. Perhaps the funniest thing was Aniston ranting about Penguins being killed by global warming and living with the seals and polar bears in the Arctic. I didn't know if it was intended to show Aniston's character was stupid or the writer of the script was stupid. Penguins don't live in the Arctic. And since no one at HBO caught the goof while watching her film, I bet it was a stupid mistake made by writers who are not smarter than a fifth grader.

I was bored for most of the film.

Throw in more than a few seasoned comedic actors (Paul Rudd, Alan Alda, Justin Theroux, and many of the same actors and actresses from the aforementioned comedy group) and the star power of Jennifer Aniston. You'd expect the end result to be an above-average comedy, if not downright hilarious.

Don't get me wrong. Wanderlust isn't a bad film, but it doesn't really try very hard to be great. This might have something to do with the story, which is built so firmly on a tired cliche that none of the surrounding jokes can rise too high above it. The plot concerns George and Linda, two New Yorkers that have found themselves on the verge of bankruptcy and failure. In an attempt to avoid total destitution, the couple moves to Georgia to stay with George's horribly obnoxious brother, Rick (played by the writer of the movie, Ken Marino). Along the way, they detour to a very special bed-and-breakfast that turns out to be a hippie commune called Elysium. Cue: nudity, drugs, free love, and the loss of privacy and personal property.

There are few directions to take this plot in that haven't been done before, and Wanderlust gives each of them a bit of play. Some people in the commune turn out to be not as wholesomely granola as they appear. George and Linda's addiction to work and money doesn't turn out to be so vile and absurd. Drugs and free love may or may not offer quite the utopia that they seem to. And, of course, real estate developers are all underhanded slime bags who only care about building casinos. In Georgia.

Ha ha ha ha! Oh, silly movie. Commercial gambling isn't legal in Georgia! (You can hop on a casino boat in Savannah, but gambling isn't allowed until you're in international waters.) Ah, but who cares?

I do. This is evidence of laziness. The evil real-estate developers did not have to be building a casino. It could have easily been any other symbol of American soullessness, such as a strip mall, or series of resorts, or something else not nearly so cliched and overused. The point being, instead of trying to be creative or clever, Marino went with the first immediately available stereotype and shoved it into the script, regardless of if it made sense or not. The same goes for most of the jokes about hippies and even suburban life (Rick's mortally depressed housewife is over-medicated and in hilarious (?) denial; hippies hilariously (?) try to have conversations with George while he's sitting on the toilet; the commune leader is so fried from years of LSD that he is an hilarious (?) chore to talk to). As the comedian once said, ""That joke's so old it can vote.""

That's not to say it isn't done well. The actors nail nearly every scene, even if the lines seem pre-chewed. And there are a handful of refreshingly new additions to the line up, including a bit about a car in a lake, a nudist novelist, and a real estate agent who is unusually forthright about her personal life. But these are exceptions rather than the rule. The script is further muddied by Linda and George's constant flip-flopping on the whole hippie idea. Obviously, for the plot to work, one of them must love it and the other hate it, but those roles reverse mid-way through the movie, and for no immediately obvious reason other than that it must. The end result is that you can't tell who's being a stick-in-the-mud nor who is being blind to the less endurable realities of the whole hippie mindset. The movie doesn't really know how it feels about either side of the coin, and so it adopts a noncommittal attitude that makes the whole story feel ambivalent and overly-fake. It becomes less about a story, and more about an excuse to continue making jokes about finding the worst kind of hair in your homemade wine or people bringing placentas to breakfast.

I laughed a decent amount, but I was bummed by the shrink-wrapped, assembly-line feel to the movie. With this much comedic talent working on a project, you'd expect, if nothing else, a little ingenuity (which is only briefly found in a few quick news segments) or risk. Instead, you have two people risking their entire livelihood in a story that, itself, takes no risks at all.",1339372800,2,4970,5.3572343149807935

4447291,2,B004QL7K6G,"The setup of Wonderlust will be familiar for any couple who's lived in Manhattan, battling to pay a mortgage for a closet-sized apartment and then wondering what happens if one or the other loses their jobs. Naturally, this happens here so the couple lose their apartment and then embark on a spiritual journey to find their purpose in life outside the Big Apple.

The first 30 minutes are the funniest part of the film, with Ken Marino playing the over-the-top successful brother and Michaela Watkins hilarious as his drunk, unhappy wife. Unfortunately, this section is dispatched quickly and we're rapidly dumped at the beginning of the unfunny part of the film - arriving at the commune.

Think of every hippie cliche you can in 60 seconds and turn them into a series of SNL sketches - this is what the rest of the movie comprises. We have sharing bathrooms, sharing wives, nudists, talking to trees into the forest, hallucinogenic drugs, drums circles - you name it, it's been shoe-horned into one sketch after the other.

In the midst of this, the comedy quotient drops continuously and there's an uneasy feeling half-way through that the plot has officially left the rails. Every joke feels overly set up and forced and it relies enormously on Paul Rudd's reaction to the whole thing. There's notably a truly weird scene featuring redneck dirty talk that feels strangely out of place. Towards the end, the ever-important happy ending is hastily thrown together to reset everybody back to a state where they were better for the experience.

Wanderlust is neither funny nor dramatic. It's like somebody neutered The Beach and replaced the dramatic intensity with half-baked SNL jokes. It's s shame that with the strength of the cast there wasn't any material hiding in the script to play off.",1336608000,5,1796,4.917491749174918
