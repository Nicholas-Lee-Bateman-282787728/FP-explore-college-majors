1909371,4,B0000AX2R5,"When we see Hogan and Snead actually playing golf, this is a great video. Unfortunately, maybe 1/3 of it is taken up with documentary material about the Houston area, where the golf course is, and the entire match is not even shown! The Hogan shots are a must-have, however, and a 2 minute bonus of Ben demonstrating his swing is almost worth the price of admission.",1247356800,,366,4.5606060606060606
1909372,5,B0000AX2R5,"The only time that Snead and Hogan ever played a head to head 18 hole exhibition match for national television took place at the Houston Country Club in 1965. Prior to this, Snead had held a 3-0 series edge in tour playoffs, including the famous win at the 1954 Masters. Hogan played his guts out at Houston, hitting 18 fairways and 18 greens. Career grand slam winner  Gene Sarazen called Ben's round the best from tee to green that he'd seen in his 63 years. Officially, it ended 69-72, misleading since Hogan missed many holeable putts, the bane of the ageing golfer. Do not be too quick to turn off your video either. Two men who combined to win 16 major titles had more understandable technique tips after the match than one will hear from a modern pro in hours of lessons.",1200355200,,778,4.47887323943662
1909373,5,B0000AX2R5,If you are a big Hogan fan this is definitely worth getting.  There are not many places where you can actually see Ben hitting shots and playing golf other than this.  Ben hits all 14 fairways and 18 greens during this match and with a little better putting could have shot a really low score.  Much is made about Ben playing a fade but on the first hole been hits a draw driver and a draw iron into the green.  He basically played whatever the hole called for.  This is a real classic match and a must see for Ben Hogan or Sam Snead fans.,1168992000,,539,4.095238095238095
1909374,4,B0000AX2R5,"This video not only brings back the memory of two of the worlds greatest golfers of all time, but reminds me of the consistancy and longevity of these two titans. Before there was Palmer, Nicklaus, or Earl Wood had a gleam in his eye, these two prowled the circut along with Lord Byron and dominated the sport for almost two decades. When this video was shot, Hogan was basically putting the finishing touches on his career, yet would still particpate in majors and some charity events till the end of the 60's. Snead however would continue to play the circut, and would be instrumental in developing the Seniors circut we see today. This video is well worth the price just to see the two go at it for 18, (Hogan never played a match just for fun) and while Houston CC is a fairly wide open venue, it still is a competitive course. By the way Hogan hits all 18 in regulation. The video is a little goofy at the beginning talking about the evolution of Houston and its future but all in all a fun trip for those of us who remember the two or any younger folks who truly want to see two of the most contrasting yet finest swings ever.",1163030400,4,1132,4.31924882629108
1909375,1,B0000AX2R5,My VHS tape sound was terrible.  It sounded like a motorboat on the sound track.  The sound is so annoying it has to be turned off to view the tape.  The visual aspect was fine.  I am very disappointed in the quality of the product.,1156464000,,232,4.088888888888889
1909376,5,B0000AX2R5,"The PGA Tour Presents - SHELL'S Wonderful World of Golf: Classic Golf Matches from Around the World.  Hogan vs. Snead.  Houston Country Club - Houston, Texas.  Aired February 21,1965

A classic match with a bonus... tips from Hogan and Snead!

Considered by many to be the best golfer of all time, Ben Hogan is probably best remembered for his diligent work ethic and search for perfection.  Driven by the desire to win, Hogan's first tour victory came in 1940.  From 1946-48 he won 32 times, including three major titles.  A near-fatal car crash in 1949 almost ended his career, but Hogan's determination never faltered as he mounted a spectacular comeback in the 50's, winning six more championships.

To his first tour win in 1937 Sam Snead added more than 100 additional worldwide victories over the next four decades.  A founding member of the Senior Tour, Sam continued winning even into the 1980's.  His record is only part of what makes him legendary.  With one of the most admired and natural golf swings the game has ever seen and an easy-going attitude to match, Sam Snead is undoubtedly one of golf's greatest players.

Houston Country Club's generous fairways are forgiving off the tee, but to shoot low, precise iron shots to the giant elevated greens are a must.  This was an ideal venue for the historical 18-hole match between two masters of the game, Ben Hogan and Sam Snead.  Hogan proved this by hitting every fairway and every green in regulation.",1145404800,5,1468,4.816

7997881,5,B0000AX2R5,"The earliest of the Wonderful World of Golf series but probably one of the best. You get to see Bryon Nelson play and he still had a lot of game.

HHogan's technique in this video is flawless; 18 GIRs and hit every tairway in this round. He beat Sam Snead by three shots, it could have easily been six shots.",1254700800,,314,4.526315789473684
