8674773,5,B00MUUPAZI,Best version I've seen.  The two principals are fantastic.,1509667200,,58,5.444444444444445
8674774,2,B00MUUPAZI,"I am a great fan of Rudolph Nureyev but this seemed more like he only did a bit of tweaking a few things and someone else did the rest of the choreography. We didn't like much about how kids acted or treated others. Often they were bad so of course the adults had to fix. The Fritz character was not as despicable as in many others, but we really missed seeing students as the young Clara and Fritz. I kind of agree with the other reviewer who suggests that this is more of a child's version even though it was done by the professional company of Vienna, Austria and has a great dancer to choreograph. I think it maybe that it was not a good match of styles with this ballet group and this choreographer. Also didn't like the costuming either. We did like the Drosselmeyer as he was kind and fun, but the soundtrack seemed off or the dancers were.",1449964800,,847,4.267080745341615
8674775,2,B00MUUPAZI,"What I probably object to most in the many productions of Nureyev's ""Nutcracker"" is his fussy and needlessly complicated choreography, especially for the corps de ballet. The grand pas de deux in the Covent Garden version is just plain scary for the poor ballerina, Merle Park. She might as well be dancing alone since she and Nureyev do almost the same steps. Nureyev was a great dancer, revolutionizing the status of the male dancer on the stage, but as a choreographer I really don't think he really understood the connection between the idea of the music and the steps the dancers would do to express that music. I have noticed this in his productions of a number of the 3-act classic ballets he has ""reformed.""",1420156800,,715,4.728
8674776,1,B00MUUPAZI,This is more like a kids show and not a real ballet.  Both of my daughters were taking ballet classes and this specific version of the Nutcracker reminded me of their shows.  There are many different Nutcracker versions and this one is definitely one of the worst.  I would not recommend it to anyone,1419897600,5,300,4.518518518518518
8674777,5,B00MUUPAZI,"Nureyev was one of the greatest at staging the great classical ballets. He was tireless at presenting the story in the clearest possible way as well as digging into what the story really should be. He also corrected artistic imbalances, such as making the male dancing more equal to the female dancing. He even developed the ballet costume that male ballet dancers wear that has become the world standard. Nureyev also understood very well that in ballet, dancing should be the primary presenter of the story and that is why he infused these ballets with plenty of great dancing. Unlike ballet producers of the past, he had the talent pool to achieve this. Balletomanes often find this baffling, wondering how anyone could improve what are classics. After all, nobody could tell Rembrandt how to paint better, could they? The problem is with the concept of ""classical"". The term as applied to ballet is not the same as art and music. Even the pointe shoe was not really perfected(if you could call it that) until the mid-twentieth century. Anna Pavlova was the first to use a pointe shoe approximating the modern version, but it still fell way short. Rembrandt never had a problem finding good brushes! Ballet is a complex art involving many artistic talents to put a production on stage. Only in recent times has it begun to all come together.
Nureyev's version of The Nutcracker is beautifully staged in this production. The dancing is uniformly inspired and magnificent by the entire cast. Both Liudmila Konovalova and Vladimir Shishov dance with great passion and accuracy. They both seem to really enjoy this ballet!
In some versions, there are mice, and in some there are no mice(Patrice Bart's version has no mice). In this there are mice. Some versions use children, and some do not. Here children are used but not in the main roles. The young Clara is played by the principal. Another interesting aspect in this version is that the magical ability of Drosselmeyer is underplayed. Other than presenting two large dancing dolls, he seems very normal. Unlike other versions, in this there is no evidence that Drosselmeyer is directing Clara's dream. She just has the dream apparently on her own. Also in this version, unlike others, everyone in Clara's dream is actually someone from her family(not just Drosselmeyer). Clara is basically feeling sad and unloved by her family. We even see family members taunting her about her affection for the nutcracker doll by tossing it around. This moment is also represented in her nightmare sequence, driving home the idea that she feels taunted and unloved. Only Uncle Drosselmeyer shows her some paternal affection. After all, he is the one who gave her the nutcracker doll. Keep in mind that it is Clara's dream, not Drosselmeyer's, so any attempt to imply some impropriety is misplaced. Keep in mind that in most(Balanchine's being an exception) Nutcracker versions, Clara's dream is a ""coming of age"" moment. It also gives her comfort and hope that she will experience acceptance and love in her life.
There have been plenty of Nutcracker productions and this is definitely among the finest on DVD.",1417564800,2,3150,4.96780303030303
8674778,3,B00MUUPAZI,The nutcracker has been done to death - I bought this one because it was based on Nureyev choreography but frankly there are better versions.,1415750400,,141,4.68
8674779,2,B00MUUPAZI,"I always look forward to seeing new performances of the Nutcracker - I always hope to find a production that breathes new life into the gorgeous music and fantastical, colorful storyline, but this performance, executed by The Wiener Staatsballett and the Orchster Der Wiener Staatsoper conducted by Paul Connelly, is only middling - with uninspired, sloppy dancing and indifferent production values.  The stage and costumes are drab and brown, while the dancing, a recreation of Rudolf Nureyev's classic choreography by Manuel Legris, lacks precision and commitment, everyone is hitting their marks, but there's a noticeable lack of joy, and mistakes are obvious and distracting.  And I was shocked when I saw that their ""nutcracker"" was a rag doll, instead of a proper wooden nutcracker!  A more brilliant color palette and better video editing would have served this Nutcracker far better.",1414195200,6,891,5.35
