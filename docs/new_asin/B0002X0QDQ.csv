8033909,5,B0002X0QDQ,I use this video in the elementary school setting to help students learn skills to prevent and protect themselves from bullying.  Good tips are given and the video encourages kids to deal with bullying without fighting.  This would be great for any child who may be experiencing being bullied.,1269907200,,293,4.959183673469388
