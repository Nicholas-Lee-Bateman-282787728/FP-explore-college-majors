5696663,5,B00C7QD8MC,I was pleased to get  this product about the Lone Ranger after seeing the new movie by the same name. Being an older gentleman I remember the Lone Ranger as the type person as played by Clayton Moore and John Hart. The new movie was different from what I remembered the Lone Ranger to be. This product make me go back to the type of western heros that we as kids grew up with and not the groofy things that so many of the heros of days gone by are now made to look like fools on tv and in the movies,1375488000,30,499,3.892156862745098
5696664,5,B00C7QD8MC,"I purchased this DVD package for my young grandsons. After seeing a preview of the current Lone Ranger movie, I decided that it was my ""responsibility"" to tell, better yet show, my grandsons the true REAL story of The Lone Ranger and his fight for law and order in the Old West. The DVD's have 14 episodes of the old original TV series, each lasting about 20 minutes, and ending with a ""cliffhanger"". I watched 2 episodes myself, to see what they were like, and forwarded it to my grandsons (8 and 11 years old). Wasn't sure how they would take to watching B&W TV, but, apparently it has been accepted pretty well. Just felt compelled to do something to counteract the ugly stupidity of the current movie version of the Lone Ranger. Tonto, with a raven on his head, how dumb is that?!!",1375315200,71,785,4.458333333333333

5696672,5,B00C7QD8MC,"Although I declined to give Disney any of my money at the theater for their recent ""version"" of the Lone Ranger, I did watch it as a Netflix rental.  My feelings of disgust at the abomination they made, fueled my search for the original heroes to show to my children.  This wonderful series fits the bill, and has become one of our favorite entertainments. Little moral plays, modern versions of Medieval mystery moral plays, they depict strong, brave men and women doing the right thing, opposing evil and living honorable lives.  So refreshing, after the sea of degeneracy we are awash in from the Industry now.  Highly recommended.",1456099200,,634,4.842592592592593

Watching him watch each episode was like seeing a 65 y/o grandpa of two become a 6 year old boy again.  Any fan of the original Lone Ranger series will enjoy this set.

5696738,2,B00C7QD8MC,"I had the feeling, in seeing the trailer, that this was not going to be in the spirit of the great original story -

  that turned out to be an understatement.  It appeared that they would go for gags and effects and narrow escapes, which they do, and which might not be so bad, but for the fact that they also lose the essential spirit and plot that the Lone Ranger story requires if it is going to bear the title.

  Casting Depp as Tonto was all right, and making him insightful and creative was good, but the film makers (I don't remember who they were, and haven't the inclination right now to look it up) want to make the central character an unappealing doofus in the bargain.  Nor is the story helped by its quirky beginning, showing Tonto as a live 1930s museum piece (an idea that could actually have been mined for something interesting, had the will been present) and telling an odd tale that is again out of accord with the defining original theme.  That was a sad and perverted effort, albeit to no surprise given the Hollywood mentality.  K",1395100800,,1055,4.419689119170984

It came off sounding like a cartoon and I for one was very unhappy. If you are going to do something, do it right or don't do it at all! I will NOT purchase from this company again.

5696754,3,B00C7QD8MC,"This is how your review will appear:

Precious memories...I got 'em, just like most of the men (and a few women) who review this set.

Like the Season 1-Season 2 75th Anniversary DVD set, this set is important, because it keeps this classic TV series--and all the other stuff, the radio program, the comics--in this corner of North American (yeah, Canada, too) popular culture alive and out there.

But my memories ARE precious, so after watching an episode and a half...I ditched it. See, I was only about ten when I saw this stuff. I'm not ten anymore. I've grown up. The TV show, of course, didn't ""grow up"" with me--or anyone else. And it is unfair to ask it to do the impossible. Sorry, folks, but it was almost impossible to produce really quality entertainment on the kind of crank-it-out treadmill much of filmed TV was in those days. However, having just sampled a bit, my memories are still intact.

Before we owned at TV (1953), the Masked Man was on the radio, and those are the most precious memories of all, because they really are my creation. Radio--and the Ranger's records--worked that way. There aren't a lot of those memories--in Vancouver, B.C., I don't recall a local radio station carrying the show, so I only heard it via Seattle--static and all. Usually when I was sick, curled up in bed, watching the glow from my little red mantle radio.

The new Johnny Depp movie? Great entertainment, clever stuff, fabulous visuals. I appreciated it, enjoyed it...and my memories are still intact!

Thanks to Mr. Hornaway in New Jersey: in his review of the 75th Anniversary set he takes the trouble to quote the introduction--a terrific, evocative piece of writing I have carried in my brain for over half a century. However, the review actually missed one line, which I have included below in caps. Jog your memory:

""A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty `Hi Yo Silver!' The Lone Ranger...(`Hi Yo Silver, away!') With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early west. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. FROM OUT OF THE PAST COME THE THUNDERING HOOFBEATS OF THE GREAT HORSE SILVER! The Lone Ranger rides again!""",1381363200,9,2271,4.7052896725440805
5696755,4,B00C7QD8MC,"After viewing the Lone Ranger movie this summer, I got this for my mother for her birthday and she and I got to see about 5 out of the included 17 episodes last night.  There were several times during that wherein the audio dropped out totally.  I am hopeful it isn't the DVD but it would be pretty forgivable under most circumstances.

However, this isn't most circumstances.  This DVD release, very unforgivably, has no subtitles.  Of course you COULD use closed captioning for the hearing impaired, as this DVD does thankfully have that, BUT subtitles, especially for those instances in which you can't figure out what is going on because the audio dropped out, are absolutely a vital thing.  Shame on you, whoever decided to put this DVD set out for real cheap and decided that cheaping out also meant stripping out the subtitles!  I shall have to go looking for other Lone Ranger things that involve Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels and see if the audio dropouts are more pronounced on this release than on other releases of the show.",1381017600,3,1040,4.712707182320442

5696761,5,B00C7QD8MC,"This 80th Anniversary collection of The Lone Ranger television episodes is excellent TV viewing.  The Ranger and Tonto has been with us on television since 1949 and was heard on the radio since 1934. These episodes are the creme of the crop. The production values, the scripts, the acting -- yes, they actually acted - has remained intact for all these years.  Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels were and will always be considered the Lone Ranger and his Indian companion, Tonto. Riding Silver and Scout, they battled bad men and fought for justice. The Ranger never killed. He wounded so they would stand trial.  Recently, Warner Brothers developed a new movie called The Lone Ranger.  Starring Armie Hammer as The Ranger and Johnny Depp as Tonto, this movie opened and closed in little over one month.  The true Lone Ranger has been an American icon in all media since the early 30's. No new movie can say that. Who was that Masked Man? Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. That's who.",1377302400,78,984,4.764705882352941
