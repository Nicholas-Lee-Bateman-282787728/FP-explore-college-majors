8497106,5,B006FNHSGU,"In a world of cookie cutter entertainment this film stands apart as the ""one and only"" real southern made zombie film.  It's an independent zombie masterpiece. It's funny in all the right places and it's not full of filler or other genera specific garbage. It's NOT, I repeat NOT - 8 people trapped in a - mall - underground dwelling - bar - gas station, or what ever.  In Broken Springs Shine of the Undead Zombies, these guys are running FOR THEIR LIFE!!!!!. This is a must see for all those zombie freaks out there, you won't see another one like it - ever.",1327968000,,560,4.375
8497107,4,B006FNHSGU,"Just when I thought there were no more cool zombie flicks, I stumble upon Broken Springs.

It's a fun zombie flick in the vein of ZombieLand. The killing of the zombies is both enjoyable and creative, especially given its low budget.

Broken Springs has a lot going for it. It never quite makes up its mind on whether it wants to be a parody, an action movie, or a conspiracy flick; which is great as the movies quick pace keeps you entertained the whole way through.

Definitely one of the best zombie flicks I've ever seen. Even the zombies were superb. The rest of the cast shines as well. I suspect this movie will launch some careers.

Broken Springs exceeded the expectations set by the trailer. So if you liked the trailer, you'll love the movie.",1327622400,,753,4.514705882352941

8497109,4,B006FNHSGU,"I had heard about this movie but, figured it was like most of the ""Sci-Fi Original"" movies that seem to be proliferating and reproducing at a terrible rate these days!  I was pleasantly surprised as a previous reviewer mentioned it was more like the classic Zombie films of the past!  No over the top special effects and everything blowing up all the time!  Just real characters in a real bad situation trying to get out alive!  The main characters are high-school students and they are joined by other characters who seem to have some inside knowledge of what's going on and try to help them.  I do hope there's a sequel!  I'm anxious to hear the back story of how things came to be and especially to find out who this mysterious ""Trucker"" character really is!!  (Watch it and you'll understand)  All in all, a really good movie that I enjoyed thoroughly!",1323475200,,856,4.5855263157894735
8497110,5,B006FNHSGU,"This is a must have for Zombie Collectors, Honey badgers even stand in awe while the gore drizzles like Jelly on a Tin Dog house Roof with Chain Lightnin painted on it. It's great to see movies like this produced straight from the heartland of America at it's best. I give it 5 pools of viral infected blood, a must see.",1323216000,4,320,4.262295081967213
8497111,5,B006FNHSGU,"This movie isn't Citizen Kane. It isn't even the Citizen Kane of zombie movies. But, ""Broken Springs: Shine of the Undead Zombie Bastards"" is a carnival ride from start to finish and a welcomed oasis for zombie movie fans lost in an endless wasteland of God-awful wannabe zombie epics. You know you're watching a good movie when you realize you've forgotten you're watching a movie because you've become absorbed in the story. That should happen to you while watching this film.

Zombie movie producers keep trying to one-up each other by placing zombie plagues in more and more outragious scenarios. Zombie stripper. Zombie Nazis. Zombies in love. But they've lost track of what attracted us to the genre in the first place. George Romero showed us what it would be like for normal, average people in Small Town USA to be placed in a zombie apocolypse. He showed different people reacting differently - heros, villians, cowards - and it was fascinating. ""The Walking Dead"" is doing the same thing with tremendous success. And that's what ""Broken Springs"" does. Three average high school boys and a town full of characters you'd meet in any small town USA. One minute they're living a normal life. Going to school. Playing Bingo. Working in a diner. Partying. The next minute they're being attacked by cannibal zombies and watching everyone they know being torn to shreds. What will they do to survive?

I think anyone who is a fan of ""Night of the Living Dead"", either of the ""Dawn of the Dead"" films(1978 or 2004), the first two ""Return of the Living Dead"" movies in the 1980s, or ""Shawn of the Dead"" will enjoy Broken Springs for its action, gore and humor. Based on those three criteria, Broken Springs is probably the Citizen Kane of micro-budget indy zombie movies. The DVD also has a ton of extras including deleted scenes, outtakes, post production, and a series of behind the scenes videos which are almost as un as the movie.",1323129600,,1935,4.790419161676646
8497112,5,B006FNHSGU,"Wow!  This movie is if anything...FUN!!!  The tenacity of teenagers, that youthful energy that keeps the world moving is on display here in a Zombie ridden world. Even with the prominent display of the undead, the story and characters bring a vibrant feeling to the viewer. As you root for the protagonists a wave of adrenaline carries you through every new development of this feature film. Who knew being attacked by Zombies could be so much fun!",1323129600,,448,4.805194805194805
8497113,4,B006FNHSGU,"In the world of The Walking Dead, it's nice to return to a simple, slapstick, low-budget, goofy, creative film.  This is all of those things.  It's hilarious, it plays on the most outrageous stereotypes of small-town Appalachia (in the most delicious of ways), and it's one of the first zombie movies in a long time to not take itself way too seriously.  It's a nice change and imminently enjoyable.",1323043200,,399,4.753623188405797
