8590697,5,B00007M4ID,"Volume #1 is only 35 minutes with examples of Fleischers earliest films, with a well done background on Fleischer.
The prints are superb (or at least the best we'll ever get), many are tinted. and come with the ""classic"" Winston Sharples Ko-Ko music (added for TV release in the 1950s).
DVD editions will be available next month.
My only request is: more of his wonderful Fleischer collection.
