8440159,5,B004SR7QYO,"This is a great DVD if you are new to paper clay - the instructions are detailed and clear. Being able to make and work with this clay will really expand the types of things I can do! I liked how the DVD showed several ways you could use the clay - with the artists demonstrating and explaining all the steps and techniques they were using as they went along. I'd say it was one of my better DVD purchases. Plus, there's some humor in it, so that's always fun!",1338076800,,460,4.122222222222222
