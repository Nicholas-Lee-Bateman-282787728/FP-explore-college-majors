8182159,5,B000NW5RMQ,"Years ago, I bought this product for my father who struggled with reading problems his entire life. I later donated the product to the local Boys and Girls Club.

I'm retired now - and one of my life dreams is to start/be part of a literacy program. Reading is so fundamental - and this program which teaches reading using a Phonetic system is great!

I wanted to replace the program I had given away. I was ecstatic when I saw several of them advertised on Amazon.com.

I received my order promptly. Thanks.",1276300800,,508,4.5
