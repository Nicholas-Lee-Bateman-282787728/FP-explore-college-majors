3774685,5,B001RE9HDY,good story line...the characters decisions are a little frustrating @ times from a lesbians perspective but not as predictable as all the other lesbian movies...,1255651200,,161,5.48
3774686,4,B001RE9HDY,"I can't think Straight was a refreshing take on the typical lesbian romance.  Note I said lesbian romance, not porno flick.  It's tasteful and romantic all at the same time, and the acting is beautiful.  The World Unseen is good as well, though the pace is a bit more relaxed.

I loved them both!  Definitely worth the money!",1254787200,,325,4.5344827586206895

3774688,4,B001RE9HDY,"I love both of these movies and have watched them numerous times. The story lines are great, especially the movie World Unseen. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the quality of the DVDs; it's very grainy and the picture quality is poor.",1251849600,2,242,4.651162790697675
3774689,5,B001RE9HDY,"""I can't think straight"" is such a cliche, yet worth watching over and over again. It's not going to be a serious watch, but more like a comedy with a typical storyline. Big plus for having Lisa Ray :D",1251417600,,201,4.17948717948718
3774690,5,B001RE9HDY,"First, let me say that I first became familiar with Shamim Sarif's work, while visiting the Philadelphia Gay Film Festival over the last few years. This will be long, as I ABSOLUTELY LOVE both films, and can't recommend them enough for some humor, realistic drama and a journey beyond any existing borders of the mind. As a connoisseur of hi-definition films, and a wide variety of domestic and world cinema,  these are 2 that absolutely NEED to be on Blu-Ray! The colors and visual depictions in both films pop right off the screen and are begging for this treatment!
My partner of 10 years and I have become life-long fans of Shamim's work, as this writer/director has captured our hearts and souls with relevant and poignant storylines that could serve as crossover projects for the mainstream media. I believe the latter is crucial in engaging America and the world in a dialogue of equality which transcends sexuality or gender.

***SPOILER ALERT***

THE WORLD UNSEEN:
=====================
For me, this film is a stunning, visual masterpiece, based on the book of the same name. The sweeping visual landscape, and texture and layers of the setting, costumes, characters and lifestyle are simply magnificent and breathtaking. The film also masterfully captures the inhumanity, humiliation, cruelty and robbing of dignity caused by the laws of the period.

It is a period piece, set in 1950's South Africa and tells the heartfelt and heart-breaking story of two women who find each other under during a chance encounter which awakens an emotional connection that ultimately unites them in heart, mind and soul. This occurs during a time period, where mixed race relationships are considered criminal, and the country has taken for granted that this should be acceptable. That is, except for those that characters that fight to revolt against this, and believe in equality.

This includes Amina, the rebellious, courageous character (Sheetal Sheth) who ultimately reminds Miriam (Lisa Ray)-an oppressed and abused housewife, who has lost herself and her interests, in her ""role""- that she the latter has the strength to stand on her own and be who she wants to be-personally and professionally. Both Sheetal Sheth and Lisa Ray do an incredible job of conveying their individual plights on screen-sometimes with little spoken word and an artistic journey that entrenches you into their quiet pain, caused by the situation. Their scenes are some of the most skillful, yearning and heart-wrenching I have ever seen.

The story is told with such subtle and emotional complexity that I've rarely seen on film. Many feelings are conveyed with glances, the score itself, and unsaid words, which make this film incredibly powerful. Although the film leaves much implied, I was completely captivated by the power of the performances of the leads, as well as the supporting cast. I learned a great deal about the time period, as well as how much courage each character had to find within him/herself to ultimately emerge independent and dignified.

Amina is playful, bold, flirty and powerful and Miriam is reserved, curious and taken with Amina and all that she represents. There is passionate chemistry between the two female leads, who ultimately risk everything to grasp that which is most important-love for each other and for life and happiness. The film has an open end, but keen viewers can deduce the outcome and will remember this powerful story forever. This is the winner of numerous awards, including the official selection at the Toronto Film Festival & London Film Festival. Do not miss this film!

***SPOILER ALERT***

I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT-
=====================
This has taken its spot among my favorite romantic comedies of all time.  The soundtrack was up-tempo, fun and playful. The colors, costumes and set design where expertly integrated, and both this, and THE WORLD UNSEEN should be re-released on Blu-Ray (yes, I said that already!). The look of both films is amazing and begs for hi-definition treatment.

This time Shamim Sarif uses humor effectively to shed light on the cultural taboo of being in a same sex relationship. She re-casts Lisa Ray as the confident, bold and seductive Tala, working on her own business, opposite Sheetal Sheth as Leila, the shy, beautiful and insightful writer, and object of Tala's affections.

Together they explore this very forbidden, but inevitable love, and find their way to each other, with each other's help. But on the way, they are aided by friends in very humorous situations, and hindered by family members, still loyal to reserved tradition. The soundtrack is virtually its own character, as it includes catchy and sexy songs ranging from ethnic to ballad, which compliment Tala and Leila's journey perfectly.

The cultural taboo of being in this relationship is a relatable conundrum that many same sex couples have faced, and despite this film's focus on Jordanian and Indian cultures, the overarching theme of being threatened, disowned and shunned by family is universal and sadly, very relevant. All of the characters are funny and charming, and the dialogue is hilarious and smart, but never preachy.  I found it particularly interesting how the fathers in both THE WORLD UNSEEN and I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT were overall very supportive-another rare depiction, given the theme and cultures depicted.

Again, Shamim Sarif achieves the kind of crossover appeal, whether intentional or not, that allows the universal themes of unstoppable love to trump the sometimes ""hot button"" issues of gender, political and sexual orientation components. Both leads and the entire supporting cast envelop us with hope, laughter and inspiration. This is another wonderful achievement in bringing another one of her books to life on the screen. We love this movie, and have viewed it several times-each time picking up another funny line of dialogue and rooting for the characters all over again. We actually already owned it on DVD as it was released in the UK first. Yet, given the fantastic performances of these two actresses in THE WORLD UNSEEN, we saw I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT at the '09 Philly Gay Film Festival again, and several times since then.
These two films are truly must sees and the behind the scenes extras on both dvd's are great additions.

Regardless of your sexual orientation, or interest in the genres, I highly recommend these 2 pieces as examples of genius book to film transitions and films that stand on their own (I've not read the books yet), that deliver a poignant message of hope, equality, inspiration and entertainment. A special thank you to the director & writer for using her incredible talent to portray courageous, memorable and complex characters and real stories with universal themes![...]",1248393600,41,6785,5.13780598368087

Shamim Sharif fits a lot into her short films, revealing the varied conditions of life under which we all seek simply to love. Of course, Sheth and Ray are beautiful on-screen, but their characters are equally beautiful in their desires to grow into the lovers of humanity/each other/self they desire to be. See this film and The World Unseen - you will be glad you did.",1468540800,,654,5.064814814814815
3774743,5,B001RE9HDY,"This story which is set primarily against the backdrop of modern day London is an exciting look at how cultures and mores collide in this modern era. It also examines the entrenched and widely held beliefs and ideas concerning what is acceptable according to the norms of both cultures.  The conflict which evolves from this perception of right and wrong is played out and finally resolved when the lives of two kindred souls who are in love are faced with what can only be called their ultimate dichotomy.
Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth portray the star crossed lovers who must each come to terms both individually and collectively with not only their love for each but answer the question of right and wrong for themselves. The actresses performance allows you the viewer to feel, see and experience their emotional turmoil both within their relationship and interactions with others. You are also privy to the depths of their love for each other and the sacrifice each is willing to endure for the truth of their love. I have personally watched this film four times and can't seem to get enough. Yes the story is about women in love, but it's also the story of us all.

The movie explores unconditional love of fathers, the tension between mothers and daughters, the connection between family members, the exploration of friendship (Leyla's and Tala's loyal friends), and other themes themes through the tender relationship between these two women--all packed into less than 90 minutes with just the right touch of humor throughout.  These two women certainly clicked on screen.  Their chemistry and the director's skill created a bedroom scene that conveyed discovery, excitement, connection, and eroticism without nudity (spoiler alert?).  This is a terrific movie for anyone who has known love and longing and the joys and problems that accompany the experience.",1467504000,2,792,5.575

I did have to laugh when one character scans a room and decides the other must be gay based on book titles and a kd lang album. A true determination. The Hindi maid who spits in all Mom's food is priceless.  It's fun, it's sexy. It's all too rare to have a good laugh in lesbian film, so go for it.",1449360000,,442,4.261904761904762

3774804,4,B001RE9HDY,"This is one of the best "" well directed "" lesbian movie I have ever seen in years. Two beautiful, stunning women with great chemistry "" CLICK"" in their love making scene, though short and less spark; If only there's more in deepness,a little bit more of intimacy like the movie "" A Perfect Ending, When Night is Falling, Claire of the Moon- it would be much better. but I guess it has something to do with upper echelons of traditional middle eastern society as the story implies - not too boldly. ( maybe in the next sequel)
Lisa and Sheetal are perfectly made for this movie. And if they are real couple, we could easily follow them in all entertainment magazines. If we can clone these two- so we will just be watching and reading their lifestyle; then I think- but as Tala and Leyla .
I like that line when Tala says to Leyla, "" How I am going to find out what's going on beneath the quite texture of you"". That love letter she wrote to Leyla when she sent  her the bouquet of flowers. It's breathtaking, moving, so sensual I was having some "" goosebumps"" ah! LOL
I like all the cast members as they portrayed their role characters, esp. the two wonderful Dads who supported and accepted for who they are.
and the Moms who were shocked when Tala and Leyla came out as GAY. Imagine the look in their Moms faces-Like being hit by a thunderbolt. LOL
I like Leyla's sister Zara wearing the shirt "" I can't think straight"" and who made every effort so Tala and Leyla will be back together again.( thank God the pressure mounts on Tala until it cracks out of her, realized that she will be complete and alive again with Leyla)
I cannot wait and my friends to see another sequel of this movie-part 2 continues. This time they will get married ??church or mosque, Leyla's pregnancy thru in vitro fertilization as she continues to write at home, while Tala as a travelling businesswoman will be coming back and forth to tend Leyla's needs, after all she is the one who wants children. We shall see if she will be responsible to have kids, twin boys to give credit to both their Dads. I guess Sarif, the director and her team members knows best of what's next on part 2. Give credit to Hany ( Tala's X who will mary Miss World- ) I just hope that they are paid well with all the copyrights of this movie so the story will continue with Tala and Leyla. I think if there's no obstacles during filming and the budget is right, this movie will come much, much better.
Imagine all fans happy faces if they know part 2 of this movie is coming soon.
To viewers, do not think about the accent, family tradition, cultural differences and religious beliefs ok. Just concentrate on Tala and Leyla and
you will love it. More love making scene- yes ! then it will be 6 stars.
I definitely, absolutely recommend this to anyone, I mean anyone who just want to see a love story like this. Rent or Buy",1445731200,4,2878,4.349442379182156

3774894,5,B001RE9HDY,This is in my opinion one of the best Lesbian themed movies ever.  The chemistry between the two lead characters is absolutely awesome.  I have watched it over and over again and still get get goose bumps!!!,1398211200,,207,4.5675675675675675
3774895,5,B001RE9HDY,"This was an adorable love story between two very unlikely women.  I loved the cultural differences and understood why their romance was so difficult to display in their part of the world.

I loved the outcome and would definitely recommend buying the movie.  It's a keeper.",1397520000,,273,4.891304347826087

3774897,5,B001RE9HDY,"Very enjoyable to see these two ladies learn and teach each other living in cultures where their type of love is so taboo.
I recommend this very nicely made eye-opening look into romance from a non-Western viewpoint.  Their interaction with the members of their families  was quite interesting to watch.  Watch this for the passion, emotion, and sweetness of these leading ladies.",1396137600,,380,5.096774193548387
3774898,5,B001RE9HDY,A tale of two women who fall in lust with each other.  Sounds good but don't be fooled.  A story that has to be written by straight folks cause it just aint queer at al!  Fashionably gay I guess.  Seems lots about sex and nothing else.  I bought this dvd because Im queer and love stuff about my life style.

3774901,4,B001RE9HDY,"The only criticism I have is that the situation seemed a little too convenient, with too few entanglements getting in the way.  In particular, Leyla's Muslim background was dispensed with, with very little apparent pain, except on the part of her mother, which is unrealistic.  (Why couldn't she have been Hindu, by the way?  That would have made the relatively angst-free situation more believable, at least for Leyla and her father.) It was also a little too easy for Leyla's girlfriend-on-the-rebound to disappear without comment.  But, hey, this is romantic comedy:  both stars were beautiful and sweet, their chemistry was good and convincing, and I found the picture altogether charming.",1392422400,,693,5.263636363636364

3774904,4,B001RE9HDY,"Loved the movie.  The awakening of feelings and trying to push them down - that is human nature.  Serving up society's excuses as ""real reasons"" to deny how you feel, who you are, and how you want to live and who you truly love, that is fear.  Being a force that cannot and will not fold as others want, that is epic.  Those opposing forces make this movie worth watching, as well as, Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth.  Ethnicity and religion are used as back drops for defining society, family, and the box we can find ourselves existing.  Worth watching, more than once.",1391817600,,566,4.446601941747573
3774905,5,B001RE9HDY,"Too often, lesbian movies are concerned with sex for sex's sake, without much of a real story.  I Can't Think Straight is a very welcome exception. Tala and Leyla are developed into real, flesh-and -blood people, whom  the audience gets to know as each evolves into her true self. There's drama, comedy, and soul-searching that enlightens without preaching. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a mature, grown-up movie that captures your attention and your heart. By the way, the rest of the cast and the music are wonderful, too.

I read the reviews on Amazon before I watched it and concluded it MUST be good and that I would love the diversity. Well, I was wrong. I give the film credit for the cool music and the attempt to make a new Muslim-Indian romance film, but other than that it just didn't work for me. Maybe it was the acting and script that wasn't so convincing for me. I'm sure some will enjoy this movie, but I didn't get much out of it.",1390780800,,515,3.9615384615384617

It kind of surprised me that Tala was the shy one about coming out. At the beginning it looked like she would be the one to push Leyla to accept her sexuality and come out to her parents. And loved the t-shirt that Leyla's sister was wearing. That moment was hilarious. It's a great movi. Definitely worth the time.",1386806400,,474,4.588235294117647

As written in other reviews, it's about two ""straight"" women, one of whom is engaged, who fall in love.  It's a funny, warm, tender, and insightful film.  The coming out process is at the heart of the story and their conflicts.  Well worth time.",1384128000,,478,4.488372093023256

It dealt with things in a non bias and sensitive manner without putting across any personal oppinions or slants on any one culture. The music and colour of this movie made it memorable.

I take my hat off to Shamim Sarif and her production crew for TWU for the labor of love that they put into this film---it is superbly  and insanely well done considering the limited budget.. with an incredible cast",1380672000,,273,4.808510638297872
3774929,3,B001RE9HDY,"""I Can't Think Straight"" is a good lesbian love affair movie which could've been a whole lot better.
The story is of a Christian Arab (Jordanian) girl (Tala) who's on her 4th engagement, and isn't perfectly happy  with this one either!
(She'd dumped the first 3, usually on or near the day of their wedding!)
The other woman (Leyla) is a shy but confident Muslim from Israel, who is striving to be a novelist.
They meet while living in London (through a mutual friend), fall in love, break up, then resolve everything at the end.
It has the makings of a wonderful little movie, except ""I Can""t Think Straight"" got the recipe wrong.
First, it's too short, at 80 minutes.  Another 20 to 30 minutes would've helped.
Second, it can't decide whether it's a drama with comedic elements, or a comedy with dramatic elements.
The housekeeper has some hilarious scenes, enhanced by her facial gestures.
But Tala's mom makes some anti-semitic remarks in Leyla's presence.
This brings out equally disparaging remarks by Tala about Israel's penchant for ""murdering children""!!
While discussion of Israeli-Arab disunity is welcome, it doesn't quite fit in a romantic comedy!!
Third, there's just one really serious bedroom scene, yet both actresses remain almost fully clothed--not a bare breast or rear end in sight!!
While nudity and graphic sex aren't really necessary in a great lesbian movie, heat is enhanced by the rubbing of two bodies together.  These women barely even touch each other, for the most part.
Add a half hour to ""flesh out"" (pun intended!) the story, do a bit of revision, and you've got yourself a potential 5-star movie!!
But it's still worth your time!!",1380672000,2,1665,4.918149466192171
3774930,5,B001RE9HDY,"There was romance. conflict within the characters which I believe is so current in today's world. I liked the chemistry in the main characters. My one dislike, which was minimal, was what the maid was doing. I think this was more drama than comedy so the maid thing wasn't needed, it took something away from the movie for me. I would recommend this movie it just had a little of everything and I really enjoyed it",1379548800,,414,4.4605263157894735
3774931,5,B001RE9HDY,It's my all-time favorite movie. Thanks for making it easy and convenient to get.  I can identify with Talia. It's hard to go against the grain. But when your motivated by love anything is possible.,1379030400,,198,4.6571428571428575

Lisa Ray is so beautiful. i think, however, that I like Sheetal's character in the movie better because it seems like she knows what she wants. Lisa's character is too conflicted and worried what others will think, and when it comes to your own happiness, that shouldn't be the case...I would think, anyway. Definitely a movie that you should see.",1378771200,,445,4.792207792207792

Low. Where is the anticipation,the desire,the passion !!!The two women seem to have
No desire what so ever,or at least we don't get to see it. Probably because the director is so insistent on stuffing her movie with negative comments about different
Cultures and religions. Save it for the soapbox will ya !!!
If your looking for terrfifc loves scenes then this is definately not the film for you. Did the actresses have a no nudity clause in their contracts ?
The only reason I gave this movie 1 star was because some of the dialogue was good.
Don't waste your money buying this movie rent it instead,if you must.
If you want to see what a really good independent movie maker does,then take a look
At A Perfect Ending,Elena Undone,or The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister.",1378080000,5,858,4.471337579617835
3774934,5,B001RE9HDY,"What I love about this movie is, it's about two women trying to be in a healthy relationship, not the usual, secretive, suicidal, crazy dramatic, unhealthy relationships of gay film past. This movie has set a new standard for lesbian films, I hope. I really hate that term ""lesbian film."" To me, this is a chick flick. It's like ""Imagine Me and You"" only there's two WONDERFUL love scenes. Both actresses were phenomenal, and I really love that they seemed completely comfortable with each other. There's nothing more frustrating than watching two actresses who are completely uncomfortable kissing another woman. Not these two. Their chemistry was amazing. My biggest complaint is that it's kind of short, but I also know it's because it's an Indie film. Lower budget and all that. But for what the director had to work with, she definitely made a quality film. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who enjoys chick flicks, gay or straight or whatever in between.",1377734400,,973,4.903030303030303

However, that is definitely not the case here.  This is an honest-to-goodness romantic comedy that just happens to involve the relationship between two women.  It's not laugh out loud funny, but thoroughly amusing throughout.  And unlike many so-called romantic comedies (lesbian or otherwise), it's actually fairly plausible and realistic.  The women are wonderful and have incredible chemistry.  They are just beautiful together.  In fact, all the actors are first-rate.  This one is not to be missed.",1371686400,,643,5.424242424242424

The passion among the two of them is palpable and the watcher will hope that they finally will get together for the whole movie.

However love is not the only relevant topic in this movie: the confrontation among different cultures and religions that appears in several conversations gives to the viewer the opportunity to reflect on important themes  of contemporary.

3774955,4,B001RE9HDY,"I love this movie, I really do. I have seen it many, many times and would LOVE to own it. But the cover art on the current DVD is so trashy and sleazy (and deceptive) that I CANNOT bring myself to make the purchase; I cannot support what seems to be a clear effort to sell this movie with sex when sex is really not what the movie is about. It has so very many merits, and I would love to see someone transfer a few of those to the cover. Movie's not about sex kittens. I think the cover art demeans what takes place between the two characters (not to mention the rest of the film), transforming it into something lustful which is a complete betrayal of the film. Somebody change the cover art and you will have a new customer; you will probably have many new customers. And fewer disgruntled customers who, from the cover, purchased this movie thinking it was something that it isn't.

3774967,4,B001RE9HDY,"The main characters are:
Tala - a Middle Eastern woman living in London; She is just about to get married to a rich Middle Eastern man. She has been engaged 3 times before and has broken off the engagements just before marriage. Her family hopes this marriage will go through.
Leyla - a 16-year-old British Indian woman living in London (The actress is obviously not 16 and whenever the dialogue mentioned she is 16, I found myself surprised. She looks late 20s/early 30s.)

I liked the movie, but I think there is a bit of room for improvement. Character development was lacking and the plot line jumps around a bit making you feel a bit lost at times. But - with that said and the fact that there are not many decent lesbian movies out there - I think this movie is definitely worth watching.

The two women meet on a double date to play tennis. Instantly there is competition and challenge between them. Tala is the one who comes across as a billy to the younger Leyla. I felt like the two women were disliking each other and then all-of-a-sudden they are going away together staying in the same hotel room. And then they have a few moments of dancing together in the hotel room and then there is kissing and desire. It seemed to come out of nowhere. I think the author thought the competition was the smoldering embers of desire, but it didn't seem that way to me.

The love scene between the two women is a collage of images of the two of them kissing and caressing. Nice to watch, don't get me wrong, but I would have preferred a real love scene that showed a blooming of their passion along with some hesitation about what they were getting into. Considering this was Leyla's first sexual experience with a woman (and maybe even with anyone) she seemed right at home with what was unfolding and had no hesitation about what to do. I can see that the director did not necessarily want this to be a coming-of-age movie, but there could have been a moment or two spent to show the epiphany of Leyla's realization that she is a lesbian.

I give the movie a lot of artistic license and forgive a lot of the plot shortcomings because the actresses are both very attractive and there is chemistry between the two actresses.

Both of the women are very privileged and come from rich families. Their heritage plays into the difficulties with family expectations in pursuing a lesbian lifestyle. But the fact that both of their families are filthy rich and that each of the women's fathers adore them help to cushion their coming out experience and make it relatively easy. Easier than Tala would have you believe.

All in all, a good watch but not on my top 10 list.",1361750400,,2664,4.493801652892562
3774968,3,B001RE9HDY,"The two leads have such great chemistry - the romance is mixed with middle eastern politics lite, and it works. A film I watch over and over. It's not got the production values of The World Unseen, but works on its own level.",1361664000,,225,4.255813953488372

3774973,4,B001RE9HDY,"and a bonus movie sound track. The only regret is they don't have English subtitles. In one of the scenes of  ""The World Unseen"", the two characters were whispering, without the subtitle, I couldn't understand what they were saying.",1359936000,,232,4.948717948717949
3774974,1,B001RE9HDY,"The real agenda in this movie is not lesbian relationships and social acceptance, but anti-Semitism and anti-Israel propaganda. At every conversation, the Arab characters are saying something derogatory about the Jews or Israel. Their lies and hateful remarks are very reminiscent of Nazi propaganda. Example of what the Arabs in the movie said; ""Israelis kill children, so that's why the Palestinians suicide bombers are justified in killing Israeli children, who grow up to be soldiers"". Or; ""The last thing we need are more Jews in the Middle East"" or; ""Israel stole the Palestinians land"". Everyone who knows anything about Israeli history, Jewish people and the atrocities of the Palestinians knows there is nothing further from the truth.

Even when one character is ""defending"" Israel she still lies! She said; ""Israel is the closest thing to democracy in the middle east"". Excuse me, correction; ISRAEL IS A DEMOCRACY, ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE,  WHILE EVERY SINGLE ARAB OR MOSLEM COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A DICTATORSHIP (excluding  Turkey, which is a Moslem but not Arab country, and has a relative democracy, not a real democracy like Israel).

One of the Arab women in the movie has a Jewish boyfriend and she wants to marry him, but she is DISGUSTED, because he wants to raise their future kids Jewish.
Enough said, I rest my case!
The Arab Palestinian characters are Christians from Jordan, not Moslems like almost all Palestinians are, and are played by Canadian actors from Indian decent, and that's why they appear so westernized, wealthy and well educated. Again, this is not depicting reality even remotely. And why are they spewing pro-Palestinian propaganda, since Jordan has had a lasting peace with Israel for the last 19 years? It's all very questionable!

As far as the Lesbian subject, it is also very unrealistic; the 2 young gorgeous women had no gay tendencies at all until they meet, and out of the blue fall in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together. Again, very unrealistic and unbelievable. The only people who would like this movie are the ones who enjoy looking at sex scenes with 2 beautiful women. Since I am not one of these people, I didn't care for this movie at all and stopped watching it midway. The hateful anti-Semitism made me very angry and I just didn't want to waste another minute on this crap. It is shameful how the Arab lesbian director built this whole ridiculous fantasy about the ""admirable, glorious, innocent Palestinians"" who are victimized by the ""blood thirsty Jews"".

Ha ha...it should be billed as a black comedy.",1359590400,7,2606,4.924829157175399

Their struggle to find themselves and to defy convention, especially in their conservative culture, was moving. The remaining characters and the environment of the film were rather formulaic, however, reminding me of a middle eastern soap opera. There were only a few bright spots in the cast, such as brother from New York, and the political diatribe was overplayed.

So far I can ONLY see the movie by using my computer. That's a downer. Apart from that, this is a great well crafted film by author and director Shamim Sarif. I've not come across a more delightful cast of actors, for a film with this type of subject matter, that breathed such life into the characters that they portrayed. The main actors played by Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth will forever be emblazened across your heart as brave individuals who dared to follow their hearts instead follow the traditions of their culture. When you view this film you can certainly feel what the pressures of today's society, along with those that come from family and friends, and not with standing today dynamics of couples and marriage must consist of. This film is a well deserved, acclaimed and award winning movie by both actors and director on several continents.

This is a good adaptation of the book by the same name. The story is essentially girls from different backgrounds meet and fall in love, and then deal with the implications of it.

3775035,5,B001RE9HDY,"I watched this DVD about 15 times before it went wonky and I had to buy a new DVD copy of this movie.  What does this film have that I love? Beautiful woman, romantic storyline, beautiful backdrops, romantic and erotic lovemaking (that's not explicit but still very erotic), a compelling storyline, but most of all, a happy ending.  The movie concerns two women, one an English Christian Jordanian, the other an English Muslim Indian, who fall in love but feel stiffled by their respective cultures, religions and family and the expected roles they are supposed to play (be straight and marry).  Falling in love is so out of their expectations, they both freak out a bit but their attraction to each other is undeniable. Lisa Ray is the PERFECT romantic lead and is quite fetching and debonair as Tala and I ate her up in this movie.  I only had a few minor issues with this DVD, namely it was too short (this movie is less than 90 minutes long) and my DVD crapped out of me, which had never happened to me before (I own about 350 DVDs). Despite that, I did not hesitate to buy another copy of this wonderful movie.  Like the title of my says, this is one of my favorite lesbian movies, which is saying a lot.

3775040,3,B001RE9HDY,"In purchasing the combo pack of 2 movies by writer/director Shamim Sarif I believe I recieved quite a bit for my investment. In addition to the 2 films, there is a soundtrack included. As for the films themselves, I was not overly impressed with the acting.  Sad to say, the actresses performances were par for the course as it pertains to lesbian films which means that they were 2 beautiful, straight women with zero chemistry undertaking the daunting task of persuading an audience (predominantly lesbian) that they are falling deeply in love. That said, I did notice a progression in believablity from one film to the next chronologically speaking.  ""I Can't Think Straight,"" made in 2008, delivers some funny moments (like the coming out scene) and witty lines, but not even a hint of attraction between the leading ladies.  The second film, ""The World Unseen"" 2009 reunites the same actresses but reveals a more believable connection and superior acting especially from Lisa Ray whose preformance is provocative and quite moving.  She has the ablity to bestow much with her face without uttering a word.  This is a heavy movie tackling everything from South African Apartheid to domestic violence and rape.  Top this off with the angst of a married mother of 3 coming to terms with homosexual urges in the 1950's and you may need a shot of tequilla to make it thru.  It is worth the trip though. Lastly, if you're anticipating sensual and well orchestrated sex scenes that movies like ""When Night Is Falling"" or ""Elena Undone"" deliver - leave that pipe dream at the door.  These ladies seem to espouse the belief that lesbians make love with their clothes on or perhaps they don't make love at all.",1305072000,,1704,4.831615120274914

3775061,5,B001RE9HDY,"I Can't Think Straight is a beautiful story of timeless love and how it transcends personal fears, cultural boundaries, religious differences, familial fortifications and gender confines to triumph over every adversity and uncertainty.

Tala and Leyla have a chance meeting and find the comfort and connection they had been seeking. The bliss of companionship ends when the moment of truth confronts them. Tala makes the easier and more acceptable choice. She breaks Leyla's heart to follow conventions. Leyla defies conventions to find contentment. The all-pervasive feeling of love consumes Tala and finally gives her the courage to face challenges and win Leyla back.

In spite of the intense theme Shamim Sarif's presentation is light and comic never compromising on the sensitivity of the subject. The story brilliantly intertwines varied facets of life with well defined characters - parents, sisters, boyfriends, housekeeper - offering the requisite dimensions eventually leading to a desirable ending. The canvas of the film is colorful, lavish and expansive.

Sheetal Sheth effortlessly steals every scene in the show. Whether it is imploring Tala with ""tell me you can do this..."" or coming out to her mother with ""I haven't killed or stolen..."" she portrays heart breaking vulnerability. Her eyes ooze sensuality and her voice echoes in the heart. Lisa Ray looks so enthralling that one rarely has the chance to move past her appearance. Sheetal Sheth makes up for any performance deficits in their scenes together. The chemistry between them is irrefutable.

The music of the film elevates it to a transcendental experience.",1286409600,6,1636,5.37890625

I've posted detailed reviews of both movies under the separate DVD's, as the reviews were too long to post in a single review here. But here's a summary:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Can-t-Think-Straight/dp/B002SF9YTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Can't Think Straight</a>&nbsp;- Promising Debut Film: I wavered between 3 and 4 stars, but ultimately gave it 4 stars. I considered 3 stars because: the story is predictable; I didn't get why the women were attracted to each other in the first place; most conflicts are glossed over or just magically non-existent; there was too much dialogue and not enough acting; and the acting was a bit stiff and blunt in places. Ultimately I gave it 4 stars because: I really appreciated the treatment of these oh-so-familiar issues in a new (to me) cultural context; there was good humor - I laughed out loud in places; the lead actresses are gorgeous and have good chemistry together; and it's a positive, upbeat lesbian romance.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-Unseen/dp/B0038M61IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World Unseen</a>&nbsp;- Brilliant!: Unequivocal 5 stars. The story is compelling; the pacing is perfect; the context is rich and expertly developed; the acting across the board is precise, restrained and revealing; the cinematography is excellent; and that kiss in Miriam's bedroom continues to haunt me, even weeks later - the laser's burning a hole in the DVD at that point in the movie! Really, IMO this movie is on a par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desert-Hearts/dp/B000OVLC0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desert Hearts</a>&nbsp;as one of the finer, more professional lesbian movies ever made. [In fact, in the credits Shamim Sarif thanks Donna Deitch, the director of Desert Hearts. I wonder what role Deitch played in producing this movie???]

So why do I recommend buying the set instead of just buying The World Unseen? 1) If you're going to watch The World Unseen, which I strongly recommend, it's nice to see I Can't Think Straight first. (I like watching movies in order.) Also, 2) I think Sarif is a woman to watch. I Can't Think Straight was her directorial debut, and although it was clearly a debut, still she did a great job. I watched the special features and learned about some of the challenges she faced on that film, and really I think she did an amazing job given the obstacles she had to overcome. And her second film, The World Unseen, is indeed superb. So I suspect I'm going to end up collecting her work, and I like having a complete collection. 3) Finally, there's not enough in the way of love scenes in The World Unseen. I understand that more love scenes wouldn't have been consistent with the story Sarif was trying to tell. But, lord, those women are so beautiful and the characters so sympathetic that I really, really wanted more. So it's nice to go back to I Can't Think Straight so I can watch them be together! ;-)

The bonus CD in the set is also nice. Here's the track listing:
1) Alabina (fun, zippy Middle Eastern)
2) Number One Boy
3) Hey Girl
4) Little Feeling (the movie's them song)
5) Mirror, Mirror
6) Ma Fini Fakker (mellow Middle Eastern)
7) Tell Me
8) Underground
9) Kidda (mellow Middle Eastern)
10) Hey My Baby
11) Ghanwa Bossanova (mellow Middle Eastern)
12) Holy Daughter (nice fusion between American pop and Middle Eastern)
13) Love Theme (very brief instrumental)
14) I Kissed A Girl (yes, the same pop tune that's de rigeur for lesbian films)

So all in all, I think this set is a great value. You get one good movie, one superb movie and a bonus CD with some interesting Middle Eastern music. Plus, you support Sarif so she can bring us more great work, which I'm confident she will.",1277337600,4,4270,5.602167182662539
3775075,4,B001RE9HDY,"This is the first of 2 collaborations between the same team: writer / director Shamim Sarif, producer (and Sarif's life and business partner) Hanan Kattan, and actors Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth. It's also Sarif's directorial debut.

The story: 4 stars
The film opens in a palatial home in Jordan, where preparations are being made for Tala's wedding. Tala (Lisa Ray) has broken 3 previous engagements, so there's an air of tension / uncertainty, and perhaps a bit of urgency. Tala turns out to be a rebellious free spirit who's strident in her opinions, but unable to commit to any course of action. We then cut to London, where we meet Leyla, a young Indian Muslim woman, daughter of an insurance salesman and a traditional Indian mother. Leyla (Sheetal Sheth) is observant and thoughtful, seeking, and on the verge of finding, her own truth, to which she longs to commit. The two meet in London through Leyla's boyfriend, and the story unfolds.

I would've given the story 3 stars because it's pretty predictable, and honestly I didn't really get what attracted the two main characters to each other - they just seemed to fall in together for no particular reason. Also, most conflicts were glossed over or just magically non-existent. But I upgraded it to 4 stars because it was so refreshing to see these issues in a new (to me) cultural context. I really appreciated that fresh perspective. Also, there's some good humor - I did laugh out loud in places. And, at the end of the day, it's a positive, upbeat lesbian romance.

The film: 3-1/2 stars
This is clearly a directorial debut. There's too much dialogue (telling) and not enough action / acting (showing). The music is good, there are some interesting scenes / shots / cuts, and overall the story does flow. But I thought the acting was a little blunt and stiff in places, and there wasn't a lot of depth. However, I watched the special features and learned about some of the challenges the team faced in producing the film, and I do have to give credit to Sarif: I think she did a great job overcoming those obstacles, particularly since this was her first time out. By the the time I finished with the DVD, I ended up thinking Sarif is a woman to watch - she's going to bring us some great stuff. [I've since watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-Unseen/dp/B0038M61IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World Unseen</a>, which is the second collaboration between the same team, and it was indeed absolutely brilliant! So I'm definitely keeping my eye on Sarif.]

There is a little joke in the film. At the book signing near the end of the film, one of the women who gets her book signed by Leyla asks that the autograph be made out to Amina, and Leyla comments about what a lovely name that is. The woman getting her book signed is played by the director, Sarif, and Amina is the name of the character that Sheetal Sheth will play in their next film, The World Unseen. Cute. A wink and a nod right back at ya, Shamim. :-)

Summary:
Despite some of the rough edges in the film, it's still definitely worth watching. I really enjoyed the glimpse into the personal / familial side of unfamiliar (to me) cultures. And, if you're planning on seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-Unseen/dp/B0038M61IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World Unseen</a>, which I highly recommend, it's good to see this first.

I think there's more great stuff to come from Sarif, hopefully including Sheth and Ray, both of whom are talented and captivatingly gorgeous.

Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth are SUPERB.  I felt Leyla's coming out scene was very moving - particulary her father's reaction.  I do not like Leyla's line to her mother, ""Well I don't accept it!!"", however.  I think this is a key moment in the film to think about....

I look forward to watching Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth in future performances.  They commited fully to their characters and it is easy to see why audiences project their characters onto the actresses.  They did a really good job.

3775090,5,B001RE9HDY,"I enjoyed this film.  I was tired of the old lesbian movies where you lost the girl and committed suicide.  I always wonder why was it that all the straight movies were so much better than ours.  I realized that it was b/c the guy always gets the girl.  The little handful of movies that I've seen, seems to finally get it ""girl gets girl"".  The story line was very interesting but no strange to real life situation.  It's beautiful to see through the eyes of love all of those places or things you already experienced before on your own (the girls at Oxford).  I must say that all the girls in this movie were gorgeous; two thumbs up!
I'm not going to go into details of the movie as other critics have done a good job at it. I'm going to add one thing, they did a good job but I would have like to see a bit more passion in their acting when they were kissing or intimate.  I've learned that a lot of these actresses are all straight and thus their kisses are more of mental condition (I have to, it's in my contract) than something that they would feel naturally if they had a guy in front of them.  Perhaps we should use lesbians actresses to reach that extra level of real art in films. Would you use apples to make orange juices?
That of course is my humble opinion.  Overall it's a great movie and I do recommend it.",1267920000,3,1323,4.173228346456693

Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth two very accomplished Actors take on the role of two women from similar cultures with very different approaches to their embrace of a relationship frowned upon and discouraged in both of their cultures. Ray from Palestine could possibly be put to death for even entertaining the thought of a life lived with a woman; and openly would not happen. The character Tala portrayed by Ray has had a previous relationship but explained away her desire. Leyla portrayed by Sheth finds herself and refuses to deny what she truly feels.

3775094,4,B001RE9HDY,"Despite its few flaws, I really, really like this movie. In fact, I am not a movie person and also tend to not watch a movie again once I've seen it...I've watched this several times, particularly my favorite scenes, since first seeing the movie maybe a month ago from the time of this review. Of course, this movie does fall along the lines of a typical cheesy, unbelievable love story, except for this is about lesbians. But since that's to be expected, that's not really the problem I had with it. I liked the two main characters, and there were some funny moments in the movie. Both girls were smart and Tala, in particular, was very opinionated. Both seemed to be trying to find themselves and take control of their own lives aside from coming out. The socio-political and cultural commentary/arguments from the characters made the movie at least a tad deeper than the typical love story of this variety.

I probably have about two big issues with this movie, though:

1) I feel like all the ads I saw of this movie pushed not just the typical difficulty of coming out as a storyline in this movie, but also made it seem like the two women would battle cultural differences in their relationship. I didn't particularly find this to be the case, and that was probably the thing that interested me most about this movie. There have been lesbian flicks that have tackled interracial dating, but the interracial aspect was not really an issue that was emphasized. I was looking forward to seeing inter-ethnic and inter-faith issues at the heart of the relationship here and see how the women handled it. But nothing really happened there beyond Tala's telling Layla, ""This is no way to live. People in my country wouldn't understand or accept it"" or something along those lines. There was nothing like their being together and struggling with disapproval from family and friends and others because of differences in their background on top of being lesbians. The main focus really did turn out to be just admitting to themselves that they liked women, not men, and getting together...which moves this movie a lot closer to being like every other lesbian flick out there. There was a great opportunity here to do something different and more thought-provoking, and it wasn't taken.

2) To continue my last thought...probably the reason the movie didn't come out with more issues tackled is because of timing. It's as if the people who came up with this movie wanted to do so much and they just couldn't. Aside from not really getting into the background difference, I felt the movie also kind of skipped the part where it made sense that these two fell for each other. Or at least didn't flesh it out well. It was more like, because we knew it was coming, we were supposed to just accept it rather than really see this great chemistry or connection building because of some incident or conversation or any other trigger. I wouldn't even say it was a thing where they both looked at each other the first time meeting and just felt something. Their first meeting was odd, to me, actually (Layla kind of got grilled by both Tala and her mother...how does that make you get interested in someone romantically?). Their second meeting was odd, also (they had this competitive tennis match, and then they were sharing some moment in the locker room (or whatever that place was)...??). Maybe it's just a cultural difference, as an American, but I still don't feel like I see what drew them to each other.
---

Conclusion: Entertaining movie with a little more to offer than the standard love story. But they (producers and writers) obviously wanted to get political messages across, depict cultural differences, show two people struggling with their orientation and how they work that out, and show a love story. They don't really balance all this successfully. Still, the movie somehow manages to be quite charming with likable characters and includes some nice love-making scenes, and the little bit that they could include along with the coming out/love story makes this movie stand out more than other lesbian flicks.",1265932800,5,4113,4.805084745762712
3775095,5,B001RE9HDY,"I originally bought this movie as a package deal with ""The World Unseen"" as both these movies have the same writer/director/leading ladies and were made about a year apart. They ended up being released the same time, I think, due to some financial issues that occurred that stopped the release of one for awhile. And this is how I recommend you watch them as well-- together.

Maybe they are not ""great"" pieces of writing and film making in the eye of most pompous critics and grumpy, over judgmental lesbos who eat their own... but in the world of LGBT movies... I think this one is right up there with the best. And what's great is all relative anyway. In my personal opinion... I just loved these movies-- the leading ladies, and all the love and passion that went into making these films on such a limited budget (the lesbian writer/director Shamim Sarif is an amazing talent that you should read up on). Plus they found me during a lonely vacation and kept me smiling... and I really appreciate a story that has that effect and timing in my life.

And don't even get me started on Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth. Gorgeous, gorgeous beauties who really bring the film to life with great acting and amazing chemistry. You will totally fall in love with them! What is especially great about watching these two films together is that the roles of the leading ladies flip... Lisa Ray is the rebellious, outgoing one in ""I Can't Think Straight""... and then a much more passive, shy housewife in ""The World Unseen."" Same with Sheetal... she's the nice girl-next-door in ""I Can't Think Straight"" and then is the Indian variety Idgie Threadgood outgoing dyke in ""The World Unseen.""

It's just plain sexy watching these women get switchy with each other... so whatever drama caused the delay in the first movie to be released was for good reason in the end. These movies belong together as much as the leading ladies do... ""I Can't Think Straight"" is mostly comedy and ""The World Unseen"" is mostly drama... they have different moods and each have their own special charm.

I haven't enjoyed a lesbian movie this much since Fingersmith and Tipping the Velvet. I highly recommend it.",1265328000,6,2172,4.707894736842105
3775096,4,B001RE9HDY,This combo DVD pack is a great way to support women film makers. The DVD I Can't think straight presents a diverse view of the lesbian experience. Production values were slightly better than many lesbian films. The DVD World Unseen presents a interesting story from a moment in time in South Africa's history and a perspective that is not often seen in mainstream media. I think both DVD are a cut above the usual fair of lesbian movies you can find available.,1264204800,6,460,4.621951219512195
3775097,3,B001RE9HDY,"I'm not an expert reviewer, but since this particular movie only has one review, I thought I'd throw my two cents in.  The other reviewer already wrote a synopsis of what the movie is about, so I'm not going to focus on the plot very much.  What I am going to focus on is how this lesbian-genre movie holds up as a whole compared to others.

I feel like I've seen MANY different lesbian films, being the fan I am, and as much as I looked forward to this movie coming out, I found myself very disappointed.  I'm not sure what it was exactly, but the acting in the movie just wasn't very good for one.  Although, the two leading ladies did a very good job.  In fact, if you like Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheath, I recommend watching the lesbian film, ""The World Unseen"", in which they also star.  That movie, by far, moved me and entertained me more in terms of the better plot and more believability than this one did.  I'd rate this particular movie along with ""Imagine Me & You"" and ""Gray Matters"", although I found myself not really caring about the lead characters as much as I did in those two movies.  Another great, but slightly underrated lesbian movie to watch is ""Nina's Heavenly Delights"".  I found myself thinking of that movie while watching this one because of a few similiarities and wishing I felt for the characters as much as I did while I was watching ""NHD's"".

I'm not saying ""I Can't Think Straight"" is horrible.  Growing up in a time of very limited lesbian genre movies, it's nice to see a movie in favor of lesbian relationships even as cliched as this one is.  I was mildy entertained, but I knew exactly what was going to happen after twenty minutes into the movie.  Perhaps, it's just my biased opinion based on the many different kind of lesbian films and my particular taste in films, but if you're in the mood for a light, quirky, fun-for-the-family (Well, maybe not the WHOLE family...) movie, this one will do.  If you're interested in something deeper then ""The World Unseen"", ""Nina's Heavenly Delights"", ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"", and ""Loving Annabelle"", are the lesbian movies for you.",1263945600,12,2119,4.524934383202099

3775099,4,B001RE9HDY,"Not since D.E.B.S. have I found myself watching two DVDs over and over.  ""I can't Think Str8"" (along with its sister flick ""The World Unseen"") is a very enjoyable movie about two women from two very different cultures doing something very simple; falling in love.

I had never heard of either Lisa Ray or Sheetal Sheth before watching these films.  I watched ""The World Unseen"" first (before realizing that it was actually filmed after ""I Can't Think Str8"").  That movie took us to a world that I'd rather forget; apartheid South Africa. Being African American of mixed-race ancestry, I totally identified with both Sheth's courageous character Amina and that of her business partner, the quiet ""Coloured"" Jacob.  Ray's character in that movie, Miriam, was almost difficult to watch; a tortured housewife and mother living in a loveless marriage with a dude who cheats on her and slaps her around.  Ray brought a quiet grace to the character (her hand gestures spoke volumes) and watching how the two women in that movie fall in love is almost poetic.

""I can't Think Straight"" takes place mostly in present-day London.  Ray is rich Palestinian Christian and Sheth is an upper-middle class Indian Muslim.  Both women's roles in this film are almost polar opposites of their roles in ""World.""  Ray's Tala is the outgoing character with the snappy lines and Arabic rhythm.  Sheth's Leyla is shy, but savvy.  Unlike ""World,"" ""I Can't Think Straight"" has very enjoyably erotic love scenes as well. In addition, both movies have very interesting supporting players.

Three themes seem to invade both films.  One, each film has very positive father characters.  In ""World,"" Amina's dad is very encouraging of his independent daughter's work and personal life.  In ""Straight,"" Both Tala and Leyla's dads seem to support the various decisions that they reach.  On the other hand, the mothers in the films are less than loveable, particularly Tala's domineering mother in ""Straight.""

The second theme is that each woman has an important man in her life.  For ""World's"" Amina, the only character in either film who identifies as a dyke from the jump, it's her business partner, Jacob.  For Miriam, it's her jerk of a husband, Omar.  In ""Straight,"" Tala is engaged to the very sympathetic Hani, while Leyla is dating the equally nice guy, Ali (who also happens to be Tala's best bud).

The third theme is the presence of the nice sister and the [...] sister.  In ""World"" the nice sister is Miriam's husband's twin sister, who is on the lam from the Afrikaner police for being married to a white dude.  The [...] sister is Miriam's husband's brother's wife (also trapped in a loveless marriage), who is sleeping with Miriam's husband.  In ""Straight,"" the nice sister is Tala's sister Zina (which fits since ""Xena"" is a lesbian icon) while Tala's other sister, Lamia, who is likewise trapped in a loveless marriage, is a total [...].

Okay, perhaps a fourth theme present is the ""trapped in a loveless marriage"" theme.

Rich characters and compelling acting make both movies very watchable.

I'd like to add that I have since learned that Lisa Ray is battling cancer.  I'm rooting for her to pull through it.  She's a talent of which we need to see much more.",1263427200,4,3247,4.893772893772894

I guess both women would come to terms with their homosexuality in a different way if they had been living in the far east.

I loved the script, the photography, and the directing. Their acting is superb and the music is well chosen, couldn't have been better. I watched it 3 times already, and could easily watch it a couple of more times. The actresses are a delight to the eyes, they are both charismatic and gorgeous. It's one of my top 10 lesbian movies.

8337791,5,B001RE9HDY,"Absolutely fantastic!!! I don't just recommend it, I highly encourage it!! It doesn't have the nitty gritty sex scenes I was hoping for based on the look of the cover of the movie, but  that was more than ok with me. It left enough for my imagination. And I must say, the picture cover is silly. It's NOTHING like the movie, which is actually better!! The cover makes the actresses look very cheap/brothel like. Which is the exact opposite of how they are portrayed. This movie does an EXCELLENT job of showing how hard it is to be who you are in an expected role, and the struggles you go through when in love with someone who feels they shouldn't break hierarchy rules for their family. All the while, each character is struggling with her own sexual identity. This movie is something everyone should watch. The main male characters do a fantastic job of being supporting roles which EVERYONE needs more of. Kudos to the director AND actors.",1518220800,4,943,4.613095238095238
8337792,5,B001RE9HDY,"I just love this movie! The two leads are such good actresses and have amazing chemistry!! The supporting characters are equally great... and funny! So many lesbian story lines are dull, stereotypical, and have horrible endings...this one is heartwarming and hopeful. Overall excellent movie!",1517184000,,292,5.659090909090909

The soundtrack cuts in and out at several locations during the film. This has happened with 2 separate DVD's. Although this is unfortunate it doesn't really interfere with the film as the glitches are of short duration and most happen in between dialogue. Don't let this stop you from buying this film as it is brilliant.",1516492800,,547,6.405405405405405
