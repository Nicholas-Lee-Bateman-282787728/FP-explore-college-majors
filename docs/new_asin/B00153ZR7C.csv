3140139,5,B00153ZR7C,"This is a spectacular documentary on Guadalcanal.  It is the 2 disc version of the Timeless Media Group's Guadalcanal - Island of Death Documentary.  There is a one disc version which has 9 reviews.  This one has the wrong pubisher listed on the Amazon description which is why it might not get the proper attention it deserves.

It is nearly 4 hours (230 minutes) in length and does a specatacular job of telling the story. It contains commentary from 3 different historians and several veterans of the battle. It does a great job of highighting the ships lost in the various naval engagements. It does a nice job of comparing the aircraft involved.  It uses computer animated maps to show troop movements for the major battles.

Here are the chapters on the two discs.

8257344,5,B00153ZR7C,For all WWII historians this the definitive DVD  for the story of the brave American service men who fought this horrific battle.  It should be a must see for every public school student.,1433462400,,187,4.636363636363637

8257347,5,B00153ZR7C,"I am very happy with this purchase, the fight for Guadalcanal was the springboard for our island hopping conquests in the pacific.  My only regret, is the lack of color films of that battle.  Color filming really brings the struggle alive, you really feel the intensity of the fighting. Other than that , this is a great military dvd.  JRV",1364515200,,339,4.616666666666666
8257348,5,B00153ZR7C,"Great documentary.  Good use of veteran interviews. Some stock footage, but a lot of footage I have not seen used.  Highly recommended.",1356480000,,135,5.090909090909091
8257349,5,B00153ZR7C,"This dvd is excellent in telling of the first island invasion
on the road to victory over the Jappanese.  It took 6 months
to secure the island and it was touch and go during that time.
This dvd is well done and if you are a WW II buff you have to
have this.  I give it 5 stars.  If you are a Marine, buy it
with pride.",1346284800,,319,3.661764705882353
8257350,5,B00153ZR7C,"As noted by another reviewer,this is outstanding. And a great price for the 2 disks. TMG has produced some excellent
 DVDs in the Battlefield series. also. I did think that more material on the Cactus Air Force should have been
 included. Success of the campaign depended greatly on their contributions. Some viewers might be interested
 in the fictional John Wayne movie In Harm's Way which has some correspondence with the campaign. There is
 a good presentation about the Cactus Air Force in Series 1 of Dogfights (Guadalcanal section) which are
 computer reconstructions of some of the dogfights involving the aces (includes interviews too)",1334188800,,644,5.213592233009709
8257351,3,B00153ZR7C,"This production does have some interesting facts it presents, such as how the Navy Department tackled logistic problems and ship reinforcement during the first six months of the Japan-USA war, and the fact that other carrier based raids were carried out against the Japanese in the western Pacific during the period of the Dolittle raid on Tokyo. Food poisoning our Marines and sailors came down with when they were fed spoiled chicken (green meat)during the voyage from California to New Zealand, which is disgracefull.

But there are problems. First, one of the historians they interview is given to exageration, such as statements he made regarding the Battle of the Coral Sea. He states correctly that this was the first carrier vs. carrier battle in naval history, and the first naval battle in which neither fleet's ships sighted each other from on deck. But then, as if to confirm or emphasize these points, he states that only the carriers were engaged in the combat. Well, this is just not true, neither logically nor factually. The task forces for both sides sailed with a variety of escort ships- destroyers, cruisers, supply ships, etc. These ships on both sides were attacked by opposing aircraft during the battle, and of course, the guns on all those non-carrier ships fired back. So obviously, these ships were engaged in the combat, and some of them were sunk, and they shot down their share of aircraft.

Another thing that I have become frustrated with over the years, and is apparent in this film, is the rather free use of stock footage in this production, to the point that some segments might now be labelled as 'generic footage'. For example, during the chapter in which they are recounting the Battle of Midway, (the film does provide a good background primer on events leading up to Guadalcanal) when they tell the tale of one of the Japanese airstrikes on Spruance's fleet, in the process of describing the bloody situation on board the deck of the Yorktown before she sank, they show about a thirty second loop of footage of a chaplain administering last rights to a dying American serviceman. The problem is, this bit of film is not from Yorktown, it is not from Midway, nor is it even from on board a ship, let alone is it from June 1942. I have seen this very same footage in other documentaries on the island-hopping campaign, in which it was supposed to represent Tarawa, or Peleleu, or the Philippines, and it was an Army or Marine chaplain praying over a dying Marine or Soldier. The chaplain is wearing a GI-style helmet(an M1 helmet)that US servicemen wore for most of the war, and were still wearing in Korea and Vietnam. But at Midway they were still wearing the old Brodie style helmets, adapted from the British during WWI and not replaced until sometime between Midway and Guadalcanal. (They do show seemingly true footage of the Marines on Midway during the Japanese air strikes there; they are wearing their Brodies.)

Of course, in June 1942 it is possible that some American servicemen had the new M1 helmets, while others were still waiting on their's and continued to wear the Brodies in the meantime; U.S. war material production in mid-1942 was not what it would be later in the war. By 1943 U.S. industry had not only equipped all the American military with M1 helmets but had also supplied them in great numbers to the Chinese, the Free French, the Dutch forces in exile, the Polish forces etc.

IF you can get a good deal on this DVD here, then get it. There are new surplus copies still out there, this DVD is apparently otherwise out of print. But I think A&E has some films on the same topic that are probably better.",1294272000,17,3673,4.734375
8257352,5,B00153ZR7C,"Good video, has good set up, i.e. battles before Guadalcanal. Covers all the sea battles around the island, Salvo island etc. Covers the Cactus air force and their air battles.",1280016000,11,176,4.9
