8229798,4,B000XUF6NS,"This is a good dvd. If your use to buying the wew dvd volume series(2 dbl sided dvd's), well your only getting one dvd with this one. It last about an hour,and its a good one. The hottest action is at the start, three female refs come out to the ring. Yes they are hot. One had on just body paint and they show footage of her getting decorated in bodypaint, ref stripes style. The other refs are ""top heavy"" and nice. The best match was probably April Hunter vs Black Barbie. Now, let me go on record and say I love Simply Luscious. That shortie got some attitude, that no one can adjust, yes! Anyway, Jazz did a little something and then its over. So, if you watch this one you may need to go into another dvd to get your wew fix.",1215043200,3,731,4.083333333333333
