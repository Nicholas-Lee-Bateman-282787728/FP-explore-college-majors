Yeah I didn't know that he had passed or else been under a drug overdose or something. Long story short, This is a good interesting and mostly inspirational flick on the life on the life of Robert ""Bobby"" F. Kennedy (1925-1968).

Still remains my favorite Kennedy movie of all-time. Check out ""RFK"" and ""The Kennedys"" for example.",1111622400,6,493,4.477777777777778

7845452,5,6303397042,"Brad Davis was superb as Robert Kennedy and Veronica Cartwright equally so as Ethel Kennedy.  G.D. Spreadlin was first-rate as Lyndon Johnson.  However, Cliff DeYoung was very poor casting as John F. Kennedy.  DeYound portrayed the softer side of J.F.K., but did not really show the strong side to him.  The mini-series does not go behind the scenes in reagrds to affairs and other things that we have been told.  I learned a great deal about Robert Kennedy from this and wondered what might have been in regards to this country had he lived.",1366329600,2,542,4.723404255319149
7845453,3,6303397042,"I'll be right up front, I'm not a big fan of the Kennedy's.  That being said, there is much about Bobby that I really like.  This miniseries is slow and not a very good production.  There are too many gaps in the story and key folks are left out, such as Kenny O'Donnell.  Though there are good actors in this film they seemed to be reaching to achieve their goals in performing as their roles would ask. I've watched the two major miniseries on the Kennedy's and by far this is the worst of the bunch.  I was looking forward to seeing this.",1343347200,,541,4.213592233009709
7845454,5,6303397042,"Robert Kennedy and His Times is probably the best and most true work done about RFK and who he REALLY was. I had just finished reading the book of the same title by the late Arthur M. Schlesinger, so I decided to purchase the DVD, just to see how close the movie stayed to the book. To my surprise, it was dead-on. The late Brad Davis (Midnight Express) not only captured the look and sound of RFK, he also captured the soul of the man. Many have portrayed RFK in the past, but none have done it so well. Arthur Sclesinger, s closeness with the Kennedy family paid dividends here, for many of the places it was filmed in were the ACTUAL Kennedy family sites and that lent so much to the believability of the visual story. The most interesting part of the story was of JFK and RFK'S trip with their sister to  India and Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam in the early 1950s when JFK was a junior congressman. This fact about this trip and how if solidified the brothers friendship was refreshing due to the fact that history usually ignores this part of both RFKs and JFKs lives and potential understanding of what was happening there and our eventual involvement in the future. This was released in 1978, and has not aged a bit. If you want a film that sticks to who RFK really was, this is it. It was written by a man who knew him personally and professionally, and was the ""historian"" for the Kennedy brothers, Arthur M. Schlesinger. This film stays TRUE to the book, and is WELL worth it!",1322179200,2,1493,4.409420289855072
7845455,4,6303397042,"The television miniseries ""Robert Kennedy & His Times"" has a rather daunting goal -- a thorough, intelligent biopic of the third most famous Kennedy in history. And it succeeds for the most part, due to diligent attention to detail and the performance of Brad Davis... but it's also pretty whitewashed (no Marilyn affair here!).

The story opens with Robert Kennedy meeting and marrying his wife Ethel, even as his older brother Jack rises to national prominence. When Jack is elected president, he quickly appoints Robert as the Attorney General. But he soon discovers that it's a hard job -- he ends up at loggerheads with J. Edgar Hoover, helps with the Cuban missile crisis, and struggles to help the civil rights movement even as racial tensions explode.

But just as things seem to be settling down, the Kennedy clan -- and the US -- is rocked by a string of disasters. JFK is assassinated, Robert loses much of his clout, and their younger brother Teddy is in a horrifying accident during his campaign. After a bout of depression, Robert picks up the pieces and forges ahead as the next head of the Kennedy dynasty... only for another tragedy to cut his career -- and life -- tragically short.

""Robert Kennedy & His Times"" is a wonderfully appropriate title for this movie -- it not only deals with Robert Kennedy's life, but the tumultuous era he lived in. The writers really show you the nastier issues of the day, including racial violence, the Jimmy Hoffa trial, the brewing Vietnam war and the ""spy on EVERYBODY"" mentality of J. Edgar Hoover.

But just showing those problems is not enough -- and so we see how and why Kennedy developed his opposition to these things, and just how passionate he was about them. But the movie also shows the man at the heart of the movie -- a kind young man who genuinely wants to make the world a better place. We get glimpses of Robert's love for his kids, parents, wife and particularly for his brother, and the writers take the time to develop him as he deals with the tragic losses around him.

So what is wrong with this miniseries? It's sanitized! Whitewashed! I can understand not wanting to dwell on the tabloid exploits of the Kennedy clan, but from this miniseries you would think their closets were utterly clean of skeletons, affairs, and unsavory ties.

But Brad Davis is really, really amazing as Robert Kennedy. He has the face, he has the voice, he has the accent, and he has the air of boyish earnestness that hardens into strength as he learns the ropes of politics. Veronica Cartwright is similarly perfect in her smaller role as Ethel Skakel Kennedy, and we have some nice smaller roles by G.D. Spradlin (as the insecure President Johnson), Ned Beatty, and Cliff de Young.

If you know more about JFK than about his even more tragic brother, then ""Robert Kennedy & His Times"" reveals a lot about what made the man. The whitewashing is annoying, but it's still a good series.",1297036800,2,2941,4.676982591876209
7845456,5,6303397042,"Brad Davis is probably best known for his extraordinary performance in 1978's ""Midnight Express"" (1978), a film written by Oliver Stone. However, one of the last greatest roles of Brad's career (before his untimely death from AIDS in 1991) was his convincing performance as Robert Kennedy in ""Robert Kennedy and His Times"". This mini-series originally aired on CBS in February, 1985 and received huge ratings indicating the American public still had a fascination with the Kennedy family.

 Brad's role as the would-be President was welcomed positively by critics who commented that Brad not only looked like Bobby Kennedy, but had his mannerisms and gestures perfected.

 The movie followed Robert Kennedy's life from the time he was born, to the time his brother was killed by bullets in Dallas, Texas in 1963, to when Bobby decided to run for President as he decided he was no longer going to live in his famous brother's shadows.

 An excellent made-for TV mini-series, ""Robert Kennedy and His Times"" not only features a wonderful performance by Davis, but by Jack Warden, Veronica Cartwright, Beatrice Straight, and Ned Beatty. Shannen Doherty, River Phoenix, and Jason Bateman (early in their careers) all have supporting roles.

 The mini-series originally aired as a three-parter. It comes in a two-disc set and is 315 minutes in length, comes with English subtitles, and is closed captioning.",1292976000,18,1401,5.195555555555556
7845457,4,6303397042,"Brad Davis gives an uncannily believable and realistic performance as Robert Kennedy in this sentimental but mostly accurate film that does a great deal to capture both RFK and the spirit and  political climate of the 1960's.  A great film for anyone who needs a flavor for the man, or the times in which he lived.

G.D. Spradlin puts in a strong performance as Lyndon Johnson, whom the Kennedys viewed as an illegitmate usurper in the wake of JFK's assassination -- the tension between the two camps is faithfully recreated.  Ned Beatty is passable as the Kennedy-hating J. Edgar Hoover, but Jack Warden and Cliff de Young are horribly miscast as Joe Kennedy, Sr. and JFK, respectively.  Warden frankly doesn't look the part and fails to convey the domineering influence Old Joe had over his sons until the stroke that left him partially paralyzed and speechless in late 1961.  De Young fails to put in a strong performance as John F. Kennedy, the center of Bobby's universe until Nov. 22, 1963 -- it's as if they were afraid to cast someone who might outshine Brad Davis.  That said, this is an entertaining and educational biopic, so long as the viewer understands it's not truly biography but a Hollywood spin on a very public and controversial man.  RFK's outrage at injustice, his anguish at tragedy, his philosophical and spiritual growth over his lifetime, as well his intense, often straining-at-the-leash personality are wonderfully portrayed by Davis.  One of the strongest and most memorable performances of RFK ever, matched only by John Shea in 1983's Kennedy, and Steven Culp in the more recent movie Thirteen Days.",1148947200,,1630,4.941391941391942
