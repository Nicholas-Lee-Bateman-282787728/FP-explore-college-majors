2056502,5,B00022LILQ,"Some reviewers complain about confusing dialogue in this production, but most of it is word for word from the book. This film will transport you to a magical fairy land where you will be guided by a beautiful red haired enchantress, or ... it wont. And you don't have to have ever taken LSD to appreciate it, I suppose. Not every scene works for me - notably Tweedledee and Tweedledum's too fast recitation of ""The Walrus and the Carpenter,"" barely audible over a blues guitar. Otherwise these two ""boys,"" who look like aging runaways from Clockwork Orange, deliver well. Overall the performances are charming and suitable for both children and adults. And there are luminous garden landscapes, dreamlike enclosures and mysterious halls. Kate Beckinsale as Alice is vulnerable at times, assertive at others, and always strikingly attractive. You don't have to feel guilty being attracted, since in the movie she plays the role of a young mother who has gone through the mirror in her daughter's bedroom. True, she does age regress in the process, and even cries for childlike reasons in a couple scenes. But neither role nor wardrobe make you see her as a child for very long. She is a real dream girl whose presence would make a nightmare joyous. If you like the Alice books you will probably like this film and will watch it over and over.",1131667200,20,1341,4.7844827586206895
2056503,4,B00022LILQ,"I actually thought that I would never find this on DVD. I saw a snippet of the film on television and was blown away! Finally somebody did a slightly twisted yet faithful version of the story. The casting was great too, especially Ian Holm as the White Knight who doesn't look like the Knight from the book but makes you believe he is the White Knight. Geoffrey Palmer is a great choice for the White King and I loved how the costumes at times looked vaguely Seussian.

  There are a few moments in the film (""Walrus and the Carpenter"", the Train Ride, ""Jabberwocky"" and the Finale) that are actually rather unsettling at times and might scare younger viewers, so I suggest that Parents watch this film first to gauge whether their child could watch it and not be frightened.

I wish this production team had done the previous Alice story as well. Top Notch.",1131494400,35,858,4.5519480519480515
2056504,5,B00022LILQ,"This is the best adaptation of Carroll's masterpiece I've seen yet. The cast is supurb and even though Alice is a tad older than 7 1/2, Kate Beckinsale is supurb in the role. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well. The dialogue is straight from the book and has all the sparkle and punch of the original. In my mind, this adaptation leaves the others in the dust.",1126569600,6,368,4.271428571428571
2056505,4,B00022LILQ,"Some of the complaints that this is a more drugged out version, I think are correct.  But that's good.  If you read the actual stories as Carroll wrote them they are very drug induced, or seem to be.  As for the different camera techniques, I thought they were clever and a nice variety.  I also liked the British cast.  I'm used to seeing the same old American actors in everything, that they are rather dull.  Also, the British tend to use more appropriate actors for the roles, not young and popular stars.",1125792000,13,509,4.478260869565218
2056506,4,B00022LILQ,"The movie is the closest to the book that i have found. The beginning is completly different from the book, and they cut out a couple parts. For example the lion and the unicorn scene, which is my personal favorite, did not exist in the movie. And the part with the white knight was also extremely close to the part in the book, but it was so BORING...it just makes you wait for the movie to get over, and in my mind bogs down the movie. But other than that i would recommend this to anyone who is a die hard for the Alice in Wonderland series.",1125619200,,544,4.093457943925234
2056507,3,B00022LILQ,"Alice Through the Looking Glass is a great interprataion of the book, however I was slightly disapointed with it because I was on Amazon searching for the version I remember when I was a child, all I can seem to remember was two women walking through a garden with huge dice or something of that sort on their head, I don't know what version that was, but it certainly wasn't this one.  This version is excellet though and clearly defines nonsense language.  A bit lenghtly in parts, this film is good for all ages.",1123977600,,515,4.468085106382978
2056508,5,B00022LILQ,"For the person who didn't like that it didn't make sense to them,  welcome to the concept of nonsense (""The dialogue is filled with non sequiturs"" That is Lewis Carrolls text you are commenting on not this movie READ THE BOOK!)

I give this version top marks as it is the only version ive seen that is so faithful to Lewis Carrolls text. The nonsensical situations and conversations work perfectly without any actor having to go overboard with silliness. Many versions annoy me as the actors feel that have to act as daft and 'mad, totally mad' as they can. No need! the material is weird enough. This version feels weirder as a result cos the actors play it down a bit and act as if everything is as it should be when it clearly isnt.

The Alice stories were not all happy happy bouncy silly madness. Specifically, Through the Looking Glass has a dark edge to the insanity. And no songs is quite refreshing.

Oh and read the book, there is no plot, Alice is trying to reach the final square to become queen. If this is too challanging, forget Svankmejers version and go straight to the Disney infant friendly version.",1113091200,68,1118,4.51980198019802

2056510,5,B00022LILQ,"I found this to be a wonderfull version of the continuation of lewis carrolls classic alice series.  This version unlike the others ive sceen which include the original disney animation, the 1903 silent, the 1966 bbc made for tv, and the 80's tv version of alice through the looking class, and that horrible abc version with woopy goldberg, and the jan svankmajer version alice which is by far the best interpretation ive ever sceen mixing live action with claymation and stop motion photography.  This version like the 66 black and white which is live action has the characters played by some of britishes finest actors and actresses with semi make up.  The 66 version has the strong cast instead of extremelly lavish make up draws completelly on strange indevers and with ravi shankar draws in verry psycodelic themes.  This version has also an extremelly gifted british cast wich includes kate beckinsle (van helsing, underworld) of course as alice playing a 7 year old, ian Holm (lorg of the rings as Bilbo Baging, and the fifth element as the priest)as the white knight, and sian phillips (from lynches dune as the witch with the hand box) playes the red queen.  This version also unlike others has alice in one of the most book convincing rools as she her self really falls into the dream as she talks to her self in the mirror in several occasions and becoming as insane as the rest of the cast instead of most of the other movies she dosent seem to be in the dream but an oversear not changing her character from dream to reality.  Because i don't know about you but when im in a dream i too become one of the lavish characters.  It is almost if not more insane as the 66 version drawing from the book the complete quirkyness of the characters.  Their wasn't to much digital nonscence as i thought, their are a few cheezy parts but more believable ones than not.  I didn't care for the flowers in the garden as they were merelly women in heavy make up and stupid hats.  The tweedledee and tweedledum part is interesting as they tell the story of the walrus and the carpenter, They are played by actors and little cuts of clamation versions of them self and the oysters are puppets its great.  Each character tells their stories in a beautifle poetic fashion.  Also the only other thing i didn't care for was in the other 80's tv version of alice through the looking glass is their was a jabberwocky that was constantelly interupting the happy campy mood through the mirror, as a child the jabberwocky terribied me I loved it.  This one the jabberwocky is only sceen as an (evil dead) rushing camera swirl

until the white knights story of him being slayed he apears only after he is killed and is being dragged.  Anywho please give this a chance if you are interested in another version than the campy singalong version that disney created.  Be warned that this is a comlettely insane version that draws more on the book and backwards logic and is verry dream oriented no song and dance.  may not intertain children old enough to read i feel this version is a bit more adultish but has nothing inaproprite in it.

2056521,2,B00022LILQ,"Alice Through the Looking Glass (1998-tvm). Running Time: One hour, 23 minutes (at 25 frames per second).
Directed by John Henderson. Screenplay by Nick Vivian.
Originally broadcast on Channel 4 (United Kingdom).

Based upon the second story of Lewis Carroll's (pen name) books, Alice's Adventures Through in Wonderland (1865), Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There (1871).
  His real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898).

Strange, mod version of the second story of Alice in Wonderland. Alice is an adult in this television version. I don't think this version is meant for young children to see, perhaps teenagers and adults.
  Most of the outdoor scenes are actually filmed outside. They filmed on the Isle of Man, Irish Sea.

In the cast: Kate Beckinsale, Charlotte Curley, Penelope Wilton, Geoffrey Palmer, Louise J. Taylor, Rebeeca Palmer, Sian Phillips, Ian Holm, Ian Richardson, John Tordoff, Jasper Holmes, Steve Coogan, Gary Olsen, Marc Warren, Michael Medwin, Brian Gilks, John Cashen, Desmond Barrit, Jonathan Bailey, Greg Wise.

Kate Beckinsale was pregnant at the time of filming.

Movie is in English. Option of subtitles, on or off in Spanish.  Trailer Gallery available.

2056556,5,B00022LILQ,"This is one of my favorites of all the film versions of Alice!

Believing that the writing--that is, the actual words--Lewis Carroll employs in telling this story are eminently clever and just as important as the action, I am always annoyed by film versions that stray unnecessarily from the language of the book. This version sticks quite close to the original in both  aspects, while still managing to be quite creative.

I think its very effective the way director, John Henderson, conveys some of Alice's unspoken thoughts from the book by having Kate Beckinsale speak the lines either as if to herself or to the little girl on the other side of the mirror.

Speaking of that little girl on the other side of the mirror, she's more the appropriate age of the Alice character than Kate Beckinsale, but thank goodness she didn't play the part. She's not really very appealing and doesn't seem up to the challenge. Despite Alice's age being raised from the 7 and a half years Carroll gave her, Beckinsale's performance is excellent. She is as bewildered, headstrong, kind, impatient, charming, brave, and intelligent as her creator meant her to be, but in ways that are different from, but just as good as, I'd imagined her.

Some of my other favorite portrayals were Penelope Wilton, who truly embodied the White Queen, Steve Coogan in his brief appearance as the Gnat, and Gary Olsen and Marc Warren as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. I also thought Ian Holm's performance as the White Knight quite good, though perhaps he put a bit too much melancholy and lethargy into it.

There were a few disappointments, but the only truly bothersome one was the Walrus and the Carpenter scene. I loved the crazy-music-video treatment, but the audio balance was way off, with the music nearly completely drowning out Tweedledum and Tweedledee speaking the words of the poem.

I suppose people can love both, but I suspect others who, like me, found the Disney treatment of Alice too...well...Disneyfied, will find a lot to love in this film.",1470009600,3,2028,4.877906976744186

However, even as a made for television film some of the costumes and setting seemed to be of very low quality. The acting felt flat. It was like viewing what could have been a good film, but with too low of a budget to accomplish that goal(and this is keeping in mind that it was produced in the 90s). It was hard to actually finish this film. I admit, I nodded off several times.

Secondly, you can watch this never having read the book but you must be willing to suspend disbelief because logic and reason are madness in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass.  I've loved both Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass since I was a child.  As a child I read the wildly imaginative stories, painfully, but in an amazing way, descriptive and massively enthralling.  Reading these as an adult, still the fan I always have been, I see the ridiculousness that was ingenious and original, a treasure for the thinker or the casual reader.

Now, having loved and read these over and over for 30+ years, I find I cannot bear skipping any film adaptation upon which I may stumble.  There have been horrendous attempts at acid-trip-laced tales that want to make sense of the stories, which is utterly absurd; it is more absurd than the tale it attempts to tell, sadly.  There have also been good-natured attempts to make the tales in to family fare.  And then there are those that seem sincerely interested in telling the stories accurately on film.  Some have good to offer and some fail miserably and I've grown to accept this.  But here, HERE, we have a film that embraces the madness without a need to explain it.  This is the treasure; this is a film that is true to the book.  My only complaint is that the director and writer didn't come together to portray the madness of Alice In Wonderland.

Kate Beckinsdale transcends age, even claiming to be 7 & 1/2 after she's passed through the glass, and she's believable as that innocent but imaginative young lady.  Her first person dialogue, her conversation with herself, offered just as Alice spoke to herself throughout the novels, is natural and never uncomfortable.  After Beckinsdale I have to state that Ian Holm was top notch as the white knight and played his role brilliantly.  All of the cast is wonderful and the literary characters that each of the actors portray are treated with respect for the story, never insulting the characters they embody with over-the-top antics as is too often the case in film adaptations of these books.

I greatly enjoyed the film noir moments and the varying uses of black and white, slow motion, stop motion, and beyond.  Indeed, this film carries a novel of hefty weight and the product comes off as if it's a film of lighthearted wackiness and nonsense, without the heftiness that bogs down so many attempts at making these films.  I'm thankful for stumbling across this gem of a film and it now sits atop the towering number of films that attempt to encompass the greatness that is Lewis Carroll's legacy, in my humble opinion.  Nothing will ever outdo great literature but it is very nice to stumble upon films that capture the essence of a novel I love...",1458086400,3,3012,4.711832061068702

If I remember correctly, Alice is seven and a half-years-old, but anyway, I didn't hate the idea of Kate Beckinsale playing Alice. In fact, she is one of the reasons I saw the film, and yes, she is very lovely.

But the film itself needs improvement. Some scenes need better production designs. The film is often badly edited, and its pace is strangely uneven. The film has a great cast including Steve Coogan, Ian Holm and Greg Wise, and Penelope Wilton and Sian Phillips are standout as White Queen and Red Queen, but it seems director John Henderson doesnt know when to go, and when to stop.

As far as its story is concerned, this live-action version of Through the Looking-Glass is probably the most faithful one to the original text. Interestingly, this film also contains the ""Wasp in a Wig"" episode (Wasp played by none other than Ian Richardson) that was not originally in the book.

That of course does not mean the film is great. Actually, unique as it is, the film is deeply flawed (and who can beat John Tenniel?). Still, it is an attempt worth doing.",1383782400,,1266,4.668161434977579

This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1998 production of Alice in Wonderland...
Relatively few ""pure"" productions of Lewis Carroll's sequel to Alice in Wonderland 'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' are around. Several Alice in Wonderland productions of course fold in elements from Looking Glass, most often the Tweedledum and Tweedledee passage (with the enactment of the Walrus and the Carpenter poem), as well as the White Knight passage. The Jabberwocky has also occasionally been included in the telling of the Alice in Wonderland tale, although usually not in the original poem form. And of course Walt Disney included the `Garden of live flowers' bit from Looking Glass into his 1951 version of Alice in Wonderland.

But this is only the 6th actual production of Looking Glass I've come across, and it's easily the most elaborately crafted version to date. Just to summarize, there is the 1966 made for TV version adapted as a musical which is really only tolerable if you love musicals (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass/dp/B0031REQH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice Through the Looking Glass</a>). Then there is the wonderful 1983 Broadway play which enacted an abbreviated version of both books (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-Carroll-s-Alice-in-Wonderland-Broadway-Theatre-Archive/dp/B00005QBZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (Broadway Theatre Archive)</a>). A longer running 2-part TV version was aired in 1985 with a fairly full treatment of Looking Glass that ran on the second night (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B000FSME7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). A quite forgettable (and poorly adapted) cartoon version was made in 1987 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass/dp/B000FIHN6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice Through the Looking Glass</a>). And finally there is the 1993 dance production with the Prauge Chamber Ballet that although is entitled 'Alice in Wonderland', really draws more from Looking Glass (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALICE-IN-WONDERLAND-A-Dance-Fantasy/dp/B000MRNWSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALICE IN WONDERLAND: A Dance Fantasy</a>).

This 1998 version of `Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' has twenty five year old Kate Beckinsale playing Alice. The story begins not as the book did, with little Alice playing with and disciplining her black kitty (an offspring of Alice's cat Dinah from the first book), but rather with Alice as a mother tending to her roughly seven year old daughter at bedtime by reading... wouldn't you know... Through the Looking Glass. Mom falls asleep and in her dream becomes 7  year old Alice.

The opening is actually one of the few gross departures from the book. This production not only rendered most all of the book, in my view the writer and director captured much of the *essence* of the book. This is simply the most serious attempt to bring Looking Glass to life that I've seen. With Kate Beckinsale we get not only a stunning beauty of an Alice, but one very fine acting performance. Kate is clearly a very intelligent woman and she uses her faculties to bring nuance to the role. She reacts to her bizarre environment in a most believable way.

Another notable actor in this film is Sian Phillips, who played the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother in Dune (1984). She plays the Red Queen, and does a good job of it. What else? The special effects are nearly seamless. For some reason they skipped the Lion and the Unicorn passage, but the Walrus and the Carpenter piece was done with great imagination. Although this is a made for TV movie, it is a made for *British* TV movie, and thus has not been fluffed up and dumbed down for America television as is often done to Alice TV productions. The only Looking Glass production that competes with this Kate Beckinsale version in terms of fullness and run time is the 1985 production starring Natalie Gregory. That installment however suffers from being `TVised' for an American audience. It's not at all bad, but the Kate Beckinsale version is much closer to the book.

2056682,2,B00022LILQ,"OK, I'm happy to see ""Through the Looking Glass"" get any attention at all. It too often seems overshadowed by ""Wonderland,"" even though TTLG goes way beyond in some kinds of playfulness and complexity.

I hoped for better, though. Acting is erratic, costuming (including wigs and such) goes way over the top, effects aren't very effective, and it never seems to settle on a consistent style. I wanted to like this one, but just can't.

2056687,4,B00022LILQ,"Well worth watching, at least once, for Carroll fans. I felt they made some interesting creative decisions.

Very interesting was that they included the ""Wasp in the Wig"" sequence, cut from the official publication of the book, which Martin Gardner discussed in detail in ""The Annotated Alice"".

The White Knight sequence was much too drawn out for my taste, and the solliloquy was so slow as to be boring, but I did think the ""Sitting on a Gate"" sequence which was done like an old silent film with a Keatonesque character was unique.

I absolutely love the ""Walrus and the Carpenter"" sequence which is done in a kind of ""punk/rap"" style with a combo of live action, brief interpolated nature footage of a real walrus, and brief stop-motion animation.

I also enjoyed Humpty Dumpty's dialogue and they made another interesting choice in using a full egg suit only for the initial shot and the Great Fall at the end of the sequence.

I have recently been sharing ""Alice"" films with my 5-year-old daughter (after having read the books to her) and this is one that she definitely finds boring in parts, although she loves several of the other less traditional versions. She did like recognizing the dialog which is very faithful to the book. (FYI a favorite of both  of ours (for very different reasons) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-TV-1985/dp/B000FSME7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland [TV 1985</a>] and that one includes both ""Alice's Adventures"" and ""Looking Glass"" although much less faithful to the originals.)

Bottom line is: Nice for Carroll fans (and possibly fans of all non-mainsteam films) who want to experience something unique. Skip it for young children unless they have a lot of patience, are very interested, or if you are ready to fast-forward some tedious sequences.",1279497600,2,1868,5.311864406779661

2056692,4,B00022LILQ,"This adaptation of Alices Adventures Through the Looking Glass is the closest video production to an accurate, unabridged performance of the book tales.  Not a mixed up combination of the two Classic works of literature (Alices Adventures in Wonderland is a different story), this video captured much of the essence of the tale dramatically and whimsically.  The tone is appropriate to the book and therefore more intellectual as a socio-political commentary than most productions.  While it is not the complete tale, it makes good use of the scenes it chooses to depict.  Psychodramatic impact is in good balance with the authors intent.  What it can't suggest dramatically it attempts to videographically impress upon the viewer.  Clever and artsy with eccentricity on a whole new scale. Bizarre.

2056693,5,B00022LILQ,"No, this is not 100% true to the book. Obviously not, since it starts in the present and stars an adult Alice. But it is one of the few Alices that keeps to the events of the one book, instead of blending both, and it is the only one I have seen to successfully convey the absurdism, the surrealism, the silliness, and the disturbing qualities--as well as the occasional touching moments. The movie is worth seeing if only for Ian Holm's beautifully melancholy rendition of ""A-Sitting on a Gate"" (or whatever the song is called!). Yes, the filmmakers clearly spent all their money on their cast, and not much on sets and special effects, but they supply in imagination what they lack in budget.

2056697,3,B00022LILQ,This movie was an interesting rendition of Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.  Can't say it's one that I'm going to watch again.  A bit long winded in my opinion.,1193788800,2,158,4.607142857142857
2056698,4,B00022LILQ,"This is quite an interesting version of Through the Looking Glass because its screenplay uses little else than direct book quotation.  Of course, I can only imagine how challenging pulling off such a feat can be, since Carroll had SO much stuff to say.  How to cram it all in?  Well, you can try going very, very fast.  And that's exactly what this movie does for the first 40 minutes or so.  I mean it blazes from one chapter to the next, and as a result the characters seem a bit under-established and it's tough for the viewer to know what the heck is going on.  However, the last half of the movie slows down quite a bit to an appropriate pace, and is quite enjoyable, at least to anyone who's read the book.

Another thing to consider in attempting to translate a Carroll book to film is carrying out the dialogue successfully without making the film seem too talky.  Speeding through lines DOES make the time spent on talking shorter, but I don't know if that's such a good idea.  I mean, speeding through the Walrus and the Carpenter poem completely ruined it for me.  It sounded mumbled and I couldn't even hear most of it since some rather loud background music was playing during the entire scene.

The excessive amount of incredibly witty dialogue doesn't work near as well on the screen as it does in print, but I wouldn't say this film is bad, or even average.  Heck, I was very pleased to see that it contained the Wasp in a Wig chapter, and the train scene is incredibly spooky, moreso than it is in the book.  There's no denying that this movie does a very good job with the spooky stuff, and the white queen running in super-fast motion darn sure creeped me out.  You know, odd as it is, I never felt creeped out reading a Carroll book.  I always found his works to be darn funny and thought-provoking (the good kind of provoking) at the same time.

The other is because It would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that doesn't know anything about Wonderland.  My 9 year old even got bored with this.  Kate Beackinsale plays the Mother in the beginning, and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so.  She just didn't look well in this movie, and everything looked so cheap and fake.  The story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out.  I would not recommend this.

It's done more beautifully than one could expect from a TV production (of course, it's not just TV, it's BBC).

All the acting in this movie is perfect in my opinion. Everyone fits perfectly in their roles, with a special mention of Sir Ian Holm who, at least for me, became the White Knight. His portrayal is so touching it brings me to tears everytime. Interesting trivia is that he played Lewis Carroll himself in a lovely movie called ""Dreamchild"".

Kate is wonderful in her role, and to be honest, I'd much rather have a grown woman from Britain playing Alice than an american girl trying to fake an accent.

My 7 1/2 yr-old son also enjoyed the film; he was glued to the set for the entire 86 minutes (perhaps because we read Through the Looking-Glass to him last year).  However, my 4 yr-old daughter was not interested in the least.

2056708,5,B00022LILQ,"I have to say I have always been a fan of the original book, and this movie (though outlandish) is just like the book. It has that imaginary flare with the appeal of modern twists. Like the book it is surreal and playful, with yet had a philsophical side.

Ian Holm (aka Bilbo Baggins) gives an excellent flare to my favorite poem from the book, which I was pleased to hear, ""A-Sitting on a gate."" He adds a distinct take on the poem I had never heard before.

Kate Beckinsale (Kate Beckin-saul) makes a great appearence as a grown up Alice. Though it is vague why she is Alice and not a child, to explain, she is reading to her daughter and falls into the book herself. The ending poem was magnificant with Kate's voice mingling with the child's in that wonderful English tone, in which all Alice should sound like. She made me wish that she did a reading of the book for purchase!

My only question while watching the film was, where is it filmed? One might assume UK, but sometimes they film in New Zealand..and though I lived there and know everything New Zealand I am still unsure. The one large tree towards the end of the film looking quite familar. Does anyone know?

If you have any ideas, please contact me.

Director John Henderson stays pretty much true to the original story with a modern day ""fashion flair"".  Kate Beckinsale is a beautiful Alice and her delivery of each line is exactly as most lovers of literature heard them in our heads when we first read the book!  Her many MANY wardrobe changes in the same scenes are a bit distracting, however, it's played off well and you start counting how many different things they can stick in Kates hair without giving away the joke!
