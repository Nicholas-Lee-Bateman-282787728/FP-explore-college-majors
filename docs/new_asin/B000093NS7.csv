1878605,5,B000093NS7,"This shot at one of Melville's best known stories is both a startling short film and on target as to it source.  Moved to that banal modern London that Prince Charles is always grumbling about, it turns those plain buildings and awful alleys into the sort of wierd surrealistic beauty that is food for Bartleby's unfathomable spirit.  A bold filmic choice, while this locale  does not totally explain why he ""prefers not to"" do much of anything but faceless jobs, and then only half-heartedly, it sets him and gives him gritty and explicable context.

Here an auditor rather than Melville's copyist, Bartleby is taklen in by a small firm's unfailingly decent head marvelously portrayed by Paul Schofield. The battle of wills ensues, a fable of the modern world still appropriate and telling, funny and monumentally frightful.  One nows sees that Melville here was a harbinger of Ionesco and Beckett in this relentless experiment in minimalism and ambiguity.  This film is a must see for any devotee of America's greatest author, whose facets continue to prove an unexplored goldmine.",1149292800,12,1083,5.056179775280899

7989179,5,B000093NS7,"This will never be a particularly popular film, and it's not for every taste -- not even for some admirers of Melville, to be honest. But taken on its own terms, it reveals both Melville's humanity & sense of absurdity very effectively, even though it's been updated to London circa 1970, when it was filmed. But that's the point. This proto-Kafkaesque story of human detachment, disconnection, and alienation remains as pertinent today as when it was first written -- in many ways, even more so. For those who dislike the liberties it takes with Melville's original, I do sympathize. But it's telling that any attempt to film the story always seems to update it as this version does, testifying to its enduring significance, and making it more difficult to consign its potent message to another time, safely in the past. And if it seems a bit ambiguous in retrospect, Melville himself was no stranger to the power of ambiguities. As I said, definitely not for every taste -- but for the discerning viewer, there's much to recommend & mull over afterward, if you give it a chance -- if only you would prefer to, of course!",1430006400,2,1122,4.729591836734694

Wrote up what I did or did not learn from this movie just to get the MDA completed and out of the way.  Wouldn't pay to watch this boring movie again.,1395446400,,307,4.1525423728813555

I could really sense that Bartleby's employer felt a sense of responsibility for Bartleby's welfare, although he kept saying to others that he wasn't responsible. It would be nice to have such a boss, but seriously all employers should show compassion for the well-being of their employees. There is not necessarily a need to take it as far as Bartleby's employer did though.

Although the actor who played Bartleby did well, he played the role somewhat different than Melville's written character. The actor portrayed him with more emotion, depressed, at times he even appeared to have tears welling up in his eyes, and a sad facial expression. Melville's Bartleby almost seemed void of emotion, with soulless eyes. Probably the director guided the actor's sad portrayal of Bartleby. I would have liked to have seen Bartleby portrayed as void of emotion. It would have strengthened the character and the plot.

Melville's mental hospital wasn't as nice as the hospital in the film. I suppose that's because the mental hospital's became more humane in the modern times in which the film was set. I would have liked to have seen the mental hospital in Melville's earlier era setting. It would have added more depth to the plot and empathy for the character.

Overall the film was okay but could have been great, if it didn't stray away from how Melville wrote the setting and the emotionless Bartleby.",1329609600,,1571,5.430327868852459
7989186,5,B000093NS7,"This is a great production.  Paul Scofield is fantastic and John McEnery is the epitome of Bartleby.  It's a quiet little drama, but well worth the effort.",1259539200,4,155,4.703703703703703
7989187,4,B000093NS7,"This films' product description gives a fairly accurate idea of what you're in for but what's interesting is how this movie is able to motivate itself while we watch a truly unmotivated person. Bartleby is somewhat of an odd but curiously intriguing man. At first I found him amusing when we would tell his boss he'd ""prefer not to"" do whatever is asked of him. His boss' reactions are priceless. Gradually, I become as annoyed and frustrated as his boss. We wonder: what is Bartleby's problem? Is he insane? Did he snap? He's so sincere and unemotional it is unbelievable how such a milksop of a man can create such havoc wherever he goes. John McHenry had his work cut out for him as an actor. How does an actor play a character who seems to want nothing and do nothing but simply exist? We all have to want something. What I wanted more than anything while watching this movie is to know what point it was trying to make. Is the point of ""Bartleby"" merely to demonstrate that we cannot exist by doing what we want, when we want but have very little human contact? The dilemma I feel when I watch this is trying to decide if Bartleby is insane for just wanting to live a non-violent life the way he wants or are we insane for keeping people from this freedom? The film is frustrating to watch but that's not the fault of the movie or the story, I simply don't understand its theme. However, I would recommend this film-mostly for the first rate performances but also because it was very thought-provoking. It asks a lot of it's audience however. For it to be successful you have to give it a chance and be willing to engage yourself in it's themes. I was not truly fond of this film as a whole, but I appreciate it's ambiguity.",1229126400,5,1729,4.40625
