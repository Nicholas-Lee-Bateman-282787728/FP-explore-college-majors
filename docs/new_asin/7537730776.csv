There is a false note though - despite this being a remote and mountainous place, where people frequently travel nowadays too with horse-drawn carts, there are many cell phones around. In the economy of the story (no spoilers ahead), this could matter.",1392768000,,407,4.828571428571428
7899896,5,7537730776,"I've been waiting for this movie to become available since reading about it in Sight & Sound magazine a few years back. The scenery and cinematography are so beautiful and the cast are all very convincing. But this is not a light-hearted film. Its subject matter is dark: misguided revenge. Without giving away any details of the film, I would like to say that the music and sound are both very crucial to the movement of the piece. The sounds of the various settings help to set the tone of the scene, whether or not they are amplified, and the music is at one moment peaceful and another very haunting. I believe this was Peter Strickland's first feature film and if this is any indication of his future, I would say he is someone to keep an eye out for. Quality work. The additional features are also wonderful and give a great insight into his working methods for this film and the struggles he and his crew encountered in getting past the idea stages for it. Having worked in independent film myself, I can appreciate people with a vision and their internal dilemmas, especially when they manage to see them through.",1358985600,2,1121,4.582089552238806
7899897,5,7537730776,"Katalin Varga is a shocking and disturbing movie. After having been raped by two unknown men, Katalin is pregnant from this event and fruitlessly intends to give her life a shift, but this secret will not last too long, and his husband knows the truth, his Calvary will be about to begin.

Overwhelming, harrowing, powerful but not easy to watch film. A glorious masterwork all the way through.",1295395200,,394,4.794117647058823
7899898,4,7537730776,"Katalin Varga is a film about persistence and endurance, about overcoming difficulties and setbacks, it's about having unswerving faith that you're on the right track and seeing things through to the end.  That's the case to some extent with the figure of Katalin Varga, a woman who has been turned out of her home by her husband when he discovers that the nine-year old son they have isn't his, who sets out across the Transylvanian countryside to find the men responsible for her misfortune and settle the score, but it applies more to the determination of English director Peter Strickland to go to Romania with 30,000 and make a film that is every bit as accomplished and distinctive as the masters it aspires to - Parajanov, Tarkovsky, Lynch and Bergman.

It's Bergman's Virgin Spring that comes to mind particularly in its dark tale of revenge in a rural setting that makes it feel like the period piece that was the director's original intention (budgetary constraints put paid to this), but which remains in the mythical folklore elements of storyline, as well as in the snatches of folk-songs that Katalin hauntingly sings as she crosses the beautiful landscapes of Hungarian and Romania Transylvania in a horse-drawn cart with her son on a mission of death.  The storyline might perhaps seem a little thin and melodramatic for a film with arthouse pretensions, but Strickland's film works very much in the style of Andrey Zvyagnitsev (The Return, The Banishment), quietly underpinning the thriller elements of the plot with a strong sense of characterisation that is tied-in with the very land and culture, allowing a more nuanced ambiguity about the morality of the actions to be conveyed through a wider perspective than just Katalin's.

The real strength of the film and the acknowledged influences however is in how they are employed by the director in service of the film and how he consequently makes them his own.  The cinematography is stunning, but it's more than just pretty pictures, every image conveying a specific impression and mood, while the sound design (heavily influenced by David Lynch's work on Eraserhead) is equally is effective, if not even more so.  Everything comes together in a manner that belies the budgetary difficulties and relative inexperience of the filmmakers.

The film's qualities are enhanced by a fine UK Region 2 DVD release from Artificial Eye.  The image is enhanced widescreen, and there are 2.0 and 5.1 soundtracks - the latter being essential and highly effective.  There's a full selection of extra features with a full length commentary, deleted scenes, a fine making of, and informative interviews with Strickland and director of photography, the director detailing the intentions and the long post-production difficulties, all of which only enhance one's admiration for this impressive debut feature.",1273017600,3,2861,5.135483870967742
