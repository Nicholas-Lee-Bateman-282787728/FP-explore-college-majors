1377753,5,B00004YRIT,"I had the privilege of working on the film OUT OF SEASON as a production assistant. Yet not until I saw the finished product did I really appreciate the storyline and Jeanette Buck's sensitive direction. While the film is  very much a lesbian love story, and one which boldly portrays an  interracial romance as one affected more by personality differences than  racial strife, the film is also about caring and letting go. In the  generation of AIDS caregiving, strong lesbians have often been stereotyped  as instinctive nurses to men and/or unfazed by death and loss. It is  refreshing and honest to see a video where a lesbian is shown to be a  reluctant and inept caregiver to her dying [straight] uncle, and the film  searingly shows the pain of BECOMING close to someone only to lose him.  If interracial romance, eldercare and death seem heavy topics--certainly,  they are--I can assure folks that the film's humor encompasses its lessons,  with uplifting and sexy scenes, too. We are introduced to characters who  transcend small-town limitations or loneliness because they know exactly  who they are. Their dailiness stands in marked contrast to the outsider,  Micki, whose life seems to be a series of unfinished plans and  relationships. When Micki falls for local short-order cook Roberta, their  shared lesbian identity is not an issue: their differing acceptance of  responsibility is.  The film truly offers something for everyone:  an  illustration of the challenge in caregiving; a tribute to loyalty and  dailiness in town networks;  a sizzling seduction scene; and lead  characters who are really evenly matched, though deliciously uneven in  temperament. From my perspective as an ""insider"", I can add that  the cast and crew were all a pleasure to work with: no attitude on set and  a camraderie that really shows in the final product. I can't recommend  highly enough the rewards of becoming involved with quality indendent film:  and such projects NEED WORKERS! Pass the word along to your friends that  seeing Jeanette's film is far and away the emotional experience of a  lifetime.",947462400,32,2107,5.093841642228739
1377774,1,B00004YRIT,"Not good, boring, poor acting and writing, well advertised sex scene was less than a soap opera in the afternoon...(ok 2 women that was the big difference?)
No more time to waste on this one...rent it first do not buy it until you see it once...This film will never be in season",1070928000,6,278,4.365384615384615
1377775,3,B00004YRIT,"The DVD only has two chapters. One takes up about a minute, the rest consists of the entire film.",1048204800,6,97,4.157894736842105
1377776,3,B00004YRIT,I was a little skeptical because I'd never heard of any of the actors in this movie but I'm glad I gave it a chance. This is an offbeat drama that offers many funny and touching moments. The story is a little slow but and easy to follow. The scenery on the Jersey Shore is beautiful and creates a peaceful mood for this love story. Dennis Fecteau gives a touching performance as Micki's terminally ill uncle. This is one the better lesbian films I have seen in a while.,1042761600,3,469,4.280898876404494
1377777,2,B00004YRIT,"As I actually worked on the production of this film I was genuinely surprised to find it for sale on Amazon.com  As far as I know, despite our contracts, no member of the crew was ever paid for her work on this film.
Having said that, while the script attempts to tell a genuine story of a young woman finally growing up and and older woman taking a last chance on love, the film is hampered by a lack of depth and a shallow approach to character development.",1039219200,8,459,4.215909090909091
1377778,3,B00004YRIT,"Although both are small, independent films about the gradual development of intimate relationships between two women, ""Out of Season"" is a MUCH better film than ""It's in the Water"" (though not as good as ""Chutney Popcorn"").  Deciding precisely why this is so would be an interesting exercise for aspiring movie critics.  The ""Out of Season"" DVD itself, which offers full-screen format, is quite satisfactory.",1014595200,12,408,5.359375
1377779,5,B00004YRIT,"This often overlooked film is a must-see for anyone interested in a realistic love story between women. The film has a lazy, sleepy feel to it that matches the lead character's personna as well as the town it was filmed in (Cape May, NJ, USA).
No one sleeps with men, a welcome relief from the gaggle of other films on the market that seem to refuse to acknowledge the idea that many people are Kinsey 6's.
An excellent story, loveable, honest characters, beautiful scenery.  An all-around great indie film!",1013299200,52,507,4.696629213483146
1377780,5,B00004YRIT,"It is wonderful, that we as a community are creating more movies that are of better quality.  The story and acting were very good and I loved the movie. It was very entertaining.  I wish there were more.",997747200,7,203,4.315789473684211
1377781,1,B00004YRIT,"There are several reviews listed below that speak to each end of the review spectrum regarding this film (ie - they loved it or they hated it ).
They were mostly written for the VHS version of this film.
Please see my comment # 8 as to why this is important.
My personal appraisal : Not very good.
1. Characters who ""act"" with their clothing are usually very uninteresting ( ie. she's got a leather jacket on, she must be a ""rebel"" )
2. I was bored silly.
3. Taken with a grain of salt, this could have been a great comedy along the lines of ""Showgirls"" ( ie. So Bad, It's Good ).
4. The script was lacking...big time.
5. The production values looked right on - it's an independent film but they didn't spare the film...however, the extraneous shots of absolutely nothing wear on the pacing.
6. Oh, I'm sorry, there was no pacing. The plot clunks !
7. There's a whole lot of NOTHING going on here.
8. MOST IMPORTANTLY - This is a play it or don't play it DVD. There are no CHAPTERS ! You cannot skip around without ""fast forwarding"" or ""rewinding"". A major flaw in this very exciting age of DVD special features. So...if you do buy this DVD, don't be dropping that remote, if you accidently hit stop, you're done!
I definitely cannot recommend this DVD. There are a whole lot of better films out there - more worthy of your time and money.
If this is the genre you're looking for ( Lesbian Themed Independent Films ) then check out ""Better Than Chocolate"", ""It's In The Water"", ""Show Me Love"", ""All Over Me"" or ""Bound.""

1377782,2,B00004YRIT,I bought this because the back cover stated that the end love scene was too die for or something to that effect.  Now you can read the other viewers' comments to find out what the story is about.  But this movie only kept my attention because it was a lesbian flick.  And i watch it whenever i get tired of all the straight people on television.  the story line was poor and the action was bad.  for once i want to see a lesbian film with substance.  just another low budget bad acting lesbian film you can add to the list.,991267200,23,523,4.128712871287129
7927518,5,B00004YRIT,Excellent!  Arrived before estimated time and very happy with the dvd,1495584000,,69,5.2727272727272725
7927519,5,B00004YRIT,"Their connection was the uncle. I found it to be mysteriously, romantic. You'll like it.",1486684800,,88,4.933333333333334
7927520,5,B00004YRIT,"I came upon this movie by accident. When it came to an end I didn't want it to. I cried for an hour. It has everything you could want. love, anger, death, everything. Have your crying towel in your lap. Becky Anne",1431129600,,213,4.095238095238095
7927521,5,B00004YRIT,Heartwarming and typical for a dyke to not want to admit anything sensitive.  Good movie!,1428278400,,89,4.933333333333334
7927522,5,B00004YRIT,"I love this movie. Some people who wrote reviews say it was boring, but I have watched it over and over again. It is a calm, nice, non violent love story between lesbians that deals with cancer, friendship and other issues as well. Not much sex scenes, Just one or two, but I don't not mind that. If you want a lot of sex, rent a porn movie.
My dvd was defective and other reviewers say the same thing, DO NOT BUY THE DVD, they are all defective. BUY THE VHS.
My dvd was ok for awhile, although I could not go backward or forward or skip. Then finally it would play about one fourth of the way through then just go back to the start. So, I bought the vhs and actually it had about as good a picture as the dvd. There are no extras on the dvd anyway. ( The vhs is recordable )",1418428800,,775,3.9426751592356686
7927523,2,B00004YRIT,"If you want a DVD to put you to sleep, this one is perfect.  Poor acting, silly story line and poor cinematography. I would not recommend it unless of course there were nothing else to watch.  The only thing it beats is watching paint dry or grass grow.",1370131200,,253,4.25
7927524,5,B00004YRIT,"Carol Monda stars as Micki, a restless, cynical native New Yorker. When her uncle Charlie becomes terminally ill, Micki reluctantly agrees to help take care of him. Charlie lives in the small town of Cape May, which big-city gal Micki has trouble adjusting to.

Micki happens to be a lesbian, and she's wary of getting involved in a serious relationship. She's been burned before, and she's just too foot-loose to want to settle-down anyhow. But Micki soon finds herself chasing after a very attractive women named Roberta, that she meets at the local diner. The one thing Micki has in common with the woman, is that they both look after Micki's dying uncle.

Micki sets out to seduce Roberta. But Roberta is reluctant to get involved with Micki, due to Micki's inability to form a permanent, serious relationship. Micki tries all sorts of clever ways to win Roberta over. Roberta does become attracted to Micki's roguish charm, but continues to play hard-to-get. Roberta makes it clear that if Micki wants her, it has to be a real relationship, and not just a fling. Micki has to decide if Roberta means enough to her, to let Roberta tame her wanderlust.

This film was quite down-to-earth, regarding the very human need that we all have to be loved. Carol Monda as Micki, and Joy Kelly as Roberta, really clicked on-screen as the star-crossed lovers. They played out the classic romantic dilemma of opposites attracting, then repelling. The trials and tribulations of their love affair, is something that most anyone who has been in love, can relate to.

This film is a sensitively told story, of lesbian romance between two very different woman, and their struggle to make their relationship work. Both women begin to overcome their fears about being vulnerable, once they start an on-going relationship. The film ultimately shows that no matter who a person is, they can find love, if they open their hearts and let love in. It's kind of a corny premise. Yet it also is true to the hopes most of us have, to find the one person who'll love us deeply, warts and all.",1261958400,2,2069,4.770949720670391
7927525,3,B00004YRIT,"Though the lighting and overall atmospheric quality in the movie lack a certain quality, Joy Kelly comes forward as an actor with an amazing amount of class. Her portrayal of Roberta holds a ring of truth to a quiet woman who truly knows her sexuality without the flamboyance of some of the other characters. This is an actor who deserves many more expansive roles. The other characters seem much more like caricatures. It carries a fairly simple romance plot which could have been delved into deeper and some of the characters more explored. I believe if the quality of the lighting and filming was stronger this would stand as a a fine gay film. As it stands it will be a fine television film.",1178928000,,695,4.612903225806452
7927526,3,B00004YRIT,"This was an okay movie.  Just okay, not horrible not, just okay.  I liked the camera work and Roberta and Mickey are easy on the eye.
The straight diner owner Shelly was annoying sometimes and I saw too much of her.  Roberta's best friend was interesting for the too few moments she was in the movie.  That's a character that should have been given more air time.  Not often do I see a black lesbian with straight black friends.
Mickey bordered on being a stereotype leather wearing dyke.  Heavy smoking, heavy coffee drinker ... come on, give it a break.  Knew a lot about her, and her friends. Her friends were fun.
Midway the movie takes a long nap coming to terms with Uncle Charlie's illness.  It doesn't become sad it goes to deep sleep.  It falsely moves the Mickey-Roberta relationship forward.
Bedroom scene was nice, safe and sweatless.  It did not make me want to hit the rewind button.  The movie picked up a little after that.",1081382400,18,939,4.529761904761905
7927527,1,B00004YRIT,"This film lacked storyline and acting talent...and something occured in the transfer from either film or video to DVD which added insult to injury. The story represents it self as sexy, there was no chemistry between the actors. The script was so unrealistic, I cringed during the dialogue....I didn't mind the efforts of the director of photography but the work was harmed in either editing or transfer..The movie does not flow,,,Is it hard to make a quality lesbian film? ""A Family Affair"" and ""Aimee and Jaguar"" are two of the best films to come out in the last 5 years in this genre...why don't these ""hobby"" filmakers view these better films for instant film school in how to write a screen play and direct a film...just cause one has money to make a film there are better investments than putting it behind poor filmakers...The talent is out there...This is not a fair representation of lesbian filmaking...nor a good film",1071532800,13,928,4.8427672955974845
