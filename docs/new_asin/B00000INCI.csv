1225431,5,B00000INCI,"A Woman of Substance is an excellent miniseries.  The actors are great: Jenny Seagrove as young Emma and Deborah Kerr as the older Emma were wonderful.  Liam Neeson as Blackie O'Neill was excellent as well.  The location in which the miniseries was shot was great.  It provided a great picture of the areas in which Emma lived throughout her life.

What I found most entertaining and just absolutely wonderful was the fact that this movie followed the book!  I was completely thrilled while watching this movie that it so closely followed the book.  I dislike watching a movie based on a book only to have things happen differently than the book.  That is clearly not the case in this movie.

This DVD has a few extra features including an interview with Barbara Taylor Bradford and the filmographies of the actors.  It also has an interview with Diane Baker who played Laura and was also the producer of the film. I found the interview with Barbara Taylor Bradford to be entertaining and informative.  She seems to be a wonderful lady and it was great to hear her story and her writing history.

A Woman of Substance is an excellent movie based on an excellent book.  Anyone who has read the book would love this movie.  I think anyone who wants to read the book would just as well love the movie. It is a great movie to watch again and again!",1092528000,44,1344,4.545833333333333
1225432,5,B00000INCI,"A very good and entertaining story.  Great acting by Jenny Seagrove and Deborah Kerr.
I must however, remain skeptical of how such things could actually place in conservative Victorian Britain, before WWI.
After all, in more liberal U.S., the women's lib movement didn't take place until 1960s and 1970s",1039046400,3,303,5.183673469387755
1225433,4,B00000INCI,"Everybody has some miniseries they have to watch every now and then. ""The Thornbirds"" maybe? Or perhaps it's ""The Manions of America"". For me and my sister, it's Barbara Taylor Bradford's ""A Woman of Substance"".  Emma Harte (the older version played by ""The King and I""'s Deborah Kerr)is a multimillionare and head of her own corporation. Four of her 5 children are greedy little buggers, and Emma becomes aware of a plot they've hatched to render her incompitent and declare themselves the legal heirs of her massive fortune. As Emma contemplates this, she falls asleep in her armchair, and through her dreams, we're transported back in time when young Emma (Jenny Seagrove) is a scullery maid for the Fairley family in their posh mansion. Emma meets Blackie O'Neal (played by the yummy Liam Neeson, who alone is worth watching this)and strikes up a lifelong friendship with him. Blackie is the first person to help Emma see that she, too, can be the head of her own fortune with careful planning and saving. Meanwhile, Emma falls in love with Edwin, the youngest Fairely son, and he loves her as well. When Emma becomes pregnant with Edwin's child, however, he withdraws and offers no support. So, Emma packs her bags and, with Blackie's help, finds a woman to stay with until her baby is born. This is just the first in a series of difficult events that begin to shape the woman Emma is to become. Her hatred for the Fairley family evolves into a lifelong goal to ruin them. She eventually marries a man named Joe and opens her first store (in which she is confronted by Adam Fairley, Edwins bully older brother, who, unsuccessfully, attempts to rape her. It is here that we first hear Emma's designs: ""Here this now"", she says to Adam, ""I mean to ruin you...the whole Fairley family.""). When Joe is killed in the war, Emma plunges herself in her stores, now a successful chain, but tends to neglect her children. Through it all, Emma survives- from losing her parents, to watching her brother have his leg amputated after a war injury, to meeting and losing the love of her life, Paul McGill (played by a very tan Barry Bostwick of ""Spin City"", who is meant to be Australian, but could have used some help w/ that poor on again/off again accent). Through it all, Emma conquers her enemies and her demons, sometimes at the expense of others. But, as she says, the secret of life is ""to endure"", and she does. It's a bit cheesy, but I fall for it every time. The book is wonderful, too, but VERY LONG. This miniseries is a decent adaptation from novel to screenplay. Also check out the sequel ""Hold the Dream"".",987638400,62,2612,4.6414686825053995
1225434,5,B00000INCI,"The protrayal of Emma Harte in the movie A Woman of Substance, shows the viewer the struggle of a young teenage girl and the trials of growing up, the events of struggling to make a stand as a young business woman and mother and the endurance over the years to the become the pinnacle of greatness.  This was an excellent movie.  It helped me regain inner strength that my trials and struggles can be conquered.  The only thing I wish was brought out more, was the different ages Emma was throughout the movie.  It would help the viewer know at what age Emma was at during different segments of her life.",969494400,5,604,4.414414414414415

I watched the first episode but my elation came crashing down when I realized that I would have to pay to watch the rest of the series. You have some lousey movies (plenty, actaully) that I can watch in their entirety, for free. I am so far, disappointed in Amazon, concerning,their FREE veiwing.",1467158400,4,449,4.357142857142857

1225560,1,B00000INCI,"As good as the book was, this could not possibly be worse.  The hair colors were wrong, we all know that the jewels were EMERALDS and not sapphires, Emma had green eyes, not blue, Blackie gave her the jeweled bow years before he gave it to her in the movie, the acting was bad except of course for Blackie.  It is as if those who made the movie went out of their way not to follow the prime elements of the book!  Gerald, for instance, was supposed to be grossly fat. Looks like they just gave him a little pot belly and his collar was way too fat.  I rolled my eyes so many, many times because I kept hoping it would get better, but it only got worse.  Don't waste your money or you time on this miniseries.  Just get the books and enjoy them.  I'd almost go so far as to say disgusting.",1443312000,2,788,4.04516129032258

1225607,5,B00000INCI,"I don't usually go for the ""Women's Literature"" category or read romance novels -- except when the romance is part of a juicy mystery story.  So I did not read Barbara Taylor Bradford's trilogy on which is set is based.

I really liked the performances and the story in this set of films.  As often happens, the first two are the best and the third is lacking in story -- seems contrived, as if Ms Taylor ran out of stuff to say and just used a formula of the bad guys versus the heirs, with the heirs triumphing in the end.

Jenny Seagrove does a great job, especially, since she is in almost every scene in the first film.

I might not have watched this except that it was promoted as starring Deborah Kerr as Emma Hart, and I always liked her performances.  It turns out her part in the film is very minimal -- starts out with her as an older person, then she goes into flashback mode with Jenny Seagrove playing Emma for the rest of the story.",1417219200,,947,4.233333333333333

1225715,2,B00000INCI,Acting wasn't that good. Story line is good. The main actress is by far the best part of this one.,1408752000,,98,3.95
1225716,2,B00000INCI,"I read the slew of rave reviews, and based on these, I watched.  What a letdown.  In the interest of possibly sparing someone with tastes similar to my own the same fate, I feel compelled to offer a dissenting opinion.  I appreciate the fact that readers (myself included) imbue films with elements they loved from a book.  Unfortunately, I hadn't read the book.  And, others liked the rags to riches aspect of the tale (as did I early on), but it wasn't enough to sustain me.  This review contains ***BIG SPOILERS, INVOLVING PLOT & ENDING***

I can deal with lousy production values, graininess, cheesy music.  For me, content and character development are paramount.  My main problem is with the ultimate outcomes, the overall arc of the story.  I found it moderately interesting until Barry Bostwick made his appearance.  Although, I had been waiting with GROWING impatience for the story to take a more positive turn, since it was decidedly one-note- i.e., Emma's ambition overshadowing everything else, resulting in the neglect of her children, her loving husband, everything, in the pursuit of money and vengeance.  Something good is BOUND to happen at some point, I thought.  But NO.

I like Barry Bostwick (so good in so many things), so I was waiting for him to appear.  I was flabbergasted by his 3rd rate performance.  His over-the-top acting careened this into the realms of Edward D. Wood Jr. territory.  His accent, when he affected it, was appalling, and much of the time it disappeared entirely.  His limp was ungainly, and CHANGED from scene to scene.  Their lovesick gazes at each other were like something from a Saturday Night Live skit.  The love scenes were so incongruous, over the top- laughable.  Their kisses were contorted, so exaggerated I was embarrassed for them.  I feared he would break her neck with the force of them.  And, suddenly this woman with iron will who's shown nary a hint of passion or weakness, acts like a schoolgirl.  Then, he disappears- and she, brilliant and assertive business titan that she is, doesn't pick up the phone and call him, make inquiries, hire a detective???  She'd done ALL these things in the past.  The plot from this point on became more and more absurd, made NO sense.  Awful.

There were countless dangling threads.  Just ONE example- she promises Diane Baker's character to look after her infant son.  Then we hear virtually nothing more about him.

I watched this in one sitting, and although I liked the one fact that Emma became a success, there was so much that was negative, and so little that was positive, I found it a drag.  She ""endured"".  So what?  I took no pleasure in her exacting revenge on the Fairleys.  I took no pleasure in her thwarting her unloving children's plan to topple her empire.  There's one half-hearted line towards the end, she says something like ""Perhaps I'm to blame for their lack of character,"" or words to that effect.  I'll say!  But Blackie responds with something like: ""No, people are responsible for their own development.""  Really?  That's ripe for debate.

Obviously I found this a waste of time, that irked me.  But I must say, I stuck with it largely due to the phenomenal acting (except for Bostwick), which overshadowed the tedious and negative storyline.  Jenny Seagrove (except in her scenes with Bostwick), Liam Neeson, Deborah Kerr, nearly everyone was great (especially Diane Baker, phenomenal in every scene she was in, what talent).  This reminded me of a similar but for me, far more satisfying and inspiring story,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dwelling-Place/dp/B004TO62F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dwelling Place</a>&nbsp;by Catherine Cookson (the book, I've yet to see a film adaptation of it).  Though not without flaws (WAY too much detail in the writing, and highly improbable), the heroine also rises from poverty to prominence, AND comes to terms with her past in ways that are healing for all concerned.  And it has a very satisfying ending.

If attaining financial success and/or exacting revenge on those who've harmed you, or cautionary tales related thereto are themes that float your boat, you may like this.  If, like me, you long for more than that (e.g., self-discovery, personal growth, righting wrongs), you won't.  I found this a story with little substance.  There were likely elements of the book that didn't make it into the mini-series, which readers could interject.  Hopefully these reviews will afford enough info for you to determine if this is just your cup of tea, or potentially a waste of precious time.  Cheers!",1408752000,,4627,5.052910052910053

1225983,4,B00000INCI,Enjoyed this mini-series. The turn of the century was perfect for showing the difficulties of women working and owning businesses. Sometimes I felt the plot was all over the place and I wish some parts of the story were explained further. (Did Edwina ever find out who her real father was?)

1226013,4,B00000INCI,I enjoyed watching this mini-series.  My only objection would be that it seemed large parts of her life were chopped out or passed over and it didn't evolve from one to the next very smoothly.  It certainly had some good lessons to learn from what choices she made in her life.,1402358400,,277,4.411764705882353

1226035,5,B00000INCI,"A well told story and wonderfully performed by Jenny Seagrove (and later Deborah Kerr) at the turn of the twentieth century of a beautiful, intelligent, young woman in service to a family of the British upper class who falls in love with one of the sons, who abandons her after she gets pregnant, which makes her determined to make it on her own.  In three parts, the story takes her through her 80s when she brilliantly outwits her sons who are trying to take over the family business.  Also starring  a young Liam Neeson who plays her lifelong friend throughout her ups and downs, and Barry Bostwick, the Aussie in uniform, who sweeps her off her feet, but war and other complications seem destined to keep them apart.",1401926400,,720,4.609375

1226037,5,B00000INCI,"This movie was truly entertaining!  It was a good old 'you can make it if you try' tale of persistence against the odds.

Our heroine had all the cards stacked against her, but prevailed through grit and determination.
I was inspired by her belief in her own ability; not so much her insatiable desire for more money, and power, driven by the need for revenge. Her 'redemption' through forgiveness of the family who had so badly damaged her, along with her understanding that the friends in her life had been a large part of her success, made the story complete.

All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable film. Both Jenny Seagrove and Deborah Kerr (wow, it was great seeing her guest appearance) made the character 'credible at all stages of her life'.  Kerr's summation, ""endure"" was a pearl.

Sooo, if you think times are tough, watch this. . .you'll probably come away with a new perspective. . and a  reminder that things could always be worse. . .I know I did!

Best, Lynn W.

1226065,2,B00000INCI,I have never read any of Barbara Taylor Bradford's novels and now I know why.  She should be writing scripts for soap operas. The story is the predictable servant girl becomes millionaire. All this accomplished by the most unlikely coincidences. Just the right amount of men and babies in her life with a convenient invisible  cousin to palm the baby off on while she makes her fortune. About as far from real life as one can get but probably good for those who still believe in Cinderella.,1400371200,,490,4.620689655172414

Looks like a severely brain damaged drunk falling asleep with a bad head cold. Still, he gets the only good sex scenes. And his body in '85 was a nice view.

1226321,4,B00000INCI,"NOTE: A few but somewhat vague ""spoilers"" in this commentary

This mini-series is true to B.T.B.'s books and is very typical romance TV production. What does set it a bit above the rest is veteran actress Deborah Kerr's performance as the older character of Emma Harte (who is the central figure in series). Kerr always brought a bit of class and integrity to the projects she starred in and this is no exception.

Jenny Seagrove does a fairly good job of portraying the younger Emma through most of the series, and we see her story through flashbacks that Deborah Kerr has looking back on her life; where she goes from being an overworked housemaid who is ultimately betrayed by one of the family brothers who she falls in love with, to her lifelong obsession with becoming rich enough to exact revenge on that family - which she does as she ends up a rich department store magnate who acquires many homes, property, and other forms of wealth.

This is formula but it's still entertaining and there are some good and not-so-good appearances by other actors who went on to become more well known. Liam Neeson plays ""Blackie,"" a true and blue friend throughout Emma's life and does a great job - of course he's gone on to become an outstanding actor and major player in the movies. On the other hand, Barry Bostwick (who looks great with his tan and vivid blue eyes) plays the Aussie that Emma falls in love with but when he's actually remembering to attempt an Aussie accent - it's quite bad and half the time he just forgets the accent altogether.

Other lesser known actors do quite a good job for this type of series and all-in-all, it's worth the time if you like both romantic dramas and period pieces. There's some lovely scenery in Wales and the series doesn't slow down or drag as there's a lot to cover even in the three (approximately 1 1/2 hour segments).

I plan to watch the sequel, ""Hold The Dream"" in which both Kerr and Seagrove return in the major character roles even though the reviews on it aren't as good as they are for this first segment of the series, just to see how it plays out in the 1980s.

This series is almost 30 years old so the cinematography and sound isn't as good as series made more recently but again, it's definitely worth watching for those of us who love romance, drama, and period pieces!",1391731200,,2331,4.524940617577197

1226364,5,B00000INCI,I read this book in the 80's and it was very inspiring. I was happy to discover this series recently. I don't remember her being so focused on money but I fell in love with her character.wish there had been some happiness for her.,1390867200,,230,4.25
1226365,1,B00000INCI,"Started out slow, continued slow; so I quit watching it before the first episode was over.  I like Deborah Kerr and was disappointed that her talent was wasted in this.",1390867200,,168,4.6

1226369,5,B00000INCI,"I loved this mini-series! Although the book has more detail, the mini-series was very good. I would recommend this to those who like sagas.",1390435200,,139,4.833333333333333
1226370,5,B00000INCI,I enjoyed this movie because of the clean storyline.  Barbara Taylor Bradford writes some of the best novels.  It was wonderful to see the book come to life.,1390348800,,157,4.571428571428571
1226371,5,B00000INCI,"The acting is wonderful, and in spite of some filming flaws related to the era in which this series was made, it is delightful. Young Emma Harte is incredible.  It starts a bit slow, but the development of her character is amazing.  There's also a very young Liam Neeson who plays the role of Blackie. Fun to watch.",1389830400,,315,4.413793103448276

1226373,5,B00000INCI,"I really loved this show when it was on TV mini-series.  I have also read the book.  I attempted to watch it through Amazon again, but because it had 'no' close caption and I am mostly deaf, I was only able to enjoy it because of seeing it before and reading the book.  It is worth your time to view this remarkly production if you have good hearing.",1389744000,,350,4.117647058823529
1226394,3,B00000INCI,"Typical of Bradford.  Good story with characters that are believable for the most part.

1226395,5,B00000INCI,"I am really into period pieces.  I love to see period piece outfits, but that doesn't determine my rating on movies or shows.  This particular mini-series was filmed back in the 80s (though it really looks like the 70s), so don't expect it to be HD quality (which I don't mind if it is good).
This mini-series was a wonderful story.  Don't let the beginning of it fool you.  It starts in a more recent setting, then later in the mini-series, it will go back in time to when it all began.
If you like watching anything that has to do with strong, independent women who rise from obstacles, and that also has romance, drama, and a great turning point at the end of it all--then this is a great choice!",1389571200,,699,4.312977099236641
1226396,3,B00000INCI,"I remember watching this on TV quite a while ago.  Some of the acting was good, and some of it, well, you know, not so good.  It was good to see it again, even the ""not so good"" parts.",1389484800,,184,3.6923076923076925

1226398,5,B00000INCI,"Loved the book, loved the TV show, would recommend highly to anyone who enjoys great acting and a wonderful story.  I just cannot understand however why I am unable to watch the sequels Hold the Dream and To Be the Best. Your website is not allowing me to play them.  They are there, just no arrows to click on to watch.",1389398400,,320,4.229508196721311
1226399,5,B00000INCI,I was surprised how closely the series followed the book.  I only wish less time was spent on the younger years and more time spent in later life especially when she found her true love.,1389398400,,186,4.314285714285714
1226400,3,B00000INCI,I enjoyed this adaptation of a Barbara Taylor Bradford novel and would recommend it to those who like historical drama.  It was fun to see a young Liam Neeson and Miranda Richardson in minor roles.,1389312000,,197,4.628571428571429
1226401,4,B00000INCI,Love this movie. They did a great job of converting it from the book. If you like older movies this is a good one.,1389312000,,114,3.7916666666666665

1226415,5,B00000INCI,"following a whole life time is a project and it was done great, as all the characters fit in their proper places! Finding just the right person to act the part of the younger person is a chore but they hit it spot on.",1389139200,,217,3.9545454545454546
1226416,4,B00000INCI,"It follows the book fairly well,  I liked the actors and thought it was very British,  You had to admire Emma Harte; she fixed her mind on her goals and never gave up.",1389139200,,167,4.03030303030303

1226418,4,B00000INCI,This is an engaging series that is hard to stop watching.  The details of her business success are frustratingly invisible.  Plan to read the book now.,1389139200,,151,4.769230769230769
1226419,4,B00000INCI,"Just watched the first installment and it hooked me for sure.  It is kind of weird seeing all these people in ""Downton Abby"".  Guess there are only so many sets available to film.  I like the story and will be watching the rest of the series",1389052800,,241,4.195652173913044

1226421,3,B00000INCI,"I enjoyed watching this film, but it did not really hold my interest.  Since I had chosen to watch it, I had to make myself finish the program.  I would not recommend this for everyone to watch, but I can see people would be interested in this period film.",1388966400,,256,4.204081632653061

1226449,3,B00000INCI,Having read the book prior to seeing the film probably affected my rating.  Movie was shallow on the story line as in the book.,1388707200,,127,4.291666666666667

actual time of the story in England.",1388620800,,164,4.4
1226451,5,B00000INCI,"I had read these books years ago when they were first published.  My friends and I shared and passed the trilogy around and talked many times about getting together and having a video/movie marathon.  Life got in the way with work and children, so I was thrilled to find these movies still available.  Thirty years plus have passed and I still enjoyed watching this series.  By todays standards these would be considered outdated maybe, but they still were enchanting and worth the time invested to enjoy the rediscovery of this story.",1388620800,,535,4.846153846153846
1226452,4,B00000INCI,I read the book many years ago and was pleased to see the movie listed. I thought it was worth watching but the book stirred my emotions more. I guess that's because imagination is more powerful than the eye. I felt the movie never really touched on the depth of the friendship Emma Harte had with Blackie. Other than that I was entertained. I would watch again.,1388534400,,362,4.417910447761194
1226453,5,B00000INCI,Great story depicting a young woman of common stature striving to rise above her status position in life. A very strong female lead.,1388102400,,132,4.782608695652174

1226508,5,B00000INCI,"The book was great when I read it 20 years ago. In fact I used the heroine's strength of character as support when working towards my own personal goals. This production was almost a mirror image of the book.  With Jenny Seagrove as Emma Hart it was excellent. I couldn't have asked for better. However, I was surprised to find that the mini-series was done in 1984. I had no idea that I could have enjoyed this production well before now.",1385856000,,439,4.419753086419753

1226531,4,B00000INCI,"I enjoyed most of the mini-series, except when Barry Bostwick appeared.  His Australian accent was terrible.  I kept thinking how could they not know his accent was awful, but the other actors were able to ignore it and carried on, so I stayed with it too. But the whole series change from a excellently performed (except for the awkward love scenes) British mini-series to a bad American TV romance movie.after his appearance.  He should have just played an American, instead of an Australian.",1385337600,,494,4.927710843373494

1226539,3,B00000INCI,"I first read Barbara Taylor Bradford's novel ""A Woman of Substance"" not long after it was published in 1979. It's a sweeping story of a young kitchen maid, Emma Harte, in the service of local gentry in Yorkshire who rises above her humble beginnings to become the head of a multinational business enterprise. In the 1984 miniseries, available on Amazon Instant Video, Emma Harte is beautifully portrayed by British actress Jenny Seagrove as a young woman and by Deborah Kerr in her later years. The script seems to accurately follow the book. However, it would take much more than a three-part miniseries to capture Bradford's sweeping and intricate saga. Since I had read the book, I was able to fill in a lot of the blanks and explain the ""back story"" to my wife, who had not read it. Still, it was a pleasure to relive this amazing story.",1384387200,,841,4.651006711409396

1226611,5,B00000INCI,The classic chick flick done in a period piece. It grabs you in from the beginning to the end. Highly entertaining as you become lost in this woman's challenges in life and love. Don't miss it!,1381536000,,193,4.388888888888889
1226612,3,B00000INCI,"This series isn't amazing but it is interesting enough and I like Deborah Kerr so I will finish it.  The production value wasn't high when this was made, and it really looks a bit dated now, but the storyline is still of some interest to me.  There are many flashbacks that starts to build the woman's tale in her youth, and slowly is revealing the plotline of her golden years present dilemma - her own sons plotting a takeover of the company she built over a lifetime.",1381363200,,470,4.390804597701149

was great.",1381104000,,122,4.545454545454546
1226615,5,B00000INCI,I love stories about woman and determination to succeed.  The era that this takes place is one of my favorite times. So many changes in industrial revolution took place then. Its all woven into this series. I couldn't wait watch each part if the series!,1380499200,,253,4.622222222222222
1226616,3,B00000INCI,"I read the novel many years ago and had an idea, a vision, of what Emma Hart was like.  I thought she was a beautiful woman with inner strength and a bit sassy.  I found the move disappointing.  The character was weaker in spirit and not quite what I had envisioned.",1380412800,,266,4.176470588235294
1226617,3,B00000INCI,"Loved the book, but the movie is a really dated 1980s production.  It is just like an overly dramatic soap opera.",1380412800,,113,4.380952380952381

1226630,5,B00000INCI,I loved this series!  Not sure how I could have missed it in the past.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes stories of strong women!  Well acted!  Five stars from me!,1379462400,,171,4.090909090909091

1226632,3,B00000INCI,"Late work of some well known actors (Debra Kerr) and early work by others (Liam Niesom).  I was looking forward to watching the sequel, Hold the Dream, when Amazon temporarily made TV shows unavailable for a few hours and when they became available again Hold the Dream had been removed from Prime options.  Very disappointing.",1378771200,,327,4.927272727272728
1226633,5,B00000INCI,"This film is a superb rendition of  Barbara Taylor Bradford's timeless novel of a bright and gutsy working class girl who pulled herself up by her own bootstraps to lofty heights.  The screenplay was excellent, as was the directing, casting, and acting.",1378339200,,253,5.0

a happy ending it takes quite awhile to get there and there
are surprises along the way. (Even my wife enjoyed it ;-)",1377734400,,179,4.294117647058823
1226638,5,B00000INCI,I had seen this years ago on VHS tape and then saw it on Amazon as a Prime Video.  To pay $4.99 each for the 3 series--I don't think I would have watched it.  Anyone that enjoys this type of Miniseries and pays for a prime membership this is well worth it because it's a great movie.  There are 2 more in this series #1 HOLD THE DREAM  and #2  TO BE THE BEST  both these will expire in 9 days from 8/25 and again there are 2 in each series and possibly $4.99 each.  If you enjoy stories like Downton Abbey this is a little bit similar but not exactly--please take the time to watch them they are great shows that originated from Barbara Taylor Bradford.  She has several books that follow the series but to my knowledge this is after the true monarch of the show Emma Harte has passed away.,1377475200,,790,4.117647058823529
1226639,3,B00000INCI,And very predictable. The acting was not very good and I found myself wondering off thinking. Only watched about an hour of it and turned it off.,1377388800,,145,4.407407407407407
1226670,5,B00000INCI,Only have watched the first episode of season one but I really enjoyed it. The story of a  woman who comes from little means and the journey she takes to ultimately head up a business empire. Good story line and likeable characters,1377302400,,231,4.5
1226671,5,B00000INCI,It was a very good mini series and can't wait to see the next one. Going to watch it this weekend.,1376956800,,98,3.7142857142857144
1226672,5,B00000INCI,"I read the book many many years ago but to sum it up, it's a story of wealth, power and romance; A story of. how a young woman from a poor family, worked for the notoriously rich Farley family. She fell in love with one of the Farley sons who refused to marry her.when she was pregnant. She moved to Leeds and found work with a family whom she remained close to and develped a life time friendship with Blackie, one of the sons. She pulled herself up by the bootstraps and with the help of this family went on to open many elegant department stores. The book follows her family life and the generations to follow, along with her good friend Blackie who is always in her life. I enjoyed both the book and the movie; the book going into detail and the movie with seans of the city and lovely actress, Paula, the granddaughter who is so much like her grandmother. I would recommend this book and movie to anyone who enjoys watching a family grow through generations.",1376956800,,963,4.355555555555555
1226673,5,B00000INCI,a great chick flick. Full of a life of a woman downtrodden and how she worked herself into a grand life,1376956800,,103,3.9523809523809526
1226674,5,B00000INCI,"Enjoyed book as well as the screen adaptation. Casting met character descriptions. If you like this era, a satisfying viewing is in store for you.",1376784000,,146,4.88
1226675,3,B00000INCI,"The flashbacks were interesting. The main character was interesting. Jennifer Seagrove and Deborah Kerr were very good.
But why end the story just when she is in dire straits? (And then begin the sequel without ever showing how she managed to to succeed in spite of these odds?)",1376524800,,278,4.8125
1226676,5,B00000INCI,I missed this when it first came out on free TV so I had to finally see this.....glad i did....,1376265600,,95,3.8
1226677,5,B00000INCI,This is a movie to give determination to women everywhere. It shows you can come from nothing and get everything out of life you want.,1376179200,,134,4.4
1226678,5,B00000INCI,The characters and the story were very good. You were eager for the next part. Avery enjoyable period film. xxxx,1375660800,,112,4.65
1226679,5,B00000INCI,Who knew anything good came out of the 80's in mini series. I didn't care for many of them but this one is great and to me its all due to the main actress Jenny Seagrove. WHERE IS SHE NOW??? she needs to be used more. What a fabulous actress. anyone think she looks ALOT like Elizabeth Montgomery??,1375574400,,298,4.155172413793103
1226720,4,B00000INCI,"Very well written and well acted.  Explores the dilemma of class, honor, ability, and accountability.  What do you sacrifice to win?",1375228800,,132,5.238095238095238
1226721,5,B00000INCI,I have read the complete series by Barbara Taylor Bradford about Emma Harte.  This is the first in the series and I love it.  The move followed the book quite nicely.,1375142400,,166,4.32258064516129
1226722,5,B00000INCI,I first read this book years ago and loved how the central character overcame her past and became successful.  I love stories of generations of families that have succeeded despite the odds.,1374624000,,190,4.9375
1226723,3,B00000INCI,This is an inspiring story about a woman working through the many hardships of her life to become a success in a man's world---it is also a tear-jerker!,1374624000,,152,4.464285714285714
1226724,3,B00000INCI,acting too soap opry for my tastes.  liked story line just not the actors except for Ms Kerr. They all were too stilted for my tastes.,1374451200,,134,4.153846153846154
1226725,5,B00000INCI,This is a timeless classic love story. The characters are realistic and come to life as you watch their lives unfold. I recommend this to women and men alike who appreciate a good story.,1373932800,,186,4.5
1226726,4,B00000INCI,"I question the title of this movie, because the so called heroine was motivated by revenge.  All in all, it shows how we as human beings are flawed in our character no matter our station in life.  All in all I enjoyed it, because it also shows that because life doesn't always turn out the way you think it should because of mistakes you have made;  with God's help you can rise above your beginnings and still achieve your goals.",1373328000,,430,4.35
1226727,5,B00000INCI,"I first saw ""A Woman of Substance"" when it was originally broadcast in the US back in the 1980s.  I was much younger then (early 20s) and I think I was a bit in love with the Emma Harte character.  When I saw the series was available on Amazon Prime I decided to watch it again.  I'm much older (and wiser?) now and watched it from a different point of view.

I now have a much better appreciation for the struggles Emma endured to become successful.  I also recognized, this time around, how much of an influence her feelings toward the Farley family drove her ambition.  Her actions at times seem almost Captain Ahab-like with the Farleys assuming the role of the white whale.  Emma is much more subtle than Ahab, but I would say her obsession is still there.

I've not read Bradford's book of the same name so I can't comment about how well the series follows it; however, I have put it on my list of books to read.

I would recommend the series to people without hesitation.  It lacks (thankfully) the gratuitous sex, violence and profanity we have all become so used to in more recent made-for-TV productions.

Over the past 30 years or so, my own life has taken some of the same forks in the road as Emma's and so this viewing triggered a lot of nostalgia for me.  I suppose I'm still a little in love with her...",1373328000,,1319,4.338775510204082
1226728,4,B00000INCI,I like to watch old TV dramas and this one fits the bill. I like that the story is about hard work and determination. I absolutely loved seeing Liam Neeson in his role.,1372982400,,168,4.121212121212121
1226729,5,B00000INCI,This show is very captivating . It makes you want to see what is going to happen next. The acting and the writing is great! I would recommend it to all.,1372636800,,152,3.935483870967742

1226762,2,B00000INCI,"The Story line has great potential.
Although filmed in the 1980's cinematography is poor.
The acting in general is week.
The story takes great leaps in time with put a sense of clousure or temporary clousure between events.",1371945600,,223,4.894736842105263
1226763,5,B00000INCI,Considering the age of the movie the quality was pretty good and the movie itself was soap opera entertainment at its best.  Wonderful to see Deborah Kerr in this role.,1371686400,,168,4.6

1226765,4,B00000INCI,"I read this book years ago, and when I saw the movie on Amazon prime, I was interested to see it.  It was a good story, and the movie was very true to the book. However, after watching almost everything in HD, it was a little off-putting to watch it in yesterday's technology, but having said that, it was still worth seeing.",1371081600,,325,4.241935483870968

1226767,2,B00000INCI,"This series really seems stilted and dated. Maybe it was good back in the day but after all the excellent British movies and TV we've seen since this one was made, this is dated and dull and poorly produced. I didn't finish it.",1371081600,,227,4.3023255813953485

1226821,4,B00000INCI,"This series struck me as being real and intriguing. I enjoyed watching something that wasn't all puppies and kitty cats.

1226826,5,B00000INCI,Sort of reminds me of people I know.....too involved in work to enjoy family.  It was free on Amazon Prime.,1369526400,,107,4.35
1226827,3,B00000INCI,"Lady Hamilton, Emma Hart, was the mistress of Lord Nelson. Interesting recycle of name. Bradford is a Brit after all and knows her history. The ""enlightened"" ""modern"" character of Emma Harte is perhaps a re-imagination of what the real Emma Hart could have done with her life had she not danced naked on tables as a young woman. No moral judgement here, but it's an interesting jumping off point for the novel.",1368921600,,410,4.708333333333333

1226867,4,B00000INCI,"I enjoyed Deborah Kerr especially, seeing her acting as such a young woman.  Since I am soon to travel to Leeds and Yorkshire, it was interesting to see the historical development of that area to give a context for seeing it now.  The plot was a little too predictable from today's perspective, but well acted and the focus on the main character as an early feminist was interesting.

Film quality was not what we are used to now, but that was ok.",1367625600,,447,4.426829268292683
1226868,4,B00000INCI,"The plot of a woman in the early 20th century struggling against the presumptuousness of men is highly relevant for what women still face.  Overcoming male barriers by striking out on her own in the business world is what is happening with more and more women.  The viewer can't help but cheer her on.

Aside from that, overlooking the unevenness of the acting makes this movie definitely recommendable!",1367452800,,403,4.897058823529412

Loved seeing Liam Neeson in what may have been one of his very early roles. He was so young. A young Barry Bostwick was a pleasant surprise and I really enjoyed this first installment in the  trilogy most of all.,1366416000,,325,4.327868852459017
1226875,3,B00000INCI,"I think this book adaptation could be done better, the story line is interesting but the acting and the surroundings of the scenes are not believable to me.  One thing that bothered me was in the big castle home the wife of the Lord had her own room (which at the time was normal) but it was VERY small and the furnishings were not adequate for a wealthy person of high society.  There were other things...but everyone to their own taste.  I have not completed the first story, but will persevere through the trilogy.",1366156800,,517,4.4787234042553195

I found the production sort of dated, not as smooth as the latest period dramas, but the story sucked me in and I watched all three segments in one evening.  This was originally presented as a mini-series back in the mid 80's and I didn't watch it back then.  In some sections, time seemed to fly past to quickly.  I think if this were redone, it would fill up a complete season, instead of three episodes.",1365465600,,508,4.372340425531915

1226905,1,B00000INCI,I just couldn't get into this film.  It's very old - not that that's usually a problem - but it was distracting.  The dialog was stilted and the acting was just fair.  Don't bother.,1364860800,,181,4.264705882352941

Is it the best thing I've ever watched? No, but it was deliciously campy. I enjoyed watching the character through many decades deal with the struggles of being a female in business and balancing work-life responsibilities. Did I mention a young Liam Neeson is in this?

If you are running out of period pieces on Amazon Instant Video (aren't we all?), I recommend you give this a try.",1363219200,,488,4.47191011235955

1226945,4,B00000INCI,"I must admit that I was initially a bit of a skeptic as to the quality of the series - the first scene gives the impression of a Dallas-style, family empire narrative, set and filmed in the 1980's. I am so glad I stuck with it for a few more minutes as Deborah Kerr began to reminisce and the story flashed back to her youth in Yorkshire.

Though the tale is soap-opera-ish, it is touching, surprisingly liberal in its view of female morality, and compelling. Our heroine is self determined, spunky and endures a great deal of trials and tribulations with barely a perceptible flutter of her stiff upper lip. At times, the over-the-top drama and stagey acting may tempt the viewer to roll their eyes, but there is just enough substance to keep you emotionally invested.

Put the kettle on, pick out your favorite fuzzy slippers, and get cozy on the couch with this well-made tearjerker.",1360368000,,886,4.6369426751592355

1226965,2,B00000INCI,Great story with terribly acting and screen play (except for actress playing the star role! One can barely make out that there is a story line to follow here! Hideous screen play. But nostalgic seventies-esque sound track and staging!,1350864000,,234,5.0256410256410255
1226966,4,B00000INCI,"I was looking for something light and romantic and came across this old mini-series from the 80's. As I have a Prime membership and this was one of the videos included in the membership at no additional cost, I though I'd give it a try. I had not read the book. The series follows a young girl, Emma, through her life and loves, children, marriages and affairs and I very much enjoyed the story and the characters. I had never seen Barry Bostick before without white hair! Both he and Liam Neeson were so very young in this movie - quite a treat to see two very good actors in their younger versions, even if Barry made a poor Australian in my opinion (his accent was very bad). My only critical comment - I've never seen such unattractive kissing in a movie. After having seen these episodes, I can certainly understand why the book would have been such a best-seller. I know how it goes the book is always so much better than the movie, but this was a good movie, so the book must be fantastic! I will be downloading it to my Kindle to add to my 'to read' list. This was a very good mini-series and I would certainly recommend it if you like these types of romance movies based on novels. Very well done, indeed. On to the sequels!",1350345600,2,1233,4.296137339055794

How wrong I was.

This is a real epic of a series and sweeps you up and let you be a fly on the wall of the main character. Many of the scenes in this series underline how the smallest of moments can shape our destinies.

The acting is excellent, and it was fun to remember that Liam Neeson had a small part in this production and has since gone on to bigger things.

For me, this rewards on repeat viewing - especially when the programme opens with the heroine inspecting her business empire whilst having flashbacks of the moments that have taken her to the top. Fantastic stuff, and don't forget the hankies:)",1307404800,,708,4.3007518796992485

Emma will capture your heart, as will her grand-daughter, Paula, as you see their stories unfold and see all the obstacles they overcome in their search for happiness and survival.

This book was unquestionably Bradford's finest hour, later pieces  degenerating into works long on sentimentality, short on literary substance (no pun intended).  Casting Deborah Kerr in the role of the middle aged heroine seems distracting, incredible, but this segment lasts only a few minutes, so no harm done.
