8037702,2,B00062J01W,"I had watched some of the content on you-tube,  but kept researching and just after I purchased this, I found rebutal articles from trusted sources showing that later research has shown this ""ark"" site to be a natural formation and the information falsified. [...] This is sad, becouse this seemed to be a prommising site.  but the Proponets of this video are decieving people with false evidence, see artilce at [...]  I am glad i kept researching, but kind of miffed I bought the videos. a lesson learned",1352073600,3,506,4.7272727272727275

8037704,5,B00062J01W,"The two videos compliment one another.  The first contains interviews with respected scientists, ancient historians, author Donald Patten, and marine salvage expert, David Fasold.  The second dvd has a strong Christian perspective.",1139097600,12,231,6.1875
8037705,1,B00062J01W,This video is very mis-leading and sensationalized.  The 'concrete' evidence of the ark loaction is created using divining rods!  Ron Wyatt is known to the Christian community as a liar and a con artist who took tons of money from interested supporters and gave back nothing but lies.  Search his name on christianitytoday.com if you want to know more.  But his video is terrible!,1137715200,14,380,4.890625
