1573574,5,B00005JOXZ,"The series was great. I recommend it highly. But there is no such DVD. David Kelley's series are problematic for DVD because of his heavy reliance on pop music and the problems getting the rights released to the music after first use. When and if such a DVD becomes available, it will probably be well worth picking up.",1155600000,25,319,4.517241379310345

This is a must own for any Boston Legal/Alan Shore/Denny Crane fan. You really get to see the genesis of these great characters and how much different they are before they got their own show.

Also some terrific acting in particular in the final season from Camryn Manheim and Steve Harris - really wish they would be given more work nowadays.",1489017600,3,501,4.617977528089888

1574187,4,B00005JOXZ,"One of my favorite shows, The Practice stood out to me for it's heart, passion and the fact the lawyers didn't always win. Every verdict was a true surprise.  And the characters were always struggling with the ethics and morals of the job they did.  And sometimes they felt the burn for what they did.

I've been disappointed that only the first season had made it to video. The second season (parts of it) are on Hulu, so that got me re-energized and I decided I might try out Boston Legal. But first I found that the final season of The Practice was available, so I thought I'd see how it went.

It starts off okay, but right away, James Spader's character seems very out of place, especially in a firm with Eugene Young.  But somehow, he remains, even though he never really went through a hiring process.  His character adds a new twist and his sarcasm and wit did pull some good laughs out of me.  But as the season wears on, the character of the show starts to turn.  You can feel the metamorphosis away from the seriousness and heart of The Practice to the slapstick and silly of Ally McBeal.

Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I did like Ally McBeal, but as a completely different show with a completely different mood.  In fact, when David E. Kelley tried to bring those shows together to boost the ratings of The Practice, it felt awkward.  That is how this feels and the season begins to reach it's climax. The final ""blow"" coming between Camryn Manheim and Rebecca De Mornay.  I wondered if I was watching the same character I had watched for years.  And by the last 4-5 episodes, I guess it pretty much had become Boston Legal with a few toss backs to The Practice.

I'm glad I saw this season, but it actually has turned me off of wanting to start watching Boston Legal.  However, it has not made me less of a fan of The Practice and I'm really hoping Shout TV (the company that produced this video) will honor us with the Emmy winning seasons 2-7 of The Practice on DVD.  I'll be first in line to buy it!",1473897600,2,2026,4.348404255319149
1574188,5,B00005JOXZ,James Spader isn't easy to like in this show but I still love the show and him!!!  My only regret is that this was the final season and  more shows are not available.  I am a big fan of ordering from Amazon because the discs are flawless.,1472515200,,238,4.0212765957446805

He's not *quite* the same as in Boston Legal (I think they were still working on nuances) but it's an interesting start to his character.

1574374,5,B00005JOXZ,"One of the greatest shows ever! The last season is great because it introduces Denny Crane, Tara and my favorite Alan Shore.

1574447,5,B00005JOXZ,Great into to Boston Legal - I recommend watching this final year of The Practice before starting the Boston Legal series because it gives the Allen Shore character played brilliantly by James Spader a backstory.,1458000000,,212,5.085714285714285
1574448,5,B00005JOXZ,"Well, I got hooked on Boston Legal primarily because of James Spader and since multiple references are made during that series to Alan Shore's shady past I decided to buy the last season of The Practice to find out more.  This series is edgy and the good guy does not always win but such is Life.  This very entertaining and although I can't imagine The Practice without Alan Shore I'm tempted to go back and buy the rest of the series.  The other actors are also wonderful but Spader outshines them all.",1457049600,,504,4.456521739130435

1574753,4,B00005JOXZ,"I got such a greater understanding of where the Alan Shore in Boston Legal was coming from, and it was fun to see Denny Crane at a time when he was almost still in charge (albeit for a mere four or five episodes). I also had my interest whetted to this other good show - The Practice. I almost wish they had occasionally brought some of these characters into Boston Legal. Betty White's character of Katherine Piper also makes her first appearance in this season.

The Practice is indeed a very different show from Boston Legal, and the sets of Crane Poole and Schmidt bear little resemblance to the ones in Boston Legal. Still, I may go back now and watch this show for its own merits (which seem to be high).",1442707200,,710,4.378787878787879

So, maybe I will try some of the earlier seasons!

There are many diehard fans who are holding off buying The Final Season because they don't want to be ""burned"" like they were when The First Season was released back in 2007 and were left in a lurch for the next seven years. Nobody wants to own only bookend seasons of a TV show they love and enjoy.

In my opinion, The Practice is one of the best legal drama series ever created and I have always been dumbfounded by what the reasoning is for not releasing the entire series on schedule.

An iconic viewing of intelligent exploration of controversial current issues wrapped in excellent acting and production. (And - the ONLY one to have actors and characters over 45 yrs of age !!).  And then again, it's got the delicious, sexy, James Spader. Who could ask for more?  Well, the actual compilation itself is, I have to say, the worst of any tv series compilation I've bought.  Each season comes differently packaged.  One has to go back to a main menu to get each episode, and then delete the FBI warnings, and skip through the ""BL so far"" and ""next week on"".  Worse, it's missing an entire episode  involving the delightfully horrible Lynton called Triple Treat.
I had to go to YouTube to watch that one. And there's something missing at the end of the season one, which in its ""next week"" flash has interactions between Alan Shore and his Death Case lawyer partner which is completely missing from Season 2.  So - I don't expect to pay in the $125 range for this sort of mess.

It had strong cases and the best ones last multiple episodes, like the  one that introduces us to the great Betty White's Catherine Piper. To me, the weak link in this season is the unfortunate story lines the back half for the great Jimmy Berlutti.

1575907,5,B00005JOXZ,"I stumbled on the Practice during Season 7. Of course the show was turned on its ear for Season 8 when a large number of the original cast was fired and newcomer James Spader was tossed into the mix. I did not watch the first few episodes, but returned mid-season and was immediately hooked by Spader's character of the ethically-challenged Alan Shore.

This DVD set is a delight, but would have been made better had some commentary by creator David E. Kelley and the various actors been included. As a Boston Legal fan I enjoyed seeing Shore push the ethical boundaries of The Practice and how the lawyers of the firm flounder around in reaction to his shenanigans. Shore's first meeting with Denny Crane (William Shatner) is remarkably understated and offers little foreshadowing of the intense bromance that would develop between these two classic TV characters. Shore's first meeting with Catherine Piper (Betty White) is somewhat bizarre and offers no hints at what is to come in Boston Legal.

All is not fun and games, however. The Practice was obviously winding down during Season 8. It was sad to see the characters of Eugene, Ellenor, and Jimmy powerless to stop the decline and eventual demise of Young, Frut and Berlutti. Had I watched the series from the beginning, I suspect I would have had enough emotional baggage invested to shed a few tears as the final scenes unrolled.

I can only assume that someone who wants a hefty licensing fee has holding the complete shows release hostage. It has to be something of that nature.  It can't be an issue like ""lost/damaged"" masters because FX and other people who have syndicated the show have broadcast masters, so you can get ""missing episodes"" if need be.

The show doesnt have alot of ""music"" on it past the theme song so it's not a music licensing issue being that they have released at least something.

SURPRISE!!!  The introduction of Alan Shore (and later, the attorneys at Crane, Poole and Schmidt) gave new life to this aging series.  Never missed an episode during this entire season.

And if you are a fan of BOSTON LEGAL, this season of THE PRACTICE is a 'must'!!  Sets all the groundwork for Shore's character and introduces many characters that followed over to BOSTON LEGAL.",1388793600,35,634,4.508771929824562
1576220,5,B00005JOXZ,"Season 8 of The Practice was controversial in that several series regulars, including Dylan McDermott, were abruptly fired from the show as a result of a drastic reduction in license fees from ABC. With that being said, I like every other Practice fan went into this season feeling pessimistic. If you can't have Bobby Donnell, why continue the show at all?  But something unexpected came along in the form of Alan Shore played by James Spader.  I quickly became a fan of his character and found the show to actually be quite good, if not well rejuvenated for what would turn out to be its final season. In fact, my only beef with this season were the final episodes. I wanted to see what was left of my beloved Practice cast and yes, Alan Shore as well. Instead, they seemingly shoved much of the show off to the side for a forced introduction of law firm Crane, Poole, & Schmidt. I was so upset about this and opposed to everything Denny Crane that I approached Boston Legal with the same hesitation I went into this season of The Practice with. Ultimately, Boston Legal became one of my all time favorite TV shows and to this day I quote Denny Crane. The moral of the story is, have a little faith in David E. Kelley. He knows what he's doing, he does it well, The Practice does go out on a high note, and you will thoroughly enjoy this season when you don't go into it expecting to hate it.",1388707200,76,1394,4.378378378378378
1576221,4,B00005JOXZ,"The Practice stands as one of my favorite shows. Certainly my favorite crime drama. For the first 7 seasons the show had a stable cast or amazing actors. Towards the end of it's run the ratings were slipping so David E. Kelley made a deal with ABC, he fired every cast member not under contract and added James Spader to the cast. The first 7 seasons of this show would get a 5 star rating, but I'm not a fan of Alan Shore or of the spin off Boston Legal. Still any season of The Practice is still better than most crime shows on TV today. I'm so grateful to Shout Factory for picking up the rights to the Practice. I'm just praying they release seasons 2-7 as well.",1388707200,14,666,4.170542635658915
1576222,5,B00005JOXZ,"When can we get more?

I don't even own a television set anymore because there is so little out there that's even entertaining, much less worthwhile.  I downloaded the first few episodes of The Practice because I got hooked on Boston Legal, although I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that in public.  BL is well-crafted and often hilarious, but I would have to call it a high grade of low entertainment, often relying on crass sexual references for a laugh.  Real often.  Don't get me wrong, I can't wait for the next season of BL either, but The Practice is much more serious-minded without ever being dull.

The Practice often deals with issues that are far from glamorous, such as defending petty thieves.  The personal lives of the lawyers are interwoven skillfully with their work, and are as interesting as the professional side but seldom take center stage, because these are men and women whose careers come first.  And one thing that's refreshing is the portrayal of major female characters who are not really conventionally attractive.  It is TV, so inevitably, some of the women are stunningly beautiful.  Several of the men aren't exactly hard to look at, either.

But it's rare to see women in a TV show who really are not very pretty, and who are portrayed as competent and intelligent.  I've heard a saying that goes something like ""Hollywood's idea of an ugly girl is a pretty girl wearing glasses"".  As an aside, I've seen trailers for a show called ""Ugly Betty"", and the lead character seems to be a rather attractive young woman who dresses funny.  Ellenor Frutt is not really ugly, but she doesn't have the type of face or figure that inspires lust or envy.  She could easily be made better-looking with lighting and camera work, but instead, we are treated to moderately unflattering shots that allow the pores on her face to show, making her seem even more like a real person.  Lindsay Dole is quite pretty but the camera, again, treats her like a regular person and sometimes catches her at a less than flattering angle.

Although the personal stuff is not neglected, the show really does revolve around the cases.  It explores the feelings that come up for Eugene Young, a tough guy who is also a very decent man, when he repeatedly finds himself defending (and often freeing) rapists and child molesters.  Lindsay is also the victim of her own success when her defense of a drug dealer begins to attract other clients in the same line of work--and she finds herself referred to matter-of-factly as a ""drug lawyer"".  I am probably combining material from seasons one and two in this review, because I downloaded them all and watched them every chance I had.  I would be glad of the chance to download the rest of them, although I would much rather buy them on DVD.

I gave five stars because this is a review of the show, but I have to say something about the ""Amazon Unbox"" experience as well.  The software you have to use to download the episodes is annoying, and takes a certain amount of patience.  I work as a PC support technician, and I'm used to arguing with software and working around its limitations, so I had only a limited amount of trouble watching these episodes.  Many of the people I am called upon to assist every day--and these are intelligent, educated professionals for the most part--would not manage it without some help and would grow very frustrated in the process.  First, the Unbox software purports to be able to play the episodes, but when I tried to do that there was a lot of distortion, rather like what you used to get when you tried to watch a cable TV channel that you don't subscribe to (maybe that still happens, I don't know, I only use cable for my internet service these days).

Rather than messing with my video drivers (which have never given me any problems with anything else I was trying to do) I found the downloaded file, which was in .wmv format, and played it in Windows Media Player.  Not difficult if you know your way around your PC, but many people do not.  And when I bought Season 2 as a package deal, the software tried to download all the episodes... found that there was not enough room on my hard drive for more than 3 or 4 of them... and hung there indefinitely, ""checking for disk space"".  I had to delete all of them, restart the software, and select individual episodes for download.  There were other times when the software hung or did not display any episodes, and I had to restart it or reboot the PC, which is very stable in general (running XP service pack 2).

Even after getting past the limitations of the download utility, I was irked when I tried to bring an episode to another location to watch it on a different PC and was prevented from doing so by DRM.  In theory, I was entitled to 2 licenses and was willing to use up the other one.  Media Player asked me if I wanted to acquire the license, I said ""yes"" and was asked for my amazon.com credentials, which I supplied.  Sounds promising, right?  Unfortunately, that was as far as I got.  It just... hung there, acting like it might do something for me but never did.  I might have been able to download the episode again in order to watch it, but unfortunately, I did not have access to a high-speed internet connection at that location.

Another thing I don't like about the Unbox thing is that I have to use up hard drive space to store the episodes (OK, I'll admit it--mine isn't very big).  And if I reformat my system partition and reinstall Windows, which I do periodically, I'll have to argue with their software some more if I want to watch the show again.  Of  course, some of these problems could be circumvented if I were willing to go to the time and trouble of running the video files through some software that re-record them in unencrypted form.  Let's face it, people, ways can be found to get around your DRM.  The people you are harming are your legitimate users, and consequently, your bottom line.  I find the whole Unbox business cumbersome enough that I would not bother with it for a show that was only moderately interesting, but I'll admit it, for this one I would.  More episodes, please!
