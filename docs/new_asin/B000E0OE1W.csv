2476767,5,B000E0OE1W,"Dames is an outstanding movie musical with Busby Berkeley numbers that will make your eyes pop out! Finished shortly before the Hayes Production Code went into effect, this lavish musical gets its strength and appeal from the incredibly wonderful song and dance numbers. This is a must have for fans of classic movie musicals!

The action starts when Ezra Ounce (Hugh Herbert), a stuffy older multimillionaire, decides to come to New York to create a foundation against the ""filthy"" Broadway shows--and give his relative Horace Peter Hemingway (Guy Kibbee) ten million dollars for being a pure man of high morals. Of course, trouble ensues when Horace's daughter Barbara (Ruby Keeler) falls in love with her 13th cousin Jimmy Higgens (Dick Powell). Barbara is encouraged by her parents Horace and Matilda (Zasu Pitts) to stay away from Jimmy and avoid a part in the show Jimmy wants to put on Broadway; but Barbara's not about to listen.

At the same time, Jimmy goes all out to get a backer--who gives him a big fat bad check. This motivates out of work actress Mabel Anderson (Joan Blondell) to take advantage of Horace Hemingway in a big financial way to get the money Jimmy needs to put on his show. Horace is terrified that even though he gives Mabel the money to put on the show, Ezra may find out that Horace was the backer and cut Horace off from that luscious ten million dollars.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Jimmy starts to pay some attention to Mabel--will Mabel steal his heart way from Barbara? Will they be able to put on the show even if Ezra goes all out to hire thugs to sabotage it? What about the society that Ezra wants to start to close down all those ""filthy"" Broadway theaters--will it work? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

You won't be sorry you watched the movie, either. The last thirty minutes or so is song and dance heaven! Nobody but Busby Berkeley could put together those beautiful, intricate and sophisticated numbers with all those beautiful women and make it look as easy as cake.

The quality of the print is excellent; and the choreography couldn't be better. As you may have heard, the beautiful ballad ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" was written for this film--and Dick Powell sings it flawlessly.

Overall, fans of classic movie musicals can't afford to pass this one by. Dames is a fine early motion picture that stands the test of time. Look also for some really good extras on this DVD.

Great job, everybody! We will never forget you!",1201132800,6,2541,4.671140939597316
2476768,4,B000E0OE1W,"By 1934, the Hayes Code was being enforced and this film, the 5th in the Busby Berkeley series at Warner Brothers, was a notable downturn in the entertainment on offer.  The problem was that the screenplay had many of the ideas of the previous films but the sting was removed from the script and tedium set in.

Many of the players returned.  Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play the love interest as usual and they continued to show improvement in their work.  Powell is animated and funny and Keeler is more charming than ever and increasingly relaxed.  Joan Blondell plays the gold digger but for some reason, she has lost her sense of humour. She also carries at least one number and her singing voice is toneless. Zazu Pitts, Hugh Herbert and Guy Kibbee are irritating.

The musical numbers, however, are among Berkeley's best.  ""I only have eyes For You"" is a beautiful tune which is still recorded today.  The screen is overwhelmed with Ruby Keelers, demonstrating today just how much audiences loved her in 1934. The title number is another in which there is almost no performing but endless kaleidoscopic effects and geometrical patterns. It is great fun.

The print of the film is excellent and the DVD comes with many extras.  The documentary about Berkeley is informative and there is an amusing short in glorious and pristine technicolour which spoofs Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. The promotions for the film, both short film and radio, are good examples of marketing in 1934 and the short film with Don Redman has some excellent jazz and blues numbers.  Finally, there are 2 charming Merrie Melodies, beautiful colour cartoons attaching animation to 2 of the songs from the film.

The DVD is good value but better if purchased as part of the Berkeley Gift Set.",1170374400,,1777,4.752442996742671
2476769,4,B000E0OE1W,"Dames is a silly film filled with great characters, cute songs, and brilliant choreography. The story centers around a family who wishes to receive an inheritance from Uncle Ezra, an eccentric man with lots of cash. He has cut off one part of the family because of a music man (Dick Powell) involved with show business. Unfortunately for Guy Kibbee and Zasu Pitts, their daughter (Ruby Keeler) is in love with her distant cousin and plans to join in his musical when it gets backed. And eventually it does, and the money comes from Keeler's father! Joan Blondell figures into the story as a swindling blonde who blackmails Kibbee for the money.

The story centers mainly around the adults who supply most of the laughs. The relationship between Powell and Keeler is immature and kind of weak, but they contribute more in song than they do to the story. They are certainly talented; unfortunately, Blondell has two musical numbers- and she's a horrible singer!

Still, the music is fun, especially the title song. The Busby Berkeley choreography is top-notch. The visuals are great, like looking through a kaleidoscope filled with beautiful girls. Other numbers are good too, although the ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" number is strange, filled with images of Keeler everywhere!

Make sure this is a musical you do not miss!",1143936000,4,1320,4.883928571428571
2476770,5,B000E0OE1W,"Let me be honest: I hate musicals. Actually, I loathe them. But this one is incredible! Great choice of B&W costumes to go with B&W photography.

Jack Webb could have made a great ""Dragnet"" episode decrying the menace of this ULTRA-PSYCHEDELIC entertainment upon the minds of youth -- and he'd be right.

2476772,5,B000E0OE1W,"A millionaire with fanatically religious beliefs tries to stop the opening of a Broadway show.  By far, the most memorable item in DAMES is the song and routine, I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU.  One of the best songs ever written for a film, it's sung by Dick Powell and beautifully staged by Busby Berkeley.  The finale of the film is another all-girl array for the title song.  Here is a fascinating rhythmic formation.  A hundred girls in white blouses and black tights configurate, fragmenting here and there into abstract designs.  Berkeley moves above for his celebrated overhead shot and the effect becomes a startlingly kaleidoscopic cacophony of geometric and floral mosaics. In the last of the grand budget-breaking spectacles before the ""Production Code"" came into being, distinguished Busby Berkeley took his imagination to the limit: watch for the dancing clothes on the ironing board and a giant puzzle pieces attached to dancing girls which form the face of Ruby Keeler.",948153600,29,979,5.049689440993789

2476782,5,B000E0OE1W,"great movie!  couldn't believe that I knew all the words to the songs, until I remembered that we played the album to death back in the 70's, borrowed from the public library!  Only Ruby Keeler can say ""gee you're swell""!",1414540800,2,221,4.5

2476784,3,B000E0OE1W,"How tastes change! There's Dick Powell, cursed with the face of a 10-year-old. Then those pudgy chorus girls with stubby legs (the gal limbering up in the doorway even has visible pits in the fat). But of course it's Busby's musical productions that save the show. There's a wonderful Fellini-esque quality to the numbers in which the stage melts into cinema in a world impossible to produce on a stage and which take the viewer off into a dreamland where anything goes. If only the entire movie had been done with as much imagination!",1391644800,,535,4.702127659574468
2476785,4,B000E0OE1W,"Busby Berkeley co-directed Dames (1934) with ho-hum stock director Ray Enright, and that may be one reason why it is among the most uneven of Berkeley's films. The plot is threadbare. Oddball moral majority-type millionaire Hugh Herbert is planning on bequeathing ten million dollars to his cousin Zazu Pitts (of 1924's  infamous Greed) and her husband Guy Kibbee. That is, on one condition--that he finds them to be ""morally acceptable"" (i.e., no smoking, drinking, or mixing up with show-biz types, especially those that do shows with those immoral dames!)

Of course, there has to be a fly in the ointment, and here it is Dick Powell. Powell's tenor persona wears thin quickly. He is such an all-smiles poster boy that one wonders what in the world that constipated Herbert might have found objectionable in him. A little background info here on Powell: the actor realized the limits of the screen persona that he had been thrust into. He waited out his youth and when he was too old to be prancing  on-screen he shrewdly reinvented himself as a hard-boiled forty something private eye in film noir. Here, he is the fellar of Ruby Keeler, daughter of Zazu and Guy. Dick wants to put on a show and gets help from the eternally underrated Joan Blondell (who became Mrs. Powell two years later).

In direct contrast to the virginal Keeler, Blondell is the much more interesting, wise-cracking working girl who manages to get Guy Kibbee into a compromising situation. She uses that to her advantage and blackmails Guy into financing Dick's Broadway production. Naturally, it will all work out.

Plot-wise, that's about all one needs to know. Unfortunately, the film does not spin the plot quite that fast and it takes some time before we get to Berkeley's numbers, but once we do, most is forgiven.

Blondell is Warren and Dubin's ""Girl At The Ironing Board"" and, on the surface, the song seems a bit subdued. But, the discerning eye will notice that not only is she singing to the fellas' shirts on the clothes line, but the shirts are singing back. This number, set at the the turn of the century, is eyelash batting cynicism that only Blondell could have done justice to (with Keeler, the piece would have fallen flat). Blondell is a good sport even when one of the undie shirts gets a sleeve-full of her tush.

Dick sings ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" to Ruby and, to prove it, he imagines every girl in the number as a Ruby Keeler clone. She's the Silver Lear Cigarette Girl. She's the Willard Hair Gal. And when she is transformed into the Society Cosmetics model she literally morphs into hundreds of  decapitated heads floating in a crepuscular abyss. The Ruby Keeler Ferris wheel is adorned with row after row of lily white twirling Ruby divas. Busby's black marble floor serves as a pond  for the Rubys, who are now, literally, water lilies. These form a Kong-size decapitated Ruby head, petrified in a synthetic grin. The real Ruby ascends from the iris of an eye, wearing a dress split all the way up to the mystery of her crotch. The army of Rubys end the high camp number by forming the pattern of a mirror handle.

`What Do We Go For? Beautiful Dames!"" is among the most blatantly sexist musical numbers ever filmed. Paired dames in negligees rise from their silky beds, stretch, and jump in a tub-full of ""Calgon, take me away"" bubbly. One shy blonde objects to the camera's voyeuristic eye and powder puffs the lens. Now it's make-up time, and of course all long-legged dames apply their foundation while wearing garters. Off to the stage and the girls, now dressed in skin-tight black leotards, spread their legs in unison, a promise in exchange for that gold ring, fellas! But, heaven promises far more than just that and your gal, on a wire, will ""float"" right up to the door to greet you! (Obviously, the genesis of the Promise Keeper dogma.) Released the year that the Hayes code went into effect, Berkeley (mostly) compensates for increased censorship by barraging the viewer with kaleidoscopic patterns. Berkeley sneaks in some jokes at the expense of suburban values and gets some jabs in through Herbert's pious, hypocritical character. The Hayes restrictions inspired some ""imaginative dodges"" on Berkeley's part, but, compared to his pre-Code films, there is the sense here that his wings are clipped, which may be another reason for the film's unevenness.

Aptly,  Dames concludes with a drunken brawl, which was, alas, all-too familiar territory for Berkeley. The eternal mama's boy had as a big a weakness for the juice as he did for the dames. A few months after the release of this film, a drunken Berkeley plowed into two vehicles, killing three people. Berkeley was charged with  triple murder. Warner Brothers invested in Berkeley's representation with legal top gun Jerry Geisler. Geisler's work was cut out for him, but he eventually won an acquittal for Berkeley after two hung juries. The studio execs at Warner's were impressed enough with the attorney that they would hire him again to (famously) get Errol Flynn acquitted of statutory rape charges.

After the death of  his mother, Berkeley went through numerous personal and career slumps. He attempted suicide several times, plowed through six marriages, was briefly committed to an institution, had a comeback in the 1960s and died in 1976 at the age of eighty. To this day, Busby Berkeley, the most innovative choreographer in cinema, does not have a star on Hollywood Boulevard. But, who needs reality?

2476787,4,B000E0OE1W,"I watched this one on a lark but enjoyed it. It features a moral madman named Ezra who is seen as the rich villain. He's a very funny character. He dissaproves of a certain family member who decided to become an actor. But this movie isn't really about plot.

2476788,4,B000E0OE1W,"An old fashioned 1930's sentimental musical.  Audio not crisp, which is indigenous to the movies in 1930. Dick Powell in fine voice and form. Several tunes to keep you humming all day long. Ruby Keeler in her heyday; an adequate dancer but a very cute presence. Not a great movie, but will keep viewers entertained listening to Dick Powell singing ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" and the Busby Burkeley staged choreography make it a nice movie to view.  However, the line from Keeler about being ""White, 21, and free"" would never go over with today's political correctness, so it would probably have to be edited out or a substitute word dubbed in.  Routine plot and adequate acting from supporting cast make this a movie easy on the nerves, but definitely very dated in every possible respect.  I liked the music and the fact that when Dick Powell sang, one could understand all the words, unlike what is paased for music these days.  One of the grand old musicals of the 1930s awaits your viewing. A breath of fresh air from long ago.",1291334400,,1031,4.612021857923497

2476790,4,B000E0OE1W,"One can appreciate musical films such as this and others made by Warner, MGM, RKO, et. al. during this period from several standpoints.  For one, they were the source of many of the popular songs that became standards over the years --  songs that had discernible and memorable melodies, a genre which largely went out of style in the 1950's with the rise of the rock and roll song form and just about everything else that followed.  Since these films were made before technicolor became the norm, cinematographers managed to create the seemingly impossible using black and white film for numbers such as those in ""Dames"", and ""The Lullaby of Broadway"" from ""Golddiggers of 1935"" or any of the Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers films.

But one also has to appreciate these films as technical achievements with synchronized sound having been developed only six or so years previous.  The audio of the musical number would be recorded and approved first.  Then the ensemble would be photographed perhaps several times from different cameral angles for a given number, possibly days or weeks apart, using the playback over studio loudspeakers of the prerecorded song to permit the ensemble to be synchronized or soloists to lip-sync to the recording.  This allowed the editor and director to then make selections from the various takes and interweave them to make the most desirable edit.  And it would all be in sync because all the takes were made using the same recording.  Think about that the next time you watch the closing number of ""42nd Street"" made in 1933.  I suppose all this is obvious to many people, but it continues to boggle my noodle thinking about the skills with which these things were made.",1273968000,3,1703,4.881944444444445

Dames is a wonderful film just like the Gold diggers films, Footlight parade, 42nd St, etc. The non musical scenes are amusing such as Hugh Hubert's hiccuping bit and his need for Dr. Silver's Golden elexer, Hugh's threats to cut off anyone who goes into showbusiness ""like a ripe banana"", Zazu Pitts as Guy's wife, and Joan Blondell blackmailing Guy Kibbi by sneaking into his bed (once on train, and once at his house) and threatening to scream if he didn't play along. The musical parts were amazing. The title song had some of the most astonishing fancy pattern work of Busby's ever with all the girls seen from overhead on white floor wearing white shirts and black pants, the visuals of all the pattered and  moving kylidascope shapes they all formed was absolutely amazing, I still can't figure out how they did it. Joan Blondell's Girl with an ironing board was really cute and clever with the talking clothes, the beautiful girls dancing, Joan doing a Mae West ""come up and see me sometime"", and them braking into 42nd st's "" Shuffle off to Buffalo"" for one line. I only have eyes for you was wonderful and charming. Ruby was beautiful and charming while Dick Powell was singing to her, and I personally loved as they were walking onto the subway the charming way Ruby spoke her line in the song "" and if you know you're in a garden, come'n answer me"". Then Ruby looking beautiful on the subway smiling and then closing her eyes still smiling just before Powell started dreaming of 30 pictures of Ruby's face dancing around. Then the wonderful part with Ruby and 30 Ruby lookalikes in the same dresses and hairstyle dancing around with the wonderful singing during that part of the song, and the sweet, beautiful way Ruby looked at the first close up shot of that part, and throughout all of that song. Then the fourth number ""Try to see it my way"" which was the only number out of the 4 without the fancy photo shots and Busby magic, and it was clearly shown as a stage number. And it was the only number where they cut back and forth between the stage and the audience including showing Hugh, Guy, and Zazu watching it.",1505779200,,2248,4.573200992555831
