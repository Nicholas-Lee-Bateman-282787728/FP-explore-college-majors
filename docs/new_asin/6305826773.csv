I wish it would be released on dvd, along with maybe Bigfoot and wildboy, dr. shrinker, and lidsville.",1339286400,,280,4.30188679245283
7896498,5,6305826773,"I loved this show.  I couldn't wait until Saturday so I could watch it (along with Dr. Shrinker - anyone remember that one???)  I used to wish Fi and Fum would come get me so I could travel along with them. :-) Ruth Buzzi and Jim Neighbors are fantastic.

5 stars for the wonderful memories this show brings back!",1106697600,3,313,4.271186440677966
7896499,5,6305826773,"I remember seeing Lost Saucer on one of the Saturday morning preview shows that used to come on the Friday night at the start of the new season. For some reason, seeing the previews for this show really captivated my 9 year old mind. Like all of the Krofft shows, they are somewhat (cheezy, zany, campy), but as Krofft fans we love them. Ruth Buzzi and Jim Neighbors play androids Fi and Fum who pick up a kid and his baby sitter and take off in their flying saucer, and  cant find their way back to earth to take them home. Like I said, more Krofft craziness, but you gotta love it. 5 stars for being Krofft, and also for the nostalgic rush. I just wish Krofft was still on tv today on Saturday mornings....",1061856000,8,708,4.2444444444444445
7896500,5,6305826773,"Just a good old fashioned Sid and Marty Kroft Saturday morning TV show.  I can remember watching this show as a kid and loving every minute of it.
For those of us who grew up in the seventies here's another classic Saturday morning show that you can't do without.  Where does the time go...Fun entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously, just some good old goofy fun.  Buy this and have a good laugh!
