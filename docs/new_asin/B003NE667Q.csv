8400879,1,B003NE667Q,"Given the title and the picture for it on the Amazon page, I thought this video was going to feature some kind of spring break antics.  Instead, it consisted of someone carrying a camcorder walking back and forth along a street that bordered a beach. No kind of interaction . . . no action at all.  Just a video of people sitting and walking along the sidewalk.  Clearly, I missed the point of this because I considered it to be a monumental waste of my time.",1329609600,14,459,4.313953488372093
