sadly within 40mins they show all the matches except 3...
tokyopop have made this dvd as more of an advert for the commercial video because they cut down a brilliant 4 hour show to a meesly 2 hour highlights reel.
lets hope in future they show the full events
apart from those gripes, its a great disc with 3 excellent full matches and good highlights albeit short",1009670400,2,425,4.461538461538462

Tommy Dreamer/Raven vs. two Japanese guys I don't remember (WEW tag titles)
Tanaka vs. Fuyuki (Loser leaves 15,000 volt cage match for WEW title)
H (Hayabusa unmasked) vs. Hayabusa(fake Mr. Gonnosuke version) with Shawn Michaels as Ref.
