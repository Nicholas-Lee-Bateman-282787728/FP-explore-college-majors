3598058,3,B001G9CNRC,The video quality was not enhanced for these clips.. thus you are watching and hearing clips that are not clear and often muffled.  This would have been great if the material had been remastered.,1363737600,,195,4.735294117647059
3598059,2,B001G9CNRC,"I had big hopes for this movie, but if failed to keep me and my kids interest for more than a few minutes since it doesn't have more than a handful of Christmas songs in it.",1356393600,,173,3.8333333333333335
3598060,5,B001G9CNRC,"My father is 90 years old and remembers all the details of the entertainment acts of the 1950's. Of course the quality is not HD but it is very watchable. There was a nice variety of music and comedy acts from the era collected and spliced together smoothly. Many of the acts had little or nothing to do with Christmas but were packaged together to help the troops overseas enjoy the holiday. Judging my my father's happy reaction, it was a great trip down memory lane and I enjoyed it also.",1353715200,11,491,4.406593406593407
3598061,5,B001G9CNRC,"This is a special show, or rather series of shows, that was put together for our troops in the fifties.  There are numerous great stars (at least 50) from the period of time when Hollywood still had its glitter and glamour.  Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Rhonda Fleming, Bing Crosby and many more make this a real delight.",1255478400,19,314,4.491228070175438
3598062,1,B001G9CNRC,"I am being generous (the Xmas spirit) giving this DVD
even 1 star !!

This show is NOT a television ""spectacular"".
What this is, is a compilation of approx. 3 minute
""skits"" from a vast variety of 1950's performers
(most of whom you WILL NOT KNOW).

This was spliced together for a 1958 USO tape that
was sent to 750 military bases around the world.

Visual quality is poor at best, and very little
Christmas theme throughout.

There are MUCH BETTER ""Christmas DVDs"" offered at
lower prices. Very disappointing.",1229731200,8,511,4.707865168539326

3598074,4,B001G9CNRC,"For those whiners who for some inexplicable reason were expecting high-def,  please go away, don't watch and don't comment. This is a slice of time from the 1950s, showcasing some of the biggest film and TV stars of the era. It was produced, copied and distributed with period television equipment, with all the technical flaws that are even more evident today than they were then. Absorb it as history as much, or more, than entertainment.  Relax, travel back in time and hoot at the dated stuff and smile at old faces not often seen.",1482278400,,535,4.680851063829787

3598102,5,B001G9CNRC,"It was wonderful seeing this show in its original black and white.  I read most of the negative reviews and can only assume that those that wrote them were probably born in 1980 or later.  They don't remember black and white TV.  This is America's history and it is warm and colorful - makes up for the black and white.  Yes, it is a little grainy and a little fuzzy in sound.  It was filmed 65 years ago folks.

3598134,3,B001G9CNRC,"The cast did their thing OK. My mom may have watched this?. We watched the Lawrence Welk Show, The Ed Sullivan Show, and whatever else was on then that was funny. I left home in January 1961 for the Navy, and we had the TV for 3 years by then.
I still had 2 more years of  high school left in '58 when this was released and I can now remember how bad the quality of TV was back then. How fast we take to improved technology. But Hollywood & The military who put this together sure didn't put much investment into it. It was a quilt of patched together tributes to the troops for Christmas. I sure laughed at the jokes. Remember, this is not a TimeLife digitally re-mastered video & audio. So it is of bad quality.
I sure miss the funny comedians of the 60's-70's like Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Red Buttons, George Burns, & some of Milton Berle. Todays comedians are not funny at all, just foul mouthed and then the audiences laughs??? There are not any funny ones out there anymore, not that I have ever seen, when once in a while I tune into the Comedy Channel to see.",1447632000,,1078,4.207729468599034

3598155,3,B001G9CNRC,"The title of this show is very deceiving, in that, if you are looking for some nostalgic ""Christmas"" content, you will only get nostalgia here and little to NO ""Christmas"" content.  Lots of really great performances by some of the best singers and performers of the Golden Era of days gone by but, none of the songs are ""Holiday Songs,"" making this in fact, viewable ANY time of the year and not necessarily at Christmas time.",1423612800,,426,4.605263157894737

3598157,5,B001G9CNRC,This is a fun show to watch. It has many vignette style numbers by starts from years past. It was fun to show the young kids clean humor and talented dancers.

There are some great performances and it's fun seeing a lot of the older actors, such as Milton Burle.  The only strange thing is that there didn't seem to be a Christmas theme at all, despite the title.

3598233,5,B001G9CNRC,"This production was put together for American troops quite some time ago. You just might be too young to recognize most of the people on stage, but they were the top of their craft. The All-Star Christmas Show was a Christmas ""gift"" to the armed services. I don't think it was ever televised for the general public. Fortunately, this video remains as a tribute to the kind of participation made possible back then by various networks and studios in the interest of a patriotic effort. You have to wonder if such a program would be possible today.

The All-Star Christmas Show should not be evaluated by production values, sets, scripted material and so forth. What you will see here are some of the biggest names of their day doing whatever was necessary for a great cause. One of the numbers was a spoof of vaudville illustrating just why vaudville ""died."" It was great to see how much fun they were having quite intentionally putting on a second-rate act!

If you would enjoy a trip back in time to watch what the spirit of patriotism can create, The All-Star Christmas Show is for you.",1395187200,,1088,4.632124352331606
3598234,5,B001G9CNRC,"If really big movie stars and others visited your base during a military action, what would YOU probably want to hear? Imagine yourself back in the 1950's, answer this question, and you will probably come up with the contents of this disk. It is not a collection of Christmas features, but instead, it is full of skits and other stuff in the style for which each of these stars was already famous.

If I'd been wanting a Christmas compendium, I'd have only given this three stars. It's okay as a Christmas collection.

BUT as a collection of skits showing these big stars AS THEY WERE KNOWN WAY BACK WHEN, this is definitely a five star collection.

If you are looking for a show full of Christmas songs and skits, you might be disappointed. This wasn't filmed for the public, but for our troops in the 1950's.

But if you would like to see ONE HUNDRED stars in a production that involved the cooperation of ABC, CBS, NBC and virtually every ""Guild"" and ""committee"" of its time, doing what their friends overseas would like to see them do, then this is for you.

3598236,5,B001G9CNRC,Seeing all the stars in the Christmas show brought back so many memories.  These were the days when you actually had to have talent to be a star.  Loved it!,1389744000,,156,4.166666666666667
3598237,5,B001G9CNRC,It brought me back to years gone by.  Very enjoyable to see so many stars from the past all working together.  I strongly recommend. It was so wonderful to see,1389398400,,159,4.266666666666667
3598238,1,B001G9CNRC,"You have a spectacular stable of talent, and this is the best you can do with it?  Danny Kaye acting stupid with an Orchestra?  James Stewart, George Burns and someone else I cannot recall in a dance number?  None of it tied together, had the appearance of having been filmed in multiple locations, and no interaction.  Badly filmed in many cases.  Shoddy, ugly, meaningless, lackluster, time wasting, boring, sad use of the incredible talents of a splendid cast.  Very few high points, not enough to offset the general mediocre quality, or worse.",1389139200,,547,4.891304347826087

3598253,4,B001G9CNRC,They captured a gem here.  All of these stars donated their time so that a film could be sent by the USO to our troops.

I guess that's just the way it is, or better yet, WAS.  Film in those days was really grainy and doesn't show well on a HD TV in my opinion.  Perhaps we're just spoiled.",1387238400,,308,4.066666666666666

The acts that were really fun were with Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong was great.  The other act with Jack Benny, Jimmy Stewart, and George Burns was very fun - really enjoyed watching Jimmy Stewart try to sing and dance while Benny and Burns tried not to laugh.

3598265,5,B001G9CNRC,"This gives us a great look at what the entertainment world was like back in the fifities, and of particular note are early performances of well known celebrities. Since we don't have the same vast amount of video from that time as we do in ours, there are some rare glimpses of people like Danny Thomas and Milton Berle doing comic routines which give us insight into how they became famous in the first place.

I had never cared much for Milton Berle, but in this he was funny and it was interesting to note his technique in his stand-up routine. His rythmns and timing were great. Also, with Danny Thomas, so expressive and creative. I only remember him from ""Make Room for Danny""-in this he imitates his ""Italian Father-in-Law"" who had his own style of 'English'. Great stuff.

There is Danny Kaye-doing essentially the same bit with the orchestra as I remember seeing decades later. Singers, dancers, funny to see the ideals of beauty and what was considered 'cool' in those times. Also some famous actors. Van Clyburn performs, fresh from winning a competition in Russia. So YOUNG yet already he looks pretentious LOL-not that great of a pianist either, IMO.

Priceless as a historical look at the entertainment world of the time.",1386028800,6,1235,4.761682242990654

The quality is just fine for those of us who grew up in the motion picture and black and white television age, it's better than many old movies (think 1930s-40s) pictures I watched on late night TV as a kid.  It really IS a trip down memory lane -remember the days when we all supported the troops, the USO was a big deal, the entertainers considered it civic duty to do something for ""the boys in uniform""? There's even a short speech by the Secretary of Defense (!) and the sort of final number you'd expect.  (I wonder how many non-veteran and non-veteran family Americans can ""name that tune""?) Don't get me wrong, I know there were negative things in that era.  Women were second class citizens, the South (and not just the South) had ""white only"" ""colored only"" restaurants, toilets, and even drinking fountains, and so on.  After this terrible crazy election year it's good for a moment to look back and cherish what was right, remember what was wrong, and renew the commitment to foster the first, stand up against the latter, and uphold the Constitutional bedrock of the USA into the future.",1482710400,3,1248,4.558035714285714
