8199934,4,B000RC1FLO,"Clearly, he knows his stuff, but no one seemed to step back and analyze the information before they pressed the DVD. Within the first minute I am confused. I am not a beginner but I press play and you are into an excercise- I was expecting a brief explanation as to what we are hoping to accomplish first. A description of sweep picking seems like it would have been a good idea before you run headfirst into an example. I have my guitar in hand and am working on it wondering why there was no description. . Odd. Then the descriptions start 5 minutes later.
Two major things threw me. We're starting with a B Major sweep. I am staring at it and realize- no it isn't. That is not B Major... then 10 minutes of being confused I realize what is going on. He has a Capo on the fretboard and never mentioned it. This throws everything off.
Also, instead of just saying to play 14 on the e string, you should also tell me what note it is.
The biggest confusion on this video is this- why would you ever make a guitar video using a 7 string guitar? 99.99% of guitar owning people use a 6 string guitar. A 7 string guitar is advanced and confusing to look at for non 7 string guitarists. Why would you ever want to possibly confuse a viewer?
With this being said, I know there is stuff I will get out of this DVD, I just wish I wasn't so confused early on.",1362614400,2,1349,4.152671755725191
8199935,5,B000RC1FLO,"You guys have to be kidding about the tab! Yes, it's true... there is no tab for this video.... but Andy tells you very slowly and simply what fret to play on what string before he ""SLOWLY"" plays it..... if you have a problem catching on to something as simple as that.... I don't know what to say. This dvd really kicks some serious ass! It seems like all of the other lessons that I've seen for Sweeping elsewhere always show the same two arpeggios..... This one goes very far out of that ""box"" and shows you some very interesting stuff! I thought that I was an intermediate player for sweeping until I watched this video...... and now realize that I am in between beginner and intermediate.... There is still a lot to learn, and this is the perfect front for me to learn from. Thank you Andy for making a bad ass dvd!!!!!",1274486400,3,824,4.357142857142857
8199936,4,B000RC1FLO,"Andy James absolutely creates a brilliant and insightful DVD on the use of sweep picking in the release. No doubt any player with a few years of experience could benefit from this tutorial.

But.......

This DVD is over an hour long. It is divided into 3 sections or exercises ( beginner, intermediate, advanced). Each section concludes with a 2 to 3 minute etude that is the culmination of all the bits Andy shows.  The issue for me is that there is no tab or notation included. The whole DVD could be made 100% more user friendly by giving the examples in standard notation or tablature.

Lick Library makes some great Dvds and Andy James is a great educator. Tab would be a welcome addition to their products.",1198540800,10,712,4.582677165354331
