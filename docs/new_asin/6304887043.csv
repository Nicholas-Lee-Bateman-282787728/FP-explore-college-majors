7879445,5,6304887043,"For anyone not knowing too much about evolution, except the insane Evolution vs. Creation debate, this sure is an eye opener! Don't get me started on the idiots and their delusional Bible thumping arguments. It's thanks to paying attention to those uneducated religious twits that my knowledge of evolution was delayed for so long. Not so any longer. Now thanks to programs like this, I have a much better idea as to how our early planet took shape!!! I'm not looking for anything totally accurate, speculation can be a good thing when its not employed in nailing somebody to a cross.

I was very skeptical about this program at first. But I gave it a chance and did I ever find it so immensely informative and entertaining at the same time. Moreover my basic knowledge of evolution is now vastly increased. I have so much more interest in what may have happened so long ago.

One of the most interesting topics covered by this program is the discovery of Cro-Magnon man. Flying in the face of this whole man vs. ape argument is the fact that Cro-Magnon man, just showed up! Out of no where. There does not seem to be any ansestorial roots beyond the fact that he was just discovered.

I think its high time those Bible thumping wanna-be's are put in their place concerning things they know absolutally nothing about. And let science and common sense rule the day.

Deepak Chopra once said; ""Our new physics is not only stranger than we think it is, it's stranger than we CAN think.""

I think the answer to the question, ""Where did man originate?"" is indeed stranger than we CAN think and if we can only open up our minds to the possibilities, then just maybe we'll find an answer!

First, some basic errors.  It states that Homo erectus was an ape.  That's wrong.  Later on it states that Homo erectus was a hominid (true).  It states that bonobos (which it mostly calls ""pygmy chimpanzees"" although we know now that is a misnomer - chimpanzees and bonobos are different species) are the only apes that can walk upright.  Then in the very next sequence, they show chimpanzees walking upright.

Next are a couple of observations in the ""just plain nuts"" category.  First, that Paranthropus robustus (i.e. robust Australopithecines) made stone tools.  Nuts.  Next is spoken language is a result of standing up straight (no mention of the hyoid bone or the hypoglossal canal).  These might be some of the ideas floating around out there, but they are certainly not those held by most scientists in Paleoanthropology.

To boot, the film perpetuates the old misconception of ""survival of the fittest"" and goes on to say that ""the strongest pass on their genes.""  Two big mistakes with this:  It's not enough to survive.  You have to reproduce in order to pass on your genes and be ""fit"" in an evolutionary sense.  The idea that ""fitness"" means ""strength"" is erronious.  The successful individual could also be one who makes tools, or is smart enough to outwit a predator.  Such a statement in a film like this, which is supposed to be educational, just contributes to the misinformation regarding science and evolutionary theory in particular that is so common in society.

Finally, many of the graphics, especially those showing early hominids, are truly cartoonish and based more on stereotype than on factual data.

I was truly disappointed by this program, in a number of ways.  This has the potential to be a very good program, but instead is too full of errors to be shown to someone who might believe it.  Discovery Channel markets this series under their ""Discovery University"" sub-brand.  If they want to create a niche in serious educational films, they should put some real effort into hiring good writers and editors.",1113955200,3,2234,4.940860215053763
