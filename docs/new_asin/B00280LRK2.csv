3870387,5,B00280LRK2,"This DVD was beautiful. I loved the music and scenery. The scenery was breathtaking. I have never seen anything quite like it and the author Isha Judd was quite lovely to listen to and to watch.

For anyone interested in modern wisdom this is a keeper!",1264032000,,252,4.478260869565218
3870388,5,B00280LRK2,"I read the book first and then bought the movie.  I highly recommend them both but if you can not afford them both, I would recommend the book.  Thank you Isha Judd for writing your book and making the movie.  You are a gift to the world.",1254700800,2,238,4.0212765957446805
3870389,5,B00280LRK2,Isha's facets are magical.  They are extraordinary healing tools that serve as a catalyst to get on with your life's calling.,1254182400,2,125,4.9523809523809526
3870390,5,B00280LRK2,"Wow!!!I bought her book and dvd just from seeing an article on care2petition site with a photo of Isha and her hawk and the article. I was so inspired by her photo for some reason with her hawk that I was driven to find her book and dvd and learn more about her. One person's longer review was so convincing and appreciative of Isha and the artistic beauty in her movie....Well I had to get it. From the second her movie starts, you are drawn in by the visuals and her deep,calm melodic voice. She hypnotizes you to come into her world of spiritual beauty and connectiveness she has with the universe. The image of her riding a horse with her hawk is gorgeous against the sunset sky. Isha is a very sexy( in a good way),sensual,graceful mature woman who has the voice of wisdom and truth. I resonated with her truth and beauty immediately. I loved her so much I shared this movie with a few more members in my family. My 85 year old Mother really liked Isha and enjoyed the beauty of her riding amongst the free running horses. Oh to be free and wild like them. It is only an hour but once you see it, you are glad you allowed her into your world for but a short hour but somehow you know you can never forget her.",1251590400,8,1214,4.214592274678112
3870391,5,B00280LRK2,"Great movie for our spiritual cinema night at church.  Great photography, great message.  Loved it!",1251417600,,99,5.533333333333333
3870392,5,B00280LRK2,"I have just finished watching this video and I can highly recommend Isha's ""Why walk when you can fly"".  It is an easy and comfortable method to apply in every day life but it has the the lasting effect that I have been searching for.  Being an advocate of meditation this is a simple and profound method, that I really relate with.",1250640000,,332,4.338709677419355
3870393,5,B00280LRK2,"Six months back I got the book ""Why Walk When You Can Fly?"" it was wonderful. I was deeply touched by the teachings of the Isha. Same is with the movie. Its based on the book with the same title. Its wonderful, visually spectacular and opens the heart. Its very beautifully filmed over magnificent landscapes, ocean, fabulous horses and animals. The way Isha explains with wonderful stories is so sweet and magical. In this movie Isha teaches how easy it is to find love within ourself.

In the movie, Isha teaches the facets, which are very simple and extremely powerful tools to anchor in Love Consciousness. In fact, the whole system is there in the movie. Practicing the system is very easy and it brings profound experience of inner peace, joy & love. The movie very much inspires to focus on consciousness while in our daily life. What I found from my experience,  ""Why Walk When You Can Fly?"" is really what the title says, WHY WALK.. Simply FLY! It provides really great tools to expand the consciousness in each moment while still living the busy life in a modern city. Its a joy to watch it over and over again :-)

And last but not the least, no theories, no beliefs, its all about direct experience! Its so easy anybody can experience it. Highly Recommended!!!",1241395200,26,1272,4.619469026548672

Really love the stories in this and the Places she takes you inside your own heart. The music is amazing too.

8355360,4,B00280LRK2,"Isha Judd is challenging and practical in her approach to becoming all that one desires to be.
The 'facets' she teaches you to say, and repeat often, focus your thoughts and easily begin the transformative process.",1369699200,,214,4.972222222222222
8355361,1,B00280LRK2,"I researched the author Isha Judd because I was thinking of going to one of her meditation seminars. I am based in based in Mexico while travelling, and Isha has a centre in Manzanillo, Colima. And I found some very disturbing news about her organisation. She has been reported to the Argentinian police by her ex-followers in Buenos Aires who have accused her of brainwashing, slave labour in her hotel and for charging them a lot of money for 'enlightenment'.

They say she owns race horses and various ranches off the back of her success as a spiritual teacher. One article I read said she has changed her name since the hoo ha in Argentina, and that she was originally a trainee of an Indian meditation/ personal inquiry system - I think this is called Isha - the group banned its teachers from charging for this teaching.  She since then broke away from that group and adapted the method and changed her name and claimed the system as her own.

You can find the information - which is in Spanish and translate it using Google Translate. Suggested search terms could be 'ex seguidadores denuncio' - which means ex-followers complaint. or 'denuncio isha buenos aires'.

If a teacher is teaching us to let go of our egoic selves - and see our connection as consciousness to everything in the universe - then by example we can observe their own lack of ego. They won't be too concerned about physical appearances or grasping to achieving material success because they see all this stuff as fleeting and as giving a false high swiftly followed by a come-down...

On a more uplifting note I recently listened to 2 audio books - Gangaji's Diamond in your pocket - also a  self enquiry method of achieving equanamity. And also Eckhart Tolle's the Power of Now. Both I thought were very strong and authentic and very helpful. It's important that we put our weight behind the authentic teachers - please do investigate for yourself and make your own mind up. I hope you will buy their books not this one.",1319846400,12,2005,4.649717514124294
8355362,5,B00280LRK2,"I love Isha most for her humanitarian view.  She makes change possible for the common man.  So many teachers these days make themselves unavailable, to most of the world's population, due to students lacking the funds to receive the teachings, being part of a disadvantaged group that fall thru the cracks, not having the time to study complex teachings etc.  Thank you Isha, for making such a simple system available to all.  Buy her book and/or DVD and you're on your way to a blessed life.  Let go of fear, despair, lonliness, disease.......and fly freely!!",1297555200,,560,4.852631578947369
