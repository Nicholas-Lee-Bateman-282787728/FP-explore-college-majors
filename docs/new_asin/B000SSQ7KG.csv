2890143,5,B000SSQ7KG,I purchased this dvd for my grandaughters as an alternative for the products that are available.  I liked the story line and the morals of the characters.  I am hoping that other dvds will be made in the future.  My grandaughters love them and watch them constantly.,1314489600,,266,4.617021276595745
2890144,5,B000SSQ7KG,"This movie is so cute. My 4 and 2 year old love this movie and all the other Holly Hobbie  movies. The music is great the story line teaches kids how to be nice to others and consider other peoples feelings.

2890145,5,B000SSQ7KG,"My 5, soon to be 6, year old daughter loves all the Holly Hobbie DVDs but this one is her hands down favorite. She adores the song where the Hey Girls try to chase away summer boredom by pretending they are French Fashion Models. These dvds do tend to have kind of fun, catchy songs and this one is no exception. I like the Holly Hobbie dvds because they are basically wholesome without being too sappy. They teach good values like helping others, respecting elderly people, and dealing appropriately with conflict, be it between siblings or friends. They may have a couple tense moments but really couldn't be called scary. They are a good way to balance out they abundance of fairy tale princess stuff that overwhelms the girly dvd market with something a little closer to real life. We love princesses, too, don't get me wrong, but it's nice to have something that doesn't involve any magic spells or generically handsome princes for a change.",1209859200,5,946,4.704819277108434
2890146,5,B000SSQ7KG,"I think it's important to teach our children to value the elderly, and this one reminds us all that our elderly used to be young and vibrant.  It also helps us to consider that one day, God willing, we all will age and want to be valued.  These deeper lessons may be picked up by the parents more than the children, but the movie is another solid Holly Hobbie production that helps young ones consider others and respect their elders using a lot of light-hearted fun to make the lessons go down easily.",1199145600,,502,4.387096774193548
2890147,5,B000SSQ7KG,My 3 year old daughter loves Holly Hobbie and Friends. This DVD has a great message about helping out in you community and respecting elderly people. We love this movie!,1198627200,3,169,4.666666666666667
2890148,4,B000SSQ7KG,"Holly Hobbie finds herself back with her friends in her newest adventure, ""Best Friends Forever."" But as things start out, the girls are a bit bored. It's been a bit of a lazy, unexciting summer and they feel they have nothing to do. But then, Holly's Aunt Jessie urges them to look at the world with new eyes. She says she's never been bored in her life because the world is too exciting to be bored.

Holly ends up meeting a lady named Annabelle Crow, one who has a very special surprise for her. But when Annabelle gets some bad news, Holly must work together to unite the community in helping her friend.

One thing I continue to love about this new ""Holly Hobbie"" series is the blend of the old and the new. Holly and her friends live in the modern world, but there's something pleasantly nostalgic about the world they live in. And Holly values and finds meaning in history.

One of my favorite moments in the film comes when Kyle and Robby get into some trouble with old-man Willie Scranton. He orders them to report to his house early in the morning for some work and they don't even *dare* think about arguing. You don't see too much of that these days. And in the end, they find some common ground.

Another great thing about the ""Best Friends Forever"" DVD is that the amount of bonus content has increased. They've included a quiz about the events of the movie. And though many of the questions are extremely easy, there are some stumpers in there as well, and I'm not ashamed to say I missed a couple. There's also a game where you can dress up Holly. And finally, there's a sing-along for all three songs from the film, which the option to play the songs with or without vocals. Finally, there are previews for other DVD releases, among them ""Shedderman Rules,"" ""Open Season"" and ""It's a Big Big World.""

Overall, another nice ""Holly Hobbie"" DVD release! I look forward to seeing more soon.",1197072000,3,1903,4.488439306358382
2890149,4,B000SSQ7KG,"I have mixed feelings about this show, but ultimately, it's great.  My 3 year old daughter loves it.  She asks to watch it every day, which is where my mixed feelings come in.  I'm pretty sick of it.  But if you're looking for a show your little girl will want to watch, this will work.  It has a very short scary part, but my daughter, who is skiddish and makes me fast forward through scary parts of OTHER movies, is NOT scared during this one.  I like the message too, it's basically about helping someone in need.  And it's not too long, about 40 minutes.",1190073600,6,559,4.266666666666667

8206766,5,B000SSQ7KG,"My almost eight-year-old daughter saw this DVD at a store recently and asked me if we could get it. It had been heavily discounted and after I read the synopsis at the back, I decided to give it a try. We watched it several days ago and we both loved it. The show is only about 44 minutes long but it packs quite a lot into that time frame. The story centers around a young girl named Holly who happens to be the great granddaughter of the famous Holly Hobbie.

The story follows Holly and her friends as they wonder about the mysterious and dilapidated Crow House and about its inhabitant, the lonely old Annabelle Crow. When Holly eventually meets Mrs. Crow she discovers that the old lady used to be friends with Holly's great grandmother! This sets the stage for the pair to develop a warm friendship and when Holly learns that Mrs. Crow's house is to be demolished, Holly rallies the community together to help Mrs. Crow.

I loved this story because I felt the themes of friendship, community, and helping a person in need were great values to be passed down to children and the story was well done. My daughter enjoyed watching Holly rally her town to help Mrs. Crow and loved the message underlying the story. She also liked the songs incorporated into the story. We have since purchased a couple of other titles in the series and hope they are as good as this episode.",1357257600,,1376,4.47808764940239
