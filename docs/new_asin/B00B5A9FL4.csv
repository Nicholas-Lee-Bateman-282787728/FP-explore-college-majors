5558526,4,B00B5A9FL4,Great product but expensive to have delivered to Ireland. Surely it could be provided online download much cheaper. Dvd was good quality.,1369267200,3,137,5.2727272727272725
8562818,5,B00B5A9FL4,"As far as I am concerned, DDL is the best of the best, so I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD! These are stories I had not seen before and it was a delight.",1504656000,,149,3.6875
8562819,1,B00B5A9FL4,"Terrible recording quality.  Interesting movies, movies are almost unwatchable due to poor quality.",1498867200,3,99,6.615384615384615
8562820,5,B00B5A9FL4,"excellent movies of early Daniel Day-Lewis, loved them when I found them at local library and had to put in my collection",1448841600,,121,4.545454545454546
8562821,2,B00B5A9FL4,"Although Daniel Day-Lewis is a terrific actor, these episodes are from his very early years.  In two of the movies, Daniel plays a very limited part.  Only one of the three movies was what I would call three star.  This trilogy somewhat disappointed.",1445990400,3,250,4.767441860465116
8562822,3,B00B5A9FL4,Did not care for dark filming,1430265600,,29,4.0
8562823,2,B00B5A9FL4,"Although most would say you can not go wrong with a DDL tripple feature, I found these movies to be terrible. If you are the hardest fan of DDL i suppose you may like it. But if you are expecting LOTM, GONY, or TWBB, you will be strikingly dissapointed. To give any of my perceived slights the benefit of the doubt, I gave this set 3 stars.",1417392000,,340,4.08955223880597
8562824,5,B00B5A9FL4,"I am a Daniel Day Lewis fiend. I have seen most his movies, and love that this collection contains lesser-known works.",1388620800,,118,4.666666666666667
8562825,4,B00B5A9FL4,"I bought this after reading about it on the New York Sunday Times last spring.  The article got me interested in other Daniel Day-Lewis movies, so I have been on a quest to see them all.  I realized this would not be in a library, so ordered it.  There are three BBC short movies or plays.  One does get to see how Day-Lewis is able to perform radically different characters.  ""How Many Mikes to Babylon"" is an excellent piece of writing  that is a beautiful testament to male friendship.  Day-Lewis plays a ""Christ"" character.  ""The Insurance Man"" is a bedlam sort of setting with the Day- Lewis character as the sane one in the midst of the chaos.  There is complete nudity of both the male (not Day-Lewis)and female bodies, refreshing that it is not just the woman.  ""Dangerous Corner"" has Day-Lewis playing a weak, sniveling character which he acts perfectly and detestingly.  It is a clever bit of writing...a parlor drama with two endings for the viewer to contemplate.  BBC, as always, produces wonderful period pieces.",1376784000,4,1026,4.734463276836158
8562826,4,B00B5A9FL4,"This is a terrific 3-pack of Lewis' early work.  You can see the beginnings of his signature style, especially his facial responses, his head gestures and his vocal signature when speaking to women.  It's a great treat to see one of the world's finest actors in his Thespian infancy.",1372291200,3,283,4.755102040816326
8562827,5,B00B5A9FL4,This is a must see. Watching the greatest actor of this generation when he was very young is so interesting.,1371340800,3,108,4.45
