Vasst (the production company that makes this DVD) makes several instructional DVDs. Most are ok with pros and cons. This DVD is excellent. 2 hrs of in and out of every feature of a excellent all around workhorse of a camera. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would really have liked practical suggestions and strategies on using many of the cameras features. Don't get me wrong, it's already 2 hrs long. But I think it needed a real practical side as opposed to just a comprehensive checklist. Even if it meant a follow up video. But an EXCELLENT resource nonetheless.",1408838400,,771,4.514285714285714

the only thing lacking is the GPS.  He states it is there but nothing on displaying it.",1314403200,,137,4.230769230769231
