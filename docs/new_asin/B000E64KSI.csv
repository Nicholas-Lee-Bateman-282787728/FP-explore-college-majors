In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the game was played in Atlanta, making it a true oddity.
This is ABC's complete telecast of the 2006 SUGAR BOWL without commercial interruption. While the postgame is offered in the BONUS FEATURES, pregame and halftime are not available. Also, there are a few edited huddles throughout the telecast. The picture quality does not quite measure up to the other offerings from this same bowl season. While still very good, the word ""excellent"" does not apply with this release as with others from the 2006 bowl season.",1488758400,,746,5.122950819672131

When we finally found it, we ordered it and I think he has watched it over and over again for about a month now.  The quality is great, the color is beautiful, and he is very happy with it.",1362441600,,268,3.8545454545454545
