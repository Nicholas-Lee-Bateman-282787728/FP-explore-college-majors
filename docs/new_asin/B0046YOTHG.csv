8417519,5,B0046YOTHG,"This is the movie version of the classic TV series and features the same cast with one exception.  Richard Beckinsale is replaced by Christopher Strauli.  The major difference from the TV series is in the setting.  Rigsby's boarding house is a light and bright London row house as opposed to the rather dark setting of the series.  The story lines will seem familiar.  Many are taken directly from the series.  The series was based on a play, and they have taken the ending of the play and used it here.  This ending never appeared in the series and it's worth the watch to see it here.
