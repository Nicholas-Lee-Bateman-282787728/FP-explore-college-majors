2217126,5,B0007LBM22,"I have spent the last several nights watching episodes from the 2nd season of this incredible show. What a gift this series was. Good, clean episodes written beautifully with wonderful characters. This show had such a calm pace to its writing. And each episode transports the viewer to a different time when life was more about people than material things. All of the episodes I've watched so far have been excellent. As much as I remembered loving this show, it is still much better than I ever imagined. By all means, revisit Walton's Mountain.",1115078400,12,546,4.819148936170213

2217129,5,B0007LBM22,the first few years of this Show were must see tv to me. I always enjoyed watching the waltons. they always found a way to bond together&make things work.the cast was very strong&I truly believe that is what made this show work so well&for so long as well.,1114300800,,256,4.354166666666667
2217130,5,B0007LBM22,"The Waltons show has been around for decades with lots of humor, suspense, and value for your family to appreciate.  The depression era is a rough time for this Virginia family and you can see why.  The Waltons brings you  a family that lives on Waltons Mountain in Virginia.  It shows the struggle and heartache it can be to live in these times.  It also shows how much fun that John-boy Walton has (Earl Hamner) and how he makes the most of the times.  This would be a great additon to your families collection and you can treasure the memories of this show as many of you had growing up.  Amazon will soon offer season to so make sure you pick that up as well!!!",1113264000,6,665,4.272
2217131,5,B0007LBM22,"This is the best season of the best show ever on TV! The technical quality of these DVD's is truly astounding, just superb!! I could just watch these episodes over and over, especially the ""Ghost Story"" episode! This series such a powerful and amazing show! I really hope that all the other WALTONS seasons get released soon!",1110931200,10,325,4.719298245614035
2217132,4,B0007LBM22,"Seminal!...If you're a ""Wall""-nut phile who loves one of the best series ever to appear on television this is the can't miss for you...Pulse pounding mountain jug joy!...You can feel the Blue Ridge Mountains rippling through you, and the twangy honk of that harmonica while the goodnights are done at the end of each show brings the ""70's"" back for me although the series was set in the nineteen thirties...
A couple of things for the serious fans of this show...There is a lack of the ""extra"" tidbits that appear on other series...For instance we don't get commentary from Will Gear on the time he got the runs in the middle of the ""Easter"" show, Ellen Corby on her ""recipe"" for Vodka cornflakes, or comments from John Boy about how he had a secret crush on Mary Ellen in real life!...
( Okay..any ""Lol"" pumpkin heads that think I'm unaware that the senior members of the show have passed on...I haven't...hence current adlibs aren't possible...I'm talking about unmined bloopers and comments that might be in outtakes in the shows old footage..) ..So let's hope some more extras are included in future collections!..but the episodes themselves will purely delight the fervent fan who may have vaguely remembered the series from the seventies but hasn't seen it much or at all since....
The first season...highly recommended!... sets up the following years and this second season nicely...there are many tie-ins here that you will need to see to appreciate future seasons...Several of these second season episodes are directed by ""Mr. Walton"", Ralph Waite,..Don't miss the opener directed by him that has John Boy helping a lady relive her younger years...A touching episode to say the least...Note that series creator Earl Hamner himself appears in this first second series episode as the old ladies husband!...His only appearance in the series!...
.. Early story lines continue to germinate in these episodes...Jason's musical ability is featured, Mary Ellen's business sense AND the forshadowing of her caring nature that leads to her nursing career is explored, and don't miss the dearly departed acting talents of John Ritter in several episodes as the Reverend Fordwick!...Before he was on Three's Company!..But basically,
DON""T MISS THIS COLLECTION IF YOU""RE A FAN!...Every episode will bring back fond memories, and there isn't a goat in the herd!...You ""Heard"" it here first!...Note that Amazon's price in the high twenties isn't bad for either series seeing how you can get shipping included...Wallmart is selling the first series for thirty dollars but you're going to pay tax and the expense and time of going there to get it...
GET THIS ONE!",1110412800,10,2655,5.091743119266055

Yes it romanticizes the Great Depression, but I appreciate how it depicts the way a loving, supportive family approaches both everyday and difficult life issues, The Waltons are the ultimate functional family. Unrealistic? Perhaps, but I would rather watch them than many other TV families which are fraught with ridiculous dialogue and unreal situations. Furthermore Earl Hamner's narration is lovely.",1459123200,,525,5.414634146341464

A few years ago, working in Maryland as a critical care nurse,  I covered a patient for a few minutes for a co-worker, and after talking to the elderly gentleman for a few minutes, I finally asked him if he was from southwest Virginia; not only was he from my mother's hometown, but he used to know my grandparents.",1425945600,,662,4.409836065573771

In times when morals and values seem to be declining it's refreshing to watch how this family dealt with all sorts
of life issues that are still relevant today, and always will be.  All aspects of living are dealt with including financial
decisions, health issues, death, and loving and caring for family, friends, and neighbors.
It teaches kids how to make good choices on their own, under the watchful guidance of parents, grandparents, and
adults who cared about them.
I've purchased Season 1 for my grandchildren in hopes that they will benefit from the wisdom that is available in this
wonderful series.  I have already purchased Seasons 3 & 4 and I plan on purchasing the rest of the series.",1424217600,,813,4.678321678321678

The fact that series creator wrote this episode, and thus may be presumed based at least on his personal experience, gives some reinforcement to the values proclaimed.",1417219200,,447,4.881578947368421

Those of us who were not yet born have no real appreciation for what our parents and grandparents went through.

People say it is ""sappie""...maybe, but who would not like to have a happy marriage, a peaceful, pleasant home, and children that are obedient, well mannered, and become productive adults....in any age?  There is much to be gleaned from these stories, and even the various actor's portraying the characters of these stories had their lives changed by simply taking on the roles they did.  I LOVE watching these old films over and over again, because they have much to teach in this day and age where even simple civility is questioned!

start of each episode the same Model ""A"" Ford Truck is used and you can hear the honking Ahooga Horn but the horn isn't
hanging below the driver's side Head Light where the original Spartan Model ""A"" Ahooga Horn should be hanging. You also
notice that the original ""32"" Ford Head Lights disapear as the series progresses and Model ""A"" Lights appear on the ""32""
Sedan Delivery (Panel Truck). They may even be with Sealed Beam Conversion Kits, I can't really tell? I think it's fun to look
at some of these period things like The Color Purple, for instance, that has Oprah riding around in a ""One of A Kind"" Model ""A""
Ford 28 or 29 Deluxe Phaeton. The Deluxe Phaeton was only made in 1930 and 1931! 5,000 units each year! It's fairly obvious, The Deluxe Phaeton had a single door on each side of the vehicle but the 28 or 29 Phaeton was a Four Door
Vehicle or Two doors on each side. Yankee Doodle Dandy has a 1930 or 1931 Deluxe Phaeton in one of it's last scenes
when the Teenie Boppers show up they are driving it, but it has a Chevy (Chevrolet) front end on it. The distinctive gas
filler cap is in plain view on top of the cowel in front of the windshield as on all Model ""A""s, Not Chevys! It's fun to find all of
these Boo, Boos! There really are a lot of them if you know what to look for on Walton's Mountain. It's sad to say but none
of the vehicles used in Walton's Mountain are really in the shape they should be for being less than ten years old (Most of
Them)? John Boy's Coupe looked a lot better Green than when he painted it that nasty yellow color. It really makes you
wonder if these props were pulled and pushed off and on stage or if they really ran?",1372291200,,1802,4.151428571428571

While I think the ""Good Night"" scenes at the end of each episode are a bit corny, I especially like the grandmother Ellen Corby, and her strong temper. She's the star of the show IMO, with grandpa not too far behind. Each episode is another story from the depression times in Virginia, mostly involving the family and community. And they are interesting. I also recommend watching the Homecoming, which is a Christmas story that inspired the series. It's hard to pick a favorite episode, but if I had to it would be ""The First Day"", John Boy's first day at college. And ""The Car "" when John boy works for his first car.",1359331200,,736,4.5

When the Holidays came, she got Season 2. Getting 26 episodes per season gives a person much viewing time and eventually she will have all of them.
She was pleased to find herself with a gift of the 2nd Season, so I know the 3rd will please her also.

The fictitious Walton family provided many hours of joy for me, as I allowed myself to get carried away in an era where life was quieter and somewhat simpler. The plot dealt with many issues and conjured emotions that made me feel both happy and sad. Considering that the Waltons was set during The Great Depression I feel that Earl Hamner has brought the story to life with dignity and respect. The Waltons family were salt of the earth type people who at times come across as a bit cheesy, but it is my opinion that if you can't have a bit of fantasy in your life, then life is not worth living.

2217423,2,B0007LBM22,"It's really quite sad that one of the classics of American television has been so poorly packaged and given such a poor transfer in its first few releases.

Others have noted the poor quality of the packaging--Warner Brothers did a similarly poor job of packaging Veronica Mars, by the way (though thankfully these are one sided). I would only add that the WB could have stuck The Waltons seasons in a box like that which CBS/Paramount's packaged Beauty and Beast in. B&B season sets consist of thin boxes in which each disc has been placed on a separate disc holder. This makes it less likely that discs will damaged during transit or during use.

As for the transfer, its quite poor. I don't know what the original elements are like but there is noticeable damage in the transfer as well variable quality in the film elements themselves--pops, clicks, graininess, variable levels of brightness. I suspect that WB did the least possible when they put together this package and it shows.

Finally, let me add my two cents worth on the other bargain basement aspects of the set. As others have noted there are no commentaries, there are no extras that I can find, there are no chapters, there are no English subtitles, and you have to manually turn off the French subtitles.

In sum, the WB should be ashamed. They won't be, however, because it's not about the fans and it's not about the show. It's about money--the WB making the most money with the least amount of effort on their part.

Though I always found Richard Thomas (John-Boy) a bit ""actor-ish"" in his role, the series always hung on the excellent performances of Ralph Waite and Miss Michael Learned, (Did she ever get married, I wonder?) as well as the rest of the excellent cast.

The strength of the show is the great writing and the excellent relationships the characters had with each other. Things rarely got bored, tedious, or drawn-out, even though the material covered a lot of topics. Things always seemed very interesting around Walton's mountain.

I really identified with the people on this show. They were wholesome and believable in an entirely different way than on shows like Father Knows Best.

The quality of the relationships, the strong morality (as distinct from strong ""values""), the clear, kind, sensible thinking and interaction that is depicted on the screen is amazing.

This kind of television would not be made today.

- Who would write it?
- Who, even in their imagination, thinks so clearly about ""difficult"" moral issues?

There is hardly a shared vocabulary in modern society for even talking about moral issues, let alone advancing them.

The people depicted in this program are not perfect, but they are being perfected. They are growing. And most important, that they are supposed to be kind, hard working, long-suffering, patient, that they are to do what's right regardless of the cost, is written firmly on their heart, even when they occassionally stumble in their actions.

Unfortunately, these people are only characters portrayed by actors. But they are portrayed so well, they give us all a model for behavior and thought to aspire to.

That some would aspire, for the benefit of us all.",1148601600,11,1372,5.089285714285714
2217440,5,B0007LBM22,"Well, where do I begin.  I have for so long now wanted to see the re-runs of the 1970's programme The Waltons.  I purchased the first season, quite by chance, seeing it in a local shop.  Once watching that and rekindling fond memories of the show, I decided to purchase the second season and must admit that I am absolutely thrilled with it.  It has become my fantasy world, a world that no longer exits, but one I wish did.  Just to see the family coping with the very simple basic life back then tends to make me envious and wish I could turn the clock back.  The series is so good, I have introduced my children to it and they too, love it.  I am looking forward to purchasing season three and would recommend this series to anyone.",1142640000,4,735,4.244604316546763

2217443,5,B0007LBM22,"I loved the second season as much as the first season of the Walton's.  In this day of sitcoms with sarcastic children and selfish parents, it's refreshing to step back to a time when family values meant sincere caring about family members, honesty, and selfless giving.  Coming from a large family myself with little money to do with while growing up, it was with nostalgia that I empathized with the Walton's in their struggle to survive.  There are so many real things one can learn by having to go without.  The family togetherness was so nice. I just really enjoyed every episode and can't wait for the third season to come out!!",1138838400,8,634,4.633928571428571

2217458,5,B0007LBM22,"I have to admit, I've always been a fan of the early episodes of the Waltons, especially the first three or so seasons. I still find the characters to be finely drawn, the plots simple but effective, and especially the adult roles to be marvellously played. The early shows are touching without ever descending into bathos or sentimentality. Some have great resonance and power. The lean Depression years are carefully reconstructed. Among the actors, Michael Learned, Ralph Waite, the great Ellen Corby and Will Geer are all outstanding. And Richard Thomas is beyond praise. A reminder of when television was not afraid to convey simple, rather than simplistic, truths.",1122940800,4,670,5.155963302752293
2217459,5,B0007LBM22,"Other reviewers have thoroughly reviewed the details of the Waltons first year on TV with titles and plot descriptions, so I won't elaborate further. Instead, I will tell you why I feel this DVD set is perhaps is the best series that ever aired on TV, and is true family entertainment.

The Waltons first aired in 1972 on CBS. It was considered ""hokey"" by some of the critics of the day, yet it captured the hearts of the viewers and went on to be one of the finest long-running series on TV. It captured peoples hearts because it told stories of real people, real people in a family that loved and cared for each other. Although many of the stories are of course fictional, the writer, Earl Hamner (who is actually John-boy), weaves fiction with real-life drama and shows how his loving family dealt with the hard times they grew up in, and how they related to each other with love. In essence, the Waltons shows the viewer what all of us would like our families to be like. One cannot help caring about the characters because Hamner does such a great job of developing their unique personalities for us. The actors and actresses that play his family are perfect for the parts, and even though many of them are just children, their realistic acting makes one believe they are actually a real family. The series is carried on the shoulders of three central characters, John-Boy (Richard Thomas), his mother Olivia Walton (Michael Learned), and Father John Walton (played by Ralph Waite). All three are absolutely superb in their respective roles, and earned honors and accolades for their depiction of Hamner's family. When these three characters eventually left ths show in later years, the show itself folded.

If you have never seen The Waltons on TV, my suggestion is that you buy the first season shows before viewing the second season set.  Although not entirely necessary, as each show is a complete story, the first season will unveil the general themes and storylines that help you to better understand the characters and their dire economic situation (the Great Depression).  You will also learn that although the Waltons had little money, they were not ""poor"" when it came to their bond of family love for one another.  The second season, (24 episodes) is just as good as the first season, with family stories that will capture your heart. The second season won several awards, an emmy for Michael Learned (Olivia Walton) and an emmy for writer Joanna Lee for her script, ""The Thanksgiving Story"".

I watch the Walton shows with my own 6 children and even in these modern days with so many other distractions, my kids are thrilled with the stories. Each child relates to a particular Walton child, and after finishing an episode, they beg to watch another.  I hope that they will learn family values by watching the Walton family interact with each other.  I know that I have garnered some parenting tips from John Walton.

Television does not get better than The Waltons. I recommend this series for those viewers who desire more family values and less violence, sex, and questionable language and topics in their tv viewing. This is true family values TV, and I wish we had something like it today. The Waltons will capture your heart, and you will come to love the characters and care about them. Thank you Earl Hamner for sharing your lovely family with us!

2217460,5,B0007LBM22,"Nominated for 15 Golden Globes and 25 Emmys, including two for Outstanding Drama Series, The Waltons enjoyed nine seasons of high audience ratings and notable critical acclaim. Premiering on CBS in the Fall of 1972, the hour-long drama series chronicled the lives of a tightly-knit mountain family living during the Depression era. Creator Earl Hamner Jr. based The Waltons on his true-to-life story of growing up in the Hamner family. Noted for its family-oriented subject matter (and absence of torrid sex and violence), The Waltons paved the way for the success of the popular TV series Little House On The Prairie (1974). And, in the aftermath of the cancellation of The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and Green Acres (1965), proved wrong the assertion of some CBS executives that shows with rural settings were becoming unpopular. Celebrated for its raw depiction of the human experience, The Waltons towers above modern day television dramas by laying claim to the added weight today's critics give to ""realism"" in a series while simultaneously avoiding the bad language, adult content, and gratuitous violence that often accompany those shows which earn such a designation...

The Waltons follows the daily lives of the various members of the Walton family as they make a living working their humble saw mill on Walton's Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Set in the 1930's, the series unfolds through the eyes of John Boy (Richard Thomas). An aspiring writer, John Boy chronicles life on Walton Mountain where his parents, John Sr. (Ralph Waite) and Olivia (Michael Learned), raise their seven children (John Boy, Jason, Mary Ellen, Erin, Ben, Jim-Bob, and Elizabeth) with the aid of live-in grandparents Esther (Ellen Corby) and Zeb (Will Greer) Walton. A wide array of supporting characters live near the Waltons, including Reverend Fordwick (portrayed by Three's Company star John Ritter), the Godseys, the Baldwins, and various others. As the trials of the Great Depression fade into the tribulations of World War II, the Waltons connect with every facet of the human experience - love, marriage, birth, death, aging, social ills, and the numerous travails of life, making The Waltons one of the most popular shows in television history...

The Waltons (Season 2) DVD features a number of memorable episodes including the season premiere ""The Journey"" in which Maggie McKenzie would like to see the ocean one last time in her life, and John Boy agrees to take her, although he must miss an important dance in order to do so. Meanwhile, Grandpa Zeb and the kids nurse and injured bird back to health. This episode is also notable because it boasts of being the only show of series in which creator Earl Hamner (playing the role of Maggie's wife) appears... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Fawn"" in which Erin nurses an injured fawn back to health while John Boy becomes a collections agent for a notorious landlord, and ""The Honeymoon"" in which John Sr. and Olivia enjoy a belated honeymoon in Virginia Beach...

2217463,5,B0007LBM22,I enjoy revisiting John Boy and the rest of the Walton gang.  These classic episodes allows me to relive my childhood.

It truly stands the testament of time.,1116633600,10,329,4.52542372881356
2217464,5,B0007LBM22,"We've had to wait an entire year for the release of season two.  I hope this is not the case for future releases.  I'm especially looking forward to season 4 which has my all time favorite ""Walton"" episode in it....""The Burnout""...the episode when the house is gutted by fire in the middle of the night.  But, back to season two.  I agree with the reviewer below with the tight packaging and the 2 sided disks are a pain with them overlapping and all.  But besides that, the quality of the DVDs are wonderful, the show is timeless and the episodes are first rate! My particular favorite is ""The Gift"" with a young Ron Howard guest starring as Jason's best friend who has leukemia.  This episode is a real tearjerker and I cry buckets every time I see it.  Its not full of sap sentimentality but honest truth about loss and grief.  There are two memorable scenes in this episode.  The first is Ron Howard (Seth) running out into the woods after he finds out that he has only a short time to live.  He runs out and screams and cries his heart out because of the unfairness of it all.  The other scene is the poignant and touching guidance and wisdom to Jason from Grandpa (Will Geer)helping him cope with the grief that is hurting him so much.  Jon Walmsley as Jason is outstanding in this episode and the haunting strains of ""beautiful dreamer"" as he plays it on the flute at the end....well...just have the kleenex handy!!  How can you honestly compare the wasteland that television has become today with a program like the Waltons?  Its wonderful to see a quality program like this restored with quality!  I'll take a program like ""The Waltons"" and pit it against all the reality crap on TV these days.  Do your youngsters and family a favor and ""watch"" ""The Waltons"" together as a family!  If they don't want to, ""make them"".  My parents did that with me and I turned out o.k.
