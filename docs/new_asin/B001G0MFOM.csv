3589851,1,B001G0MFOM,"I think tee shirts are in order here that simply say L Word 6 WTF ?
I own the other 5 seasons and I'll probably purchase season 6 only to complete the set (can we say OCD......) but I'm not too happy about it. What a waste of film and time. Maybe this was the plan all along; to have us endlessly write about how crappy the ending was ?? Too bad really, the show, characters and the fans deserved better.",1240185600,19,404,4.0
3589852,3,B001G0MFOM,I loved this show but the ending was just horrible you would expect something better then what it really was but it just didn't happen which for me was a gigantic disappointment. rest of the series was great though and totally recomend seasons 1-5.,1239753600,5,248,4.659090909090909
3589853,1,B001G0MFOM,"It's so disgusting that I'm having trouble writing how disgusted and POORLY the last season was written.  The big exec's must have really said ""end it now"" for the producer to do such a crappy job.  She must know that we won't forget what she did if she puts out a movie or attempt another series.  Such a disservice to the actors who took a chance on the series and to leave in that fashion........ ARGH!  poor....very poor.  Actually I thought the series really took a dive after season 4.  I got bored with the season 5 jenny's movie thing.  It showed true L word fashion in the last 2-3 episodes.  I'm really having a hard time justifying buying season 5 and 6....except to show how it went down hill fast.  I would like to know the REAL reason they ended the series....drama perhaps!?",1238284800,27,789,4.423611111111111
3589854,1,B001G0MFOM,"""The L Word"" has been my guilty pleasure television show for a numbers of years now.  I honestly have no idea what originally  brought me to the series, nor can I think of any particular moment when it became appointment television, but eventually its hooks got sunk into me and I was lost.  I thought it was a beautifully written, shot and acted series with plenty of drama (but never overtly over the time) and a very very talented cast.

Despite this, I was shocked with how downright awful the final season of the series is.  The final season (which the writers were given an entire year to write and shot), is composed of an 8-episode mystery of *SPOILER* Who Killed Jenny, with the first act of the season establishing the arc and the remained of the season played in flashbacks leading up to the big moment.  Yet, the writers never say  who killed her, leaving the story wide open.  That's right, a 6 year series with a definite finale ended on a cliff-hanger, in a very anticlimatic episode, and honestly painful to watch episode.

Beyond that this season every character did something or revealed something ridiculously out of character that just kept changing the entire dynamic of the series, and not in a good way.  After watching this on showtime, I'm pretending the series ended with season 5.",1237334400,116,1307,4.668122270742358
3589855,2,B001G0MFOM,"I am still digesting the finale, which I watched two days ago with a big group of friends and many other people around the world.  I think I heard screams of unfulfillment across the land when the credits started rolling after its ""Soprano's like"" ending.  All I can ask is...why?  Why would they end it like that?  Not only do I think they should have told us who killed Jenny, but dang it, I wanted to see Jenny confronted about many things she had done up to that point.  She had this crusade about ""everybody needs to be truthful"", therefore ruining their lives... but it came crashing down with Shane finding the letter and movie reels.  ugh.  I am just very ticked off and therefore cannot give a decent rating to this SHORT as it was final season.  Very disappointing.
Since that night, I've been all over the internet in search of who killed jenny.  Showtime is currently showing ""Interrogation Tapes"" that supposedly give more insight to the killing.  Through imdb.com and E! Online, I've learned that Alice has a spin off called The Farm, where it says she gets convicted of Jenny's murder and sent off to prison.  E! mentioned rumor of a movie to finish things off.  Now this is all fine and dandy, but just boils me more that I want to know NOW... and the show, being the first of its kind...just should have been a better show in its final season.",1236643200,52,1360,4.483739837398374
3589856,5,B001G0MFOM,"I have seen all 6 seasons of this show and this show is awesome in it's portrayal of the life and loves of the lesbian community, it is so REAL! I commend the writers and producer of this show and the actors and actresses that have played these parts. Being a lesbian myself I relate to all this show portrays. I am saddened that this show is ending. However they should have killed Jenny off at the end of season 5, she is mean and vendictive. I can't stand Jenny, she should have died instead of Dana, Out of the whole cast my favorites are Shane,Bette, Alice, and Carmen. I have the first 5 seasons and I plan to order the 6th when it comes out. I will watch these over and over again, I LOVE IT.",1236124800,10,699,4.109489051094891

3589918,3,B001G0MFOM,"I watched the first 3 seasons of this show on Amazon Prime. I've decided not to watch any more because I no longer care about these narcissistic self-righteous characters. At times, the show was well written and acted, but by the middle of the third season, it was on a downward cycle with repetitious melodrama, everybody screwing up and apologizing endlessly, and the introduction of characters I didn't like at all(the Moira/Max character was especially annoying). I don't know how accurately this series reflected the lesbian world in LA, I only know that I don't wish to spend any more time with these women.",1480377600,,613,4.903846153846154

3589998,1,B001G0MFOM,"Sadly, this has to be the worst last season in TV history. I simply cannot understand how writers that were able to write amazing storylines for the prior seasons, wrote this crap.  The only story worth watching was the one of Beth and Tina. They completely destroyed (and killed) the character of Jenny, played by a magnificent actress; the comeback of Helena and Dylan was just stupid; the threesome of Alice and Tasha, again, stupid, but Leisha Hailey is so funny in everything that you always have to laugh watching her. In terms of Jodi, her presence in this season made no sence and it was a waste of Marlene Matlin's talent. Shane, I liked the fact that she finally hooked up with Jenny, but again, what a bad storyline. In summary I was sad to see how this series concluded after enjoying the other seasons so much.

Many characters grew emotionally through the series and we were able to see the changes within their relationships. Unfortunately Jenny seemed to regress into a spoiled child throwing tantrums every other episode and it was painful to watch. Shane remained the same player unable to maintain any romantic connections it was sad not being able to see another Carmen come into her life and help to enjoy an intimate relationship.

3590052,3,B001G0MFOM,"I am all for the judicious use of the suspension of disbelief in TV and film, but this season of this show went a bit overboard for me.  The way all the relationships come together is completely unconvincing and contrived and forced all of these characters into caricature cutouts of themselves.  I did still enjoy watching it on one level, it just didn't have the same impact it could have.  I won't go into specifics because I don't want to drop any spoilers.  I will say, on a positive note, that the actress who plays Alice gives the most consistently engaging, fun, and spontaneous feeling performance from the first episode of season 1 up through the finale.  Many other characters are so written and performed so manically that their behavior stops making any sense and I stop caring what happens to them from one moment to the next.",1430956800,2,840,4.648648648648648

3590116,1,B001G0MFOM,"Completely disappointing last season. The beautiful languid style of the first five seasons totally sucked me in.  Watching in marathon mode probably made the sex seem more gratuitous because I was watching many episodes a day.  While I was caught up in the stories, the sex seemed to be overly long and used to fill in the time requirements.  I really didn't need to see every journey to orgasm to understand that characters had amazing sex and with who. The strength of the series was  the treatment of the characters and their support system.  The natural flowing plot and dialog made it hard to stop watching to attend to real life. Marathon watching will really point out any weaknesses in story telling and character development and anything that just doesn't ring true. Season six really flunked the Marathon Test. Choppy, strange and obviously just a race to the finish, was Season 6 totally out of place in the organic storytelling of the previous five seasons.  I'm not sure why time was wasted with a few of the less critical characters, new characters and minor contrived storylines.  The wasted time could have  allowed the primary stories and characters to move forward into a more natural finale.  I couldn't shake the feeling that somehow the writers of the first 5 seasons were replaced for Season 6, either literally or spiritually.  To end the good feelings imparted in the previous seasons, I agree with one reviewers suggestion Season 5 be considered the Finale.  In retrospect I wish I hadn't seen Season 6, ""The Downer"". In fact. someone should have stolen Season 6 in the same way the ""lez Girls"" reels disappeared!",1412208000,,1639,4.859712230215828

Almost gave me a feeling like I was watching a mild porno movie.  Gratuitous is the only way I can describe the abundance of sex in the beginning shows.  As a TV director, didn't think it was necessary.  But once the characters were developed and the plot moved forward one realized the power and beauty of friendship and love between not just women but men and women as well.  Then the following shows  became more about people, lifestyles and choices. Not sex.  Moreover I left with the feeling it's not so much as who we love, but that we can love.

When ""The L Word"" first came out, there were so many of us who were excited! Finally, a television show that spoke and showed how we lived! Yes, *we*. Unfortunately, like most mainstream art, this television series recycled many stereotypes while still tackling deeper issues in the Queer community (Max, as a transman would've had a deeper voice by the time his facial hair grew in as a beard though). This series finale was horrible. Too often there are deep fissures created between communities, and the LGBTQI aka Queer community has a great deal in common with the DisAbled community - including how both are identified as unnatural. The Jenny character had some type of emotional capacity which forced institutionalization, and in the end - that this character continued the widespread damaging beliefs of intentionally harming others as well as being a facade ... that was just bad. Really bad writing.

3590311,3,B001G0MFOM,"I have all seasons 1-6, however, when I got the last season I was trying to savor it. Season 6 is still in it's packed plastic. And since I wanted to watch it in a ""flow"" fashion I started back from the beginning. And I started watching the lovely seasons on here :D

Now for the bad news. Season 6 was so confusing and all over the place. I agree with other reviewers it was definitely rushed and no one was really in character. Including Shane..WTH happened to Shane LOL

Let me start from the beginning. Once I reached the climax of season 5, I kept procrastinating to watch season 6. Finally I watched the first episode which started with chaos of ambulance and the group of girls in Bette and Tina's house. So my first question when I saw it was ""Did Jenny kill herself?"" of course I would have NEVER thought to ask ""Who killed Jenny?"". Let me start with

Bette and Tina: I'm very excited that the show ended with them having a strong relationship in the end. I knew they were going to get back together, but I was doubtful at the same time because I didn't think that Bette could be faithful. Bette definitely has a problem, but I'm happy Tina stands her ground and placed a nice line for Bette not to cross. I just think that, that girl trying to seduce Bette was completely left field. I did like how they ended the show with them starting over together in a new state. That was the best ending for them.

Alice and Tasha: I love them together, I feel they make a wonderful couple and they have strong views and convictions, however, the whole three-some friendship situation was just plain stupid and weird. I would have been so upset if Tasha got with that girl. But nope, in the end Alice and Tasha stayed together YAY!

Max: OK, when I first began watching this show and they first introduced FTM on the show, I knew nothing of them. After dating a FTM I have come to realize that they did a complete horrible interpretation of what a FTM is. First of all, when a woman starts taking testosterone EVERYTHING changes. Body mass, facial hair and something they truly didn't think about that made this whole thing unrealistic THE VOICE. When a woman takes testosterone their voice gets deeper. They should have done their research. As my girlfriend says, It would've been great to bring an actress already in the process of taking testosterone and as the show and her process went along you could have gotten a realistic transformation. But Max's character is bizarre to me.

Shane: What can I say about Shane except she should have stayed with Carmen, they made a beautiful/sexy couple. But she had a distorted mind thinking that she's just like her father, so she just follows in his footsteps. But with Carmen, they had a strong relationship and I really thought Shane would change. After Carmen though, I really just said she's a lost cause. She will never commit. And I just really don't understand her reasoning for being with Jenny. That relationship began bizarre and fast, it didn't have a build up at all nor did it make sense. Did they just wanted to push the envelope on a strong friendship turning into a relationship? And why with Jenny, you of all people because you know her should know how she is!!! Oh Shane.

Jenny: I hated Jenny after she cheated on Tim. I hated her even more once she started getting her career off the ground. She reminded me of me and at first I could relate to her. However!!!! When she started to act weirder and weirder, crazier and crazier and not to mention a stuck up, snobby person I just said oh no. And forget it I wished she didn't exist in season 6. I just wanted people to bring her back to reality and to her senses and knock all that shadiness she was doing. I do agree with a reviewer on here, it would've been nice for everyone to confront her on her B.S.

Helena: Her story line was good up until she left with the prison girl. After that she made no sense to me, she just kept on doing stupid things. Like getting back with the girl who sent her a subpoena for sexual harassment. What in the world?! I just really didn't like her character in season 6, it was just plain stupid.

Kit: After Ivan I really fantasized about her being with a woman and actually get into a commitment with a woman. But that never happened because her body doesn't respond to her own kind as she says in season 6 LOL very disappointed. Now what I don't understand is the drag queen that she ends up with in the end. They really didn't open a story line for him. Just that Kit and him were ""girlfriends"". But every time they interacted I kept saying they were going to hook up. Then once the queen revealed the man underneath the make-up as a straight man who loves the gay community I was actually surprised and gave him a thumps up, but it didn't reveal why he was a drag queen. Aren't there other job positions available? But Kit started falling off the screen. She was in the background and to be honest I forgot she was even there. And I loved me some Kit in every season, but season 6 she really wasn't playing a role.

All in all, I hated it. I hated the fact that it was the last season and that there was only 8 episodes. I kept saying to myself as new dilemma kept arising that there wasn't enough episodes to resolve any problems. Then I came to the conclusion that something happened to the production of this show and my guess is that there was way more seasons that covered all the dilemma that happened in this season but it would have revealed itself gradually and it would have made more sense. They had to end the show somehow so they probably put at least 3 more seasons into one, but it was just a disaster.

To be honest I didn't like the show focusing on Jenny at all, who cares?! I say she killed herself. But apparently someone killed her and if I had to say who it was, my first suspicion was Bette, because they were talking on the unfinished stairs over the pool. If you ask me there was I think four suspects: Bette, Tina, Shane and Nikki. They all have motives. But I don't know. Season 6 was just so horrible!",1369267200,4,6083,4.355379188712522

I mean yes some moments in season six I really enjoyed but overall I was disappointed. For the record I really would like to know who killed Jenny or if Jenny just killed herself instead of playing with different possibilities in my head but then again mystery isn't all bad I guess. Frankly i believe if Jenny did not do it herself it was Bette.,1368316800,,641,4.17741935483871

But Helena loses her fire; Shane ties herself down in a horrid relationship; and Jenny... if possible, she acts even crazier than before. So in general, characters act very uncharacteristically throughout this season.

That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but the finale in particular left me feeling very unsatisfied. It's bad form to present a huge mystery and then not answer it. Personally, I think Sounder did it. Man's best friend? I think not.",1356048000,,693,4.815126050420168

The finale of season five would be a better ending than the last episodes of this season. I have a feeling that so little effort was put in this because it was more of springboard for ""The Farm"" which was never picked up then an actual ending to the series. Not even Lucy Lawless could save this great series. I would have loved to have her come on as a regular character and get involved with one of the characters. The whole point of her character being there did not even answer the question that was the basis for all 8 episodes of the series.",1343088000,,712,4.242647058823529
3590410,4,B001G0MFOM,"I really want to give this maybe even 3 stars, but I really love this show and I know a lot of people might think my rating is for the whole series, but this is just for the FINAL SEASON.

There were so many things left unanswered. It felt rushed, there weren't even enough episodes for the last season. IT IS THE FINAL SEASON!!! And it has less episodes than even last season? What is this? The L Word is one of the best shows I have ever seen in my entire life, and midway it felt rushed. Even after new problems arose, they were never answered. Just nothing. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I just want to say I can't believe (POSSIBLE SPOILER ON DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTER) how I hated Jenny's guts by the end of this series. I really liked Jenny until about Season 5 where she became snobby and then she kept ruining everybody's lives and in everyone's business. Even making Shane crazy who is her best friend and the most relaxed character.

And I must say, Bette Porter is the best character in this whole series. They are all wonderful characters, they are all well rounded, but even though I felt like Bette Porter or even Shane should have been the face of the L word, the whole ending ended up being all about Jenny. And in a VERY bad way.

As for the WHOLE SERIES, I just loved this show. Their friendship was so real, they did everything together and had each others backs. They went to every event together, talked about everything. If I were to ever have a big circle of friends, I'd love to have a group as great as they were. No TV show has had this type of friendship, and between women. Actually the drama was just about right between all the women, because it's true LOL!

I must say, the sex scenes were basically like soft core, and you saw ever character naked, and you got so use to them being naked that it was no big deal. EVERYTHING showed. It actually got annoying for me, they would sleep with each other so fast LOL.

It just sucks there will never be another show like this. It was also pulled prematurely.

My PET PEEVE about this show however is the infidelity. Even the character's you didn't think would cheat, they do. Even your favorite ones!

The best seasons were probably season 2-4. I have SO much to say, but I really don't want to give anything away.

But if you want to see a show where there's a lots of lesbian drama, lots of sex, lots of great friendship between a circle of friends where you won't see on another show ever, watch this. I felt like I was apart of their little circle... this is the type of show where if you don't feel comfortable with yourself and you want to be alone and watch a show, you can watch this (if you're gay and in self denial). Anybody can see this show... just don't watch it with kids or your mom, or even grandma!",1333756800,4,2800,4.269811320754717

3590413,1,B001G0MFOM,"I finally rented Season 6 off of Netflix, although I had already read recaps so kind of knew what to expect.

It was worse than I imagined. I agree with many other reviewers that it started going downhill Season 4/5- definitely Season 5. The show stopped being about a dynamic, interesting, and likeable group of women, and became this strange tribute to Jenny Schecter- as if this young woman actually had the amount of power over this group of ladies that she was portrayed to have in Season 6? None of the characters' actions or reactions make sense by this time. Season 5 I quickly lost interest in; as it was already pointed in this direction, sadly.

Ilene Chaiken has certainly lost the respect of many fans with what she chose to do to the show and how she chose to end it. I believe that she is as delusional as the doomed Jenny Schecter, and really, I wonder if that is the character she most identified with. If so- no need to explain further.

I refuse to view Season 6 as actually happening, and while I am at it, I'm going to just leave the world of the L-Word at Season 4. And hey, in my world, Carmen and Shane get back together :)",1327536000,,1147,4.325581395348837

I've never seen straight actors portray lesbians so effectively.  The chemistry between Bette and Tina was absolutely amazing.  The sex scenes were totally believable.  The emotion that Jennifer Beals and Laurel Holloman were able to evoke speaks volumes about their acting abilities.  The other actors were very talented as well but I guess because Bette and Tina were my favorites I'm partial.  I hope Ilene Chaiken, the creator, will pursue another series along the same lines.  It was awsome that Showtime backed the project and I have a new admiration for their boldness and the chance they took.  I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed the show.  And my personal opinion is that Jenny killed herself because she realized how much she had alienated herself, especially if Shane had confronted her, which we never saw.",1327276800,,992,4.845238095238095

The character has been completely unlikeable for years; honestly, I'm surprised that she wasn't done in long before this.

And for being the last season, there is no closure.  The last show in the season is especially weak.  And the whole big mystery around Jenny's death is never solved, either, in case anyone actually cares.

Sorry to put it that way, but in my opinion the writers blew it.  Season 5's pacing was all off, characters were disjointed and seemed lost.  Plus what is with this single white female thing?  Come on...you actually pulled a Jenny Schecter on your own show and couldn't come up with anything original?

Than we get to season 6 and it didn't get better, it got worse.  You had only 8 episodes to fix the mess that was season 5 and instead of giving us a decent original ending you went for the old ""Who Shot J.R."" paradigm?  Seriously?  Plus, as many others have all ready said, you had the characters all over the place doing uncharacteristic things which took this show to a whole new low.

Sorry to say this as well, but, the last two seasons was a total disgrace and dishonor to the GLBT community.  You managed to make it seem like we're all crazy, driven by sex, untrustworthy, and incapable of making commitments.  Just horrible writing, and unoriginal drivel, and the finale...total garbage.  My cat can puke up hairballs with more originality than the stuff you gave us.

I sat and watched the season 5 and season 6 episodes with my girlfriend and was telling her what would happen long before they would happen.  Why was I able to do this?  Because it was that unoriginal, we'd seen these stories before in other shows!

After season 4 I think the writers and producer were only in it for the money and could careless what they did with the show, the characters, and the story.  If anyone else is planning on getting this series I would highly recommend only getting the first 4 season and do not even bother watching season 5 or 6.

The second aspect of season 6 that was disappointing is that the entire season revolved around Jenny.  I think the consesus is out, Jenny is nothing but frustrating...so I don't know why the entire final season revolves around Jenny.

2) Nikki said, in the manner of a guilty confession ""Guys, she was keeping all of you prisoner in this house!""
3) Shane ordered Nikki to shut up, probably to prevent Nikki from implicating and incriminating herself.

I can imagine that writing a TV show is hard work.  Even with a great idea, like this show, as the series goes on you inevitably get trapped in by the history of the characters and events that have taken place.  I guess the challenge for good writers is to be able to deal with this and still create compelling TV.  I think that this was too much for the L word writers, however.

3590603,1,B001G0MFOM,"I am highly disappointed in The L Word Final Season. I watched originally on Showtime with great expectation especially for the last episode. I don't know what happened to the show. The truth is, it was never the same since the creators decided to cut Dana out, after that they barely hung on - but the show was still entertaining. The Final Season however was just plain bad.

First, I don't care if you have gender dysphoria - just because you take hormones does not mean you automatically turn into the opposite sex, and therefore your sex organs no longer work according to their original settings. Max's whole ""Oh I didn't think I could get pregnant"" was an insult to people facing this issue, as well as an insult to a character who supposedly is intelligent enough to create complex IT programs, but apparently didn't get 4th grade biology. Girls and boys, penis and vagina equals baby, even if the penis is gay and the vagina is confused. So...girls and boys, put a rubber on it and move on. Having Max become pregnant was just plain cheesy, especially since the plot was created only shortly after the idiocy of the ""pregnant man"" story. Good job creators, you took a break through character, and screwed it up.

Second, yes Jenny needed to die - but was it necessary to make ME want to be the killer? The character was already annoying to began with, and the majority of The Final Season was basically ""The Jenny Show"" and ""How will Jenny make me want to kill her today?? hmmm."" Tedious.

Third...Shane should have grown up. Brian Kinney of Queer as Folk was a much better written character than Shane, and even he grew up in the end. I personally did not see any growth in any of the characters apart from Helena.

Finally...how dare you not re-introduce the entire cast when they say goodbye? I didn't see Carmen, Marina, or Dana in the final ""good bye shots."" Carmen and Marina showed up in a tape made by Jenny, which begs the question...why didn't Marina just come back and take Jenny? That would have been a better rap up of the show.

Overall, I personally hated this season. The best (and it's a stretch) that can be said for this season, is the last episode where Tina and Bette are sitting at the porch, and we see Shane walking back home supposedly from another night (just as in the very first episode). It was bittersweet, and a good reminder of just how good The L Word ONCE was.",1258243200,6,2403,4.514942528735633
3590604,4,B001G0MFOM,"I loved The L Word from day one; great characters, great arcs, great story lines and lots of spice.

Each character had a uniqueness about them.  Especially the two I mention here: Alice was a complete delight (Leisha's craft in delivery was flawless).  Jenny's character was indeed complex.  You just loved hating her at certain points.  But I did hate to see her go.

What I did find lacking was a bit more realism in body types.  I, as an overweight lesbian, loved seeing the beauty in these women but the lack of people with weight issues should have been addressed.

I disagreed with the writers regarding Dana's demise.  She should have represented hope and the love for life.  We know people die from breast cancer and the devastation that surrounds it but I believe it would have been a better story line showing Dana rising above and having a positive attitude toward the disease and the lessons learned and what she possibly could do to help others.  I write this from witnessing this disease through my life partner.

And then a side bar to that, since Dana did die, and having her reappear before Alice, that should have gone on periodically through the remaining seasons.  Especially, in the very last episode when everyone was saying their good-byes...her ghost-like appearance could have shown up.

All in all I will miss my fix of The L Word.",1258243200,2,1358,4.6991525423728815
3590605,5,B001G0MFOM,"fantastic ending to a great series.  A ""who done it?"" with a confusing ending.  Lives up to the L word series expectation of excellence.  one problem is it is way too short, that is not a full season was shot.  too bad, not enough of a great thing.",1258243200,2,248,4.104166666666667
3590606,2,B001G0MFOM,"The L word has been a guilty pleasure of mine for a number of years, but season 5 dragged along and I feared the worst for season 6. Turns out it was far worst then anything I could imagine.
Ilene and Co. had planned on season 5 to be the last season, which is why the last episode of that season feels... odd. However, she managed to talk Showtime into allowing a final season. This was a short season and the intention was to give a proper farewell but, of course, Ilene bumbles and fails in many, many ways.

This season Ilene tried to ""listen to the fans"". You say you don't like Jenny? We'll kill her! You say you want Shane and Jenny to hook up? Done! You liked Helen and Dylan? She's BACK! etc, etc
Ilene takes these ideas, that could have been good (minus the killing jenny thing) and ruins them. Also keep in mind the season is only eight episodes, does Ilene REALLY have time to write a Bette and Tina a story line where they are adopting a baby? Or Max dealing with pregnancy? Or Kit falling in a drugged fantasy land? Or... you get my point. Instead of wrapping up story lines, she unravels more and more.

You have to take a step back and wonder why do we watch this show? Because of the main characters and the bond of friendship that ties them all together. That is why we love watching this show and watching *some* of the characters grow over the years. I would have loved to see it end on a positive note, them all sitting around at The Planet, for the most part happy, the way the series started. Instead we have an over-dramatic police confessional and mystery killer.

I understand why Ilene did it. She wanted a spin-off television show to reveal the mystery, or perhaps a movie deal to dig deeper into what really happened, or a clothing line that slowly, through cryptic symbols, shows ""what really happened"". Bottom line, Ilene got greedy and tried to manipulate the ending to work in her financial favor. But there is no spin-off and very unlikely a movie (who would watch it after this anyway?), so one has to wonder, what was the point? I appreciate what Ilene has done, the first tv show about lesbians, a HUGE step in the right direction. I can forgive her for a lot of things and a lot of grievances I have with the writing. But Ilene has a responsibility to these characters, she has a responsibility to be true to them and to end what she began with some amount of decency.
After season six was over, all I could think was, ""good, I was sick of it anyway."" I still watch season 1 fondly, while trying to forget season 6 ever even happened.",1257811200,7,2572,4.331950207468879
3590607,4,B001G0MFOM,The final season had alot of unanswered questions and could continue for more seasons. I am bothered that some many questions were left unanswered. But if your a fan its ok.,1257638400,,173,4.612903225806452
3590608,4,B001G0MFOM,"I might not have purchased this final season had I accepted the negative reactions I've read.  Now that I've just finished watching it, I feel the series has had a satisfying conclusion which included seeing, if only briefly, characters from the past.  (The Dylan storyline could have been much better thought out, though.)

The over-the-top marketing about ""Who Killed Jennie?"" put the wrong slant on the final series as I don't believe she was killed.  The better question to have asked as a framing device for the season would have been ""Who was Jennie?"" As Bette said, she was complex.",1256342400,,589,4.86

I have never been hooked on a series but this one [...] me in and when I reached the end of the final episode I felt that my best friend had dropped into a black hole. Well, not really, but what acting what direction and I don't care who killed Jenny. Life and this series aren't always neat. I'm really going to miss Shane's character. Complex. Aren't we all? What's with these whiners who are giving the show a bad rating just because they don't know who killed Jenny. The point was everyone wanted her dead and in that tightly knit group it didn't matter who did the deed. Maybe that was the point.",1251158400,8,734,4.287769784172662
3590652,1,B001G0MFOM,"I wonder if the writers of this season, knowing that they needed new jobs, took on other tasks to which they directed the majority of their creativity and talent? They certainly didn't put much into finishing what they had started so well, but then the slide didn't start with the last season. The 5th season had moved increasingly toward more sex and less plot. When that had gone as far as it could, it bombed out completely with the unsolved murder mystery of season 6. I think the decline started as far back as season four.

After the success of the first three seasons, they increasingly replaced character exploration with plot dependant vignettes.  Characters served the plot no matter how that violated who you thought they were. Events became unpredictable and seemed to exist simply for their shock value. To me, really good writing explores subtle emotions and employs enough foreshadowing to keep the audience thinking. I don't mind being shocked on occasion, but when it happens too often and is accompanied by a bundle of short plotlines, distraction replaces enjoyment.

L Word peppered its content with many topics, gender change, promiscuity, breast cancer, military regulations, older women coming out, infidelity and alcoholism. The series covered a lot of serious issues, but often, especially toward the end, placed too many competing issues in one show. Over the last three seasons and especially the last two, I found that the plotlines had fallen to the level of quick, unsatisfying vignettes.

In the end what I remember from L Word are caricatures rather than characters and a lot of busy plots. Is it any wonder that its swan song, season six, was a silly murder mystery peppered with flashbacks and completely lacking in substance?",1250899200,10,1760,5.017123287671233

I loved every minute of the 1st season, then the 2nd season turned me off due to Jenny's ugly haircut, the the 3rd season really made me mad because of Dana's death. The 4th season was just boring to me. In the 5th season, I got real tired of seeing the endless love scenes. When Six came around, I realized it was my favorite season since the first and I loved it. Personally, I think that Jenny committed suicide. I mean, she was a human car crash. I will definitely miss this drama.",1250553600,3,548,4.083333333333333
3590654,5,B001G0MFOM,"Oh dear what negativety regarding the Final Season!  Hence my reason to write a small but apt review!  In my wee opinion I do think the show did a grand job with the Final Season and with all good productions outthere leaving the viewers with questions about who killed Jenny and the highs and lows in each of the characters lives was about treating the audience with intelligence and respect! Well done Actor's Encore! Encore! Yes it was fiction however the writers did a grand job in depicting a wide gamut of life events and experiences similar to our own real lifes including such great funny moments!  Most importantly the way the production ended in my opinion leaves the opportunity for another production to be made in the future something of which I am sure all the fans would welcome! Hello! when each of the characters smiled as they walked towards the police station in my opinion told us that neither of them were guilty it was actually Jennys pet poodle! Watch the show again and you will see the evidence throughout the seasons! Happy watching, reviewing, rewinding and enjoying!  This show was an all time success and I am sure it will be back to your shores again in the future the evidence is already out there.",1250294400,2,1229,4.623853211009174

However, if you keep in mind that this whole season was still entertaining, it was just more of a WTF shock value entertainment.  It completes the TV SERIES of this amazing show.  But season six just reaks of a forshawdowing of a possible movie followup that answers all the questions that season 6 leaves open.  Even if it wasn't like Sex and the City where it hits the big screen, it could still echo Prison Break and just go strait to DVD.  Who knows, this may not happen and then we are truly just left with a shi--y ending but it completes one of the best series ever so I'll still recommend buying it.  But I do seriously see them trying to make a little more money by redoing this ending.

3590657,1,B001G0MFOM,"Jenny dies in the final episode but questions such as who killed Jenny and how did Jenny die are never answered.  That's only the beginning of the final season's many letdowns.  The truth is, I hated everything about this season.  With only 8 X 1 hour episodes, there was no time to waste; but this is exactly what happens.  The majority of the storylines from this season come across as tedious, pointless and cumbersome.  Also, I could have done without the 2 added characters, Kelly and Helena's ex-girlfriend Dylan.  Both were annoying and their scenes felt like wasted airtime to me.  There were too many plot holes and the writing came across as clumsy and amatuerish.  IMO, the real killer is Ilene Chaiken.  Ilene killed Jenny and the series.  We later learned the idea behind Jenny's death was so there could be a spin-off, ""The Farm"" with Leisha Haily who played Alice from the show.  The premise of the spin-off was that Alice goes to prison for killing Jenny.  Well with no spin-off, what are the fans left with?  A huge mess of what used to to be one of cable TV's greatest guilty pleasures.  The final season was so bad it leaves a bad lasting impression of the series.  It certainly outraged and disappointed many of the show's fans.  Shame on you Ilene.",1244246400,29,1269,4.598214285714286
3590658,5,B001G0MFOM,"I was really intrigued by the story line and for the idea that Jenny gets killed off. She was a girl from the mid west, come out to the west to venture a new life with her boyfriend, fiancee, ex husband then to have realized her sexuality isn't what she had thought because of her misconstrued nature of life.  she was an excellent character, and she acted very well, she was the one character that i just wanted to pull her hair off, not just chop it off.
I loved the story line with Bette and Tina, and i'm glad to see them back together again.
Shane wished she had Carmen come back into her life, but instead went crazy for Jenny.
Alice should not have shared her idea with Jenny, already knowing how caniving and devious Jenny is.  But there is, and always will be a character you will have to base who is the good guy, and who is the bad guy in order to know the difference between the two. Tasha is excellent.
I don't know what's running through Max's head.
Helena, i despise that she wanted to return to Danny's girlfriend. Boo on that part.
Overall story line, honestly with the time that was permitted, the budget they were limited, was very excellent, only because they had intended to have a spin-off. Which i do hope the spinoff makes it to television, and not just online.
The L word was and is, always going to be a monumental historical epic for lesbians and bisexuals and transexuals in televison entertainment. I heart the L word!!!",1240444800,13,1449,4.402985074626866
3590659,2,B001G0MFOM,"Ok...where do i start? Well the 6th season of the l word i think was a HUGE waste of time. Not only did they spend too much time on characters that weren't going anywhere as far as storyline. And they didn't spend enough time finishing up the story lines with great characters (ie. Bette and Tina.) which were probably the only characters in the end that you could take seriously. I found myself wanting to fast forward too many parts through out this season that were just a waste of airtime. *spoiler* I don't believe anyone killed Jenny. If you watched the series from the beginning, its just not in any of the girls to kill anyone. It would be sooo out of character.*
As far as the characters this season, they felt rushed, no depth anymore, no wedding,no really good cameos, nothing.

Alice: Funny as usual, great character.

Shane: Apparently she went insane this season and decided to date jenny and not believe any of her friends.

Kit: No depth to her character anymore, just a few ""kittisms"".

Helena: WHY was she in this season! wasn't she a strong working woman at
the very beginning? they turned her into a character with no point.

Max: IC turned Max into a joke this season. No depth to the character. once again, rushed.

Bette: Still the same strong character from season 1, she's actually grown as a person and she shows it in season 6. great job with her.

Tina: More of a stronger person this season. Her scenes with Bette makes the whole season 6 more interesting.

Tasha: umm what can i say. *Spoiler* the friend threesome thing was a very bad story line. IC trying to bring drama into places it shouldnt be. Why cant these characters just be happy?

Jenny: soooo Rushed. Season 6 made Jenny look like she really went crazy. We all knew she was a little off. But she just turned out to be a Snob,whiny, and sometimes acted like a 5 yr old.

*spoiler* Nothing was answered in season 6. Every character was left in the dark about something. And this show did not end with a bang like it should have. season 1-5 are great! but season 6 was just a waste of airtime and a lot of disapointment.

I thought it was my Roku.  So I rebooted the Roku and still.  I tried to reboot it again.  No luck.
Then I tried to watch it in my browser on my computer and it plays back the same way, BADLY.  I wish Amazon would fix this episode, it's very annoying to watch everything in stop-motion.  Apparently the video on the Amazon server is messed up.  This is the only one to do this so far.
