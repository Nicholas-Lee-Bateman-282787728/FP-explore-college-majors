4574011,5,B0055E64FQ,I thought this movie offered a great summary of what our challenges are and potential ways we could address them. The ideas are supported by facts and people taking real actions to bring about change. If you want a quick overview of what is not only going on but how we can create green jobs this is a great starting point.,1327449600,11,323,4.311475409836065
4574012,5,B0055E64FQ,"This documentary is unique in its genre (climate change & green energy) in that it is very positive and solution-oriented. There is minimal alarmism, scant blame, no preaching, avoidance of controversy, and they even claim it doesn't matter whether or not you believe climate change is anthropogenic (caused by humans).

In 80 minutes, they breeze through CO2, climate change, receeding glaciers, water shortage, pine borer beetles, wind energy, solar photovoltaic, ethanol, algae biodiesel, geothermal, carbon sequestration, land use, deforestation, electric cars, electricity storage in car batteries, carbon taxes, green buildings, roof gardens, rain catchment, green jobs, conservation, efficiency, freon, recycling, white roofs, and more.

So much is covered that it is necessarily just a cursory overview. If you listen closely, there's a lot of concepts and a lot of numbers, although they just fly by in a feel-good manner. A few of the numbers (for savings) sounded too good to be true, but that's not the point. The point is that there are lots of solutions and we just need to get busy, both personally and politically.

Talking heads include such recognizable figures as Amory Lovins (Rocky Mtn Institute), James Woolsey (CIA), Richard Branson (Virgin Air), and quite a lot of Van Jones (Green Collar Economy).

The deleted scenes are also well worth watching.

The thankfully-brief cartoon portions put me off a bit but do convey their messages.

It quickly skims over alarming trends like China's huge expansion of coal-fired power plants and the challenge of rising living standards for BRIC (Brazil/Russia/India/China).

It acknowledges the controversy over whether nuclear power is ""green"" but only cites radioactive waste disposal as an issue. Here I digress: They don't mention un-insurability (we taxpayers promise to foot the bill for accidents!), catastrophic melt down (Fukushima, Chernobyl, & almost 3 Mile Island), radioactive liquid & gas leakage (frequent on a small scale), corrosion in buried pipes, embodied energy in construction (taking many years to output more energy than that used in construction), energy required to mine & enrich uranium ore, cost & ongoing-maintenance of permanent decommissioning, etc. (Nuclear power is uneconomical without taxpayer subsidy.)

It acknowledges the problems of corn ethanol including: subsidies, petrochemical inputs, raising world food prices, clearing forests to compensate for land used, overall inefficiency, and unsuitability for diesels & aviation. The comparative efficiencies of sugar cane, palm oil, and algae were surprising.

The overall theme is to avoid controversy and focus on positive and economically-profitable changes that we can agree upon and begin right now.

Please watch this, so we can all vote, buy, and behave for our common good on this tiny lifeboat planet Earth.",1325808000,22,2865,5.56551724137931
4574013,1,B0055E64FQ,"An extreme one sided presentation of global warming alarmism and crazy energy schemes. Features long time environmental radicals like Lester Brown, Van Jones and Armory Lovins. Takes a patronizing attitude toward  featured ""regular guys"" who supposedly benefit from windmills, etc. The regular guys use profanity to make them seem more regular. Makes all kinds of unsubstantiated statements blaming every bad weather event on climate change being here now.

Everthing in this movie is pretty much a lie.",1319068800,7,503,5.51948051948052
4574014,4,B0055E64FQ,"I had actually watched this movie in the theater but also wanted to own a copy of the DVD.  What I like in particular about this climate-change documentary-style movie, is the positive outlook.  The movie doesn't point fingers.  Instead it focuses on solutions we can do to help the environment.  What I liked is that the solutions are being implemented now, are typically low-cost, and show collaboration at the local level.  No matter what level you're at, the movie points out steps you can take to positively impact the environment.",1317254400,18,536,4.911111111111111

4574046,2,B0055E64FQ,"I would love to watch an honest film about new energy technology--one that looks at the good and the bad in an unbiased way.  This is not that film.

If you want to watch a guilt-trip, preachy, biased, and littered with fringe science film then watch this.  They throw out dooms-day catastrophes and then say ""it could happen"" and ""if we do nothing you bet it will happen"".

If you can ignore the ""save the planet"" preaching throughout the movie, you do learn about some interesting techniques some folks are using to be more efficient in fuel consumption--which just makes financial sense.  As an engineer myself I am all about lean thinking efficiency.

They end with basically promoting a carbon tax on fuel...artificially making carbon fuel more expensive.  That way wind and solar can actually compete with natural oil and gas.  They do not point out any of the drawbacks of hiking up fuel costs nationwide based on environmental models that have proven to be less than accurate.

4574057,3,B0055E64FQ,"This movie initially runs through many popular and easily understood concepts about climate change, dismissing controversy to get to its point: We can and should reduce our carbon footprint. Then, it turns into a documentary of green business models in the US that are working or at least look promising.

4574063,3,B0055E64FQ,"Peter Byck appeared on the Bill Maher show to promote Carbon Nation and did an excellent job of portraying the necessity of energy and infrastructure changes in order to help the sustainability of not just the environment, but also the economy. Unfortunately, the film itself lacks the emotional appeal of Byck's appearance and fails to make the concise pitch that Byck does. The film doesn't know whether it wants to about a green economy or about saving the environment, and if it's trying to be both, it fails to coalesce around a successfully spelled-out succinct theme. From a production standpoint, it severely lacks the effective emotional appeal and relate-ability of a documentary such as Food, Inc.

Despite criticisms about the production of the film, the content of the film is important, timely and extremely necessary for modern humanity to understand. Green solutions and CleanTech are not only vital to the sustainability of energy and the environment, but it provides an opportunity to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States and abundantly increase service-related jobs as well. In addition to addressing needed steps to reduce carbon output, Carbon Nation also discusses the concept of carbon sequestration, and how humanity could actually reduce the currently high levels of carbon in the atmosphere.

Although flaws persist in many aspects of this documentary, the message it delivers is an important one, and this is a film that everyone should watch, if only to continue the discussion and debate solutions.",1357776000,3,1541,5.260162601626016

8458159,4,B0055E64FQ,"Taking on a growing challenge like fossil fuels after many other films on the topic have been released takes some creativity.  Here, the viewer takes a tour around the U.S. to see who is dealing with the carbon problem.  Just as the problem has many aspects, the solutions are multi-faceted and numerous as well.

One of the more convincing guest speakers is James Woolsey.  Here we see the connection between carbon dependence and national security.  Currently, in December 2014, there is are temporarily lower oil prices.  This is an excellent time to break away from $100/barrel oil and develop alternatives - think of an energy program at a national level that Jimmy Carter would have created.

A recent dilemma is that gas shale fracking provides some energy security and a degree of locally cleaner air but at a high pollution burden to small towns and downriver cities.  This particular issue is one that Woolsey and similarly minded folks will need to address over time:  not only is gas shale fracking causing permanent groundwater pollution, leaks in the gas system at four percent (4%) or over make natural gas as bad or worse than coal (see James Lovelock's ""The Vanishing Face of Gaia"").  There are far better ways to achieve sustainable energy independence.",1417996800,,1271,4.952830188679245
