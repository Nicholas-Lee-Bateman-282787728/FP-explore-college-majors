8271763,5,B00193WVK4,"In Sync with Cindy is an excellent way for older folks like me to get out of the fitness rut. The video isn't easy, but I think anyone who's capable of walking two or three blocks would be able to handle it after a few weeks. I say few weeks because Cindy, in the beginning of the video, recommends using it 2 times weekly to begin. I think after you get ""into"" it she recommends 3 times a week. In any case, it isn't hard or I wouldn't be doing it because I'm basically lazy. I wanted to buy it on DVD so I can take it along when we go RVing, but I can't afford the prices I've seen online so far. I'll keep looking at garage sales (where I bought the 2 tapes I have).",1344038400,,669,3.8905109489051095
