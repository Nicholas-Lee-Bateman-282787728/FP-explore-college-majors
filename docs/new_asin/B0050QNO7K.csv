4517926,5,B0050QNO7K,"Absolutely superb stories, delivered most dramatically through the viewpoint (initially) of beloved pets.
Its great to see the interaction of not only when ghosts affect people, but when they affect animals. They are seen as guardians and it would be terrifying if we could see what they see (and feel!).
Each story is intricately interlaced with actual paranorml footage (video and EVP) investigations, worthy re-enactments and actual interviews of the families involved. If you liked the 'A Haunting series 1-4' then you'll love these fantastic true stories. A nice twist and different angle to standard ghost documentaries.
The only sad part is some of the animals are severely affected which is not nice to see, but its no different I guess to 'anything' a demonic entity chooses to attack.
A 'must add' to your collection!",1317859200,5,827,5.133333333333334
4517927,3,B0050QNO7K,"This is a good set to have if you're into paranormal goings-on.  This series, which I believe is a spin-off of the ""A Haunting"" series (which is NOT based on Animal Planet), is pretty good.  I still feel the storytelling and reenactments are better in the A Haunting series.  If you are going to buy just one of the two, get A Haunting and forgo this one.  The A Haunting ones are scarier and creepier, too!",1316995200,2,407,4.315789473684211
4517928,5,B0050QNO7K,"Great show, but first a caution of different dvd version releases, not adequately described. There are at least 2 versions out there with much different content and value.

I give the 10 episode dvd release (selling for $14) 4 and a half to 5 stars. Since you can't give 1/2 ratings, lets's say 5 stars. This review is for this item.

The 5 star release has a cover with an adorable (yeah, I know) pit bull with beautiful worried looking eyes, looking over his shoulder at paranormal light coming in a window. This is the 5-star release to buy.

The 3 episode dvd (selling for up to $20) is the one NOT to buy.
(It has a different dog on the cover--a Irish Setter or Labrador-type dog.)

I very much like this series, and would rate the content and entertainment value of the series and episodes very highly. They are somewhat dramatized and scary presentations of described true occurances.
The episodes use interviews with the actual people involved, film and show you the actual locations, play actual video and EVPs recorded during the hauntings (if they exist), and are well presented and thought thru. It uses dramatic recreations, using actors, for some events, but this adds to the tension and chill factor that many people look for in these type shows. The people under paranormal attack usually had called in the local paranormal investigative group, or someone, to help and these actual people are interviewed in the episodes about their experiences, too. So, the shows provides a good balance to both those looking only to be entertained, but also, to those trying to understand more detailed answers. Each episode has a different set of people, and a different investigative group, so this adds variety, scope, and changing scenes.
 Animal Planet tries to tie each haunting into some connection with animals, as the series was made for Animal Planet. For some episodes, there are extensive involvment of animals (pets or farm animals), some less so, but so what--they are good cases. Each episode is about an hour long (less commercial time). Many episodes present 2 different cases at different locations, some just one.
They are very good entries into the contempory universe of Ghost/ Paranormal shows, playing on TV.

Wikipedia lists 20 episodes for Season 1, with season 2 playing on cable right now (late 2011). The current 10 episode release is the first half of season 1--in order.
I assume we will see the second half of Season 1 on a separate dvd release (also 10 episodes) at some future point in 2012 ?

The series is very enjoyable, well-presented, with a high believability factor. If you like paranormal TV shows, this one is a keeper.",1316822400,25,2663,4.826754385964913
4517929,5,B0050QNO7K,"This is a terrific show.  I used to love to watch ""A Haunting"" on Discovery Channel, so when the show got canceled I was pretty bummed out. Since then there have been numerous paranormal shows on TV, but this is my current favorite one.  It is shown on Animal Planet, and although the show is supposed to focus on animals affected by the paranormal, that really is only one small part of the show.  The re-enactments are great and I think the producers do a terrific job with capturing the right atmosphere with each episode.  So if you are a fan of the paranormal and enjoy these types of programs, definitely go ahead and pick this DVD up...it is definitely well worth it!!",1316822400,2,675,4.463414634146342
4517930,5,B0050QNO7K,"These are must see stories.  If you like the series A Haunting, then these are similar and quite detailed.  I do hope they have a second season.  Each story shows how animals sense or are affected by something paranormal.",1316736000,2,221,4.615384615384615
4517931,5,B0050QNO7K,I loveeeee this show! I watched it every day. They stopped showing it on tv so I watched it on Netflix but they also took it off there so I HAD to have the dvd. Also ordered the other seasons.,1431561600,,192,3.825
4517932,5,B0050QNO7K,"Love this series!!  Don't know why Animal Planet doesn't still make this show, but it's seriously creepy and great.  Animal lovers, this is a show for you!",1415059200,,155,4.703703703703703

4517936,5,B0050QNO7K,"This series of stories is told very well. Authentic, realistic, interviews with actual 'victims'; it really draws you in to the nightmares these people - and pets - experienced. I fully expected to giggle my way through these true stories since I am not a believer in this kind of thing. Uh... no... I'm ashamed to say I was really scared watching most of them. In fact after I watched the first disc, I decided I would not watch the other disc unless it was daytime. How silly that must sound.  :D  You'll really like The Haunted, I think.",1389657600,,540,4.444444444444445
4517937,5,B0050QNO7K,"I have just seen the first season of this great serie and I must admit that I had no idea that Animal Planet sent programmes that dealt with the paranormal. That was a surprise to me. But a nice surprise since it combined two of my favourite subjects. I love animals and I'm very interested in the paranormal. This serie is not as frightening as A Haunting from Discovery Channel. These two series a very much alike each other, but A Haunting is a little bit scarrier than The Haunted. That is not a serie I want to see when it has turned dark outside. Series that I also can recommend are Paranormal State, Ghost Hunters, Psychic Kids and Ghost Adventures. There are two series that I'm not that fond of. The first one is the Brittish Most Haunted. Some of the investigators make me nervous with all their screaming and yelling. And that is very annoying. The second serie that I don't like is the Swedish The Unknown. It is too boring. !0 minutes into the show you have fallen asleep, and I don' t think that is the idea with the programe. That it will work as a sleeping pill. Paranormal series that I like the most are the ones that are informative, interesting and serious about the subject. And not the ones that are too noisy or those that are too boring. The Haunted are one of the best series. It is interesting, scary and tragic. Some of the animals didn't survive their encounters with the unknown at that made me very sad. But I hope they found peace on the other side.",1373760000,,1481,4.369565217391305
4517938,4,B0050QNO7K,Is a good DVD set good picture and price.  It fits into the true haunting category but with a bit of a twist to how animals sense things.,1362182400,,137,3.892857142857143
4517939,5,B0050QNO7K,I was a bit apprehensive about ordering this.  I have ordered many DVDs on hauntings and found them to be repetitive.  I wanted to watch something that I have not watched many times before or that is just not interesting to watch.  I was quite pleased to find this DVD.,1360540800,,269,4.34
4517940,5,B0050QNO7K,"The dvd arrived promptly,was everything I hoped it would be....I was given notification of it's arrival, and I absolutely love it!!! Great topic for those interested in the supernatuaral!!",1359244800,,188,5.517241379310345
4517941,4,B0050QNO7K,"The Haunted series is probably my most favorite one to watch stories on.  Not only do I think the acting is top notch, but the way the stories are depicted  as if you were in the middle of it all is superb! Four and a half stars is more like what I would rate it, but I don't see an option for that.",1356739200,,299,3.7301587301587302
4517942,4,B0050QNO7K,I was very interested in how animals can sense strange things where humans can't. Animals are amazing and we humans should take more notice of them and their abilities.,1355270400,,168,4.827586206896552
4517943,5,B0050QNO7K,"These are really great. They remind me alot of the discovery channels A Haunting. Good stories, good acting, and sometimes downright creepy.",1353110400,,140,5.409090909090909
4517944,5,B0050QNO7K,"great dvd,lots of cool scary stories,and even thou it's suppose to be about animals,(run on animal planet network)..there really wasn't much there..mostly haunted places,people,and things that go bump in the night..the stories are about 40 min long each..and really well done,and SCARY!!..great back stories,interviews..ect..so if you like the ""a haunting series""..this might be something to watch..well worth the money...thou they do show alot of the reruns on their network..but the dvd is great to have around..for that 3rd or 4th date..when you want a good excuses,to get touchy,feely... thou it's not a B movies..it's still a keeper...",1352073600,,640,5.608247422680412
4517945,5,B0050QNO7K,"More great stories about the paranormal, but these let us know how smart our animals are and the credit and attention we do not justly give them for seeing, and hearing what we don;t. We already know that every dogs sense of smell is thousands times stronger than ours, but when we think they are staring off into space and barking or acting crazy for nothing, this will advise you to trust that it is probably something. Trust your gut and trust your pets. They don't worry about life like we do, and are way more open to what we are clueless about in this world......LISTEN TO YOUR ANIMALS!!!!!",1346544000,,596,4.477064220183486
4517946,5,B0050QNO7K,"It seems like everywhere you look today, every network has a ghost hunting show.  Bio has My Ghost Story and Celebrity Ghost Stories; A&E had Paranormal State; Discovery had the reigning king of ghostly horror with A Haunting; Travel has Ghost Adventures; and ScyFy has a plethora of Ghostbusters wannabes with Ghost Hunters, Paranormal Witness, Haunted Highways, and Ghost Lab.  It would only be a matter of time before NatGeo would jump on the ""I can feel a presence in this house"" bandwagon with the A Haunting spin-off The Haunted and I'm surprise to say that I loved this show.

What makes The Haunted stand out over the rest of these types of shows is it's unique spin on how household pets become the first to sense a particular house's uninvited guests and their attempts to try and protect their Packs.  Unfortunately, in some stories presented here, their heroic efforts wind up costing some of them their lives.

Presented here are the ten episodes as well as a few sub episodes of this amazingly heartfelt series which appears to have ended its short run of three seasons.  I normally hate it when studios divide their series seasons into only half season sets but having the first ten episodes is better than none at all.  Now all we have to do is wait for the rest of the sets to follow.  Hey, it took the WB nearly six years to finish releasing the last four seasons of its former hit drama Everwood.  It could still happen here.",1345680000,,1444,4.609375
4517947,5,B0050QNO7K,I wathced the show and found the content very interesting and entertaining. I recommend this to anyone who likes to hear stories about spooky stuff. It's worth the time to watch!,1329350400,,178,4.774193548387097
4517948,5,B0050QNO7K,"If you enjoyed the Discovery show ""A Haunting"" before it got way to overly dramatic in the later seasons, then you will LOOOVE these DVDs!

  The two series are similar, with one major difference...

  The Discovery Channels ""A Haunting"" had the people who experienced the Paranormal Phenomena telling only around 50% of the story through-out the reenactment, while the producers of the show told the other 50% for them through overly dramatic scenes in which you never heard the people who went through these events talking, leading us viewers not to know what to believe, and not knowing what was overly dramatized for the sake of television.  This is where ""The Haunted"" takes over and blows ""A Haunting"" out the water!

  ""The Haunted"" not only has the people who went through these experience tell 100% there story the entire time (as far as actually hearing them tell the story while showing reenactments while there story is being told), but they also include actual footage of ""never before seen on TV"" footage of what these people were seeing in there houses!  That's right, some of these episodes actually capture the demonic entities on video, leading to the creepiest scare you will ever encounter in a television show!

  There are also the animals which are affected by whats going on in these houses, and while the show seems to come across on the cover as mainly focusing on the animals, this is not the case, the main focus is on the people involved, with the animals being used as credible witnesses due to there behavior through out these experiences. I will say, the stories that are told of how much different these animals act when encountering these demonic entities really does put a real believability into the stories told, and in some cases these very healthy animals are actually found dead by there owners due to the stress that they are put under from these demonic entities.

  ""The Haunted"" is everything ""A Haunting"" should have been... Very believable, not to overly dramatic, and with 100% of the stories being told by the people who lived through these events, not to mention some actual footage of the what these people lived through.  The reenactments are extremely well made, the quality of the program is top notch, and also very well produced!  I have not had shivers running through my body like this since I was maybe 6 years old in a dark room with no one around me, and I'm a 30 year old man now, it's truly that freaky.

There are 10 episodes included on these 2 DVDs (with my Fav being the ""The Possession of Cassie"") with a running time of over 430 minutes (about 7 hours), you cannot beat that for the price!  I'm gonna bring these with me whenever we go camping or out to our resort house in the Country, these DVDs are something to watch with the family under the covers while eating some popcorn and sipping some hot chocolate during a thunderstorm!  As you can tell I just LOVE scaring the kids! Hehe  :)

Get These DVDs, add to cart, you can thank me later! :)",1324944000,9,3014,4.643396226415095

Don't get me wrong it's nit going to win any Emmys, but it does deliver good interesting spooky stories relating to households that have animals, it's a mix of real footage of those involved docu style, and reenactments along with real footage when there is some. It's a good show, I'll be looking for the following seasons to buy, good value for money too. 5 stars ****+",1318809600,9,631,4.223140495867769
