This is a Must watch Film , and has best quality I seen of  a Movie style on this forgotten event in history, except for the Islamic leaders in the mosques who use this event as knowledge to know what not to do next time or they are preparing with steal invasion 2017 vs. this style that almost overtook Europe until Poland and General Sobieski came to save the day with its vastly outnumbered troops, but opportune moment to save Europe ways to only be stabbed in back later by Russia and 3rd Reich joining together together to overtake Poland who just reunited after it was conquered after 1795 for over 123 years to then be re-conquered by 3rd Reich Nazi Germany and Former Soviet Union Stalin Thugs who worked together to overtake Poland.

Filling an entire high ceiling wall, the painting depicts Poland's greatest King (and army general) Jan Sobieski, as he and his comparatively small army (numbering in the tens of thousands) make final preparations   before going out to do battle against overwhelming odds  a Turkish army numbering nearly a third of a million men, outside the gates of Vienna.

That auspicious date in European history --- September 11th 1683  marked the last attempt by Islamic armies to conquer the capitols of Europe. (Rome and Paris were the next, had Vienna fallen.)

---

Every now and then I'm guided (if I didn't know better I'd say 'by coincidence') to find a great movie that never made it into theaters; this is such a film   a gripping, depiction (with terrific use of computer graphics) about the days leading up to the 'original 9-11'  of 333 years ago (the reason why suicide bombers picked September 11th).

On that date in 1683, the conquering armies of Islam, over 300,000 strong, were met, and held, and thrown back at the gates of Vienna by a much smaller army of Catholic soldiers led by a Polish king who -- in addition to having a great battle plan (hauling artillery at night, up steep hillsides shrouded in deep woods, in order to fire his big guns, with devastating impact, from a high hilltop) led his troops first in prayer to ""Jesus and his mother Mary.""

Not incidentally (as he would tell his people later) 'Good King Jan' brought with him from home a life-size replica of The Black Madonna painting (at Poland's most important shrine, Our Lady of Chestachova).  And again, at the heart of this film  the battle outcome is further assured (Catholics would say) with prayers from an Italian priest and saint, Father Marco d'Aviano; he was there at the walls of Vienna reminding the Catholic soldiers of what was at stake:  Our wives, our children, and most importantly -- the future of our Faith!

It's a terrific movie that sticks to logistical facts surrounding this one, all-important day in history  so pivotal to the future of Europe.  The film opens with the voice of a great narrator, speaking these few words (as a telescopic view of a full moon is shrouded in smoky darkness).

On September 11, 1683 Islam was at the peak of its expansion in the West.  300,000 Islamic troops, under the command of Kara Mustafa, were besieging the city they called 'The Golden Apple'  Vienna. The aim of Kara Mustafa was to lead his army on to Rome and transform the Basilica of St. Peter into a mosque.  If all of this never came about, it's due to an Italian monk, Marco d'Aviano and a Polish King, Jan Sobieski.  This is their story.

Most favorite films (and this now is one of mine!) have moments of great dialog, conveying in a few well-chosen words, what is ""really at stake here."" One such moment comes as Father Marco, works a miracle of peace, talking down a nighttime mob, carrying torches and swords, young Christian men intent on killing Father Marco's Turkish friend, Abul.  While his friend remains within the safety of his home, one of his four wives, a deaf mute girl,  goes to her knees before the mob and, with frantic hand gestures and wordless grunts, appeals for mercy  for her husband.

Father Marco holds up a crucifix and prays;  suddenly the crowd retreats, still uttering threats (We'll be back and next time you won't have a monk to protect you! We'll get you, Turk!)

Moments later, the scene shifts to inside the candle-lit home, where Marco  speaking first to to his Turkish friend's brave young wife -- says to her:  You risked your life! You shouldn't have done that!  Then turning to his friend Fr. Marco asks, gently:  Why didn't YOU (go out and) defend yourself?

ABUL:  It is Allah who decides our destiny [which is] too big to try to avoid it.

MARCO: You know, Abul . . . years ago when I was studying in the seminary, I thought a lot about how (pauses, measures his words) . . . how your god is so different from mine.  I asked myself, 'Why does God allow so many, many people to believe in a god who is not himself?'  And I realized it was so his sons could carry his light  to wherever it is needed.  After a long pause, Marco says with a warm  smile, One day Abul, you too will see the true light.

ABUL:  All lights are true, Marco.
MARCO: There is only ONE True Light, Abul . . . only one!

Did I say that this movie opens with a quote from Marc (Benjamin) Bloch  a distinguished French historian who fought for France in both World Wars and was captured and executed by the Gestapo  10 days after the D-Day invasion of Normandy  for working with the French resistance.  The quote from Bloch, so a propos this film:

Misunderstanding of the present grows, fatally, from ignorance of the past.",1459468800,5,4999,4.558426966292135
8626061,5,B00GP990OC,Historical reenaction of one of the many Muslim assaults on Europe to destroy Christianity and impose the Islamic faith by force. The Turkish Ottomans were defeated and European Christians retained their many freedoms. This was a profoundly Christian movie,1442707200,2,256,5.589743589743589
8626062,3,B00GP990OC,"I found this in an obscure  pile of movies in a version that was ok for USA dvd players. I tried to find an affordable one on Amazon but after the severe bashing by professional movie critics you are lucky to find this movie anywhere. Probably already on the way to a cult classic. The performances were not spectacular and the movie tends to embrace a reconcilliatory theme between Muslims and Christians with the portrayal of the Monk and the mute girl and her much older Muslim husband. Unless you know a little about History, this movie could have used more explanation of some of the details of the day. The Poles with their most holy icon, ""The Black Madonna"" and what it means to the soul of the Polish nation. How the intense rivalry between empires other than France and Austria existed and the perceived insult to the Austrian Monarch in the aftermath of the victory seeded new problems. The Polish forces are not realistically protrayed. The lances of the Hussaria were closer to 20 feet long that the much shorter length in the movie. Their formations were so tight and formidable due to years of training for both riders and horses and in the film they charged like a bunch of recently saddled mustangs. The Polish forces of the period were so close in resemblance to the Ottomans that they had to have the Poles decorate their uniforms with straw in certain places for the other forces to discern Poles from Turks. The Janizaries were an important element in this seige and they aren't given even one scene. The Poles did not do so well in the aftermath as they pursued the Muslim army. I suppose the performance by F. Murray Abraham was not enough to redeem the shortcommings, but he did a great job as the Monk. I have been looking for other movies he is in now.",1407888000,10,1778,4.538940809968848
