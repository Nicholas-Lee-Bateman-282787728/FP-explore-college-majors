3903514,3,B002C4JUQC,"The basic plot is similar to John Candy's Summer Rental - local rich investor tries to bully a frustrated renter and renter rallies locals.

It does have a '70's look to it and Richard Egan and Dina Merrill, but it is mired in complicated relationship, environmental issues, government corruption, and shady business story lines which dilutes the movie.

It would be interesting if this was rough draft for the 1985 movie.

Look out for  Philip Baker Hall, library cop Lt. Bookman from Seinfeld.",1401494400,2,495,4.927710843373494
3903515,4,B002C4JUQC,"I thought I could get my hubby a navy vet interested in all the old movies by showing him ones like this, even though I didn't remember seeing it before, I don't think he would give it 4 stars. Lol",1397260800,,197,3.95
3903516,1,B002C4JUQC,The movie is not worth the time to watch the credits let alone the movie. Skip this dog. Bow wow.,1390608000,2,97,3.9
3903517,1,B002C4JUQC,"My English teacher from high school was in this movie, Connie Foster. She was a great actress but the movie is awful.",1384560000,,117,4.363636363636363
3903518,2,B002C4JUQC,This film's only value is as a historic artifact of a time best forgotten.  Why was it made? What were they thinking?,1376006400,,117,4.318181818181818
3903519,5,B002C4JUQC,"This is one of the worst movies I ever bought and I knew that when I bought it. The reason I purchased this movie is because the actor Edwin Hugh ""Mr Kats"" was a good friend of mine. We worked together at Walt Disney World in the Fife & Drum Corps for several years. He was a very talented actor. He pasted away in 1979.",1364256000,6,320,3.9384615384615387
3903520,4,B002C4JUQC,"This is a OLD movie about a man that is looking for something in his life. It is a good story but it is still an OLD ""B"" movie. Very good and easy to enjoy if you remember that it is before 1080p and all the new fancy picture stuff. just watch and enjoy life as we saw it in the 60s.",1453852800,,283,3.5806451612903225

3903523,1,B002C4JUQC,"Unable to stick it out to the end. Very poor audio. Very grainy. Plot, well typical cowboy plot with bad guys trying to take over the old homestead (marina).

Positive, it was ""free"" on Amazon Prime so I don't feel as if I had wasted my money.",1437436800,,243,4.170212765957447

3903525,1,B002C4JUQC,I have a pretty high tolerance for grade B movies but  the combination of bad sound & bad cinematography had me bailing on this after 10 minutes,1426291200,,144,4.333333333333333

8363081,4,B002C4JUQC,Heart warming fun. The fight has just begun.,1526515200,,44,4.625
8363082,3,B002C4JUQC,"I clicked on this by mistake & the quality of the movie -- bad lighting - bad sound - bad cinema photography - I almost stopped watching.
But I saw a shot when the boat was going out of polluted waterways & I stopped to see what other things might be in other shots.
Then they made a comment on pollution. I was shocked - a family flick mentioning pollution in the early 70's.
It is a very silly movie & age probably did a number on the film quality before it was saved.
I know I will probably never watch this again but I am glad I saw it once.",1505347200,,545,3.918918918918919
