8342125,5,B000NP3IBU,"Once upon a time I read a supposed true story about a guy who had a gun pulled on him while his wife was seated next to him.  In the story he used some of the 'advanced' gun disarmament techniques to take the gun away and 'never put his wife in danger'.  Looking into it more I started to realize the story was marketing hype.  More then likely it never happened and the techniques that were taught were worthless!

This story did have a effect on me, though.  I realized that even though I might now how to fight and protect myself I really wouldn't know how to handle a gun attack w/ my girlfriend or family member standing next to me.  Now I was on a quest.  Some where there had to be actual good idea to handle just such a situation.  And that's where these DVDs came in.  After years of looking these are w/out a doubt some of the best I've come across for those situations.  Gregg Wooldridge cover a lot of different subject and techniques.  All of them important to know.  I got more then I expect.  Gregg spent time cover the all important and hardly ever covered by others Pre-Emptive strikes.  This is where YOU take the fight to someone else.  There's also a selection on avoiding the takedown and getting back up quick if you get knocked down.  Gregg moves into real Bodyguard lessons as model joins him.  He demonstrates how to move a loved one around and shield them from danger.  Another great section has to do w/ improvised weapons like belts and pens.  Very interesting.

And now on to my favorite DVD.  The Gun Disarming.  Again w/out a doubt some of the best I've used or seen.  No lie.  The Techniques work and are very natural.  I've studied Krav Maga and done some of their gun disarming techniques -- but nothing as good as these.  In fact, I showed these moves to a fellow classmate there, who happens to be in the FBI, he loved the techniques, too.  Again I can't say enough about these DVDs.

Two thumbs up!",1231545600,2,1935,4.34453781512605
