8342515,5,B001TZQ4NM,"The drummers he inspired with his feet are too many to mention. In fact he is one of the few drummers who repeats his solo from this vid virtually note perfect every solo he does..... decades later! This is a must intro for anyone learning the business of double bass drum soloing and more. I first saw this on his ""Hot LIcks"" VHS in the 80's. So glad i could buy this DVD for me and my son who is learning to play.",1517961600,,415,4.0120481927710845

8342517,5,B001TZQ4NM,This dvd gives in detail what some drummers may overlook and remind you of what you may have thought is insignificant as a beginner or even an intermediate drummer.  I am sure you will be completely impressed with it.  Very useful information that can be applied to your practice and give a real perspective with what it takes and develop a self trained mind with very good explainations of what is happening on this dvd.  I strongly recommend this dvd for any drummer that feels subconsciousness and perfected reflex just happens with inspiration without countless hours and years of practice and cross examining yourself or even knowing how or what to look for or what you may be not thinking of as an experienced drummer.  You will get great tips and a professional experience and will want to use these techniques for yourself as I feel the same way for myself.,1494201600,,865,4.708609271523179

8342519,5,B001TZQ4NM,An all time favorite drummer of mine. Had this originally on VHS. Tommy delivers no nonsense double bass instruction.,1487203200,,117,5.2105263157894735
8342520,5,B001TZQ4NM,"I remember Tommy's first video on VHS. Then the second one. I am glad that Arlen Roth re-mastered both to DVD with some features. I remember Tommy back when I was very young as I got into my older Brother's record collection and discovered Black Oak Arkansas. Then I saw Tommy with Pat Travers and then later on with Randy Rhoads doing the Diary/ Blizzard tour right before Randy's death.
I also had a blast about 10 years ago at Tommy Aldridge's drum clinic. He was real down to earth and seemed very honest and answered anything. He would show you too any riff if you asked him regarding a song or a part within a song he would jump on it. He was a lot of fun! What can ya say.... This video is something to reach out to and attempt to strive towards.  I also take private lessons. The teacher has me working out of a few books. Two of those books are by Mr. Charles Dowd titled ""A funky Primer"" and ""a Funky Thesaurus"".  These books are amazing and after working on other concepts from different styles or trying to grasp that, then I come back to this here and focus on it and it has done wonders. Probably of all the drum videos I own from everyone like Lang, Danoti, Appice, Kollias , ...  This video right here still remains #1 in my book!",1439856000,,1246,4.226890756302521
8342521,5,B001TZQ4NM,"Awesome video
Tommy talks about not just double bass but also has sections on equipment choices...cymbals...seat positions  and even how to twirl sticks.
Tommy acknowledges that he is not the greatest drummer.....but he may be the most entertaining to watch and I would rather watch and hear him that someone who just plays.
Tommy is the greatest live hard rock metal drummer in my opinion.
I love Mr. Peart for his technique.
I love Tommy Lee for his attitude.
But Mr. Aldridge is the total package.
At 65 he is still on tour with Whitesnake in 2015.(im going to see him july 2015)
I also recommend the live whitesnake dvd his solo is as always incredible.
Tommy is what a rock and roll show is all about. Awesome sound and awesome theatrics.
If you ever dreamed of becoming a rock star drummer......you have your recipe book.
 Watch Listen Practice",1427587200,,850,4.697986577181208
8342522,5,B001TZQ4NM,"BRILLIANT!

Mix power, technique, creativity and an incredible showmanship and you've got Tommy!

This video will improve a lot your double bass ability. Tommy is a very skillful musician (and he's self-taught!!!).

When he talks even who's not a native english speaker can understand almost everything (i'm italian).

Plus : He's really intersting to watch!!.",1310428800,3,360,5.490909090909091
