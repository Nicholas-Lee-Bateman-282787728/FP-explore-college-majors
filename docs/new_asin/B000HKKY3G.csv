2638851,4,B000HKKY3G,A love story with Biblical history. Victor Mature is awesome in the movie. Good for teaching children about the Bible but adults will enjoy it also. I wish more movies were made like this today.,1227571200,,194,4.571428571428571
2638852,5,B000HKKY3G,"Really good.  The color was beautiful. I first saw this movie when I was about 10 yrs old in 1949, I enjoyed it now as much as I did then.",1220572800,,138,3.6
2638853,4,B000HKKY3G,"I enjoyed this film.  I won't say it's one of the 10 best ever made but the acting is quite good, and the storyline of course is well-known by most people.  Llamar looks terrific and Mature makes a great Samson.  It's definitely the best version of this tale on film, so if you're a fan of this story, or of Hedy Llamar, this is a good buy.",1215388800,,340,4.044776119402985
2638854,1,B000HKKY3G,"One big problem - it's an Asian import, and that means it has the poorest of video quality.  If you want to watch a good movie with absolutely awful video quality, then this is your choice.  What a shame.  Cecil must be spinning in his grave.",1204934400,7,242,4.217391304347826
2638855,4,B000HKKY3G,"DeMille was clever at combining sex with religion (see his 1927 ""King of Kings"" and the way he embellishes the story of Mary Magdalen). In this movie he combines gorgeous Hedy Lamarr with hunk Victor Mature -- two ingenious strokes of casting -- along with enough corn to feed everyone in Canaan. Too many Philistine officials have British accents and the entire cast looks overwhelmingly Western European. The costuming and military gear are a hodgepodge from various cultures, but seem to be generally accurate. That said, the scenes where Mature slaughters a slew of his enemies with a donkey's jawbone and then later brings down the Philistine temple, not to mention the sight of Hedy herself, are  themselves worth the price of admission. An earlier action scene in which Mature strangles a lion (""He's only a young lion"", Samson says dismissively in the script) just doesn't seem to pack the wallop it should, likely because in many of the quick cuts it's easy to tell that Mature had been replaced by a stunt man. One main selling point of many DeMille movies is spectacle; oddly, the only big spectacle is Samson's destruction of the temple, but it's still a mighty impressive piece of work given the technology of 1949 film making. The movie's plot line diverges wholesale from legend and Biblical scripture. In the movie Samson's bride dies by the spear, but official legend says she was burned -- probably a little too raw for 1949 crowds. In the movie Delilah does the haircutting, contrary to legend, and in the following scenes Mature's shortened hair is a bit too cleverly coiffed for having been cut with a hunting knife. Later, it looks more convincing. Many of the interior scenes look so stagey you have little difficulty guessing how many of the production crew were lurking in the wings and behind the walls. Aside from all this, the movie's major fault for me is that it's about half an hour too long. But for all the movie's flaws, the basic morality tale survives with all its ageless appeal. Mature's performance is unique, unlikely to be equalled by any possible remake. He's especially effective in the latter part of the film. Hedy's performance demonstrates that she had not only beauty but talent, especially in the later scenes. In fact, the film's romantic and psychological interest becomes much more involving after Samson's haircut. The scene in which Hedy first realizes the full effect of Samson's blindness is among her best work, and in many of her scenes that follow you'd almost think she was Garbo. From that point on, the movie and characters are raised almost to a 5-star level. S&D certainly has its moments: I saw its initial release at the age of five and for years recalled many scenes in detail. As for casting young Russ Tamblyn as Saul, well, it helps not to take this film too literally. Afterthought: one reviewer here was disappointed that the DVD isn't in wide-screen format. Sorry, youngster, but wide-screen movies didn't arrive until a few years later.",1201219200,4,3010,4.867446393762183
2638856,5,B000HKKY3G,"Fantastic! A great story with great attractive actors performing with great belivability!  This is one of the best biblical films out there, and a film guaranteed not to disappoint.

Enjoy!",1189036800,2,189,5.266666666666667
2638857,5,B000HKKY3G,"Hedy Lamarr took the title role of Delilah and made it her own... She was full and sparkling as the Philistine temptress, the central figure of Samson's last love story, dark and troubled when she took advantage of Samson's confidence to betray him to his enemies, repent and full of love when she sees him blinded and disgraced... Her name has since become synonymous with a voluptuous treacherous woman...

Victor Mature was a mighty, troubled Samson, beset by conflicting emotions, totally dominated by a pagan woman... He teases with her, perhaps showing some smarts here for a change... He falls victim to his enemies through the love of Delilah, a sophisticated beauty with innate elegance, who beguiles him into revealing the secret of his strength... His performance was always up to the standard of Lamarr... Together, they acted with wonderful passion and were as convincing dramatically as long-suffering Hebrews as they were Philistines drunk with victory...

George Sanders, whose dignified presence was a perfect match for the Saran of Gaza, admires Samson for his strength, and envies him for the love of his people... He persuades Delilah to find out what is the source of Samson's strength so they can destroy him...

""Samson and Delilah' is a film of emotion, of love, and action... It is at once a wonderful, and rich historical look at an ancient era, an excuse for beautiful and passionate music, and a thrilling climax hardly rivaled in its size and lavishness... The film is wonderful to look at, and the music is terrific...

Look for Russ Tamblyn playing the little shepherd Saul...",1168560000,22,1607,5.007490636704119
2638858,4,B000HKKY3G,"In searching for this movie I found there are two DVD products available along with a VHS version.  There were complaints about the video/audio quality on the other DVD and VHS versions, so I bought this one.  This DVD is also produced in China like the other version, but I have no complaints about the video or audio quality.  According to the box: ""For this new edition a 35mm interpositive was made from the original 3-strip Technicolor nitrate negative, and digitally transfered.  The soundtrack has been transfered from the 35mm optical positive protection master."".

My only complaint is that it is not in wide screen format.

Because it is a product of China the subtitles are in Chinese and it doesn't have the usual top menu system.  You pop the DVD in and the movie begins playing.  There are no special features except at the end of the movie you can watch the theatrical trailers for two other DeMille classics.

I won't waste time reviewing the plot or actor's performances - there are already some great reviews containing that information on the other versions available here, which I would only be duplicating.

I recommend you read the reviews of the other DVD  and VHS version, then play it safe and buy THIS one because of the poor quality reports on the others.",1161388800,57,1282,4.72972972972973
2638859,5,B000HKKY3G,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies, ever since I saw it at a theatre when I was about five years old (fifty years ago).  It was almost impossible to find a copy of it.  No one I checked with had it but you.  The dvd I got from you is in good shape.  The only drawback was that it has Korean subtitles, and the wording on the case is in Korean, too, which I do not read.  Otherwise, I am quite pleased to have finally added this movie to my collection of Biblical classics.",1264982400,,480,3.9583333333333335

The movie shows the complexity of mixing love, culture, and destiny. Much to Delilah's credit, she did subtly admit her reason for wanting to know Samson's secret to his strength. Much to my dismay, however, Samson denounced his vows as a Nazarene and broke his promise to himself and was captured and put in chains. The good news is this.

8140241,5,B000HKKY3G,"I'll not run through the entire film, but rather point out the scene that had an
ever lasting effect all my life. This would be towards the end of the film. The now
blind Samson stands between the two huge pillars which the towering philistine god -
dagon - rests upon. As the crowd of 3 thousand mock and laugh at the seemingly helpless
strongman, Samson pushes mightily upon the stone pillars whith strength given back to him
by a forgiving God.
As the cheering of the people
intensifies, the camera slowly closes in to a bottom area of one of the pillars. Suddenly,
ever so slightly, the pillar actually gives way. With that,silence imediatly sweeps across the 3 thousand
philistines as one of the women in the crowd utters, ""It moved.""",1321056000,,739,4.606060606060606
8140242,2,B000HKKY3G,"One of my favorite movies finally came to DVD only to be shown in washedout color. The radiant technicolor of the original has been compromised, especially with regard to the reds (which look more brownish at times) and the golds (which have lost their sheen). I have a far better VHS recording made directly from a TCM broadcast. The story is well known and need not be repeated here. Unfortunately, DeMille's first choice (a youthful Steve Reeves)to play Samson was rejected by the studio (Paramount) which wanted a bigger ""name"" and was replaced by the always smug looking Victor Mature.  A 29? year old Reeves later appeared in the first of the many Italian ""sword and sandal"" movies of the 50s and 60s as Hercules. Imagine what he might have brought to S&D. Ironically, one of the last scenes of HERCULES showed Reeves pulling down some columns on a bunch of Greek warriors which may have been a deliberate echo of what Samson did at the end of S&D. Lamarr was exquisite in every way and was a most credible Delilah. George Sanders as the Saran deliciously chewed up the scenery and stole a number of scenes; and Henry Wilcoxon as his hapless general (a regular in DeMille movies)gave his usual solid performance. Look for a very young Angela Lansbury as Delilah's doomed ""older"" sister and George Reeves (who later played Superman) as a surviving soldier whose compatriots were all done in by Samson wielding the jawbone of an ass. But also look for a better DVD copy and forget this Chinese ripoff!",1310688000,,1505,4.722433460076045
8140243,5,B000HKKY3G,"Maybe my favorite ""Biblical"" movie...although ""Ben Hur"" is right at the top too.

Fantastic story, great acting and of course, ""Hedy Lamar""  Grrr...talk about eye candy!!!  Stunning beauty and sexuality.

Highly recommend.",1277078400,,222,5.84375
