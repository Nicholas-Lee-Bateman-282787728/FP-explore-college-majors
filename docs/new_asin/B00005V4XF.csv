1672187,5,B00005V4XF,Always loved William Castle movies.  Watch this one some time late and night and in the right mood and you will thoroughly enjoy it.  Probably more as a comedy now than a scary movie - but you will enjoy it nonetheless!,1021420800,3,219,4.317073170731708
1672188,5,B00005V4XF,"WHEN I FIRST SAY MR. SARDONICUS WHEN IT WAS RELEASED IN THEATERS, I WAS AMAZED AT THE MAKE-UP EFFECTS USED TO CREATE MR. SARDONICUS.  AFTER MANY YEARS OF WATCHING HORROR AND SCI-FI, I STILL FEEL THAT MR. SARDONICUS RATES AS ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIMES.  FOR A MOVIE MADE AT THAT TIME, THE ACTING AND STORY LINE WAS UNIQUE AND AS ALWAYS A WILLIAM CASTLE PRODUCTION OF QUALITY.  AS ONE WHO HAS BOUGHT OVER 200 DVD's FROM AMAZON.COM, I AM ALLOWED TO RELIVE THE 50's, 60'S, AND 70'S OF HORROR THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE SO AVAILABLE.  THANKS!!!",1017360000,3,542,4.39
1672189,5,B00005V4XF,"The masked Baron Sardonicus has quite a few skeletons in his closet, and one in particular he keeps in a room in his isolated, gloomy Slavic castle. And that's only part of it. Mr. S's face is frozen into a hideous grin, so socializing is, well, kind of awkward, and his table manners are appalling, making it necessary to take his meals in his room. Sardonicus is also a very cruel man, feared and hated by all, including his lovely English wife, Maude.  His affliction is due to a very traumatic experience some years before, and now he seeks a cure.  A renowned English physician is called for, and by coincidence, was a former flame of Maude's. Ah, the wheels of melodrama start a-turnin'!
""Mr. Sardonicus"" was penned by Ray Russell, who adapted his novella for the screen.  The film was directed by gimmickmeister William Castle, who came up with the ""Punishment Poll"". The ""Punishment Poll"" was an audience participation shtick in which viewers could decide whether it would be ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" for the wicked Mr. Sardonicus. Of course, no one but the extremely fickle would vote ""thumbs up"", so the ""happy"" ending (did it ever really exist?) was never seen. The film is a lot of fun (hey, it's William Castle), and the performances are first-rate. Guy Rolfe is actually quite charming as the wretched Sardonicus, and handsome Ronald Lewis and lovely Joan Bennett lookalike Audrey Dalton are stoically appealing as Sir Robert and Maude. Erika Peters is a hoot as Sardonicus' late, money-hungry first wife (before he hit the jackpot-with-a-price), and, of course, the great Oscar Homolka as ""Krull"".  Krull is Sardonicus' sinister and loyal handyman.  Krull says, ""When the master says 'Krull, do the thing, I do the thing'!""  He puts leeches on a servant girl's face, tortures peasant girls from the neighboring village, and has even lost an eye, the result of one of Sardonicus' rages.  And he takes it all in stride-up to a point.  Mr. Homolka is a joy to watch, a gruff rascal, and steals the show, like a deposed Leonid Brezhnev. The really don't make character actors like this anymore!
""Mr. Sardonicus"" is a cozy, old-fashioned costume melodrama, an homage to the horror films of the '30s and '40s, and is, to put it simply, a lot of fun!  The fog-shrouded sets, the unspecified Middle European setting, the gloomy castle, the horrible and tragic title character, all the classic elements are there.  It also, for some strange reason, makes me hungry for stuffed cabbage, goulash, noodles, and a nice bottle of Bull's Blood (no, it's not really blood-it's a delicious Hungarian red wine) Oh, the power of cinema!
The picture and sound quality on the DVD are very good.  I do wish that the making-of feaurette, ""Taking the Punishment Poll"", was longer and more informative. It runs a mere 7 minutes, as opposed to the remarkable ""Battle-Axe"" featurette on the ""Strait-Jacket"" DVD, another Castle campfest starring Joan ""Mommie"" Crawford. Well, you axed for it!",1016582400,5,2983,4.887128712871287
1672190,5,B00005V4XF,"This is a great, fun movie from the William Castle oeuvre, with the gimmick this time being a punishment poll where moviegoers were (supposedly) allowed to choose whether to really let that evil ole' Sardonicus have it or not. The version I saw he (not surprisingly) gets the extra punishment, as I'm sure has always been the case.
Overall, this movie is very camp, with an outrageously improbable story that works all the same. Also the homoerotic over- and undertones don't hurt. And one last thing: Sir Robert rules!",1013990400,,519,4.842696629213483
1672191,4,B00005V4XF,"I organized a screening of this film for a college audience several years ago... everyone left with permanent smiles on their faces, due to the hilarious melodrama and sadistic nature of this early '60s chestnut.
Mr. Sardonicus is filthy rich, but has paid a price for his wealth with a mysterious facial disfigurement. He resorts to obscuring his (presumably) hideous, ugly mug behind a creepy mask, and residing in a lofty castle in the middle of nowhere. Believing his disfigurement is somehow reversible, he tests the limits of human endurance by torturing everyone in his immediate vicinity in order to contrive a remedy for his tragic condition. His wife, who remains in the loveless marriage out of fear of her crazed husband, enlists the assistance of an old friend: a physician who has made some remarkable breakthroughs with patients suffering from paralysis. One comes to discover, over the course of a new battery of treatments, how Sardonicus acquired his horrible disfigurement - and why exactly he's become such a flamboyant misanthrope.
This film was another staging opportunity for director William Castle's penchant for gimmickry... this time around, Castle concocted THE PUNISHMENT POLL. Moviegoers were issued small glow-in-the-dark cards, featuring a fist with thumb outstretched. In the tradition of the Roman arenas, where the audience decided whether a vanquished gladiator should live or die, Castle supposedly let the attendees of the film decide the fate of Mr. Sardoncius. Should one pick MERCY (thumb up) or NO MERCY (thumb down) after witnessing the trials of this ruthless rogue? Allegedly, the movie theater manager would tabulate the votes (in the dark, no less - hence, the G-I-T-D cards) and screen the ending of the film the majority of the audience voted for. Castle maintained that it was almost always the ending where Sardonicus received NO MERCY, and thus this was the conclusion that most people have seen.
Castle claimed in his autobiography that they did, in fact, film the alternate ending where Sardonicus received MERCY, so that movie theaters could have it on hand in the unlikely event that the audience was in a forgiving mood. Other sources claim this is clearly not true, and that Castle only stated this alternate ending existed so as to give his gimmick the appearance of being authentically credible. Among many points of the latter argument: Castle's appearance towards the conclusion of the film resoundingly encourages the audience to vote for NO MERCY (paraphrasing: 'Did you see the horrible things he did to that girl?', etc.). I'm hoping this DVD release will the record straight, once and for all. Who knows - maybe this alternate ending really has been sitting in a film vault for forty years, after previously being 'rarely screened' ...?
I am also curious to see if Columbia / Tri-Star will be including a reproduction copy of an original PUNISHMENT POLL card, ala the reproduction of the Ghost Viewer that was included in the DVD release of 13 GHOSTS. If so, this would be the icing on the cake of an undoubtedly great release - which, incidentally, has never been commercially available in the United States in any format until now.
If you like this Castle film, check out: HOMICIDAL, STRAIT-JACKET, and the original 13 GHOSTS... all newly released on DVD.",1011139200,6,3324,5.078610603290676

It wasn't gory as today's movies, but it did hold your interest and a unique ending. You ( the audience ) was to take part in it in your own home. It was very interesting how they made it and why this could stick in your mind as something you may want for your collection. I would say don't pass it up and it's more affective in black and white.

Well, I'm 50 now, and thought I should check this one out, seeing as I have all of Mr. Castle's other films.  I was really pleasantly surprised---it's somewhat of a period piece, taking place in London in the 1880's, and the look of the film is very atmospheric.  I don't think today's kids would be scared of it at all, nor do I think they'd actually stick with it and watch it all the way through------it's quite talky compared to the other Castle films, but I actually enjoyed that about this film---great character development, fantastic story---this is one of those movies to watch on a rainy day, all hunkered up on the couch.

I love his outfits ( Talk about Swagger )and his towering presence commands you to watch him!( did I mention he's wearing a creepy mask) As far as the Horror aspect, it won't make your skin crawl but it's still a fun film.

While it's not as over-the-top as Castle's other works, such as The Tingler or House on Haunted Hill, Mr. Sardonicus does possess a charm that only William Castle can bring to these glorious black and white treasures.

Guy Rolfe is memorable as the title character, and his supporting cast members are equally fine throughout.

The dvd quality is to be expected for a film of this vintage, and my copy was fine; clear and crisp - it almost looks like it could have been a film made in the 80's.",1313020800,,599,4.330357142857143
1672223,4,B00005V4XF,"By always missing his intended mark as a master of the Gore And Scream Screen William Castle always managed to create amazingly effective low-budget psychological horror films, some of which are real classics like THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, THE TINGLER, and MR. SARDONICUS (often referred to as ""Dr. Sardonicus,"" a much more alliterative title). Castle also enjoyed throwing audience participation novelties into his films. In MR. SARDONICUS, the audience gets to vote on the ending (even though the results of the vote are a foregone conclusion). If Castle's films have a weakness, it's that his filmmaking economics don't allow for a deeper look inside the characters' motivations. Ten more minutes here and there could have ensured smoothly flowing, slowly building, truly disturbing storylines. MR. SARDONICUS cries out for those few extra minutes.

But what MR. SARDONICUS really is crying out for is a modern remake. A gothic tale that samples DRACULA, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, SHERLOCK HOLMES and the Jack The Ripper case, among other sources, MR. SARDONICUS takes place circa 1880 in a small village in the Carpathian Mountains whence a distinguished British doctor is summoned to help the horribly disfigured mask-wearing Sardonicus to recovery. When the Doctor arrives at the Sardonicus Estates, he discovers that frightening experiments are being carried out on local villagers, the household staff are hideously tortured for minor infractions of Sardonicus' many rules, and that Sardonicus enjoys terrorizing young beauties by removing his mask---we think.

The truth of Sardonicus' condition is slowly discovered and a cure of a sort is effected. One might say, ""The Moral of the Story is . . . "" but that would be giving it away.",1305504000,,1740,5.255395683453237
1672224,5,B00005V4XF,"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid although probably not the best idea. It really frightened me. However as an adult I remembered only parts of the movie and wanted to see if it was still as scary. Although it frightened me as a child, I liked it. Today I have viewed the movie in it's entirety and found it to be a very good movie, not at all as scary as I remembered it as a child, but more age appropriate (realizing real and unreal). I really like old movies, how they were made in this particular era. Although I really like this movie, I did not neccessarily like the ending, tragic and no mercy.

One of William Castle's greatest films.",1293840000,,656,4.248
1672225,4,B00005V4XF,"Schlockmeister William Castle (1914-1977) has been gone for over a generation now and his name is not well known to many younger horror fans although they are familiar with the recent remakes of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and 13 GHOSTS which are modern day gorefests that totally miss the spirit of the originals. Often described as ""the poor man's Hitchcock"" (a title he relished), Castle made low budget films of the suspense and horror variety with the occasional comedy thrown in. Most of his movies were marketed with gimmicks like fright insurance for MACABRE, electrified theater seats for THE TINGLER, and special ghost glasses for 13 GHOSTS. But underneath the gimmicks there was solid if unspectacular direction, some startling imagery, and an element of cheerful sadism that left an impression long after you had left the theater. Looked at today, most of his films remain fun to watch and still have a certain edge. Several have just been released by Sony Pictures as double features on DVD.

1961's MR SARDONICUS is my favorite of Castle's movies for a number of reasons. First and foremost is the film's black and white Gothic setting which recalls the Universal films of the 1930s and the aforementioned sadistic elements that recall the Hammer films of the same time period (Guy Rolfe, who plays the title character, was in THE STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY the year before). Then there are the various film references from Paul Leni's THE MAN WHO LAUGHS (1928) to Georges Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE (1959) and Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY (1960). This film in turn heavily influenced Vincent Price's character in THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES (1971). Finally there is the appearance of William Castle himself to conduct the ""Punishment Poll"" as to the fate of the central character. Priceless. Is it a great movie? No, but this story of a hideously disfigured man and the attempts to correct that disfigurement does entertain and it still delivers the goods. Disposable entertainment that turns out not to be so disposable after all.",1280448000,,2031,4.991150442477876

1672228,4,B00005V4XF,"Mr. Sardonicus (William Castle, 1961)

When you sit down to watch a William Castle flick, you should already be aware that you're not in for deathless cinema; these are movies that exist just to give you a good time. Not all of his films achieve this, but Mr. Sardonicus is just the thing for a dreary night when you're looking for a cheese-fest that, despite its silliness, still manages a few chills.

The title character (Guy Rolfe, an upscale actor early in his career who ended up in the Puppet Master films) is one of those guys your mother warned you about: he made a face, and it froze that way. This had something to do with looking through his dead and buried father's coat for a lottery ticket, but the reason it happened isn't all that important; it's the effect that counts. His wife, Maude (Kitten with a Whip's Audrey Dalton), looks up an old flame who's become a doctor to see if he can cure her husband. The doctor, Sir Robert Cargrave (Nurse on Wheels' Robert Lewis), heads down to Sardonicus' estate, and quickly determines that the problem is actually psychosomatic; the question is, how to convince Sardonicus that he's got a cure, when the cure must come from inside Sardonicus itself? To complicate matters, Maude and Robert's old relationship rears its ugly head, and Sardonicus becomes convinced the two of them are having an affair.

While the script (from Ray Russell, who would soon go on to fame and fortune with the cult sci-fi classic X: The Man with X-Ray Eyes) is solid, what's really surprising here is the talent among what is essentially a cast of minor-at-best actors. You get the feeling that every one of the principals here, most of whom were TV character actors, should have been far better known than they ever got. The acting here is really top-notch for a William Castle joint, and it seems to have inspired him to new heights of directorial prowess; great pacing, great atmosphere, and a pretty fun gimmick (though you'll have to read about it online, unless you have a really well-stocked film nostalgia store nearby). This is good old-fashioned Castle fun at its finest. *** ",1248739200,,2122,4.711590296495957

You might remember the main character, Baron Sardonicus (Guy Rolfe) if you've seen the movie Dolls. He played the man who created the Dolls with his wife.

The first time I saw it, I was mesmerized and of course couldn't wait to see what he looked like under his mask. Let me tell you I actually clapped a hand over my mouth when I saw him.

These old horror flicks are so great--we we're very fortunate as kids to have these to watch every week--FOR FREE!! I'm not that old- when I was watching these, they had already been around for 10 or 12 years.

Upon arrival Sir Robert finds the town lives in fear of Mr. Sardonicus, the very man Sir Robert is there to see.  Seems Sir Robert's old flame, Maude, ended up marrying Sardonicus and now lives with him in his castle along with Sardonicus' evil disfigured(is there any other kind?) henchman, Krull.  At the castle, Sir Robert witnesses some odd goings on including the maid tortured with leeches and sexy gals showing up and disappearing.  Sardonicus roams around in a mask, but eventually lets Sir Robert in on the reason for his summons.  Through a desperate yet sacreligious act, he's now cursed with a permanent grin that brings back haunting memories of Jani Lane in the Cherry Pie video.  Sardonicus uses Maude as a bargaining chip to get Sir Robert to work his medical magic and cure him.  This all leads to the famous ""Punishment Poll"" that Castle whipped up for the film.  It's fun, kooky, silly, and a reminder of just how cool the guy was, and how cool the movie going experience could be back in the day.

As with his earlier HOMICIDAL, Castle kept the obvious cheeeze to a minimum, offering instead a dark, gothically tinged tale of greed, sadism, and insanity. Guy Rolfe embodies Sardonicus, making his malevolence come alive. We get the definite impression right away, that there's more behind the mask than a mere physical problem. This guy is a truly loathesome individual! The more he talks, the blacker his soul appears. Still, there is a tragic history to this man, a past event so horrible, that all goodness has drained away from him. Sardonicus is a wretched b@$t@rd made that way through his own folly. He's paid quite a high price for his mistakes. I can't say I wouldn't wind up the same way! Although I hope not! MR. SARDONICUS has a nice bleak atmosphere, and presents some rather unsettling images for a 1961 US film. These include -a maid hanging by her thumbs while being threatened with leeches. -a disfigured Sardonicus feasting face-down in / on a bowl of slime. Also, those poor village gals who were rounded up and brought to Mr. S by his henchman, Krull. What was that all about?

1672247,3,B00005V4XF,"I watched ""Mr Sardonicus"" shortly after ""I Saw What You Did"", and I was relieved to see that William Castle hadn't sunk into comedy territory for this one. It's actually made earlier, around the same time as Castle's other most successful outings, although, this is one of his lesser known movies. ""Sardonicus"" is a period piece beginning with a successful young doctor, who recieves a cryptic letter from his former fiancee urging him to visit her and her mysterious husband Baron Sardonicus at their remote mansion somewhere in the middle of Europe. She hints that she is in some danger, and as she is the only woman he has ever loved, he drops everything and sets off immediately. When he arrives he finds that Sadronicus is more than just a little strange, in fact he rules over the household like a tyrant, and never appears in public without wearing a strange face mask...

Much of the film is very reminiscent of Roger Corman's ""Fall of the House of Usher"", although without the fabulous colour photography and on a much lower budget. Although Guy Rolfe (who plays Sardonicus) is no Vincent Price, he does a very good job of selling the character as thoroughly unwholesome and with a very cruel streak. What impressed me about the film is that it is surprisingly harsh in it's depiction of Sardonicus' sadistic past-times. He keeps a disfigured manservant as his most loyal servant, and together they devise cruel tortures which are carried out on the only other member of the household staff, a terrified maid. As well as this, Sardonicus lures girls from a nearby village to his mansion for some kind of peverted sexual desires which are never explained or depicted on the screen. It's all very lurid and Sardonicus makes for a great villain with his immobile face mask and haughty clipped manner of speech.

Sadly what lets the film down is it's patently phony production values. The gloomy scenery (shown at length, unfortunately) from a carriage window as the young doctor travels to the Sardonicus dwelling is a very shabby studio miniature, and all the ""external"" scenes have a painted backdrop of sky that the actors seem about to hit their heads on at any minute. The interiors of the mansion also look very studio built, with very meagre trappings of supposed wealth that just seem to be whatever the set designers could find in the nearest props cupboard. The other big drawback is that Sardonicus exudes an air of power over his household, but there is no real evidence to support it, in fact the young doctor could easily disable, overpower or even kill his tormentor and flee the mansion if he chose to, but he never does. Of course, it would spoil the plot if any of the household showed any resistance to Sardonicus, so we just have to believe that he is somehow all powerful.

William Castle is again on hand as a show man, and this time he halts the proceedings in the last few minutes for the famous ""Punishment Poll"", where audiences are asked to vote for whether Sardonicus should be made to pay for his evil deeds, or be let off. Naturally, the ""no mercy"" option is deemed to have got the most votes, and the film ends with a mean kick in the teeth for our villain.

All in all, it's good fun, although the lack of budget really makes a difference. Usually Castle hides this pretty well, so it must be the period setting that makes the corner-cutting more apparent than it normally is. I can't help thinking of it as ""Fall of the House of Usher""'s poor cousin, but it lacks the overblown hysteria and grand scale of that mini-epic. If Castle knew more about creating or sustaining a gothic mood, ""Mr Sardonicus"" could have been a significant work of horror cinema, as the events that take place in it could pack quite a punch if presented the right way...but Castle is having his usual fun with the material, and something that could have been sinister and quite unpleasant (the torture of the maid hints at a very dark mind at work) becomes nothing more than just mildly thrilling.

But William Castle is more about fun than terror, and we should appreciate his unique talents. If you look carefully at the one, fleeting exterior shot of Sardonicus mansion, you'll see that the layout of windows is designed to make it appear like a big grinning face, which I thought was a great touch. The acting is alll pretty good, with particular mention going to Oscar Homolka as the crazed manservant. That and the outlandish true face of Sardonicus that lies behind the mask give enough good reasons for the film to be worth watching.",1151020800,6,4555,4.6745635910224435

""Desparate to retrieve a winning lottery ticket, a greedy baron unearths his father's corpse. An enormous jackpot is his reward, but not without a price: his face is frozen permanently into a hideous grin. He enlists his fiendish one-eyed servant to help him lift this horrible curse, but their schemes fail. Finally, he turns to a noted neurosurgen -- and his wife's former lover -- to cure him.
This creepy horror classic is based on a novella by screenwriter Ray Russel, and is brought to life by William Castle, master of terror!""

I had been curious about this film for quite some time, and once I saw it at a reasonable price I knew I had to get it. And I'm sure glad I did -- it was even better than I'd expected! This 1961 black and white Castle film could easily be mistaken for just another drive-in camp-fest. Not so! While the overall mood was more fun than frightening (though back then I'm sure it was a creepy shocker), it still maintained a sort of gothic feel with its old-fashioned horror. The story is captivating, the acting is above average, and the facial effects for the villain -- though by today's standards a bit weak -- are still impressive. Scene after scene, you're drawn into a kind of horror-drama that's cringe-worthy in some parts, thought-provoking in others, and except for a few slightly boring time-fillers has you on the edge of your seat. The charatcers are easy to gain sympathy for -- or in the case of the more sinister ones, ridicule -- and carry the script well. Guy Rolfe, of course, steals the show as the calm, cool, collective, and crazily cruel baron who is inflicted with the frozen smile. His name is even taken from the term ""risus sardonicus"" -- a condition (most commonly caused by tetanus) that can make it look like the sufferer has an unflinching grimace on their face. He wears a mask to conceal his gruesome secret, but ultimately wants something better -- a true fix. To get this fix, he goes to depraved lengths, until finally the doctor finds a way that might restore a more normal appearance -- but we end up discovering there's a tragic catch to this cure. Because of his miserable life, I actually felt sorry for the poor fellow, but hey, I wasn't the one getting leaches hooked onto me, my eye gouged out, or my own mug threatened with an identical smirk to his!

As for the DVD, while it's nothing grand, there are a few special features: theatrical trailers (13 Ghosts, Strait Jacket, and Mr. Sardonicus) as well as an all-new making-of featurette (which lasts only 7 minutes long). Still, with digitally remastered audio and video, it's a pretty good package. Definitely a must-own for fans of 60's horror and interesting, original concepts. Don't miss this one!",1149033600,3,2780,4.636916835699797
1672249,4,B00005V4XF,"William Castle...producer, writer, director, and sometimes actor, but first and foremost a showman.  All right...the man was a hack (in the kindest possible sense), pure and simple, often regarded as a Hitchcock imitator (he even adopted a number of Hitchcockian mannerisms like appearing briefly in his own movies, etc.), and his films maybe have not been of the highest caliber, but he knew how to draw in and entertain audiences by use of sometimes very clever gimmicks, at least in terms of his horror films of the 50s and 60s, and made going to the movies an interactive event, rather than a passive activity, ensuring those who came got their money's worth.  While Mr. Sardonicus (1961) isn't my favorite Castle film (I've always been partial to House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler), it's still a lot of fun, especially if you're a fan of schlocky, sleaze-tinged, lurid spectacles like I am...written by Ray Russell (The Premature Burial, X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes) and produced and directed by William Castle (House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler, 13 Ghosts), the film stars Guy Rolfe, whom I last saw in Ivanhoe (1952) as the evil Prince John, Audrey Dalton (The Monster That Challenged the World, Kitten with a Whip), Ronald Lewis (Taste of Fear), and Austrian born actor Oskar Homolka, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role in the film I Remember Mama (1948)...you've come a long way since then, Babaloo...

The story begins in London, the year being 1880...Castle comes on the screen for a brief intro, which leads into our tale proper in that we meet Sir Robert Cargrave (Lewis), a young, prominent English physician who's done quite well for himself.  After receiving a urgent letter from his ex-love (And then there's) Maude (who'd gone off and unwillingly married another), played by Dalton, Robert hops a boat to the continent, and makes his way to a central European country named Gorslava, which, I think is near Freedonia, but I can't be sure...anyway, turns out the man Maude married, a nasty fellow named Baron Sardonicus (Rolfe), has a bit of a problem with his mug, one caused by an unpleasant past experience gone into in great detail by use of a lengthy flashback of ghoulish proportions involving a lottery ticket, a dead body, and a money grubbing spouse, which I won't go into, but suffice to say the good Baron now sports a giant, permanent, toothy grin which he hides by wearing a mask. He's exhausted nearly all means of treatment, and his last hope lies in Sir Robert, whom he makes an offer the English gentleman can't refuse.  Sir Robert agrees and the local canine population dwindles dramatically as he researches the possibility of using a poisonous tropical plant to treat the disfigured Baron.  Will the cure work?  Or will Sir Robert find himself and Maude at the very un-tender mercies of the Baron's sadistically cruel, one-eyed manservant Krull (Homolka)?  Don't fret my frightful fiends, as all will be revealed...even that dark, disgusting secret the Baron keeps locked away in the upstairs room...

In terms of gimmickry, Mr. Sardonicus doesn't rate as high as some of Castle's other films (for The Tingler, vibrating devices would be affixed to the bottom of a few of the theater seats and activated during certain thrilling sequences), as it involved patrons being given cards with a glow in the dark hand printed on them.  Near the end of the film, Castle would appear onscreen and request the audience to participate in a `punishment poll', in that if they thought the main character deserved leniency, they would hold the card with the thumb point up, but if they thought the character deserved more punishment, they would hold the card with the thumb pointed down.  Castle would then make a production about counting the ballots, and however the audience voted would dictate how the rest of the film would play out (reminiscent of a thumbs up/thumbs down verdict used within the Roman Coliseum), indicating there were two possible endings...which there wasn't (apparently there was a separate version shown to drive in audiences, where Castle would ask patrons to flash their headlights rather than use the card, but it ended the same way).  Castle knew his audience, and knew they would always opt for `more punishment', but I can't help but wonder how many viewers bought into the illusion, thinking they were actually influencing the direction of the story (to this day rumors persist there's an alternate ending, but there isn't).  As far as the story goes, I didn't think it was particularly scary, but, as others have stated, it does emote a feel of those wonderful horror films produced by Universal in the 30s and 40s.  There is a slightly inexpensive (i.e. cheap) sense to the production, but Castle made the most of what he had, and a little imagination goes a long way, aided by spooky, gothic settings thick with atmosphere (leeches, torture chambers, bloodcurdling screams, etc.), surprisingly rich in detail, all tied together with a suitably creepy musical score.  The actors do well (Ms Dalton's character seemed a bit drab), most notably Rolfe in his role as the lead character.  His makeup looks a little hokem compared to today's standards, but I'm sure it was pretty effective some 40 years ago.  As nasty a character as he was, there was still underlying sense of pathos that stemmed from the portrayal of his character during the flashback, prior to the disfiguring incident, but, had I been in the audience, by the end of the film, I would have voted thumbs down, along with most everyone else (thousands of years of civilization still have yet to extinguish humanities animalistic desires).  Also, Homolka did very well in his over the top performance of the brutish, obedient, scarred lackey (he lost an eye to the Baron for a past indiscretion) Krull, gleefully applying leeches to the house servants, perhaps in an effort to develop his own cure for his cruel and demanding master.  Overall this is a macabre little tale, worth checking out if only to see the work of a Castle, a penultimate showman the likes of we'll never see again.

The widescreen (1.85:1) print on this DVD looks very sharp and clean, and the audio comes through loud and clear.  As far as special features, there's a relatively new featurette titled `Taking the Punishment Poll' (7:36) and a trailer for this film, along with some of Castle's other films available on DVD including 13 Ghosts (1960) and Straight-Jacket (1964).  The one thing that would have put this release over the top would have been the inclusion of a reproduction of the `thumbs up/thumbs down' ballot, but oh well...missed opportunities...

1672251,4,B00005V4XF,"With a film from producer-director William Castle the question is never what is the plot of the film but rather what gimmick has the master of horror schlock come up with this time around. For his 1961 release ""Mr. Sardonicus"" the gimmick was the ""Punishment Poll,"" which supposedly gave the audience the choice of how the film should end. Of course this is not going to be as much fun as the tingling seat, special viewing glasses for ghost-vision, or even the insurance policy to cover you in the event the film scared you to death, but you have to admit that even with DVDs there are limits to what can be done. The irony is that with the DVD format you really could choose between alternative endings-if only Castle had filmed one in the first place.

 Sir Robert Cargrave (Ronald Lewis) is a noted neurosurgeon who is summoned from England by her former lover Maude (Audrey Dalton) to a castle in Gorslava where she lives with her husband Baron Sardonicus (Guy Rolfe). The baron always wears a mask when he comes out of his room and eventually he tells Sir Robert the story of a lottery ticket and a ghoulish visit to a graveyard at midnight. Sardonicus wants Sir Robert to use his skills to cure his affliction, even if it means using new and untested methods to gain success, so that Maude, who was married off by her father to the baron, might finally love her husband. When Sir Robert balks at the idea, Sardonicus reveals an alternative plan for making the baroness more sympathetic to his condition.

 ""Mr. Sardonicus"" has every single one of the traditional elements of a gothic horror story. Our hero, a man of science, travels to a remote location in eastern Europe, where he meets the terrified local townsfolk, before heading on to an ancient castle on a hill surrounded by mist, where he is met by the deformed assistant to the mysterious baron, whose beautiful wife is held hostage to her husband's dangerous whims. But the film creates a nice gothic atmosphere (until the end) and the production values do not cheapen the experience but compare quite favorably to the Universal monster movies of the 40s and 50s. Cargrave is a bland hero and the effectiveness of the film rests on the character of the baron, who cuts a compelling figure as he speaks from behind his mask. More than anyone else, it is Rolfe who prevents the films from descending to the level of camp, although Oscar Homolka as the baron's disfigured but loyal servant Krull, turns in a solid performance along those same lines as well.

 Rather surprisingly, not only the story of how Sardonicus came to be this way but our look at the man behind the mask comes rather early in the film, at which point this horror film starts to turn into a medical problem-solving effort. Then we get to Castle's gimmick and the whole thing collapses. The ""Punishment Poll"" consisted of getting a rather large card when you entered the theater that could be raised to signify ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" when Castle appeared on the screen to conduct the poll. Supposedly the majority vote would apply, but Castle knew full well what his blood thirsty audience would want to see at the end of the film, so an alternative ending was never even filmed. Besides, Castle made it clear what sort of person would wimp out and give mercy to the title character. The only problem is that the little boy in the back row could have come up with a more painful punishment for Sardonicus than this rather low-keyed ending. Equally important, Castle's jovial appearance completely derails the film's momentum and dispels the gothic atmosphere.

 ""Mr. Sardonicus"" is an interesting little footnote to the history of horror films and if you have never seen a William Castle film then sooner or later you should check one of them out. There is a short documentary on this DVD about ""Taking the Punishment Poll"" that provides some insights into the film and the cast from film historians (the key one being that Castle's films are more about fun than fright). ""Mr. Sardonicus"" is one of several William Castle productions that Columbia is putting out on DVD, including ""Homicidal,"" ""13 Ghosts,"" and ""Strait-Jacket,"" a couple of which have trailers on this DVD.",1090713600,7,4215,4.717391304347826

In 1880, a famous London doctor is called to a creepy castle on an urgent mission.  Sir Robert the doctor receives a letter from his former lover, now married to Count Sardonicus.  She instructs the doctor to hurry; something terrible is about to happen.
Sir Robert arrives to find a strange castle occupied by a one-eyed servant named Krull, Sir Robert's beautiful former lover, and of course Count Sardonicus, whom we see introduced wearing a mask.  Hmmmmmm.  A creepy castle, a locked door, screams from remote parts of the castle, an eccentric Count in a mask...What OTHER cliches do we need?
Sure, the cliches are abundant and the sets are nothing to impress your friends with, but the acting is generally good.  The story is not believable, but we pretty much know that going in.  We don't expect much, but when we get to one of the film's several creepy moments, we feel as if we've gotten our money's worth.  Plus the patented William Castle Gimmick is firmly in place: The Punishment Poll, in which audience members decide whether the villain receives mercy or more punishment.  (Of course Castle only shot ONE ending.  In the DVD extras we learn how ridiculous it would have been to shoot two endings, poll the audience, then send a message up to the projectionist's booth to tell him which reel to show for the ending.  But it's still fun!)
'Mr. Sardonicus' is not a great horror film, but it doesn't really set out to be one.  But it is a fun, campy, competent entry in the early 60's horror genre.  I'll take it any day over 'Scream 5' or 'I Could Care Less What You Did Last Summer.'

Sardonicus's father had purchased a lottery ticket, and after his death, the family discovered it was the winning ticket, which had been buried along with the father...despite being poor, they would not even consider going into the grave and despoiling it to get the ticket, but Sardonicus had less qualms about this and went to the grave in the ""dead of night"" (what else?)and dug up the grave and opened the casket and found the ticket. The sight of his father's corpse so traumatized him, his own face became set in a rictus, and thus began the Sardonicus we meet at his castle, obtained, as was his entire fortune, by the monetary fulcrum provided by the lottery ticket.

1672258,4,B00005V4XF,"William Castle usually marketed his movies with gimmicks, and for MR. SARDONICUS the gimmick was ""the punishment poll.""  When the film played in theatrical release, audience members were issued a voting card, and near the movie's conclusion Castle himself appeared on the screen and asked the audience to vote: show the card thumbs up to show mercy, thumbs down for none.  Now, in theory, there were two different endings, and the ending shown depended on the audience vote--but no one ever saw the ""show mercy"" ending and it seems unlikely that it ever existed at all.  And you certainly won't find it here: Sardonicus is punished every time.
For once Castle should have left well enough alone.  The Punishment Poll is the only seriously weak thing in the entire film, which has a considerably better script and over-all better cast than most Castle outings.  The story, which shows influences from everything from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA to DRACULA to THE MAN THAT LAUGHED, concerns a grotesquely disfigured man who uses his wife to lure a noted specialist to his castle in the wilds of ""Gorslavia""--and who then proceeds to make every one's life as miserable as possible, and that's throwing roses at it.  Young women are molested, hung from the ceiling, nibbled on by leeches, and threatened with surgery designed to make them look as hideous as Sardonicus himself.
The cast is quite good, with Oskar Homolka a standout as Krull, Sardonicus' equally depraved servant.  The lovely Audrey Dalton is also memorable as Sardonicus' unwilling wife.  But the real star of the film is the make-up, which was quite famous in its day and is still capable of giving you a jolt.  And along the way we're treated to a number of campy Castle florishes that add to the fun.  But MR. SARDONICUS is surprisingly cohesive for a Castle movie, and it moves along at a smart pace and has an interestingly atmospheric look.

In the good old days (which weren't really that good), the only way you could catch a little-known gem such as this film was to stay up really late watching TV. I remember coming across it after watching Psycho (which put my sister to sleep) and looking for something to ""wind down"" to afterwards. What I tuned in to was a tale about the aforementioned peasant who is goaded by his selfish spouse into digging up his father's grave to retrieve a winning lottery ticket that was buried with him. When he opens the casket, and the moon shines brightly on his old man's year-dead rotted puss, the unpleasant sight does something very very strange to his face. Of course he is rewarded with untold wealth (and the bonus of his wife killing herself), but at the cost of becoming an abhorrent social outcast, spending his days slurping liquid meals and performing cruel medical experiments on unwitting locals in search of a cure for his, um, countenance de rigeur.
This is probably the most original creepshow offering by 60s gimmickmeister/filmmaker William Castle, a relatively non-supernatural and not really that exciting melodrama which, nonetheless, manages to get under one's skin, much like the leeches used by Baron Sardonicus' one-eyed henchman to punish disobedient maidservants. This DVD release includes a pristine widescreen transfer (a plus for fans eagerly awaiting availability of this title), and director Castle's ""Punishment Poll"" interlude towards the end ..... this trademark gimmick may have been a novel diversion for its time, but in the context of an otherwise involving story, it seems trite and downright annoying to watch the smirking Castle counting imaginary audience pollsters for an obvious outcome (""suffer, and suffer, and SUFFER!""). But then, that's the other great thing about DVD releases: chapter advance!
These small complaints aside, this is definitely a title worth checking out; it creeped me out so much the first time I saw it on TV I couldn't even finish watching it ..... so now I finally know the whole story!

1672260,5,B00005V4XF,"William Castle never fails to amuse and entertain. Wherever he falls short in production values or his choices of acting talent, he comes up with the most unique ideas. MR. SARDONICUS is certainly one of his more contrived plots, and his characters are all stock characters...good guy, gal in distress, bad guy, bad guy's evil side-kick...it's all there. The plot is as thin as dental floss, and the film, for all it's narrative, could've been shortened by a half-hour. Enter Mr. Castle with a groovy idea to put all these silly characters and plot ideas into an entertaining flow of events, culminating with his traditional ""gimmick"". As silly as it is, I love this movie. Castle used minimal sets; black & white photography is crisp and clear (especially on this DVD release) and Castle's regular Von Dexter composed yet another eerie and superbly appropriate musical score. Castle is the perfect example of making the most with the least. Audrey Dalton was approaching ""over-the-hill"" when she made this, and she's absolutely gorgeous; her face has a certain characteristic so that lack of expression is actually an asset. Ronald Lewis, used regularly during the early 60's in exactly this type of role, does what he needs to do (whatever happened to him?). Guy Rolfe chews the scenery as the rich, poor-put-upon title character with vigor beyond the requirements. It's Oscar Homolka, the fine old character actor from the 40's (""I Remember Mama"") who actually transcends his role and commands attention. The film belongs to him. Then, again, there are the Castle touches, very much influenced by Hitchcock, in a bargain-basement kind of way. He leads the audience down every possible path, creates an eerie and somewhat suspenseful mood...then throws out his goofy and fun gimmick. I saw this in theatres when it first came out. As a kid, I was intrigued. As an adult, I'm amused and entertained, knowing now that I was totally taken in by Castle's style. The first time you see the ugly face, it can seriously disturb you.

7956119,4,B00005V4XF,"I take away a star from this review, primarily because of an ""untrue statement"" in the product description above, quote:

""Desperate to retrieve a winning lottery ticket, a greedy baron unearths his father's corpse.""

It should read:

""Desperate to retrieve a winning lottery ticket, a greedy wife NAGS her reluctant husband into defiling his father's grave to retrieve the ticket from the pocket of a jacket in which he was buried.""

Remember that the wife, the husband, and his late father were merely peasant farmers living on modest means.  The husband didn't become a ""Baron,"" greedy or otherwise, until he cashed in the lottery ticket and bought his fancy home and property - allowing him to ""acquire"" his title of ""Baron.""

Anyway, I suspect this was William Castle's way of trying to copycat the ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" movies of 1931. All 3 movies have one commonality - a strange servant. Dracula had his Renfield, Frankenstein had his Igor, and Sardonicus had his Krull. ""Mr. Sardonicus"" was an OK movie for its time. And I like to show it to friends who are lottery fanatics (grin). Who knows ... if they (or I) won a lottery, maybe we'd end up with strange servants ourselves.

On the ""Punishment Poll"" and the notion that a merciful ending was never filmed, it's just not true.  Everyone who watches this DVD will *SEE* the merciful ending but may not recognize it as such.  Think about it for a second.  Krull rushes into the railroad station and explains his master's problem to the doctor.  The doctor explains to Krull that his master's problem was all ""in his mind"" ... and that this knowledge will free him from his curse and cure him.  Smiling sympathetically, Krull says he'll go tell his master right away and rushes out of the station.  Then, the doctor explains the cure to his girlfriend - and the screen fades to black.  The next thing you see is William Castle.  And the first words out of his mouth are, ""And that ends our story.""

Yup, Castle himself is telling you that you've JUST WATCHED the merciful ending.  And by saying the story has ended, he's implying that whatever follows is an ""extension"" of the story, not part of it.  If Castle had wanted to tell the audience that they chose mercy, all he'd have had to say was ""You just watched the merciful ending"" ... followed by a ""THE END"" screen.  Such an ending would have left his audience with two thoughts.  First, they'd picture Krull relaying the doctor's words to his master ... affecting his cure.  Secondly, the audience would be left wondering what they *would* have seen had they voted for no mercy.

Just one question as a postscript. In 1970, the rock band ""Spirit"" released an album titled Twelve Dreams of Dr Sardonicus. Whether the album had any relationship to the movie is something I've always been curious about ... even though one refers to a ""Dr."" and the other refers to a ""Mr."" If anyone knows the definitive answer to that, please leave a comment.

P.S. Ethical dilemma question (grin). For argument's sake, suppose you knew of a friend or relative who died & was buried with an unsigned $10,000,000 (or more) winning lottery ticket in his shirt pocket. Would you (A) just say, ""Ahh, what a shame,"" or (B) buy a good shovel and wait for nightfall? Hehe, I'm still thinking about that.",1466899200,,3299,4.699130434782608
7956120,4,B00005V4XF,"This 90-minute horror film builds from the first to the  last scene with no dumb subplots and an intensity found only in such movies as Don Siegel's 1956 INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, Don Coscarelli's 1988 PHANTASM II, and other unusual thrillers.  For years I was put off by the fact that William Castle directed and produced MR. SARDONICUS, because I dislike THE TINGLER & other movies that Castle had put out.
  MR. SARDONICUS is different!  It has the melancholy atmosphere of the 1930's Universal Studios horror films (DRACULA, THE MUMMY, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN) with a plot that is a modern, pretty ""sick"" story-line.
  If you're into something different in horror, without slasher overtones, this could be just the ticket for you.  This review is by Rock Hound.",1442620800,,769,4.953125

The nasty doc and his wife don't get along well.
How would this lead to her trying to find help for him from an old love interest?
The wife knows the guy is nasty, but puts no thought as to endangering the life of her old boyfriend.  Manservant Krull had one of his eyes purposely put out by the doc.  Yet good old Krull forgave him, and is totally loyal to him.  Townspeople fear for their daughters at the mention of Sardonicus, yet Krull has no problem finding chicks to attend with the lure of the doc throwing a party at the Sardonicus place.  The last thing the doc's dad did before dying peacefully in his sleep was buy a lottery ticket for his son and daughter in law.  Naturally, they bury the ticket with his old man, in spite of his having told them he really felt he had a winner this time.
The doc undergoes a major (if not impossible to believe) personality change.  Prior to his ""incident"", he's a milksop married to a shrew.  Afterward, he's a sadistic violent swine. There's mention of the doc experimenting on village girls.  One such experiment seems to be applying a bunch of leeches to the maid's face.  What was he hoping to learn beyond ""apply leech, leech sucks blood?""  Dr. Robert Cargrave rescues the maid, and later the maid moronically stops by his room (knowing she's in BIG trouble if she's caught) and asks Bob to promise he won't let Sardonicus leech her up anymore.  He promises, like he's in a position to control such things, and (big surprise) she's caught talking to Bob.  Krull threatens to releech her if she doesn't tell him what she was talking to the Dr. Bob about.  Rather than recount her short, lame, and obviously pointless conversation with Dr. Bob, the torture is set to begin.  One foot leech convinces her to tell everything she knows to Krull.  Dr. Bob concludes after a couple of hours of facial massage on Dr. Sardy with some hot towels (applied for very specific time periods) that his radical therapy has failed to cure the horribly disfigured face of Dr. Sardonicus, and there's nothing he can do.  Dr. Bob is afraid of trying anything experimental on Dr. Sardonicus, because he is afraid of injuring or killing the man who is holding him and his former girlfriend (Sardy's wife) hostage, threatening to torture and kill them if Dr. Bob doesn't try something experimental.

My suspension of disbelief only goes as far as being willing to accept the cause and resolution of Dr. Sardonicus' disfigurement.  All the other questionable stuff just keeps building to my total puzzlement as to how this has received so many five star ratings.",1413763200,,2651,4.616204690831556
