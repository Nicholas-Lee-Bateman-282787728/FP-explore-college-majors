5015101,5,B006S4D5BI,"In my state, a high school student must pass four of seven State tests, including Algebra I and Algebra II exams, in order to receive a high school diploma. So I purchased Jason Gibson's Volume I and Volume II Algebra I video courses for my 9th-grade nephew to use to help him review for his year-end high school Algebra I test. Many of the concepts evaluated on the State Algebra I test are taught/reviewed on these videos. My nephew has found Jason Gibson's video explanations to be clear and easily understood, as well as easily remembered. He is able to learn and review in minutes what he says would take him hours to figure out by re-reading his class notes and textbook. These lessons are so engaging for him that he will watch two to three lessons--one right after another--when he comes home from school each day. He and I are so glad that we purchased these videos. We will be very surprised if he does not pass his State Algebra I test this spring.",1325808000,3,959,4.485714285714286

5015103,5,B006S4D5BI,"I gave 5 stars for this DVD. It's an excellent tool for math dummies like me, I never had any knowleadge of math in me at all, (I couldn't even do basic multiplication and division) but now I got a placement level in college of Math Level 4! just by watching the Math Tutor DVD series alone.

Somehow all of the things I learned in high school just slipped through my brain. I don't remember exactly when I stopped trying to understand math, but I remember that, in school, I was left behind in classes so many times I lost count, and at some point I just lost the interests all together and decided to LET IT GO! because I thought I would never be able to keep up with the teachers and my classmates, esp. fractions, I never understood how come they can transform (simplify) themselves like that, but now I do, because of this DVD (and the whole series of Math Tutor DVD, I purchased and watched 8 of them so far, starting from Grade 1-7 Basic Math).

Jason Gibson is a great teacher, I recommend his line of products to everyone, and trust me no matter what age you are (I'm 30+), you'll never struggle with math again.

It WORKS!!!",1325635200,13,1134,4.314553990610329

5015117,5,B006S4D5BI,"I bought this for my kids who just completed 7th grade and both are advanced regarding their understanding of most concepts. and they work out of an 8th and 9th grade book, but one forgets everything he learned the day before.  We homeschool also.  These dvds really helped the kids understand concepts they did not fully grasp from the book, and it really helped them understand concepts in a fuller, deeper way.  As well, the dvds reinforced what they learned over the year, so the kids could better remember the concepts.  The concepts are taught from the very most simple form first, so if you are just learning the concept, you will learn just as if you were in a class.  We fastforwarded through some of the lessons and through the beginning of some that they only needed to further study the complex expressions.  I recommend this.dvd.for everyone, whether you are homeschooling, or in traditional schooling but need a thorough explanation of the concepts tolearn and or be reminded for test prep!  The teacher in the dvd is no frills, speaks clearly, and is very easy to understand.  No music, no colorful graphics or fancy video; just the math facts, presented clearly!  I will purchase the following dvds, the Algebra 1 vol2, geometry, and Algebra 2. I think the Algebra 1 volume 1perfectly matched our 7th grade math. but while we are in California, we are using more advanced books, more like an 8th grade math in public.schools.",1432857600,3,1441,4.778225806451613

I used it for a refresher because I hadn't used my math skills in many years. after as I went through these tutorials it all came back in no time. I highly recommend these for first time students and for old farts like me studying a new skill where math is required!
Also, Fractions thru Algebra Companion Worksheet CD is highly recommended to purchase along with these tutorials.
I am considering getting more of these tutorials to help in my further education also.",1424476800,,619,4.636363636363637

5015126,5,B006S4D5BI,"Jason is an amazing teacher. I am forced to take Intermediate Algebra in order to graduate with my Bachelors in Business Mgmt. I have struggled my entire life with math especially Fractions. I was actually contemplating dropping out of school because I had to take this class. I had a tutor who all but threw her hands up in the air and ran for the hills because I just was not getting it. At 37 years Algebra is extremely hard to understand when you never understood it through high school. I have only made it through the fractions portion of the DVD's and my mind is blown. In 37 years of life, no one has ever explained things to me the way he did. The fact that he explains each thing and then does 2-4 problems is extremely helpful. I am a visual learner which does not help when you are going to school online. For the first time ever, I am confident in fractions and not afraid of the Algebra class I have to take. I purchased Algebra 1 Volume 1 & 2 and Algebra 2 and am watching them all and taking plenty of notes before I try to take Algebra again. When Statistics class roles around, I will be purchasing his Probability and Statistics DVD also. Math has never came easy to me and has ALWAYS been a struggle which was hard when your older brother is math genius and was doing college level math problems when he was 6, so I always stayed away from the Math classes to keep my GPA up as I did fairly well in all other areas of school. I am confident now that I will maintain my 3.8 GPA after taking Algebra due to Jason and his method of teaching. Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!",1415750400,5,1591,4.2026143790849675

5015128,3,B006S4D5BI,"Everyone seems to love this, and I can't say that it is horrible, but it does not cover anything in our algebra book that wasn't already covered in a previous year.  It is on the level of my 9 year old twins. I have them watching it instead of my 13 year old because he already knew all of what is on this disk, and he is only doing pre-algebra.  I noticed that much of what is covered on this disk is included in the 4th grade book my twins are doing now.  We do not do common core!  We do real math, and this disk just seems so remedial.  I don't think I will buy the second course because I'm afraid it won't cover anything we haven't already done.  So, while I'm glad I can use it for my girls, I bought this for my 8th grader, who really cannot use this disk.",1413158400,,764,3.9285714285714284

5015133,5,B006S4D5BI,"The Algebra 1, volume 1 and 2 dvd's are great. Don't  expect a professional studio grade dvd. But the tutor is very clear and engaging. Explanations are very detailed. Some people may find them too slow, but you can always FF if you know what he is talking about. My son took algebra 1 in eighth grade and really struggled, partly because the teacher was burned out. He will take algebra 1 in 9th grade again and these dvd's are giving him some good summer review. He actually feels good going at his own pace and is able to grasp the concepts. Worth every penny. I almost had my son take a two week summer algebra camp, but honestly, I think he will get more out of these dvd's. I would say if your kid is getting a C or less is algebra 1, get these dvd's. They would probably help during the school year too. Wish I had done that. Good review if you forget or don't understand what was taught in the classroom. You can just put in the dvd and go to the particular topic.",1403654400,,972,4.170212765957447

Now the bad news.  The content is woefully insufficient.  Compared to another product that I bought (Chalk Dust), the Algebra I Tutor videos leave you wanting/needing more but that is all  that they provide.  It is way too brief.

Support from the company is simply horrible. I contacted them about one of the disks being defective thinking that they  would provide a replacement disk.  No such luck.  They refused to replace the defective disk!

I would not recommend this  product to learn  from.  I would definitely suggest that you consider the Chalk Dust Algebra Course instead.  It costs more but it is light years ahead of this Algebra tutor...",1365379200,8,761,4.874015748031496

The big problem is I never went beyond College Algebra 1 and 2, and that was over 10 years ago, and due to lack of use, I've pretty much forgot it all again.  Back in high school, I passed standard algebra with fairly average grades at best, and was never exposed to trig at all.  So you can color me desperate for a ""crash course"" solution to basically getting not only calculus in my head so I can pass a few classes to keep my job, but also provide a total review of even some basic math skills I've forgotten.  I have forgotten pretty much all of algebra as well due to lack of use, and I have never been exposed to trig, a prerequisite of learning Calculus.

In short, I basically have to learn it ALL.  And FAST.

I  bought a few of these DVDs (featuring Jason Gibson) because of all the high reviews on Amazon.  WOW!  Worth every penny.  The first disc I popped in was the 1st-7th Grade Math DVD.  Jason Gibson's teaching style alone actually attracted my kids into the TV room.  All 3 of them (aged 6 to 14) all eventually wound up sitting next to me and watching the DVD with me!  It immediately solved several different areas that my kids were struggling with that I didn't even know they were having problems with (Egad, bad Dad!).  I was impressed both by the way Jason Gibson instructs (my kids like him, which says it all) and the way he repeats each lesson multiple times to make sure you ""get it"" before moving on to the next lesson/topic.  TOTALLY perfect for me, because I really need my hand held like a little kid as I crash my way from basic mathematics up through algebra, trig, and calc.  Embarrassing to admit all of this, but hey, math is really tough for most of us, and that's if we didn't forget it altogether since high school or college.

I do not have thousands and thousands of dollars in my pocket for prerequisite/catch-up pre-calc college courses or personal tutors in prep for my calculus classes.  I'm lucky to get a tax return.  What I DID do, however, especially after seeing the immediate results with my kids, is I bought the whole entire ""Math Tutor"" DVD set (making sure Jason Gibson is the instructor), I think I paid about $250-300 here on Amazon for all of them combined.  They are now a large ""Math Tutor Library"" sitting in my TV room that both myself and the kids can access at any time for any cramming or homework assistance we may need.

This DVD set is a total jackpot, exactly what I needed, and also acts as the perfect ""good grade insurance"" for my kids.  As a Dad, I feel I've helped my kids with their homework in the best possible way I possibly could have - I have basically brought into my home a friendly, permanent, personal, likeable, 24/7-available, Ph. D-level Math Tutor of the highest caliber for my kids who covers nearly every single topic of mathematics that my kids will experience in their studies and in real life.  This includes college-level instruction.

I could not be any happier with this purchase, so much so that I bought ALL of these Math Tutor DVDs just so I could have the entire set and cover every base no matter what classes my or any of my kids will ever take.

Looking forward to coming back in a year or so after I take my own classes to post the results of using these DVDs to basically save my butt, job, and family's well-being).

I thought a DVD might be helpful but I had no idea the results would be this incredible. Thank you very much for your product. I highly recommend it to anyone.,1328572800,,577,3.7768595041322315
5015153,5,B006S4D5BI,My son was very behind in math. We got the Pre Algebra Volume 1 & 2 and Algebra 1 Volume 1 & 2 and he is able to watch the videos by himself and then he does the CD's.

8503692,5,B006S4D5BI,"I use all of the Tutor Jason videos with my two homeschooled sons.  I am fairly good at doing math, but do not ""speak math"" or explain it very well.  Jason is an excellent teacher who uses lots of examples to make ""scary"" math much less intimidating.  I have purchased and used 4 of Jason's DVDs, and will keep purchasing as we move forward.  I only wish there were workbooks I could buy of practice problems that correspond to the sections for some follow-up practice or spiral review.",1509580800,,486,4.488636363636363

8503694,5,B006S4D5BI,Jason is great! You really need to be prepared to put in the time though since the recordings are long. Definitely worth the price and time for anyone of any age who needs help with math.,1490054400,,187,4.222222222222222
8503695,3,B006S4D5BI,"Jason communicates very well and gives examples which are very intuitive and practical. Jason is not a pure mathematician, but an engineer or physics person, more of an applied mathematician. What is clear is that he does not define concepts precisely. On the very first lesson, he has an error in his explanation of the inequality. He fails to define the word ""or"" and ""and."" He uses his own intuition in explaining an example which is inconsistent with the standard mathematical notation. This is a""how to do it"" DVD. Jason's approach does not provide accurate definitions and structure to algebra. Sometimes he alludes to the theory, but glosses over it in such a way that a student would not understand what he is talking about. The value of this DVD would be an introduction to a formal algebra course. If a student were to learn algebra with this DVD, they would not be prepared for the precise type of reason to major in mathematics. I rated the DVD with 3 stars, because I cannot say it is a bad DVD, but it is clearly inadequate in content of algebra.",1486425600,,1060,4.613756613756614
8503696,5,B006S4D5BI,"I purchased these DVDs and now I work for NASA!!!  Just kidding! Seriously though these DVDs are the best.  I was never good in math and I wanted to make sure my son didn't end up hating math like me. Some complain that the lessons are boring but my 12yr old really enjoys them and is totally engaged.  You're not going to get fireworks and cartwheels, just the facts.  Jason explains things in such a simple and no-nonsense way.  I watch the lessons with my son and we work the problems out together.  I'm now realizing that I'm pretty good in math and it's actually fun to do. If you think you can't do math, you can!  You can watch the lessons over and over as many times as you need to.  You are in the privacy of your own home and no one is judging you. Buy these DVDs for your kids and yourself!  It's never too late to learn!  For you geniuses out there that don't need Jason's help, that's fine but for the rest of us, we'll just keep chugging along.",1481241600,,958,4.157608695652174

8503701,5,B006S4D5BI,"Solid and a great help for my child. I watch it along with him. I like the no frills approach. It is direct and non hyped up with any needless distractions.

 My son was struggling with Algebra- he is quite capable of learning the subject, but disliked it passionately. This is a way to review and learn prior to moving along to Alg 2.

 I am now considering more of the videos for my other children as a review over the summer or in tandem with their current math. Very good!",1454198400,2,476,4.197802197802198
