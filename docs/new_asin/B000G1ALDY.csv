2598870,1,B000G1ALDY,"A friend of mine and I enjoy watching horror, and we have seen some really bad flicks. That said, I want to explain why the Breed isn't worth the dvd its printed on.

The acting is completely lackluster, and the lines they say are even more boring and uneventful. The movie never makes you care about the well-being of these characters, because they are boring beyond belief.

The storyline is overused and dull: dogs are bred on this certain island in the movie to 'make plans'. oooooh scary huh? Well it gets worse. Their is very little death and blood (thought this was a HORROR movie..) and the dogs predominately appear to be cuddly and nice instead of Evil or Mutated.

I cannot really stress enough in words how sad it is that people would give this anything more than one star (its the minimum) I'm sick and tired of these horror flicks that aren't scary, and I'm really done with directors that don't know how to make an interesting movie. Hollywood spills out all these horror movies, and they don't take the time to really make a decent one that will please horror and or gore fans.

Let me just say in closing, you could take a nap and be better served than sitting thru this boring and horribly acted and written (as well as directed) FARCE!",1167782400,6,1254,4.4868421052631575
2598871,4,B000G1ALDY,"I watched a pre-release of ""The Breed"" and I honestly enjoyed it. Of course it has it's flaws for instance when Michelle Rodriguez's character get a bow shot through her leg... throughout the rest of the film she sometimes limps and sometimes doesn't. She also does some amazing stunts with her leg hurt. It's something minor but it sticks out. The movie is a good camp style horror flick, no deep story line, enough suspense and action and overall interesting. I enjoyed it. The acting was well done but like I said, it has some mistakes here and there. Enjoy whenever the hell this film get's released",1159833600,6,603,4.644859813084112

2598883,5,B000G1ALDY,"The  movie  starts  off  with  a  group  of  people  arriving  at  a  remote  island  for  a  weekend  of  relaxation.  Actually  the  movie  starts  off  with  a  man  &  his  wife  or  his  girlfriend  who  were  enjoying  a  ride  in  their  boat  on  the  sea  &  come  across  an  island.  The  girl  goes  off  exploring  claiming  to  have  some  privacy  to  go  to  the  bathroom  or  something.  She  hears  something  in  the  bushes,  she  doesn't  think  much  of  it  at  first,  Then  the  dogs  come  out  of  nowhere  forcing  her  to  retreat  back  to  the  boat.  But  she  doesn't  make  it  back,  &  the  other  person  goes  off  looking  for  her  &  finds  her  dead,  he  lives  long  enough  to  tell  the  group  of  kids  that  arrived  that  the  dogs  didn't  want  them  there.  They  only  had  about  2  or  3  nights  before  the  dogs  came  to  terrorize  them,  first  they're  greeted  by  a  German  shepherd  puppy  who  eventually  starts  acting  weird  &  then  runs  out  the  door.  As  they  go  to  retrieve  the  pup  an  adult  dog  suddenly  appears,  more  dogs  arrive  trapping  them  inside  the  cabin.  The  part  where  they  saw  the  plane  missing  &  saw  it  floating  away  &  seeing  the  dogs  on  top  of  the  wings  guarding  the  plane  to  keep  them  from  getting  to  it  &  leaving  is  strange  &  good.  They  had  seen  an  old  car  in  the  garage  that  they  had  to  get  to.  Soon  the  dogs  are  breaking  into  making  them  retreat  to  the  attic  in  the  house  &  forcing  them  to  escape.  &  They  fight  the  dogs  with  a  bow  &  arrow,  run  over  a  few  of  them  once  they  get  the  car  going.  This  is  truly  a  man VS  dog  movie.  Rumor  had  it  that  some  people  had  brought  the  dogs  to  the  island  to  do  some  scientific  experiments  on  them.  But  things  went  wrong  during  the  experiment,  &  the  dogs  ended  up  killing  the  scientists.  We  assume  that's  what  happened  anyways,  the  dogs  were  given  injections  by  scientists  from  the  government,  doing  classified  or  private  research  &  tampering  with  dog  like  behavior,  but  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that's  what  really  happened  to  the  dogs.  No  proof  as  to  why  the  dogs  are  the  way  that  they  are.  To  me  the  dogs  blame  all  humans  for  their  condition.  Not  just  some  humans.  All  humans!!  &  its  time  for  them  to  wreak  havoc, spare  no  one,  &  show  humans  who  are  really  in  charge  if  your  in  their  territory!  Now  anyone  who  visits  the  island  will  be  attacked  by  the  dogs  who  behave  like  wolves,  except  worse.  The  group  choosing  to  try  &  forget  about  the  dogs  when  they  got  trapped  in  the  cabin  earlier  on  in  the  movie  was  the  hard  part.  To  try  &  enjoy  their  weekend  vacation,  they  thought  they  were  safe  but  they  weren't!  This  one  does  have  its  scary  moments,  one  of  them  messing  with  the  breaker box  several  times,  &  getting  surprised  by  one  of  the  dogs  in  the  basement.  I  don't  think  anyone  lived  in  this  movie.  Only  a  couple  of  people  manage  to  get  off  the  island,  2  out  of  5  of  them,  in  a  boat  that  was  left  at  a  dock,  &  they  thought  their  troubles  with  the  dogs  were  over.  Somehow  at  least  one  of  the  dogs  had  gotten  on  board  the  boat  &  had  gotten  below  the  deck  waiting  to  surprise  whoever  opens  the  door  to  go  below.  Okay,  it  doesn't  say  whether  or  not  they  had  finally  had  their  victory  over  the  dogs,  but  I  would  have  liked  to  of  known  what  really  happened  at  the  end  of  this  movie.  I  guess  we'll  never  know.  Some  movies  just  end  this  way  leaving  us  guessing.  Only  the  producer  or  director  could  tell  us  whether  or  not  we  were  right  about  what  we  thought.  Who  really  won  in  the  end?  So  to  answer  your  questions  can  your  worst  imagination  come  true  Yes!  that  had  to  be  the  best  scare  in  the  entire  movie  at  the  very  end,  they  open  the  door  going  below  deck  on  the  sail  boat,  &  this  dog  comes  charging!  Then  everything  goes  off  the  air,  the  people  battling  the  dog  or  the  dogs  conquering  every  last  human  being  in  the  very  end  isn't  filmed  at  all.  Yes  they  would  have  to  make  a  part  2  &  start  at  the  very  end  when  those  2  got  on  board  the  sail  boat,  &  learned  they  had  a  scary  passenger!!!!
These  dogs  looked  them  right  in  the  eyes,  &  it  was  difficult  for  them  to  hide  their  fear!  Dogs  have  good  sense  of  smell  &  that's  why!  Either  they  were  tame  at  one  time  &  somebody  made  them  crazy,  I  couldn't  say.  They  were  no  ordinary  behaved  dogs!  This  movie  has  the  dogs  barking,  howling, snarling,  growling,  Not  to  mention  looking  innocent  at  times,  as  if  they're  asking  a  question,  (What  did  you  humans  do  to  us?)  at  least  they're  alerting  the  humans  when  they're  attacking.  Scary  thrills,  those  heart  pounding  scary  moments?  Yes, Yes, &  Yes!!!!!!!
I've  learned  at  least  some  things  about  dogs.  You  don't  run  from  them,  not  from  creatures  who  get  excited  easily.
This  is  dog  world,  dog  instinct,  dog  territory,  &  dog  Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!",1474329600,,5461,4.225255972696246
2598884,5,B000G1ALDY,"The Breed (2006) Rated R 1HR 31Min
Comedy, Horror, Thriller (info via IMDB)

There is very little comedy here and this is not one of those low budget bad on purpose slap-stick type of movies. There maybe some bantering in the opening moments but this bad boy gets serious pretty quickly, despite that it's a very FUN film for the thriller/horror fan.

Considering I have a collection of thousands of movies from black & white to modern spanning all genres, I write very few reviews for movies. No time and no talent in that area, but this movie is a bit of a hidden gem and I couldn't keep it to myself!

I have been becoming more of a horror fan as of late. I have not been the biggest Wes Craven fan to this point, and this is IMO not only a very underrated film, but surely one of his best.

This movie has a brisk pace, never getting boring. It's not perfect but it IS very entertaining and I am glad I stumbled onto it. Michele Rodriguez is beautiful and for a group of young actors in this type of movie the acting is pretty darn good.

I seldom buy DVDs anymore because I get sick of replacing them with Bluray which seems to happen often. I got a deal on this at a local store so what the heck. Upconverted the picture is better than decent, the 5.1 track is very good as well. Also includes English & Spanish subtitles which is MUCH appreciated. If you don't want to spring for the Bluray, I do not think you will be disappointed at all in this DVD. However, this movie is good enough for multiple viewings and depending upon the person, you may want to research some reviews of the Bluray which I have not personally seen.

Bottom line, Excellent!",1470009600,,1657,4.294871794871795

2598906,3,B000G1ALDY,"Two brothers (played by Oliver Hudson and Eric Lively) fly to a remote island with three of their friends.  They plan to stay in their dead uncle's cabin and have fun.  For the longest time all they do is cavort, have inane ""remember when"" conversations, and chat about sex and booze.  No one comes across as being overly responsible or all that bright, considering what follows.  They are also uniformly unlikable.  Their conversations feel forced and unnatural (they talk about what they're doing as they are doing it).  They flirt and that too feels phony.  They are like a group of people who've just met but who are then told to pretend they've known each other for all of their lives.  It's this obvious disconnect that makes it difficult to care about what happens to them when this raging pack of dogs start attacking them en masse.  Speaking of which, how did that island support that many dogs for that many years with no obvious food source except the dogs eating their own, which would have seriously limited their number quite quickly.  Who is the last dog standing supposed to eat?

At worst, this is merely mundane.  Other than stealing story ideas from much better films.............eh.",1425945600,,1202,4.781553398058253

2598909,2,B000G1ALDY,"I'm more a dog lover than a cat lover. I tolerate cats, and that's about it. Anyway, this DVD came in to my library in December for some reason that defies logic and reason. They're not in the habit of ordering in horror films, so I'm left to assume this was a donation from someone who bought the DVD and realized it had no place in their permanent collection.
Wes Craven slapped his name on this movie as an executive producer, and that may entice some people, but I'm more inclined to call it a coin toss. The Breed ironically enough came up tails.

Five twenty-somethings head out to a deserted island owned by the uncle of the two brothers leading the weekend of heavy drinking and hijinks. The characters are set up pretty quickly, but I've long since forgotten any of the characters' names. The brother flying the plane is the older, slacker of a brother who has convinced his younger, studious brother to ditch university the week before his finals so they can spend some time together. Along with them is the younger brother's girlfriend, played by Rodriguez, and is also the ex-boyfriend of the older brother--ooh, tension. There's also a longtime friend of the brothers played by Taryn Manning, and a flirtatious yet platonic friend who is friends with them all. He's also black, and I'll be damned if he didn't end up being the first of the group of five to die in the film.

Okay, first gripe. It's the twenty-first century and I'd have thought we, as a society, have moved on from such hackneyed, lazy, and borderline racist treatment of what amounts to a token black member to the cast of characters. Killing the black guy first should be left to parody, so when done in a serious film, I lose interest. Yes, a blond white chick dies in the first five minutes of the movie, but she's there solely as part of an excuse to provide the escape route for the group of five. And the ""the black guy's going to die first"" vibe is so overt, it's kind of comical.

Moving on, the threat on the island comes in the form of a pack of wild, possibly rabid dogs. They've lived on the island for years in a feral state and are out for blood, even though they seem to enjoy teasing out cheap scares by hiding in bushes half the time. There are dozens of dogs on the island, so why they sneak about is beyond me. After a puppy wanders up to the five friends at the cabin, they cuddle up to the critter with no questions about where it came from or to whom it belongs. Oh, they ask questions, but do nothing to follow up on their fleeting curiosity--Oh look, a puppy on a deserted island, can I keep him?

I'm grateful that the director opted for real dogs, mostly German shepherds, to be in the film as opposed to some cartoonish CGI trash. On the DVD cover, the dogs in the foreground and exaggerated to a ridiculous level. If the disproportional heads and paws are meant to denote menace, the guy who Photoshopped the cover failed miserably. The dogs--and the dog dummies that take brutal beating during the more gruesome spots--are quite imposing that to an admirable makeup job and good training. If you saw a pack of dogs like that standing on the crest of a hill, you'd probably become incontinent.

The acting ranges from mediocre to dreadful. Taryn Manning is particularly shaky in her performance, as she's bitten by one of the dogs early on and starts to change in personality as whatever ""disease"" takes hold on her. Unfortunately, she already looked like a strung out junkie when the film started, so her supposed descent is unremarkable. And the writing for her character is sporadic, as she starts to change in mood at one point, then just becomes ill the next, then aggressive again. It's like the screenwriters couldn't make up their mind which way to go with that aspect of the story.

The chills and spills are nothing new, but most are accomplished fairly well. But when the dogs are busting through windows and walls, I had to wonder why they didn't do that from the beginning. Instead, they tease and taunt the people on the island, as if they're not just ravenous but evil and a little bit more intelligent than your average dog. And there is a scene so out of place in the movie in both style and tempo, I am convinced you'll know it when you see it. Here's a hint: It involves archery.

Overall, it's an uneven movie with a very predictable ending that's telegraphed early on. If there's nothing left to rent from Blockbuster, Netflix, or your local library, give this one a shot for some cheap scares. For me, I think The Breed needs to be spayed or neutered.",1421193600,,4582,4.5

I'm all for good cheesy horrors and I found this to very entertaining, the story is quite different and a bit more original than usual horrors, there has been a few dog horrors in the past but I think this one is pulled off with good style and effect, basically the plot is a group of college kids fly to a remote island for a party, only to find its been taken over by a new breed of savage killer dogs, as the story progresses we discover these are no ordinary animals, its a great set up for some painful savage bloody kills and gore, the dogs all look really scary especially if your not a big dog lover, I think as dogs being a common fear for some people it makes them a more grounded villain for a horror, the cast is all ok, Michelle Rodriguez of course being probably the most famous face in the movie, personally I would say see it if you haven't already, its not the best horror ever but its highly enjoyable and genuinely creepy and worth going back too, im shocked that somebody hasn't tried to make a sequel already.",1419379200,,1099,4.213270142180095

2598938,2,B000G1ALDY,"This has got to be one of the cheesiest movies yet about slasher dogs. This is not even on the level of ""Cujo"". At least in Cugo he was a huge drooling creepy dog; all dirty, nasty, and bloody. Ew!!! Wouldn't want to run into that dog in a dark alley. And all it took was one Cujo to creep you out. The premise of the movie is: Five friends, three guys/two gals (Why do these slasher films always have more guys than girls?), make a trip to a remote island to drink, slum, and look sexy and then find out there are killer dogs on the island and try to evade the dogs and find a way to get off the island.  It's the usual slasher formula except it has dogs, real dogs. The acting in this movie is actually above par for a teen/slasher movie. The problem is the dogs. They just look too cute. There are a couple of scenes when the dogs with floppy ears tilt their head and give you that ""What's up?"" look, just too cute! The stunts are not believable because the dogs are not ferocious or scary looking. As in these usual slasher movies, the dog chews, ahem! I mean characters, make the dumbest mistakes throughout the movie. That's a given though in slasher movies. So it didn't bother me too much since I was expecting it. I was expecting the dogs to turn into werewolves or monster dogs. The poster/cover for this movie is really deceiving; it makes the dogs look much bigger and scarier than they are in the movie. I also expected the characters who were bitten to mutate into awesome ferocious dogs. That would have been the bomb! But no, no such thing. There was no development about what happens when the humans get bitten or what exactly happened to the dogs in the lab. There are no scenes of dead mutated dogs in the lab or dogs suspended in fluid or even grossly mutated dead pups. C'mon, couldn't the writer think of anything good? A real disapointment. This movie is not even scary. Good to watch to see some good dog acting and cute dogs but can see that on Animal Planet. This is definitely not a case the Xfiles would have investigated. Would have been too boring for Mulder.

I watched it for free on Amazon Prime. There were some problems with distortion both on the laptop and on the Kindle Fire (1st gen). Also problems with streaming as it had to stop the movie twice for streaming which was not really a problem since there was no real climax or scary moments. If I had been watching Cujo, I would have been really annoyed with the streaming. Want to watch a movie about killer dogs? Watch Cujo. The Grey is also another good movie but not as scary as Cujo. If you can watch this movie for free, then try it out but don't go out of your way for this. Wait for it on cable or Amazon Prime. There are also plenty of good werewolf movies if you want that dog/monster fix.",1351555200,,2788,4.278409090909091

It's a fairly typical storyline with a common descriptive snippet, which reads like so many others I've read lately:

""A group of (insert number here) friends (or college kids) venture off to a remote (island, wilderness cabin, lodge) and soon find that they (are not alone, must match wits with, or fall victim to) some (wild beast, monster, insane killer, demonic entity, or other life threatening scenario they are scarcely equipped to handle).""

But hey, that's a horror movie.

That said, it was a watchable film with some good tension, suspense, action and thrills, and also some nice bikini scenes. The editing was great, nice cuts, good timing, and creative dissolves, and the dog handlers had their hands busy. Great canine cast and excellent interaction and combat moments between human and dog. Truly some impressive stunts and action involving the dogs and people. That stuff can't be easy to just pull off so kudos to the crew for that.

Character development is a little poor, I didn't find them all too convincing, but for the most part it worked well enough. Sometimes you just have to put aside such details and enjoy the films other good qualities.

Wes Craven's name is on it but in my opinion it doesn't live up to the reputation of some of his classics.

As a whole the film works okay, I'd probably watch it again and pick up on some things I may have missed, but it didn't peak my meter as far as horror films are concerned. As I mentioned the suspense is there -- although maybe short lived at times since the attacks and shocks are almost predictable -- but the horror is lacking a bit.

You would expect a pack of marauding dogs to be a bit more persistent and savage, but maybe that is one plot point the writers are trying make... it is hinted that the dogs have a higher than average canine intelligence.

There is a hint at possible clandestine research on the dogs, possibly performed at a facility located on the island, officially known for training seeing-eye dogs, but maybe something more sinister was going on behind the scenes. The place is now deserted and the dogs are running wild, so who knows. We're not given enough information or clues.

We're also kind of led to believe that perhaps some mutated rabies virus has infected the dogs and was passed along to a couple of the humans because they begin exhibiting strange symptoms, almost sympathetic with the dogs.

Those sub plots are lightly glanced over. They could have made for a more interesting film, but it is obvious the filmmakers were only focusing on the horror and suspense of people pitted against wild dogs, regardless of however those dogs may have became that way.

Generally speaking it's a good film, well made, decent acting, directing, great camera work, editing, and great special effects too, but it seems to me that the loose ends remaining, with all the what if and what of, could have been tied together better to completely satisfy the audience.

Worth the watch though, there are enough satisfying moments, suspense and thrills that make this a very entertaining film.",1335571200,,3378,4.705084745762712

The acting is decent enough seeing how I didn't expect much to begin with. I had low expectations when I watched the film so I was pleasantly surprised in some areas. By how the film ended I wouldn't be surprised if many sequels to this will follow.

2598953,3,B000G1ALDY,"The Breed (2006) is a pretty effective animal attacks type thriller, where a pack of wild genetically engineered dogs, terrorizes a group on vacation on a remote island.  The story gets whacky in places, but not excessively so, as mostly real dogs appear to have been used throughout the film.

Brothers John (Oliver Hudson) and Matt (Eric Lively) have inherited a cabin on a huge island, and are flying there in a seaplane, along with some of their friends, for a weekend of fun.  Also in the party is Sara (Taryn Manning), Noah (Hill Harper), and Matt's girlfriend Nicki (Michelle Rodriguez).

The group settles in and is having a great time, when a puppy unexpectedly shows up at the cabin.  Night falls, and when the young pup runs out of the house, Sara and John go out to look for him, and are surprised when a huge dog appears, and sinks its teeth into Sara's leg.  Matt patches up Sara's wound, but while out in the woods the next day, the guys witness a man being attacked by several dogs.  Running back to the cabin, the group is followed by a pack of nasty canines.  A dog has Nicki's leg in his jaws, so Matt fires an arrow at the beast, but unfortunately his aim is off, and the arrow sinks into Nicki's calf.  Barricaded in the cabin, with dogs surrounding them, the vacationers realize that they are in a battle for their lives.

The Breed nicely introduces its characters, clues you into their interpersonal history, and then flows along pretty briskly, once the dogs arrive and start to get frisky.  The attack scenes with the dogs are staged well, nicely featuring the animals and the actual actors (at least some of the time).  The film is heavy on the jump scares, and the music and the sound of dogs growling, is cranked way up during the attacks, to make things more dramatic.  Still, there are enough legitimate action scenes to generate some excitement, including a one nasty double impalement.  Bad leg and all, Nicki's athletic talents are put to the test, and she delivers the film's best one liner, ""Give Cujo my best"", just before setting off an explosion.

The films has many flaws, as the characters attempt some completely idiotic stunts, the story is loaded with junk science, and the geography of the ""island"" is completely unbelievable, but these kind of things are not completely unexpected in a B-movie like this.  With passable acting, and characters that are mostly likeable, The Breed is a pretty entertaining thriller, if you let a few things pass.  After being an assistant director for numerous well known productions, including Knight and Day, Walk the Line, Blow, and the Scream series, Nick Mastandrea assumes the director's chair for the first time.",1326931200,,2696,4.726495726495727

2598960,3,B000G1ALDY,"Well, the Breed is probably not THAT great because the movie is basically another ""kill all the teenagers one by one"" kind of horror film which is not much different from any number of slasher films out there.

One thing that's pretty funny to me is that, when the dogs were attacking the teens, many times you can tell the dogs were happy while supposedly tearing people apart.  The film directors should have cut away any scenes that showed the dogs wagging their tails because it seems really silly watching killer dogs wag their tail as they tear apart their delicious victims (and yes, I KNOW in reality quite often it appears like dogs are wagging their tails when they're actually eating at a dead body, but come on, the dogs in this movie are clearly happy).

I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting pretty tired of generic horror movies starting off by showing teens partying and having fun.  It's such a boring, typical way to start a movie and it's *really* starting to get on my nerves.

As for the story itself, well...

mutated dogs vicious enough to bring down a human being weren't *quite* as vicious as you're led to believe.  The dogs are actually normal-sized, very ordinary looking dogs.  They should have been created MUCH bigger and badder than they ended up.  They still pack a mean punch despite their regular size however.

The film contains a respectable amount of action and suspense, though you have to wait a good 30 minutes for things to pick up.

Overall, extremely dangerous dogs located on some island in the middle of nowhere while teens try to find a way to escape is a nice storyline, though the film had some funny moments as well such as one scene where the teens throw a dead dog outside in the yard of their cabin, a pack of wild dogs come up and start eating the dead mut, and the teens hurry back inside.  The teens really didn't NEED to hurry back inside during this particular moment since the vicious dogs were distracted by the dead dog.  Also, the one teen that kept tripping over everything in the dark was clumsy as heck, and yet, he was laughing about it the entire time.  Come on, there's NOTHING to laugh about when hungry dogs are outside waiting to kill you.  And the girl who had these amazing athletic skills by flipping over cars and flipping up and down houses and barns like Spiderman to escape the dogs was supposed to be believable?  No way!

2598961,5,B000G1ALDY,"OK, first off I would like to say that usually I'm not the biggest Wes Craven fan.  I never have thought his PG-13 horror films were worth much of anything and before this film the only good movie I ever thought Wes Craven ever directed/produced that well were the Night Mare On Elm Street films, the one series of movies I was told were scarier then anything else when I was little.  But this film was a really good movie, it was well worth the $7.50 I payed for it at Family Video.  The monsters in this movie were not only well developed, but also believable and the picture and sound quality of the film was done exceptionally well.  And I would also say that it was scarier then most of the Night Mare On Elm Street Films.",1225065600,3,727,4.246376811594203
2598962,4,B000G1ALDY,"Not since Cujo has man's best friend become his worst enemy.  Whereas the previous attacks were caused by rabies, this time around it's the result of genetic engineering gone wrong.

A group of young friends make their way to an isolated island where they expect to spend a wild time full of drinking, partying, and debauchery.  What they find instead is a large pack of vicious dogs protecting their island; or, as one character put it, ""scary-a@# lassies"" looking for food.  Although, one scene in which dogs are swimming after a person is completely hilarious, because we all know that in the water, human is far superior.  It would have just been a matter of holding breath, and drowning a few dogs.  As for real plot, it's simply Darwinian, survival of the fittest.

I'm sure there is a morality lesson about playing God in there somewhere, but I didn't care and I hardly noticed.

With nice special effects, production, cinematography, and pretty fair acting, it's what one would expect from a Wes Craven production.  The acting is particularly astute (especially the four-legged actors), and aside from Michelle Rodriguez, the cast is comprised of pretty good young actors who we've all seen before, but can't name.  Actually, the thing that's great about Rodriguez is crystal clear in this movie.  Even as a leading lady, she can't shake the ""tough"" chick persona.  I was waiting for her to snap a dog's spine over her knee during the entire movie.

It has typical horror elements, like the moron who descends into the basement towards his demise - in this case genetically engineered, mutant dogs with a taste for human flesh - is waiting in the dark.  At times the idiocy makes you want to scream at the screen, ""Climb a tree genius!""  Thankfully, however, the ""black guy dies first""-rule isn't followed until Noah (Hill Harper) provides some laughs with funny one-liners like ""crazy-a&* old yellers"".  Given the concept, it's more advanced than one would think, with one great scene where the dogs make their eventual assault on the cabin - straight from a classic zombie movie.  The story and character development is crisp, creating just enough empathy for the characters and their predicament, however unreal it may be.

2598973,3,B000G1ALDY,"This movie was better than I expected it would be. The script allowed for some genuine character development. The 20's-somethings who gather on this remote island for a weekend vacation are given a range of sympathetic qualities, some stake in life - so we care about their fates.

It's the dogs who are the real stars of this show though. The close-ups of their intent brown eyes draw you into the canine mind. The producers/director of this film prided themselves on the fact that no computer-generated graphics were used. All the dogs in action are real dogs. Some dogs were Hollywood veterans imported to the site of the film shoot (which was South Africa) with their trainers; others were local dogs enlisted and trained on the spot.

The reasons given for the dogs' aggression in the movie are unfortunately muddled - a defect in the plot line. On the one hand, the young people discover that these dogs are the result of some genetic engineering that seemed to have been wrought on the dogs' ancestors. But on the other hand, people who are bitten by the dogs soon develop some strange illness, a malaise spotted with outbreaks of rage. This would suggest a viral or bacterial infection that isn't quite rabies, but that threatens to be a fatal biological time-bomb nonetheless. We are almost led to suspect a transmission of werewolf tendencies, recreating Lon Chaney's Jr.'s frequent film fate.

As impressive as the dogs frequently are, they could have been used to greater effect. Their attacks are too sudden and predictable. There is none of the slowly gathering menace found in ""The Birds.""

Also, one of the characters is made to pronounce the all-too-trite indictment of any meddling with nature. To the extent that an eccentric uncle's genetic engineering is held responsible for these dogs' temperaments, he receives the ultimate reproof - ""He was trying to play God!"" Oh, if only once biological tinkering was allowed to result in something other than a tragic lesson against hubris.

This DVD doesn't have any Director's Commentary on it, which was a little disappointing. Since horror mavens Wes Craven and Nick Mastandrea were both involved in the making of this film, it would have been informative to hear their tag-along philosophizing about the genre.

However, there is an interesting extra showing how the dogs were trained and made to appear to be crunching into their victims. Hardly any of the human stars of this movie were left unscathed by the rehearsals or actual filmings. The dogs sometimes missed their decoy targets and chomped into real flesh. So the attacks you see are often more fact than fiction.

Overall, this movie probably won't be one of the most memorable you'll ever watch, but it does have some bite to it.",1192233600,10,2758,4.905579399141631

Granted, some of the dialog was insipid and some of the characters really did deserve to be chewed on by wild dogs, but I felt that (unlike most horror movies) the cast's actions and reactions were reasonable. The acting was better than average for this genre, the story was interesting, and the dog scenes were quite impressive considering that (despite some misinformation in other reviews) there was no CGI involved. They actually relied on well-trained attack dogs to perform all the stunts. Judging from my cat's growling and hissing, the dog's acting was exceptional. Also, for us animal lovers, be sure to view the special features to see the clever ways they avoided hurting any of the dogs during the filming. It seems that some of the actors actually did get chewed on, but at least the dogs were safe.

Some reviewers suffer from critical snobbery. They are anxious to find fault in films to convince us of their sophistication. Let's face it, this movie isn't going to end up on Roger Ebert's top ten list, but it definitely deserves more than one or two stars.

2598977,4,B000G1ALDY,"Dogs - those lovable, tail-wagging, stick-fetching, ruff'n'tumble quadrupeds who are one of our most frequent animal companions on this planet - can be fairly scary in real life if they're ticked off at you and snarling like a Harley Davidson engine trying to turn over; but making them genuinely scary in movies and other tales has often been a tough task.  Maybe it's just too easy to envision a big lovable goof of a german shepherd growling and stalking on cue like he's been trained to, but then reverting to chasing his tale or pestering for doggie biscuits as soon as he knows his performance is over, but the fright factor doesn't usually work with dogs like it does their cousins the wolves, or with various reptiles.  Usually, anyway.  ""The Breed"" is one of the few that's succeeded.  The canines here are cunning, big, aggressive and fast, and not at all hard to believe could be produced by a mean-spirited breeding program using conventional, non-futuristic, steroids.

  It's five friends vacationing on an island where a reclusive uncle (recently deceased) kept a nice beach house, who encounter the Breed, descendants of an old secert program at a complex (apparantly government-owned or sponsored) on the other side of the island.  There are vague clues that there may have been people suspicious about what was really going on at the compound, but nothing definate.  ""The Breed"" doesn't go indepth into the backstory, preferring to drop in a kind of broad opening into the Breed's origins and let viewers draw their own conclusions. Another intriguing area where the movie doesn't spell out exactly what's happening - and thus preserves a good aura of mystery - is the unusual 'link' that forms between surviving victims of the pack and the dogs themselves.  Having already established the dogs as realistic, it adds in something very strange but keeps it feeling real, making it more eerie and enhancing the whole movie. ""The Breed"" takes its time building into the man vs. beast action, creates genuine tension, and is largely devoid of improbable 'near-superhuman toughness and feats'.  One exception that's easily noted is the wound one of the characters receives early on, that certainly wasn't fatal, but that after the initial incident and subsequent treatment, doesn't seem to affect the character as much as it should.  You could still have her/him (I don't want to indicate which character it was) running about and such, but give a really pronounced limp to it when they're running along.  It's not a terrible mistake, but since I'm  praising the movie for being so believable, I thought I'd also mention the part where I thought it lacked a bit on that front.  Back on the positive side, the movie holds up with its thrills and effectiveness right through to the end, whereas some movies like this crumble quite a bit at the climax.

  With a talented cast, (including Michelle Rodriguez from ""Resident Evil"", ""BloodRayne"" and ""Lost""), a nice island setting, extremely effective action sequences and well-done special effects, ""The Breed"" is a credit to the 'lethal animals' subgenre of horror.

Over all a very enjoyable movie, looking forward to a sequel.",1184716800,7,477,4.72289156626506

2598980,1,B000G1ALDY,"Barf!

I watched this film, expecting something interesting. It starts off as if it is an updated version of the interesting but hokey film THE KILLER SHREWS.

Expectations by the cast are raised. Some of the relationships seem good enough. Some of the interplay works, but ultimently, it sinks.

Why? Because no one gets out alive. In KILLER SHREWS the people keep their wits about them, use what is at hand to escape and get off the island. Here, they all die.

If you want to see a better update of THE KILLER SHREWS, watch TREMORS. It's the same idea, same use of ""things at hand"" and use of the mind.

Avoid this shaggy dog. You can see that it is being remaindered for nickles.",1183248000,2,683,4.432
2598981,2,B000G1ALDY,"First of all, this wasn't a very good movie.  It was pretty predictable and pretty much standard fare as members of the cast get picked off one by one by the creature(s) of the film.  Some die heroically as they sacrifice themselves for the rest of their group and some die just from being stupid in a horror movie.  The young people (I guess they are college students) are some of the brightest people I have have ever seen.  They are master electricians, mechanics and engineers.  A whole group of McGivers who can fix or alter any gadget available to do whatever is necessary at the time.  A very resourceful group.  Anyway these 5 land on this island where earlier 2 other people met their fates and they find that roaming the island is a union of dogs who are above average in intelligence and organization and who are also determined to wipe out any humans unfortunate to visit the island.  What this film comes down to is kind of a battle of wits between college students and dogs.  While hokey, this film was at least watchable.  There was one scene however that borders on unforgetable.  A wild dog is attacking one of the girls and one of our hero guys thinks he's Robin Hood, so he takes a bow and arrow to shoot the dog off the girl's leg.  This is filmed in slow motion, so that dog, girl and shooter can all take the time to watch the flight of the arrow, to the point where our shooter actually lowers the bow after he shoots so he can watch the shot.  The girl is then forever thankful that they never tried the apple on the head shot out of William Tell.  After this disasterous shot, the same guy then proceeds to quick aim and nail a dog leaping through the air.  Talk about improving your aim!!!  Anyway, I give this movie 2 stars.  I'm neutral on the acting.  Nothing great, but the actors really don't embarrass themselves either.  It's not a very good movie, but at least it can keep your attention for about an hour and a half.",1183075200,2,1951,4.354570637119114
2598982,4,B000G1ALDY,"Imagine CUJO then multiply it by ten, and you get WES CRAVEN'S THE BREED. It's kind of like a slasher movie, only with dogs. Characters wander off alone, and then are attacked. There's no phone, and the movie takes place at a cabin in the middle of nowhere so there's no chance of anyone coming to the rescue.
THE BREED is a fun little action/horror movie with plenty of jump-out-of-your-seat moments. It starts off kind of slow, taking good bit of time for character development. In most movies like this, that's a bad thing. However, I liked the characters in this movie.
I'd recommend THE BREED to anyone who likes killer dog movies.",1182729600,4,636,4.6371681415929205
2598983,2,B000G1ALDY,"Really kind of disappointed with Craven's work in the last several years, and this movie is just more proof of that feeling.  With ""The Breed"" he does bring out some scary options for the typical characters he has.  In this movie they are of course just a bunch of college students on some vacation getaway on an island that formerly housed some secret government test facility that experimented with dogs.

It has the usual problem presented which has the youths trying to figure out a plan of escape as well as at times, a plan of attack.  In the end I just felt like this movie was sub standard slash that did not have enough staying power to make me feel like it had any value to be viewed again.  Craven needs to concentrate on getting more intricate scripts that are followed up by some better actors, but that costs more money so I am not expecting anything spectacular from him anytime soon.",1182470400,2,899,4.49079754601227
2598984,4,B000G1ALDY,"One of the first ""scare"" movies I saw in the 70's as a kid, was a movie called ""The Pack"".  It was basically a pack of dogs acting in the same vein as the shark in ""Jaws"".  Now comes the idea redone as ""The Breed"".  Honestly, I didn't expect much from this movie.  But it is really well done.  A lot of horror movies in the 70's were not necessarily by the numbers, genre pictures.  They were dramatic movies with a few horrific elements thrown in.  In those type of movies, you actually got to know the characters and saw them interact in a realistic way before something both scary and plausible happened to them.  That is exactly what this movie is and it is a reliable good time for any late night cable viewing or to own.  Apparently, after reading the other reviews here, the audience of today has come to expect a formula that ""The Breed"" does not fit into.  I love sex and violence just as much as the next guy, but when was the last time you saw believable characters in a low budget horror?  For me, probably it was ""Dead Mary"".  So this doesn't feature a Jason like hacker, or blood and guts, so what?  This was well thought out, acted, written, and directed.  What has happened to audiences that they can't stand a decent story without scare, pause, scare, pause, scare...",1182384000,8,1284,4.362869198312236
2598985,2,B000G1ALDY,"If you are worried that because this movies is called ""Wes Craven Presents 'The Breed'"" rather than simply ""The Breed"" that is a clear sign that this is not a good movie, then you are right.  To be fair, first-time director Nicholas Mastandrea has been the first assistant director on all three of Craven's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream-Trilogy/dp/B00004W20F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream Trilogy</a>, so you can understand Craven wanting to give his blessing to this project and what problems there are with ""The Breed"" (not to be confused with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breed/dp/B00005QAPB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breed</a>,"" a 2001 film set in a distant future where vampires try to live among regular folk as a special and peaceful breed) really has little to do with Mastandrea's work as a director.  When you put the DVD in the menu comes up and you see a young woman being menaced by what looks like a wolf, only this movie is about dogs and not wolves and none of the dogs look like the illustrated wolf.  So as I watched this movie, time and time again as different elements were worked into the film I kept thinking of other (better) films with the same elements (you want to see a wolf go after a pretty girl, check out ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood-of-the-Wolf/dp/B00006ADEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a>""), and I knew that would be the motif of this review.

""The Breed"" begins with a couple showing up at this deserted island in their sailboat.  Jenny (Lisa-Maire Schneider) goes exploring and quickly meets her fate while Luke (Nick Boraine) calls her name and gets no answer (a better ""getting off the sailboat is a big mistake"" movie would be  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water-2-Adrift/dp/B000OOUPKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water 2: Adrift</a>"").  Jump ahead to five twenty-somethings flying in a small plane to the same deserted island (well, if it was a different deserted island it would not make sense).  There are two brothers, John (Oliver Hudson, ""Black Christmas"") the black sheep and Matt (Eric Lively, ""The Butterfly Effect 2"") the good guy (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bible-In-the-Beginning/dp/B00005NKT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bible ... In the Beginning</a>"" has the original bickering brothers, Cain and Abel).  Matt is interested in Sara (Taryn Manning, ""Crossroads""), while Matt is with Nicki (Michelle Rodriguez, ""Resident Eveil"").  Tagging along is fifth wheel Noah (Hill Harper, ""He Got Game""), who is so obviously going to be the first person to die you have to wonder if this is a nudge-nudge wink-wink to ""Scream.""  Anyhow, basically the people meet the dogs and then what passes for terror in this movie takes place.  The point where I was convinced the movie was going in the wrong direction was when Sara gets bit and not because the group fails to take the opportunity to get out while the getting out is good, but because once Sara starts to get affected by the bite she gets....sort of horny. (down, boys, there is no nudity in this film, only gratuitous cleavage).  The plot also involves using a bow-and-arrow (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood/dp/B00005JKEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a>""), trying to get a car to start(""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cujo/dp/B00005O438/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cujo</a>""), and finding the lab where this all began (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-World-Jurassic-Park/dp/B00004U8JV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost World - Jurassic Park</a>"").

Now, you have to understand that when I was very little I was jumped on by a German shepherd and for the next twenty years or so of my life I was terrified of dogs (I see a dog and the dog would immediately smell fear).  So the thought of a pack of dogs coming after people should make me squirming.  When I was in high school there was a movie called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doberman-Gang/dp/B0009YV3ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doberman Gang</a>,"" which was only about a gang using Dobermans to rob a bank, but damned if I was going to go see a movie with vicious dogs.  But as I watched ""The Breed"" what I was reminded of was not my irrational childhood fears but rather of one of my favorite bad B&W B-Movie, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Shrews/dp/B00006II54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Shrews</a>,"" which had dogs wear rugs to play the giant killer shrews.  The plots of these two movies are quite similar: people come to island with vicious beasts created by mad scientists.  But ""The Killer Shrews"" has the virtue of Miss Universe 1957, Festus from ""Gunsmoke,"" and a bunch of dogs running around with carpets on them, so it is much more enjoyable than ""The Breed.""  So rent that instead of this one and avoid rolling your eyes or having to ugly laughter for 78 minutes.

To be fair, it is not that these people are too stupid to live (""House of Wax""), but that the dogs have been genetically engineered so that they really are smarter than the humans on this island.  If for some reason all of these reviews do nothing to dissuade you and you rent this movie, I think you will be surprised at the body count (I am not saying this is a good thing or a bad thing), but if you are a fan of horror films then you will see the final shot coming from a gazillion miles away, a scene that earns a final laugh of derision.  But I did give this movie two stars for several good reasons.  First, it is not a snuff film, which would be a movie that earns a single star and singles that those responsible should be hunted down and disposed of in a similar manner.  Second, there is something to be said for a movie like this that wants to make do with 29 dogs (and 10 handlers) rather than CGI.  Third, there was a single scene I liked in the movie and got a legitimate laugh, when the two brothers are out for a drive.  The tone really does not fit the rest of the movie, but as you might suspect that is not a bad thing, which the rest of this movie most decidedly happens to be.",1182384000,4,6512,5.578093306288032
2598986,1,B000G1ALDY,"I would like to see a thoughtful horror movie, and i know such a thing is possible despite evidence to the contrary.. Breed is a movie that challenges its audience about as much american idol improves popular music (it does not improve music just in case you were wondering).. Breed is a recycled story line that has been used in countless horror movies and even in such popular movies as jurassic park.. Something in the wild has gone nuts due to science and now the characters must endure the challenges.. This approach can work, provided that the characters are interesting.. For me, the most interesting part of the movie was when one character shot the other in the leg with an arrow - that was about as good as it got.. To be honest i was glad to see these stupid partying college kids bight the dust.. If you like stupid horror films - this one will be right up your alley..

2598987,1,B000G1ALDY,"The Breed is just plain awful! There is not a single scary or creepy scene in the entire film, but there are annoyances aplenty.  In this sense one is reminded of teen slasher films of the 80s in which you wanted every last one of the characters to get killed off because you couldn't stand any of them.  That's pretty much what we have here. I didn't cringe but cheered as each character met their demise.  Sadly three survived, but there is hope that perhaps they didn't as you'll see in the ending.

  Here is a summary of annoyances that stuck out the most:

-as mentioned, the dogs are not the least bit menacing.  I saw much more tail wagging then teeth gnarling.  The back of the dvd cover also implies that there were perhaps hundreds of dogs.  Not!  I don't think I ever saw more than a pack of 5 at most at one time.

-Michelle Rodriguez takes an arrow through the leg by our less than accurate archery man early in the film in a particularly ludicrous sequence.  We are then cut to a scene where the gang is to remove the arrow.  But Rodriguez is much too calm and cool as she is cracking jokes and saying matter of factly, ""I guess this is going to hurt"" right before the arrow is to be pulled out.

-the bow and arrow guy climbs up on a radio tower later in the film.  While up there he falls at least 20 or 30 feet and lands on his back.  This fall not only doesn't kill him, it doesn't even faze him as he jumps right up and runs away unscathed.

-the last remaining girl (I won't spoil it) opens a gas line and uses a lighter to basically blow the building she and several of the dogs are in to kingdom come.  She has sacrifed herself to kill a handful of these dogs for the benefit of the remaining 2 survivors we think as the scene cuts to a shot of the outside of the building she was in that is now engulfed in flames.  Inexplicably, however, she shows up in the next scene driving the car.  She is completed unscathed and untouched.  Not so much as a scratch on her.  Not only that, but her demeanor is not the least bit affected by the supposed trauma she has just endured.  She just cooly tells the guys to hop in as if they were all out on the town on a Saturday night and headed to the soda shop.

-lastly, the car flying off the dock was the ultimate jump the shark moment for me even if everything else is overlooked.  At that point, as we watch the car going into the water, I started laughing so hard I almost came to tears - certainly not the intention of the director.  It was just so ridiculous and over the top, and such a lame attempt at a climatic ending that failed so utterly bad.

To to summarize: at no point was I scared; at no point did I care about these people; at several points I was annoyed; and during one final climatic scene I laughed uncontrollably.",1180656000,3,2799,4.152416356877324

8128656,4,B000G1ALDY,"RELEASED IN 2006 and directed by Nicholas Mastandrea, The Breed details events when five American youths spend a party weekend at a scenic isolated island. Unfortunately, the island is inhabited by scores of mad dogs, literally.  Oliver Hudson and Eric Lively head the cast as rival brothers: one a wild screw-up and the other proper & academic.

The cabin-in-the-woods horror element is old hat, dating back to Night of the Living Dead (1968), but The Breed is more realistic than most of these kinds of creature features, particularly since the creature in this case is a bunch of rabid canines, which brings to mind movies like Wolfen (1981) and Night of the Wild (2015). The Breed is more akin to the latter, but with a limited cast and isolated setting.

The prologue is highlighted by Lisa-Marie Schneider in a bikini and the gorgeous South African locations (although Im sure the island is supposed to be somewhere off the American Northwest coast). Michelle Rodriguez & Taryn Manning appear as the two main females in the cast; they're likable enough and moderately appealing, but nothing to get overly excited over. Its nice to see Michelle in a role that deviates from her typical kick-axx clich.

Despite the by-the-numbers plot and some horror trappings, e.g. the black dude (Hill Harper) dying first (which isn't a spoiler), it all comes down to whether or not you can buy the setting & the characters; and does the movie build-up suspense by the final act? The answer to both questions is yes. It may not be a resounding yes, but its a good enough yes.

I heard a couple of critics pan the film on the grounds that the youths look way older than teens or even college age, but listen closely and its established that they're all in their mid-20s. For instance, the younger brother is 25, which means that the older brother is around 27; and the blonde girl is 24 if you do the math.

THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in George and Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. WRITERS: Robert Conte & Peter Wortmann.

8128659,3,B000G1ALDY,"It is kind of like ""The Birds"" but with dogs.  A relatively simple plot, a group of people go to a cabin on an island for a weekend of partying, and end up being attacked by a pack of dogs.  The story is then, of course about how to get off the island.  The most notable star is Michelle Rodriguez, joined by Oliver Hudson, Hill Harper, Eric Lively and Taryn Manning.  It is pretty much what you would expect from a B-level, low-budget horror movie.  The acting and writing are okay, but nothing special.  It is pretty formulaic for what these types of movies tend to be,  There are quite a few good ""make you jump"" moments, even when you can anticipate them.

For extras there are just some previews and a 25 min or so behind the scenes feature focused mainly on training the dogs and the actors working with the dogs.  Perfectly fine for the overall length of the movie.  As I said you pretty much know what you get with a movie like this.  Given that it was produced by Wes Craven (likely one of his last projects) and directed by his assistant on the Scream movies, it has some horror genre credibility behind it.  It is not a masterpiece, but it is good if you are in the mood for a horror/suspense movie.",1498435200,2,1210,4.28193832599119
