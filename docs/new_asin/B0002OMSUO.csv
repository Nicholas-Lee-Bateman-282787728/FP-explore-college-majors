8029898,3,B0002OMSUO,"I remember renting this movie from a local video vision when I was a kid.  My cousin and I watched it, and I will be the first to admit....It isn't much of a Horror movie, but you still leave the movie with a strange feeling.  You get mostly laughs through the whole movie, because looking back on 70's horror is just plain funny.  I would watch it again",1287532800,,354,4.176470588235294
8029899,1,B0002OMSUO,"While at a local thrift store my friend found this wonderful peice of trash cinema in the $0.99 video bin and noticing the strange cover art and title he picked it up showing it to me thinking we should watch it becuase it would be aweful. We usually find odd, obscure, cult like films for our viewing pleasure (or displeasure). This one we sorta looked at each other with blank stares and scattered laughter as the psuedo-psycho drama film with Baltimore accents and drugged out chicks with 70's boobs bursting from the screen on this ""recorded in ep mode videocassette"" plays out before our bewildered eyes.

In the fashion of early cheap 70's films with long weird sounding titles like ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"".

It's worth owning only for the sheer fact that it's only ever been released on video ONCE in 1985 and is not available on DVD as of yet.
This is SO obscure and SO out of the norm it was like watching Glen Or Glenda John Water's style and only if it's $1 or less.

Lots of laughs but the movie has a depressing ending.
IMDB it.

Looks like something for Quentin Tarentino to remake.",1245628800,2,1115,4.532338308457711
