8230250,5,B000XJD3E8,"This series has done a wonderful job with selling itself to me. The character designs are beautiful, the story is gripping and there is more than enough intrigue to keep me interested in knowing more. I have raved about this series to people I know and as long as the story keeps going at such a strong pace I don't see any reason why I'm going to stop. Very recommended.",1213920000,,371,4.314285714285714
8230251,4,B000XJD3E8,"After v. 1 set up the general idea of what a ""Hell Girl"" is, v. 2 begins to flesh out the characters more and seems to begin a storyline that goes beyond compartmentalized episodes.

Theres also one episode thats really different and i won't spoil it.

As with v. 1 HG is really animated art, and the enclosed art cards are again really nice. While Ive not done it yet, I intended to look up the Memorial listed in the credits to check out more Japanese art of the period.",1199232000,2,472,4.233333333333333
8230252,5,B000XJD3E8,"I really wasn't sure how vol. 2 would play out.  I mean vol. 1 was worth every penny the artwork is beautiful and every story is different and interesting, but come on......How can these episodes continue?  Someone is always wronged and vengeance is a dish best served cold. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boy, was I completely wrong!  I will have to agree with the first review on this volume. You are taken just alittle deeper into the character of Hell Girl.  Curious, she doesn't seem like such souless creature, maybe once human...hmmmmm.  I really can't wait for vol. 3, 4, 5, etc, you get the idea.",1198713600,,593,4.6
8230253,5,B000XJD3E8,"After enjoying volume 1. Volume 2 seems to take a small turn. This time we get a little more story behind Hell Girl, it seems Hell Girl is a little more sinister in this particular volume. She seems to play a bigger role in finding the truth of some of the so called victims, but the biggest twist in this volume comes in the form of a photographer and his daughter who seem to have taken notice of Hell Girls exploits. The daughter however has a special bond or relationship with Hell Girl that will hopefully play out more in the next volume. This volume was excellent, I hope to see more of the story behind Hell Girl. Truly recommended.",1198368000,3,640,4.341666666666667
