7657928,1,B01BKM0ZRE,"As a Chinese descent, I don't understand why the movie has to racialize the evil to be chinese? And with Greene which is a Jewish name? What kind of message the screenwriter wants to send to children? When they see Chinese characters and the taichi pattern they will probably subconsciously relate to evil in the future. The screenwriter might be a discreet racist who really hates Chinese people. I won't let my children to watch this film.",1518912000,,441,4.740259740259741

7657931,2,B01BKM0ZRE,"A great message and an all star cast cant save this film from mediocrity. Most of the laughs come from pee and fart jokes, and those that dont, won't entertain anyone whos graduated middle school. Norm couldn't keep my three-year-olds attention and made me want to gauge my own eyes out. Spare yourself; watch Happy Feet instead.",1516579200,,329,4.7894736842105265

7657940,5,B01BKM0ZRE,"Theres a new 3D animated character in town, and his name is norm. While at the surface Norm of the North may seem like your typical children's movie, but not only is it a romp it also has a second layer of heart for the adult audience. I watched this movie at 7 at night on a Tuesday after work.  I poured myself a tall glass of Coca-Cola, Popped a big bag of the old corn, and stuck this sucker into the blu ray player. little did I know I was about to witness the journey of a lifetime. This film deals with big themes like being somewhere you don't belong and making new friends. Even though the film is chocked full of slapstick goofy humor, there is also a heart to the film that just seeps through. I give this movie a 10/10 because Norm rocks out while teaching us important lessons.",1509148800,,790,4.163398692810458

7657944,1,B01BKM0ZRE,"1 star is probably the lowest rating anyone can possibly give it because giving it a zero and removing it to the dark abyss where this idea came from would do it justice, Rob Schneider needs to stick to movies as Adam Sandler's secondary cast member for the rest of his despicable life.",1505520000,,286,4.415094339622642

7657954,1,B01BKM0ZRE,"Started out as potentially acceptably funny and cute, despite 2nd-rate animation (we can put up with that). Devolved into nonsensical jokes and hyperactivity. Character animation was just a little too surreal -- distracting. Some of the adult characters are hyper-uglified, and the main bad guy, who is a new-agey hippie type who became rich through commercial real estate development, is all rubbery and kind of snakes his limbs around.  We are pretty easy to please, but the 3 1/2-year-old was not super-interested and didn't complain when the adults finally turned it off after an hour.  It got too weird to be fun, like it was a bunch of test cases for animation and film students to do, thrown together in a haphazard story.",1502150400,,729,4.91869918699187

Now there were some likeable characters, and some rather funny moments, but mostly it was preachy, with very little plot or even thought, going into the writing and character development.

7657960,5,B01BKM0ZRE,"This was a great family movie. I have a 7 year old son and a 2 year old daughter and they were both entertained. My daughter loved the music in it and my son got a kick out of the silly parts (lemmings peeing etc...). So that is a rave in my family. I liked it a lot better than The Secret Life of Pets, which had a dark side for a kids movie. Some movies lag and do not hold either of their interests but Norm kept them watching the entire movie. If you want something sweet to watch, that has a good moral to it, than this is a sure bet.",1500422400,2,539,3.7787610619469025

about how they could cash in on Madagascar & Minions popularity. Plot
is very thin and too much doesn't make sense. I like Rob Schneider and
Heather Graham but wonder if it is actually the Rob Schneider from SNL.
He is funny, his character was not at all. I really wanted to like
this but it was pretty lame. I think people rating it so high either
have a stake in the movie or a relative. Best part of the movie was the

7658017,3,B01BKM0ZRE,"Norm of the North comes to us from Splash Entertainment riding atop the Lionsgate Films distribution train; yes the same individuals responsible for what has become of the once-bright Alpha & Omega franchise.

Going in with this handicap alone should have clued me in to the type of entertainment experience to expect.  However, I still continued on, blank slate into the project as it were.  One thing thats immediately clear from the onset here is that the additional budget (over the above mentioned TV series) definitely allowed for the integration of better visuals, smoother animations and much richer textures.  Unfortunately, thats about where the compliments end.

Norm of the North is a 2016 American computer-animated comedy-adventure film directed by Trevor Wall and written by Daniel R. Altiere, Steven M. Altiere, and Malcolm T. Goldman.  And, despite being massacred by critics, somehow managed to turn a pretty healthy profit margin at the box-office; having been created on a budget of $18-million and turning that into $27.4-mil by the end of its theatrical run.

The story here tells of Norm, the Polar Bear (Rob Schneider); the son of the King Of The Arctic. In his youth, he develops the ability to speak to humans, a trait shared by his Grandfather (Colm Meaney). Because of this, he is outcast from the other animals, aside from a bird Socrates (Bill Nighy) and Elizabeth (Kate Higgins), a female polar bear/ Norms barely-used love interest.

Things operate about as normal as can be expected for a talking/ dancing polar bear in the wild until a condo-manufacturing outfit drops off the first of its new arctic homes with intentions of filming a commercial there.

Dancing Norm, obviously, isn't going to take this sitting down and, with the assistance of some very Minion-esque lemmings, hatches a plot to scare away the crew of the project.  From here its a muddled hour and 20-minutes more of Norm running around Manhattan, convincing the world at large that he is merely an actor in a bear suit on account of his ability to speak English.

His target is the mogul behind the condo operation, a bizarrely developed pony-tail sporting weirdo curiously named Mr. Greene (no environmentalist agendas here or anything).  Hes voiced by Ken Jeong in one of the only vocal performances Im aware of that sees Ken get to play a male.

Now heres where things go from odd to worse; we discover that money-obsessed Mr. Greene, corporate man to the end, has apparently captured Norms English-speaking grandfather and is holding him captive.  Gee, don't you think that maybe this guy, who is presented as trying to make a profit on everything under the sun, may have thought to charge admission to see the worlds only talking bear?  Or sold him off to science at the very least?  Nah, throw the talking bear in the cage and lets focus on putting up condos in one of the more inhospitable places on the planet.

And that, in summation, is the experience of watching Norm of the North in a nutshell.  Now these are animated movies for children and I respect that but its been my experience that children are some of the toughest critics of them all.  And the worst part is that the team behind this one was blatantly aware of that fact as well and made certain to load up the film with all sorts of terrible gimmicks designed to elicit a cheap laugh: Dancing polar bears, lemmings urinating all over the place, flatulence jokes aplenty.

Surprisingly, this is one of the rare animated films to feature the generally comedic Rob Schneider in the lead that doesnt come off as a complete and utter train-wreck.  A lot of this stems from the very clear fact that this was a film written and animated for its English-speaking cast.  This makes all the difference in the world when attempting to get a believable performance out of an actor without the limitations of having to time their dialog to the mouth flaps of a foreign film.  Watch Schneiders performance in the abysmal Legend of the Sea for further proof of this phenomenon.

All told, there were a few moments where I really began to question the harsh assessments of this production.  It literally has all of the pieces of the puzzle for success: A decent cast, solid visuals, human character models that appear to have been lifted from Despicable Me, for that matter even a gimmicky little troop of fur balls that they were clearly hoping would become the worlds next Minions.  At the end of the day though, the finished product feels convoluted, nonsensical and tries way too hard to take it and its agendas seriously.

I suppose the lesson here is that if you're intention is to try and rip off and combine Despicable Me with Happy Feet, go all the way with their vastly superior sense of silliness where applicable as well.",1487289600,,4794,4.793438639125152

7658152,2,B01BKM0ZRE,Huh? What!? This movie isn't for kids. It doesn't even seem like the plot is real. What is happening???,1486166400,,103,4.473684210526316

7658155,3,B01BKM0ZRE,"The animation is good, but the storyline is a little farfetched. I know it's a kids movie, but it was hard to get into. Wasn't one of my sons favorites either. Still, a decent movie for a freebie on Amazon.",1486166400,7,206,4.175
7658156,1,B01BKM0ZRE,This a kid's film that essentially revolves around property development applications. My 4 year old was really absolutely riveted.,1486166400,,130,5.894736842105263
7658157,1,B01BKM0ZRE,"Is this movie as bad as you've probably heard? Yes, yes it is.

One of the voice actors; Gabriel Iglesias; once commented that he read a script for this film and fell in love it. I find myself asking: ""What Script?""  The character played by the talented comedian barely has more than 4 lines across the entire film; which raises the question over how close the final film was to the pitch.

Was this a film about a dancing polar bear making his way to a show on Broadway; like an arctic themed ""Cat's Don't Dance"" film? Was this a film about an outcast Polar Bear proving himself worthy to be the King of the Polar Bears; an arctic themed take on the ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" film? Was this a wacky-environmentalist movie aimed at kids like the ""Ferngully"" film that traumatized kids so many years ago? Was this a quasi-positive pro-family-means-anything film like the recent ""Storks"" film?

It's almost like the director decided to lift plot points and ideas from a variety of films ostensibly aimed at kids; which probably could have worked if ""Norm of the North"" had just settled on one concept or another. Instead the viewer is delivered an almost never-ending parade of new characters as plot points are abandoned and resurrected almost at a whim. Most movies that feature animals tend to either focus on the strengths and limitations of the animals; or exaggerate those strengths and weaknesses. E.g. the wonderful sequence from ""Over the Hedge"" and the caffeinated squirrel who moves faster than light. So one would think that an over-exaggerated Polar Bear would be able to hold their breath for ludicrous amounts of time underwater; over and above the massive amount of time real-life Polar Bears can stay submerged. Instead; the film plays it the other way; giving the Polar Bear a drowning sequence... which... is mind numbing.

The issues with the story are compounded by the film's ostensible villain; a character the director said he tried to pattern after Donald Trump. Patterning a movie villain after a real-person can work; but only if the real-life person is a villain. Donald Trump isn't; and result is almost utter nonsense as the director fails to realize that he's trying to make a villain by mocking somebody who is grade triple AAA Hero Material. It just doesn't work.

In short: this is a movie that is as bad as you've probably heard. It spends way too much time on biological and scatological humor; and the few creative action scenes that were likely used in the pitch to get this film made are lost in a sea of nonsense and terrible writing.

That being said; if you have a Prime Subscription and enjoy bad movies; grab some Tuaca, Vodka, or Tequila; and try to make a drinking game out of every fart joke; peeing joke; utter inane line of dialog; and new character that only gets a few lines. Don't blame me though if your live cries for mercy after 5 minutes run-time.",1486166400,,2905,4.717948717948718

Even waiting in the lobby with nothing to do would have been preferable to sitting inside. If we weren't there to be with friends, I would have just collected my children and left.

No disrespect considering this wasn't intended for a wide theatrical release, but this movie probably should have gone to where it was meant to be. The plot is dumb, the animation is beyond lazy and the humor is easily going for little kids.

7658804,1,B01BKM0ZRE,"Horrible animation better suited for a mid-2000''s straight to DVD movie.

A plot that is both the mundane and generic ""a talking animal must save an area from human developers"", yet at the same time somewhat baffling as it expects the viewer to believe that people would want to live in condos in the arctic. Also filled with needless padding.

The lemmings are horribly annoying with their farting noises and feel like a cheap attempt to rip off the Minions from Despicable Me.

The characters are not characters in the sense that they have depth or you can relate to them on anything but the most superficial layer. They are stereotypes meant to serve a single purpose in the movie and that's it.",1472342400,,699,4.666666666666667

7658944,3,B01BKM0ZRE,"Norm of the North just misses something to put it in the same qulality category as most other animated movies with big name actor voices, it's hard to say what is, but that's the feeling you get as you watch it. The polar bear isn't badly drawn (well it's computer animation), or anything, nor the human characters, but it just doesn't look as good overall as Pixar films or what we've become accustomed to in a post Toy Story, Shrek existence world. There's a bit of crude humour in this which might not sit well with overly protective parents but on the other hand the story is dumbed down to appeal to a young audience, such as the polar bear (well Norm) is a bad hunter and can't bring himself to eat a seal that falls into his lap, yet he isn't starving and is in fact quite overweight. The plot is a simple one, Norm who is only one of two polar bears who can speak human (the other being his grandad who has disappeared), is a bit of a social outcast, but being egged on by a female bear he likes, goes to New York with a prototype house being returned on a ship to convince the humans not to build houses in the arctic. Norm also dances at various times in the movie. The plot doesn't have much substance to appeal to adult or older kids. The lemmings seem like a blatant rip off of minions and because the bear dances all the time you can't help but compare it to Happy Feet set at the opposite pole, that had the same environmental plot objective. The human characters of a single mother and her smarter than her daughter (the dad is never mentioned), are exactly the same as ones you've seen in countless other films.

But sometimes the same old formula and plot are what you want and if so this isn't that bad. But this isn't a movie that you'll remember in years to come.",1464566400,,1784,4.262536873156342

7658985,3,B01BKM0ZRE,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Dont look at the box art for this film and think its going to be a heavy handed movie dealing with climate change or a light hearted romp through New York. Sure it will take on the topic in a subtle manner but it does so in such a way as to not offend one side of the topic and make the point for the other. The end result is a fun movie for kids that will make them realize we have to treat this planet with respect while at the same time not insult people who feel there is no cause for panic yet.

Norm is a polar bear with a problem. The son of the polar bear king at the North Pole he cant seem to act like the rest of the bears. First off he cant catch anything he hunts for and secondly he can talk. Not just bear talk but talk so that humans can understand him, a trait only his missing grandfather shared. This comes in handy as the north is fast becoming a tourist attraction with humans flocking to see the animals in their natural habitat. I say natural because animals like Norms brother realize they can get things from humans like food if they act the way the humans expect them to.

Things take a turn for the worse when a land developer decides to start building vacation homes at the north. A future with tons of people everywhere and a land covered in these homes would be devastating to the wildlife there and take away their ability to live their lives as they're supposed to. Norm realizes this and sets out to stop it. To do so he stows away on one of the model houses after a commercial shoot there uses footage of him.

The house, and Norm, arrive in New York City and he tracks down the main office of the company intent on building the homes. The company is run by Mr. Greene, a devious manipulator with dreams of vast fortunes at any costs. Working for him is Vera, a woman who longs to have her bright child Olympia attend a prestigious school. Mr. Greene, a graduate of the school, has promised to help her in this cause once the homes have been built. Norm arrives at their offices just as they are auditioning actors to pose as the polar bear that Vera filmed on location, namely Norm.

Norm does get the job and everyone thinks hes really an actor in a polar bear suit. He becomes a star around the office and rather than get the chance to make his case for not building the homes the footage is manipulated to make it appear just the opposite. With the help of Olympia, who knows the truth and doesnt want to see the north ruined, Norms sets out to stop Mr. Greene.

So is the movie any good? Yes it is. It entertains on a number of levels and gets the message across that we don't need to spread ourselves everywhere on the planet at the costs of the animals living there. Not only that, it does so in a non-offensive manner as well. While the voice talents include Rob Schneider, Heather Graham, Ken Jeong and Gabriel Iglesias, and all do well, I often have a hard time trying to credit the actors when the film is animated. That being said they do a pretty good job here.

The only negative I can offer here is in the animation and honestly its not a terrible thing. Being exposed to so many great animated sequences and films from Pixar, the premier studio in the field, you find yourself comparing any other feature made to that gold standard. NORM does a good job but is just slightly off in ways that are hard to describe. That being said it really wasn't distracting and kids won't notice. Its nice to see another studio making the attempt.

The best thing to be found in the film is the comic relief and thats supplied by the lemmings. The furry little rodents steal the show from Norm much like the Minions stole the thunder from Gru in the DESPICABLE ME movies. Depicted here as indestructible they offer the most hilarious moments as Norms companions at home and on his adventure. And just like the Minions they never talk but just rattle on.

On the whole this movie is a fun outing that the whole family can enjoy. It also opens the door to talk to kids about protecting the environment without being preachy or taking aim at anyone who feels the ways to do so are up for discussion. Rather than say the science is closed it says lets talk about this and see what kind of solution we can come up with. For me at least this seems like a responsible way to let kids know and hopefully will help them grow up to find solutions rather than focus on who to blame.",1462752000,3,4462,4.2461719670200235

Norm is a polar bear who was born with the ability to speak English, and by English I mean American English and not that stuff with foreign accents. When the ironically named Mr. Greene decides to build modern homes in the Arctic, Norm travels to NYC in an attempt to save his home and later that Grandpa thing. He meets the very do-able Vera, drawn almost anime style as they attempt to rescue everybody in this formula film.

There are multiple themes about saving the Arctic and wildlife, but no mention of that global warming thing, a controversial subject that only 99% of the planet can agree upon. There is an us (99%) vs them (1 %) theme in a Mr. Greene statement yet his investors turn out to be good guys. Mr Greene has a name which warns us that not everything labeled ""green"" is actually ""green"" and not all NY real estate moguls live up to their name. I am not sure why the NYC council has legal jurisdiction over the Arctic, but plot continuity is not a sell point.

The cutesy film is also a musical and should have an appeal to the 5-8 year old group with fart humor and ""Shut Up and Dance With Me"" number.",1462060800,,1180,4.306306306306307

The directors, voice actors and writer (there can only be one, and he/she can't be over the age of 9) should all be tried for crimes against humanity.  Abysmal...",1461283200,33,461,4.252873563218391
7659015,2,B01BKM0ZRE,"The sole purpose of this film is to serve as a platform for environmental eco-propaganda. While I will be the first to readily admit that humans tend to destroy everything that they touch, cartoons aimed at children should entertain, not indoctrinate.

The entire plot of this movie centers on one man's desire to build over-priced, cookie-cutter condos in the pristine Arctic and one talking bear's race to save Mother Nature from human beings. His adventure takes him far from his home in the Arctic all the way to New York City and back.

The only redeeming aspect of this cartoon, and the only reason that it is getting two stars instead of the one star that it truly deserves, is the bear's constant companions - three small lemmings - which are totally adorable. There are a few funny ""giggle"" moments, but nothing really ""laugh out loud.""

My kids did love the main characters in the movie and the relationship between Norm and the humans was interesting too. The animation was ok, and while the plot seemed a bit predictable, the movie still was enjoyable, especially for young viewers.
