2206231,5,B0007989KC,"I recently purchased the entire trilogy of films known as the 'Class of Nuke' Em High,' on DVD.
They're all from Troma Films, an independent production company based out of New Jersey.
Here is a review of each movie, in chronological order, they might contain spoilers, FYI.

Class of Nuke 'Em High

Unleashed in 1986, the original Class of Nuke 'Em High is, for me at least, the weakest in the trilogy. The plot revolves around Tromaville High School, which is known as 'Nuke 'Em High,' due to the fact that it's within spitting distance of a high-profile Nuclear Power Plant. Somewhere along the line, a meltdown occurs and infects the water supply of the local school. The regular students slowly become vicious, violent cretins, part of the Cretin Biker Gang, who wreak havoc on the school and around Tromaville. Warren and Christie, two young lovers are the main characters, who start to suspect something fishy after smoking a radioactive joint that causes them to hallucinate. The rest is the students versus the cretins versus the nuclear power plant versus the townspeople. If you like low-grade Z-movies, this is will tickle your fancy.

Class of Nuke 'Em High 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown

Released five years after the original, Subhumanoid Meltdown follows the story of Roger Smith, who goes to Tromaville University, which is slowly being overtaken by cretins and a race of mutants known as 'subhumanoids,' who are being manufactured by the people working in the (you guessed it) nearby nuclear power plant. I wasn't really paying attention when I watched this one, I'd been having a rough day and was falling asleep, so it's hard for me to review that which I don't understand very well. As far as I can tell, it focuses around Roger, played by Brick Bronsky, who gets tangled up in a government program to cross-breed humans and subhumanoids. He falls in love with a subhumanoid and then tragedy strikes when a rogue squirrel finds some tasty-looking radioactive material, gets infected by it and becomes Tromie, the eighty-foot radioactive squirrel from Hell! Tromie wreaks havoc on students and cretins alike, and the movie ends rather abruptly. Personally, I liked this one better than the first.

Class of Nuke 'Em High 3: The Good The Bad And The Subhumanoid

The final (?) chapter in the trilogy of Class of Nuke 'Em High movies, The Good The Bad And The Subhumanoid is easily the best in the trilogy. It follows Adlai Smith, third-generation subhumanoid son of Roger Smith and the subhumanoid he fell in love with in the second movie. Adlai is played by Brick Bronsky, who also plays Adlai's evil twin, Dick, and his own father, Roger, from part two, who is now the mayor of Tromaville. There's an evil mastermind, known as Doctor Slag (PHD) who wants to use Adlai's long lost twin separated at birth, Dick, to wreak havoc on the town, then turn it into a nuclear wasteland. The exact reasoning behind wanting to do this escapes me, but the movie was just such a blast to watch in general you won't really care. It's a fun movie, your typical good-versus-evil z-movie fare, but fun nonetheless. The 'glowing hand' bit is hilarious, too. This is Brick Bronsky in his most versatile role. I really enjoyed it, it's only available on DVD through the boxed-set, though, which is unfortunate, because the boxed-set sells for upwards of ninety dollars in various places. I got mine new for twenty bucks due to good circumstance, but if you can find it, check it out! You probably won't regret it.

And there you have it, my awesome triple-review of the whole ""Class of Nuke 'Em High"" trilogy.
If you haven't seen 'em, and you're a fan of Troma, check them out, it's awesome to the max.
If you're looking for sexiness or just a bit of the old ultra-violence, then this is for you!",1258416000,4,3791,4.778625954198473
2206232,5,B0007989KC,"Bought this because a friend of mine was an extra in the third movie, so I wanted to surprise her with this set.....She was so excited.  Thanks for delivering this on time and in great condition",1209945600,,194,4.388888888888889
2206233,1,B0007989KC,This video was great back in the 80's and its still not bad now but i urge anyone who has seen the 1st one not to buy the others because they are utter rubbish and who ever made them should be killed.,1179014400,,200,3.7857142857142856
2206234,2,B0007989KC,"Class of Nuke 'Em High part 1 is OK (it IS a classic in gore movies).

Part 2 and part 3 shouldnt even EXIST!

It ain't like the serie Evil Dead..the first one is the only one you need to buy..the 2 others ain't worth the money spent to create those crappy movies.

On the + side: You get a sticker of I when to Class of NUKE 'EM HIGH! Woohooo! ;)

Conclusion..buy Class of Nuke 'Em High Part 1 and thats IT! Don't do the same error like I did.",1169078400,3,444,3.8461538461538463
2206235,2,B0007989KC,"I bought the first Class of nuke em high, by itself.  It was one of the funniest movies Troma has made.  It's so blatantly from the 80's it makes it great, some decent Troma gore thrown in, and hilarious characters.  It is a movie that for the most part you can follow and is well put together.  That said, I bought the trilogy as a way to get the other 2 together, thinking they would be at least as good.  Wrong.  I watched the second one and instantly you can tell the difference, if you own the first one and are contemplating getting this because you liked the first, don't bother.  They are 2 entirely different types of movies, seriously.  The second movie has a bunch of quirky music, stupid slapstick-style humor (people getting hit and a sound effect going ""bonk"" etc.)  Barely any gore worth mentioning or being funny for that matter.  The plot is impossible to follow as things keep switching pace and the story is really pathetic to begin with.  The acting is terrible and I don't mean that in a good way, I was falling asleep watching it.  The third movie however... is just the same.  I watched 20 minutes into it and then after seeing it was almost the same movie (same basic plot except a little further ahead in time) I fastforwarded through the rest of the movie looking for anything decent (something may be there that I missed) but overall I could find nothing worthy of noting.  So, buy the first one (it's so 80's that, that fact alone makes the movie), the rest I couldn't be paid to watch again.",1164758400,2,1520,4.420863309352518
2206236,5,B0007989KC,"These movies in my opinion are the seconed best Troma movies next to THE TOXIC AVENGER. They are extremely entertaining and loads of fun. The box set also comes with a nifty bumper sticker(Thus the title of this review)The DVDS are packed with excellent extras. Parts 2&3 are excellent also. In my opinion the best of the 3 in order are:
  1. Class of Nuke'em High
  2. Class of Nuke'em High Part 3: The Good The Bad and the Sub-Humanoid
  3. Class of Nuke'em High Part Two

If you like Troma Get this its a must have!",1146441600,6,518,4.278350515463917
2206237,4,B0007989KC,"im a huge troma fan so i purchased this nice box set.

the first movie is in the same vein as toxic avenger 1. pretty good.

the second is really weird. definately a good offering,but not the best thing troma has done.

the third...ive only watched a little bit of it. i can definately feel the 80's to 90's crossover in this one.

all in all, class of nuke em high will please toxic avenger fans, but i feel that the newer stuff is waaaaay better. make sure you have tromeo and juliet, terror firmer, and toxic avenger 4 before this set though.

definately recommended to 70's and 80's nerds who like the whole futuristic image. the so called ""punks"" should check this out too.",1139097600,2,678,4.392
2206238,4,B0007989KC,"For all you Toxic Avenger fans out there, I highly recomment this box set.  The DVD's have some really nice bonus features, and you get a lot of extra goodies with the box set.  A must for Troma fans.",1110326400,3,200,4.102564102564102

8046162,5,B0007989KC,"I have always been a fan of Troma movies ever since I can remember. The Toxic Avenger movies are my favorites, but the Class of Nuke 'Em High parts one and 2 come in a close 2nd. Part 3, not so much. But 2 out of 3 ain't bad as Meatloaf says. I really liked the newest one in the series too, ""Return to Nuke 'Em High"", but that is not a part of this box set. The first and original one in the series is the best, it is a true 80's B-movie classic. I love part 2 for it's complete over-the top ridiculousness, the zany characters, and of course the loveable giant mutant squirrel, Tromie.

This boxed set gives you all three original films, plus some great commentaries, interviews with some of the cast members, trailers, promos, and other behind the scenes tidbits of info and clips. Just buy it!

My only complaint is that I did not receive my ""I Love Tromaville High School"" bumper sticker with the set as was advertised on the front of the box. Otherwise it's a great collection that I will enjoy watching for years to come. Thanks, Troma, and congratulations on 40 years of Reel Independence!",1409011200,2,1097,4.3463414634146345
