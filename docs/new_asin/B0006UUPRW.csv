8510272,1,B0006UUPRW,This is awful. This woman is hard to understand...the recording quality is poor...and she just sort of rushes through everything. Totally overpriced piece of crap...sorry I bought it.,1324771200,,183,5.571428571428571
8510273,3,B0006UUPRW,"I bought this for my daughter, because there aren't any advanced tap classes where we live.  I thought this could keep her up on her tapping.  She didn't think it was advanced, I thought it would be more like fun advanced tap routines, instead it is a series of different steps.  It's probably good it you want to just learn a bunch of new steps, but if you are looking for a great advanced dance routines to learns, this is not it.",1279584000,,432,4.2439024390243905
8510274,5,B0006UUPRW,"This(Advanced Level) is the best in Ginger's tap series. It is easy to follow, very fun. It has some traditional steps and combinations like boogie step, riff(forward and backward), the chug, and slide, etc. One of the best tap DVD for beginning advanced level tappers, especially traditional tap dance lovers.",1124150400,8,310,5.22
8510275,5,B0006UUPRW,"I tried just about every other tape in the universe and was about to give up until I found Ginger's tap series--with great relief--and belief! You'd think by the time you reached advanced level, you wouldn't need any help--but not true. First of all, it helps you polish all those rough edges that still need work, but nobody else will take the time to teach. Second of all, it gives something for all the Intermediate level people to aspire to--and accomplish. And third, once you've mastered all of the above, you can simply invite all your other tap friends in--and have a good time.

True believer,
