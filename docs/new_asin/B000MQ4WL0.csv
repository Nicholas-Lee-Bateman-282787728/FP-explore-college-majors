2738452,4,B000MQ4WL0,"Taking her stand-up routine to the ""big house"" - Mo'nique performs at a women's prison. The DVD features extra footage of her interaction with the inmates. Many of these ladies are serving life sentences, so prison IS their life & they must make the best of it. From the stage, utilizing her signature style, she encourages these women to stop fighting amongst themselves. For those who will be returning to society, Mo'nique incorporates a strong message to these ladies about ""keeping your chin up, being beautiful & never returning to prison.""

If the ""b"" offends you - I will tell you this DVD is not for you. As it's use is second only to breathing throughout the routine. Nevertheless, this is a powerful performance. Mo'nique displays more compassion than ever before. When one of the inmates shares the stage & sings, make sure you have a Kleenex handy.

In short, if you enjoy stand-up comedy - performed with style - Mo'nique never disappoints. This DVD goes one step further - relating the importance of friendship, self respect and so much more.",1178928000,5,1057,4.834254143646409

2738464,4,B000MQ4WL0,"Wow...I love comedy, and for some reason I enjoy shows centered around prison life. This one grabbed me enough to grab it, just for grins. Wow...I will tell you. There is not enough soap in the world to wash out Mo'Nique's mouth in this routine, but considering that this is the prison milieu we are looking at, I wouldn't expect this to read like a Sunday sermon....Life under lockdown is obviously gritty and harsh and this microcosm of the world is used to abrasive language. Be prepared for a lot of m-f's, the ""b"" word, and a few Lord's name in vain....However I gotta hand it to Mo'nique as you can tell that she genuinely cares about the plight of the female inmates, and a little comic relief fits the bill. Kudos to the inmate towards the end with her uplifting gospel number...It shows that for some, spirits can be beaten, but never ever broken, even in a reformatory.",1436659200,3,879,4.534591194968553

2738491,5,B000MQ4WL0,"Mo'nique says many times throughout that she could have easily been their cellmate, and I think it's something most of us can say we've experienced if we get angry enough. She picks one of the toughest women's prisons in the nation, and she sets out with two goals. At first you think the first goal is to make them laugh, and us when we view it. In fact, most of us certainly bought the thing not because of the prison factor, but because Mo'nique cracks us up. But by the end, it's become so much more. A great deal of these women killed out of anger at betrayal or heartbreak. Many more because they were abused and wanted out. Some are hardcore criminals, and other's just repeat offenders... But what Mo'nique wants us all to realize is that they are still people, and they still matter. I come from a home with physical abuse, severe even. On the final night, after 11 years, when my mom had finally had enough, she broke my dad's arm and busted his face with a hammer. Had he died, she's have been right in the same situation as MANY of these women, who just took their rage at being repeatedly beaten that one step too far... Yes, this video will move you, and we'll see Mo'nique big heart to go right along with her big sense of humor and beauty. Honestly though, the show stopper was when one of the toughest girls in the prison gets up onstage and sings, and took my breath away. And as she and Mo'nique talked, tears poured down this truly hardcore criminal's face, and they poured down Mo'nique's, and they poured down mine... And I came away with a little more understanding, and I called a cousin of mine who'd been in prison off and on for drugs, just so she could know that someone still cares... If you love Mo'nique, then you will love this special. It will make you laugh outroariously like all of Mo'nique's humor, but it will also show you a side of things that none of probably ever even stop to think about... It's true, what they say... criminals, whatever the flavor, get thrown away by society. Laugh, cry, and come away with a new point of view. And really, is there any better compliment about how great this special is? You won't be disappointed.

  Thanks so much for your time folks.
  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell",1312156800,5,2242,4.432038834951456
2738492,4,B000MQ4WL0,"what I did not expect from this show was as to how very insightful it was on women's prison and their inmates and how they cope with their lives as they serve their time.  Mo'Nique very cleverly throws in a mini documentary throwing light on the background of a few of the inmates and the prison guards and their coexistence. Mo'Nique is bold, honest and most of all extremely funny. A beautiful comedienne who should bask in all her fame and glory.",1296950400,,449,4.475609756097561
2738493,3,B000MQ4WL0,"She may cussed and is nasty , I don't like it . But I don't look at that for a factor. I was looking at how she treats cellmates to keep them laughing and let them know they can STILL do anything they dream of. It is touched. I know she has nice side even thru she cuss, ppl just don't see it. They are too busy judging her. She told them to not come back! That what got me smile and she almost cried when a girl hitted note about she is not worrying about tomorrow because she still have God in life. WOW (applaude) ....",1283126400,,521,3.878504672897196

2738495,4,B000MQ4WL0,Monique is great as always!  I loved her though in Phat Girlz best though!  She really shined in that movie!!!,1245542400,,110,4.45
2738496,5,B000MQ4WL0,wow! this is some funny stuff! she's super funny and this dvd actually brings a message of inspiration!,1239062400,,103,4.777777777777778
2738507,4,B000MQ4WL0,"I think Monique did a good job on this DVD. People making time are forgotten about sometimes, but they need a laugh just just like everyone else does when they have been on good behavior . My favorite part was the woman that came and did a gospel solo, and she tore it up. I cried and cried and cried everytime I listened to her. She has a wonderful voice and they never did say how much time this young lady has, but I hope that she was able to get out and pursue her gift.",1234828800,2,474,3.9479166666666665
2738508,2,B000MQ4WL0,"A couple of reasons why I didn't like this project:

a) Monique tends to tell the same jokes in all of her routines.  These women have been locked up for many years, many are never getting out.  I thought that they (and those who support Monique) deserved a better show.
b) Too much profanity.  She is already a funny lady.  Lazy people, however, lean on profanity when creativity is lacking (see above).  I know for a fact that she could have done better.  She isn't a lazy woman by any means, but it is painfully evident that she wasn't motivated here.

What I loved about this project, however, was the interviews she had with some of the inmates, and that rousing encore song by one of the female prisoners at the end.  She had everyone crying (including me!).  I hope that Monique kept her promise to that young lady long after the cameras stopped rolling. For these reasons alone, I gave two stars.",1221004800,,904,4.49079754601227
2738509,5,B000MQ4WL0,I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I AM SO GLAD THAT I ORDERED THIS VIDEO FROM THE VERY VERY BEST AMAZON. IT'S ALWAYS RIGHT ON TIME. AND I WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM ANYONE ANY WHERE ELSE AGAIN. THANK-YOU AMAZON.,1219622400,,203,4.1

2738511,5,B000MQ4WL0,Very Very Very funny; classic Monique at her best. This comedy/docuentary of these incarcerated women was as touching as Monique was hilarious.,1206489600,,143,5.545454545454546
2738512,4,B000MQ4WL0,"I am not a prude, but I could not completely enjoy Mo'Nique ""I coulda Been Your Cellmate."" Although the show was funny, it was very raunchy. It was great that Mo'Nique performed for women in prison. Mo'nique seems to genuinely care about the women. She advised them to be more cordial to each other, and to stay out when they get out.
It was a great moment when one inmate sang; such a beautiful voice.",1191888000,5,402,4.373333333333333

2738515,4,B000MQ4WL0,"I have always dug Mo'Nique because she just does her thing. this was a very creative move on her part that will remind some of Johnny cash going to Folsom Prison and other Entertainers who have performed at Prisons. but Mo'Nique gives this Performance a Comic spin along with also touching on the Human side of it which is often forgotten. she  acknowledges the Warden, the victims and also the Prisoneers who are in Lock down. the Women of this Ohio Prison truly connected and Bonded with Mo'Nique.  it was very touching when the One  Woman came up near the end of the show to perform that Gospel Number. that was very touching.  Mo'Nique talks real on this.",1180137600,6,659,4.559322033898305
2738516,4,B000MQ4WL0,Monique was funny and a tad raunchy as usual. But this video was different because it featured the touching stories of women incarcerated for various reasons giving a human face to women who have basically been thrown away by society.,1179100800,9,234,4.875
