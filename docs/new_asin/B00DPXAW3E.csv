Was this movie very popular? Did it rob people of their illusions about a popular sport? Newspapers and television carried a lot of boxing news in the 1950s. Was this movie based on a true story? You can look at todays newspapers to see what product is being pushed. Movies that advertised in newspapers could usually expect favorable reviews to attract an audience (in most cases). The editor of a newspaper would play the news to please the owner. You can tell the owners politics by its news coverage. [The Patterson-Johanssen bouts from 1958 were a good example of fights whose publicity didn't match the actual results.]",1389830400,,3515,4.478939157566303
