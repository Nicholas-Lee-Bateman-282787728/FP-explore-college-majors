8161812,3,B000LE1GC6,"It' okay. Price is right. Shipping was fast. The dealer did their part, I'm jut not real happy with the quality of the video, but that's not the dealers fault. I would purchase from this dealer again.",1403136000,,200,4.4324324324324325
8161813,3,B000LE1GC6,"Well, the video has a few goodies like Sam Ryan's solos and the 2 lesbo scenes with Zoe and Angie. It disappointed me overall. With the ending I expected a huge orgy with all the girls but didn't get it. It's ok though",1401321600,,218,4.093023255813954
8161814,5,B000LE1GC6,"Each person has his own tastes and opinions. Mine is that Celeste Star and Jennifer Lee (a.k.a. Christine Nguyen) are the most attractive ladies in this DVD I bought from ""amazon.com"". Jennifer's sexiest scenes are in it, and Celeste's scenes are close to hers in ""A Genie's Wish"" that has her sexiest ones. The other girls are OK I guess, but I watch mainly Celeste and Jennifer. Zoe Britton is a brunette but is a bit chubby for my taste, and two blondes are forgettable to me. I don't recall their names now. I just checked on it. Angie Savage isn't bad, but she suffers by comparison to the fit brunettes I usually prefer, e.g. Celeste Star and Jennifer Lee in this DVD. Samantha Ryan doen't turn me on, so she and Zoe Britton are the least attractive girls here to me. My ratings are: 1. Celeste Star, 2. Jennifer Lee, 3. Angie Savage, 4. Samantha Ryan, 5. Zoe Britton the covergirl on the box.",1316390400,3,899,4.454545454545454
8161815,5,B000LE1GC6,"This is one of the absolute best Peach DVDs on the market, with a great combination of attractive women, lots and lots of bare skin (including graphic nudity going beyond fleeting glances), fantastic camerawork, a fun and cute idea and  even a great sound track! And to boot, a 13-minute behind-the-scenes feature!

The only drawback to this one, in my opinion, is that the women here aren't Peach's hottest. Zoe Britton is amazing but aside from her, these aren't the A-listers.",1300406400,5,479,4.901234567901234
8161816,4,B000LE1GC6,"If your idea of a good time is cute girls on roller skates making out with each other then this is the movie for you.  In an hour's running time you get about 4 minutes of dialog, a background of typical adult film music and lots of 80's roller disco fashions, complete with cute girls on traditional skates (not roller blades).  There is no male/female intercourse in this movie but a lot of female nudity and girl/girl action. The movie is listed as ""not rated"" and I don't know how ratings are determined but this movie has plenty of full nudity, so be aware! There aren't that many movies out there with girls in traditional roller skates, so if that's your retro thing, this is a good one.",1214092800,19,694,4.4140625
