I liked the episode back when i could find it free, and decided to buy it now that i cant. which is a big deal for me. now the bad thing is that the bonus content is horrible. its old/poorly done and dum dum-dum-dum DUMB!the trailers are for equally bad/poorly done stuff, but all in all i am happy to have it. second disk though? waste of space.",1333411200,,390,4.012820512820513
