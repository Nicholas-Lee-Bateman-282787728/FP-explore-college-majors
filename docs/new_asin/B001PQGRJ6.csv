8334271,5,B001PQGRJ6,"The history of Finland's war with The Soviets and The Finn's allegiance with Germany during WWII is for me, a great history that I had to ""uncover"" and study for myself. This War was not discussed in my history classes; since the advent of the online world much has been uncovered and has become available to us in The U.S. For me , the Finnish movies such as The Unknown Soldier and Talvisota 1989 provide a striking contrast to our manner of recording war films. It gives the average American a different perspective in many ways. The ferocity of the combat in both films, especially Talvisota reaches a point previously not attained in American films. Generation War is another example of a different perspective since it was recorded in Germany and the ""good guys"" are indeed German soldiers. Any of these European films are classics in their own way; thanks to the internet. I am 58 years old and I can remember when these different perspectives simply were not available to us over here. 5 stars go to Tuntematon Sotilas. The director, Pirkka-Pekka Petelius also directed Talvisota 1989; the similarities are so obvious. He is a craftsman in recording fierce combat films.",1523232000,,1178,4.836633663366337
8334272,5,B001PQGRJ6,"This truly magnificent film takes place on the Russian-Finnish battlefront 1941-44, during what is historically known as the Continuation War. Wikipedia has a pretty good resume of this strange chapter in WWII, albeit perhaps a little too kind towards the Finns and their motives for fighting alongside Nazi-Germany against Russia. However, to understand this movie it is well worth consulting Wikipedia first.

The name of the war itself is a cunning bit of propaganda manipulation, aimed at isolating it from the rest of WWII and giving the impression that it was a logical continuation of the Winter War (1939-40), in which Finland had struggled alone to withstand massive Russian attacks. This war had gained almost full support among the Finnish population and a vast amount of international sympathy. However, the Finnish participation in the German attacks on Russia from July 1941 onwards was more than just an attempt to win back the territories lost in the Winter War. Influential extreme right-wing groups in Finland were dreaming of colonising parts of Russia, for which they claimed that Finland had a historical right (and possibly more than that, too). It is the philosophy behind this movie that these political forces within parts of the Finnish upper-class and among professional officers lead the nation into this war, which resulted in both severe casualties for the Finns as well as developed a national trauma due to the country's very active support of Nazi-Germany, a completely unsuitable situation for a modern, democratic Nordic state.

The film is built on a novel of the same name, published first in the mid-1950s by the Finnish writer Vin Linna, a kind of literary equivalent of Jean Sibelius. It is an extremely multi-facetted book that can be read in several ways. While it makes no attempts to hide the horrors of war, it also has a strong humorous side. The novel var first made into a film a couple of years after its initial publication and this early version very much drew on the humorous aspect. It doesn't seem quite in line with the author's overall political intentions, and certainly this more current film (from 1985) goes much deeper into what the war was really all about - and well beyond. It is directed by Rauni Mollberg, a internationally highly acclaimed Finnish film director, and in many aspects it precedes the wave of American war films we have seen in later years, using close-up hand held camera technique and extremely realistic scenery. However, compared to even the better among the more modern attempts, such as the television series 'Band of Brothers', this movie is considerably less self-glorifying (comparing it with 'Platoon' would be more appropriate in this respect, while the grainy quality and the natural light brings 'Tigerland' to mind - it has indeed been suggested that the makers of these subsequent movies have been watching 'The Unknown Soldier' very closely). In fact, every single minute in this film is earth-shatteringly relevant and 'true' in a hemingway-esque meaning of the word. The acting is so outrageously good it almost hurts to watch, and if you want to focus on the battle scenes it is obvious that these actors are not a bunch of multi-millionaire Hollywood film stars who have been through a two week boot camp - they have done their full National Service, as you have to in Finland, and they know what it is truly like to be a grunt.

The story follows two machine-gun groups in the Finnish army and their platoon leader Koskela, a veteran from the Winter War. During attacks the groups are generally used to back one regular infantry platoon in particular, lead by a young Lieutenant Kariluoto. Much of the film is based around these characters as well as corporals Letho and Hietanen. It also delves quite deep into the relationship between the latter and a private called Rahikainen. Equally important is Rokka, a recalled reservist with a personal reason for disliking the Russians and a unique ability to get up his superiors' noses. (Finnish names tend to look more peculiar than they really are. The Finnish ""nen"" at the end of sir names is the equivalent of the English ""son"", and words are always pronounced with very soft consonants and emphasis on first syllable.)

Apart from that there is really only one thing to do with this movie: watch it and be moved. The English subtitles are good and easy to follow (at least when I compare them to the Swedish ones, which I assume are very close to the Finnish spoken in the film), but if you're like me you will end up watching this movie so many times you won't need them any more.

To label this a war film isn't really comprehensive enough, because it reaches much further than that. It is simply a film about life, about human beings for better or worse, about good and bad leadership, about manipulation of the masses - and people's ability to withstand it with irony. It is a film about the importance of humor and about friendship. But perhaps more than anything else it is - typically for Finnish movies - a film about nature. Towards the end of it you almost have the feeling that the characters are physically melting into the landscape - even those who survive this horrible disaster of a war, which, according to Vin Linna, the ruling classes in Finland forced upon their own people.",1287014400,11,5347,4.871428571428571
8334273,3,B001PQGRJ6,"First of all,this is not a war movie, it is an anti-war movie,So expect grimness, tragedy and lots and lots of blood . Secondly it is  pretty faithful to the novel ""The Unknown Soldier "" (Tuntematon Sotilas), by Vaino Linna , a Finnish author with a definite leftist slant on Finnish politics. Virtually all upper or middle class officers are shown as fools , only interested in drill and discipline , who think nothing of wasting the lives of their poor conscripts in doomed battles in an unnecessary  war. The higher the officer the more foolish and vicious  he is.
  Also this film has not managed to carry over the irony and tragic humour that make the novel a very good read (the 1950's black and white film version which is readily available, chose  to emphasize the humour and prettyed up the tragedy so it is an easier film to watch). Some humour is there in this new version and it saves the film dramatically.
The film also suffers from the same problem of how to present a central character, Lieutenant Koskela , the young peasant  farmboy who becomes a really outstanding officer.  The older film failed and so does this. He is simply portrayed as too  passionless and self-involved to be the leader he is supposed to be . Also in the novel he is  24 ,only a few years older than his men. In this film he looks about 35.
The films good points : It is a very realistic presentation of war and combat. The cast most of whom seem the right age 18 to 21 ,are believable. Dramatically the film carries you along pretty well , though it doesnt seem to know how to end , so it just dwells on some more bloody bodies for far too long -we got the message earlier.
 Some personal criticisms  of the film and the novel from which it comes : First the canard that the Lotta Svards the Finnish women's auxiliary services were really useless and a bunch of ""whores"" is disgusting and absurd! That Vaino Linna was recounting the attitude of some lower class conscripts towards them doesnt excuse this -the film makers knew better and should have shown  it. Also, if the Finnish leadership was as bad as depicted in the film, the Finnish soldiers so starved and mistreated , why was Finland able to hold off the Soviets for so long?
  The 100,000 Lotta Svards served in all kinds of vital roles , medical , clerical ,transport ,etc. , releasing probably 100,000 men for combat duties (for a Finnish army of about 350,000 this was an incredible advantage). A second canard, that the Finnish air force was noticeable by its absence. Totally untrue ! The Finnish air force had a kill ratio in 1939 -1944 of 16 to 1 against their Soviet foe who outnumbered  them by possibly 20 to 1 in aircraft , without the FAF  the Reds would have commanded the skies over Finland from the start and the Finnish-Soviet wars would have been quite different.

See this film if you want tob assured that all war is wrong, or see it ti find out what some Finns think about the legend of ""Heroic Finland"" or see it just to hear Finnish spoken as I did.",1284076800,11,3025,4.439421338155515
