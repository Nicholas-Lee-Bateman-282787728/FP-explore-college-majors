8189289,5,B000P6R71O,I was very Satisfied with my concert DVD's. Took them to a Friends hous the weekend after I received them and we sure had a good time watching them and Sharing memories.,1402358400,,169,4.3125
8189290,4,B000P6R71O,"I purchased a three tape DVD of Gary Lewis & The Playboys, which I really enjoyed. Brought me back to the days of riding in my 1969 G.T.O. Really good memories, came back to me. I also heard the associations, by the way again  this was a 3 pack concert, 3 Artists were featured. Association were great and again took me back to some great times back in the sixties. The next Artist was Gary Puckett?
With this DVD, I was disappointed? I remember Gary Puckett & The Union Gap riding around in my 1969 Goat. He was Awesome. But His DVD
he was on today, I was very disappointed. He was Awesome in his day though! The DVD's  were perfect. No Problems at all. These tapes do take you back to the good old days.",1306713600,,705,4.176470588235294
8189291,3,B000P6R71O,"This is the ONLY DVD of the Association available. Russ and Larry are fine but I really miss Jim and Jules. Gary Lewis was great. Both the music and the stories were enjoyable. Gary Puckett was not good. These DVDs are available separately. The Association 3*, Gary Lewis 4*, Gary Puckett 2*.",1298505600,,292,4.634615384615385
8189292,2,B000P6R71O,The only dvd I had a problem with was Gary Puckett and the Union Gap. I have always liked the way Gary sounded back in the seventies. I know that the voice goes after many years but the way Gary  sounds on this dvd is a joke! The voice is totally gone and then he tries to make up for it. Does not sound at all like him! I do not recommend this DVD. He should never have recorded this and rather left us with the pleasant memories of years gone by.,1265155200,,448,3.869565217391304
8189293,2,B000P6R71O,"Sadly, the performances caught here aren't always what they should be. This is a much later version of The Association and the sound isn't quite right and some of the songs are shaky. The other shows aren't consistantly strong and there's this annoyingly fake ""applause swell"" that becomes painfully apparent when they show the audience sitting still during the fake applause. A more intimate setting would have helped, but this could have been done much better. Recommended only for those who are ardent fans of these artists and want everything in their archive.",1251590400,2,564,5.075268817204301
8189294,5,B000P6R71O,"I received this product in a timely matter, ... its great watching these Pop Legends!!! Being a child of the 60s,... I'd recommend this to anyone from that era. Takes me WAY back!!!

Received from the seller in a timely matter.",1214611200,,227,4.536585365853658
8189295,1,B000P6R71O,"I looked forward to watching these concerts, after watching many of the 60's groups on great PBS concerts. BIG disappointment. Gary Puckett and Gary Lewis didn't sound anything like they did years ago =no resemblence at all. It could have been strangers trying to sing their songs. The Association was so-so. Their voices were weak and the harmony sometimes clashed. This concert series is totally depressing, and the DVD set is trash as far as I'm concerned. I can see now why these former hit singers were not on any of the PBS 60's reunion concerts!",1211932800,5,552,4.760416666666667
8189296,5,B000P6R71O,I bought this video because in September I plan on seeing Gary Puckett & the Union Gap in concert.  This brings back many memories.  Thanks,1210464000,,139,4.52
