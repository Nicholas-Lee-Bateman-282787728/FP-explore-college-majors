8554784,4,B00ANQHTR8,"In 2010 and 2011, Marvel Studios collaborated with Japanese studio Madhouse to produce four anime series based on Marvel properties, which take the relevant characters to Japan. Three of them are obvious choices: two focus on X-Men characters, and one on the popular Iron Man.

But the fourth series was a slightly less obvious choice: Blade, the longcoat-wearing, vampire-slaying dhampir. Since Blade's whole schtick is slaying vampires, that gives ""Marvel Anime: Blade, Season 1, Vol. 1"" a distinctly darker, bloodier tone than its three sister series -- expect lots of gore, monsters, exploding vamps, and a number of bloodsuckers who don't fit the Anne Rice/Bram Stoker mold.

Before he was born, Blade (aka Eric Brooks) was infected with vampirism when a strange four-fanged vampire attacked his mother. As a result, he has all of the vampire's superhuman abilities... but he can fight his bloodthirst and walk in the daylight. And once his mentor Noah Van Helsing helped him to control his thirst, he began searching for the vampire who had cursed both him and his mother.

And at last, he discovers who it was: the cruel Deacon Frost, a leader among vampires. But Frost quickly flees to Asia, forcing Blade to follow him. And in turn, Blade finds himself with a new companion: a young vampire-hunter named Makoto.

Unfortunately for Blade, Asia is a very large place, and Deacon Frost seems to be constantly moving around. As Blade tracks him, he encounters vampires in all sorts of places -- a blood farm in the heart of Japan, an attack while on Van Helsing's hired boat, a flesh-eating monster attacking a small Filipino village, and a Sumatran village being used as slave labor (when they aren't turned into bolongs).

""Marvel Anime: Blade, Season 1, Vol. 1"" contains only the first half of this anime series, but it's enough to give you a pretty solid idea of what the story is like. This is a darker, more tragic tale than the other Marvel animes, especially since Blade himself is a character rooted in horror and tragedy. And the story reflects it, with a number of likable, good people being destroyed amidst bloody, acrobatic vampire fights.

And trust me, there is plenty of blood, fire and bladed weapons flying everywhere. But the anime also sometimes slows down to explore Blade's backstory -- the people he's lost, the struggle against his bloodlust, and how he was forged into an awesome vampire-hunter. The episode devoted to the loss of his foster family, and the horrifying events that led to him swearing vengeance against Frost, is absolutely heartwrenching.

And even though we have the foppish European/American vampire types. there's also lots of vampires exclusive to Asian legends -- flying reptilian torso Manananggals, harpy-like Mandurugos, water tiger monsters, and the stretchy-necked bolongs. If nothing else, it's an education on folklore.

As for the characters, Blade can feel a little wooden as a character, until his backstory reveals that he's just incredibly repressed because of his determination to fight his vampire side. He's balanced out by the more impulsive, emotional Makoto, and the pleasantly paternal Van Helsing. Harold Perrineau's voice acting is pretty solid as well, despite the occasional Christian Bale growl, and he's backed by a solid voice actor cast including Kim Mai Guest, Troy Baker, and the odd appearance by J. B. Blanc.

""Marvel Anime: Blade, Season 1, Vol. 1"" introduces a darker, more heated, bloodier type of Marvel anime -- but be sure to have the second half of the series on hand, just to find out what happens next. Hint: sniktbub.",1476835200,,3611,5.035175879396985
