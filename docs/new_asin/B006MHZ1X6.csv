8500856,5,B006MHZ1X6,"GREAT DVD, picture is clear and because it's been digitally remastered.
It is unlike some DVDs of old movies that the pictures were blurry, grainy and fading and seems to be produced by Desert Island videos and Mr fat-W videos. I now avoid these two productions like I avoiding defects because there are defects.",1471305600,,312,4.796296296296297

8500858,4,B006MHZ1X6,"Surprisingly good euro-crime/poliziotteschi with fantastic photography shot in beautiful Milano. It's much better than Castellari's ""Street Law"". The performances by all the actors are great. For only $6,99 this is a must have. Beautiful cover.",1400284800,2,244,6.0
8500859,3,B006MHZ1X6,"Italian Film maker Fernando Di Leo turns his director reins over to Director Romolo Guerrieri and scribes Raro Video's latest crime release 'YOUNG VIOLENT DANGEROUS' aka 'LIBERI ARMATI PERICOLOSI'- 1976 , a film posing as a poliziottesci genre film from the DVD box cover art but emerges as a routine juvenile delinquent film which Hollywood B-movie makers cranked out during the late fifties.  This time the violence is more prolific but the main leads are purely one dimensional as we are asked to convey emotion to three spoiled misfits who go on a violent killing crime spree( which is never explained but the film tries to blame the parents of the trio for their lack of communication and guidance) climaxing in a violent showdown within their clique.  Actor Tomas Milian, who to me will always be the Italian Al Pacino, takes back stage to the three leads as the inspector and the beautiful Eleanora Giorgi plays one of the trio's girlfriend and hostage and provides the eventual gratuitous topless scene which aids them during their chase. Director Guerrieri who directed a few Spaghetti Westerns such as my favorite '10,000 DOLLARS FOR A MASSACRE' aka '10,000 DOLLARI PER UN MASSACRO'-1967 and the underrated Giallo 'THE SWEET BODY OF DEBORAH' aka 'IL DOLCE CORPO DI DEBORAH'-1968 moves the film at a breezy clip using on-location shots throughout.  The only real thorn in the side is the up beat Harmonica oriented music score by Enrico Pieranunzi which throws off the feel of the film.  Raro Video releases it in a 1.85 transfer with slight green speckles and a blatant blue line showing up dead center during a shot but overall is quite nice and could almost pass as a 1080P Blu-Ray release.  Extras are slightly skimpy with a documentary 'RAGAZZI FUORI' including a great interview with Director Guerrieri and his thoughts on the film and his actors , a director biography and filmography and a Bonus Rom RDM/PDF file containing a booklet on the film which Raro Video usually provides in the slip case but which is absent here.  Recommended to Euro Crime fans only.",1373500800,4,2077,4.886363636363637
