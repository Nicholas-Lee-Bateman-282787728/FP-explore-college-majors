In addition, there is very little additional material.  Why is there not more extra options? I would love to see various versions of the game intro that is shown on the Autzen jumbotron prior to each game.

Do a comparison from each year.  That would be great.  But there are just highlights from each game.

Good, but not great.",1392076800,,424,4.371794871794871

The service from Amazon was delivered with great packaging and was shipped to my house before the estimated due date.  What great service.  Thanks again Amazon for great service.",1331078400,,280,4.653061224489796
