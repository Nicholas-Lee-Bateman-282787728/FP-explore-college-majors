4336342,4,B004ECFWAI,"I agree that it's too bad we do not have the 2004 performance, which I didn't see, so I can't compare it to this one.  But I was in the audience at this performance, and it was absolutely gripping.  You couldn't turn your head away from Karita Matilla, even when others were singing.  She was in constant motion, feline, playful, a little out of control.  When she stripped, it was more sensual live than what comes across with this camerawork.  At the climactic moment, I have to confess I had my opera glasses trained on her, and believe me, her body is still quite beautiful.  As for her singing, I felt that the warmth of her more mature voice, together with the slight strain at the top, just added to the intensity of her performance.  This strange guy (Jochanan) just drove her out of her mind, making her go far beyond where a spoiled brat princess should go.  I felt the Jochanan was good, but I agree, it would have been better if he were more physically attractive, as I've seen in other productions.  Kim Begley as Herod sang very clearly (I could understand much of his German), with much less barking than in other productions.  Herodias was a bit over the top, but it worked.  As for the orchestra, I very much liked the sound on this dvd, although it can never sound as good as it did in the house.  As others have pointed out, none of the available dvd versions is perfect, so just enjoy what's good about each of them (if you have the time and the money!).",1305504000,6,1474,4.3786764705882355
4336343,3,B004ECFWAI,"This is an excellent DVD, but I feel a bit cheated.
In the production at the Met. Salome stripped
completely, if only momentarily, naked. The DVD
has seen fit to eliminate this short view of her
nakedness.
  Dirty old man.",1303257600,4,222,4.525
4336344,1,B004ECFWAI,The director must be joking. How can you take a biblical story and transport in to the 1930's? Herod in a three piece suit is ludicrous. And Salome is no young sex kitten and was an embarrassment she was so miscast and her dancing makes you laugh. Sorry could not finish this mess it was so disturbing. Looking forward to reviewing other versions.,1298073600,10,347,4.523809523809524
4336345,4,B004ECFWAI,"The Metropolitan Opera has released this fine 2008 performance of Richard Strauss' Salome as part of a Sony series of Met Live in HD broadcasts, now available on DVD and Blu-Ray. Karita Mattila is the title role--the princess of Judea who does the most famous strip-tease in history in exchange for the head of Jokaanan (John the Baptist.)

The Finnish soprano is a slinky, blonde force of nature in this production, soaring to Strauss' glittering vocal peaks and meeting all the physical challenges of the role. Playful at first, monstrous at the end, her Salome is a little girl gone very wrong. And yes, she does the Dance of the Seven Veils herself, although the camera cuts away (to a thrilled Herod) at the moment when she bares all.

The object of her desire is fellow Finn Juha Uusitalo. This is a voice and star in development. His rich, dark bass has resonance and power, and much potential. However, his Jokaanan sounds better when echoing out of the cistern. He produces a vibrato which grows more pronounced as the role goes on, and is most noticeable when Jokaanan curses Salome. Kim Begley is a reliable, experienced Herod in the late stages of his career. Ildik Komlski is a large-voiced, if unsteady Herodias. Joseph Kaiser displays a fine, light tenor as Narraboth.

Ms. Mattila's finest moments come after the Veils, when she floats her first ""den kopf des Jokaanan"" with a pianissimo high note, then plunging into the depths for the sprechstimme phrases where she demands the head. She turns on the power in the final scene, singing to the severed head with warmth and passion, scaling those forbidding high notes in a fearless performance.
Jrgen Flimm's production re-imagines the work as a cocktail party at the end of the world, against a backdrop of 20th century doo-wop archictecture. A scaffold and mine-shaft splits the middle of the stage. From this, a rusted, metal dumb-waiter arises, revealing the bound, blindfolded, and later, beheaded Jokaanan--without his body. This is an effective moment.

This was an early Live in HD effort, and the opportunity to see this particular opera close-up (very close up) lends the drama a whole new dimension. It appears that the recording team was still learning where to put the microphones, and the singers' breathing is audible. (This is particularly disturbing when Ms. Mattila has kissed the bloody head.) The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra is in exceptional form, led by Patrick Summers in a bravura performance.",1297468800,5,2484,4.978313253012049
4336346,3,B004ECFWAI,"This new release of Salome will do little to appease those of us tho have been waiting for a release of the 2004 staging. Rumor had it that the earlier production had been taped. Perhaps this was never the case, but the internet being what it is many of us had assumed that it was only a matter of time. I did not see it but did hear the production on the radiio; it was quite exciting and Mattila was thrilling. I missed the 2008 HD release ini theatres and didn't listen to the broadcast.

If there is an earlier  taping extant with the release of this later revival it is unlikely that the 2004 edition will see the light of day--a pity. I can only echo most of what Ivy Lin has already written. The camera is cruel in the close ups of Mattila. In the house this probably would not be a problem, but in HD it does no favors for the diva. She has retained her figure and is able to wear a dress that would not look out of place in a thirties movie. Vocally four years have robbed the voice of much of the freshness that was evident in 2004 and her low notes are almost growled.

The rest of the cast surely does not represent a major house at its best. The Jochannan, Juha Uusutalo, sounded underpowered and parched whether from the cistern (I assume electronic assistance was used) or on stage. Neither did he command the sort of charisma physically that one associates with this role. Herod has frequently been the home of aging heldentenors but Kim Begley (to the best of my knowledge) has not had a career in Wagner.  Even so the sounds that he emits are not steady nor are they mellifluous. More egregious is the singing of Ildiko Komlosi. Painful is the only adjective that comes to mind.

Patrick Summers is not a name that I would have associated with Strauss but can I blame the recording engineers as well? As Ivy Lin has pointed out there is none of the sensuousness that one associates with Strauss. At a number of points I had to reduce the volume, only to increase it at a later point. Admittedly this is not the only DVD to be found guilty of this, but surely by now recording engineers should have resolved the problem. True the house erupted in cheers and bravos and I suspect being there made some difference as to how the sound was perceived.

I have resisted all the previous existing Salome DVD's for a variety of reasons. The Stratas is a film, but right now it is looking better all the time. Malfitano has two tapings and the supporting casts are clearly superior to this new entry; the diva not only has to deal with the camera as an enemy, she has a tendency to overact in the manner of the silent film era. The German Nadja Michael has also made two tapings but she has a voice that does not caress the ear and is willing to throw caution to the winds and go for broke dramatically. The results can be exciting on occasionn but one wonders for how long can she sing this music--any music? Maria Ewing created a mild sensation when she sang her first Salome in Los Angeles and then  took it to London where it was taped. By that time the role had taken its toll on her voice and all that was left was a mannered performance. The void has yet to be filled.",1296432000,13,3183,4.286189683860233
4336347,2,B004ECFWAI,"Mattila is showing her age and anyone who raves about this performance must not have heard many performances or recordings. It's ok but leaves something to be desired - aside from a decent staging. If you REALLY want to hear the power of this score, search out the 1949 Met broadcast with Welitsch under Reiner (on several labels but you may have to search Amazon.co.uk).",1296345600,6,371,4.723076923076923
4336348,5,B004ECFWAI,"Strauss' decadent opera Salome has always posed a major problem in casting the lead character of Salome herself.  Either you get a soprano that has ""the voice"" for the role (i.e., can ""ride"" Strauss' orchestra) but is not physically believable in the role (i.e. a little chunky and too matronly to be a young ""sex kitten"") OR a soprano is cast that is  slim, trim and considered to be believable as desirable BUT with a voice unable to meet the vocal demands of the role (I.e.. battle Strauss' orchestra and able to plummet into the low notes of the role) Karita Mattila possesses BOTH requirements of the role.  She has a voice that is well able to ride Strauss' orchestra and ride it she does with gleaming tones able to soar to the stratosphere one moment and plunge to the depths the next--the extreme range of the role seem to hold no terrors for her PLUS she is physically believable-- she plays the very demanding little ""sex starved"" young girl very well--so flirtatious and playful.

This production is not set in biblical times but, I suppose it is considered a modern production being set in what I think is the 1930s.  Whenever, I enjoyed it, to me, it really works very well for this opera.  All of the secondary roles are well done.  I especially enjoyed ""bosomy"" and drunk Ildiko Komlosi as Herodias.  However, I must say, that Karita's performance simply knocked me out; she is fantastic on this DVD.  I am so glad that they taped Karita Mattila as Salome because after seeing this DVD, I feel that she truly is the Salome of our age.

In case you are wondering, Karita manages to do a very discreet but sensual ""dance"".  From what I understand, this filmed version of the ""dance"" was altered for PBS in order to avoid it being censored because originally, Karita stripped ""all the way"".  In this DVD, Mattila remains partially clothed throughout the entire dance but still manages to be alluring.

By the way, the sound and picture on this Sony DVD  is great,

8426690,5,B004ECFWAI,"Mattila is easily the best Salome in recorded history. She's able to bring it in performances of Manon Lescaut, Tosca, Jenufa and Salome - clearly a force to be reckoned with. Her diction is clear, her note definition is en pointe, her acting is more than enough to get the point across without over doing it or getting in the way of the music. If I read one more review of her ""not looking the part"" I'm gonna explode - see Birgit Nilsson on the cover of her recording with George Solti...did she look like 16 year old sex icon? Did Hildegaard Behrens look 16 years old? Malfitano and Stratas ""look"" the part more but they don't have the warm fluid sound that Mattila has. If you're really that hung up on the production then I'm sorry, but it's more than fine in my opinion.",1520640000,,776,4.358620689655172

8426692,5,B004ECFWAI,Arrived on time. No problem.,1465171200,,28,4.8
8426693,5,B004ECFWAI,"True, Karitta Matilla is a bit old but you need vocal maturity to handle this role and she provides it in spades.  She acts the part very well. You see a 16-year-old in her.  The production is a bit bizarre but I'm willing to overlook that.  The supporting cast is excellent and the orchestra is in top form.  It is well worth viewing over and over.  All in all, a good investment.",1427068800,,381,4.236111111111111
8426694,3,B004ECFWAI,Performance is very good. Karita Mattila is a fine actress but really doesn't look the part and appears too old for role without the the sensual charrm expected of Solome. I hated the production - an obviously Biblical story with references to the living Christ just doesn't jibe in a modern day contemporary setting. Rest of cast sings very well.,1402531200,,347,4.8
8426695,5,B004ECFWAI,"I was lucky to have been there in the Spring of 2004 when  this production was unveiled with Karita Mattila, and remember being mesmerized by it.  Four years later it was revived, and I was lucky for it to have been taped. In both, Mattila is absolutely incandescent, a real force of nature.  On film, I own the Stratas who, of course, is perfect for the role, and I do like the secondary characters better. On record, though many sopranos excel in the last scene (just think of Leontyne Price) my favorite complete recording is Caballe's. Interestingly, I found the NYT reviews for both of Mattila's performances, both by the same reviewer, four years apart, utilizing almost the identical terms.  For those interested in the life and career of this magnificent soprano, search for her on Wikipedia. Juha Usitalo makes for an estentorious if ungainly Jochanaan, but Kim Bagely and Idiko Komlosi are a bit too tame for Herod and Herodias. Joseph Kaiser shows off a lovely voice as Narraboth, and Patrick Summers shines in the pit.",1370649600,6,1030,4.80225988700565
8426696,2,B004ECFWAI,Nice try by a good cast but it just does not come together. Buy the Maria Ewing DVD of Salome instead.,1368230400,,102,3.9047619047619047
8426697,5,B004ECFWAI,"OK so she doesn't look 16 (the age of the character) but she sang a fantastic Salome and her acting was 1st rate.  Next to Nielson, best Salome recorded.",1359504000,2,153,4.275862068965517
8426698,1,B004ECFWAI,"The staging of this opera is ridiculous. The story is set in a party where the guests wear modern suits and dresses and drink prosecco... In the middle of it, an elevator brings Jochanaan, who is dressed like a beggar. Embarrassing, to say the least. When the staging is so bad, it is pointless to discuss the music. A CD would have been much better.
People say that modern stagings are important to bring new audiences to the opera... I think that such a garbage can scare people off. Modern stagings should be creative, not just make fun of the opera.",1320537600,8,553,4.485148514851486
8426699,4,B004ECFWAI,"Karita Mattila is the star in this production! Joseph Kaiser,also, sings and acts well-wish his role was a little larger. Good production.",1311465600,2,138,5.318181818181818
