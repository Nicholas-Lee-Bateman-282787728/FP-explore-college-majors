5726296,5,B00CM0EQC4,This was a birthday gift and it was just as funny as I remembered it. Love Duck Dodgers. That's it.,1378598400,,99,4.0
5726297,5,B00CM0EQC4,"Season two of Duck Dodgers marks another slew of great episodes including my favorite episode of the series, ""The Fudd"".  Other recommended episodes for this season are The Love Duck, I see Duck People, The New Cadet, Castle High(another personal favorite), Samurai Quack, and the epic two parter Of Course You Know, This Means War and Peace.  As with the previous volume this one did not disappoint and was also error free unlike the final series release of Tiny Toon Adventures (vol. 4 which has been fixed by the way).  Here's hoping for a speedy release of the third and final season.",1377388800,,588,4.745098039215686
5726298,5,B00CM0EQC4,We've loved Duck Dodgers since watching it on Boomerang and were so sad when they stopped airing it. We waited and waited for it to come out on DVD. We have both the first and second and waiting for third third now!!,1377216000,,216,4.166666666666667
5726299,5,B00CM0EQC4,"As ""J. Smith's"" review on ""Duck Dodgers: Deep Space Duck Season Two"" echoes
my sentiments entirely, there's nothing that I can add.

However I can say to you...

Resistance is futile (Sorry, Borg!!)  You are compelled to...

1. See my review on ""Duck Dodgers: Dark Side of the Duck - Season 1...""

2. Purchase ""Duck Dodgers: Dark Side of the Duck - Season 1...""

3. (For more of a good thing...) Purchase ""Duck Dodgers: Deep Space Duck Season Two""

4. Enjoy!

You cannot resist...I know I can't!

I rate ""Duck Dodgers: Deep Space Duck Season Two""...Five stars!",1371168000,4,560,4.690721649484536
5726300,5,B00CM0EQC4,"I really enjoyed this animated series that aired on the Cartoon Network years ago. At the time of its initial showing, Duck Dodgers wasn't really treated very well, with CN premiering episodes all over the schedule, which can really hurt a program if the viewers can't find it.

Duck Dodgers is a combination of Chuck Jones classic cartoon short that combined Daffy Duck with the world of fifties sci-fi fantasy, and combines it with recent takes on Star Trek, Star Wars, and even the Six Million Dollar Man.

As a fan of the original cartoon, I must say this series continues the proud tradition as Porky (Eager Young Space Cadet) and Duck Dodgers have it out against the the infamous Marvin the Martian and his newly introduced queen (voiced by Tia Carrera).

The special effects and the spaceship fights are top notch, easily rivaling those of Futurama, and in my opinion even better. For those of you who do pick up these DVD's, check out the space battles and take notes.

I'm looking forward to the second volume of this series, which includes the episode, ""The Fudd,"" a bitter enemy of Duck Dodgers which combines elements of the Star Trek:Next Generation's The Borg and Elmer Fudd. A truly terrifying combination. This tale is so funny that I plan to purchase this DVD just to show a friend this horrifying tale.  Will Duck Dodgers and his Eager Young Space Cadet survive an outer space threat which converts its victims into Elmer Fudd-like beings?

Looking forward to this release and the third and final release of Duck Dodgers.

Sincerely,

JThree

5726317,2,B00CM0EQC4,"I gave the season to my boyfriend as a christmas present, only to find when he later opened the plastic that there was a big cut directly through the cover and the plastic casing itself; not a kind of cut that could be done accidentally, but intentionally with a knife. The cut was covered up by a big white sticker on the plastic wrap so I wouldn't see it before it was opened.",1419465600,4,378,4.191780821917808
5726318,5,B00CM0EQC4,"My favourite episode of ""Duck Dodgers"" is from Season Two. It is the ""Samurai Jack"" parody. It's very funny and well done, up to the parodic standards of the classic WB cartoons. WB has done a good job living up to its standards when instead of trying to reproduce the original cartoons with the original talent, they have stayed true to the recipe of 1) topicality; 2) good writing; 3) good plotting and 4) cheeky but kindly parody and light satire of pop culture and music. They no longer sell sheet-music but they can still do a great job on comedy and parody with just a bit of satiric edge where appropriate. These cartoons can entertain adults as well as younger viewers as, like all good writing and cartooning for children, they operate on several levels so all ages can enjoy them together.",1412726400,,799,4.594405594405594

5726324,5,B00CM0EQC4,"Thanks for putting seasons 1 and 2 out. Unlike the new Looney Toons shows this one stays true to its original form, it has past references and characters from the original spoof and Dodgers is still an idiot.
There are also 2 other seasons so hopefully next year they'll be released so I can complete the collection",1385424000,,315,4.543859649122807
5726325,5,B00CM0EQC4,"The bumbling bird of the future and his porcine pal are back in a brand-new season set of ""Duck Dodgers"" entitled ""Deep Space Duck"".  The new set has 13 spaced-out episodes with Dodgers facing new threats and adventures as well as familiar foes such as:

""Pig Planet"" - In order to keep his troublesome niece and nephews (who sound like a certain ""zany-to-the-max"" trio) under control, the Eager Young Space Cadet tells them an ""Aladdin""-like story where he's the hero of his home planet.
""Pet Peeved"" - Dodgers gets himself an adorable new pet, but cuteness aside, this creature is rather dangerous to keep on the ship.
""K-9 Quarry"" - In this special episode, the Martian Commander and his sidekick K-9 go on a hunting trip unaware that the hunter is about to be the hunted.
""Talent Show A-Go-Go"" - The Martian Queen and Dodgers attempt to impress an empress at her annual talent show.  Dodgers wins after he trades voices with the velvet pipes of singer Tom Jones !  (Fun fact: Mr. Jones also performs the ""Duck Dodgers"" theme song.)
""The Love of a Father"" - Dodgers defrosts what he thinks is a little boy, but Dodgers' new ""son"" turns out to be infamous villain Babyface Moonbeam who plots to destroy Earth and Mars.
""The New Cadet"" - Dodgers' Cadet has been replaced with someone lithe, lovely, slender, shapely, and voiced by Kelly Ripa.  But her intentions for Dodgers are quite dangerous, to say the least.
""The Love Duck"" - Dodgers turns his ship into a pleasure cruise with all the benefits and luxuries.  However, his plans are somehow interrupted by another Martian attack.
""The Fudd"" - The universe is being infected by a fiendish albeit familiar virus and only Dodgers, the Cadet, and the Martian Commander can find the source to stop it.
""I See Duck People"" - Dodgers claims to the Cadet and Dr. I.Q. Hi that he can make contact with the dead and tries to prove it when the ship becomes seemingly haunted.
""Deathmatch Duck"" - When a living crystalline planet tells Dodgers that he must do battle on it, Dodgers attempts to defeat his most fearsome foe yet - Taz !
""Deconstructing Dodgers"" - As the Martian Queen and Dr. I.Q. are waiting in a space airport, they have a conversation about Dodgers via a cheesy clip show.
""Old McDodgers"" - Dodgers gives farming a try, but his well-earned crops are being pilfered by a pair of goofy gophers !
""Diva Delivery"" - Dodgers' new mission involves safely sending an interstellar pop star (voice of Macy Gray) to a festival.  And while her demands are quite demanding to Dodgers, he must also protect her from the savage Klunkins.
""Castle High"" - Dr. I.Q. Hi trusts Dodgers to look after his ancestral castle while he's away, and before the good doctor knows it, the place gets destroyed !
""Surf the Stars"" - Dodgers competes in a ""King of the Beach"" surfing contest and gets help from special guest Brian Wilson.
""Samurai Quack"" - After eating some badly prepared sushi, Dodgers dreams he's a wandering samurai on a never-ending quest to defeat the most unspeakable evil...  Wait a minute, does this sound... familiar ?  One hint: Special guest Genndy Tartakofsky !

Yep, this is quite a visually stunning animated series freely based on a Looney Tune classic.  And it is with its gorgeous graphics, the amazing outer space action, and babelicious eye candy (The Martian Queen and The New Cadet, to name a couple).  So this series as seen on the Cartoon Network is great and I hope the third and final season is on the way real soon.  Just take note that ""If he's our future, we're history.""",1384214400,,3547,4.674157303370786
5726326,5,B00CM0EQC4,"I have been a classic Warner Bros cartoon fan for many years, going back to the 1950s; tells you how old I am.  I can remember seeing a classic
cartoon called Rabbit Hood in the late 1940s, one of chuck Jones best. Anyway I have reviewed some of the toons on this disc but not all because
I have seen them all many times.  I was waiting for ever for WB to release these for viewers like myself: I love classic line drawn animation with
the classic characters that today are as funny as they were in the 1940s.  Today much of the television and theatrical animation is computer drawn;
some good such as Shrek and Polar Express, others stink.  This is a return to classic drawings though some is done overseas; better than not having
any at all.  I feared the studio would bring back the nasty Daffy of the mid to late 1950s but no, they returned more or less to the wacky Duck and
his pig friend.  These cartoons for the most part are very funny, have some adult style humor in them (which I like) and have a broad appeal in my
opinion.  There are a few duds but for the 99 percent they are great.  Much satire poking fun at star trek, star wars and other classic shows.  I
of course purchased the first two seasons from AMAZON where I get ALL my DVDs. Video is excellent.  Occasionally other characters make cameo appearances such as Elmer Fudd, voiced by no other than the voice of Billy West the voice of Fry on Futurama.  At least I am pretty sure he is. West
is a terrific voice man as good as any I heard.  Also a sort of Klingon style of Yosemite Sam makes an appearance.  There also is a satire of the
Iron Giant in one of the seasons, the best theatrical animated film I ever saw of the classic mode.  If you like classic style of animation along
with old style Daffy humor with some current updates, you should enjoy these cartoons along with any kids you might have.  Enjoy!",1383955200,3,1884,4.252808988764045
5726327,5,B00CM0EQC4,"In my opinion, Duck Dodgers was a great cartoon that ended too soon. Maybe there is a chance that more episodes will be made one day as cartoons today sometimes do return.

The episode Pig Planet centers around Cadet telling his niece and nephews a story to keep them entertained and to prevent them from destroying the ship and angering Duck Dodgers any further. The Cadets niece and nephews are voiced by Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell, and Tress MacNeille in which they used their Yakko, Wakko, and Dot voices (Animaniacs) respectively as a tribute.",1381536000,4,547,4.819148936170213
