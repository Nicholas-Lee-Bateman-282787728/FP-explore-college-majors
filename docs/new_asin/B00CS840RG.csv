In the chronology of the show it is Series I-VIII then Back to Earth followed by X, XI, and XII.  Just thought that would help potential buyers that didn't realize that.",1518912000,,319,4.19672131147541
8625610,1,B00CS840RG,"I received Back to Earth in Spanish, NOT season  IX.  I already have Back to Earth, which takes place after season X, in English, which is what I speak. So Obviously I do not need another version in a language I do not speak.  I was trying to get an earlier season that I do not yet have, and can't manage to get it.  Instead, bot times, I got a version of Back to Earth, which is 2 season later.",1487635200,,396,3.9125
