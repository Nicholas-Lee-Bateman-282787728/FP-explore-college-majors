Both of them seemed to be throwing away something promising (for her, nursing; for him, the military or its veterans' benefits).  I think many Americans will relate to Ricky and his family, as many veterans are returning from the recent war damaged emotionally.  However, it's Andrea's story that has my mental wheels spinning.

First off, Andrea is a Canadian woman who looks a bit like fellow Canadian Alanis Morrissette.  She actually reminds me of some folk with whom I attended high school, very girl next door.  She lives in Canada.  The doc shows her people speaking with those unique O's and O-U's.  There's snow everywhere too.  Even having a biracial Asian brother added flavor to her story, but his background is never discussed.  (Also, she has an older brother who could go into modeling.  Folk who like men are just going to love, love, love him.)

She has three ""complex"" relationships with men.  A senior citizen has been giving her gifts and money for years.  He even paid for a car and college for her.  Later, she performs rated-R acts with him to get money.  Child abuse literature calls it grooming when the abuser uses things and niceness to get close to the victim and deceive the victim's family.  This older man had the longest grooming period of which I've ever heard.  Many will ask, ""Why didn't her parents see this coming?!""  But there's also the issue of ""If he did nothing physical until after she was 21, then it can't be deemed child abuse, can it!?""  Both Andrea and the older man conflate father-daughter terms with husband-wife terms.  The older man speaks of love.  While most will condemn him, Andrea said herself that she has been using him for money.  I think anti-violence advocates would have a lot to say about what was displayed here.

Andrea speaks to an incarcerated inmate about 10 times a day.  Her mother complained that it cost $116 per month.  Well, south of the Canadian border, it cost much more than that!  Trust me when I say speaking with inmates is expensive in the US!  Andrea also visits a hotel where she takes drugs with an ex-boyfriend.  They silence the dialogue when I think she is referring to lollipop-licking.  While Andrea gives thought to her interactions with the older man, she never speaks of the shady relations between herself and the other men.  Luckily, a counselor finally brings up Andrea's perverted man issues.

Many Intervention episodes show addicted people resisting the request for help.  Andrea's scene was quite the opposite.  I assume many of us viewers would like to see Andrea finish her nursing degree.  However, if her drug (ab)use is documented, then the nursing board in her province might forbid it.

For anyone who is concerned about ""good girls who go bad,"" then this is a must-see episode.  For any lover of men who has asked herself or himself, ""Why am I dealing with that guy!?"", this will also be important viewing to chew on.",1295136000,,3101,4.7593984962406015
