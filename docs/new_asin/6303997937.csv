As a personal trainer, I'm always telling my clients they have to start slowly & work their way from there. This vhs truely helps a person do just that!",1385856000,,252,4.270833333333333
7859316,1,6303997937,"The set sounds like a great idea, but its execution has been badly chosen, editted and packaged.  There are three tapes (Cardio (Mon/Wed/Fri), Strength (Tu/Th) and Stretching (Sa/Su)) and all are editted segments from her various TV shows.  In and of itself, that's not so bad, but the segments chosen are among the absolute worst she's ever done.
The cardio tape is unwatchable.  Warm up isn't too bad, but she forgets to stretch the right calf.  There's a country music segment that's horrible.  She gives vague instructions, none of which match her work on the floor. the camera rarely pans to her feet and never does so when it might actually be helpful.  Then the last segment is from her ""Funk Aerobic"" period and it's AWFUL.  She looks like she's having a seizure.
the strength tape is 100 times better, but given the low score of the Cardio, 100 times still isn't a very high number.  It's not the worst thing she's ever done...and at least you can actually DO the exercise as she both describes and demonstrates it.  But it's awkwardly editted from the TV shows, which is obvious by references she makes to what's coming up and what just happened.
I haven't even bothered to open the Stretching video--given the questionable quality of the first two videos, it seemed a pointless venture to say the least.  I actively discourage anyone from purchasing this set, unless you can find it at a garage sale ... and then you ought to at least rethink the idea.",999302400,15,1463,4.6796875
