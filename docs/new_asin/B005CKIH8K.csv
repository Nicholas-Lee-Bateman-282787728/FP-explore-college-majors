4707151,4,B005CKIH8K,I liked seeing Elvis and Frank  sing together. Some parts might seem silly today but overall it worth watching. Viewers also get to see 1960 Timex comercials.,1387324800,,158,4.851851851851852
4707152,3,B005CKIH8K,Not enough Elvis and too much Timex. Should have been much better even for the 60's. Just watch a film with highlight clips from the show: This is Elvis or many others.,1378425600,,168,4.28125
4707153,4,B005CKIH8K,"I really liked Elvis's performances in this episode. The only problem is that the film is pretty bad, but not so bad you can't see what anyone is doing.",1376956800,,152,4.275862068965517
4707154,3,B005CKIH8K,"Absolutely amazing to see how bad early television really was.  The only significance of this show is that it was filmed shortly after Elvis demilitarized.  Other than that, it is not too good and the recording itself is terrible.",1376524800,,230,4.871794871794871
4707155,3,B005CKIH8K,Good video! Interesting piece of filmed history. Great to see Frank and his daughter working together. Elvis coming back to show business...especial moment!,1374451200,,156,5.826086956521739
4707156,1,B005CKIH8K,Realize that this was early TV but horrible picture quality. Would not recommend. Rent early movies or just grab a good CD,1371081600,,122,4.590909090909091
4707157,3,B005CKIH8K,The quality of the audio & video are very poor. With today's technology I would have thought it would be better.,1364169600,,112,4.380952380952381
4707158,5,B005CKIH8K,"This is Elvis at his greatest!  Back from the Army and chomping at the bit to get going again with his singing and acting careers!  He introduced his latest single, ""Stuck on You"" and flip side, ""Fame and Fortune.""  So fantastic!  And his duet with Frank Sinatra is historical.  This is a must to have and I'm so delighted with my purchase.  I watch it on my Kindle Fire and it's just a touch away from being highly entertained whenever you need that Elvis fix!",1344556800,,461,4.364705882352941
4707159,5,B005CKIH8K,"I really enjoyed the Elvis and Frank duets. If technically possible, it would be great if the two estates agreed to blue ray the video.",1454544000,,135,4.44
4707160,3,B005CKIH8K,"The quality is not very good, but it's a great show.",1446508800,,52,3.8181818181818183
4707161,5,B005CKIH8K,"This was a great moment in history to watch. Since it is old, the  visual quality is poor but it's a masterpiece none the less.",1444176000,,127,4.08
4707162,1,B005CKIH8K,"Even being a ""child of the 50s"" did not help me appreciate this mess. Corny, extremely poor quality grainy video and scratchy sound. Glad I did not know what I was missing then.",1441670400,,177,4.393939393939394

4707164,4,B005CKIH8K,Enjoyed seeing these two icons together. A young Nancy Sinatra with her dad.,1432944000,,76,4.923076923076923

4707166,1,B005CKIH8K,"Only for hard-core buffs of early, grainy black & white television shows. In these days of remastered oldies, this combination of two giants of music leaves a lot to be desired.",1430265600,,177,4.741935483870968

4707169,5,B005CKIH8K,"Sinatra at his best, even when admitting he was wrong about Elvis. He showed true class and respect for the men and woman of the Armed Forces.",1425945600,,142,4.296296296296297
4707170,1,B005CKIH8K,Thoughat that Elvis would be singing. After about 15 minutes I shut it off.,1425772800,,75,4.428571428571429
4707171,5,B005CKIH8K,Too bad the quality isn't better. We still will watch these old shows no matter what.,1425513600,,85,4.375
4707172,1,B005CKIH8K,totally bad sound and video and the 1950's TV shows were horable. Music chosen was poorly produces and presented with a minimum of background and musical support. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME EVEN FOR FREE PRIME TIME VIEWING,1417910400,,215,4.837837837837838

4707177,4,B005CKIH8K,Not enough Elvis,1404345600,,16,4.666666666666667
4707178,2,B005CKIH8K,"It was interesting to see Elvis, though he didn't appear until the end of the show, which was 99% about Frank, with some inane sketch with his two buddies, which wasn't very good. I didn't remember the Frank Sinatra show, and I'm glad I didn't.",1393113600,,244,4.444444444444445
8473960,1,B005CKIH8K,Awful singing except for Elvis. The Chairman of the Board should spin in his grave that this is out there of him.,1481932800,,113,4.181818181818182
8473961,4,B005CKIH8K,"Great fo my Dad who is in a nursing home with dementia. He can't watch anything for more than a few seconds, but he watched this for a full half hour - mesmerized.",1470787200,,163,3.9696969696969697
8473962,4,B005CKIH8K,It was obvious Frank Sinatra did not like sharing a stage with Elvis,1469836800,,68,4.3076923076923075
8473963,5,B005CKIH8K,"Watching this silvery old print of a Sinatra TV show makes me remember nights in front of the television set. Sitting on the floor, cross-legged, with my brother. It reminds me that the person who HAD to introduce us to Elvis was our babysitter. Then there was old Blue Eyes, just in case you forgot who had the ring-a-ding-ding. Did these guys ever feel like themselves without a scotch on the rocks and a cigarette? Into that mix comes Elvis - country and all youth and testosterone, without SIDEBURNS!

The girls in the audience screamed and shrieked to see him. So would I have, had I not been sitting there in the dark, watching those images on the tv screen. What a trip.",1468454400,,677,4.504065040650406

8473968,3,B005CKIH8K,"Watching Elvis snap his fingers on the wrong beats and mangle ""Witchcraft"" was pretty painful",1458000000,,93,5.266666666666667
8473969,2,B005CKIH8K,"Perhaps just a sign of earlier times.  I found this very boring.  Elvis had little spotlight, until the end.",1455235200,,108,4.631578947368421
