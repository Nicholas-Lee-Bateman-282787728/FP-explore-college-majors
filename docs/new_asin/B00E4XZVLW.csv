8601263,3,B00E4XZVLW,"I grew up fishing in Cook Inlet. I've had my own boat and fished in the group as the guys featured in the show. And let me tell you- NG edited the crud out of this show! They also misrepresented the prices per pound- and the fishing periods. They lead you to believe that you watched a season of fishing. You didn't. They grabbed some footage from one day and shoved it in from footage on another day. An called it a ""period"". No... Then they ""chose"" a last day. That wasn't the last day! Just the last day they chose to show. A gross misrepresentation of a truly awesome and hard working fishery!!! They did capture some cool fishing footage. But they didn't even tell you that Bonnie was Wes's wife. Sheesh! That's cool. She's been out there for years. But instead they tell you she's a ""senior citizen deckhand"". Nice. Not! I love this fishery. Too bad they didn't show you how great it really is.",1389225600,3,900,4.363095238095238
