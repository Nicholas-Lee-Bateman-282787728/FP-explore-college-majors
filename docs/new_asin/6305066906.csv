956429,5,6305066906,"""Three Came Home"" is the true story of Agnes Newton Keith's experiences during World War Two. Based on her autobiography, this moving yet surprisingly brutal (especially for 1950) war film has somehow remained largely forgotten over the years. With top-notch performances, especially from Claudette Colbert and Sessue Hayakawa, this a definite must for any fan of classic movies.

Claudette Colbert stars as Agnes Keith, a writer who lives in British North Borneo in 1940-41 with her husband (Patric Knowles) and little boy. They are part of a small community of British civilians (Colbert is the only American among them) living in the region, and life is good for them, until they hear of the Dec. 7, 1941 surprise attack by Japanese forces on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor. It's then only a matter of weeks until the Japanese troops land in Borneo. When they do land, Mrs. Keith and all the other civilians are quickly rounded up and ""introduced"" to their new ""masters"". On May 12, 1942, Agnes and her husband are seperated as they're sent to different prison camps. She has her young son with her, and they struggle to survive in their new harsh environment.

However, Agnes meets the prison camp commander, Col. Suga (Sessue Hayakawa), who's amazingly a fan of hers because of her famous novels, and slowly they become friends. But that friendship doesn't prevent her from being assaulted one night by a camp guard or from taking a brutal beating during a relentless interrogation by a different officer. But Col. Suga does his best to keep Agnes and her son safe, even after his own family is wiped out by the atomic bomb at Hiroshima. The ending would initially seem like typical Hollywood propaganda if you didn't know this was a true story, and the fact that it's true makes it even more amazing. The violence in the movie is very rare for a 1950 film, with women being shown abused by prison guards, including the attempted rape of Agnes. Perhaps the toughest scene to watch is the one showing Australian prisoners being machine-gunned as they try to climb a barbed wire fence, not to try and escape, but simply to talk to female prisoners!

This bargain priced dvd from Front Row Entertainment has a remarkably clear picture quality and a fabulous sound quality, and at this inexpensive price you can't ask for more than that! This is an incredible true story of survival amid the heartless carnage of World War Two, and it's one of the finest performances of Claudette Colbert. Highly recommended.",1113350400,22,2515,4.830626450116009

956431,5,6305066906,"I had never even heard of Three Came Home until I ran across it in a catalog.  The description sounded interesting enough to get me to buy it, and I'm glad I did.  Three Came Home is a riveting and moving film that grabs the viewer and never lets go.  Focusing on what happened to many civilians in the Pacific the film covers a 4 year period from 1941 to 1945, and it shows what kind of hardships and trials many people had to endure in prison camps during the war, primarily focusing on womens camps.  Claudette Colbert gives a fantastic performance, and Sessue Hayakawa is outstanding as the Colonel in charge of the prison camps.  The script is intelligent and filled with great dialogue, and the acting is first rate throughout.  The Alpha DVD is quite good - the print is VERY clean for a ""bargain"" (public domain) copy, and you should have no concerns as to the quality of this DVD.  Highly recommended.",1076198400,99,910,4.4787878787878785
956432,5,6305066906,"One of the best World War Two era dramas ever. The fact that I had never heard of this movie is a testament to it's being under-rated. It's usually not shown in retrospectives of war movies, not enough testosterone displayed, I presume, which is a shame, as it is a powerful take on the ""human"" side of war, and the effects on the individual. Claudette Colbert,  whose only starring role I was familiar with was in ""It Happened One Night"", is wonderfully touching and noble in this true- story based drama of an author forcefully seperated from her husband and placed, with her little boy, in a Japanese prison camp. As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I like strong womens roles, the good ones of which are few and far between. This is one of the best. Her portrayal is one of pathos, bravery, and perseverence in the face of overwhelming, spirit- breaking odds. This film also offers a rare for that time somewhat sympathetic view of the Japanese,  in the role of Sessue Hayakawas' Japanese officer who, over time, developes a true respect for Colberts character that transcends gender and war time prejudices, and, shows the human loss on both sides. This film says just as much about the tragedy of war, maybe more so, than any battle scenes. I am not generally a fan of many war movies, how many battle scenes can you watch??, but I was totally drawn in when I happened upon this film by accident on the History Channel. I was so impressed by it that I bought the video, after trying to track it down for some time. A wonderfully moving drama, yes, it is a ""tear-jerker"", but much more than that, it is also ultimatley uplifting. A classic movie, very radical for it's time, it's a must have for any film buff, or anyone who wants to see what true movie making WAS.",1022544000,131,1772,4.5
956433,4,6305066906,"Claudette Colbert gives a very strong performance as real life writer  Agnes Keith, an American woman living on Borneo with her British husband  and son during WWII.  When the Japanese invade, she and her son are  separated from her husband, Patric Knowles, and all are imprisoned in  camps.  A Japanese colonel, very well played by Sessue Hayakawa, takes an  interest in Colbert since he has read her book, and they have a platonic  relationship that is one of the most interesting features of the movie.  He  has been educated in America, and he reveals more about himself than a  typical Japanese soldier would.  Three Came Home illustrates the poor  conditions of prison camps during WWII and the effect of the war on those  who weren't soldiers but had to fight to survive. It's a dramatic story,  well acted, and worth viewing.",968457600,55,833,4.808510638297872

956738,5,6305066906,"Agnes Keith's tremendous story of the cruelties and horror experienced during her three years of confinement in a Japanese prison camp is one of the best and most moving true stories I have ever watched on film.
This film conveys the stark brutality of the arrogant Japanese when they swept through the East Indian islands during the early months of the war, rounding up non-combatants and impressing them in filthy prison camps. Mrs. Keiths apt descriptions of the horror of prisoner life is very frank and descriptive.
This film demonstrates a woman's fortitude, tenacity and love to keep herself and her child alive. And it is through the intense dramatic episodes of this woman's three-year struggle in prison camps, with other women of equal fortitude around her, that the strength of the human spirit is revealed.
This film will shock you, disturb you, and tear your heart out. But it will fill you fully with a great respect for the wonderful and heroic soul found in Mrs. Agnes Keith.",1473206400,,992,4.875739644970414

The film also leaves out a lot of detail (OK, they only had 94 minutes to tell the story) but I missed the descriptions of the nuns and their significant roll in the story.

It is not 2-dimensional at all. I feel this movie gives superb insight into how both prisoner and prison-keeper suffer conflict and discover compassion during this horrible time in our history. (I don't think very young children should see this film as it does portray some scenes of violence that, while by no means as graphic or explicit as today's modern films, are still jarring and could be upsetting.)",1427155200,2,751,4.875

957062,4,6305066906,"Based on true events, this film adaptation represents a horrendous moment in time for many countries. How one could adjust to such an impoverished environment and unimaginable treatment over many years is one of legend. With such a strong storyline that exemplifies the mothers and children who survived this ordeal, who could envision having the mental clarity and sense of impartiality to write a book on her experience.

I have not read Mrs. Keith's book but other reviewers consider this film a fair treatment. With very limited experience of the depth of deprivation, hunger, and humiliation, I can only assume this film highlighted a partial view of actual emotions. With extensive controversy surrounding the war, each opposing side cites propaganda motives at every turn. Mrs. Keith being well-educated and an author of some notoriety, it is hard to believe her account is not valid.

I found this film to be extremely educational, inspirational and heartwarming. My only Hollywood type comment is: Why did the crippled POW men have to WALK to the women's camp when all the able bodied were hootin' n hollerin' with joy in the open air trucks. Made no sense, but of course it did make the ""Three Came Home"" theme closer to home.",1408406400,,1236,4.966183574879227

(If you have not ever watched it, I highly recommend spending a great night in and enjoy a lot of laughs and amazing timing and acting from all involved in this great old film - it truly stands the test of time when it comes to comedy and superior writing and acting) Now this movie on the other hand was terrible.  I still can not figure out how the acting from Ms Colbert could be so far off the mark.  She was awful, as well as most of the entire cast.  The dialogue was downright silly and i really did not care one way or the other for the characters in this film as they were so forced and obviously acting.  Even the scenery was cheap and false.  The only redeeming moments in this film (and reason for two rather than one star) were the scenes involving the actor who played the Japanese General (?) who was in charge of the womans POW camp.  If anything kept me watching this film it was his performance.  He made me feel for his loss and seemed to be invested in his role in this movie.  I was most disappointed and am somewhat angry i wasted my time sitting through this entire film.  We all like different things and i always find writing a review of a movie or song is difficult but im pretty sure im right about this one.  To see Claudette Colbert in It Happened One Night and then see her in this movie was strange for me.  I guess i never thought she had made a bad movie.  My suggestion is to watch her and Clark Gable in the aforementioned movie and have yourself a great night with a great movie, still as wonderful and witty today as it was so many years ago.

957153,5,6305066906,"I first saw this film years ago on television -- well before DVDs or VHS.

Based on a book -- true story -- by Agnes Newton Keith, it details her internment in a Japanese prison camp during WWII in Borneo.

It is a startlingly moving story of survival of a group of women and children -- some of the women in their 70s -- and how badly they were treated by their prison guards and the commandant of the camp.  The film follows the book very closely.  Mrs. Keith told it like it was, even including the fact that some of the other women in the camp thought she was too ""chummy"" with the commandant who gave her special favors due to the fact that he had read one of her books in the past and admired her writing.

Most WWII films focus on the men involved in the war.  It is worth the time to learn how some women fared during WWII.

Watch this film, and then read some of Mrs. Keith's books.  She was a remarkable woman, six feet tall, overcame a serious head injury early in her life, lost her eyesight for a long period, did bit parts in movies, married an Englishman, lived in Borneo for five years before the war, kept her son live during their imprisonment, and flourished after the family's liberation.  Luckily, her husband survived his imprisonment, too.

You won't be disappointed in this film.",1378684800,3,1303,4.347107438016529
957154,5,6305066906,Claudette Colbert's movies are always wonderful to watch and well acted.  This movie is another great fine.  I recommend this to old movie buffs.,1378339200,2,145,5.0
957155,5,6305066906,"I was very impressed by Agnes Keith's book ""Three came home"" - and I was delighted by this faithful adaptation of her war time memories.

1. The real Agnes Keith

The real Agnes Keith was born Agnes Newton in 1901 in Oak Park, Illinois. Later her family moved to California and she studied at Berkeley. After graduation she became a journalist at ""San Francisco Examiner"" - but her career was interrupted after only eight months by a shocking development. A crazy man, who believed that the press persecuted him by printing cartoons tried to kill her and left her for dead. It took her two years to fully recover.

After making some modelling and playing small roles in movies, in 1934 she married Henry (""Harry"") G. Keith, an Englishman who was since a long time a friend of her brother. Soon after their marriage, Mr and Mrs Keith left for Borneo, where he was working since already ten years. They were to live there until 1952, with just an interruption in 1945-46 - it was also there that their son George was born. After 1952 they lived and worked in Philippines and Libya before retiring to British Columbia in Canada, where they lived until the end of their days. Agnes Keith died in 1982 - her husband died before the end of the same year.

2. The book ""Three came home""

Agnes Keith published seven books in all during her life, beginning with ""Land Below the Wind"" in 1939 in which she described her life in British colony of Sandakan in Borneo since 1934. It went to be quite widely known in pre-war Asia, but it was her second book, ""Three came home"", published in 1947 that became a bestseller and is definitely her most important publication.

""Three came home"" describes the period of Japanese occupation of Borneo between beginning of 1942 and September 1945. During most of this time Agnes Keith and her infant son George stayed in a Japanese concentration camp - her husband was held in another concentration camp, together with allied POWs and other civilian imprisoned by occupying forces.

The description of those three and a half years is very realistic, very poignant - but in the same time full of wit, spirit and without any hatred towards the Japanese gaolers, albeit there is some occasional disgust with one particularly despicable officer. This is the story of a woman who was mistreated, abused, beaten, starved and humilitated for 30 months, all this when doing heavy manual labor and having to take care of an infant - and all this without ever giving up, without losing hope and faith and certainly without ever losing her humanity. She was quite a lady...

3. The adaptation

From the moment the book was published it was certain that Hollywood will adapt it on the screen. Initially Olivia de Havilland was supposed to play the main role, but ultimately producers gave it to Claudette Colbert, who was 13 years older (she was 47 when playing in this film) - and I think this was an excellent choice!

Colbert, who was very sensitive about her age and was not maternal at all (she never had children), initially was less than thrilled at the idea of playing a woman aged 40 at the beginning of the story and caring mother of a little child - but after everything was wrapped up, she profusely thanked the director and to the end of her days considered this film as one of her best. Sadly, when making this film she suffered a back injury - and she never fully recovered from it. She had more and more difficulty working long hours. She made only three more films in Hollywood, before leaving for Europe in 1952, where she made only five more films before definitely retiring in 1961.

In this film she appears in virtually every scene and she is simply impressive! For its time this film was considered pretty shocking as there is a very brutal scene of beating and torture of a woman by Japanese soldiers, another scene in which a woman is brutally attacked by a soldier clearly intending to rape her, etc. etc. By sheer contrast with the rest of the film, those scenes are in fact quite shocking - even if obviously we saw much, much worse on the screen already...

There are some differences with the book - there is a little less humour and also the great role played by the nuns (very important in the book) in caring for other women during their time in concentration camps is somehow lesser. But mostly this is a faithful adaptation.

So all in all, this film is in the same time highly interesting, very touching and very beautiful - and if you like it, try to read the book - it is even better!",1378166400,,4539,4.575123152709359

957211,3,6305066906,"I think if they wanted to make a film showing the effects of years of slavery and deprivation in this internment camp, they could have tried to make all the residents of the camp look a little less like they had just stepped off the pages of a magazine. The crisp white shirts of women and children remained pristine, even in the muddy jungle. All women's hair was neatly washed and styled, at all times, not a hair out of place, and skin was scrubbed and shining at all times. Clothing for women and children was clean and new looking, even after five years. No one even looked like they had even missed a meal. I know this was made back in the day, but that is really having to suspend disbelief.

I too was afraid for the children when the commander took them to his home. I understand that he was grieving for his children, even monsters can love their own children, but naturally, in his blinding arrogance, he felt that the loss of his children was more important than all the children in all the occupied island nations whose lives they had threatened or taken. I didn't feel for him.

I think Paradise Road did a better job at depicting the effects of imprisonment on the civilian women and children, and also at showing the best and worst of people.",1372723200,2,1258,4.418103448275862

I'm happy to report that 20th Century Fox chose a very good print or negative with rich black & white contrast for this DVD-R transfer (despite a few night scenes being a bit too dark, they certainly don't detract from the overall quality).

This is one of Claudette Colbert's best pictures and one of her best performances.  Because it was released in 1950, a year of especially great movies (Sunset Blvd., Born Yesterday and Oscar winner All About Eve) and great female performances (Gloria Swanson, Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, and Oscar winner Judy Holliday), neither she nor the movie received an Oscar nod.  In any other year, Colbert would have been nominated.  But that's no reason why Sessue Hayakawa should not have received a supporting Oscar nod for his heartbreaking performance as the Japanese commander in charge of the women's prisoner-of-war camp during World War 2.

It is an outstanding film and Claudette Colbert, as Agnes Newton Keith, is a mild celebrity in the work camps since her books are known by the overall commandant for all the camps in the area. The family, with other British citizens, are captured in North Boreno, and eventually separated into work camps. Not as colorful as Empire but the harshness of camp life, limited food, working under harsh conditions, battling malaria and begging for quinine, and facing harsh discipline all is very realistic. Survival is portrayed as a daily quest and the harshness of treatment for the women appears no different from the men although less brutal. In virtually every scene, survival is in doubt. The complete cast is excellent for both those playing British, Australian and Japanese.",1358035200,2,915,4.9869281045751634
957264,3,6305066906,"VCI (under its various monikers) is generally a reliable restorer/distributor of classic films in the public domain, and I own a great number of DVDs from their catalog. After comparing VCI's print of 'Three Came Home'-- a very good Jean Negulesco-directed wartime drama (4 stars)-- side-by-side with the cleanest version I've been able to track down over the years (Front Row Entertainment's 2001 release), however, I'm disappointed to report that the former's, on balance, is inferior. While the 2012 'Nostalgia Film Factory' transfer is arguably less marred by age-related artifacts (specks, scratches, etc.) and at times appears to have the sharper picture of the two (with fewer audio anomalies), this advantage is negated by serious contrast problems which render some scenes so dark nearly all peripheral-- and occasionally central-- detail is obscured in blackness. If you haven't got a copy of this fine film, I wouldn't discount VCI's as a passable-quality print for the price. But if you own TCH on DVD already, don't expect this latest offering to be an upgrade.

It was too bad her film careeer did not go on much longer past this point,as tv cut into the number of films being made and the type of film being made,and many of the older stars saw themselves squeezed out and usually went to television. Claudette was one of these and undeservedly so..but here she's cast as american writer in japanese occupied asia throughout the war,based on a novel and its interesting,and her performance is heartfelt and she occupies our interest throughout,especially as the war lingers out and supply shortages and conditions at pow camps are squeezed. The film depicts the suffering she fared with the other woman she was housed with and details her relations with husband and child(also at the camp).
It is based on true story,and one of the highlights of film is beginning when japanese camp commander who is sympathetic,recalls her from the states and her views of oriental culture at the time. This is the basis for his relationship
and contact with her,one of the interesting parts of the film. The film also tells of her attempt to meet husband whoose absence gnaws at her being,and husband and wife are absorbed with each other...then goes into sequence of sexual assault of military officer and her not wanting to sign false confession statement.

957267,5,6305066906,"""Three Came Home"" is a moving film about the indomitable nature of the human spirit.  American author Agnes Newton Keith (Claudette Colbert) lived on the island of Borneo at the beginning of World War II.  As the Japanese neared the island, she refused to be evacuated along with other wives, preferring to stay with her husband.

When the Japanese invaded, the men and women were sent to separate concentration camps.  Keith, along with her young son, endured several years of imprisonment, hunger, degradation and violence, yet emerged with her spirit unbroken.

Colbert gives a powerful performance as does Sessue Hayakawa, playing a cultured, sympathetic Japanese officer.  The other performers, especially the actresses playing Keith's fellow prisoners, are also fine.

upon viewing the film, i was shocked at how revealing the attire worn by Colbert was in parts of the film. the clothes worn were relevant to the setting and situation of the story, but for 1950 i deemed it very arousing though i'm sure this was unintentional. very little imagination was necessary for one to virtually envision miss Colbert naked.

957331,4,6305066906,"Based on a true story, a memoir written by American Agnes Keith of the years she,her young son and British husband spent in Japanese POW camps in Indonesia, the film though restrained in the way of its time, is still very powerful about the brutality that soldiers display during war, even toward civilians.  The bad guys in this film are of course the Japanese, but we've all learned since then that soldiers from all countries can at times behave abominally.

The camera discreetly turns away at some scenes of physical torment.  The camp commander played by Sessue Hayakawa, is a tough soldier but a complex character with facets of humanity and even grief.  The lead character and her husband have a physically passionate relationship, and there is even a suggestion of a clandestine conjugal tryst in the jungle.

My criticism is primarily about cosmetics, literally.  For a woman and her son, and their fellow captives who spent three years or more in appalling conditions, Claudette Colbert et al looked incredibly healthy and well-groomed at the end.  Starvation and beatings were frequent, but barely a hair fell out of place, and after the captivity she looked pretty much the same as before-wearing salvaged clothes that fit beautifully.

Still, the tensions, the unfairness, the fear, the dirt, labor, and disease, loss of family time, and even the physical passions, approach authenticity, which was especially rare in film in 1950.  The DVD version I watched had no special feature--the film is in black and white.  The story was so moving that I ordered a copy of the book from Amazon UK.

957337,3,6305066906,"It's 1940 and we're in the town of Sandakan, Borneo.  War is raging in the Far East, but as yet Borneo's fields are unsullied by the boots of foreign invaders.  Sandakan is the home of author Agnes Keith, her British civilian worker husband, and their 4-year-old son.  Soon a radio will announce the attack on Pearl Harbor and everything will change.  THREE CAME HOME (1950) is one of the oddest movies I've seen in a while.  Besides spoiling its ending with its titles, it's that rarity or rarities, a war movie told from a woman's point of view.

  Soon after war is declared the Japanese invade Borneo.  In May 1942 all Europeans are ordered to go to prison camps - one for the men, one for the women and children. Agnes (Claudette Colbert) and son go off to one camp, husband Harry (Patric Knowles) goes off to another.  From this point on the movie pretty much drops Harry from the narrative.  Although Agnes pines for him daily, he's little more to us than a pair of shoulders and a cookie duster moustache memory whose sole purpose was to adore Agnes, deeply and unequivocally.

  The first clue we get that we aren't in Kansas anymore, war moviewise, is when a Japanese subaltern tells a roomful of woman that they must bow when a Japanese officer enters a room.  The women proceed to do so with nary a snarl or murmur, and continue to do so unfailingly and uncomplainingly throughout the movie.  That would never happen in a John Wayne movie.  A little more surprising is the movie's treatment of the Japanese soldiers.  Although one or two are stereotypically wicked, there's a surprising range of types for a movie made so soon after the war.  In fact, the most complex and sympathetic character is Colonel Suga, wonderfully played by Sessue Hayakawa, who admires Agnes Keith's books and develops something of a protective friendship with her.

  Some bad things happen to Agnes in the third act.  I almost wrote `finally happen'.  Until the last act this movie seemed to be pulling its punches.  The forced separation of the Keith family is presented as an unfortunate event, rations in the prison camp are scare, and vital medical attention - quinine for the malarial patients, for example - are sporadically administered.  Yet....

  Something's amiss.  Suga's solicitude toward Agnes and his oft exhibited paternal affection for her young son rang false - or, perhaps more accurately, incomplete.  The movie didn't make me believe that after Agnes had practically been bent into a human pretzel by camp thugs (without Suga's knowledge, I hasten to add), after her family had been forcibly separated, her husband possibly to probably killed in a Japanese prison camp... after all that she could calmly sit to tea with Colonel Suga and provide genuine sympathy when he learns that his family has suffered a severe, war related tragedy.  Either the movie, and perhaps the book it was based on, omitted information that would explain the true depth of the relationship between Agnes and Suga, or Agnes was indeed the near-saint the movie presents her as, someone who could ignore her losses and suffering to provide comfort to her captor when he suffers his loss.

  Although THREE CAME HOME didn't convince me, I enjoyed it.  As usual Colbert is strong, but the movie belongs to Sessue Hayakawa as the complex Japanese officer.",1119225600,3,3339,4.816901408450704
