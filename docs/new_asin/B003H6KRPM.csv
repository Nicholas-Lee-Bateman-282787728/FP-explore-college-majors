8396762,3,B003H6KRPM,"If you are a spy drama fan and like cyborg super-spies, you should enjoy this anime. If you are looking for more sci-fi like anime, pass on it. The story line was good, but it's not really my style, so I've already given it away. (I'm not a Bond fan either). I won't spoil it any further.",1358121600,,288,4.0701754385964914
8396763,5,B003H6KRPM,"I would say that I don't feel like repeating anything other reviewers have said, but after reading there is one thing.  THIS IS NOT PORN!  It's a television show.

A few other things I'd like to point out:

I recommend this show for anyone who likes old anime.  The pacing, the themes, and particularly the ending are suited to that taste.

The music is by Iwasaki Taku, and it's somewhere between his scores for R.O.D TV and Witch Hunter Robin.

While they refer to her as ""nine one"", 009-1 can be read as ""Zero Zero Kunoichi"".  (In fact, that was the title of a certain comic...)",1338940800,,581,4.415094339622642
8396764,5,B003H6KRPM,"Sorry ppl it isn't a porno. just a more mature show that has sexual themes such as side boob, panty shots and near nude/after sex scenes.

but besids the fan service for those that are just into that stuff, it does have a pritty damn good story.

well if your into the secret agent stuff with some kick ass fight scenes and are into a modern retro anime look then 009-1 is someting that you should defenatly check out. and with the cheap price tag its a bargen",1332460800,3,460,4.215909090909091
8396765,1,B003H6KRPM,"you will be very un-happy with this buy my honey & I were putting together a cd of adult sextoons, need less to say this one will not be in collections..",1313452800,,153,3.967741935483871
8396766,2,B003H6KRPM,"Oh where do I begin?

There's alot to be upset about but im going to be brief so I don't stress myself out again.

Here's the deal. I recently watched 2 spectacular Anime series' and then I bought this. ""Ergo Proxy"" and ""Claymore"" are at the top of the game but ""009-1 is so painfully underdone and that's the problem! They should have started with the main story from the begining and built from there. They did not do that so you will have to go through 7 out of 12 ""official"" episodes before things get even mildly interesting.

I can go on but that would just be nit-picking. ""009-1"" was intended for adults but has a child like appeal when it comes to story telling. I cant recommend this Anime unless the price gets down to 5 bucks and you've got 5hrs to burn.",1304121600,3,766,4.268965517241379
8396767,5,B003H6KRPM,"I am a big fan of anime that relates to other anime and expands on stories.  This kind of hints at what happens after the original 009.  This anime is about cyborg girls, always cool, and has breast guns.  The heroine is the best 009 spy around and she kicks [...]the whole series while exploring who she is and why.  Definitely a superb anime that is at least worth watching for the sexy spy intrigue and all the uses of breast machine guns.",1297209600,6,442,4.289156626506024
8396768,5,B003H6KRPM,"Smart, funny and good looking. Anime an adult can enjoy. Action is the name of this series. Adult themes and sexual situations abound in this stylized funky little drama. Set in a world where there are only 2 super powers, eastern block and a western block, the sexy she spies fight the good fight and never worry about thier virtue. The only downside to this series is that this anime ends to soon. One more thing I nearly didn't mention, the spies are cyborgs and where some of their weapons are located are not to be beleived. Check this series out it's fun and it's cheap! A great combination.",1293235200,17,597,4.486238532110092
