2799452,5,B000OTHVWM,"Why hasn't Ink & Paint made a top 10 / best of filmation's ghost busters dvd collection 2 disc set yet? It could even include the 5 best episodes of the live ghost busters tv show from 1975 & the 5 best episodes of the cartoon series from 1986, which I hope would include the first 5 episodes of the cartoon itself played as a actual movie because it was a 5 part episode you know. It should even have carecter bios on all the main carecters from both shows & explain why Airhead, Floatsart & Fibface only apeared in 5 to 10 episodes & never again.",1298937600,,548,4.130841121495327

2799454,5,B000OTHVWM,"I purchased both volumes this month. Oh, man, does this ever take me back to my childhood! Every day, when I got home from school, I would watch the Rambo cartoon and, immediately after, Ghostbusters would be on. The characters are totally funny, the stories are terrific and the series is just straight-up entertaining! The cast of voice actors was great, too. Hearing Peter Cullen's voice took me back to the original Transformers, when he voiced over Optimus Prime. This is a great cartoon for people of all ages!",1285372800,,516,4.808988764044944
2799455,5,B000OTHVWM,"LOved it, when i was little and still after 30 years still enjoy this great silly show! And its pretty cheap!",1284940800,,109,4.238095238095238
2799456,1,B000OTHVWM,"This is awful. It's nothing like The REAL Ghostbusters. The theme song is just as catchy as the Inspector Gadget theme song becuase they only sing one line: ""Let's go Ghostbusters Let's go! over & over again. The ghosts,monsters,aliens & the main villian look like they came from a bad 1950's/1960's horror/sci-fi flick. The Belfly bat is nothing then Scrappy-Doo in bat-form. The Main cast have little to no personality. The jokes are cheesey & phoned in a mile away. The animation is ok. The stories are goofy even for a show like this. The Gorilla is nothing more then a second-rate Scooby-Doo wannabe. This show gives me a headache just even listining to it. My advice: Get The REAL Ghostbusters dvds by DIC. I give this set a 1 out of 10.",1283472000,,743,4.593984962406015
2799457,5,B000OTHVWM,"Filmation's Ghostbusters was one of my favorite cartoons to watch when I was younger. While I also watched The ""Real"" Ghostbusters which ran in syndication and on ABC, I always preferred the Filmation Series over the Columbia Pictures version. Volume 2 gives us the final 33 episodes of this great series and a bonus disc filled with a comprehensive history of Filmation and all the series produced there.

Filmation's Ghostbusters is a spin-off from their 1975 live action series The Ghost Busters. Filmation's series follows the adventures of Jake Kong, Eddie Spenser and Tracy the super-smart-gorilla as they take on Prime Evil and his horde of ghosts who want to take over the world. These adventures take the Ghostbusters all over the world, into outer space and through time. There's humor, action and adventure in these stories and a good moral message at the end of each episode.
I enjoyed watching all the episodes, but what really made me smile was the bonus material on the last disc. It was there that I learned about the history of the Filmation Studio and learned something about the great people who produced all the cartoons I used to watch as a kid. That disc showed how much heart and passion Lou Schiemer and his staff put into producing quality cartoons that shaped two generations of children's lives. I used to enjoy his work as a child, now as a writer I appreciate his contribution to the history of American animation and children's television.

It was also great to learn about all the great people who came from Filmation and went on to produce a new generation of classics for a third generation of kids. People like Tom Tatarowicz, Paul Dini, David Wise, J. Michael Straczinski all started at the Filmation Studio and went on to produce shows like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Batman: the Animated Series, Shrek, Babylon Five and countless other great programs.

Ink and Paint do a wonderful job of transferring these cartoons for DVD release. I used to tape these shows on VHS back in the day and the video on these are as good as the day they aired in 1986. The cartoons and the bonus material together give the viewer a comprehensive look at the work on Filmation's Ghostbusters, the history of the Filmation studios and the process they utilized to make their cartoons. This is one of the best DVD boxsets I've ever had the experience of purchasing, I wish other studios would be as thorough in producing material for DVD collectors. Everything is here from character designs, scripts, and the series bible. The only thing missing were the commercials for the toys by Schaper!

Filmation's Ghostbusters Volumes One and Two are great cartoons and a Shawn James Five Star Essential Video. I highly recommend everyone pick up these boxsets!",1277596800,,2771,4.839662447257384
2799458,2,B000OTHVWM,"Not Filmation's best, but I still recommend buying them.
This is a sequel to the 1975 live action Ghostbusters show.
The sons of the live action characters travel in time in every episode (great for time travel addicts like myself), and continue in the ghost busting tradition of their parents.
The two volumes will give you all 65 episodes.
Animation quality is compatible with Filmation's He-Man & She-ra shows, being made around the same time.
Try the live action version too.
All three are recommended for serious Filmation collectors.
I'm hoping they'll do Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle next (probably Filmation's best long running show).",1190505600,,640,5.104761904761904

2799468,3,B000OTHVWM,"I wanted to like this, but my memory of it being a poor competitor to The Real Ghostbusters still stands.  The stories are weak, the animation is similar to the animated Beatlejuice show (a good thing), and the sound quality seems substandard for the time it was made.  The series also resorted to a stall tactic similar to the old Hong Kong Phooey where you get to see the same minute long transition on every episode. Get this if you want to show your 1980s nostalgia cred, but not for good tv.",1321488000,,496,4.380434782608695

8186608,3,B000OTHVWM,It was not too bad. I just watched some reruns that use to come on. I did not hate it but I did not love it the bad guys were all ghost. And just think it tried to say a moral at the end but I just could did not love the characters and plots like I did Scooby Doo.,1438992000,,264,3.4166666666666665

8186610,5,B000OTHVWM,"This the Filmation Ghostbusters with Tracy the Gorilla, Jake, Eddy and Jessica.  Don't confuse it with Peter Venkhman and Slimer.  This one is more fun I think, because it focuses around Prime Evil, who's really hilarious, though he tries not to be. Prime Evil and his henchman really made the series funny, more so than just ""busting ghosts"".  This goes along well with He-man, She-Ra, and other Filmation cartoons, and should be included in anyone's DVD collection, especially if your an 80's cartoon buff as I am.",1435881600,,516,4.908045977011494
