However, it is very instructional and useful as well as gives you a goal for your players to acheive.",1095552000,,245,4.083333333333333
7802787,5,6300131270,"IF YOU DON'T KNOW TECHNICAL TRAINING THIS IS FOR YOU!! This was affirmation of the the tech training I coach my team each week- for years!.  It gives the kids something to have at home and watch and then get in the backyard and do on their own  mostly.  My team is younger but motivated, older kids who want better tech skills will thrive if they use this appropriately.  I met Coach V. as a kid when he focused on and developed American soccer 20-30 years ago -We should all thank him for that!- this guy knows how to train and coach! - ANY inexperienced player or BEGINNER COACH NEEDS THIS VIDEO TO PROGRESS WITH A TEAM, I will use it for affirmation and homework - his tech training is good! You can't make the plays without the skills!  This isn't about little kid games or tactical plays it is all Tech training and user friendly done in order of progression of skills.",1026259200,10,874,4.337423312883436
7802788,4,6300131270,"This is one of the best instructional soccer videos that I have seen and used.  The way the instructor gradually builds you up to learning basic soccer skills is not only very effective, but fun.  The instructor has a very likeable personality and style of teaching and at times can actually be funny.  His eastern european accent and humorous, yet rigid manner, give him an almost ""Colonel Klink"" like quality that is fun to watch.  This video will definately take kids and adults that have never touched a soccer ball, and get them up to speed real fast.",1012003200,11,556,4.642857142857143
