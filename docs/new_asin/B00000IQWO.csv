1228245,5,B00000IQWO,"Although some of my friends thought there was too much detail (and I did on first viewing), this video becomes more and more simple the more you view it and practice his steps.  Indeed, the beauty of the video is that it  is detailed and can serve as a one stop clinic for developing the same  swing that the pros use (and most good golfers even if not pros).  Try it  and review it over and over after you practice.  It is very good and I am a  highly critical person.  It is not for people who are intuitive about their  swing but is excellent for people who are analytical.",962496000,63,576,4.163636363636364
1228246,5,B00000IQWO,"Excellent video presentation of proper golf swing mechanics. The ""death moves"" are helpful pointers for what not to do. I think this video will improve most golfers mechanics. It will, at the very least, give you a clear understanding of the various body movements that are required to properly execute the golf swing.",949708800,3,318,5.018867924528302
1228276,5,B00000IQWO,One of the best golf videos dealing with the swing. Very detailed and meant to be used in steps. Good exercises for practice. He gives you strategies to practice at the range. This video has helped my game.,1213833600,,206,4.447368421052632
1228277,5,B00000IQWO,"(VHS) If I had this tape 30 years ago it sure would've saved me a lot of misery on the course. The most important thing this video gave me was a true 'feel' for what the golf swing was all about. After a month, my confidence was very high on the course and for a two-week period I had ""it,"" even a hole-in-one. Then an old college football injury sidelined me. It's called the 8-step but, as Jim says in the video, you can make it a 4-step if you want. I can't recommend this tape enough.",1213488000,,488,4.041237113402062
1228278,5,B00000IQWO,"This is all you will need to improve your golf swing. It should be your only source for golf swings. In fact, it helped me tremendously. Although other books/videos have helped, they don't teach you what to look for, avoid for or common mistakes golfers make.

Keep in mind though, Jim doesn't explain his setup so if you're wondering why the ball is placed where its placed or how to grip the golf club, do some research before you watch this video.

Every step has a descriptive instruction to how to perform well and what NOT to do. Jim break down the whole golf swing into 8 parts to show you how every little details count. It also contains drills to how to perfect that step. If you don't learn anything from this video or if you cannot master your swing with this video, I really can't think of anything else that can. The bottomline is, you get your moneys worth for watching this 2-hour video. It beats taking golf lessons at a junior college or hiring a professional golfer. The concept is the same thing.",1209772800,2,1015,4.451612903225806
1228279,5,B00000IQWO,"My Dad got me playing golf in the fifth grade and up until the end of my freshman year in high school,,,,I played by swinging naturally. But, the following year, my swing went down hill because I did not understand my golf swing. So, I quit playing for twenty years,,,,then started playing again. Thanks to this video, I'm improving now. This video demonstrates exactly what you should be doing in the golf swing. The way that Jim McLean repeatedly shows each position,,,,,especially the 5th position, should help to improve anyones swing. There are a couple of clips of pros that should be viewed in slow motion to view the 8 steps,,,as well as normal speed to get a sense of the timing and fluidity of a professional golf swing.
If this DVD could be improved, it would be by the addition of more professional swings which could be studied.",1186099200,7,841,4.651006711409396
1228280,5,B00000IQWO,"If you are beyond the beginner level golfer and are looking for a thorough explanation of the golf swing this DVD is the one.

I play off a mid handicap and have been working really hard at improving my consistency. I have finally found some golf instruction that leaves ""no stone unturned"" in its analysis of the swing.

No wonder Jim McLean is such a highly regarded teacher! His presentation of the complex and detailed material is faultless and at the same time is not complicated. If you take it slowly, as I have, there is nothing that is too difficult to comprehend.

I had hesitated to by this DVD because I incorrectly thought it would be another glib and trite lesson package. It is not. It is remarkably good and will last me for years. In fact I can see myself returning to go back to the basics of the swing each time I strike problems, which unfortunately I am sure will happen.

In my opinion the ""pick"" of all golf instruction dvd's that I have seen, for the improving golfer, are this DVD, Dave Stockton and Ben Crenshaw's ""Insights from the Masters of Putting"" and Simon Holmes' ""Digital Golf School, Golf Strategy"".",1181088000,11,1134,4.544117647058823
1228281,5,B00000IQWO,"This video really helped me get my swing back.  I had not felt comfortable with my golf swing for a year.  I watched the video and in just days, I'd dropped about 10 strokes (I have to admit I was pretty bad.)  But, my swing feels comfortable to me now.  It was easy to see the problem when you knew where the club should be and the position your body should be in with each step.  When I go back to my old habits, I watch parts of the video again.  Another plus was that my husband watched it with me, and his game also improved.",1180483200,2,530,3.952830188679245
1228282,5,B00000IQWO,"The first time you watch this it will blow you away...there is so much information you can't possibly digest all of it or even try to comprehend it. It is definitely for people who already understand the golf swing but want to get much better.
McLean obviously understands the swing well and knows how to answer the questions you constantly ask yourself about wheather or not you're doing it right. You will be able to go directly to the places on the tape where you have problems and questions about those problems, identify what you're doing wrong, and fix it. You'll review this tape any time you have a problem or question about your swing. Each time you watch it to figure out your swing, you'll say ""yes, that's what I'm doing wrong (now).""
If you're index is less than 20, this book will help. If you don't know what an index is, it probably won't.",1061596800,4,855,4.487179487179487
1228283,5,B00000IQWO,"I am a self tought golfer and have wondered for years what I was really supposed to be doing; now I know.  This video is extremely detailed and may confusing to a beginner.  However, if you're serious about being good then this is the tape for you.",993772800,19,248,4.25531914893617
1228284,5,B00000IQWO,"What a fine video.  It helped me drop my score by ten.  I took a lesson recently, and the instructor was amazed at the change in my form.  I watch it frequently before I practice, and find that it makes the time spent much more efficient.  Plus, I can practice the transition between the steps outlined virtually anywhere and anytime, without taking a full swing, and looking foolish or breaking lamps.  You'll be very happy with this.  I must say, though, that my wife found this much less helpful.  Ladies may want to find another video.",977875200,13,539,4.552083333333333

7911426,5,B00000IQWO,"Very comprehensive but yet not confusing book about the golf swing.  Jim breaks down the swing into 8 easy to understand steps and describes the corridors of success to be in with each step.

7911429,1,B00000IQWO,"I'm just going to keep it short.  If you want 50 (negative) swings thoughts running thru your mind at the time you are going to swing, this DVD is for you.  Even though he (Jim) discloses that you should not have all these thoughts while you swing, he fails to know how the brain works processing information. You can't tell the brain ""don't do that"" without engraving the negative impulse.  It's like telling a child don't get near the stove because it will toast your hand.  Thus the child, every time he walks thru a kitchen he sees a stove and thinks about his hand burned into pieces.
  I'm saying this beacuse thru the video, for every of his ""8-steps"" he emphasizes on certain ""death moves"" that you should not make.  He even throws in a huge graphic of a ""poison skull"" that I can still see in my dreams. For every step, as he says, there are 5 to 6 ""death moves"" at the very least.  He indicates in detail and dcor, that if you make any of these ""death moves"" at any stage of your swing you are, and I quote: ""dead, history, done, toast, thru"".
Any modern teacher either of golf or grammar school knows that negativity is the lethal ingredient in any learning process.",1258243200,7,1177,4.36697247706422
7911430,5,B00000IQWO,"This instruction is awesome!  I have been playing golf now for just about 2 years and is now scoring in the mid to low 80's because of this DVD. The only knocks are that it is not for someone too knew to golf. There are no instructions on setup, grip, ball placement, knee bend and spine angle.  It will not address the ""FUNDAMENTALS"" of golf.  It will not address game play and decision making, or short game. It will however help you to construct a solid, repeatable, consistent swing. I was not able to digest all of the instruction at once, it has taken me months of watching this DVD time and time again, tweaking my swing steps after mastering each individual steps one by one. You won't be able to watch this DVD and in 2 weeks you become a low handicapper. But you will be able to see your swing become more consistent and reliable as you master each step. It still takes time, but it gives you great direction. I suggest you learn ""fundamentals"" first from someone like Ben Hogan possibly then move to this.",1248134400,,1016,4.3936170212765955
7911431,4,B00000IQWO,"The guide has created a new approach in golf for me. Every steps has been described in details. especially, i love all the ""death moves"" warning from Jim. The only downside is that there are not many shots from side angles which is essential for a high handicap player like me as well as slow motion shots.",1244851200,,306,4.385964912280702
7911432,5,B00000IQWO,Clear concise instruction on how the arms and body work in the golf swing. Clear communication at a good pace makes this golf instruction DVD a worthwhile addition to your library.,1232150400,,180,4.838709677419355
