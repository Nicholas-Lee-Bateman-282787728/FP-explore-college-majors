7883564,1,6305137072,"This sloppy production may bathe everyone in green ""X Files"" inspired light, but sheds no light on its impossible to comprehend plot.  Some guy is traveling across country to NYC, where some girl vampires are sending hunters after each other while they gore up the city.  It does not help matters that all the women here look the same, so you never quite know who is who.  The gore here consists mostly of fake blood, and there is no nudity.  This makes for a very tedious and very boring eighty minutes.  Do not taint your VCR with this shot on video wannabe horror flick.
This is unrated and contains physical violence, gore, and profanity.",1019952000,,642,4.5964912280701755
7883565,4,6305137072,"Addicted to Murder 2: Tainted Blood ditches the disturbing tone of the original. This one has a faster pace, a more solid narrative, and even a quirky sense of humor. And since we don't spend the entire movie with that  sad-sack serial killer Joel Winter (Mick McCleery), this time around it's a  lot more fun.
Most of Tainted Blood takes place before the events in  Addicted to Murder, making this a prequel of sorts. When we first see Joel  again, it's not too long after his first vampire love Rachel has just  abandoned him. He packs up his stuff and high-tails it out of his Michigan  hometown, hoping to find another girl like Rachel somewhere out there.  Meanwhile, there are problems in the vampire community. Rachel has begun  bestowing ""the gift"" upon people who aren't worthy, and her  sister Angie (Sasha Graham) must put an end to it. Fans of the original  will get new insight into the lives of Joel and Angie -- but you'll also be  introduced to some interesting new characters as well.
Among the new  faces is a novice vampire named Tricia (Sarah K. Lippmann), just a nice  girl looking for love in New York City. In a witty bit of dark humor, she  places a singles ad in the newspaper, but still can't seem to find a love  connection. One dating disaster ends with the guy upset because she bit  him. ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to,"" she says. Tricia starts out  denying her bloodthirsty cravings, but she'll eventually have to give in to  her animalistic urges. Sarah K. Lippmann is wonderful in the role, and I'd  like to see more from her in the future.
We also meet a bloodsucker with  a bad attitude named Jonathan (Ted Grayson), who Angie enlists to watch  over Tricia and make sure she doesn't leave too many trails of blood  behind. Ah, the trials and tribulations of being one of the undead.
Technically, Addicted to Murder 2: Tainted Blood is a real improvement  over the first, since the sound and image quality are a lot clearer.  Director Kevin Lindenmuth's distinct visual style still shines through, as  he continues to add nifty stylistic flourishes to accent the mood -- like  bathing some scenes in lush red light.
Some may argue that the film  lacks focus, but I liked the way it managed to examine a varied cast of  characters and still remain as tight and compact as it is. Like the first  film, it has documentary-style interviews inserted throughout (including  one with a vampire hunter played by Ted V. Mikels, director of such cult  classics as The Corpse Grinders and Astro Zombies), but they aren't quite  as intrusive as they were the first time around. Some of the special  effects come off as a bit cheesy, but what the hell? Addicted to Murder 2  is a dark, clever, and amusing horror film that actually breathes some  fresh life into the vampire subgenre.",961286400,,2803,4.616632860040568
