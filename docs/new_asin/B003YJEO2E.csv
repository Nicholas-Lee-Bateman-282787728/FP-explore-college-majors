8409435,4,B003YJEO2E,"I enjoyed this DVD. Especially on days when there is not so much freedom in my schedule for exercising. The cardio portion will get the heart rate up there. The weight portion is good as well, you might have to increase your weight amounts to feel it, but worth the time. Try doing both 20 minute segments back to back- wonderful!",1332979200,3,330,4.426229508196721
8409436,1,B003YJEO2E,"I work out every day, I have owned or downloaded probably more than a hundred fitness videos, and this is BY FAR the worst video I have ever tried. Each segment is about a minute long, where silicone enhanced robot introduces herself and her trainer. Then they do three or four of a move, then tell you to go do 3 sets of 12. Why the heck would I get a video where I have to count the reps myself, and there's nothing to look at? What's the point of getting a video, just look at a fitness magazine, or go fight over weights with the roid necks at the gym. Boring. Pointless. Infuriating. And expensive. Don't waste your time and money, I wish I hadn't!",1314576000,9,653,4.190476190476191
8409437,4,B003YJEO2E,"I am an intermediate exerciser in my 40's.  I tried both the cardio and the toning in the same day.  For me, the cardio was not advanced enough.  You do a few different types of moves for 20 seconds then stop while steve explains the next move.  I prefer more of a routine to follow.  But the toning was surprisingly good and moved to the next move much quicker.  I will keep this dvd as an add on to my other workouts.  Both steve and nicole are pleasant to workout with.",1308009600,,472,4.1208791208791204
8409438,5,B003YJEO2E,I had a chance to try out Cardio Red Zone and Cardio Red Zone Toning on Demand through Exercise TV. Both programs provided just the right amount of variation and intensity to make it interesting. I especially loved Steve Maresca's positive energy. I will definitely be purchasing this DVD.,1288051200,3,289,4.918367346938775
8409439,4,B003YJEO2E,"A lot of times when I buy a workout dvd I struggle with staying consistent but that hasn't been the case with this ExerciseTV one. Steve really motivates me and I like to see Nicole pushing through the workouts. Since I tone quite often, I've really enjoyed challenging myself with the cardio. I think it's top notch and I'm already feeling a difference in the way my clothes fit. Definitely would recommend.",1281484800,3,408,4.680555555555555
8409440,4,B003YJEO2E,"I own a lot of fitness DVDs, and this cardio workout is one of the best.  I like strength training, but I don't do it as often as cardio and its harder for me to see the results. When I do between 20-30 minutes of cardio 3X week I can feel myself losing weight and getting more fit, so I like to switch my routine often to keep it from getting stale.  Alternating between this DVD and jogging or classes at my gym  still leaves me seeing the results that I want and getting the level of cardio that I am accustomed to.  Plus her trainer is great!",1281484800,4,546,4.027777777777778
