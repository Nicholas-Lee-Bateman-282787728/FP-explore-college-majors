7895368,4,6305769761,I enjoyed this movie. It's an older movie and has a good story to it. I'll take a good story over great visual effects and huge budget anytime.,1496102400,,143,4.142857142857143

7895372,4,6305769761,"Judgement Day (1988) In 1689, the people of a town made a deal with Satan - if he were to lift a deadly plague, he could have the town alone for one day each year. Unfortunately for Charlie and his college buddies, they chose the wrong day for a visit!

This was complete fun to finish. If it had been made in the US and and not in the Philippines in the 80's, it might have been another The Brotherhood of Satan (1971), but now it's just forgotten and buried.",1384300800,,460,4.111111111111111
7895373,5,6305769761,"Judgement Day (1988) In 1689 Shot in the Philippines, this campy but enjoyably surreal occult thriller finds a quartet of wayward college kids trapped in the cursed village of Santana, a town whose founders made a pact with Satan centuries ago to spare themselves from a plague epidemic.

 It seems the villagers' end of the bargain allowed for the Devil's return each year to pick up a handful of fresh souls free of charge and it's no surprise who's on Scratch's list this time around. Writer-director Ferde Grofe, Jr. makes good use of some rustic locations, and the scenes of demonic hordes swarming through the streets are quite chilling. Also a plus: the young protagonists are presented as fairly well-rounded and intelligent, instead of mere cyphers waiting their turn to become demon-fodder.",1327881600,,800,5.053030303030303

7895375,5,6305769761,I saw this movie when it first came out like 20 years ago. It must have made a pretty big impression on me because I have been searching for the name of it forever. I couldn't remember the name and only some details but I finally found it. I would like to watch it again because it was pretty good from what I remember but yeah I don't really want to pay 50 bucks for some old VHS thats been rented out 1000 times. I didn't realize it was a collectors item.,1217548800,4,457,3.9782608695652173
7895376,5,6305769761,"Hey this is a great flick,i've been wanting to pick up a copy for a while now but 60/70 dollars for a VHS tape,maybe thats why the same ones have been up for sale so long?Get real and maybe they'll sell.",1184112000,2,203,3.975609756097561
7895377,3,6305769761,"Judgement Day is similar to Armageddon and Deep Impact, which came out around the same time in 1998-1999. But if I had to choose the best PLOT of any of the ""big rock hits earth"" movies, it would be Judgement Day. However, there are a few actors who just do not fit the roles they are cast in. Yet the three primary actors are Ice-T, Suzi Amis, and Mario Van Peebles. Their roles are solid and convincing.
There are about fifty dollars worth of special effects in the movie and, being a ""big rock in space, hits earth"" movie, that should tell you something.
If you get this, do so for the story. The plot (with minor development) is by far excellent compared to any of the other movies of this genre.",1008460800,5,700,4.3106060606060606
