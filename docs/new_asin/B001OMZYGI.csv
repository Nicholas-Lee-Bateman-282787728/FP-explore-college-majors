3730574,5,B001OMZYGI,Well I had seen this series prior to buying it but I enjoyed it so much I longed to view it again I think it is a worthy purchase if you like drama and action and sci-fi. overall I am  pleased could not have worked out better.,1351296000,2,226,3.8085106382978724
3730575,5,B001OMZYGI,"In a future based disaster stricken city there is a giant gap between the rich and poor. Many people were hurt during the ""Blast Fall"", and have cybernetic implants that give them super human strength. Roy is a bounty hunter who lost his family in the disaster. One day he is saved by a girl with no name or memory. He takes her in and names her Solty. Solty's body is almost entirely cybernetic. Her past is a mystery that holds some very shocking secrets and revelations about the current state of the world.

This anime took me by surprise. It's story is pretty unique and very interesting. The animation, voice acting, and music are all very good. The massive amount of cool characters is also a plus. There is also a good mix of action, drama, and comedy in it as well. The drama is very emotional at times. I bought this anime when it was new and payed an okay price for it, but now a S.A.V.E. edition is even better. I definitely recommend this anime to any fan. I truly believe you'll love it.",1350604800,4,1001,4.352941176470588
3730576,5,B001OMZYGI,"Solty Rei is what kindled my passion for Anime. It's a rare gem, a diamond in the rough, if you will.

The story's fairly simplistic. A man searching for his missing daughter meets a girl with no memory of her past. Together they, along with others they come across, try to find answers and, in the long run, create a bond (willingly on her part, warily on his).

There's more to the story than that but it is better to see and experience it for yourself rather than sit and read someone else's impression, at least in my humble opinion.

So, if you like sci-fi, action, adventure, robot-girls; then Solty Rei is something you might enjoy.",1339718400,14,639,4.491379310344827
3730577,2,B001OMZYGI,"Due has a serious gun and some killer skills but most of the movie didn't show any of that. it was a bumch ofother stuff that just didn't make much sense to me. he is a bounty hunter but after watching 100s of minutes he catches like 3 or 4 people. whats up with that? the anime is crisp. the voices are clear. the chicks are hot(as always)

I was hoping for Cowboy Bebop with more guns. The animation was there but... oh-well.",1315267200,,427,4.144578313253012
3730578,5,B001OMZYGI,"Solty Rei is in my opinion one of the greatest Anime's of all time period. Though it usually is only 24 episodes this DVD set as 2 extra ones. The animation and lighting effects are outstanding, the voices phenominal, the characters unforgetable, the story simply amazing, the ending made me cry.

This is a must buy for any Anime fan anywhere, I strongly urge you to pick this up as soon as possible, before it becomes one of the lost gems of Anime Lore. It will not disappoint.....",1299024000,4,483,4.488636363636363
3730579,4,B001OMZYGI,This Anime is exactly like all of the others by Funimation... I am getting pretty tired of watching the same thing over and over again... but i am addicted... so i will probably still buy and watch Funimation stuff.,1288915200,2,215,4.538461538461538
3730580,4,B001OMZYGI,This story is filled with many complex story lines. This does require some attention to detail. The crying can get drug out. The basic premise of the story is... no spoilers here. I liked this very much (but I also liked Spice and Wolf-- so there you go).,1285286400,3,255,4.333333333333333
3730581,2,B001OMZYGI,"Meet Roy, he used to be an officer who played by the rules but, turned bounty hunter when losing his daughter to a mysterious event known as the blast fall. When out on a job gone wrong, a strange girl intervenes to save Roy, her name is Solty.

From this point on, the plot takes a major detour which will undeniably leave you wondering, what just happened and why does it seem like every episode, someone different is crying about absolutely nothing. Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate dramatic series with heavy moments emphasized by crying characters. But, even this was a bit much. Then the icing on the cake, the fittingly climactic moment followed by one of those ridiculous, many years later sub titles, where all we see is only two characters from a larger cast sharing a completely useless moment. Where do you think blank is? says 1. I'm sure blank is out there somewhere and everything is fine, says 2. Sadly it's not, The End.",1284768000,3,945,4.5588235294117645
3730582,3,B001OMZYGI,"Since this was my first SAVE item, didn't know what to expect. The box is small and the clamps to hold the disks broke off. If you don't care for looks and want to save money, this is great. If you like the box sets and their quality, then buy the box set.",1284681600,3,256,3.849056603773585
3730589,5,B001OMZYGI,"I loved this anime series when it first came out and I was happy to purchase the full series here.  This anime has a nice plot about a futuristic time~  The series is about the main protagonist and his encounter with someone that isn't human or a cyborg while trying to uncover what's really going on in the city limits and the higher up officials.  Really good series, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys androids, cyborgs, futuristic times, mystery, and action!",1416700800,,469,4.626506024096385
3730590,5,B001OMZYGI,"After a mysterious phenomenon that has come to be known as the blast fall kills thousands or people and leaves thousands of other people injured or missing society recovers with the aid of resemble (cybernetic) technology. One of the survivors of the blast fall is a gruff no nonsense bounty hunter that is still searching for his missing daughter that disappeared during the blast fall. He soon meets a young girl with amnesia that is determined to stay by his side and when he is unable to sway her determination he reluctantly teams up with her. And just as the two of them are beginning to get used to one another in walks a blonde bombshell that has her own plans for the girl. What follows is a highly entertaining thrill ride filled with laughs, tears, thrills and spills which are made even better by the shows excellent soundtrack that similarly enhances the show like cowboy bebops music did it.

The animation is gorgeous, the characters are compelling, the story is intriguing and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any anime fan and one of my favorite animes!

Be warned this anime contains some graphic violence and occasional profanity.",1416096000,,1179,4.746341463414634
3730591,5,B001OMZYGI,Love this anime! Been trying to finish this series for years glad I found it after all this time. This anime will have you on edge every moment. Spoiler: The ending will surprise you!! ^_^,1414022400,,188,4.4
3730592,5,B001OMZYGI,"Excellent story line, The artwork is pristine and flawless. Though the musical score leaves a bit to be desired, the soloist singing ""The Rose"" in the last few segments was horribly off key, but aside from that, I loved the emotional conflicts in this series, Roy's dillema of loosing his daughter in the blast fall, then finding solty, accepting her as a make-shift daughter, then finding rose as his true daughter. The author of this storyline must have been a parent to understand the subtle nuances that go on within a family, especially a family that has been torn apart and struggles to be put back together.
  The Comedy in this series is quite funny as well, True, it is a drama, but it does have it's light hearted moments. A Great show, and one that I will watch over and over. Its just that good!",1413676800,,807,4.52054794520548
3730593,5,B001OMZYGI,"I loved this anime from the first moment that I saw it.  The characters are full and rich, and interact together in a very believable way.  Everyone I've shown this too has loved it in turn, and I've given it as a gift to a lot of other people.
The basic story is about a man that has lost his family in a world-wide catastrophe.  He's a bounty hunter, and he is helped one night by a young girl that has no idea who she is.  He calls her Solty and they begin to form a father/daughter bond wholly against the man's will.  Of course, Solty is the key to helping the world, and of course that puts her in extreme danger, but you'll have to watch all the way to the end of the credits on the last episode to see what happens.  It's worth it though...totally!
As you could tell, I can't recommend this anime highly enough.",1402012800,,819,4.119496855345912
3730594,5,B001OMZYGI,"Solty is shrouded in mystery, but her true self proves to be more than anticipated. The story line is simple, Detached male figure encounters mysterious girl. He stubbornly tries to keep her at a distance, while she miraculously wiggles her way into not only his life, but his heart.
Roy is a bounty hunter, Solty is a ""Well let say unique"" they end up working together which takes them down a path of a father daughter relationship. They have a couple of great friends that are involved in Roy's line of work and they have a few that are on the wrong side of the law, but with ""Robin Hood"" like intentions. As the show unfolds, the simple plot of catching bad guys, turns out to be connected to something much larger. A scheme that endangers the entire city and the lives of everyone in it. Solty, Roy and their companions stand together to stop Catastrophe from happening. This show has a great deal of growth between the characters, lots of laughs, and a few ""good"" tears. You just can't help getting attached to the characters, and relating to their experiences and emotions. My entire family really enjoyed Solty Rei and are glad to have added it to our collection.",1380758400,,1170,4.576190476190476
3730595,5,B001OMZYGI,"This anime is good and sweet. at first I thought I wasn't gonna like it. But I was good, solty is sweet, Rose was funny. whoever doesn't like this anime there is something wrong with you. This a 5 stars, worth watching again and again. The plot is interesting",1367798400,3,259,4.3061224489795915
3730596,5,B001OMZYGI,I really liked this series. It had just the right amouint of what I expect from an anime series. The main character at first makes you wonder what's going on and the being pick up by a guy whose kid was hurt by what the main character was involved in makes it all the more interesting. Well worth the buying!,1362528000,3,308,4.15
3730597,5,B001OMZYGI,I bought this used and in very good condiction. The DVD's are in great shape and the DVD cover has only a few scuffs. The plastic thing that holds disc four is broken though so I have to be careful opening the case as to not let the disc fall out.,1358640000,2,247,3.8627450980392157
3730598,5,B001OMZYGI,Solty Rei is a super great anime story. Its fun how the characters interact and how things can be serious at the sametime. I think another season needs to be made. I strongely thing another season would be really cool because I think everyone including myself wants to know what happen to Solty after they find her. I highly recommend Solty Rei!!,1351814400,2,346,4.596774193548387

8330846,5,B001OMZYGI,"A wonderful story about family and how anything is possible as long as you have eachother. Please enjoy my review.

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Rei (pronounced Roy) Revant (voiced by Christopher Sabat) is a bounty hunter. 12 years ago a giant explosion called The Blast Fall destroyed a large portion of town with a lighting bolt. Leaving many dead, many wounded and some people missing. Rei was once a cop untill the blast fall that caused his daughter Rita to go missing. Refusing to believe she is dead after 12 years he continues to look. One day while chasing down a bounty he is ambushed by the one he is hunting, when he is about to get his a mysterious girl with green hair falls from the sky on the attacker and causes him to run away. Rei thanks the young girl and goes on his business. He knowtices the girl is following him around. Asking her whats her deal she tells him she has no memory of anything other than when she hit the attack after falling from the sky. After a few minor adventurs he adopts her as her naming her Solty Revant (voiced by Carrie Savage). Now they both go on bounty hunts as well as other adventures to find out who Solty really is and for Rei to find his daughter Rita.

Pros: the story really is top notch, its amazing and will keep you hooked on minuet one like it did me. This version really is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you will get all the blood, action and minor swearing (there really isn't much) that the show has to offer. The show really shows that no matter if you are family by blood or adoption you really are family. It is such a touching show.

Episode Pros: Even thow it says it comes with all 24 episodes, this also comes with a special double episode in 1 OVA.

Cons: The ending some people might not like the ending but I thought it was good.

Over all: I liked this series alot, BUY IT!!",1454803200,,1864,4.299145299145299
8330847,5,B001OMZYGI,"I've watched countless anime mini series, both well known and obscure. Solty Rei, hits on every note and heart string I have. A little quirky, spunky, perhaps. You'll find plenty of action, sentimental value, romance, drama, and comedy, too.
