8289601,5,B001CUAZGG,"In this episode the the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series, they shine the spotlight on the Ford Thunderbird through the years from it's creation in the mid 1950s to the 1990s.

I thought the DVD did a good job of showing the impetus behind the design and introduction of the ""T-bird"". Both Chevrolet and Ford had teams looking at a sports car in the tradition of the British MGs and Triumphs. Chevrolet was first out of the gate with the Corvette, but the 'Vette had a six-cylinder motor and a 2-speed automatic tranny and just didn't have the convenience options Americans wanted.

Enter the Thunderbird which had a V-8, power options, a steel body and a lower price than the Corvette. The Thunderbird easily outsold the Corvette and was quite a feather in Ford's cap as a styling statement. But, there was a storm on the horizon.

The fact is that a two-seater has a much smaller market and even though the Thunderbird easily outsold the Corvette, it wasn't going to sell enough cars to ensure its survival. The difficult decision was made to give the car a back seat. Although this changed the car forever, it sold three times as many as the two-seat version and insured its continuing survival.

The DVD goes on to show all the different versions of the Thunderbird through the 1960s and 1970s when a drop-off in quality and style almost did it in. In the 1980's though, the T-bird once again took off in popularity with the aerodynamic, rounded look in the 1980s.

The video is only 50 minutes long, but it covers a lot of ground over a long time period, showing the various incarnations of the Thunderbird using period film, stills and modern footage of restored cars in the hands of collectors of today. I liked it and recommend it to Thunderbird or classic car fans with five stars.",1449100800,,1795,4.649842271293376
