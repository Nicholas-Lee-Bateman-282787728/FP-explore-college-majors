644940,5,630344587X,A great classic movie with very human characteristics portraying the communist take over of Russia during WWI and the horrors that followed during this struggle for power between the Red and White forces.,1322265600,,204,5.212121212121212
644941,2,630344587X,"""Knight without Armour"" is a 1937 black and white historical drama that was commonplace in the British cinema in the 30s, often pointing out the foibles involved in European politics and serving as a warning about contemporary events in European as the shadow of WW 2 drew ever closer. The film stars Marlene Dietrich as a Russian countess being persecuted by the ""Reds"" and Robert Donat as a British spy who is aligned with the ""Whites"" and tries to rescue her.

The film was adapted from a 1933 James Hilton (1900-54) novel. Many of Hilton's novels became films - ""Lost Horizon"" (1937), ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" (1939), ""Random Harvest"" (1942).

Marlene Dietrich (1901-92) appeared in more than a dozen films, some as early as 1919, before she had her ""breakthrough"" in ""The Blue Angel"" (1929). She was a major star in the 30s (""Morocco"", ""Shanghai Express"", ""Destry Rides Again"") and was nominated for an Oscar (""Morocco"" in 1930) and a Golden Globe (""Witness for the Prosecution"" in 1957 - my personal Dietrich favorite).

FWIW - Dietrich received $350,000 for the film, a record amount.

Robert Donat (1905-58) is not well remembered today, but he was a major presence in such films as ""The 39 Steps"" (1935), ""The Citadel"" (1938) and ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" (1939) for which he won the Oscar. For this film he was billed before Dietrich.

FWIW - Donat had a severe attack of asthma during filming and Dietrich forever referred to the film jokingly as ""Knight with Asthma"".

John Clements (1910-88) has a small role as a Commissar stricken by Dietrich, but he was so good that Korda gave him the lead in ""Four Feathers"" (1940) He was popular in the late 30s and 40s and made nearly 30 films between 1935 and 1982.

Hay Petrie (1895-1948) plays the mad station master. Petrie was popular in the 30s and 40s - his best role was in ""Contraband"" (1940). Big Peter Bull (1912-84) is a Commissar. You'll remember Bull from his role as the Russian ambassador in ""Dr Strangelove"" (1964).

Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including ""Rise of Catherine the Great"" (1934), ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""Rembrandt"" (1936). Korda was known for his cheap production values, which are often evident in this film, although some of the scenes are better than others.

Miklos Rozsa (1907-95) scored more than 100 films and earned 16 Oscar nominations and 3 wins (""A Double Life"", ""Spellbound"", ""Ben Hur""). His work in this film is excellent. BTW - he plays the pianist in the film.

Film fans will recognize the homage to ""Battleship Potemkin"" in the scene in which the ""Reds"" attack Dietrich, a reversal of the Potemkin scene in which the ""Whites"" attack the woman on the steps.

1937 was a pretty meager year in films. The top grossing films were ""Snow White"", ""Saratoga"", ""One Hundred Men and a Girl"", ""Topper"", and ""Wee Willie Winkie"". The Oscars went to ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (Picture), ""The Awful Truth"" (Director), ""The Good Earth"" (Actress) and ""Captains Courageous"" (Actor). Other notable releases that year were ""Dead End"", ""The Prince and the Pauper"", the Marx Brothers ""A Day at the Races"", and ""A Star is Born"". Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland made their first film together (""Thoroughbreds Don't Cry"") and 17 year old Lana Turner appeared in ""They Won't Forget"" and became ""the Sweater girl"". Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were voted the King and Queen of Hollywood.

One of the problems with this film is its episodic nature and the clear influence of silent film techniques, including the endless use of the slow fade and Dietrich's own extreme facial posturing. This is probably the fault of French director Jacques Feyder (1885-1948) who was primarily a silent film director. In addition, the film was either poorly thought out or suffered from terrible editing. There are scenes that add nothing to the plot (e.g., the opening scenes at Ascot) while scenes that should have been there (e.g., the character and/or fate of Dietrich's husband) are missing.

Bottom line - a tedious film about the Russian revolution with some good performances, but poor production values and a poor script.",1314748800,4,4305,4.888888888888889
644942,4,630344587X,"This is a terrific movie; it's too bad most people have never even heard of it.  Besides being an entertaining adventure/romance, it's a quite surprisingly accurate and evocative representation of the chaos of Revolutionary and Civil War Russia.  I know a lot about this period in history and, in addition to the story itself, I think an exemplary job was done with the sets, exteriors, and other visuals; sometimes it's hard to remember that this was all filmed in England, not Russia.

The only drawback is the current condition of the image.  Very murky and muddy.  I've never seen a good copy of the film, so it's possible that this is the best we can hope for.  It would be so great to be able to see a properly restored copy, though....",1309132800,6,742,4.583333333333333
644943,4,630344587X,"...was Dietrich's pet name for this film. She was known for taking an intimate interest in her co stars, and the story is that Marlene was anxious to do a film with the dashing, sexy Robert Donat. Surprise! Although uber charming and attractive on screen, Donat was a very married man who didn't necessarily fool around with his leading ladies. He also suffered from severe asthma (he died relatively young of this disease in the days before modern treatments) and could barely finish the film because of breathing problems, let alone romance Dietrich (their on screen chemistry, however, is very good in spite of their lack of intimacy off screen). Despite these behind-the-scenes problems, ""Knight without Armour"" is a very good film with high production values.

As a British spy keeping an eye on the Russians in the days before the revolution, Donat is on such deep background that he gets swallowed up  by the revolution, spends time in a Siberian prison and joins the Bolsheviks, rising to a level high enough to gain him respect amongst the reds. In this capacity he encounters countess Dietrich who is beautiful (she really is in this film), helpless, and about to be very abused by  the revolutionaries. Donat makes it his  business to rescue  and protect her until he can get her completely out of the revolutionary mess. The story switches back and forth between the white Russians and red Russians, giving the viewer an interesting look at the civil war, and the changing fortunes of the people caught up in the madness. Of course the pair fall in love and have some thrilling chase scenes with their pursuers until they either escape or not. I won't ruin the ending, but it is a shame that the dvd is not available in the USA. The film is shown sometimes on TCM, so if you have a DVR record it, I think you will be glad you did.",1281052800,15,1842,4.655384615384615
644944,4,630344587X,"Staring Marlene Dietrich and Robert Donat, KNIGHT WITHOUT ARMOUR (1937).

This is a Korda production, so it pretty much goes without saying (at least to anyone that knows Korda Bros. movies) that this is top notch all the way, sets, costumes, everything.

Donat is a writer working in Russia just before WW1. Dietrich is an aristocrat with a father who is none to popular with angry Bolsheviks. Donat is recruited to be a spy for his country when WW1 breaks out and changes both their lives. Donat and Dietrich spend a lot of the movie on the run, getting burned by both bloodthirsty sides during the Russian Civil War.

This is more the suave Donat from COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO as opposed to the more ""academic"" Donat from things like MR CHIPS and THE CITIDEL. Like Mr. Chips, this movie is based on a book by James Hilton, whose novels RANDOM HARVEST and LOST HORIZON were also adapted into great movies.

Also of note in this movie is John Clements who is really great as a sympathetic ""Red"". Clements also did some fine work in movies such as THINGS TO COME(1936) and FOUR FEATHERS(1939). This is basically a showcase for Dietrich however. She glows in every shot she's in. There is some lovely cinematography in this by Harry Stradling, an academy award winning cinematographer for THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY and MY FAIR LADY. He has many other fine film credits under his belt, including STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.
There are so many lovely shots in this film. One scene with Marlene running in a flowing white nightgown outside across the grounds of her grand estate. A great opening shot at a race track that fills the screen with men in top hats. A lovely silhouette shot of Donat and Dietrich in a carriage, black against white clouds.
Some really fine work here both technically, musically (it features a great Miklos Rozsa score, early in his career) and in the acting department.

Marlene was still considered box office poison at this point. Her popularity had plummeted shortly after her breakout role in THE BLUE ANGEL. KNIGHT WITHOUT ARMOUR was also considered another Dietrich flop at the box office. It wouldn't be until DESTRY RIDES AGAIN that Dietrich would be back in favor with the studios.

Donat, still two years away from Mr. Chips, suffered from a major asthma attack during filming, something he suffered with until his death. It was so severe that Korda considered replacing him. However, Dietrich went to bat for Donat with Korda and was able to keep him on the project, even going so far as to help nurse him back to health.

Anyways...it's a great dramatic action movie bordering on epic in its history based theme. Very exciting and fun movie.",1273536000,6,2670,4.7290322580645165
644945,4,630344587X,"Alexander Korda always seems like the Samuel Goldwyn of the British film industry - someone who could take promising material and a talented cast and crew and overproduce it to within an inch of its life, with only the barest handful of films escaping the dead hand of his creative influence. Knight Without Armour almost fits into that category thanks to an often clumsy script and a very awkwardly constructed first half hour, but there's a surprising degree of cynicism to its grimly realised post-Revolutionary Russia where English spy Robert Donat (given the unfortunate moniker A.J. Fothergill) and countess Marlene Dietrich (in a rare nice girl role) find themselves caught between both sides in the ensuing civil war as they try to make it to the border.

The film surprisingly finds no difference between Whites and Reds: both execute exactly the same kind of people with the same guns against the same walls as the country falls to bits around them, all strikingly realised in Lazare Meerson's vivid production design. There's a genuinely epic feel to the film too, and plenty of vivid vignettes - a quietly insane stationmaster announcing non-existent trains, a smitten young commissar saving the lovers - that carry you through despite the awkwardness of the storytelling and the lack of fire to the romance. Not a great film, certainly, but certainly a much more interesting one than expected. Keep an eye out for an uncredited Miklos Rozsa as a pianist!

The Australian PAL DVD has no extras, but does boast a good transfer.",1180310400,7,1538,4.980544747081712
644946,4,630344587X,"The story is familiar enough: Russian noblewoman abducted, and saved after many adventurers.  It seems improbable now, but the material is very close not only to historical accounts of such escapes, or even merely to the fictional Anastasia of stage and film.  Eighty years ago, nobody wold have doubted a bit of it.  Some aristocrats did escape.  Some titled and formerly rich and beautiful Russian women found their various ways to Berlin and Paris.  Several founded successful businesses based on their knowledge of and familiarity with beautiful things; they dealt in lingeree, clothing, furs, jewels.  During the 20s there actually was such a thing as Russian chic, and this film recaptures some of that romance.
Like all well-made black and white films, KNIGHT has the feeling of a dream, and that feeling is sustained throughout with the most amazing display of understated cinematic skill.  The scenario:  A beautiful woman living in a cocoon of wealth and privilege, is swept away in the middle of the night.  Led and shielded by a handsome stranger, she finds her way to political and emotional freedom, by crossing a final border, and by falling in love with her non-aristocratic guardian and savior.  She becoemes a 'real' woman.  This is fairly pure Joseph Campbell with a bit of Cocteau and Jung thrown in for good measur.  If it is not bluntly erotic enough for our time, perhaps, or for a somewhat earlier time -- think of Dr. Zivago -- it brings us back to a frame of mind that died with the First World War, when what attracted men and women to one another, had to do with character; when admiration combined with sex to form Adoration.  It was a time of ideals.  Dietrich's exceptional beauty in this film, is more than merely the beauty of an actress.  Here, it becomes symbolic of all that was beautiful in Aristocratic Russia before the Revolution.  She becomes the embodiment of some a rare and exquisite treasure very much like a Feberge jewel; something fragile, unique, astonishing.  She looks the way Rachmaninoff sounds.
This is a cinematic experience of exceptional beauty; much like a fine eau de parfum; Chanel's Russian Leather, perhaps.",1016496000,17,2169,4.914835164835165
