5813543,5,B00DHN9AHG,Great video I really enjoyed the kundalini and vinyasa options and the meditations were great!  Would love to take a live class with Tommy.,1382400000,2,139,4.791666666666667
5813544,5,B00DHN9AHG,"Tommy Rosen is a great instructor.  He offers friendly and clear instruction in a beautiful setting with amazing music.  This is great for those who like a little Vinyasa with their Kundalini.  Yoga sets:  ""Full Body Tune-Up"" vinyasa yoga 47 min.,  ""Spinal Energy Series"" kundalini yoga 30 min., ""Quick Energizer Set"" kundalini yoga 8:30 min.  Meditations:  ""Intro to Breathing"" 14 min.,  ""Meditation for Stress Relief"" 6 min., ""Alternate Nostril Breathing"" 5:30 min.  I highly recommend both of Tommy's dvds.  As a fan of Kundalini Yoga I think that they are a must to add to your yoga collection.  I also recommend Kia Miller, Gurutej, Gurmukh, Maya Fiennes and Mantra Girl.

5813545,5,B00DHN9AHG,"I bought this DVD because I was going to be attending an event that required me to do yoga twice a day ... and I was petrified, because I'd never attempted yoga before.  I'm so very happy I made the decision to buy this DVD.  It's awesome  (Tommy's other DVD is awesome, too.)  While it suggests this DVD is especially for those dealing with addiction issues, it is quite good for anyone who wants to get into Kundalini and Vinyasa Flow yoga.  Tommy is an expert instructor with a calm, charismatic teaching style.  The DVD is packed with lots of goodies ... not just yoga programs (which are thorough and challenging without being overwhelming).  I'm so hooked I'm planning to attend a live event with Tommy.  Simply can't speak highly enough of this DVD ... every time I do the programs I feel like my life changes a little bit more for the better.",1376265600,15,850,4.474025974025974
5813546,5,B00DHN9AHG,"Love these DVDs!! Tommy Rosen is an incredible teacher and pioneer in the Yoga and Recovery movement. I love how he so clearly explains and demonstrates how and why yoga works as a powerful tool in addiction recovery. His direction is easy to follow and is accessible to any level of yoga practitioner. What I love most about Recovery 2.0 and about these DVDs is that there is so much more to the practices than just your typical yoga poses. Tommy teaches breath work, practical and simple mediation techniques that are truly healing and transformational.",1375920000,9,555,4.852631578947369

8593314,5,B00DHN9AHG,Excellent video by a leader in the yoga/addiction field.,1469059200,,56,5.333333333333333
8593315,5,B00DHN9AHG,"This is an awesome video whether you are in recovery or not!  Yes it is somewhat challenging, but Rosen is encouraging and compassionate in his delivery.  I recently completed a Kundalini Teacher Training Program, and I am also a substance abuse counselor working with incarcerated individuals.  I am not allowed to actually teach the yoga to the men as yet, so I have been using this video to introduce incarcerated men, particularly incarcerated Veterans to Yoga in recovery.  I have a packed class, and many on the waiting list to join the class when space permits.  They enjoy it immensely and can't wait for the weekly session.  Thank you Tommy Rosen, for sharing your story, and giving hope to many who are still struggling.",1441152000,2,730,4.846774193548387
8593316,4,B00DHN9AHG,"This is a great routine, and Tommy delivers it well, but it would be so much better without the music.  Especially the drumming is chaotic imo and not yogic.  At least the volume was lessened as it went on.  I thought (hoped) it stopped for savasana, but chanting chimed in; distracting.",1437004800,,287,4.588235294117647

8593321,5,B00DHN9AHG,Wow,1426809600,,3,3.0
8593322,3,B00DHN9AHG,"Well produced and a good routine, but not for those new to sobriety, or yoga. If you are looking for yoga to help you detox and recover, I would look elsewhere. Find a method, video etc., for beginners or one geared to utilizing Yoga for breaking addictions and healing. This is really for someone past those stages and in good health, who has preferably been practicing for some time.",1410307200,7,385,4.594202898550725
