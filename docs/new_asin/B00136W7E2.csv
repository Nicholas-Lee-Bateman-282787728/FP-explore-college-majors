8249393,4,B00136W7E2,"When I first saw this movie, I liked it, but didn't love it. This more I thought about it, the more I liked it and wanted to watch it again. It is down to earth, yet quirky and inviting. While I had rented it the first time I saw it, I knew I had to purchase it because it would be one that I would pick up in a moment's notice to watch. Plus, it has the AWESOME Mary McDonnell rockin' it, as usual. Who can ask for more?!?!",1462060800,,424,3.7752808988764044

8249396,4,B00136W7E2,"I enjoyed this film. It did seem a bit overdone and drawn out at times. But as they say, just relax and enjoy it. The way the wife hung in there was really charming and touching.",1370390400,,178,3.9722222222222223

8249398,5,B00136W7E2,"Diesen Film kann ich nicht hoch genug bewerten. Das mag sicher eine rein subjektive Meinung sein, doch gefllt mir hier einfach alles. Die Schauspieler sind gut, die Handlung klar und die Story ein wenig verrckt. Super eben.",1284076800,,223,5.054054054054054
8249399,5,B00136W7E2,The movie picks up on most of Nats habits and ways .It's the same as in most of the family. The story line goes out of bounds (stretches the truth a little)on some of the story line . I don't think Nat would stay living in a cave in the winter.  But what do I know? All the family's quirks are true right down to Blueskin(a true story)and George Washington. Animal rescue league(in Loudoun) is family as well. Some justice is caried out .,1269648000,2,438,4.214285714285714
8249400,4,B00136W7E2,"This is a wonderful film that you would enjoy.  It is based on a real person and the old homestead is a REAL and fascinating place.  The photography of northern Virginia is  beautiful, and the story is charming.  The locations used all exist, including the little sandwich shop and the Goose Creek Bridge, which can be viewed from Route 50.  Three cheers for a film that is not the usual Hollywood flashy or violent epic.  No obscene language requires a restrictive rating.  Just good, clean fun!",1217894400,3,496,4.6976744186046515
8249401,5,B00136W7E2,"I give this one a 9.  That's a rating that makes all my friends immediately buy or rent it to see.

  Roger Rees is an 8th generation Virginian.  Crushing debt is forcing him to sell his homeplace.  The young couple who offer to buy the house and farm seem to be as good a solution to the problems as one could hope for--they say that they will not demolish the old house, they will not subdivide the farm and put up McMansions on it, they'll keep Rees and his family on as caretakers and employ all those that Rees has had helping him.  We have their word on it.  He's a lawyer; she's a realtor.

  Yuppie scum.

  Nat (Rees) is forced to make the deal, but he can't bring himself to leave his homeplace.  While his wife and children move into town, he sets up residence in a cave near the river on the property.  Before it's all over, half the world seems to become involved.

  It's pure fantasy.  If only reality could be like this.  I love this movie, and it's going to be a personal favorite.

  The dialogue is excellent, the cinematography is luscious and wonderful, the acting (even by the yuppy scum) is perfect, the scenery is lovely.",1217721600,3,1145,4.317535545023697
8249402,5,B00136W7E2,"Rich, entertaining characters abound throughout this timely story and the stunning Virginia countryside west of Washington DC draws you near...but this 'little' film is so much more...In a world where capitalism and technology have outrun the collective spiritual conscious of the human race...this film will give you pause, stir your heart and inspire you to return to your spirit. A true delight!",1217548800,2,398,5.435483870967742
