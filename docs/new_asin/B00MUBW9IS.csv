6601934,5,B00MUBW9IS,"I really hate how catchy the tunes are as I'll start singing ""meow-moo, count by two"" even if I'm not around my kids, but they love it so I guess I'll manage.  It seems like Sesame Street kicked it up a notch from the first volume in terms of more involved story-lines but my sons ages 3.5 and 20 months are still very engaged. I was particularly impressed by the mini skip-counting lesson in the first episode.",1453766400,,411,4.337662337662338

6601939,5,B00MUBW9IS,"It's 5 episodes of elmo the musical. If your kids like that part of the show, they'll like this DVD. The episodes aren't any better or worse than others, to respond to the other review.",1440460800,,185,4.314285714285714
6601940,2,B00MUBW9IS,The first volume is much more entertaining than this one. These episodes (minus Mt. Everest) are fairly lame.,1436832000,,109,5.111111111111111

6601947,5,B00MUBW9IS,"My daughter loves the first elmo the musical so I wanted to get her the second one to have more of what she loves. This one is much more advanced with what shapes are called and numbers. She can't count and doesn't even know what a square is so counting to 20, cubes, and a rhombus can be rather confusing. At first she didn't like the video at all because of this, but now she dances and jumps when it comes on and sings with the 'kitty cows'.",1476144000,,444,4.056818181818182
