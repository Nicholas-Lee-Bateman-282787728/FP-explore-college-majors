Solid storytelling with a constant sense that something ""bad"" was going to happen. But never sure just what. It kept me guessing up until the final scenes - much like The Wicker Man. Burton is in top form and the supporting cast of boys are great to watch. Having been raised a Catholic - I found the story to be quite interesting, alot like ""I Confess"" by Hitchcock. And the tension builds as the story plays out - and one never knows what is truth and what is not. I enjoy movies like these - that keep you guessing and wondering where it's headed.

916644,1,6304703988,"Approximately the first half of this film was so boring that I considered turning it off several times, but I love Richard Burton and was intrigued by the premise. Also the fact that Amazon's description claimed the film is based on a true story kept me going (although it turns out, Amazon made that up; it is not a true story--as explained in the standard disclaimer at the end about the characters and storyline being fictional). The second half was mostly just absurd. And the ending literally did not make sense. ***Spoiler Alert***: This is what I mean about the ending. Character #1: I will go to the police and confess to the murder that I committed AND the murder you committed, so you can be off the hook and just turn your life around and become a good servant of God. Character #2: Wait, no, that's too easy on you--I don't want you to have the satisfaction of being a martyr. You have two choices--confess your murder to the police and rot in prison, or kill yourself, which is a mortal sin. Character #1: Aaggghhhhh! This is horrible! What ever will I do? You've taken away my first choice to confess to BOTH murders and rot in prison even longer!! Oh no!!! Also, how awful that  apparently I am required to do what you tell me to!

916768,4,6304703988,"""Absolution"" surprised me. I expected a boring melodrama with Richard Burton as a priest in a Catholic boy's school, but was pleasantly surprised with genuine creepiness and interesting plot developments.

Despite numerous scenes of Latin class and related academic pursuits, the film has an interesting storyline and some surprising developments. Burton makes the error of telling his students that anything said in confession can never be revealed, even to the police. This gives the boys an idea for a great practical joke at Burton's expense, but things turn ugly fast, first for a banjo-toting hippie, and later for others. The student under suspicion is cunning, perhaps even more cunning than Burton, and things rapidly spin out of control as Burton reaps an unexpected whirlwind.

Not all is as it seems, however. Part of the final plot point requires a suspension of disbelief, but overall the film has a haunted, harrowing feel that is rarely matched in psychological thrillers. Burton does occasionally give in to the temptation to overact, and the scenery chewing is contagious in the cast, particularly in the closing moments.

916772,3,6304703988,"Absolution, an English psychological thriller with a strong anti-religion subtext (a genre almost single handedly created by the film's screenwriter Anthony Shaffer with his far superior film The Whicker Man), was one of Richard Burton's final films.  After decades of heavy drinking and Liz Taylor, Burton, in his declining years, tended to show every sign of his lifestyle.  This was often to the detriment of the film's he was involved in and Absolution is no different.  In this film, Burton plays a rather niave, obviously repressed priest whose latent feelings for one of his students (Burton's character teaches Latin at a Catholic school) leaves him open to psychological manipulation.  However, one look at Burton's tired, blood-shot eyes and his ravaged face and its hard to buy Burton in the role.  Which is unfortunate because after years of contributing little to his performances beyond his famous voice, Burton actually does a pretty good job.  With the exception of a few over-the-top scenes at the end, Burton brings a subtle sense of anguish to a character that, otherwise, would have been totally unsympathetic.  In the film's best scenes, Burton suggests a great humanity underneath the priest's chilly surface and he makes the priest's sexual and later psychological torments quite believable.
The film's twisty plot is pure Shaffer -- a rigid, conservative system is thrown into chaos by the arrival of a liberating, almost pagan force (which, in a typical Shaffer twist, turns out to be as false as the establishment it destroys) and a great deal of senseless violence ensues.  In Absolution, that establishment is the Catholic Boys School where Richard Burton teaches and dotes on one student (Dominic Guard) to an uncomfortable degree.  That pagan force shows up as a bearded, Scottish drifter and theif (comedian Billy Connolly) who camps out in the countryside outside the school and ends up befriending Guard and leading the youth away from Burton and religion in general.  (One of the film's flaws is that Guard's drastic transformation from good Catholic boy to Pagan prankster comes far too quickly.)  Eventually, under Connolly's suggestion, Guard starts to tell Burton elaborate stories of sin during confession -- tormenting the priest with information that, as a priest, Burton is not allowed to share with anyone else.  Eventually, what started as a joke spirals out of control into a vortex of murder, madness, and a surprise ending that comes out of nowhere but remains a lot of fun nonetheless.
Poorly directed by TV vet Anthony Page, the film's main appeal is to be found in its script and cast.  Though not up to Shaffer's best work, Absolution -- especially early on -- displays a good deal of his stringent wit and he does a good enough job of keeping the story moving quickly enough that its not obvious just how ludicrous much of it is. He's helped by strong performances from his principles.  Billy Connolly is likeable in a performance that'll surprise Americans who know him only as Howard Hesseman's replacement on Head of the Class.  Andrew Kier, the final Prof. Quartermass, is a welcome presence as the school's head master while, as the two most distinctive students, Dominic Guard and David Bradley give nicely nuanced turns that alternate between youthful innocence and enigmatic slyness.  Both Guard and Bradley were former child stars and both pretty much vanished from the screen following their performances in this film.
In the end, however, this is Burton's film and, even if miscast, he still gives an admirable performance that provides a much needed anchor to Shaffer's plot.  Its a reminder -- after years of appearing in such claptrap as The Klansman and the Exorcist sequel, that Burton truly could be a good actor.  This performance and his final turn in 1984 both suggest that, in his later years, Burton was finally ready to start acting again.  Its difficult not to regret that he didn't get more chances to remind us of just how good he could be.",1007942400,13,4018,5.024096385542169

7876398,3,6304703988,"Review of Absolution
Hot Toasty Rag, July 20, 2017

Richard Burton plays a priest in Absolution. I know, his real-life persona was very un-priest-like, but thats why its called acting! I mean, Frank Sinatra played a very convincing priest in The Miracle of the Bells, and he was just as un-saintly as Richard Burton in real life. Anyway, Burton gives a great performance as a man of the cloth. Hes conflicted and pained, and when he even hears about a sin, you can see him struggling not to take it as a personal insult.

Hes a teacher and mentor in a boys Catholic school, and during one of his lessons, the boys ask about the rules during confession. If someone confesses to a crime, will the priest turn him into the police? Burton answers, almost directly into the camera for the audiences benefit, that the priest is bound to silence and cant call the police if hes told of a crime. Then, surprise! One of his students confesses a murder.

Granted, if this movie had been made today, it would be a lot more gruesome, and probably have a few more twists and turns. But it was made in 1978, and so if you watch it, keep that in mind. There are a couple of violent scenes, but nothing overly graphic. And I thought it was thrilling, with enough twists and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat. Its a lot of fun to watch a manipulative, snot-nosed student take Burton to the brink of insanity!",1500508800,,1397,4.386100386100386
7876399,3,6304703988,"Absolution seems like it has a novel screaming to come out of the movie.  It's a decent story.  I like the twisted ending and unexpected plot turns even if they sometimes feel a bit convoluted.  It has pretty good characters and is decently acted.  Its primary downfall is in taking so long to get to the suspense.

At the center is a Catholic boarding school for boys.  Benjy is a promising young man until he befriends a drifter camping in the woods (Billy Connolly who would later play a fallen priest in X Files: I Want to Believe). Benjy's new friend suggests that it might be fun to play a prank on Father Goddard.  The priest has been Benjy's mentor, but that doesn't stop the boy from confessing fabricated sins of sexual misconduct and murder to him.

When Father Goddard discovers the deception he is reluctant to believe the next tale of murder, but the corpse he finds leads him to take threats made against other schoolboys seriously especially when one of them goes missing.

The trap is this: since the misdeeds were told to him during confessions he is forbidden to divulge any of the information.  He is tormented by what he knows and what he feels is his inability to do anything about it.  It's a kind of battle of wills with the priest's well-intentioned vows being used against him.

I'm not Catholic so I don't know that much about the nature of confessions.  Is a priest really so tightly bound to silence if he believes lives are at risk?  Conversations with Catholic friends reveal that to not be the case in real life, but even if that's not entirely true it's presented as fact in the movie so I guess what's important is that Father Goddard BELIEVES it to be so.  The movie does a fairly good job of creating a sense of desperate frustration in him.

We spend a lot of time early on getting introduced to the school, its inhabitants, and the drifter.  We spend a lot of time in classes and study sessions.  The suspense begins late with the instigation of the first minor prank and then builds slowly towards the lives of schoolboys being at risk.  It does finally pick up steam, but a stronger ambiance through the first portion would have helped a lot.

As the suspense builds in that last portion it culminates in the kind of twisted revelation scene you might expect from a mystery movie  the Sherlock-Holmes-explains-the-solution kind of scene.  Depending on how the story strikes you the revelations could be convoluted or confusing, but I found them mostly interesting and satisfying though some parts of the plot could stand to be less convoluted.

I enjoyed the actors.  Father Goddard (Richard Burton) is particularly well played.  The parts of the students (some might recognize David Bradley) and the drifter (Billy Connolly) are well done.  I wasn't as impressed with some of the supporting cast, but their contributions are small.

Content:
Im surprised to find this is rated R. There is one brutal scene of violence, but all other violence is implied. Benjy confesses some sexual and violent acts, but these discussions are not particularly graphic or vulgar. There is very little of anything else questionable.

DVD:
I got mine in a 50 pack of Drive-In Movie Classics.  The audio is thin but clear with some white noise that becomes more noticeable in the quieter scenes.  The image has very weak colors and is sometimes fuzzy.  A Mill Creek logo appears periodically as if coming to confess sins to you.  There are no extras.

Im shocked to find this available on Blu-ray from Kino from whom I have gotten other well-done editions of old movies. There is no question that this is going to be a superior presentation to anything else Ive seen on the market and offers some minor extras. Im considering getting this and will revisit this review if I do. There are plenty of DVD editions and at least a few other multi-movie packs. I didn't see anything to suggest any of those offer anything special. I didn't see a Kino DVD.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I didn't expect to like Absolution as much as I do. As bad as my copy is I couldn't resist watching it more than once. But while story and acting get thumbs up the lack of ambiance for such a large part of the movie hold it back a lot, not to mention the poor technical qualities that sometimes come with such an obscure, older film.  I say absolutely check it out, but don't spend much on it unless you know for sure you're getting decent quality. Virtually anything is going to be better than Drive-In Movie Classics if only because of that goofy watermark, but the more I talk about it the more I want to see Kinos Blu-ray transfer. 3* (for now).",1496620800,,4635,4.604141291108404
