327909,4,630135964X,"My son with autism saw this movie on You Tube. I searched so many places for it and had no luck.  He is happy to have this movie on VHS, although the tape has a few messed up spots in it.  Overall, it's a very good value for the price.  I only wish I could have found it on DVD.",1270771200,3,278,3.6
327910,4,630135964X,"I watched this movie as a child, probably when I was around 4 or 5 years old. I loved it! I loved whales and would have my parents rewind it again and again. But, having gone back and seen it as an adult, I must say that it is quite dark. Small children may be scared (or may not even notice like me), but be advised that this movie is from the perspective of the whales, and often depicts humans as evil. You will have to determine whether you believe your child will see it as a wonderful movie about whales, or be frightened by it. As an adult, you'll catch a lot of the underlying plot. In case you want some insight on the movie (spoilers alert):

*Three or four whales die in various ways, including oil and harpoon.

*Two walrus eat toxic fish and lose their tusks.

*And there are other allusions to mankinds foolishness. For example, towards the end of the movie, Samson (main character) finds Moby Dick, but when he is told that he can't help him and Samson swims away, he swims out of New York City, obviously alluding to the global warming issue. You will catch this, but your little kid won't.

This film also doesn't have the happy resolve that Disney has spoiled us with. It doesn't have a sad ending, but there isn't a happy ""all is well moment"".

But, like I said, as a kid, I loved it. As an adult I think it's very well done and I would still watch just because I'm obsessed with whales. If your kid likes whales and isn't terribly effected by cartoon whales dying or things like that, then I say get it. But, if you're a little worried, then I would choose something else for them, like the Free Willy cartoon series (which I also loved)which isn't on amazon, but you can find by googling.

Hope this review helped!",1248566400,10,1735,4.306748466257669
327911,5,630135964X,"I first saw this movie when I was around seven or eight...I loved whales (after falling in love with Free Willy), and loved this movie as well. However, after watching it several years later, I discovered that there are some scary moments that come with all old cartoons...might not be approrpriate for young kids (some scary images and depicting man as a beast). But for its age, this movie has great animation and a fantastic story. If you like whales and a good movie, buy/rent this movie.",1143590400,2,492,4.666666666666667
327912,5,630135964X,"I watched this movie on vacation and it totally blew me away! I mean wow! The animation for this movie is great to start with. The story is also very deep and touching. I was deeply moved. Not only that, but the script is ingeniusly written. There are also great songs that had me and my whole family singing along. If you like good movies, buy this!",1087603200,,350,4.2388059701492535
327913,4,630135964X,"I remember my mom renting this movie for me when I was around 6 years old. Since I love whales I was very delighted. This movie however did not make me happy really. It made me cry and it scared me when Samson searched for Moby Dick and found him all old and wrinkly. While the movie is very good and I do love it despite the fact it made me cry sometimes, I only give it 4 stars because it made me cry and scared me somewhat. But I definitly want this in my DVD collection. So please Amazon or whoever is in charge of DVDs release this great film on DVD so I can relive my childhood!",1070755200,,584,3.9159663865546217
327914,5,630135964X,"When I was young I used to watch this movie so often. My mom had to rent it for me so many times that we had to buy it from the video store. It really teaches kids a lesson in compassion, that is what I got out of it, and even to this day I still remember it. I still have the video too. It is not for every kid, but for any child who loves animals I would highly recommend it.",1049932800,,377,3.6097560975609757
327915,4,630135964X,"I used to watch this all the time when I was young. I loved it. It was a great movie and if you love whales, you need to watch it. Even though the title says, ""Song of whale"" I don't recall any singing or sing alongs in it.",939427200,,223,3.6666666666666665
327916,2,630135964X,"""Samson and Sally"" is a dark film that will worry and disturb more sensitive viewers.  All the problems that Samson faces and tries to correct remain unresolved in the end.  Our daughter (who is 8 and is  obsessed with anything to do with whales) loves this film, but we have been  disturbed about the lack of resolution and the total depressivness of this  film. It seems like a movie cooked up by Greenpeace, but with an even more  somber note.",938044800,4,446,4.5125

7811493,4,630135964X,"OK, this film is a liiiiiiiiitle on the adult theme side but that's what I love about the animated movies I grew up with. Nobody worried about themes that would offend people, (as long as there wasn't anything raunchy in it) just told the story to the fullest even if it was a little dark.",1416355200,,289,4.2727272727272725

7811496,5,630135964X,My son had this movie when he was small. he's 27 now. I bought this for his children.  Both my son and I have fond memories of this movie. It has subtle messages about the dangers of polluting our planet. My grandchildren watch it often. They are 4 and 5,1371168000,2,254,4.08
