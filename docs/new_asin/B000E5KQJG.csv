2492912,1,B000E5KQJG,"For years I was intrigued by the title and poster for this film, with its outrageous title--NIGHT OF A THOUSAND CATS. I see it has been awkwardly retitled NIGHT OF A 1,000 CATS for this DVD release. I am fond of the idea of cat horror films, although one can count the good ones on one hand and have fingers left over.

When my wife (also a horror fan and cat lover) and finally got a chance to own a copy on VHS, we were prepared for some goofy fun along the lines of Ted V. Mikels's THE CORPSE GRINDERS or the TV movie STRAYS. No such luck. There is very little cat action. The felines take a backseat to the serial killer flying endlessly in his helicopter.

Also there is little gore, nudity, or even ridiculous dialog to hold one's attention. Just over an hour, it feels like it goes on for days. If you must spend your time on a Rene Cardona film, BEAKS  is more satisfying. At least it has some characters and some bird attacks and an unintentionally absurd mood.

Oh yes, the box art on this DVD looks very nice from what I can see online.",1328486400,2,1047,4.1940298507462686
2492913,5,B000E5KQJG,"A playboy picks up women, takes them to his get-away and then later turns them into cat food. The first to get it is Christa, played by Christa Linder who was Miss Austria 1962. Dorgo, the creepy bald butler was excellently portrayed by Gerardo Zepeda, long time actor with 137 movie credits to his name. Abraham Cruz, one of my favorite sound editors knows something about music as he brings us a fine combination of 50-70's soundtrack bites. He is experienced with 81 films, who would you rather have? Hugo Stiglitz stars as Hugo, the playboy who picks up women. With 224 movie titles to his credit including ""Zombie Apocalypse"" (1985), Nightmare City (1980) it is historical to see one of his earlier creations. Written, directed and produced by the great Ren Cardona Jr. (98 film credits) he would later team up with other members of this extraordinary cast to make ""The Treasure of the Amazon"" (1985)!

Hugo cruises the city in his helicopter looking for chicks the way a teen cruises the town in an old Ford. For mental stimulation Hugo plays Dorgo in chess and I don't think either one knows anything about the game. With 4 badly placed black pieces on the board, Hugo is able to ""checkmate"" Dorgo, who has at least 4 moves to get out of it. In one scene Hugo tosses a rope ladder out of his helicopter expecting a woman to just climb on in. What I really enjoyed were the muscle machines everyone drove in this film. To be honest, I have never seen a pride of kittens hunt and kill in a pack. Just an amazing movie all around. 5 stars on the MST 3000 scale.

Sex, Brief Nudity (Christa Linder) WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WATCH UNLESS IN AN ALTERED STATE. TO BE VIEWED BY EXPERIENCED ILLICIT MATERIAL USERS ONLY!",1321228800,5,1719,4.52411575562701
2492914,3,B000E5KQJG,"A sophisticated international playboy named Hugo spends his days flying around in his helicopter, looking for beautiful women to take home. Home for Hugo is an ancient monastary, complete w/ bald, Tor Johnson-like servant Dorgo, a trophy room full of pickled human heads, and a pit of 1000 (give or take) ferocious house-felines. Once there, Hugo seduces, kills, and grinds his girlfriends into kitty-chow. At only 63 minutes, NIGHT OF 1000 CATS zips along, even w/ WAY too much padding in the form of seemingly endless helicopter flights. However, it is pretty funny to see Hugo hovering 6"" above a prospective victim's swimming pool! Very subtle! Macabre and goofy, NO1KC is another  wacky 70s relic...",1237507200,2,704,5.121739130434783
2492915,1,B000E5KQJG,"This film goes nowhere. There is no blood, no nudity, no weirdness...

absolutely nothing that describes this as a 70s horror film. There is

hardly any dialogue and great part of the film are just shots of a

helicopter and bad seventys instrumental music. The few girls in the

film are beautiful, but considering that it was a horror film and it

was the 70s, there should have been more skin shown, at least to

justify for the poor story line and bad acting.

This film is nowhere close to any other 70s horror gems. Another factor

that disappointed me was that the movie is all spoken in English. Since

the title is La Noche de los Mil Gatos, I thought it was going to be

spoken in Spanish, so that took away my interest since the beginning.

I do not recommend to serious horror film buffs.",1159747200,7,800,4.374149659863946

8105994,3,B000E5KQJG,"This is the short version of the film (only 63 minutes).  I saw it broadcast on Spanish-language television and it was much longer.
This is the only DVD I own.  I use it for testing purposes to make sure DVD drives work.  It is fit for purpose.",1433030400,,244,4.148936170212766
8105995,5,B000E5KQJG,OMG... I love this movie. I don't know why the guy has a room full of cats but who cares... he's a creepy rich guy that stalk women on a helicopter (yes he stalks them while flying) so a room of cats is typical for his craziness... I love the story and wish there was more like this (or maybe something I should be rewriting in the near future),1425859200,,344,4.0

8105998,3,B000E5KQJG,"This production is really more for Hugo Stiglitz and Ren Cardona Jr. fans because it's not at all a ""good"" horror film. Thankfully the sheer oddity of it all makes it a fun viewing. The quality of the transfer is pretty poor but still watchable, which probably won't matter much if you're just looking to check it out. I liked the concept, was relatively impressed with the FX and Anjanette Comer was stunning so I decided to give it 3 stars. People unfamiliar with cult cinema may find this a bit boring and repetitive, which is understandable, but it's definitely recommended to trash cinema collectors.",1374019200,,605,4.771428571428571
8105999,4,B000E5KQJG,"Not the greatest movie ever made by far, but i felt this was a good movie overall.

  We have a wealthy Playboy who flies a helicopter around picking up chicks and taking them to his secluded estate which is an old abandon monastery.  He happens to have a pit filled with cats and they do get hungry....
  Not gory by any means and special effects amount to some well done severed heads.  The movie relies heavily on the acting and story - which are both done rather well.  A horror collector may like this for their collection due to it's offbeat concept, though may not satisfy more than other horror films... it is good for a rainy day.",1369526400,4,639,4.3559322033898304
8106000,3,B000E5KQJG,"The plot was interesting but poor production values kept my rating to 3 stars.
Someone could expand this idea into a great horror movie,
perhaps with Lovecraftian overtures.",1359849600,2,173,5.214285714285714
