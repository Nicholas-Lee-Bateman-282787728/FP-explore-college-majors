8073944,4,B000A3DFS6,"this is not a Hollywood film, but you will not feel cheated by the price you pay, in fact after watching the download, you will seriously consider buying a copy for later.  It is quirky, funny, off-beat serious, and out of touch with reality, yet some how it is very easy to identify with the main characters and hope that they come out winning. However, if you are one of those people who have to have it in english and can not read subtitles, i would pass.  if you are the other type.... just enjoy the movie!",1296864000,3,511,4.257731958762887
8073945,5,B000A3DFS6,"Sergio Cabrera in my opinion is the greatest director to come out of Colombian cinema. In ""Perder Es Cuestion De Metodo"" he manages to deliver yet another stunning visual portrait of Bogota in all its flawed beauty. The film also delivers a sobering insight into the corruption at all levels of society and the copasetic way in which Colombians go about dealing with it. If anyone is curious as to how a Colombian mind operates and thinks, this will certainly give you an idea of the general attitudes and psychological issues that comes from living in what at one point was the most violent country in the world. Another film thats definitely worth watching as far as a real portrayal of Bogota is ""La Estrategia Del Caracol"" by the same director.",1272326400,8,748,4.717557251908397
8073946,4,B000A3DFS6,"Muestra la realidad de un pais que estaba undido en el ampa y la corrupcion, hoy en dia no se puede decir que esto se ha eliminado por completo pero si ha mejorado bastante",1206057600,3,172,4.088235294117647
8073947,5,B000A3DFS6,"A Colombian Film. Most of the times, people have previous ideas when they hear the name of the country.

Well this film is not a happy one, but what you see will surprise you. A reporter, his work and how love could arrive in a form you're not expecting. The crude reality.

In my concept a really good film, recomended.",1189296000,11,320,4.316666666666666
8073948,5,B000A3DFS6,"En esta pelicula Sergio Cabrera nor muestra nuevamente porque es uno de los mejores directores colombianos del momento. baso en el libro de Santiago Gamboa, es un reflejo de un pais donde macondo y las situaciones ridiculas son algo de todos los dias",1137542400,11,250,4.837209302325581
