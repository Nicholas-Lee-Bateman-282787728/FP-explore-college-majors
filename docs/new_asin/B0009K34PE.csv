8062323,2,B0009K34PE,"As much I like Cherry Mirage, this was a routine adult film with the moaning and groaning sounding fake. The one stand-out scene in Our Story is the girl-girl action between Cherry Mirage and Chandler. The dialogue between Cherry and Chris Cannon, they were playing a couple in this movie, was laughably cheesy. There weren't a lot of extras in the DVD: just the slideshow and some of the pictures were out of focus. And there didn't seem to be any direction in the plot: It was supposed to be about political turbulence of the 1960's but then the storyline was abruptly dropped after the first scene and the rest of the film magically forwarded to the 1990's for no apparent reason.",1353196800,,683,4.60655737704918
