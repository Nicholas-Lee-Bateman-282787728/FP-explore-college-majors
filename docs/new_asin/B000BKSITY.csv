2422707,3,B000BKSITY,"It seems to promulgate two time-worn 60's myths.

The first is that American military forces performed poorly, overall that is.  The second is that the protest movement, across all American society, as well as on this one college campus, was the voice of American youth, maybe even society as a whole.

Both were/are categorically wrong.

American military forces in Vietnam performed, overall, very well, causing severe losses to NVA and VC.  Exceptions exist of course.  It would be interesting to obtain all combat unit diaries/histories for Oct 67 to see if any had success, or at least no mauling.  I suspect the author (or maybe a research asst.)  went thru these very diaries/histories for Oct 67 and found one that was a severe (American) loss, and that on the same (or adjacent??) day as this U. of W. campus riot.  Makes for a better story if on same/adjacent day.

As to the campus riot by student protesters.  They certainly did not represent society's view of the conflict in Vietnam;  far from it.  They did not even represent many of the students found on college campuses across America, very far from it.  The student's who did ""show up"" at protests were largely attracted by  the music being played there, hope of intoxification (""weed"", booze) and as many enticeingly dressed females as could be possibly obtained.  Not the political content.

Let's be honest, that generation was no more politically aware than any other, before or since.  They had their heads up their butts to the same degree just like any other youth in human history.  They were being incited by agitators who wanted to be seen as more numerous than they really were.  The Leftist dominated news/entertainment media, as well as education institutions, knew this but did not make that public at the time.

These two 60's myths were routinely presented by academia/news/entertainment, all utterly dominated by political LEFT, throughout the 60's, 70's, 80's and beyond.  No serious challenge was allowed to that (LEFTIST) viewpoint.  Those student protesters, incited by agitators, received a voice in the news media far beyond what their numbers, or fraction of society's population, deserved.  Nowadays, with three new media (radio, internet, cable TV) these fictions will be debunked rather quickly.  Hence, it is necessary to insinuate them.  Is there any surprise this was made by PBS?

I know I am making a subjective judgement about what the author of the book, from which this comes, is getting across.  But he (Maraniss) is in all likelihood passing off two, tired old myths from that time.  He wouldn't dare claim them as truths in this day and age.

Just remember those two when watching this program.  It's entertaining, well made, and instructional in it's own way (shows LEFTIST bias still alive and well, just more subtle).",1346716800,11,2827,4.989293361884369
2422708,5,B000BKSITY,"I learned of this book from another Vietnam veteran at the VA in Freeport IL. He shared it with me, at least what it was about. Living in Wisconsin most of my life I was surprised that the University action took place in Madison WI. I really did not realize this was going on at the time. When the science lab was blown up and a researcher was killed, that got my attention. I was a high school junior and finishing up my last football season. By March 24, 1968 I had enlisted in the
Marine Corps and within a year I was in Vietnam neck first. This book has brought back many memories of the time and what I was involved in when this all happened. No I have not seen the video yet. However, I am betting it is well done. I am anxious to share this film with our local history teacher as he has me speak to his senior class about the war. All of this will come in rather handy. I will share it with them also.",1335484800,9,908,3.9945054945054945

2422712,5,B000BKSITY,"I have just finished a discussion with my undergraduate ""History of the Vietnam War"" class about TWO DAYS IN OCTOBER, which they watched the day following my lecture on ""Search & Destroy: Westmoreland's Big-Unit War."" The discussion was the best we have had in this class. The connections that TWO DAYS makes between the conduct of the war in Vietnam and the rise of the campus-based radical antiwar movement make this film essential viewing.  TWO DAYS provides a rare glimpse into the life of the Regular Army, including interviews with the wife of the late LTC Terry de la Mesa Allen, Jr., as well as Delta Co. CO Welch, and First Sgt. Barrow. My students finally got to see what a real NCO looked and sounded like by watching ""Top"" Barrow's interview. But TWO DAYS also provides a look into the emerging antiwar movement (Professor Zeitlin, now a Distinguished Professor at UCLA, Paul Soglin of Madison, Wisc., et al.) and gave my students an understanding of why that generation's belief in ""civic duty"" drove them to the antiwar movement in the late 1960s.  Now, this wasn't easy for me: in addition to being a history professor I am a combat veteran of Vietnam-Cambodia (Apr. 1970-Mar. 1971), serving with ""Cold Steel Alpha,"" 2/7 Cav. First Cav. Division (Airmobile). Some things in the PBS production almost drove me to tears, but that is a good thing. As a teacher of history, I heartily recommend this American Experience production for classroom use.

2422713,5,B000BKSITY,"I was seven years old when these events occurred (although, at the time, I recall having the attitude espoused by the leader of the Black Lions (I was raised in a conservative area)).  There are many fascinating facets to this film, but two hit me hardest:  1.  The gung-ho, obviously exceptionally capable  leader of the Black Lions and how the higher-ups abused/took advantage of this (and his troops') ability and dedication to have their own tickets punched to advance their careers and 2. The domestic authorities' mischaracterization of the causal factor of the student riot in Wisconsin.  You really could NOT trust those in authority!  Great weaving of interviews, including with the leader of the NVA ambush.  Be sure to watch the extra tracts.  Louis J Sheehan",1195430400,5,770,5.0078740157480315
2422714,5,B000BKSITY,"I was a high school junior in Wisconsin, 90 miles from Madison, at the time of the ""two days"" covered by this film.  Today I'm a high school history teacher in Ohio, and the next time I teach my semester elective on the Vietnam War era, I'm going to use this film as the opening exercise.  It contains more truth about the war than I've seen in any other single presentation.  It's not just about the Black Lions, not just about the UW protesters, not just about the war's politics, not just about the Vietnamese.  Everybody's there-even the Madison police-everybody gets to speak, they're all presented fairly.

The film is based on David Maraniss' THEY MARCHED INTO SUNLIGHT, which tells the same stories, and a great many others, in far more depth.  But given the constraints of a 90-minute video presentation, TWO DAYS IN OCTOBER is outstanding.  With its use of vintage TV clips juxtaposed with modern-day interviews of the participants, it creates immediacy at the same time it gives the witnesses a chance to reflect on events decades past.  I looked hard for bias, and didn't find any-although it's clear the film is a Rohrschach ink blot test.  What you see in it depends on what you bring to it.  So I'll mention what I bring to it:  the perception that the higher-ups in Vietnam and Madison were in a fortress of denial, that they refused to accept the evidence of their own eyes.  The Black Lions were victims of an ambush because an overzealous commander ordered them to advance when he shouldn't have, but Gen. Westmoreland couldn't admit it, even to himself.  The violence at the U. of Wisconsin was perpetrated mainly by the police, who thus made a touchy situation worse, but the state legislators staged public hearings to blame the students and Chancellor Sewell because they couldn't own up to reality.

Other sources which deal with some of the same subject matter as TWO DAYS IN OCTOBER are the protester-friendly video THE WAR AT HOME (1979) and Tom Bates' moderate/conservative nonfiction account RADS (1992), about Madison's underground bombers. Both of them describe the Dow Day violence as part of larger stories.

I connect the authorities' penchant for denial to an anecdote that appears in THEY MARCHED INTO SUNLIGHT, but not in the film.  In 1967, current Vice President Dick Cheney was a graduate student in Madison.  Maraniss quotes him as dismissing the student protests as a distraction and a waste of time.  Apparently Cheney was too busy with ""other priorities"" to learn anything at the UW that would have prevented him from leading our country into the current quagmire in Iraq.  (And he's still in denial about the existence of WMD.)  What a difference it might have made if only he had actually gotten himself educated about the difficulty of fighting insurgents or the dangers of plunging our soldiers into an unnecessary war.

For a quick encapsulation of America in Vietnam, there's nothing better than TWO DAYS IN OCTOBER.",1131408000,51,2966,4.856858846918489
2422715,5,B000BKSITY,"Amazingly, this one documentary captures the essence of what most of America was feeling at the time about our involvement in the Vietnam war.

  There are interviews with soldiers who fought, protestors who stood up to the establishment and big business, policemen who were told to stop the protestors, family members who were at home while their loved-ones were in Vietnam and even Viet Cong leaders involved in the same battle as the US soldiers being intervewed. All of these people having ties in some way or another with each other.

  This is masterfully combined with footage throughout the show, as the incidents are being recounted.

  I was flipping the channels when I ran across this documentary not long after it began and I was immediately riveted, so much so that I couldn't even bring myself to..ahem..use the facilities till it was over.

Get this DVD and you will have a good idea of how much of the US felt and still feel about the war in Vietnam. Amazing.",1129680000,31,976,4.72189349112426
2422716,5,B000BKSITY,"This was an extremely powerful documentary with parallel stories of the Vietnam War and a protest at the University of Wisconsin.  The production of the film is outstanding,  capturing the emotions and opposing opinions of the U.S. presence in Vietnam told through recent interviews of people who experienced it half a world away from each other.  I believe they fairly represented the two perspectives with powerful, interviews from those who clearly still have scars from this war, regardless of their stance in 1967.

8088012,5,B000BKSITY,"I read the about this film while doing some research for the high school Wisconsin History class I teach. I got a copy from the public library and was amazed. It is a gripping look at two series of events happening worlds apart. A peaceful protest against DOW Chemical on the University of Wisconsin campus spirals out of control as student protesters class with Madison police. In Vietnam, units of the US First Infantry stumble into a bloody ambush. The film switches back and forth seamlessly from Madison to Vietnam and from footage from 1967 with present day interviews with the participants. This is the second year in a row that I have shown this at the end of the year in Wisconsin History and most of the students (all HS freshmen) got caught up in the film. It was even better when I was able to have a substitute teacher who was a UW-Madison student during the protests come and talk to the class.

8088015,5,B000BKSITY,"What a matching of stunning coincidence. That this violent firefight and this violent anti-war demonstration both occurred on the same days with polar opposite outcomes for the armed force that was badly outnumbered is truly a breathtaking accideent of history. While I still resent and am unable to forgive the anti-war demonstrators, nevertheless, I can understand the drive of their strongly held beliefs that resulted in this clash.

That Westmoreland was singularly responsible for this catastrophe to my brothers in arms is badly understated in this documentary. Westmoreland was absolutely incompetent and should have been relieved of command 4 years before he was relieved. The US Marines were spot on in tactics and strategy from the get-go. If the commanding general of the Marines in South Vietnam were placed in charge of MACV, the war would have been won and South Vietnam would be a viable nation state today. The only other thing that should have been done is for the combined US Armed Forces to compel the military of South Vietnam to hold the long promised national elections, with the US Armed Forces supervising the entire campaigning and election to ensure that a free and democratic election was held and a proper head of state and an equally powerful legislature along with an equally powerful judiciary was installed. With the US providing the muscle to conquer the Viet Cong and the territory that was gained so that the farmers could go about their business without being murdered in their sleep would have been the answer to the war and incursions into Cambodia, Laos and North Vietnam exercised as needed to stop the Interference of the North in the internal affairs of South Vietnam.

I realize that this review goes beyond the scope of the documentary, but when the documentary alludes to Westmoreland's incompetence, it should have been more overt and frankly explained what it meant about why he was incompetent and why this led to the anti-war movement. That is my only bone to pick with this documentary. But it is nevertheless an excellent documentary on two stunning coincidences of history, comparing and contrasting both. That is why it gets five stars, in my opinion. An essential addition to any proper Vietnam library.",1385251200,3,2258,5.03475935828877

The great thing about this documentary is that it is very palatable for a younger viewer, as it does not inundate them with too much information, but yet it still captures the most important aspects of the war.

Information is presented in a fair and balanced manner, which is very hard to find concerning documentaries on the Vietnam War.

American Experience has done it again. Great work!!

As a suggestion, I recommend the book They Marched Into Sunlight for more information on the vietnam War. This documentary is based off of the book. I have not completed the book, but what I have read is superb as well.",1357948800,4,825,4.516778523489933
