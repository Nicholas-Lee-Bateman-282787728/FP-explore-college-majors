8542164,5,B009J2VM3O,"I don't know about you, but the Summer Olympic Games 2012 in London looked to me like a great place to be.  While I greatly enjoyed watching the games and the closing ceremonies from my couch thousands of miles away, how cool would it have been to actually be there in person?  As an American fan of Blur, I get their talent, impact, and appeal somewhat, but not like the British do.  When you take a band I am a mild fan of, add in the fresh post-Olympics vibe, utilize top notch audio and video technology, suddenly I feel like I am there, in the middle of the excitement with the band and all the thousands upon thousands of joyous fans.  And joyous is a good word to describe what I get when I watch Parklive.  It is a fantastic showcase of a truly great band coming together to demonstrate the best of their talents and abilities in a close to ideal setting.

Check out some of the clips available from various on-line sources first if you have any doubts, but from the get-go, this is one musically brilliant set in a truly alive and vibrant setting that can take the viewer/listener immediately off the couch and into a moment in time that is well worth remembering and reliving, even if you couldn't be there in person.",1361404800,,1227,4.383259911894273
