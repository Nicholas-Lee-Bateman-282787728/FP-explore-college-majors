8462254,4,B0058TZ544,"This 2009 second series isn't the best drama from the BBC but it's still more interesting than most TV fare.  Suranne Jones (Scott & Bailey); David Morrissey (State of Play, Blackpool); Anne Reid (Last Tango in Halifax) give good performances.  No subtitles and episodes must be played separately.",1442966400,,297,5.166666666666667
8462255,3,B0058TZ544,"The British certainly have their approach to things and have been successful in many of their crime dramas. Though maybe not their best, this second installment in the series is still worth watching.

Here's the scoop. A baby is left abandoned in a hospital bathroom. A person commits suicide, or is murdered, by jumping off a bridge into an oncoming train. Are they connected? There are other sub-plots but they involve people attached to these two plots.

This starts out very well. You have the incidents and the subsequent police investigation. You meet the primary characters involved, and people to whom they are attached, so you get the story from several angles simultaneously. The stories are juggled well as the clues build and other dramas unfold. One of the primary investigators is a female so the social complications involved are examined. Many of the other principals involved are Muslim so the socio-political implications involved are examined in reasonable depth. This is a very socially conscious endeavor.

There are five episodes, each taking place over a 24 hour period, but the overall span of time is over 102 days. This is where it falters. In the final episode things, important things, get dropped or rounded up in casual fashion. The investigation, which comprises much of the first four episodes, ceases to amount to anything. Certain characters that are built up early on cease to be of any impact. Other things that start out as side shows end up taking on focus. It gets real schizoid in the end.

This is acted and directed well. I liked the musical score a lot and all the other production aspects are of a professional level. It just seemed to stumble all over the place at the end.",1340755200,2,1718,4.853242320819112
