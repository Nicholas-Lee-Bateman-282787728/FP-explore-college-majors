8763194,5,B01GMC9M1C,"Concussion, 2015 film

In September 2002 there is a trial. A physician in emergency medicine testifies. He specializes in neuro-pathology and has a list of accomplishments. He testifies about a defendant who has hemophilia and could not have been an attacker. Back at the hospital he treats patients - as a medical examiner. Dr. Cyril Wecht is in charge, he has another case for Dr. Omalu. At church he is told about a young woman from Kenya who needs shelter. A man is taken to the hospital (he used to be famous). Mike wants help. His death creates news. Dr. Bennet Omalu works on the corpse. The CT scan is six months old. The medical record has the complaints. There is a problem over costs. The brain if fixed and sectioned. He finds something! Later he watches a football game. Players are told to be violent. [Like the gladiators of Rome?] He watches football players in person. An expert looks at the specimens. The human brain isn't protected against shocks like some birds.

Hits affected Mikes brain, like other players in football. Can this condition be given a name? This discovery will be published in a medical journal. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy or CTE is the name for this disease. Elsewhere another ex-football player suffers from a medical condition; he dies in a crash. The published report causes concerns in New York City and an attack on Dr. Omalu! The NFL is a big and powerful corporation that acts to defend its business. Dr. Omalu said Terry had the same condition. There will be more cases. Dr. Omalu gets a telephone threat; also more background news about deaths. This condition does not show up on a CT scan, only after death. An ex-football player complains about his problem, but it not helped. His suicide is in the news. A team doctor does anything to keep them in the game; its business. Football is the most popular sport in America. [Their shows attract a lot of advertising dollars.] Dead men ruin their families.

As a young boy Dr. Omalu admired America. Omalus report is printed in a New York City newspaper. The NFL is an entertainment product. There is a meeting in Chicago over this question. But Dr. Omalu was dis-invited. This meeting was rigged to deny CTE: multiple injuries have no consequences. The FBI arrests Cyril Wecht MD JD over the use of expense accounts! Dr. Omalu is also threatened! Omalus wife is followed by a car, and suffers a miscarriage. They plan changes and move to California. There is the death of another ex-football player by suicide; his brain is donated to research.

Dr. Omalu speaks to an audience about TCE and its dangers. It is compared to smoking tobacco. The Chief Medical Examiner for Washington DC is an important official position. Will he take the job? No, he returned to California and his wife Prema and their two sons. In 2011 retired NFL players sued the League for concealing the dangers of concussion. It was settled on the condition they would keep secret what they knew. About 28% of football players will suffer from cognitive impairment. All the federal charges against Dr. Cyril Wecht were dismissed.

This is a very important and educational story. I never heard of this condition before, did you? The dangers of tobacco smoking were known before the connection to lung cancer, but only the effect of nicotine on the heart. Should children and teenagers be encouraged to engage in football? Heading the ball in soccer also has dangers. Is this condition found in other sports? But do they attract viewers and advertising dollars like football? Basketball doesnt need helmets.",1489363200,,3579,4.813008130081301
