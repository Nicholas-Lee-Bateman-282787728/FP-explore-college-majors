2113041,1,B0002OXV1O,"I TRIED TO CANCELTHIS SET; A FEW HOURS AFTER I BOUGHT IT; BUT I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD TRY; BUT IT HAD GONE THROUGH ALREADY. I HAD A FEELING ABOUT THIS BEING ONE I MIGHT NOT LIKE AND I WAS RIGHT. I BOUGHT IT CAUSE I HAVE A COUPLE OF MOVIES WITH GINGER ROGERS FROM NOIR GROUPS AND SHE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND ONE OR TWO WERE VERY GOOD WITHOUT FRED ASTAIRE TOO. ""A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT"" MUST HAVE BEEN HER ROCK BOTTOM WORST MOVIE. LON CHANEY JR MUST'VE NEEDED MONEY BADLY TO PLAY IN ""SCREAM IN THE NIGHT."" THIS WAS THE WORST SHERLOCK HOLMES ACTING I EVER SAW: PLUS: MR MOTO; ALIAS PETER LORRE SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN BED FOR THIS ONE. THE LIGHTING WASN'T SO HOT AND IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY; PLEASE DO... IT WAS REALLY A 00...",1399075200,,715,4.006993006993007
2113042,5,B0002OXV1O,Anyone loving old movies will enjoy this DVD and it's so reasonably priced.  One can never go wrong watching a Peter Lorre movie.,1379635200,3,129,4.608695652173913
2113043,4,B0002OXV1O,"Of all the mystery volumes, this is one of the best. The quality of each of the stories are good and each can be considered on theirown right.",1379462400,4,142,4.107142857142857
2113044,5,B0002OXV1O,Classic movies bundled together at an affordable price. Well satisfied with the movie choices in Mystery Classics Series. Worth the cost.,1360281600,6,137,5.571428571428571
2113045,5,B0002OXV1O,"Since I was a little girl (back when?), my favorite books to read were mysteries!!  We only had a TV in our home for one year, so the library was my favorite place to go to, get my mystery books, head for home, and submerge myself into ""another world"" away from my actual world.  As an adult, I could open up my own library for I have a mega-ton of books...most of which are mysteries.  Now we have/had the wonderful world of VHS Tapes and DVDs...of which I have a lot.  So many of both that I have them cateloged so that I don't repeat buying something I already have.

Now, when it comes to these Mystery Classics that Amazon sells so inexpensively, I indulge at times.  I love the old mystery movies, and the selection of the Mystery Classics that Amazon sells are priceless (and believe me, when it comes to Amazon's prices in regards to these movies, they ARE priced at pratically no price at all).  These special DVDs have at least 4 and/or 5 movies on each disc, and the discs in this category that I have purchsed from Amazon have been amazing!!  These old movies are wonderful to watch...they take me into that ""other world"" of my youth where I can escape the everyday world of today.

So, if you are a lover of the old mystery classics, these are the DVDs to buy.  They are priced every so right (change-in-the-pocket right) and they are just GREAT to watch.  Would make a very nice gift, as well, without ""breaking the bank"" to purchase.

Keep up the good work, Amazon.  I truly will be back to buy more of these Mystery Classics...ones that I don't have, because I have a few.  Don't change the price, because besides being the mystery movies of the bygone days when they made GRAND movies and the movies that I love...I LOVE THE PRICE YOU CHARGE!!",1354320000,15,1760,4.3919753086419755
2113046,3,B0002OXV1O,"It's a good thing I watched the other Mystery Classics DVD sets before watching this one.  The four mystery films were hard to watch because of the bad quality of the original films.

I mean, why not clean them up?  The sound was very bass, the dark was very dark, the low contrast scenes were so bad that I could barely follow what was going on.  Further, the English accents and mumbling made watching these films a chore!

There were some positive points too that may help the viewer enjoy some early appearances of their favorite Silver Screen actors and actresses.

A Shriek in the Night with Ginger Rogers as a tough newspaper woman who is in competition with a former boyfriend reporter as they both try to solve a murder mystery.  Ginger's character goes undercover and is very interesting to watch as an actress rather than part of the Fred Astaire duo in her later years.  Historically interesting is the fact that she would give up her job to get married.  I guess that was what was expected or something?  The murderer's cackling is especially unnerving.

Scream in the Night was not that great although Lon Chaney Jr. (Wolfman) playing a dual role was interesting.  I think the producers had a split screen effect when Lon Chaney's character was talking to himself.

A silly fight scene with a jewel thief and Lon's character and the two women was more like a wrestling match than a fight and was downright silly.  Still, an interesting mystery.

The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes with Arthur Wontner as Holmes was really hard to watch due to the poor nature of the negative.  Based on an actual story by Arthur Conan Doyle (Valley of Fear) with an interesting story of a gang of murderers and their revenge against one Bertie and how this gang uses Moriarty for their own ends.  The heavy accents will have you rewinding with your remote as you mutter, ""What did he say?""

Mr. Moto's Last Warning is the best of the quartet as Peter Lorre's character attempts to solve the mystery of a gang of spies who plan to blow up a fleet of ships and try to start a war between France and England.  Can Moto stop them?  Lots of underwater action here, and plenty of stereotyping of the British (""What is the rot, what?"") and Japanese (Vewey solly, preeze) may be offensive to some.  But heck that was the 1930s.

Somewhat recommended, though renting a few on Netflix or Blockbuster might be a better bet.

2113047,3,B0002OXV1O,"I found that on each of these DVDs there is one movie that is not so good, but that is just my taste.  For the price, three out of four film noir are excellent.  An excellent buy for mystery buffs who like the black and white classics.  By the way, it's fun to see Peter Lorre as young and thin!",1304812800,6,295,3.8833333333333333

2113068,2,B0002OXV1O,"The film quality is inexcusably poor. We are fans of old classic film and have found thousands of very acceptable films (quality and premise) from the 1930s and 1940s. We are aware that many of these ""B"" rated movies will not be stunning intellectual achievements, but many can be fun and, entertaining. Apologizing in advance for the film quality doesn't mitigate the fault ridden film quality. At the extremely low price of these, the films are, however, worth a chance.",1424908800,3,472,4.9125
