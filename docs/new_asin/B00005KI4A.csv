7943495,5,B00005KI4A,"I can say that it's the tape that I look the most. All the time I look it, I learn each time new things. If you are interesting in swing dancing, in the music, the structure, the phrase, ... you must buy this video.
If I must save one videotape in my collection, I think it's this one.",997833600,2,285,3.9310344827586206
7943496,5,B00005KI4A,"This is my favorite video tape of the entire series.  Marcus and Baerbl produce quality instructional tapes, but I've found this one valuable for dancing to the music - even if it is Shag, Balboa, Lindy Hop, or any other form of Swing.
I've owned the tape for a year, and every time I view it something new sinks in.
This tape explains music structure and the concept of musicality so that even beginners can understand, but then takes the concepts and applies them to the actual dance.  Marcus and Baerbl demonstrate and instruct how to apply this knowledge with easy to learn moves.
It is a must have for any dancer that wants to learn how to really dance to the music instead of run through a script of choreographed moves.",997833600,10,726,4.492424242424242
