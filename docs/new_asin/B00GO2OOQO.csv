By Rob Jones

Lou Reed: Tribute is a 3 DVD box set released by Chrome Dreams. This is a riveting document on the moves and momentum of one of the greatest rock n roll players as well as an insight in to his peers, protgs and pals. It is conclusive that The Velvet Underground has had an immense influence on contemporary culture-and, from their early associations with Andy Warhol and his empire forwards this iconic New York pop product made an indelible mark on many musicians that followed. Reed and Welsh wizard John Cale were central to the Velvets early development and along with Stirling  Morrison and Moe Tucker a quartet was formed and modern music was kick started!
DVD 1: The Velvet Underground-Under Review collates analysis from those in the inner circle plus associates and journalists. The resulting assessment dissects the scene, the sounds and the evolving freedom of 60s expression that took Reed and his cohorts down a different route to the seemingly dominant peace and love population identified with west coast America. What becomes apparent is the colossus of creativity that sprung forth and even though the emphasis changed when Cale left and Doug Yule stepped in there was still a great deal to champion.
DVD 2: Punk Revolution-The Velvet Underground, The NY Dolls & the CBGBs Set
takes the Velvet Underground template and assesses what followed in terms of the acts that catapulted from a 70s Big Apple. From this point we are introduced to the likes of the New York Dolls, Television, Suicide, Blondie, Patti Smith and a cast of other integers. Some of the footage makes for essential viewing and it would have been a joy to have witnessed more of a Richard Hell led Television and their version of his classic Blank Generation tune. The venues and the variety make for a tantalising tale and we are the recipients of rock rebellion that still entertains us many years on.
DVD 3: The Sacred Triangle-Bowie, Iggy & Lou 1971-1973 tells the story of the crucial three and how their careers linked up. The nascent solo careers of this trio were enriched for the relationships that occurred and Bowie was hugely responsible for resurrecting the undoubted seminal skills of Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. The talented triumvirate turn out some incredible music although it is further down the road that Iggy reaps the full rewards of his bond with Bowie. Nonetheless, the glam and glitter of the era comes to the fore as well as further images of a halcyon period in the aural annuls.
This dynamic DVD package pays testament to some of the significant seminal substance from the vaults of the late, great Lou Reed and ices it with reflections of
a cast of characters who deserve the utmost respect for breaking barriers.",1440028800,2,2782,4.791666666666667

Even if your not a big fan of his music you will enjoy his way of working and the way every come to gather at the end with great results.",1426464000,3,297,3.95

8625260,5,B00GO2OOQO,"I was dubious about this set.  The fact that it is ""unauthorized"" didn't bother me, but the very low price (at least at the time I am writing this) did raise alarms.  I figured, however, that the price is so low, for three DVDs, that I could only be disappointed if the set turned out to be total garbage.
It isn't.  Far from it.  These films are professional and first-rate.  Unlike other budget, unauthorized documentaries, here you'll find several interviews with some of the people who were ACTUALLY THERE!  This is not just narration over footage we've all seen before, or unknown talking heads merely providing opinions.  We get to hear from several people who knew and worked with Reed and the other artists being discussed.  Also, thankfully, we do hear music from the actual artists being discussed, rather than generic, public-domain, ""sound-a-like"" background music, used because the filmmakers couldn't get or afford the licensed music of the real artists.
There is a focus more on Reed's Velvet Underground career, and a lot of time is also spent on the other artists of the Reed milieu, like Bowie, Iggy Pop, and Andy Warhol, which kind of makes the set's title ""Lou Reed Tribute"" a bit of a misnomer, but the topics of Reed's solo work and larger influence on music are certainly not ignored.  And while much of the information is well-trod stuff, many of the interviews have been done fairly recently, though surely before Lou Reed passed away.
Fans of Lou Reed and the Velvets probably won't learn anything new here, but because of the low price and quality of the presentations, this set is essential. For those unfamiliar with Reed, David Bowie, or Iggy Pop, or especially young music fans interested in exploring the history of rock and pop culture, this set is an excellent and inexpensive primer on the artists and an era.  In fact, because of the low price, it's a pretty terrific buy for all but the most casual music fans.",1414886400,5,1947,4.767857142857143
8625261,5,B00GO2OOQO,"All Lou Reed, as well as Velvet Underground fans should rejoice at the excellent deal offered here by the U.K. Chrome Dreams label. What we have here are 3 very good documentaries for about 5 bucks each that mainly focus on The Velvet Underground, as well as Lou Reed. The 1st dvd is titled The Velvet Underground-Under Review, and has a duration of 85, not just 75 minutes, as displayed on the outside box. The doc is actually the same one as Velvet Underground:Vanishing Point, which actually 1st came out in 2006. There is not much performance footage here but the interviews with Robert Christgau, Moe Tucker, Doug Yule, and Billy Name are, indeed quite revealing and insightful. It even includes an interactive quiz about The V.U. which tests one's inside knowledge of the band. Next up is The Velvet Underground, The New York Dolls & The CBGBs Set, Part One, 1966-1974. This dvd has a duration of 87 minutes and focuses mainly on The Velvets, as well as tracing the history of New York City's Punk movement, including the Andy Warhol influence, the reign of The New York Dolls, and the early start of the handful of bands who, despite their differences in sound, shared the same sensibilities and attitude 1st introduced to the cities musical landscape by The Velvets and Warhol a decade before. These were the groups who claimed the lower east side of the city and the former bluegrass club CBGBs, as their Ground Zero. The 3rd dvd is titled The Sacred Triangle, Bowie, Iggy & Lou, 1971-1973. This dvd has a duration of 107 minutes. The film focuses on how all 3 performers redefined their careers by meeting at the New York venue, Max's Kansas City, and essentially reinvigorated their careers, which resulted in turnaround of good fortune for all three performers. The film focuses on this era in which all 3 worked closely together. There are some very good interviews with David Bowie's ex-wife, Angie, Andy Warhol's Factory assistant Billy Name; Mainman Management vice president, Leee Black Childers; New York scenester Jayne (nee Wayne) County and many others from this era who provide an inside view of this very fascinating time. Overall, these 3 dvd's offer an excellent overview of this era at an extremely reasonable price. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!",1414540800,5,2273,4.875968992248062
