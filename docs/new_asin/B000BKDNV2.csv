2421235,4,B000BKDNV2,Anyone who likes classic cars will enjoy this romp through Leno`s car collection. You will see some very rare items and a few that are one of a kind. The steam cars are a real treat to see. Working ones are few and far between these days.,1307836800,2,238,4.085106382978723
2421236,5,B000BKDNV2,"My husband and I both like to go to car shows.  We really enjoy the old cars; they're so interesting, unique and fascinating.  Jay has a vast knowledge of all of his automobiles and presents them well. He goes into details about each one. It's really a great DVD and lots of fun to watch. He even takes some of the cars out of his garage and drives them around for a while.  It's quite a sight to see them on the highway. I think people will really be surprised when they watch it.",1184630400,7,481,4.095744680851064
2421237,5,B000BKDNV2,Simply the best collection of cars from a someone who truly gets what it means to be a car collector.,1176422400,,101,4.1
2421238,5,B000BKDNV2,"After reading a review of this DVD in the Orlando Sentinel, I knew it was perfect for my brother.  He's a car nut too, though he doesn't have the money to own 80 cars.  Leno also has classic motorcycles including a jet-powered one.  The video is 100 minutes and gives you a look inside his personal collection.
You'll see a 1909 Stanley Steamer, a 1930 Duesenberg and a 1955 Buick Roadmaster, plus lots more.
Recommended for car lovers.",1151712000,12,436,4.564102564102564
2421245,5,B000BKDNV2,"Takes you inside his ""garage"" to his many, many of his old, unusual cars, then he drives some of them, as they're all in working order.",1406851200,,135,4.230769230769231
2421246,5,B000BKDNV2,A lot of interesting information on what kind of cars Jay has. There is also a good amount of funny moments.,1388102400,,108,4.190476190476191
2421247,5,B000BKDNV2,"I bought this for my ""car guy"" and he really liked the amount of detail given about each vehicle. Jay's emotional attachment to his treasures and their memories was evident throughout!",1369785600,2,184,4.967741935483871
2421248,4,B000BKDNV2,"1918 Pope motorcycle was awesome. Don't miss it; it is in the Extras.

Of the 9 segments in the main program, 3 were on external, not internal combustion engine cars: Stanleys from 1906 and 1908 and a 1925 Doble.

Jay doesn`t just show you the car and let the funny guy with the big moustache drive it, no, Jay takes you under the hood, under the chassis, inside the boiler or condenser or generator. He knows his cars.

Getting the `06 Stanley Gold Cup Racer ready to roll is a scream, especially when the front end bursts into flame. The Doble was the highlight for me. Jay said that its design has not yet been improved upon.

Jay is not shy about pointing to blueprints to explain the operation, in this case, of a steam boiler that heats up in a few seconds, unlike the 20 min required by Stanley`s cars. The M-47 Patton tank engine car was cute, but I would have preferred an electric car in the set. Jay has a 1910 Baker Electric, with a nickle-iron battery. Wish we could have seen at least one electric, in part because the future of personal transportation is in electric cars (70% of our petroleum use is in transportation).

Jay is a great host and guide to these incredible cars, and if you have any interest in cars, or old motorcycles, you will love this program.",1369267200,,1278,4.398305084745763

2421253,3,B000BKDNV2,"Ok - someone has to be stinking rich, and it's cool that Jay collects these amazing cars, but it's kind of show and tell of the rich and famous.

My dad enjoyed the DVD, because it showed him some fantastic cars and vehicles from the past.",1357948800,2,239,4.195652173913044
2421254,5,B000BKDNV2,"I bought this video because I admire those who restore and collect great machinery of the past and because Jay Leno is funnier in an impromtu setting than he is on TV.

This DVD lasts 100 minutes and spotlights Jay Leno's collection of classic cars, motorcycles and machinery. Mr. Leno has a very large but eclectic collection - everything from turn of the century (that is, the turn of the 19th/20th centuries) steam engines to Duesenbergs to steam-powered cars to retro-rod Buicks.

Watching Jay and Dennis Gage trying to get a Stanley Steamer up to pressure is a real hoot. Jay quips ""It's the only car in the world where you can get scalded and burned at the same time!"" But, you also get to see how efficient it was once you got the steam up to pressure compared to early gasoline-powered cars.

I think this DVD shows the viewer the often tortuous path leading to what we call the ""car"" with the many important, as well as dead-end, technologies. The viewer gets a sense of early autos that were, quite literally, works of rolling art made by craftsmen and artists in every sense of the word.

Jay Leno and Dennis Gage play off each other quite well and it's an enjoyable video for the car enthusiast over all. I give this five-stars.",1331942400,3,1240,4.547085201793722
