8115497,5,B000EXG192,"I purchased this mini series as a gift for my dear friend, who has since passed on to Heaven.  We both enjoyed these period stories.  I had shared two other versions with her prior to buying this set.  This has more  an ""up to date""  story line with great additions to the story giving it more debth,  Very enjoyable.",1351900800,3,317,4.288135593220339
8115498,4,B000EXG192,"I have only read the first book in the Scarlet Pimpernel series, and that was years ago. Therefore, I can only evaluate how this production stands on its own. The first half, Series 1, is the best. The acting is superb and conveys real depth in the main characters.  Richard Grant plays the Pimpernel as at least as devoted to excitement and risk-taking as to high ideals, bringing coherence to his alternate personalities as pleasure-seeker and hero. Martin Shaw plays Chauvelin as a political opportunist becoming burned out by violence but still doing whatever is necessary, however corrupt, to survive. Ronan Vibert is a marvelous Robespierre, all the more threatening for being a dandy with a soft voice, delicate gestures (I love his brush-off indicating dismissal), and aristocratic manners. Elisabeth McGovern is an excellent Marguerite, loving, sensual, and looking more like a buxom 18th-century beauty than most of the other actresses. Anthony Green is good, though not brilliant, as the Pimpernel's level-headed ally Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.

The dialog is genuinely witty. Some of the repartee is borrowed from genuine 18th-century sources, such as the term ""staircase wit,"" here called ""carriage wit."" A more original example: Robespierre soliloquizes wearily to an underling: ""The people wanted liberty. And we gave them liberty. Then they wanted equality. So we gave them equality. And now what do they want?"" After a pause, the underling helpfully suggests, ""Fraternity?"" ""Don't be stupid,"" snaps Robespierre. ""They want money.""

The problems come in Series 2. Elisabeth McGovern, Martin Shaw, and Anthony Green appear to have left the show, leaving Percy without any Marguerite, Chauvelin, or Sir Andrew to play against. Percy displays an inconsistent attitude towards women. In the first episode he grieves desperately for the deceased Marguerite. In the next episode he merrily forms a relationship with another woman. In the third episode he swears off women, because none can measure up to Marguerite. There are plenty of Reign of Terror politicians who could replace Chauvelin, but none of these characters or the actors who play them here are as memorable. (One powerful historical character who I wish had been used is Danton.) The plots of the episodes start looking too much alike and some are weak. One theme is, a total idiot who has escaped to England goes back to France in an attempt to rescue someone else, an attempt they know and openly say will be a disaster. Once they get themselves and other people in deep trouble, of course the Pimpernel has to rescue everyone. All the derring-do can't quite mask the obvious illogic. True, the costumes are as good in Series 2, there's just as much action, and the dialog measures up well. I still wish Series 2 were as good as Series 1.",1342828800,,2809,5.088937093275488
8115499,3,B000EXG192,It was not what I expected and I didn't like the way it was presented.  Would have preferred a movie instead of a mini series.,1329436800,,126,4.04
8115500,5,B000EXG192,I absolutely loved this story!  It is a beautiful and accurate rendition of the original books.  This is a must see series for those who love period dramas.  Wonderful costumes and superb acting. Very romantic and adventurous.,1326844800,2,226,5.054054054054054
8115501,4,B000EXG192,"Richard E. Grant in fine form; this is a very entertaining 3 episode series. There is a second series, but, sadly, Amazon doesn't yet offer it. I hope it's coming soon!",1309305600,3,168,4.451612903225806
