There are plenty of episode and it's well worth the price.",1315440000,,165,4.15625
4314100,5,B004B93RHE,"Great babysitter for my 3 year old granddaughter, who doesn't watch tv.  Cute little cartoons!  Thanks Amazon for being so prompt!",1301011200,,130,5.142857142857143
4314101,5,B004B93RHE,"I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter to keep her occupied while I worked on remodeling our new house (she loves Max & Ruby but hadn't had a new DVD in a while).  I was hoping it would keep her busy for a few hours - boy was I wrong!  It kept her busy for DAYS!  If I'd let her, she would have watched it for 4 days straight.

I love the little giggles I hear from her as she's watching it, and as a parent I can appreciate the manners of Max & Ruby and the meanings of the stories.  Even when her tv was off, my daughter would be talking about episodes and parts that were her favorite.  Sometimes she would even make me watch a part (such as when Max is in the dressing room and pops out with his overalls missing) - and then she will sit there and crack up.

This is definitely one of my daughter's favorite Max & Ruby DVD's, and I'd highly recommend it to any family who enjoys watching these two delightful bunnies.",1299024000,2,921,3.972826086956522
4314102,5,B004B93RHE,"I'm so glad this DVD contains episodes that we've never seen.  Nick Jr. seems to run the same episodes over and over, so at least half of the ones on this DVD are new to us.  Plus, the episodes are entertaining with fun story lines and sweet interactions between the characters.  Both my children (ages 2 and 8) enjoy watching them.",1296172800,6,332,4.409836065573771
4314103,5,B004B93RHE,"Others have already mentioned the names of the titles in this DVD, so I'm not going to reiterate that.  Instead, I'm going to try to explain why Max & Ruby can attract and hold the interest of a 2 1/2 year old and a 5 1/2 year old so completely - not to mention their (cough) year old aunt.

First of all, Max & Ruby is not one of those frantic cartoons, the ADD-inducing type.  The opening sequence doesn't contain flashy edits - just various M&R scenes, the music isn't rock-based - it actually seems to be more out of the 1920's with its muted trumpet sound, and the tune is simple but catchy - very easy for the little ones to learn and recognize.  Each episode contains a main plot concerning Ruby - such as taking Max shopping for new overalls, setting up party for Grandma, etc. - with a subplot involving Max that seems unrelated to Ruby's plans but which usually disrupts it somehow.  Ruby is very vocal, Max usually speaks in sentences containing 1-3 words, and usually that one word is the key to the resolution of the problem Ruby winds up having with her plans.

A big attraction, I think, is that Ruby is an example of a very good big sister; heck, I would have liked to have had Ruby as my older sister - and I am the older sister in my family.  She obviously loves and cares for her little brother.  She might get exasperated and annoyed by him, but she is never nasty to him.  There's one episode (seen on TV - don't remember if it's in this particular DVD) where he keeps getting his new clothes and himself muddy and she has to keep giving him a bath.  I know that if I were in her position, by the third bath I would have been screaming at my younger sister out of sheer frustration, but Ruby's comment is usually, ""Oh, Max!"".  In his turn, although Max is portrayed as getting annoyed when he is excluded from the ""big"" bunny activities, he never resorts to tantrums, crying or nastiness.  My niece was a fan of M&R before her baby brother was born, and after he arrived I could actually see in her words and her actions how in some situations she was mimicking what Ruby would do in certain situations.  I think that she really does use Ruby as a role model of what a big sister should be like.  WWRD, indeed - LOL.

The cartoon is well-drawn and colored.  The style harkens more to golden years cartoons than to the style of Pinky Dinky Doo or Sponge Bob.  The colors are bright but not blaring; the atmosphere is never dark and brooding.  The conflicts are gentle, the kind of situations the majority of little kids could find themselves in when they are involved in some project.  The language is straight and to the point.  If Ruby tells Max ""no"" regarding something, she explains why; her behavior is never arbitrary or capricious.  For a little bunny with a limited vocabulary, the artists are totally able to portray Max's moods and responses through their drawing of his eyes - narrowed in rebellion, glinting with a bright idea, frowning in disagreement, etc.

The premise of the story is that seven year old Ruby and three year old Max live together in their own house in town populated completely by bunnies.  Their parents aren't present and aren't mentioned, though there is a family picture including the parents on the wall in the living room.  Personally, I wonder what happened to their parents, but the kidlets have never asked me that question (I've got a couple of answers worked out - none of which involve hunters or foxes - lol).  Their grandmother lives nearby and she is a frequent visitor, but Ruby basically mothers Max.  The Grandma character serves to loosen up Ruby's behavior; she tends to get more in the swing of Max's antics and lets Ruby see that it's okay not to be so ""grown-up"" at times.  There are other bunny parental couples (the Huffingtons, for example) and we know that their friend Roger lives with his father.  Both Max and Ruby have friends in their own age group that they interact with.  Ruby & Max seem to be known by the entire bunny community and are valued within it; they are never dismissed or ignored by the adult bunnies.  The situations Max & Ruby get involved with never place them in any kind of physical jeopardy; there are no dark or menacing characters in this series.  Instead, the two bunnies get involved in the types of situations and mix-ups that little kids often find themselves in, and by watching what M&R do, they learn how to work through conflicts and resolve them amicably.  That, I think, is the key.  Max and Ruby are an oasis of calm and affection, and little kids are drawn to that.",1295395200,13,4584,4.464585834333733

4314126,4,B004B93RHE,The children can relate to the simple stories.  Lots of fun.  My grand daughter is only two yrs old and loves these DVDs,1394409600,,120,4.173913043478261
4314127,5,B004B93RHE,"Our granddaughter just turned two and she loves Max & Ruby. We have several of the books and DVDs and she is enthralled with all of them. Max & Ruby are her favorite DVDs--she doesn't want to watch anything else. Highly recommend this and any other Max & Ruby items. The simple, low key and pleasant stories are perfect for little ones. Too much on tv/dvd for kids today is frenetically paced, high energy, loud and obnoxious. Not so with Max & Ruby. Our granddaughter is a very busy two year-old yet Max & Ruby always hold her interest without the loud, attention grabbing tactics of some shows. Sweet stories in the books match up to some of the DVDs. Max & Ruby always show tolerance and understanding even when little brother Max is getting under big sister Ruby's skin....and the stories always end up with little Max having something to offer his bigger and ""all-knowing"" sister Ruby. Our granddaughter even plays pretend Max & Ruby story lines on her own.....so fun to watch her incorporate their antics into her own play. Based on our granddaughter's love of all things Max & Ruby, I highly recommend this item.",1392336000,,1119,4.656565656565657

4314135,4,B004B93RHE,"I won't review the show itself, just this DVD.  If your kids are into Max & Ruby, then here are plenty of mini-episodes here to keep them happy for a few minutes at a time.  It's a bare-bones disc, with no extras to speak of.  But I doubt that toddlers are dying to listen to a director's commentary track, or watch a bunny-centric behind-the-scenes documentary.",1368835200,,362,4.538461538461538

4314159,5,B004B93RHE,"The vast majority of children's videos (that i have seen) are either cheaply produced, polluted with commercials, or riddled with concepts not suitable for children.

in stark contrast, the Max and Ruby series is an absolute  delight.

4314162,4,B004B93RHE,"My daughter is in love with Max and Ruby, and I have to admit that I like it too. Unlike much of children's programming, it's not overly preachy, forcefully educational or whining/loud/obnoxious. Instead, Max and Ruby are a refreshing loving pair of siblings dealing with their daily games and activities and interacting with one another and working through disagreements. Max has some amazing toys and Ruby has a great imagination. The Bunny Tales DVD is specifically fun, with fairy tales retold featuring Max and Ruby and some unexpected twists. Great DVD for airplane, car or everyday home watching.",1358812800,2,603,5.163265306122449
