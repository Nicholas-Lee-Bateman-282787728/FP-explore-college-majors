7883576,1,6305119430,"After a great deal of struggling to ""Get It"" I realized that this mediocre dance teacher had very little to offer.
Having learned dances from other instructor's tapes I naively expected them al to be of professional quality. Not so with Mr. Webb and his wife. What a disappointment. . .
Not only is Mr. Webb a poor teacher, but he and his wife appear more to be beginners than polished pros.  Examples:
1. Neither looks nor dresses like dancers.
2. Kyle's breathing is labored and is uncomfortable to listen to while he is intructing.
3. The music is inappropriate for the latin dances (more like country/western).
4. The Webbs are both stiff and seem quite ill at ease.
5. The sequences where they show a group of about 12 of what we assume to be their students doing a particular dance, are painful, although some of them seem more graceful than the Webbs -- and that doesn't say much since the whole crowd looks like they were scooped up from the local road house on a Saturday night. In fact, a few of the men seem to be on  a ""work release program"" just to be in the video.
I know these are harsh criticisms. But if I can save you the time and money by avoiding these 3rd rate tapes, my contribution to world of dance will not have been in vain.",1064016000,7,1250,4.337606837606837
7883577,2,6305119430,"A. Are these smooth dancers? Not really. Competent, but stiff.with limited steps covered in 3 tapes Kule does teach you clearly. some moves.  I got their $5. Wedding tape, & found several steps duplicated in this set. After 3 hrs, I did find 3 variations we could use.
B. Invest in the Astair, A.Murray or Pozo dance tapes instead!
C. Some of the group dancers were smoother than Susan, she needs to get some smooth dance coaching.  Also I found using the same music for Rhumba, ChaCha & Waltz not appropriate.

D. On tape three I found some clothes changes,and many session breaks were copied repeatedly rather than catch different camera dance demos, or better dance tempos.
E. Suggest Kyle enhance his dress & act as other Pro male instructors, rather than a casual local guy.
F. As the ""Amazon"" No-NO  Reviewer notes: Cheap tapes reflect the instruction quality + the lack of teaching skills.  Waltz was ok, but  everybody moved stiff and without passion for dance...
F.  For the VHS price, it's OK, but one would get much more by taking (2) 1-hr sessions at your local dance studio or SR.Center",1062028800,7,1099,4.692708333333333
7883578,5,6305119430,"To those people who are looking for excellent instruction and not hurried or rushed from one phase of the dance instruction to another, these are the videos for you.  The dance steps are gone over quite a few times, both for the men and women and executed slowly so you can understand the instruction in an excellent way. Tressa Mason has excellent videos that I also have, but her instruction is not for the average or slow learner.  They are fine if you are an experienced dancer, then I say use Tressa's videos.  BUT if you are starting out in ballroom dancing and / or brushing up on steps than Kyle and Susan Webb's are the videos to use.",984355200,50,643,4.38655462184874
