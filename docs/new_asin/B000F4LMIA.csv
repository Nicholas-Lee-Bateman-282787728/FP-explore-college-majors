2551313,3,B000F4LMIA,"None of this video is bad... indeed I got some good bits of advice off it straight away... only trouble is I keep falling asleep every time I watch it... I'm sure if one concentrates all the way through with camera in hand, trying things out while hitting the pause button it will go well... but don't expect the latest James Bond movie, even if the guy presenting it looks a bit 007 type...and even plays the piano *(fairly, not well).

It's in connection with his piano playing that the good tip I learned came from... how to handle your D200 so well, you can practice in the dark to manually get your fingers around the controls with top speed and efficiency.

Well that's my review of it. Don't let it put you off !",1168300800,,719,4.318518518518519
2551314,3,B000F4LMIA,"I bought this to have an introduction to the D200's features (it is my first digital SLR after a two decades of using a mechanical Olympus OM-1).  It is an odd mix of: a) Cheerleader (Hey, isn't this Nikon camera great!); b) Elementary School teacher (Now we'll learn how to take a picture. 'The Rule of Thirds' - painters have been using it for centuries!); c) Actual Instructor (Use the Dynamic Area AF with spot metering when shooting kids or pets. Here's why...). A DVD for a camera of this sophistication, and cost, it seems to me, warrants only category c).

But it does have some good instruction. And while it is true that the information provided in the DVD is in the manual, the manual alone is not always clear how the various pieces fit together. For instance, the DVD does a nice job of explaining how the metering system interacts with the focusing options and in what circumstances to use which settings (as mentioned above). The discussion of white balance is detailed and informative. In addition, it has a quick review of some of the lesser-used features, such as interval timed and multiple exposure photographs that I glazed right over in my first read of the manual.

In truth, I would have preferred the DVD be half the time and half the price, or better, the same length without the cheerleading or elementary lessons in shot composition. Overall, a neophyte is likely find some good tips while being a bit underwhelmed by the depth of the discussions.",1148947200,72,1475,4.687258687258687
2551315,3,B000F4LMIA,"I found this DVD to be somewhat informative, but the ""trainer"" was obviously reading from the script and was very wooden and awkward.  I thought this detracted from the presentation.  Most of the information is a basic review for anyone who's been a photographer for a while, or has ever owned a more advanced featured Nikon SLR.

This DVD is useful if you're new to photography and Nikon SLRs.  Give it a pass otherwise.",1147219200,36,421,4.648648648648648
2551316,5,B000F4LMIA,"Blue Crane did it again, another great instruction DVD. I loved the one they provided for the Nikon D70 and it saved me lots of mistakes and decreased my learning curve. I am now the owner of a D200 and in my opinion their new DVD is worth every penny and very well done.

If you are a professional or anyone who can decode all the features on the D200 then great... you do not need this kind of support.  Even though the Nikon D200 comes with a manual, the manual's explanations and definitions did not provide me with as expansive an explanation or an instant understanding of how to operate the camera as the DVD. I am very grateful to have access to this media.  As stated in the presentation ""a new car comes with a manual but the manual does not teach you how to drive the car.""

I spent two days absorbing the information presented and I am no longer struggling with all the new features on this camera and believe me there is a multitude of new learning. The D200 is not as forgiving as the D70 and it pays in quality photographs to know what you are doing. This is a professional camera and much more complex than the D70 in my opinion.

My ability to shoot perfect photographs the way I did with the D70 when I surpassed the learning curve is still far from constantly present when I use the D200; however, I am not totally lost due to Blue Crane's guidance and I am getting better each day. The instructor gives you exercises and solid information of how to operate the camera to obtain better photographs. A Small amount of the information on basic composition and types of lenses is repeated from the D70 video but, it was good to hear it again.

Often, I avoided many in-camera menu features on the D70 because of the various auto provided programs that comes with the camera (i.e. portrait, landscape, macro, etc.,) or I shot in manual mode most of the time; however, that kind of grace is not a component of the D200; therefore, it is necessary to learn how to use the camera's features to create those kinds of components and much more.

Also, to compliment your learning I recommend that you purchase John Cooksey's DVD ""Nikon D200 Training,"" he gives you indepth training and additional photo tips on all the D200 menus that you will not find on this DVD or in the manual. Both DVD's together, make the perfect marriage.

So, if you choose to avoid frustration and struggle in learning how to use the Nikon D200 right away, buy this DVD!",1145836800,58,2456,4.418141592920354

2551318,5,B000F4LMIA,"I ordered this guide so that I could understand all of the options and functions available on my new Nikon D200.  Since it is a video that I could watch, pause, then continue watching it was easy for me to understand. The explanations made a lot of sense.  There are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the D200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos. I highly reccommend it!",1145577600,29,430,4.3625

2551340,5,B000F4LMIA,This DVD is very helpful in helping you get acquanted with your camera faster. Some areas require replay to get a full understanding of the content but it is a good and useful DVD.,1182816000,,180,4.323529411764706
2551341,5,B000F4LMIA,"Hello Fellow Camera Enthusiast !

I'm from India and new to SLR Cameras. I was earlier on P&S.

After doing lot of research about SLR Cameras, I concluded to buy D200 out of D200 & D80 because of prime factors. I knew nothing about operating it.

  Then I ordered this DVD and let me tell u honestly that this DVD gives you a real insight into D200 along with offering some very special techniques.

  Each section is saggregated and clearly explained to give a basic information on the function and technique to use it professionally. Moreover, the advanced techniques shown/explained in the presentation are wonderful.

  I highly recommend this to anyone who's interested in getting hands on SLR's and specially D200. You won't regret buying this DVD.

Good Luck

2551342,5,B000F4LMIA,"Unless you're a professional photographer, you'll want this DVD.  I learned a lot about the features of my D200, but also about technique and good habits (invaluable to even non-D200 users!)

The D200 is a complicated computer with a load of features.  Even basic features, like focusing, are varied and complicated.  If you want to have a deeper understanding of your D200, start with this DVD and then buy the Magic Lantern Guide by Simon Stafford.  The DVD provides an excellent overview and the Guide fills in the blanks.

The DVD not only explains the key features, but suggests how to use the camera.  For instance, get into the habit of thinking beforehand - the lighting, the subjects, motion, type of lenses, etc. - then set up your D200 for the day's shooting.  Do this everytime.  You'll only need to make minor adjustments afterwards and the quality of your photos will be enhanced manyfold.

The section on how to take better photos - metering, focusing, depth of field, Rule of Thirds, etc. - were most informative.  I learned new techniques, even though I've been an amateur photographer for many years.

Sure, the manual is a catalog of features, but it doesn't clearly explain how and when to use the myriad of features.  This DVD will do that, and the Guide will explain more fully what you need to know.

Other than taking a one or two day course on how to use the D200, this DVD and Guide will provide the same information in a fraction of the time.  And you get to keep them for future reference and refresher courses!",1177200000,6,1539,4.627306273062731

2551344,4,B000F4LMIA,"Okay, so this isn't the most comprehensive treatment of the D200 and some of the info is basic photography.  But, photogs are by nature visual, and if you hate wading through the boring printed owners manual (like I did anyway), this DVD is a great way to get up and running with the camera.  Some people learn and retain video better than print. It is well done and interesting.  It is also the only intro to the D200 that addressed the need to establish a pre-shot routine to ensure all of the settings would work for the shot.  Maybe advanced amateurs do this in their sleep, but a beginner like me needed someone to show me how to do this.",1171756800,6,643,4.333333333333333
2551345,3,B000F4LMIA,"The DVD was reasonably well done, but only presents the basic information on the camera. The D200 guides, including the one that comes with the camera, have more information in greater detail.

One possible value of the DVD would be for someone considering purchasing the D200. It is a good presentation of the overall capabilities and functionality of the camera. (Would probably cause you to part with the extra money and buy the D200 in lieu of one of the basic models.)",1170892800,,473,4.7682926829268295

8117402,5,B000F4LMIA,"Some of the content is aimed at pretty low skill level users that probably wouldn't normally have this camera.  Given its significant price drop as of late though that may not be as out of line as it would have been.  Overall this video is one of the best produced and most informative camera use videos I've seen, and definitely the only one I've seen for the D200 that I would recommend to someone else.  My parents are considering a lower model like the D60 and I will probably suggest the Blue Crane DVD that covers their camera when they get one.  The video manages to cover a pretty wide spread of ability and can be rewatched down the road if you don't ""get it"" all at first to get more out of the camera.  It's not perfect but I doubt you'll find much better.",1236902400,,767,4.2620689655172415

8117404,5,B000F4LMIA,I really enjoyed this as it was a video and you grab your D200 and follow along and for me this was better than reading how to do things but that is my preference but the person on the video was very knowledgable and they covered the camera very well.,1207008000,,251,4.04
8117405,4,B000F4LMIA,"Warning, This is a beginners guide. I bought it, because  it would teach my partner, how to get the most from the D200.
It gave a decent explanation of the basic photographic workings, like depth of field. It did the job better than I ever could, because she could rewind and see it again. I don't have the patience to do it.
For the more advanced photographer it is almost useless.
Anyway, my partner found the camera too heavy and decided on the D40.
Overall...good for the uninitiated, but for the techies it is old hat.",1194825600,4,523,4.447916666666667
8117406,4,B000F4LMIA,"The DVD was fantastic. The instruction was very well organized and it focused on the most important features of the camera. They didn't just talk about the D200, they talked about photography basics as well. If you're a pro it might not be the best DVD for you because they do spend a lot of time teaching techniques to taking better pictures using the D200",1187568000,2,357,4.507692307692308
