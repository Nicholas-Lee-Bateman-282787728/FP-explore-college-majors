4380966,2,B004I11VZ0,"I have a large Hong Kong cinema library and lived in the south of China near Hong Kong for a while so I feel I'm in the position to compare a good movie with a poor or unacceptable one with regard to authenticity and realism. In my haste to buy this title (Ip Man 2) because I was extremely impressed with the first ""Ip man"" and a huge Donnie Yen fan I didn't look closely enough at the description.  This is a copy and a poor one at that.  Also in Mandarin only whereas the first ""Ip Man"" offered Cantonese which is the traditional language of Hong Kong and Foshan.  The language issue takes away significantly from the movie in my opinion.  Plus the image quality is not good with frequent ""jerky"" movements in the action.  Alas, you get what you pay for.....

Do yourself a favor and wait until later in the year when the real thing comes out.",1275004800,3,846,4.25625

4381065,5,B004I11VZ0,"If you have just discovered Donnie Yen, all I can say is LUCKY YOU! Yen's are some of the best martial arts films out there.. and I own the whole Bruce Lee collection. I like Yen's stuff equally, even a bit better. Although really it's not an either/or choice, both are great in different ways. Yen perfectly portrays a classic martial arts master - the calm meditative state which is perfectly passive, yet can explode into perfect activity with equal ease. In fact, some would say this state of awareness is itself martial arts, and without it kung fu is just a bunch of useless activity. So now go look up the rest of Donnie Yen's films.. some are cheesy, but there are probably half a dozen excellent ones with GREAT fighting scenes. Flash Point comes to mind - Yen mixes up some street fighting / MMA style in it which makes for some awesome footage.",1453334400,,855,4.487179487179487

The English villain is not a complex and subtle presence like General Mura was in the first. He is a one-note, puppy kicking, ""CHINA-MEN ARE STUPID"", buffoon who (quite frankly...) is a little offensive. However, putting that aside- the fight scenes are the best in the biz, Ip Man is amazing, and it's everything you've come to expect from the series.",1452038400,,465,4.5476190476190474

4381082,4,B004I11VZ0,I loved the movie except the unreal parts that seem to plauge martial arts movies.  Flying and floating are just not real.  It's one thing to be super agile but the fight with IP man on the table to prove his worth against the top Master really took away from the dice star rating this movie could have had. Other than that it is a good movie. Not bases on a true story as in IP man. But still a good movie aver all.,1444867200,,416,3.9404761904761907

4381103,4,B004I11VZ0,"Great film overall, but if you've seen the first than honestly you'll be completely satisfied with your Donnie Yen fix. He's never starred in a better theatrical release than the first Ip Man. I really only purchased this film as a collector of movie franchises, & this certainly will be one after the third chapter is released soon. I just felt after watching this that I saw everything it had to offer before hand which I did...the first Ip Man. My biggest disappointment was that the main villain at the end was completely wasted in his role as a performer. They casted the actor as a boxer when in fact he's a world class martial artist. Check out one of his first movie roles as a villain in the movie Bloodmoon. It's old so it might be tough to get a hold of it, but if you do believe me it'll be worth it.",1435795200,,812,4.279220779220779

4381144,4,B004I11VZ0,"Ip Man 2 follows one year after the first film. Donnie Yen once again is great in the role. The fighting scenes are  just as good, if not a bit better then the original. Overall though, I feel the story is a bit of a step back from the first Ip Man film. Like another reviewer said, it really feels very similar to Rocky IV in terms of the last act of the film. Fans of the first film & martial films will no doubt enjoy this one as well. I for one am looking forward to Donnie Yen returning to role of Ip Man in a 3rd film in the near future. Sammo Hung was also very good in the role he played, it was great seeing him & Donnie Yen together on film again after Kill Zone (AKA S.P.L.).",1423958400,,686,3.8652482269503547

4381173,5,B004I11VZ0,"The continuing story of the IP Man.  If you liked the original then you're definately going to want to see this the next chapter.  In the first movie the IP Man was a well to do person who had a pretty nice life and family. He basically practiced martial arts as a sport or hobby....For the enjoyment of it.  In this movie he and his family had to flee their comfortable life and live day to day scraping by with whatever he could get. This movie show him really working through many tough situations

Personally I really liked both back to back movies because it really is one big story.  Oh and of course there's plenty of interesting fighting to go around.  What is amazing is in the Extras they talk about a few of the major actors either had no formal martial arts training or non in this style, but learned fast and really appear as masters on film",1413676800,,854,4.30625

4381181,5,B004I11VZ0,"Ok, I really like Donnie Yen, (Loved him in the Seven Swords) so I am biased, but Ip Man is a really good movie. The first one was great and really got you involved as far as wanting to know about the man and his style of fighting, part two was equally good in my opinion- a little off in some scenes but still good.
Ip man is struggling to open a martial arts school to teach his style of fighting and must prove himself to the other martial arts teachers and in the end fights for the honor of his country and respect. I am soooooooo disappointed that Donnie Yen is not in the other Ip Man movies because I feel that he did such a great job in these two, but I will probably still check them out as well.

It picks up where the first movie left off and continues with the telling of Ip Man's move to Hong Kong up to his introduction to Bruce Lee.  I thought the fight scenes were well-choreographed and the challenges of post-war China apparent.  I found it worth the watching.

If you watch it to find out more about Ip Man, you should read up on him first. I didn't know anything about him. After I watched the movie i read up on him and found out the story wasn't accurate.
  I remembered that my daughter said this was her favorite martial arts movie so I decided to watch it. I thoroughly enjoyed the story to it, the acting was pretty good, the fight scenes were well done. It's all subtitled in English. I found the history behind the movie about how the Japanese invaded China interesting. It doesn't go all into the details but gives you enough to grasp the struggle they had.

I loved the martial art moves and enjoyed the way the plot developed--in a way that keeps you fully entertained.

This is the story of the master fighting the battles (Kung Fu and otherwise) in an attempt to establish a martial arts studio and following in Hong Kong following his escape from mainland China.  The subtitles are so well done that you kind of forget about them after a while and the translations don't feel corny at all.

4381248,3,B004I11VZ0,"I was so thrilled with IP Man that I immediately rushed out to get IP Man 2. Viewers should understand that this is simply not as good a movie as the first one. That's not to say that there aren't parts to be enjoyed... the scene with masters fighting on top of an unstable table was fantastic. However, the idea of Eastern martial artist versus Western boxer has been done too many times, and in this case, the evil boxer was just WAY over the top. The Chinese people would have drug his arrogant body through the streets, and I can't imagine anyone complaining. If you've seen Rocky IV (remember the Soviet giant played by Dolph Lundgren), you have this movie to a tee.

Donnie Yen was excellent of course, but the English voiceover was kind of cheesy. Overall, not a bad movie, but not quite up to its predecessor either.",1385769600,,824,4.456953642384106

I got the first Ip Man to see more about how Bruce Lee's fighting style came into being. I was taken by the story of the man himself, and found a whole new path here...first, anything about Ip Man, who had his own very real trials and tribulations...and then Donnie Yen as the artist who portrayed him. I have a new favorite in martial arts movies in Donnie Yen. I will watch nearly anything that has his name on it. I see here, that Sammo is the one whose name is on the box...but he is NOT Ip Man. Sammo has lots of movie credits under his belt, but he is just not my ""hero"", although his skills speak for themselves. Donnie Yen's portrayal of Ip Man is what caught my fancy and fed my idea of the character of the man himself. ""Smashing"" movie.",1383091200,,907,4.129943502824859

4381276,4,B004I11VZ0,"As the sequel to Ip Man this was a pretty good movie. The fighting sequences were not overdone for the most part although that is why I gave it only 4 stars. There were just to many techniques that came right out of the early Kung Fu flicks of the 60's & 70's that probably should have been toned down some. Fortunately no one was jumping straight up in the air 15-20 feet to a tree branch or rooftop. On the other hand, hitting someone in the chest with a palm strike isn't going to drive them 5-6 feet off the ground and throw them 15-20 feet away.
Another thing rather interesting is that, like most contemporary Kung Fu films, Ip Man 2 is premised on an underlying theme of Chinese suppression and degradation by foreigners. In the first Ip Man it was the Japanese, in this sequel, the British. This theme was also the premise of most of Bruce Lee's films; the Chinese fighting back against claims of the, ""weak men of China"".

That said, this was a fun movie to watch if you like the martial arts. It also makes it enjoyable when you realize many of these actors have studied martial arts and put so much time into the choreography. This is especially true with the close-quartered hand/arm techniques being presented as Wing Chun. In that regard, the actors did a super job of displaying their own individual abilities. Sammo Hung has always amazed me with his agility considering he isn't exactly a ""Bruce Lee"" specimen of physical fitness....even when he was younger.

To conclude, I recommend this movie if you want some good, clean, martial arts fun and put aside the fact that this movie isn't a documentary as to the real life of Yip Man.",1374192000,,1650,4.496666666666667

I've never heard of this series before. So, my first exposure was this one (part 2), which I streamed last night. I liked it enough to order the 4th DVD in the series.

Other reviews state that the main character was also in Jet Li's Heroes. Again, that film was pure art and artistry. In this film, you feel like you are back in the period, and you easily attach to its characters. And, the martial arts choreography was moving.

If you enjoy good martial arts films with real plots, you won't be disappointed.

Thanks for creating this film and the series.
I look forward to the next chapter.

Donnie Yen is amazing at Kung Fu but his portrayal of Yip is breath taking. He incorporates his own touches to the role while conveying such a level of humbleness.

The humble disposition of the actor was striking when one also think about the martial arts superiority.

I also like the ""'reason"" for his fighting. The normal story line for these types of movie is some young boy stumbles upon a martial arts master; is trained; revenges his family or some love one death. In this movie the reason for the IP Man using his skills is for (it appears) a non self-centred caused - for his family, community and by extension country.

I showed the movie to a group of teenage boys showing social change a man may have to go through in life and some of the expectations of him.",1357430400,,717,4.5

Though I found it entertaining and don't regret purchasing it I personally enjoyed the first one more than this sequel. In my humble opinion the story line was more compelling and the drama more real and intense in the first. But the sequel is still very entertaining with plenty of excellent fight scenes.

The setting is British-occupied Hong Kong where we find Ip Man trying to open a martial arts school. He must prove himself as a capable master before the corrupt, locally established Masters will permit him to become an instructor. The climax of the movie is Ip Man's match with the brutal Twister, the British heavy-weight boxing champion. East meets West in this final climactic clash.",1357344000,,764,4.701492537313433

  Donnie and Sammo played their roles well. The choreography was excellent and the martial arts believable. Yes that includes the final table challenge scene. While I can't begin to calculate the probability of one person landing a table, let alone two; I can say I have experienced some magical (ie. Quantum physics assited explanation required) kung fu happenings. And I don't have the training of a master. So who knows what Yip Man experienced. In the end the overall kung fu is very enjoyable. Lotsa ropes, wires and computer animation not necessary.
  Now this story holds a common theme when white people are involved in Chinese Kung Fu films. The so-called 'sick men of asia'. It was the propaganda that the colonialists sold to scare the Chinese people into submission and get recruits also. And the ditaste for colonial white ways was, while over the top, way palpable. Its clear in this film that the national psychae is still healing from the dehumanizing treatment of 100 years.
  However, don't let the racism stop you from enjoying a great flick. I don't. As a tall black man with beard and joylocks, upon seeing me most asians go into defense mode and start clutching purses, squaring shoulders and protecting women until the danger of me has passed. This has been going on for decades. I still enjoy martial arts and asian culture. Thankfully not every one buys into the propaganda.
  Finally if your like me and can't afford or find a good teacher and so you train yourself, this movie provides good techniques. Enjoy. JAH Love",1356307200,,1662,4.827464788732394

It makes a lot more sense if you've watched the first - it helps so so much in understanding reprising characters roles and relationships together.

I'm not sure if this is the case for all DVD's, but I ordered this one from Indigo and the English subtitles made a mistake in the end fight when Ip Man tells Sammo Hung to punch Twister in his Biceps. Instead of saying biceps, it says 'ribcage' which was disappointing when I had my friends over to watch it and they never seen it before. I had to stop the movie and tell them about the mistake, then continue watching. Other than that - the movie is fantastic - flows really nicely (it has the same run-time as Ip Man 1 but feels shorter when you watch them back-to-back). It's funny, enjoyable and has a lot of whoop-ass from our very much loved Donnie Yen - definitely one to add to the collection",1353456000,,941,4.3107344632768365

4381399,5,B004I11VZ0,"Ip Man 2 is the sequel to the Ip Man movie once again directed by Wilson Yip. This is now the 5th collaboration with Donnie Yen. Their credits include SPL aka Killzone,Flashpoint (rumored to be a prequel of Killzone),Dragon Tiger Gate,Ip Man. The movie has most of the returning actors from the first Ip Man. Sammo Hung,Lo Meng (Five Venoms,Kid With Golden Arm),Fung Hak On(Magnificent Butcher,Last Hurrah for Chivalry,Five Shaolin Masters),Darren Shalavi,(Mortal Kombat Web Series,Tai Chi Boxer)Kent Cheng(Once Upon a Time in China),Dennis To Yue(Ip Man Legend Begins),Huang Xiao Ming (Sammo Hung's son).

  After years of Ip Man's escape from Mainland China. He relocates to Hong Kong to live in poverty. Ip is trying to make ends meet and wants to teach Wing Chun to students. After he has some recognition he must get permission from the other masters to teach and prove himself that he can. One of the masters is played by Sammo Hung who is an expert at Hung Fist. At the same time Hong Kong is ruled by the British and make the Chinese work for little money. There is an event boxing match of Britain's famous Boxer Twister (Shahlavi) who is an arrogant selfish bully. He ridicules the Chinese martial artists at the boxing event and ends up hurting a couple. Master Hung decides to counter and go into a match with Twister. Twister has killed Master Hung in the ring and now Ip Man must prove that Chinese martial arts can defeat Western boxing.

 The fighting is superb. Combines both Wire Fu and Kung Fu and the editing never looked better. Donnie gets to fight with Shaw Brother's legends Lo Meng and Fung Hak On,even though the fights were short and they are both in their 60s,they are still in top form. Sammo's fight with Donnie is different from the one in Killzone because they fight in a round table and have very limited space. Later on they become friends instead of wanting to kill each other. Huang Xiao Ming plays Donnie's disciple Wong Shun Leng. His fighting isn't bad but to be Sammo's son he's got to prove himself. Dennis To from the Ip Man prequel plays Sammo Hung's main disciple. It is one of his first films and he later proves in the prequel that he can throw down some serious Wing Chun and can also be a major kung fu star like Wu Jing. This movie put Darren Shalahvi's career on the map. Appearing in the Webisode of Mortal Kombat playing Kano and fighting along with Michael Jai White. Darren had more roles in B movies with Steve Austin and Steven Seagal. At least he is out there being recognized instead of being in crappy cameos in Zack Snyder movies like 300 and Watchmen. If you blink you probably missed his cameo appearance. This is one of the best Kung Fu movies in years along with True Legend,Ip Man prequel,Reign of Assassins.

4381406,2,B004I11VZ0,"Im not going to pretend that I am a martial arts expert nor am I even a big fan of martial art films. But I think it is fair to say that the western boxing Vs eastern boxing story was absolutely absurd.

Ive watched enough boxing while channel surfing to know that a boxer would not have the speed or agility to block flurries of Wing Chun strikes like the way we see in this movie. A boxer has the capacity to put his guard up and at most absorb a range of swings and jabs. He would Duck and weave and possibly use good footwork. But in the ring this boxing champion develops some sort of pseudo kungfu-boxing style that is completely implausible. He doesn't even look like he is boxing.

I don't know who to blame, the choreographer (who I have alot of respect for... absolutely loved 'Project A') or the screenwriter for coming up with this ridiculous premise in the first place.

I mean, how on earth do these masters go about fighting on a turn-table like manga characters and then only to enocounter a final battle scene where they struggle to dodge and weave a big swinging baffoon boxer. It would have been more plausible to see a Van Damme type kickboxing character with superior strength rather than a boxer.

Having said that, just then I wondered what would have happen if someone like Mike Tyson got in the ring... which makes me wonder maybe this could have been successful if the choreographer actually respected the sport of boxing. It could have been quite interesting to see two totally different and unaware styles of fighters come head to head.

And really what else is left to really admire about IP man 2. The plotline is similar to the original film. Locals get into fist fights and duels until a foreign entity comes along and threatens the Chinese way of being. It doesnt help when the foreign entity is just pure one dimensional evil.

But then it departs from the original in the worst way. Whilst it was refreshing to see IP man destroy the Japanese General in the first film without raising a sweat, the sequel descends into rocky\Bloodsports\Kickboxer\every-other-fighting-movie madness. A done to death fighting sequence we have seen since fighting movies were conceived. The protagonist makes a friend who gets killed in the ring, he then challenges the bad guy to a subsequent fight. He get his crap beaten out of him but gets back up to win in the end. Yay! Cue the lame speech. Cue the curtains. Good night London!",1332460800,2,2449,4.592677345537758
4381407,1,B004I11VZ0,"Spoilers below - you have been warned.

I really liked the first Ip Man film and it's a tribute to that movie that I gave this one a chance.  Subtitles are not my thing.  The film begins with Ip Man in Hong Kong trying to establish a martial arts school. He runs into some bad guys and kicks a sizeable amount of @ss.  Everything is looking good - I'm totally on board.  He then has to prove himself to the city's other Kung Fu masters and we get to see the best fight in the movie, where Ip faces off against Master Huang and does some incredible acrobatics as they do battle on top of a giant, wobbly table.  Trust me, it's a great scene.  Neither man actually wins the fight, but it is apparent to me that Master Huang will be the villain of this movie and that's a good thing, because Master Huang is quite awesome even though he's about 60 years old and is running the city's docks using the power of his mighty martial arts militia.

But then Ip and Huang learn a life lesson, and respect is shared, and they have some sort of bonding moment going on.  Which is when ""Twister"" the English boxer shows up and this film goes straight into the toilet.  Twister appears to be a Middleweight boxer and the most imposing thing about him is that he's sporting a six-pack.  During a public martial arts demonstration Twister challenges an 8-man team and proceeds to WIN.  Color me shocked.  But who knows ... maybe they were all white belts, or something?  After the ruckus dies down, Master Huang defends the honor of Chinese martial arts and steps into the ring.  Let me give some background.  10 minutes ago we just saw Huang throw a rickety chair on top of another rickety chair, then leap 15ft into the air on top of them both, and then somersault onto a wobbly table where he fought Ip Man to a draw.  The same Ip Man that killed 10 Japanese fighters in the first film without breaking too much of a sweat.  To put it bluntly, I'm expecting this fight to last about 3 seconds, the conclusion of which will probably be with Twister's decapitated head rolling down the aisle after Huang puts a foot to the side of his skull, Billy-Jack style.  Well, not so much. Huang gets beaten to death.  Literally.

I won't go into any more of the movie.  Twister is awful, and I've seen people walking down the street that could kick his butt.  Your hero can only be as good as your villain and challenging Twister has all the emotional impact of, ""do we need to buy more toilet paper?""  I was so disappointed by the last half of this film that I can't give it more than one star.",1332115200,7,2571,4.308333333333334
4381408,2,B004I11VZ0,"I would probably give this a 2-star rating if I wasn't so surprised by its 4-star average here at Amazon.  First, let me say that I enjoyed the original Ip Man, which also suffered from one-dimensional cardboard villains but not to this extent. This movie takes the cardboard villain to an even stupider level of unbelievability, complete with maniacal laughter and wild-eyed gesturing. And this on top of the unbelievability of a western boxer with no prior exposure to kung fu being able to so effectively counter a fighting style he's never seen before. Finally, all of the major plot points are straight out of Rocky IV, which was a cheesy movie to begin with. I could have lived with any one of these three major weaknesses, but put them all together and you've got a really poor film.

The end result is a shame because, like the original Rocky, the original Ip Man was an entertaining movie. Like Rocky IV, though, Ip Man 2 is mostly an uninventive cash-in on the original's success.

=====

Based on YJM's comment regarding western boxing (see below), I am raising my review to 2-stars. However, my main gripe was not with the matter of eastern vs. western fighting, but rather with the atrocious writing and acting. There is a world of difference between Ip Man 1 and Ip Man 2: The main antagonist in Ip Man 1 had some subtlety and nuance even though his sidekick was a one-dimensional cartoon bad guy. That's why I gave Ip Man 1 a 4-star rating. In Ip Man 2, unfortunately, ALL of the bad guys are cartoon villains straight out of looney tunes. It's a shame, really, because Donnie Yen is wonderful and did as well as he could given the hideous script and casting.",1331683200,,1674,4.588628762541806

4381410,1,B004I11VZ0,"It is a given in any Chinese martial arts movie that there are hierarchies of fighters. There's always going to be a kick-ass hero and an awesome bad guy ( this is why Tsui Hark's ""Seven Swords"" failed, despite some spectacular cinematography -- the villain wasn't awesome enough ). The hero and bad guy are supposed to defeat everyone easily except for those that are at his ( or her level ). The bad guy is supposed to be a ""great fighter"" with an ""invincible style"" (the more esoteric the better ) and the joy is watching the two duke it out at the end. I spent most of my childhood weekends in Singapore looking forward to  Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest wuxia movies; that's what I was weaned on, that's what I love. In these movies, there is a fundamental principle:  great fighters do NOT get beaten by ""inferior"" opponents. If they are beaten, then the opponent has a ""great"" or ""tricky"" style of fighting. In fact the time it takes for the ""hero"" to beat up someone is a measure of the opponent's ""worth.""
So here's why I find this movie, which is supposed to be a tribute to Ip Man and Wing Chun, to actually be extremely insulting to not only Ip Man and Wing Chun but offensive to all Chinese. Let me explain:
The first half of the movie is pretty good -- there are some great fight scenes: Ip Man butt kicks about a couple of dozen HK thugs impressively, and takes on a host of kung-fu masters,  not only defeating them easily, but more importantly, giving them ""face"" afterwards ( the Sammo and Donnie table fight is fabulous ). This sets up Ip Man as a decent, and honorable man, and that Wing Chun is a ""worthy"" martial art.  The scene with Sammo as a family man is also a nice touch.  If the movie had ended there, I would have given it 4 stars, and been quite happy.
The second half of the movie just pretty much destroys the entire premise of the first half.  In it, a caricature of a racist, white boxer, easily beats up Sammo ( who is supposed to be Ip Man's equal ), and takes Ip Man to the limit, before our ""hero"" finishes him off. Now I'm not saying that kung-fu is superior to Western boxing or any other martial arts in ""real-life"" -- that is a debate that can go on forever -- but in the world of Wuxia movies, Chinese kung-fu is supposed to be the pinnacle of martial arts! That's why I watch the hero practice endless hours of doing ""horse stances"" or sweeping floors for years, before being ""blessed by the master"" to actually become a disciple and learn the ""inner door"" secrets. If I watch a movie about Wing Chun, I fully expect Wing Chun to be the ""superior"" style.
The first half of the movie is spent establishing Sammo and Donnie's credentials, by showing off all their impressive kick-ass moves, convincing the general viewer that they aren't to be messed around with. In the second half of the movie, you are introduced to this lame, no-name Western boxer ( firstly, he has no pedigree and he's not someone famous-- like Joe Louis, or Sugar Ray Robinson, and secondly, boxing is hardly a mysterious, esoteric art )-- who would probably be in deep trouble if he wandered in some wrong inner city neighborhood -- go toe to toe with Sammo and Donnie. If I were not a martial arts fan,  from the principle of equivalence,  my conclusion would be: (1) Chinese martial arts is worthless because any decent boxer can take out a pretty good kung-fu master -- No need to search for a ""real master"" when any boxing gym will do, and (2) the Chinese really are pretty wimpy because one average white boxer is better than 2 dozen HK thugs. The jingoistic message of the movie (Chinese kicking Western butt), which is supposed to appeal to Mainlanders, actually backfires on itself.  Both the director, Wilson Yip, and the writer Edmond Wong, should have their heads examined, because in the rush to cash in on Mainland Chinese sentiment, they've destroyed the basic and fundamental principle inherent in all Chinese martial arts movies, and in the process, actually given credence to the ""Weak Man of Asia"" myth.",1331337600,11,4040,4.485714285714286

Perhaps Im taking this too serious, but the way IP Man was built up in the original, virtually untouchable, to be almost beaten by a boxer, ludicrous. That big baboon would not even be able to lay a blow on him when fighting fairly.

4381446,4,B004I11VZ0,"Donnie Yen again plays the legendary martial artist Ip Man in this followup to the original IP MAN. I haven't seen the original, so I have nothing to compare it to, which may or may not be a good thing in terms of a review, since my impressions are not preconceived.

It is 1950. World War II is over. The Communists have seized mainland China. Ip Man and his family have fled to Hong Kong, where they are living a very hand-to-mouth existence as he tries to establish a school to teach Wing Chun.

Hong Kong is rundown and economically depressed in these first years following the War, and few potential students can afford Ip's fees. In this dog-eat-dog environment, students are at first hostile and aggressive. Ip Man is forced to fight and best Wong Leung, a street tough who eventually becomes his famed successor. Leung brings many other students to Ip Man for training, and his school begins to flourish in a small way.

This minor success draws the attention of Master Hung (Sammo Hong, the fight choreographer for the film) who demands that Ip Man be tested against other Masters before his school is recognized. After winning their respect, Ip Man is dismayed to discover that the entire exercise was a prelude to an extortion scheme. Refusing to pay, Ip Man soon finds his school closed down, but he continues to teach nonetheless. His moral stand shames Master Hung, who begins to befriend him.

The film's centerpiece is a bloody, violent and murderous contest in the ring between a seemingly unbeatable Western boxer (Twister) and the Chinese Masters, at first Hung and then Ip. It was deeply disturbing to view the blatant racism of the British and the smoldering resentment of the Chinese.  How much of this is factual and how much fictional is hard to measure.

Unsurprisingly, Ip Man wins, delivering a very ROCKY IV-like closing speech. His resultant fame and honor bring success and more students to his door, including a very young Bruce Lee.

The fight scenes are executed wonderfully, particularly a lengthy, complex battle inside Master Hung's fish market. Donnie Yen is excellent as the stoic, tough, but kindhearted Ip Man.

If IP MAN 2 has a star-losing drawback, it is the fact that the film focuses much less on the moral and philosophical underpinnings of Ip Man's teachings and more on mindless street brawling. But Donnie Yen projects the kind of equanimity necessary for a Ch'an Master, giving us the strong message that martial arts are less martial and more of an art than the flying kicks and blindingly fast punches seen in this film would have us believe.

4381453,4,B004I11VZ0,"Donnie Yen comes back as Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster Ip Man in this thrilling sequel to the 2008 hit ""Ip Man."" Set in 50s Hong Kong, where injured Ip Man is taken after what happened at the end of the original, the story of the loose biopic takes a similar course to that of its predecessor, though martial arts stunts remain as effective as before.

Ip Man and his family move to Hong Kong under British colonial rule, where he opens a martial arts school to propagate his discipline. Things are not easy for the master, however, as a street scuffle involving his first student Wong Shun Leung (Huang Xiaoming) leads to a brawl in the market, and then a fighting ceremony attended by local teachers including a Hung Ga master Hung Chun-nam (Sammo Hung), where, he is informed, the reluctant hero must prove his skills.

But Ip Man's courage and strength is really tested when a British boxing champion ""The Twister"" (Darren Shahlavi) insults Chinese martial arts and his country too in public.

With Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung, ""Ip Man 2"" does not fail to deliver top quality action scenes aplenty, though some of them clearly rely on wire stunts (which I do not hate). Donnie Yen is in perfect form as the titular hero with fast blows and defenses. His intense close combat style is impressive.

With more focus on our hero as a loving husband, ""Ip Man 2"" explores his personality with several episodes not directly related to fighting. Simon Yam reprises the role he played in the original, as Zhou Qing Quan, Yip Man's best friend. Lynn Hung also returns as Ip Man's understanding wife, now pregnant. Even Fan Siu-wong, who played the original's aggressive martial artist-turned robber Jin Shanzhao, shows up.

All in all, Wilson Yip, director of the two Ip Man films, manages to keep a brisk pace, though some viewers (especially those who haven't seen the first ""Ip Man"") might think that the film could have been better without some supporting characters. What I find irritating is some of the British actors and their terrible overacting, which I hope is intentional. But, with an amusing reference to Bruce Lee (one of Ip Man's students), ""Ip Man 2"" is an enjoyable martial arts action film.",1315094400,,2206,4.749347258485639

However Ip man 2 just...is more holly wood and less story. Yes, the fights in the Ip man 2 are really cool and well choreographed, however, the story is just sub par at best. It talks Ip man, who wants to teach students his style of Kung Fu. However he is unable to get the respect of the other masters, therefore cannot open one. He does his thing and at the end of the film, has to fight a 'super' villain. The story just not very complex. This is a film for a friday night where you just want to see guys beat stuff up. Its great for relaxation but its sub par story sets it off. However, if you want to really see a full fight movie, watch Rocky, Ip man ONE or Fearless(Huo Yuan Jia). Sadly, Ip man 2 just does not live up to that standard.  I really would like to love this film, but it really..is just not in the same level as any of the other movies stated.  Its a classic sequel that disappoints the audience since it does not live up to its original standards.

When I heard there was a part 2 I had to see it.
And...
Excellent acting for the most part.
Pacing, score, direction were all done well.

The movie had me just like the original but then for some reason they wanted to go into ""boxing vs Kung Fu"".
This direction really baffled me as it didn't seem to fit with the themes presented in IP Man or the first half of the sequel.

The whole boxing vs martial arts seems a tad ridiculious to begin with.
I think it has less to do with the method and much more to do with the fighter themselves as to who would win in such a match.
Both forms of fighting are beautiful and require great discipline.
That's really my only complaint about IP Man 2, the Brits were portrayed as very one dimensional and none of them could act very well either.

That point asided IP Man 2 is still an excellent Kung Fu movie that deserves to be seen just for the awesome fight sequences in the first half of the movie.

4381465,3,B004I11VZ0,"I really enjoyed the first Ip Man movie, but there seems to be something missing from this installment.  There aren't as many interesting supporting characters as the first movie and many of the returning characters from the first movie are relegated to the background roles of little importance.  For example, Ip's family, especially his wife, played a huge role in the first movie as it stressed the tension between the combative life Ip Man led and the stable and happy family life his wife desired.  In the second movie, the family is there, but it is more of a side note and hardly a main component to the plot.  Character development certainly isn't a focus in the movie as it was in the first.

The plot, that is another major barrier I found with getting into this movie.  Not only does it seem to use the same plot points as the first movie, only done in a less polished fashion, but it seems that the writer(s) of the movie had watched one too many Rocky movies, especially Rocky IV. (*minor spoiler alert*) This movie imitates so many things from Rocky IV, it becomes borderline absurd.  I mean, it has everything from a reenactment of the Apollo Creed match-fiasco to the ""If I can change, you can change"" speech after the penultimate fight, with the subsequent conversion of the hostile crowd to his philosophy -- though, I must admit the training montage before the final fight was a lot more subtle as you didn't have to watch Ip Man running up any large mountains.

Also, just like Rocky IV, Ip Man has a strong nationalistic message at the root of its plot, just like the first movie. It attempts to show the viewer that Chinese culture is superior to the ""foreign devil""  Brits, who are just like the Russians in Rocky IV.  Just as the Japanese were portrayed as vicious inhuman two dimensional villains, the Brits are portrayed as uncultured two dimensional barbarians that act like comic book villains, maniacal laughter included. It's fine if the writers want to write about the British occupation in Hong Kong, but the writing makes the British into caricatures that are unbelievable outside of a movie script and  there seems to be a pro-Chinese culture agenda similar to the pro-American agenda of Rocky IV, which I guess is fine if you are from the country being portrayed as the superior, and not so much for the country being portrayed as the inferior. It doesn't help that the British actors in the movie are atrocious at best.

Also, I'm sure there were Western Boxing vs. Eastern Boxing matches that took place in the past, but I doubt they were as drawn out and absurd as they are in this movie.  I mean, seriously, you put a guy with boxing gloves on, who follows traditional Western Boxing rules, against a guy who kicks, knees, grapples, throws, and is allowed his full range of martial arts ability, which includes punching a guy in the face while he is being held on the ground, and we are to expected to believe that would be a good fight? Maybe in a Street Fighter game that is believable, but in a ""loosely-based"" biopic, it is laughable.  I guess it is as believable as Rocky winning a boxing match by just blocking with his face.

Anyway, people watch Martial Arts movies for the fighting and this movie has a lot of good scenes, in particular the one between Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen, but there aren't as many good scenes as the first movie.  In fact, there just aren't as many fighting scenes as the first movie and that is a shame, since they are a beauty to behold.

I think the plot drags the movie down too far and is not as well told or put together as the first movie.  I do suggest watching this movie at least for the fighting scenes and just laugh off the plot as I do when I watch Rocky IV.",1309651200,21,3744,4.513313609467455

The action scenes are nothing short of spectacular.  Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung demonstrate how they got where they are today.  The choreography was extremely well done.  The story is fantastic (though it is, at least partially, based on the real life of Ip Man).  The acting was quite good for a Kung Fu movie (I would personally say it was just good period).  The subtitles were probably the only weak point here - they suffered the same fate as all subtitled movies: strange/random misspellings.  Thankfully, there were fairly few of those.

4381481,1,B004I11VZ0,"I was really looking forward to Ip Man 2, as I enjoyed the first movie a lot (see Zen Throw Down review: [...]). Unfortunately Ip Man 2 is a disappointment and a surprisingly weak film. It's a classic case of a martial arts movie getting too slick for its own good while trying to go mainstream. Ip Man 2 lacks the fights needed to appeal to fans of the genre, but it's not strong enough in plot and characterization for mainstream audiences to care.

Ip Man 2 is certainly a well-crafted flick, but I just didn't find any heart or soul in it. The fights contain far too much Matrix-esque wire-fu and some of it is so silly that it makes the film ridiculous. You can't treat it as anything other than a popcorn flick, and yet it's trying to (I think) have some kind of heart. Worse than that, there are tons of fast cuts that prevent the performers from showing off their skills, and this makes you wonder if it's all special effects. Big turn off for a genre fan.

So what about the things mainstream audiences will look for: plot, acting, characterization? Ip Man 2 doesn't deliver any of this. Donnie Yen reprises the role of Ip Man capably enough, but his sincere performance seems lost and out of place in this silly movie. It's almost as though he and his character are beside the point. His student, Lueng, was well-played and interesting, but the character is not developed and goes nowhere. His wife's pregnancy was all front and center but has nothing to do with anything. A close friend of Ip Man is homeless after taking a Japanese bullet in the head and...not sure why that's in the movie as it also goes nowhere. Sammo Hung has great presence, but his character is undefined. First, he's a Hong Kong martial arts mafioso (which is a bit silly all by itself), but then we find he's working for the Brits, but then he changes sides...sort of. Huh??? What's the point of this? The final scene with a young Bruce Lee is dorky and feels tacked on to the end of the film.

The main reason Ip Man 2 will fall flat - for any viewer - is that there is no conflict. Who or what is Ip Man fighting? First we see him trying to open a martial arts school to make ends meet. Then he comes into conflict with Hung, but since Hung's having his chain yanked by the Brits they become allies in short order. Then the rest of the movie is about a boxing match with a British boxer, which Ip Man has to take on and win because...uh, well...I'm not sure why he has to take it on or win. So there can be a big fight at the end of the movie?

I also have to say that this Western fight/match with crooked 'bosses' rigging things was done far, far better in Fearless. In that movie, if Jet Li's character didn't take the match or lost it then his school and people would be shamed. Ip Man 2 tries to mine this vein but lacks the heart and soul to make the sparks fly. Ong-Bak worked this angle better, too, and it wasn't even trying to nor were those fights the core of the film (except as awesome displays of skill!). In Ip Man 2, the crooked Brit police chief running the match is too poorly played and laughable to be a real villain. His arrest at the end is corny. The match itself is not very interesting, and I still don't get the 'realization' that inspired Ip Man to open the decisive can of whoop-ass at the end. Lame.

Without much martial arts action and without a central conflict or a reason to care, it's hard to find Ip Man 2 anything but empty and directionless. This undermines the impact of the fight scenes, especially since they aren't being showcased for their own sake. I walked away from the movie feeling as though its only point was to cash in on what I understand is an Ip Man phenomenon in the East. Donnie Yen lost a good deal of credibility with me on this one.

Worth renting if you're a huge Donnie Yen fan or can't live without seeing more of his Ip Man franchise. Even in that case, though, don't expect much.",1306627200,11,3931,4.291105121293801

4381484,1,B004I11VZ0,"For those who watched the spectacular Ip Man, the first movie, this is going to be a great disappointment.  From the beginning to the end of the movie it cannot compete with the first one.  This movie was miserably directed and I feel for Donnie Yen who had to read the script and act accordingly.

The Character of Ip Man is made too weak as well as Sammo Hung who plays his adversary for most of the movie but then suddenly he gives Ip Man tickets to a boxing match one day and just like that they become fast friends--yeah right.  Unbelievable and it shows just how much respect the director has for the intelligence of the audience...absolutely none.

Ip Man first opens a martial arts studio on a roof of a business building and a whose-school-is-best fight breaks out between Ip Man's students and Sammo Hungs shortly thereafter.  Ip Man gets evicted from the place where he was teaching because of it and ends up teaching inside his own apartment.

In the first movie Ip Man fights the second best and beats him.  Then, a rogue tough guy martial artist comes into town and fights every single martial arts master in Ip Man's town and beats them all.  Finally, he learns of Ip Man and challenges him.  Ip Man readily hands him his backside in a hand basket.  I don't think he ever touches Ip Man in that awesome indoor fight.

Now, we go back to Ip Man 2.  The same rogue is in the movie and it's as if they castrated him, gave him a new hair style and took away all the toughness he had in the first one and becomes Ip Man's friend.  Becoming Ip Man's friend was great but giving him the new girly look was not.  Near the end of the movie Ip Man does something which is very unprofessional--he begins bragging about how he beat up the rogue who had helped him so much in this movie and had become his friend.  You don't talk bad about your friends--you just don't.

In Ip Man 2 there's a fight in the market where he and his best student fight off an army of Sammo Hung's students and friends--I'm talking about a massive amount of people.  That's where the rogue comes to the rescue, when things are just beginning to look hopeless.

Now, at this boxing match the true villain of the film is an English boxer--a real tough customer.  He insults the Chinese fighting style so Sammo Hung gets in there and gets killed by this boxer--who the hell is going to believe that after the fight he had with Ip Man which was deemed a stalemate.  No boxer, regardless of his skill, should have even been able to touch Sammo Hung if he's as good as Ip Man.  It defies reason.

Yep, you guessed it, Ip Man gets angry and picks up the gauntlet.  The fight between the boxer and Ip Man is the biggest most ludicrous fight I have ever seen based on what happened in the first film where Ip Man beat the intestinal fortitude out of 10 Japanese black belts simultaneously (without being touched).  Later he beat the Ultimate Japanese fighter in one of the best fight sequences on film.

He does all this in the first film, fights an army at the market in the Ip Man 2 and yet he can barely beat a single boxer with muscles.  Shameful!

I can't emphasize just how bogus, unrealistic and stupid this movie was.  Poor Grand Master Ip Man is probably turning in his grave.

Perhaps if it would have been directed by Sylvester Stallone, it may have been better--but I doubt it.  When any caliber of boxer meets a true Grand Master of Wing Chun--the boxer doesn't have a chance--period.

At best the movie was an abysmal disappointment.  Do yourself, your family, and friends a favor and just watch the first film of Ip Man and bypass Ip Man 2; you'll be glad you did.",1306195200,7,3651,4.361481481481482

This is martial arts action at it's finest.

Fortunately the wire-work is very minimal - and the rest of the movie is very, very enjoyable.

But getting back to the topic - Ip Man 2 is not as good as the first one, but part 2 is good.

This is a great martial arts film, and movies along at a very nice pace, with lots of tension as you cheer on Ip Man.

Though I really liked the film, I gave it four stars rather than five because I liked the first film much better.  That's because the story in the first film was a bit more original, meaning this story was predicable (reminded me of Rocky), but still worth watching.

Viewers should know that this film isn't exactly a biopic, but loosely based on the life of Yip Man, who taught Wing Chung to Bruce Lee.

If you've seen the first Ip Man, you definitely need to see this film.

4381505,5,B004I11VZ0,"I have to begin by confessing that I lost interest in martial arts movies some years ago, some time after Bruce Lee's death and the cancellation of the TV series ""Kung Fu."" As our culture dictates, an excess of martial arts films and Bruce Lee copycats followed, saturating the market with mediocrity. However, after watching the exciting and spectacular ""IP Man 2 - Legend of the Grandmaster,"" I am kind of attracted to these films again. This is one feel-good, kick-ass movie!

""IP Man 2"" apparently takes off where the ""IP Man"" - which I haven't watched - ended, and it is also inspired in a true story. In it, IP Man (the wonderful Donnie Yen) returns to British-ruled Hong Kong in 1950. He arrives dirt poor, with a pregnant wife and a young son. With the help of relatives, he opens a martial arts school at the roof of a building, and business slowly begins to pick up. Sadly, just when things are a getting good for him and his family, and when he is becoming famous as a great teacher - he teaches the unique style of Chinese Wing Chun --, he runs out of luck: he meets Master Hung (Sammo Hung), who pretty much owns the city, and is friends with the police. Nobody could open a martial arts school without his approval, which could only be done by following this condition: ""You are to be open to anyone's challenge. If you aren't beaten when the incense burns out, then you are qualified to teach."" In addition, once you earn the right to teach, you have to pay Hung's gang a monthly fee. Even though IP Man unexpectedly wins and earns the right to run a school, he doesn't accept to make the monthly payment, which causes friction between him and Master Hung, making life unbearable for IP Man. Furthermore, an English boxer arrives in town, telling the Chinese Masters that western boxing is superior to Chinese martial arts, generating political and racial tension between the Chinese and the English. As you may expect, the future is in Master Hung's and IP Man's hands.

I was just mesmerized by ""IP Man 2 - Legend of the Grandmaster."" The final act of the film reminded me of the Joe Louis and Max Schmeling fights, the Rocky movie series, and other films. The mind-blowing fight scenes, coordinated by veteran Sammo Hung, the fabulous cinematography by Poon Hang-Sang, and the delightful production design by Kenneth Mak, are perfectly glued together by director Yip Wai-Shun. Donnie Yen is a true charismatic actor that you want to see more of, perhaps a true inheritor of Bruce Lee. By the way, the IP Man series is based on Master Yip Man's life. He was credited for creating the Wing Chun School, as well as having a very famous pupil in real life. You will meet him at the end of the film. The fascinating Blu-ray edition of this film includes making of documentaries, deleted scenes, shooting diary, interviews, and more. (Hong Kong, 2010, color, 108 min plus additional materials).

4381506,5,B004I11VZ0,I give this movie 5 stars. I have seen both IP 1 and IP 2.  I enjoyed them both and will eventually purchase them for my film collection.,1303689600,2,137,3.892857142857143
4381507,4,B004I11VZ0,"For longer than a moment, I thought that Ip Man's brash and impulsive young pupil, Wong Leung, was the Bruce Lee character. But, doing the math, Leung was actually some years older than Bruce would've been at this stage. And, it turns out, Wong Leung is also a real person. But there's a marked resemblance between Bruce Lee and the actor who plays Leung. Anyway, fear not, Bruce Lee does eventually make an appearance, but it's not until the film's just about over and it constitutes such a brief moment that I was disappointed.

IP MAN 2: LEGEND OF THE GRANDMASTER brings back Donnie Yen as the staggeringly accomplished Grandmaster of Wing Chun, and the story picks up from the first film. In 1950, having fled the Japanese-occupied town of Foshan, Ip Man and his wife and young son make a new home at British-occupied (some say British-oppressed) Hong Kong, wherein Ip Man attempts to found a martial arts school showcasing his Foshan Wing Chun style. It's hard going at first, with Ip Man struggling to provide for his family and initially no students in sight. Ip Man isn't clued in to local hierarchy, this pecking order instituted by the different kung fu schools in Hong Kong. Ip Man has yet to pay his dues. It seems that news of his Japanese-stomping exploits back in Hoshan haven't yet made the rounds. Ip Man wishes the Twitter account had been invented back in 1950.

Custom dictates that, to establish credibility, Ip Man must accept challenges from rival kung fu masters, which leads us to one of the film's highlight sequences: Ip Man, precariously balanced on a wobbly table taking on one challenger after another, eventually facing off against the highly skilled master of the Hung Kuen style, played by Sammo Hung. A major plot point concerns the tension between Ip Man and Sammo Hung's Master Hung. Master Hung leads Hong Kong's consortium of sifus; he dictates policies, sets monthly dues. Master Hung is also the resentful lackey to a corrupt British policeman, an accomplice to the bullying foreign white devil's racketeering and exploitation of the Chinese populace. There comes a point in which Master Hung must choose between honor and financial gain. How he responds will inspire Ip Man to take on his most formidable foe yet, the boorish boxing champion Mr. Twister, in a bout between eastern and western boxing.

If it's cool with everyone, why don't we just make it official and dub Donnie Yen as the new king of Hong Kong cinema? Yen is so perfect in this role and very charismatic, and I marvel at his blend of skill and acting. Yen's thoughtful interpretation underscores the fact that this Ip Man is older and even more contemplative (and he certainly takes more of a beating). Slender and unassuming, on the surface calm and accommodating, but masking depths of resolve. Ip Man is slow to anger, and prefers exhausting all peaceable options before reluctantly lifting up his fists. But underneath the conciliatory smile is a layer of swagger, yo. It only surfaces when Ip Man is forced to accept a challenge fight or when he's extremely fed up.

It's crazy how wing chun is so very aesthetically pleasing to look at, and it's a pleasure to watch Donnie Yen execute the wing chun style with such control and expertise. It doesn't hurt that Sammo Hung also puts on his action director pants. Four core combat sequences ignite the film. Ip Man and his pupil Leung fend off a horde of goons at the fish market, and Ip Man unveils his hurtful application of a pallet (somewhere here, we also see Siu-Wong Fan return as a reformed Master Jin). The most visually stunning fight is probably Ip Man on the wobbly round table taking on all comers, with choreography making excellent use of wire work. We look on as Master Hung steps into the ring with Mr. Twister to defend the honor of Chinese boxing, and Sammo Hung shows he's still pretty damn spry. Finally, there's the big showdown between Twister and Ip Man, with Ip Man having a harder time of it than initially assumed. Sorry, but as much as I love western-style boxing, I don't buy that a great pugilist can beat a great martial artist. All things even, it seems to me the martial artist just has many more options, and it's more likely that we see the outcome from BEST OF THE BEST 2. But it's interesting, isn't it? Bruce Lee or Manny Pacquiao?

IP MAN 2 isn't quite as emotionally gripping. Ip Man's time with his family is still served, I feel, in perfunctory manner, although Ziong Dai Lin (who plays Ip Man's lovely pregnant wife) gets more screen time this time. Familiar themes crop up, and, if you really think about it, one of the major arcs here is just a rehash of the plot from the original film, with the Brits subbing for the Japanese. The show of nationalistic pride is about as subtle as a vicious Ip Man pallet to the face. Stuntman Darren Shahlavi (who plays ""Twister"") doesn't advance his acting career with his over-the-top performance. Shahlavi's presence - and everything that goes with featuring a white oppressor in a martial arts film - severely undermines the quality of the movie because, each time, it's presented in such heavy-handed fashion. Very cheesy. Still, the spirit and philosophy of Ip Man - as channeled thru Donnie Yen - command the screen, and IP MAN 2: LEGEND OF THE GRANDMASTER ultimately counts as a passable sequel to what I consider to be an all-time classic. 3.5 stars out of 5 for this one.

Two discs for this set. The first disc has the feature presentation, the Making Of the film featurette (00:17:36 minutes long), and three IP MAN 2 trailers. Disc 2 has these extras: the Behind the Sets segment explores four of the sets used in the film: Ip Man's neighborhood, including his residence and the roof which doubles as his wing chun academy (00:02:54), the fish market (00:02:18), the Chinese restaurant (00:02:26), and the big & small arena (00:02:17); Deleted Scenes, including one with Twister beating up on another opponent in the ring (totaling 00:09:06); Shooting Diary (00:03:05); and in-depth interviews with the cast & crew.

This was an excellent sequel to the first! I got a glimpse of the table fight scene on You tube and was like ""lame""! Far from the truth and was actually one of the best parts of the film, not to say the other fight scenes were lame (far from it). I highly recommend this film especially on Blu!

Watching IP the night before (again!  :-)), I never felt lost in the character roles or ever lost in the direction they were going. I was suprised with the dubbing with IP2 at first but got to like it more and more as the movie went along. I thought the quality of the audio was richer and deeper than IP as well. My speakers got some workout in the lower ranges more so than IP so this was nice. Due to this, I was immersed and better captured with how things were progressing. The variety of fights and the personal side of IP was definitely a plus for me and I consider this a very very good sequel. Would I dare to say it was better than the first?

4381512,4,B004I11VZ0,"I can't speak for everyone, but this was how I've come to enjoy this series of movies:
1) I saw a jaw-dropping clip of the first movie and was swept by the elegant yet brutal fight choreography.
2) After researching reviews on Amazon by those who've seen it already, I struggled to find it and was ultimately disappointed that it hadn't hit our shores yet.
3) Patiently waited, thanks to the distractions of life.
4) Saw it in Walmart one day and was so excited that I used my feet to purchase it.
5) Watched it and was thankful to all Gods that it was not some complete throwback to the time when Kung Fu movies had some weak plot carried by poor actors that served as filler in between fight scenes.  I cared about the characters for the actors carried them well, it had roots in actual history and the portrayal of it wasn't goofy, and after it had ended and the credits rolled, there was yet another reason why I respected it, that Ip Man was an actual historical figure, key in training a martial arts icon: Bruce Lee...kick ass!  Finally, the cherry of all revelation, the second one was on it's way (of course to our American shores for I was sure that the film had probably been enjoyed and is old news in its country).
6) Patiently waited yet again though I supplemented my anxiousness having seen many trailers on YOUTUBE, though they weren't as much of a spectacle as the first clip that won my interest, but seeing the first film in its entirety had won my faith, so I kept myself excited.
7) I caught a fan-edited trailer which included at the end the arrival of a young Bruce Lee into Ip Man's school...kick ass! I found a reason to reinstate my full excitement on par with the anticipation I had with the first film.
8) Saw it in Walmart one day (the wait being a lot shorter than with the first film) and was so excited to buy that I purchased it with a dowry of cattle and blocks of goat cheese.
9) Watched it and something happened: I found myself just watching it, not with the fervor of a clapping seal eyeballing a fish mid-toss, my viewing of it had a remarkable lack of the ""oooooooooooo"" of an down-turned axe kick hammering someone's upturned jaw, nor did it have the ""daaaaaaaaaaaamn"" of Ip's use of random objects to repel multiple opponents. After watching to the point to where Ip's wife hands him their newly born child I paused it and wrote this immediately...AS A WARNING...DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM HOPING TO FIND THE SAME SPECTACLE THAT ATTRACTED YOU TO THE FIRST, BUT RATHER BY THIS FILM FOR THE LOVE OF THE WISE AND RIGHTEOUS MOUNTAIN OF INTEGRITY OF IP MAN'S CHARACTER!!!!  It does have very good fight scenes but those scenes don't seem to be the emphasis, instead they are second to the man...that is the IP MAN (yes I realize that was a cheap kernel of corn).  After the viewing and the credits rolled, I am very happy that I bought this as a continuation of the character's story, and when I think of it, wishing that there should have been better fight scenes seems rather...selfish of me.  It was great to see Samo Hung again, and seeing old characters return to resume their roles but have become totally different people (we don't see the development which is an acceptable shame, the pace and story would have drug). I did enjoy this film thought not in the same way as the first, it's more about the struggle of life after war, it's emotional and at times as uplifting as the first, especially after Ip Man rising above but still being the modest and gentle soul that he is(except when he's bashing your nuts in with a wooden pallet but if that happened it's more likely because you were being an ass).
10) I like this film and would understand if others won't find it as entertaining as the first and detest it, maybe even say it is boring, to that I say that Samurai Power Rangers now comes on in the afternoon on Nickelodeon...go...and be at peace...",1303344000,,3897,4.437150837988827

The difference is Ip Man 2 is actually entertaining, the fight scenes are still beautifully choreographed; but while the original Ip Man made you identify with the protagonist, made you feel sorrow through his revenge that led to the final scene, Ip Man 2 seems trot along only because the audience already knows that Ip Man is a hero, and it tries too hard to outdo itself to drive home that point.

4381520,4,B004I11VZ0,"Ip Man is still the only martial arts film I've ever given a perfect score. Similar films usually throw in those silly bits of humor that come off as lame rather than actually being humorous. It probably hits its target overseas audience well, but the difference in culture probably has something to do with how American audiences don't appreciate those bits as much. Either that or the storyline is usually fairly simple or borderline atrocious while the fighting scenes are spectacular. If you're a fan of martial arts films, you see these types of films for the action scenes. A good storyline and exceptional acting are usually just a bonus. Ip Man broke those boundaries. It had an intriguing storyline and a fantastic cast to compliment its jaw dropping action sequences. The only flaws the film seemed to have was that it eventually had to end and left the audience wanting more especially the way the film ended. The desire for a sequel was extremely high and, for the most part, the sequel doesn't disappoint.

I had originally thought that Ip Man 2 wasn't able to capture the same amount of heart that the original film had, but I no longer believe that to be true. Ip Man 2 still has all the heart and emotion that the first film did. Everything from Ip Man realizing his friend Quan (Simon Yam) is brain damaged because of him to Ip Man trying to restore honor to the east by taking on a western boxer, the emotion is still there. It just isn't as strong or as powerful as it was in the first film. The same atmosphere is established quite easily, but the struggle to show the world that Wing Chun is a respectable martial art seems to take a backseat to other plot points that aren't necessarily less important but seem to take away from what made the first film so special.

The sequel is still very solid and extremely entertaining. Any scene in the film featuring Sammo Hung is gold. His adamancy for the Chinese culture is half of his character's charm. The other half is split between him trying to provide for such a large family and the amazing action sequences he's a part of. The sole reason to see this film is for the Ip Man/Master Hung match that takes place on a table top. If you've seen S.P.L. Killzone, you know how fantastic a battle between these two can be. However, the Yen/Hung match in Ip Man 2 tops the one in Killzone though. Their encounter will be the thing fans will remember and be talking about the most after walking out of the theater and for good reason.

Just a few sidenotes and nitpicks, the sound effects seemed to be off at times. The main occurrence being when Ip Man goes to meet Master Hung at his dojo after their pupils get into it for the second time. After Hung tells his pupils to leave, the sounds of their footsteps just didn't feel genuine and seemed like the sound was too loud or excessive or something. The film also features the fastest baby delivery ever in recent film memory. The woman goes into labor one scene and two scenes later, she's holding a baby. No mess and no 27 hours of labor? Why have an old fashioned pregnancy when you can just DVR it and fast forward through it later? Lastly, the film leaves you wanting even more than its predecessor did. Mostly due to the Bruce Lee tease featured at the end of the film.

Ip Man 2 doesn't sweep you off your feet and smack you in the face quite as hard as its predecessor, but it's still very worthy of carrying the ""Ip Man"" name and is a joy to watch. If you enjoyed the hard-hitting action of the original film, then you'll have no problem being entertained by this sequel.",1297728000,44,3597,4.453717754172989
4381521,4,B004I11VZ0,"I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of this new film starring Donnie Yen (You may remember him from ""Hero"") entirely in Cantonese with English subtitles which will be out in theaters in the U.S. and Canada on January 28th. Donnie Yen is reprising his role here as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip man in this martial arts film. I never saw the original but apparently in it, he escaped the Japanese occupation of his hometown and with his pregnant wife and family have moved to Hong Kong which is living under British colonial rule.

Ip Man begins his life in Hong Kong barely making ends meet renting an apartment and trying to start a martial arts school to teach his Wing Chun style. He is challenged by several neighborhood ruffians who eventually grudgingly give him respect and ask to serve under him as students. Being a kind-hearted man and pleased with the opportunity to teach, he does not push them very hard for their student fees knowing they are also struggling financially under British rule. His school is put up against other martial arts schools in the area competitively and they all clash and fight with territorialism. Eventually all the schools must unite together in order to face the British for their honor.

The British are demanding payments from the schools in return for allowing them to stay open (like offering ""protection"" in gangster movies). The British do not respect the Chinese and often ridicule them in public. A Western-style boxer named Taylor ""Twister"" Milos comes to town to fight and entertain the British and by mocking and insulting the Chinese martial arts demonstration opening act, Ip must step up to defend the honor of his people and his own kung fu, Wing Chun.

I know that was a lot of summary, but it seemed needed to really get across the themes in this movie. This film is a delightful throwback to the good ol' days of kung fu. Though I love the wire martial arts styles in films like ""Hero"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Fearless"", and ""Iron Monkey"", classic kung fu battles of men hitting and kicking each other in defense of their homes, family, country, honor, etc. still are a pleasure to watch. I loved Donnie Yen in ""Hero"" (basically loved EVERYTHING about that movie) and it was so enjoyable to see him in this role and to find out it was based on a real person's story who eventually went on to train a young Bruce Lee. Wow! This probably won't be a very wide release in the U.S., but if you happen to see it is in your area and you love martial arts movies, go have a fun afternoon in the theater! Yes, you will have to read subtitles, but that's ok. I felt like I could have watched the entire movie muted without subtitles and still understood easily what was going on since everything is so physical not only in the fighting scenes but in acting and reacting in conversation.",1296345600,76,2854,4.592156862745098

The Wing Chun is the only good part of this movie, the rest of the movie is complete fiction.

Did anyone notice that his wife and kid look the same even though Ip Man 1 was in 1937, and Ip Man 2 was 1950?

I am sorry, but this is not the first time Sammo Hung has been part of a Chinese propaganda history film, and I just wish they would
stop tarnishing the real Ip Man with this fantasy life that never happened.",1283472000,2,487,3.9591836734693877

4381526,5,B004I11VZ0,"IP MAN was my favorite movie of 2009, so I was excited to watch IP MAN 2. I was not disappointed. Can't say any more. Get this DVD and watch it! The DVD itself was great. Note that this DVD comes in a slim glossy slipcase, not a regular DVD amray case. That's fine with me. Takes up less space. I'm more interested in the DVD itself than the packing. Nothing is more frustrating to me than buying a DVD, and getting quality I could have gotten downloading. Don't worry about that here. Picture quality is great. This is a dual-layer DVD, so there's less compression = better picture quality. Subtitles were perfect. I speak Cantonese, so some things they have to translate slightly different than the Chinese meaning, but the translation was as accurate as it could have possibly been. My wife who doesn't speak Chinese loved it as well. There are also a few special features on the DVD that we enjoyed.",1282521600,5,903,4.512195121951219
4381527,5,B004I11VZ0,"I'm not sure what the last reviewer is talking about. The English subtitles on this DVD are perfect. I'm wondering if his seller sold him a different DVD? The movie is great. If you haven't seen IP MAN yet, get it. Then get this DVD and watch it right after. I'd have to say that the first IP MAN was a bit better, but I'd give the first one 5 stars, and this one 4 1/2 stars. The DVD is great quality. It is a DVD-9 with a high bit rate transfer and an excellent picture. The subtitles as I have said are excellent quality. This DVD is uncut. I saw it the first time in Hong Kong. I previously bought this movie on DVD, and it had about 5 minutes cut from it, so I'm happy this DVD is uncut. Highly recommended.",1282521600,5,712,3.986013986013986

Donnie Yen is incredible.",1282521600,,328,4.222222222222222
4381529,3,B004I11VZ0,"Missing note on product description that the video is in DVD-9 format.  Not all DVD players can play those type (DVD-9).  That usually indicates that two discs were copied onto one disc (DVD9)- Asian movie format, or bootleg.  That latter may not be likely though but cannot be ruled out.  Asian Video was very responsive to my concerns and quickly provided a full refund not long after I returned/shipped back the movie to them.",1279929600,6,429,4.756756756756757
4381530,4,B004I11VZ0,"This film continues the story of Ip Man 1. He was considered one of the best of the Wing Chun martial artists and Bruce Lee's oringinal teacher. I am a Tai Chi teacher so stories like this interest me. Although it was great to see Sammo Hung (who is one of the best martial actors in China) I was a little disappointed in the story line especially the ending. It was a little too cliche and reminded me of too many of the plots from other movies. Ip Man 1 was more interesting in that it showed how he became a great fighter and how he always kept the principles of his art through thick and thin.

I would recommend this movie, however as I like the star Donnie Yen and the way he represented Ip Man. It still has plenty of action and the plot is definitely worth seeing.",1279411200,,772,4.1466666666666665
4381531,4,B004I11VZ0,"So this movie hit theaters in Hong Kong 2.5 months ago and I just saw it on dvd... figures that the video quality on the disk was pretty bad, but that's the price I pay for these bootlegs (bought elsewhere, not on Amazon).  Anywho, I think the original was better for having more story, a bit more drama, but this sequel has more action for sure, as much as they could squeeze in.  I'd like to thank director Wilson Yip for ONCE AGAIN directing a movie that saw Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung fight.  I knew that was coming, and it was amazing, as was all the action, but there were a couple big surprises for me, mainly because I just didn't know much going in.  First, Yen has a fight right before Sammo with the one and only LO MENG!!!  The other surprise was that the second half of this movie is just like Rocky IV.  Yes, really, thought the entire thing would be about rival schools, but that's just the first half.  The first half is still superior, but the second wasn't too much of a letdown.  You still get to see Yen do his thing.  A couple characters came back from the original film that didn't need to, and they felt obligated to address Bruce Lee in the end, but I'm still saying this is a must-see for action fans due to the modern-day miracle and action god that is Donnie Yen.  He is to be treasured for sure.",1278892800,,1322,4.2103174603174605
4381532,5,B004I11VZ0,I received the movie today. And I thought the movie was excellent and I especially liked the fight scene between Donnie Yen and Samo Hong.

4381533,3,B004I11VZ0,"Great movie but not as good as the first one (But that is standard with all sequels) After doing some research on who is IP MAN, You realise that Ip was 42 years old at the time of Japanese War in 1935 (Born 1893) and was fit enough to take on threats and keep the legacy of Wing Chun going. Dislikes, The English Subtitles in this film is really poor and when the British people speak English in this film, they still do not make sense. It feels as if they threw any words in there. Please wait until the official DVD comes out.",1277769600,11,529,4.096153846153846
4381534,2,B004I11VZ0,"IP Man 2 was a disappointment. It turned into a Rocky wanna-be movie. The only redeeming part of the movie was Sammo Hung's acting skill and the fighting sequence between Sammo's character and Donnie. Not enough character development on the new characters. Quite a few supporting characters from the first movie are in this sequel. I recommend watching it once but don't expect the same caliber as the first movie. Cute scene at the very end of the movie. The beginning storyline was interesting but by the middle of the movie, the story took a dramatic turn and suddenly, it is the Chinese ""Rocky"" movie. Good thing Donnie's character didn't yell out ""Adrian"" at the end of the fight. ooops, wrong movie! ;P The first one was so good. The sequel is a big let-down. I can see why Donnie didn't want to do another sequel.",1276473600,9,820,4.623287671232877
