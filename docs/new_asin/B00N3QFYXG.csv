6608815,5,B00N3QFYXG,The hype is for real! The is the first 4K movie with Dolby Vision. And if you have the right setup (4K TV Dolby Vision TV & An OPPO 203 or 205 Bluray Player) you'll be in for the most amazing picture. Dolby Vision made this movie a beautiful experience. I have watched it now 2 times already.,1497052800,8,292,4.051724137931035
6608816,5,B00N3QFYXG,"This review is focused more on the technical side than the movie itself:

Despicable Me is the first 4K UHD title to be released in ""Dolby Vision""; Dolby Vision is an alternate to the more commonly used ""HDR 10"" version of HDR (High Dynamic Range). HDR allows for better contrast (brighter colors, darker blacks and better color/tone mapping) than Blu-Ray (or other media), allowing for a nicer overall picture.

To get this, you need a 4K UHD TV with HDR (for DolbyVision your TV needs to support Dolby Vision also), a 4K UHD Player that supports Dolby Vision (currently the Oppo 203 does, via firmware update, but most players do not).

The benefit to Dolby Vision over HDR10 is that HDR10 locks the entire movie into a single HDR setting. Since scenes change constantly in a movie (dark scenes, bright scenes) it's hard to pick just 1 setting to lock it into. Dolby Vision allows for dynamic settings to be encoded throughout, so each scene can be set completely different, and it really shows off great in this one!

As someone who owns about 50 different UHD/4K titles in HDR10, this one is the best my TV has ever looked (the brightest picture and most colorful picture). For that alone, I feel it's worth picking up.

The movie is now 7 years old and I think it shows; the picture is incredibly sharp but the CG does seem a little dated with lots of completely round objects.. this is also partly due to the style of the movie. Despicable Me 2 is also in Dolby Vision and a newer movie (obviously :) ) so it will likely look a bit better. I'm hoping to pick that one up shortly.

The set also includes the Blu-Ray release and a Digital Copy.

NOTE: If you are running your 4K UHD player through an AV receiver, if it does not support dolby vision (Most manufacturers have said they'll firmware update any 2016 and newer models), you won't be able to pass the DV signal. If you have a player like the Oppo 203 which has 2 HDMI outputs (1 for video, 1 for audio) you'll be fine.",1496793600,22,1983,4.431318681318682

6608832,5,B00N3QFYXG,"One has to wonder how bad live-action films have become
these days when considering that the very best films of the
year are those that were animated.  While many critics placed
Toy Story 3 and How To Train Your Dragon at the top of their
favorite lists, I think that Despicable Me may take the crown
as the very best animated film of the year.

In fact, this was perhaps the most fun I have had watching
a film on my display this year.  It's such a pleasure to watch
a finished project that is so cleverly written and animated, silly
and heartwarming that you want to see it again as soon as it ends.

In a world of villains,  Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is trying
to take the credit as being the ""baddest"" of them all despite
the fact he never seems to please his abusive Mother (voiced
by Julie Andrews).  When he's not dreaming up evil capers he's
tormenting young children or cutting in front of lines at the local
coffee shop by zapping patrons with his ice blaster.

Problem is, Gru is being outwitted by a new, young villain
named Vector (voiced by Jason Segal) who has just ""upped
the game"" by stealing one of the great Egyptian Pyramids.
To make matters worse, Gru cannot obtain the financing he
needs for his latest big heist -- to steal the moon -- without
the use of a shrinking-ray gun that is tightly locked up in
Vector's lair.

Light Bulb!  Gru gets the idea of adopting 3 cute orphan
girls to help him break into Vector's lair.  With the aid of
Dr. Nefario's (Russell Brand) robot cookies he uses the
orphans as a front to steal the prized possession.
Unfortunately for Gru, he is now forced to take on parenting
responsibilities as a side job which is certainly no fun
when you are trying to dominate the world with evilness.

The scene stealers of this entire film are the yellow
Tylenol-shaped army of ""minions"" who aid Gru with his
mayhem. These squeaky creatures chew through scene
after scene garnering the biggest laughs since Pixar introduced
those green claw-worshiping aliens in Toy Story.  One could
only hope that Universal comes up with a starring vehicle for
those little creatures some time in the near future.

So let's talk about the 3D aspect of Despicable Me.  In a word, it's PERFECT.

The image quality is razor sharp.  Flawless.  There is an amazing sense of
depth and dimension with unparalleled detail, textures and colors.  Check out
the smallest intricate touches like sun rays and sun spots that add to the amazing
level of layered 3D.  You truly get the sense that you are looking out a window
with the ability to touch the action.  I dare you to be disappointed by the roller
coaster ride that Gru takes with the orphans.  It's one of those moments where
you really feel that you are getting your money's worth from your 3D hardware
purchase.

And people like myself who love ""In Yo' Face"" moments (without being too
gimmicky) are going to have their fill here.  There is always some object
looking to break that 4th wall --- whether it be Gru's nose, Dr. Nefaro's hands,
a unicorn's horn, or even shards of ice.  And if that's not enough, the
filmmakers saved the best for last....the end credits.  When those credits
roll do not hit the stop button or you will be missing some of the funniest,
most effective 3D that the film has to offer.

Ghosting?  It's practically non-existent which I find to be a miracle given
that I can pick it out every time.  You have to give kudos to Universal for
the quality of authoring done here.  The only time I saw ghosting was the
film's title card and a sequence involving a floating ballet ticket.
However, in the scheme of things, you are talking seconds of ghosting
in a film that runs for 95 minutes.

The only aspect of this film I found underwhelming was its audio track.
While the Blu-ray boasts DTS HD Master Audio, I found it to be lacking
to other films I have recently heard.  Dialogue is crisp and never
overshadowed by the film's music or effects.  There is some nice
right to left dialogue directionality. There's some ample LFE activity
present, most notably in Vector's lair when the shark hits the glass
tank or during a rocket launch.  The problem is, surrounds are pretty
much non-existant.  You would hope that the movie would immerse
you in the crowd of chattering, cheering minions.  Instead the soundtrack
remains almost entirely front-heavy.  I can forgive it for all the other
plusses that have already been talked about here.

CONCLUSION

For the past two months I have been watching just about
every 3D title that is currently on the market (with the
exception of Avatar, Ice Age 3, How To Train Your Dragon
and Coraline). The reason those titles have yet to be reviewed
here is because they are currently bundled with hardware
and we have to jump through a lot of hoops to get a copy.
We will be reviewing some them very shortly.

The point I am making is that everything I have seen to
date has been lacking in one area or another.  You have great
3D but lots of ghosting; You have great 3D but poor content/story;
You have poor 3D but great content/story.

Despicable Me is the very first title I have watched that has
finally brought all the essential elements together that make
for the perfect 3D experience.  Despicable Me is exquisitely
animated and could easily be mistaken for Pixar fare.  The film
floats on its merits of having cute, charming, adorable characters
and enough big laughs to keep adults and children entertained
throughout. It is perfect family entertainment that will also be
one of the first discs you demo when having friends over.  It is
the very best 3D title that I have gotten my hands on so far.

This is 3D nirvana!  Perfect scores all around!

Do not buy a 3D display without including this title!",1453075200,,5747,4.561951219512195

8676093,5,B00N3QFYXG,"This is a review of the 4k Blu-ray with a very good DTS-X soundtrack.
The movie is one of the more enjoyable animated films to come out over the past few years. While it is a kids movie there is definitely enough here for adults to enjoy this film. I was very concerned when previews first came out that the minions would drag the movie down. I was never so happy to be wrong. The minions add great comic relief to the movie and Steve Carell does a fantastic job as Gru with help from Russell Brand (Dr Nefario) and Jason Segel (Vector). All three roles are played perfectly as to not go over the top with their performances. The 3 girls do a great job of giving real emotion where it's needed most and keep the movie from becoming too silly.
The Video - the upgrade from Blu-ray to 4k is most noticeable in the use of HDR providing a deeper and stronger colors palate. There is not a lot of texture that can be improved upon. There are a few scenes where details are a little sharper such as the opening sequence in Egypt but it's not a huge improvement that Blu-ray viewers would feel like they are missing out.
The audio is a good improvement on an already good mix. The DTS-X soundtrack makes good use of overhead speakers and does a good job of making the entire movie just feel fuller.
IMHO If you own the Blu-ray version you only need to upgrade if you are a big fan of the movie. I'm happy with the 4k but even happier that I got it on sale.",1514246400,2,1449,4.178571428571429
