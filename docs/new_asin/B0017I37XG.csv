8265983,5,B0017I37XG,"I am not a big fan of science fiction movies, but this one held my interest because it deals with the human mind.  In a nutshell, the doctor believed that there is this 'spirit' world connected to a person's mind, and when one is in a coma another person who is close to the one in a coma might be able to 'reach' him or her if both are put together in this other mental world.  I found the movie to be very interesting.  It is also refreshing to watch a movie with no bad language or other questionable parts.

This movie comes in two versions: 'The Last Door' and 'The Lazarus Child.'  One difference is that 'The Lazarus Child' is seven minutes longer than 'The Last Door.'  While both movies have basically the same content, they are arranged very differently; it isn't that they took the longer movie and edited out 'unneeded' parts.  The way they are arranged, and parts left out, create a very different emphasis in the story.  The American version, 'The Last Door,' has much more emphasis on the authorities trying to shut down the doctor's clinic in Alberta, Canada.  The European version, 'The Lazarus Child,' gives much stronger emphasis on the family relationships, and it has a slightly different ending.

So, scenes pertaining to the legal problems of the clinic, included in 'Lost Door,' are cut out of the 'Lazarus' movie, giving it even more than just seven more minutes difference of dealing with the family.  I don't think it is giving anything away to say that the little girl, Frankie, comes out of her coma; viewers would feel cheated if they watched a whole movie of efforts to save her only to see her die.

Because they are having trouble bringing  Ben and Frankie back from this 'other world,' the doctor goes under as well to try to convince them to come back.  [Both kids seems to feel safe in the other world and don't really see the need to come back.]  In 'Last Door,' all three seem to come back at the same time.  However, in 'Lazarus' Ben and Jackie come back to consciousness, but the doctor doesn't.  So, Ben insists on going back to convince the doctor to come back as well.  You'll have to watch the movie to see if he succeeds!

All in all, both my wife and I liked 'Lazarus' better than 'Last Door' because of the greater emphasis on the family relationship.  This is one psychological, science fiction movie that should be okay for most school age children to watch.  There is nothing that would be of concern to traditional values families.  It deals with an accident, so some children might be sensitive to that.  In conclusion, 'Lazarus' gets an 'A' rating and 'Last Door' gets only a 'B+.'",1234224000,5,2634,4.5456475583864115
