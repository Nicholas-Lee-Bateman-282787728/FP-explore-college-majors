8112567,2,B000EPM478,"I agree with a couple other posters, this video has a lot of ""canned"" content that is probably used over and over in this companies videos.  Also the Blue Crane Digital video was more informative and generally far better produced.  This video does have a decent amount of content for the D200, but the Blue Crane Digital video is ALL about the D200.  Both have some basic info for beginers that some may find ""beneath"" their skill level, but the both have some good info for anyone who isn't extremely familiar with the layout of this particular camera.  If I was only buying one I'd definitely buy the Blue Crane DVD over this one.",1236902400,,632,4.517543859649122
8112568,4,B000EPM478,"The DVD was fantastic. The instruction was very well organized and it focused on the most important features of the camera. They didn't just talk about the D200, they talked about photography basics as well. If you're a pro it might not be the best DVD for you because they do spend a lot of time teaching techniques to taking better pictures using the D200",1187568000,15,357,4.507692307692308
8112569,4,B000EPM478,"The Nikon D200 has so many features, it can be a bit daunting to familiarize oneself with them all.  This DVD goes over these feature nicely, but do yourself a favor and don't try to take it all in during a single sitting.  It could prove to be overwhelming, hence the DVD that you can take your time watching and learning about the D200.",1173225600,3,338,4.265625
8112570,2,B000EPM478,"I was expecting some interesting points about the camera and how to use etc. But basically both the CD's shows where the menu's are and some explanations of it. That is it. I have a feeling that 50-60% of the contents are generic, they attach with every video and rest about menus. Not impressed at all.",1172102400,3,303,4.428571428571429
8112571,5,B000EPM478,"This is really an in-depth training DVD (in fact two DVDs). You learn not only  how the camera works, all the menus but also receive unique tips and hints nowhere else available. It is really indispensible for taking great pictures with your new Nikon D200 camera.",1148774400,7,264,4.739130434782608
8112572,1,B000EPM478,"I thought the presentation was just average. I had hoped that the video would spend more time showing you the features and allowing you to duplicate it with your camera; sought of allowing you to ""get the feel of the camera."" Nagy does go through all of the features but it is just that...He points to where they are found and that is all...I could have gotten this from reading the manual. I also got the sense that he was going faster through the more complicated features as the video progressed. Nikon's menu's are easy to follow and more thorough. Didn't need a video to do just that..don't waste your money..disappointed.",1148688000,11,627,4.657657657657658
8112573,5,B000EPM478,"This is a very good DVD to assist you with understanding the menus inside the Nikon D200. When I begin to watch the DVD I didn't think it would be helpful. However, disc 2 proved itself to be immensely valuable.

I avoided many in-camera menu features on my D70 Camera because of the various auto provided programs that comes with the camera (I.e. portrait, landscape, macro, etc.,) or I shot mostly in manual mode; however that kind of grace is not a component of the D200; therefore, it is necessary to learn how to understand and use the menus well to create various programs and shooting styles as well as understand the camera's features.

Also, to compliment your learning I recommend that you purchase Blue Crane Digital's ""Introduction to the Nikon D200"" DVD. The presenter gives you in-depth training on all the features, buttons and some basic photographic tips for using the camera. Both DVD's together, make the perfect marriage.

So, if you choose to avoid frustration and struggle in learning how to use the Nikon D200 menus right away, buy this DVD!",1145923200,13,1064,4.80327868852459
8112574,5,B000EPM478,This training presentation consists of two DVDs - very informative and presentd in an encouraging way. You really will know how to operate this wonderful camera in no time. The authors give you not only facts but a lot of very useful tips and tricks that you will not find in the manual. I think it is a must-have for every Nikon D200 owner.,1143763200,17,341,4.34375
