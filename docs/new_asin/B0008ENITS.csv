8055718,5,B0008ENITS,"Eventhough I'm a 32 year old single male, I am not well versed in porn movies.  The extent of my knowledge is based on the clips I see on the internet, this is only the second movie I have ever purchased.  That being said, here is my review.

First, you should know, that if you have seen clips of this series on the internet, this disc is, basicly, is R-rated.  Each disc in this series has an R-rated version that you can buy at Amazon.com, and a xxx version that you can only buy at few select adult sites (the disc usualy sell for twice the price of the R-rated disc).  The discs that Amazon.com sells show the sex scences from various angles so that the viewer never get's an up close version of the action.  Durring oral sex the only thing you see the back of the girl's hair, and the man's torso.

From what I can tell, some of the more provactive scences, like the race to see who can have an orgasem first, didn't make it onto the other R-rated discs.  One of the bonuses on this disc, is that it includes, all of the R-rated versions of the strip-teases from the other episodes.  Here is an example of how one striptease is differnt between the R-rated and xxx rated discs.  In the r-rated disc, Sarah does a strip-tease while washing the producer's.  This version is sort of like the Paris Hilton Carl's Jr. ad.  In the xxx rated version, Sarah licks the soap off the car's windshield, and has some fun with where she put the sponge.

What was really fasinating to me was listening to Ginge Lynn give her comments.  One thing that stuck in my mind was when she said ""those of us who are true porn-stars, aren't just having sex when the camera's are onn, we have more sex off camera than we do on, we do every-body.""  I hope this review helps you decide whether or not to purchase this disc.",1121644800,20,1801,4.271386430678466
