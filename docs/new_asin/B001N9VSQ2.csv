8417514,4,B001N9VSQ2,"Are you a lover of rare and whacked out cinema? Has a half lifetime of six pack soaked movie nights left you sighing, ""well i guess I've seen all the good stuff"". Well hold on a second. You need this movie in your life! It's hard to capture in brief words exactly what this movie is, it's like trying to describe a flavor. It's weird and hokey, but blissfully unaware of just what it is. It's meant for kids but I think it falls more in line with the stoner crowd. One copy was presented to me and a friend as mad mikes super video closed its doors for good, passed on like a war heirloom. It's hard to find, it'll never make DVD. If you run across it. Buy it!",1417564800,,660,4.0458015267175576
