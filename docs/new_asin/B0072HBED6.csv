8508921,5,B0072HBED6,Really cool foreign film with haunting score. Hope this director makes more like this. Not a sex movie at all except for a few well placed scenes that fit the story. It shows how hard it would be for other creatures to understand each others alieness and ideas.,1414713600,2,261,4.458333333333333
8508922,5,B0072HBED6,"Air doll is for those that like seriously ambiguous films, it starts with a love doll that feels unsatisfied just being a thing to love and comes alive one day while her lover isn't at home...her first word was simply...beautiful...as she gazes at the rain droplets clinging to the window sill...here i felt a yearning tugging foreboding feeling something was going to happen later on in the film. Anyhow the love doll goes out into the world and learns all she can learn...finding herself meeting various people with problems of their own one for example a lonely old man who always sits at the park waiting for someone anyone to just be with him. Later on the love doll encounters a man who works at a video shop, he and the love doll become inseparable companions, the love doll finally happy is with the man until the very end, and the end is quite bittersweet to say the least...",1410307200,,884,4.566037735849057
8508923,5,B0072HBED6,"Air Doll!!!  I love love love the story to this movie!  It's very poetic, artistic, unique and tragic.  The fantasy/plot is bright then turns dark!  If one has a big imagination and think about everything that could possibly go right and wrong you'll understand why some fantasy should remain a fantasy!",1398816000,3,303,4.882352941176471
8508924,5,B0072HBED6,"A very paced and intelligent movie. It includes things which are not pretty, and things that are. Many people say it is a love story that goes suddenly bad in an illogical way, but I think that is not correct. The movie shows how we all start out innocent and perfect creations, only wanting to find someone else who mutually breaths purpose and happiness into our lives. The allegory stated is that we are like flowers basically waiting for a breeze to match us up to someone who can pollinate our souls.

SPOILERS

In this story the doll -- gets a heart (life and cognitive abilities) -- basically the soul looking for that perfection and happiness. Everyone she meets is unfulfilled, and stuck in a very material and surface understanding of life -- artificially and selfishly thinking they are all that is important -- which leads to bad behaviors and motives -- people using her to pacify their own hollowness without celebrating her being the possible match to complete themselves -- so she is a sex toy, someone to take advantage of, a substitute for that perfection.

Symbolically, her ""owner"" - filled her with an air pump -- when she meets the person she feels completes her she toss out the pump, as she want him to fill her instead which gave them both a deep sense of satisfaction and happiness. Allegorically -- when you find the right man/woman -- you no longer need to satisfy yourself artificially.

In the end everyone betrayed her -- literally everyone saying they were hollow and not even really looking for someone who they wanted to MUTUALLY complete. They ALL settled for a ""substitution"" and in her final stages, she realized she too is destined ""by her nature"" to be treated as a substitute.

Her boyfriend betrays her in the end -- probably because he was blinded by his own sadness and disappointment and only looking inwardly. She offers to do anything he wants and believes he will want her to fill him with life, as he did to her, but instead he asks her to end his pain (selfish - inward response).

In fact when he saves her by inflating her, and they are both dizzy with delight and satisfaction -- she wants him to fill her up more, and he instead asks about how painful being deflated was -- she said very painful - but the contrast with being filled with love and someone to celebrate her life was worth the pain.

So she is thinking to give, they are thinking to receive. In other words, she is seeking ways to gain happiness and completeness -- the beauty of life. But everyone else was looking for ways to escape the pain of life.

In the end -- all the people -- the people who ""a breeze"" brought into her life (or she breezed into their lives) never knew the potential for completeness -- love, happiness, purpose -- she embodied. The amazing acting by her at the end as she imagines all the people she met and felt were beautiful and interesting -- celebrating her life and existence -- she did a perfect laugh/cry/sob to echo the irony. The irony was that one by one these people treated her as something not real -- a substitute to take selfish advantage of. In that scene she also imagines the satisfaction of being able to eat (fill her hollowness with something real), celebrating growing old (birthday) with friends sharing the of journey of her life in celebration.

How many times do we fail to celebrate the lives of people we meet, because we only care about escaping our personal pain; the ""what's in it for me."" How many times do people treat and see us as a means to their own ends. Far to often, and many (if honest) would say they do not care about hurting others if they get benefits by being that way. I thought it was a profound and good movie.

The ending is horribly honest -- and is intended to ""give people a shake"" on what they are doing to in relationships. People I think were upset because the pacification is so true with many people -- and it ends up asking -- are these badly behaved people similar to ourselves? Are you damaged - trying to find happiness by indulging yourself - only to find disappointment because once your buzz is finished, your emptiness is still there.

I think this movie has a well paced and logical storyline. It is abrupt because it is contracting an allegory to real life in an abrupt way, and when it does that, it is a bit shocking. I would recommend it. Doona Bae is outstanding all the way through. I personally believe they could have showed a more positive end - so we can see ""good"" win - but the viewer is left feeling pretty hollow -- I'm not sure if that is good or bad -- but the fact that it makes us ponder how we behave in relationships is a good one.

Symbols: Apples appear throughout, symbolically not being eaten and ending up in the garbage, this is symbolic of the unfulfilled potential of that apple to satisfy someones hunger. The bottles and objects she takes from the garbage, symbolize the things we don't even notice and see as garbage (no potential), but she see as beautiful.",1397520000,10,5001,4.501653803748622
8508925,5,B0072HBED6,"I love this movie and I am so happy to finally own it. Bae Doona is one of my favorite Korean actresses, and she is perfect in her roll as a curious blow up doll who spontaneously come to life. The over all story is a little sad but still heart warming. There are some references to the little mermaid in the movie which I think fit perfectly with the theme. I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of quirky Japanese dramas. The box is pretty awesome too. The back description and title menu is in Thai as well as English.",1387756800,5,530,4.105769230769231
8508926,5,B0072HBED6,"Wonderfully sad story about loneliness. The Japanese give you a few moments of joy and happiness in between tragedy and sorrow.  Doona Bae is fantastic, like the role was made for her.  Don't listen to critics on this, they can't ever like anything.  Watch it and enjoy as is.  The poem scene is absolutely beautiful.",1379116800,5,317,4.709090909090909
8508927,5,B0072HBED6,"Yes, its excellent but not for everybody. It quite slow and message is hidden, and, generally, look into reality as is and into the future as it sure will be here. Music is strange, simple and depressing, not much of Tokyo, but most annoying is reality where government regulate our private lives without our consent and consider themselves higher than God. Gee, movie is kinda depressing and not recommended for weaklings. I should add that
""Glamorous life of Sachiko Hanai"" has similar imagination but in a different way.
Update: Imdb gives original 126 minutes of film and I couldn't find it so far and my guess is erotic parts are victims.",1359504000,,643,4.801801801801802
8508928,5,B0072HBED6,"A very intriguing movie, but not only for the movie itself also for the meaning & concept of loneliness.
A fantasy, a dream, a delirium. Your choice.",1359331200,7,149,4.555555555555555
8508929,5,B0072HBED6,"At first I was not sure what to think about this movie when I heard about it, but after watching it I can say this is one of those movies that has a good message in it that anyone can understand. If you are a fan of Anime, I think this has the same feel as one. The acting is good, and the story is well written with parts that are both heartwarming and sad. Worth checking out.",1356393600,8,378,3.858974358974359
