  Storyline
The story of a Ah Zhen who devotes her life to her husband and daughter. She will go to any length to make him happy and to help him get the promotion. She loves to save money in any way she can to help her family's finances. One day she starts to plan a party for her husbands boss that might help with a promotion. She came up with a party theme centered around a copy of a blue and white porcelain vase.  The type his boss loves. She finds one and try's to get a discount on it, but the shopkeeper won't budge on the price. She goes to talk to her sister in law and decides to give it one last try.  She meets Lan Tien Wei , played by Chris Wang, who has just bought the to vase. She begs him for it and he refuses to sell it to her, even for a little extra money. She snatches the vase and stuffs money in his pocket. As she walks out she trips and falls, breaking the vase. As he smiles and walks off.  Later she mistakes him for a poor insurance salesman and they become friends. She explains that she wanted the vase because of how much she loves her husband and wants to support his career. He decides to lend her a priceless vase and telling her it is a fake. Meanwhile her cousin Wei An moves into her house who has arrived from America and has no where else to live. She gives Rui Fan, played by James Wen, a shock to see her sleeping with out clothes and a thin blanket. She slowly worms her way into the family as a nice, sweet person. She gets a job with Rui Fan and slowly destroys this faithful husbands marriage. This really destroys An Zhen life as he carries on his affair and still they both live at the house. They sneak around a lot. When he gets caught he tells his wife that it's nothing.  Lan Tien Wei had spotted her husband out with Wei An and debates telling her about it. She thought that her husband was having an affair with the beautiful ex girlfriend at work. But found out she was wrong. As she falls apart when he finally leaves her , Lan Tien Wei  helps her to learn how to be good to yourself. That it's ok to dress nicely and use makeup. She uses her new look and gets a job selling cars. It's a surprise later that Lan Tien Wei is the secret new boss. She gets into an accident while a client test drives a car. And her husband shows up and forces her to sign divorce papers. He physically makes her do it. I hated this part the most, even if he did provide financially for his daughter and let her keep the house.  Lan Tien Wei was there when she was unconscious and when she first woke up. He was amazed that her first words were to see if the client was ok. Later she gets the nickname Ms Negative Sales as she got tricked by him and took a car before he became the official boss. Lan Tien Wei decides to help her to win her husband back. She moves into his house with her ex husband taking care of their daughter as she recovers. She learns how to walk and talk. How to hint that she wants him but not to let him have the upper hand, always leave him wanting more. They even pretend to date. At this point Rui Fan has lost everything and him and Wei An are living in her house together. There is so much that happens in this show. She gets a spot on a cooking show and everyone loves her and she bravely tells the world that she's divorced. That there was someone else that caused it but she felt her ex husband was brave to fight for his love. She becomes so popular she gets her own show and Wei An gets jealous and tells reporters that An Zhen was the one who cheated. Eventually the truth comes out. They get kicked out of the house when he sleeps with Wei An in her bed. Lan Tien Wei has finally realized he loves her but she's afraid of love now. He loves her enough to help her with her ex husband if she wants him. Smart woman that she is she doesn't want him anymore.  Wei An gets pregnant then leaves permanently. She has mental problems throughout the show. Ah Zhen leaves her show wanting a normal life. She obviously loves Alan Tien Way but can't commit. He decides to leave and travel the world and become the type of man who deserves her love. As he travels the world he writes articles in the paper and send messages to her in them as Ms Negative Sales. Her ex husband starts to come around too. When the show ends she is at a book signing by him and they shake hands. But the series leaves you hanging.  The order may not exactly be correct but the story might help you decide. So buy the movie for the end and you will be happy you did. I recommend this drama for anyone. But for me this drama has a strong message about how to become a stronger person after divorce. Yes, this is the drama for that. The set is very durable and I have watched about a dozen times and the quality doesn't lessen.  I hope you enjoy this drama and the movie. I will be reviewing about 200 Korean/ Chinese/ Taiwanese dramas and CDs.

8459911,5,B0056VPR2E,"In THE FIERCE WIFE, the entire cast is in a ferocious struggle with their respective partners. Most Taiwanese television dramas do revolve around conflict but it is rare to find one like this that places such conflict as the structuring theme. At the heart of this core of conflict lies the seemingly peaceful ten year marriage of a perfectly matched couple, Xie An Zhen (Sonia Sui) and husband Wen Rui Fan (James Wen). Everyone notes and compliments them on their lack of conflict. Into this pool of bliss steps Li Wei En (Amanda Zhu), the younger cousin of Xie An Zhen. Wei  En immediately begins a seduction of her in-law, one that does not take long to occur. Rui Fan tells Wei En that the previous ten years of his marriage have drained him of spark and joy. Initially, we in the audience do not yet know whether he is simply saying that to bed Wei En but he quickly asserts the truth of his disenchantment by telling An Zhen he wants a divorce. It is painful for the viewer to see a previously well-mannered husband morph into a demon of callousness. This changeover suggests that he truly was not happy in his marriage and his affair was not the cause of his divorce but rather a byproduct of it. An Zhen is crushed as she has to face the need to survive without him as her marital fulcrum. She suffers and cries, but with the help of family and friends, she endures.

The second fierce pair is Rui Fan and Wei En. The latter is as explosive and volatile as An Zhen is reticent, a difference that implies that Rui Fan clearly makes the right emotional choice. Much of the tragedy of THE FIERCE WIFE is that an enduring marriage is not based only on pure emotion; there must be the calm give and take that marked the decade marriage of Rui Fan and An Zhen. The extreme of the former is just as corrosive as the extreme of the latter. Wei En comes across as a Taiwanese version of the crazed Alex from FATAL ATTRACTION. Wei En is brutal, vicious, arm-biting, and totally self-centered yet Rui Fan has ample opportunity to note this but still chooses to remain by her side despite the very heavy financial price he must pay with alimony and loss of house and job. He refuses to be fiercely honest with himself even as he is totally fierce with An Zhen in securing his ill-fated divorce.

A third fierce pair is An Zhen's relation with her grumpy boss, Lan Tien Wei (Chris Wang), who is fierce with her as he mocks her and equally fierce with her as he realizes that he loves her. He gradually becomes a better more caring human being even as An Zhen grows a shell of toughness that renders her increasingly attractive to Rui Fan who now acknowledges his mistake.

A final pair of fiercely contesting lovers is Rui Fan's sister Wen Rui Huan (Hu Ying Zheng) a volatile wife who has been hurt by the affairs of her husband Hao Kang De (Patrick Li) and as a result engages in non-stop slapping, punching, and verbally abusing him in every scene. Oddly enough she finds Lan Tien Wei sexually attractive and at several points she offers herself to him.

While all this bickering is going on, behind it all lie some basic and upsetting truths about the need to compromise in a marriage. When compromise and truthful self-introspection do not occur, basic decency goes out the window and the results are sadly predictable. I had a hard time deciding whether to root for a properly remorseful Rui Fan (who in a heartbreaking attempt at reconciliation bears his soul to an uncaring An Zhen) and tries to patch up his marriage after Wei En exits for America or to accept Tien Wei as the logical choice for An Zhen. The ending shows the gap between the journeys taken by Rui Fan and Wei En and that taken by An Zhen. Hers was the infinitely more difficult choice. Her reply to An Zhen (""I can't go back"") is a firm commitment  to her new-found and hard-won self image as one who can now center her life on only her achievements.  Her parting handshake at the film's close to Tien Wei has been taken by various reviewers as a sign that she has chosen him. I disagree since this handshake follows directly his fear that such a handshake means no more than one friend greeting another. THE FIERCE WIFE is an uncompromising look at what fierceness means when that fierceness is directed only at others. An Zhen would add that the major struggle must always begin and end with one's own self.",1405641600,5,4379,4.46625
