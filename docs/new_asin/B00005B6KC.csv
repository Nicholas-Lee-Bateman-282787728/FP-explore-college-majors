7936876,5,B00005B6KC,"Thanks to DVD many obscure and interesting old films and television shows are gradually becoming more readily available. Orson Welles' ""Around the World"" television series is scarcely mentioned in biographies and filmographies. It is pleasing to see the episodes retrieved from history on DVD. A collection of episodes on another DVD ommitted ""The Dominici Affair"" and now I understand why. The DVD producers saved it up for this very special documentary presentation. The original episode is missing footage and the filmmakers have added bridging dialogue and still photos. Also: The little known incident of the Dominici murder required more background info for the modern audience. This is an exceptional DVD for Orson Welles's fans.",1291161600,,736,5.464912280701754
7936877,3,B00005B6KC,"I had already seen a documentary about this case on the History Channel. When I viewed Welles' version for the first time it made me realize something I already knew: genius is also a wonderful aid when simply confronting reality (documentary). In the History Channel version, you are left with the impression that the crazy peasants just went off their rockers. Welles zeroes in on a crucial detail: one of the idiot sons undammed water and forgot about it, flooding the property. The old man paced around convinced ruin was upon him. The shots of him wondering what was going to happen to the land at the end, in a psychotic daze complete the picture. Too bad Welles didn't make about a hundred movies like this. This is a fascinating vignette; almost like finding a set of characters from a Zola novel, still alive in the 20th C, facing the end of the line.",1006905600,7,860,4.590909090909091
7936878,2,B00005B6KC,"This VERY short disc (52 min) features the 26 min entry from ""Around the World With Orson Welles"". Made for France Public Television it was supressed and not aired for years. Normally I would be overjoyed at a new Welles release however there are mutiple reasons to make this disc a ""possible"" depending on your interest in Orson Welles.
By far the first is that the master audio featuring Welles narration is lost. They re-create it with another actor. A disappointment. The only voice of welles are at parts of the docu on the docu that fill out the 52 minutes.
Secondly this show is part of ""The Around The World With Orson Welles"" and along with another of the series WAS NOT included in the ""Around the World"" disc. Image Entertainment ,the makers of both discs appears to be double dipping. I expect to see the final ""missing"" ""Around the World"" appear later this year from Image for another 20 bucks.
I try to not buy from Image Entertainment whenever possible. Poor disc extras. Frequent nickel and diming of the customers and VERY high prices for disc that look like Warner Brothers Value $12.99 disc. Not enhanced for HDTV. No special features and the annoying WB style 'snapper' type discs that cost alot less are especially bothersome when your paying double the price that a WB disc
If your hooked on Welles this is a restored print and looks very nice so you can enjoy all of Welles film skill. Even without his skilled narration this is still a valued product if you have all or almost all of his collection.
 For a more valued priced introduction to Orson Welles on DVD check out some discs from laserlight.
I have the Stranger and The Trail. The Stranger is an excellent restored print however it features a tv type logo that appears about 3 times in the movie. It also features a 30 min docu on Welles The Trial does not have the logo but it is not a restored print (but still o.k.). Mr. Arkadin from the series is not a good selection. It is the U.S. cut of the Welles U.K. film Confidential Report which feature about 10 extra minutes. All three feature an inroduction by Tony Curtis (!?!).",989798400,15,2110,4.5380577427821525
