2155289,5,B00030A5I4,a fabulous way to start losing weight. very easy to follow and fun to do.,1186531200,,73,3.933333333333333
2155290,5,B00030A5I4,This program is great for beginners and people my age (73). The moves are easy to follow and low impact.  Gilad really makes it fun. This is the second DvD I have purchased of Gilad's the first was his 30 and 60 minute workout which is an effective and fun workout. If you are lazy like me and a little stiff Gilad's programs are for you--you not only get a workout but you have fun.  I start everyday with Gilad and feel so much  for better for it.,1172966400,63,449,4.079545454545454
2155291,4,B00030A5I4,"Great colletions of weight loss and toning. I've tried it to date, works awesome!",1163030400,2,81,4.857142857142857
2155292,2,B00030A5I4,"I'm a fan of Gilad's workouts. Updating my collection, I purchased Beginners Weight Loss & Toning Program and The New Best of Bodies in Motion. Sad to say, they are exactly the same. Different label between the two, but if you buy one you do not need the other.",1159488000,43,261,4.346938775510204
2155293,5,B00030A5I4,"Gilad is the easiet instructor to follow. His steps are not complex and very easy to catch onto. This exercise made me sweat plus it is fun. It starts with a quick warm-up and then 3 sequences of cardio the first starts with some step touches with arms....the second is running in place with one leg and a brief bob and weave sequence. the third is some high knees and  then he puts them all together 2 times. then brings your heart rate down.

Then he tones the legs and abs and doesn't use any weights..this exercise is great for beginners one that isn't going to make your face blood red or jump around into cardiac arrest...it is a slow paced exercise...if you have been doing high impact aerobics comfortably then this isn't for you....

What else can I say Gilad has never failed me...I have been exercising with him since the early 90's when i was in Middle School when he was on ESPN and still love him like I did then.",1143590400,32,927,4.3468208092485545
2155294,5,B00030A5I4,"This workout is one long workout rather than a one hour DVD made up of segments from Gilad's workout show.  It's really ideal for those starting out, or for those who want to mix a low impact workout into their exercise routine.  Gilad works out with his regular athletic crew and adds a whole crowd of beginners to follow along with the workout.  It takes place on the beach in Hawaii in front of a hotel and the routine is choreographed to very pleasant Hawaiian tunes played by a live band.  Gilad starts off very basic and explains all the moves and transitions.  He takes you through about 8 different aerobic routines, starting out with the basic moves and adding additional movements once the basics are taught.  Following the aerobics, Gilad walks you through a brief abdominal workout and butt/thigh exercises.  It's not strenous but it will get you moving.  I use it on alternating days with Gilad's more high impact workouts.",1133827200,82,936,4.734567901234568
2155295,5,B00030A5I4,"If you are new to working out, get this DVD.  It is geared to you! You won't hear a bunch of terms you don't know and you won't feel like you are being talked down to.  Will motivate you to buy all of Gilad's DVDs.  He's the best for sure.",1122249600,56,239,3.74
2155298,5,B00030A5I4,"I love Gilad.  He has a very easy-going manner and is obviously enthusiastic about exercising. I switch Gilad dvds out with other fitness dvds and I don't get sick of him like I do with the other instructors.  Yes, the clothes and music are from a different era, but if you want a good workout, try the Gilad series.  I haven't run into a bad one yet.",1495238400,,351,4.208955223880597

MAHALO  gilad. (mahalo is thank you in Hawaiian).
an update--ever since i have been exercising with gilad, my clothes are starting to feel looser!  can't wait for my annual check-up in November.  also, if you don't have time for the full workout, just do the warm up, that is enough to get your blood pumping!",1484784000,4,812,4.302631578947368

The exercises are doable...they are basic movements that are easy to follow and he encourages you to simply walk in place if you get lost or can't do them. He is positive and realistic. He never tries to push past your limits while at the same time encouraging you to stretch yourself.

The steps are very easy, the cardio is broken into 3 segments (so you can sit for a minute and drink some water) then there is a tone section, abs, and cool down.  If I can't do the whole 60 minutes I at least do the first 2 cardio segments.  I am slowly getting in better shape so I can tackle the next step up.

2155371,4,B00030A5I4,"I don't get a lot of exercise in my job.  I like this video because it has a simple scope of exercises that are doable by regular folks.  I also like that Gilad makes it clear to do what you can do and gives safety tips so you practice correctly.  He maintains good cheer and keeps it fun. This training video takes place on what appears to be a beach near a Hawaiian hotel.  There's a semi-live band playing music resembling what I call lounge faux high life / calypso, ska-lite.  (drum machine but live guitar, keyboard and bass and hand percussion.  Gilad has around 20 or so (total) men and women (fitness assistants) following along with his moves on rubber beach mats placed on the sand.  Gilad is on his own beach mat front and center of the camera, and alternating men and women located in the foreground on either side and then to about 50 feet back, all in sync with his movements.  Most of the trainers appear to be late 20's to late 30's in age.  The moves are fairly simple but if you're older and don't want to beat yourself up and yet be motivated...well.. I found it to be a good compromise.  One set in the middle of the video went on long enough that I wish they changed the tune or modulated or something but that's a minor quibble.  I'm guessing the aerobic training in the middle, is probably 120 - 130 beats per minute.  If you're out of shape, just take smaller steps and then work you way up to (a week or so later) high steps (up to the waist).  I do like that Gilad seems to believe in what he is doing and so when you are told things, it's encouraging instead of condescending.  The camera cuts a lot to other workout trainee's, they all seem to be cheerful and energetic.  Think of Gilad as a sort of exercise DJ keeping you on track.  He seems to have come a long way.

I also own another (earlier?)  video of him which I can't recommend (60 & 30 Minutes Low Impact Workout) as he wasn't ""baked yet"". YMMV. It's just my opinion.  On that other video, it's just him, 3 trainer ladies and another guy on a beach with some totally canned music and very static / boring production values.  His hair in that other video looks a bit silly and his delivery and style come across as awkward, trying too hard, a bit less evolved / confident.

SUMMARY:  I can recommend this particular Gilad video (""Beginners Weight Loss & Toning Program"").  I use it.  I like it.  It cheerfully encourages and motivates me and gives me a workout yet does not bark at me or make me feel like an idiot.

P.S.  I found it helpful to obtain a decent, large area (4 X 8 ft), foldable, cushy exercise mat and place it directly in front of my flat screen TV.

2155386,5,B00030A5I4,"This dvd was worth every penny spent and so much more considering the benefits of the workout. When Gilad aired on ESPN so many years ago, I worked out with him every morning, Monday - Friday. At that time I was in the best shape of my life. I am just so happy that I have finally found and have access to Gilad's original workouts!

Gilad is, in my opinion, one of the greatest fitness trainers in history. He is very thorough in explaining the proper use of form, which is such an important factor in reaching your intended goals, whether you are trying to lose weight, build muscle or simply tone your body.

I have tried so many other fitness dvds over the years only because ESPN discontinued airing Gilad after a certain amount of time. I have never been satisfied with any other fitness trainer because, unless you are a well-trained dancer of some sort and you have 2 left feet like me, you just can't keep up. Other fitness trainers claim that you can ""Get Ripped in 90 Days"" and they do exactly that, but you run the risk of injuring your muscles or hamstrings, not to mention that some require the use of a pull-up bar; so, where do you install a pull-up bar in your house, and why would you want to, right?

Believe it or not, you can get ripped in 90 days simply by following along with Gilad's dvds; it's so much safer and you won't be tripping over yourself trying to keep up with the trainer. Gilad walks you through it step by easy step.

This particular dvd focuses mainly on burning fat but it also contains a toning segment. Gilad offers so many different types of dvds like fat burning workouts, dvds that concentrate on specific muscle groups, and full or complete body workouts. He even offers workouts with the use of weights and/or stretch bands. The choices are limitless. In doing my research, I found Amazon.com to offer the widest variety of choices at the most affordable prices.

After you purchase his dvds, take before and after photos if you like, but be sure to listen to Gilad closely and do exactly what he says to do, keeping in mind that a key factor in reaching your goal is sticking with it on a regular basis. Compare your photos after 90 days, however, making comparisons won't be necessary because after just 30 days you'll notice a significant improvement, but after 90 days the proof will be evident because you'll be more fit, slim, toned and/or muscular, depending on the type of workout(s) you choose.

Gilad makes it so easy; the rest is up to you.",1329955200,6,2498,4.479120879120879
2155387,5,B00030A5I4,"He is the best, I used to watch him in the 80's.  I like the low impact, not so much jumping around. Being in Kansas in the winter, it's nice to have the scenery of Hawaii and he is easy on the eyes too. thank you. very fast shipping too.",1329350400,,238,3.76

2155390,5,B00030A5I4,"This is a fun and effective way to get started with aerobics and get a good workout. Gilad does an excellent job of directing movements so I never felt like I was getting lost. The aerobic section is deceptively easy. I thought ""this is not hard enough"" and then I started to sweat. The entire routine is ok for a beginner and I think that you can make it more rigorous if you work at it. All in all, I highly recommend it.",1317513600,,423,4.108433734939759
2155391,5,B00030A5I4,"I just discovered Gilad and I just love this workout video so much that I've bought his classics videos in a set of 5 from his website.  Wanting to continue working out while on vacation after having returned to my pilates reformer a few weeks before, I purchased a kettlebell with a DVD from the local Walmart.  My sister had several Gilad tapes which she brought along with her.  We would do the 5 minute warmup (which in itself is a pretty good workout for a beginner) and then the first segment of the aerobic workout (about 12 minutes).  We would then go into a kettlebell workout for 20-25 minutes more. After that, we would feel we had gotten a pretty good start on our day.

Gilad is on the beach in Hawaii with several individuals working out behind him.  He has a live band playing music with turtle drums, electronic piano, and other island instruments and I like the beat of the music.  Like he says at the beginning, you can make the workout as hard or easy as you like by making bigger or smaller movements.

If you are familiar with aerobic workouts from going to the gym, you will be familiar with many of the moves.  For someone who has never done aerobics, you may have a little trouble with the cuing. However, when Gilad moves into a new move, he does it at least 8 times twice, then 4 times twice and builds several moves on top of the first one.  You will then do all of the set of moves at least 2-3 more times before he goes into a new segment.  The segments glide right into each other and you can either do the entire DVD for about a 50 minute workout or stop at any of the segments and move on with your workout routine with weights.  Your muscles will definitively be warmed up.  After a few times, even the most beginning novice will recognize the steps and be able to keep up.  My goal is at least 20 minutes of Gilad, 20 minutes of kettlebell, 30 minutes of pilates on my reformer, and 10-15 minutes of weight lifting for a really good workout of all my muscles.

One reviewer gave this video a low rating saying that Gilad did not cue into the next move.  He does and he does the moves enough times that even if you lagged you can get caught up.  But like I said a novice who is not familiar with aerobic moves might have a little trouble initially.  But that's the beauty of a DVD, just step in place to keep up your heart rate and rewind!",1316822400,,2372,4.233333333333333

Already I have gone down 1 size and have only been excerising for about 2 weeks. As one person wrote in their review ""if you can overlook the outdated excerise outfits"" you can lose the weight!!

There is a problem on occasion where the camera is focusing on the wrong thing -- for example showing the feet of the background people when Gilad is introducing a new arm movement. As an out of shape beginner, it is beyond my current abilities to do both the cardio and toning sections at the same time. I usually do just the cardio and then stop.

This takes about 40 minutes and is followed by some floor exercises.  If I'm in a hurry, I do the warm-up, the last segment where he goes through everythign twice, and then the cool-down.  That's a good 20-minute workout, and you feel great afterwards!  I lost 20 pounds in 3 months doing Gilad every day and eating a low-fat, high-fiber diet (lots of beans/lentils, veggies, with small amt of whole grains and fruit, and nonfat dairy!).  I feel great!

You will get a thorough workout with any of his DVD's.  What I like best about his methods is that he's always safe.  No moves are performed that will be harmful or damaging. Gilad is the reason that I have been able to keep fit for over 20 years.  He is the first thing I do every morning after feeding the cats.

2155405,2,B00030A5I4,"Picture quality is poor to the point of distraction. What could have been a beautiful seaside aerobics presentation is a video-noisy production with washed-out colors and fat dancing pixels popping up periodically. Images look hazy and out of focus, enough to make anyone dizzy. Also annoying is that every so often the picture suddenly turns a little dark--and then light again, like the double-flicking of a switch. Viewed on a standard-definition TV set, however, the disc's flaws will be less pronounced (except for the light shifts) and somewhat more tolerable (a high-definition TV will magnify video artifacts from crummy sources such as this DVD); therefore, you may want to hold on to your old, reliable tube TV for situations like this. The monophonic sound comes through clearly but as can be expected lacks depth and detail.

If you can manage to get past the fuzz, blur, and pixelation, you will appreciate the excellent aerobics routine, executed with precision by the guru and his talented team. The program is broken down into several segments: Warm Up; Cardio Sequence 1, 2, and 3; Toning / Lower & Upper Body; Toning / Abdominals; and Cool Down. The moves are simple and very nicely choreographed.

Bottom line: This DVD will have you checking whether you are in fact wearing your specs, or it will leave you thinking you need to get a pair.",1197417600,3,1359,4.930131004366812
2155406,5,B00030A5I4,"Excellent DVD.  I use it on the days that it is too rainy to get out and jog.

Gilad's instructions are easy to follow, his move sequences logically build on each other (first feet, feet with a new angle, add one arm at a time, add both arms), and the cues he gives for changing to a new move are perfectly timed and consistent.

Gilad has the perfect attitude also.  He is motivating without coming across as insincere or appearing like a highschool cheerleader.  He also makes important comments on correct positioning without being condescending or militant.

I'm in very good physical condition for my age.  This DVD can make me break a sweat if I really put alot of effort into it (lift the knees high, pump the arms hard).  Alternatively, if I am lazy while I'm doing it, I still get my heart rate elevated a bit and get some toning and stretching benefits, even if I'm not burning as many calories.  This is good because it means any one at any level can derive benefits from the workout. Then as their physical abilities improve they can put more effort into the moves and derive even more benefits.",1192665600,5,1107,4.495

The set and the music is similar to Gilad's TV show... on the beach with some sort of so-so background music.  The routine is a good start for beginners and fairly easy to follow.  There are a couple of places that I can't follow the exact footwork so I just alter the routine.  I love the warm up and the cool down and I can deal with the aerobics but during the abdominal toning I tend to curse at the TV.
