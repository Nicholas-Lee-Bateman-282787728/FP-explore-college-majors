7873351,5,6304483139,"This movie is another Bill Duke masterpiece where he gets behind the cameras in regard to historical events in African American culture... This story is one of the few accounts of the early 1900 migration of African Americans from the sharecropper laborers of the south to the industrial labor factories of the north... The movie sent me online to google documentary information of those events in the past.., Where I found alot more details of labor manipulation, unions, abusive employers, race riots, police brutality, crowded living conditions... This movie is an ""collectors item""... The acting, casting,script are all perfect...",1278892800,5,634,5.414141414141414
