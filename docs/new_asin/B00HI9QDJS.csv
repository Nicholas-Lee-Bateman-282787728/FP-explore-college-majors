Frankly, 'Mademoiselle C,' fashion guru or not, comes across as a vacuous, opinionated bore, who looks as though she needs a good hairdresser and a bath. She's just not in the least bit interesting, and neither is her family or the awful people who surround her. Anna Wintour, Valentino and the wonderful Diana Vreeland were, and are, towering figures in the fashion business. This woman, who is revered in some fashion circles, isn't in the race in my opinion. But if you are aware of her through fashion magazine layouts, and in the fashion business, you might find this interesting. Not for me.",1404518400,,808,4.820143884892087
6166609,5,B00HI9QDJS,"I loved everything about this film. CR is authentic, creative, and inspiring. She reveals herself with candor and high energy, and one can see how her intelligence & warmth have earned her the loyal friendships and partnerships she shares with her fellow artists within the fashion world. Her ""neoclassical/neo-punk"" sensibility is fascinating.
She is the antithesis of Anna Wintour as shown in ""The September Issue,"" and so it's not even worth time comparing. However, that being said, Carine is refreshing and embodies the whole point of fashion.",1403395200,,548,5.310344827586207
6166610,2,B00HI9QDJS,"this movie is just fine
it does not really go into depth
basically it just follows Carine around different functions",1401753600,,116,4.85
6166611,5,B00HI9QDJS,"I've admired Carine R for some time, love her more after seeing this documentay which shows what a warm, down to earth person she is as well as a fabulous style icon. She is inspiring. Love this film.",1396742400,,200,4.2894736842105265
6166612,2,B00HI9QDJS,"A dull film with very little insight into Mademoiselle C, the business of fashion, creativity, design or magazine publishing. It's just one long, boring advertisement for a magazine.",1395705600,5,182,5.535714285714286
6166613,2,B00HI9QDJS,"A Valentine to Ms. Roitfeld and one this does not shed much insight into her as a person, but rather the persona she has created for herself.  Also, the same narrow group of people are interviewed repeatedly which reinforce this persona.",1395705600,3,237,4.780487804878049
6166614,4,B00HI9QDJS,"Mademoiselle C is a documentary about Carine Roitfeld, who ran French Vogue for ten years, building a reputation as one of the fashion worlds most significant influences. Her inner circle includes Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, Karl Lagerfeld, Diane von Furstenberg, and Alexander Wang.

The movie chronicles Roitfelds launch of her own magazine, CR Fashion Book, and gives a behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of her professional and personal lives. We observe major transitions as she moves to New York, starts a new business, and prepares to become a grandmother.

On display are the models, celebrities, and eccentric personalities who make the fashion world so colorful and captivating. Featured are Sarah Jessica Parker, photographer Bruce Weber, supermodels Kate Upton, Linda Evangelista, and Stephanie Seymour, as well as designers Ford, von Furstenberg, Lagerfeld, and Jean Paul Gaultier.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include footage from the Paris premiere.",1395446400,2,983,5.628378378378378
6166615,5,B00HI9QDJS,"I love this video because it shows us what Carine really is, she is an intelligent woman, she knows what she wants and where she is heading, for someone to say no to vogue and start doing her own business that is huge, she took risks and it payed, and on top of that she is an accomplished grandmother and has a stable relationship. This video help us to understand that what you have a project in mind, follow your gut and just do it.

6166617,4,B00HI9QDJS,"""Mademoiselle C."" (2013 release from France; 92 min.) is a documentary about French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld. As the documentary opens, we are in August, 2012, where we learn that Carine is working feverishly to launch a new magazine called ""CR Fashion Book"". The documentary then goes back to late, 2011, with an announcement from Vodue Paris that Roitfeld is leaving after a 10 year stint as editor-in-chief, to pursue ""personal projects"". The documentary is a mix of both a personal view/impression of Carine Roitfeld, and the efforts to launch a brand new magazine in the span of about 6-7 months. In that regard, this documentary can be described as ""Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel"" meets ""The September Issue"" (although Roitfeld is NOT Diane Vreeland, let's be clear about that).

Couple of comments: writer-director Fabien Constant was given unparalleled access to his subject matter, without any visible restrictions. I don't know whether it was a conscious decision, but the documentary spends just a few fleeting moments on Carine's past, as a result of which we don't get to understand how this woman arrived to this particular moment in her life. Nor are we any the wiser what exactly happened for her to walk away (or to be pushed out?) at Vogue Paris. The movie does a much better job documenting the challenges of launching a new magazine, and in fact the last 30-40 min. are entirely focused on that, and are for me the most compelling part of this documentary. A big negative throughout the documentary for me is the incessant name-dropping. Kanye West! Donatella Versace! Kate Upton! Scarlett Johansson! Stef Van der Laan! and on and on, it just never stops. Carine Roitfeld does give us a couple of great lines, though, such as ""It's better to be told you look beautiful tonight than to be asked what are you wearing"", ha! And even more appropriate: ""You have to love the camera!"", which Carine certainly does.

Imagine my surprise when this documentary showed up out of the blue at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati some months ago last Fall without any pre-release hype or advertising. I figured this wouldn't play very long and went ahead to see it right away. The screening I saw this at was not well attended, and I wasn't surprised. Bottom line: ""Mademoiselle C."" is an okay documentary. But if you are interested in high fashion and/or the fashion magazine world, then this is a no-brainer and a can't-miss.",1389571200,10,2452,4.877697841726619
6166618,5,B00HI9QDJS,"Did Tom Ford produce this movie?  Wow, I had no idea.  It was freakin awesome!  I loved it so much.  Seeing behind the scenes of a photo shoot for a glamour magazine was loads of fun.  Also, this woman has a fabulous personality, warm and down to earth and just really playful and fun and everyone around her seems to love working with her, so refreshing!",1445040000,,355,4.318181818181818

6166622,2,B00HI9QDJS,"if you listen very carefully, you get a sense how carinne comes up w/ the images. however, the film is a failure vs marc jacobs & LVMH DVD which shows the results of Marc J's work over the season vs this one where we see the genesis of magazine but not showing the end results of creating photo spreads is tedious to watch.

other reviewers who state that it is an ad for mag is correct. fail vs anna wintour Sept issue is that VOGUE photos were very beautiful even in unedited state but this DVD never showed the photos[probably good but who knows?]. Fact that she had to take job at Harper's probably means that her mag FAILED ultimately

Wintour Sept DVD was more informative of magazine biz vs CR's.",1423180800,2,703,4.358778625954199

Every few scenes you have to turn down the music because there are almost like Hitchcock-type moments with the music where its just a loud screech. Other parts its just really ominous music, who wants to watch a documentary about fashion to an ominous soundtrack? It should be an escape. Really annoying. Not a great documentary but something just to put in the background if you like fashion and views of some parts of the city of Paris.",1532390400,,482,4.616279069767442

8633017,2,B00HI9QDJS,"Completely missed the mark to document a legendary fashion powerhouse. The film was long, boring, & amateurish. The film tries too hard to be avant guard with odd camera angles and weird music snippets. There was lots of cheek kissing, famous people, glamour, but almost zero insight to the creative process. The film made it appear that famous photographers, super models, and beautiful clothing just appeared in random locations for photo shoots. The only real insight I took away from this documentary was that Karl Lagerfeld can be funny.",1446163200,5,542,5.101123595505618
