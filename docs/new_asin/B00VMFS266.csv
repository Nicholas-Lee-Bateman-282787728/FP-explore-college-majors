8710575,4,B00VMFS266,"If you've only watched Meiko Kaji in Lady Snowblood, you're missing out on someone who was a pop icon in her heyday.

(Yeah, we're all here in 90-some percent of the cases because of Kill Bill, right?  Let's be honest -- Lady Snowblood wasn't even on most of our radar screens until we learned Kill Bill was adapted from that film series!)

In the early 1970s, she starred in a series of juvenile delinquent/""bad girl"" movies from a B-movie production company.  These are the films that really established her as a cinema presence prior to Lady Snowblood In spite of those limitations -- we all know B-movies don't have the largest budgets, there are certain cheesy elements there are present --, these films show a side of Japan Westerners may not be aware of and certainly some things the Japanese don't like to advertise.

Yes, Japan has issues with crime.  There are definitely areas of their cities that are not the greatest areas to live in.  Fact is, the buildings used in these productions were VERY run down!

There's also the matter of racism and the way  people of mixed heritage (especially if they have Japanese blood) are treated in Japanese society.  There is some very frank language and subplots running through at least two of these films about this subject which is perhaps more taboo overseas than even in the West.

The music, as usual for Japanese pop, is two decades behind the US at points (there's a very Andrews Sister pop group in the third Stray Cat film) but at other points you have Japanese pop artists emulating Western music, pumping out ballads that sound vaguely like the folk rock and protest music that was very popular in the States in the late 1960s and early 1970s so it's not completely out of step with the times.

So, yes, what I've described sounds very much like a film you might expect to see from Roger Corman or one of the independent producers in the States at this time (early 1970s) but it's really a time capsule of a moment in Japan which happened to mirror and actually reflect some things that were going in the US as well.  I was very surprised to see this.

After watching the first film in this series, I wondered what I had gotten and whether I had wasted my money.  After I viewed the third film, I was POSITIVE I had lucked onto something special, something different.

These films are very entertaining if you're someone open to an entertainment experience that isn't completely brain-dead like 90%+ of the films made today are.  There are some subtle messages but these films are also brutally frank at points, mildly violent, and definitely do NOT have that implausible ending so many Hollywood films are notorious for!

Meiko Kaji is definitely the linchpin for these films...  She is why you see them as she's the central cast member or a primary cast from the second film onwards in this series.  Technically, another actress was cast as ""the lead"" in the first film but Kaji just stood out to audiences and the production company wisely made her a primary focus from the second film onwards.

There is a definite repertoire company in these films and you will see actors making appearances in multiple films.  Be aware, though, that even though the themes are similar between films the characters don't continue between films and Kaji and company are depicting DIFFERENT characters in the films.  It's a situation akin to the ""Man with No Name"" trilogy of spaghetti westerns Clint Eastwood did in the 1960s -- same actor, different characters for each film but with similar character traits.

On the technical side, there is good and bad news here.  First, the bad --
Japanese studios perhaps take less care of their films than American studios do and these films do show definite signs of wear on the prints.  There are scratches on them and pinholes.  However, they were definitely cared for by Arrow Films and transferred as best as could be for hi-definition release.  Colors are nice and you don't have the compression syndromes and other issues that would be present on a DVD/MPEG-2 release.  Film grain is not bad and considering how well the films WERE cared for they are in decent shape for films getting close to 50 years in vintage!
The audio is solid mono but it's presented (at least from what I've heard) without any distortion and is as good as could be expected.  I've heard a lot worse on anime releases from the 1980s and even the 1990s!  The audio on these films compares favorably with most major US studio releases from the late 1960s onward...

The extras are basically limited to trailers of 3-4 of the films and a booklet that contains a mini-history of the production company behind these films as well as production stills featuring the cast.
To tell you the truth, I HATED the packaging for these films and bought a 5-disc BD case to store all my BD's and DVD's.  That cardboard packaging is just too weak and a corner of my copy of the set was a bit crumpled..  I would have preferred a plastic case or a more durable chipboard than what I got.  I plan on scanning the case art of my copy and printing out a slipcover for the BD case the discs are residing in now...",1503619200,2,5162,4.62280701754386

8710577,5,B00VMFS266,"Stray Cat Rock is a series of exploitation film made by Nikatsu Film productions in the years 1970 and 1971, that were supposed to appeal to young people with a more western sensibility. The Stray Cat Rock series has a level of bizarre Japanese approximations of western culture, with each film being similar crime films. While the film's are all interesting Sex Hunter and Mechanical Animal are the standouts with Wild Jumbo, Delinquent Girl Boss, and Beat '71 all vary from good to ok, none of the films are truly bad. They all look great and Arrows packaging is really something special. The special features are plenty. Overall a really great package for fans of Stray Cat Rock, and fans of Japanese exploitation cinema.",1452384000,3,724,4.846774193548387
8710578,4,B00VMFS266,"This Limited Boxset Collection From Arrow Video is a Nice set to have for collectors.

Stray Cat Rock is a box set of 5 films which all don't run together but features all the same actors and film style. The first 3 films where the best of the bunch with film 4 taking a turn with a lower star rating and the last film bringing the series of films back a little higher in the star rating. All 5 films follow the Hippie, Youth 70s Japanese sploitation line with Acton a very little amount of boobs being shown. Meiko Kaji did a great job but even better her acting in Sex Hunter was great as she was more boss. The Last film I feel she wasn't a lead actor as she wasn't absent in a lot of it as the majority of the film focused on the Hippie group she ran with while she was locked up ans was playing more of a girly girl compared to the other films where she ran the gangs she was involved in and or took more control of things. Sex Hunter was the best of the bunch for me with Delinquent Girl Boss running behind it. Least favorite film was Machine Animal.

Overall I enjoyed the box set and it was nice to see Meiko Kaji back on my TV screen. With that said I give this box set a 4 out of 5

Delinquent Girl Boss  4
Wild Jumbo  4
Sex Hunter  4.5
Machine Animal  3
Beat 71  3.5

The Audio and Video Quality is on Par with other Arrow Films which is a great remaster from original Material",1448841600,,1389,3.9855595667870034
8710579,4,B00VMFS266,"Kaji Cool begins here!  I liked Wild Jumbo the best, for Meiko Kaji was able to show a side of herself I`ve never seen in any of her other films. I especially like when she was driving the jeep out on the shoreline, while her friends were literally mooning onlookers up & down the beach, until they were caught by the cops!!  Lol............  They even had the nerve to get smart with the cops too!!",1445385600,,399,4.293333333333333
8710580,5,B00VMFS266,"Excellent box set. These 5 films gave Meiko Kaji her starpower and helped shape her onscreen persona, taking her from demure schoolgirl (her early work) to, basically, Japan's answer to Pam Grier in the 1970s.

Delinquent Girl Boss, Sex Hunter and Machine Animal were great movies, not a dull moment. Wild Jumbo wasn't too bad either, but Beat '71 was boring as f*** to be honest.

The films have been wonderfully preserved on these discs. According to the booklet, Arrow Video obtained copies of the master prints direct from Nikkatsu for this set, so they appear on your TV screen with the same picture quality as if they were screened in Japan in 1970...that includes all the little imperfections, nothing has been digitally molested here aside from the transfer to disc.

If you are a fan of Meiko Kaji and/or Japanese cult cinema they buy this set before they disappear, the sets are limited to only 3000 copies in the United States and I'm glad I got mine.",1440720000,6,962,4.714285714285714
8710581,2,B00VMFS266,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Perhaps the phrase lost in translation isn't quite as applicable here as I would have hoped. Its not the literal translation of words that made this collection of films unenjoyable for me but the loss of the inspiration to translate into the world of Japan that Im talking about here. While these films were immensely popular in Japan at the time, Im guessing that had they played here in the drive-ins where the original biker films of the same time period played people would have wondered what they were watching.

Inspired by the popularity of films like Roger Cormans THE WILD ANGELS, Japanese studios began to make their own version of biker films around the same time. The difference is that the gangs represented here in these films felt more like teen gangs being portrayed by adult actors. Let me change that. These gangs felt more like pre-teens even. Their antics were lame compared to the depravity and violence found in biker films made here in the U.S. If you can accept the difference between the two then perhaps these movies might be up your alley. For me I found them lacking in everything possible.

While I may not have enjoyed these films there are two things I will say about them. The first is that yes, there probably are people out there who will be so immersed in the culture that they fall in love with these films. Those people will love that this set is now available. Secondly I realize that there is a need for movies like this to be released in DVD or blu-ray format. Historically speaking any and all films deserve to be placed in safe keeping so they don't disappear like a number of films that are already lost to the world.

With that out of the way, here are the films with a short synopsis of each so you know what is included in this set.

DELINQUENT GIRL BOSS  A group of girl bikers takes on the Yakuza after they rig boxing matches that involve a friend of theirs. When the leader of the bikers is taken out, revenge is sought by the rest of the girls.

WILD JUMBO  This time a gang of five friends known as the Pelican Gang does little more than drive around in their dune buggies listening to psychedelic music. Eventually they plan a heist of 30 million yen from a religious movement.

SEX HUNTER  This time around a girl gang takes on a racist male gang. Both seem to find time to do little more than fight and listen to rock n roll. The racist gang takes particular disliking to what they term half breeds and after hurting a friend of the girl gang a major battle is on the way.

MACHINE ANIMAL  This time a girl gang called the Alleycats are on friendly terms with another gang called Dragon, the main supplier of drugs in their town. When the Alleycats attempt to help three guys including an American soldier on the run, Dragon isn't pleased with their efforts and an eventual showdown is bound to happen.

BEAT 71  This time around the Alleycats have become hippies and live in a commune. When the main girls boyfriend, the son of a Yakuza boss, fails to meet his fathers expectations his father kidnaps him to set him straight.

While these descriptions of the movies included might sound simple the fact is that the movie themselves feel just as simple. More time is spent driving around, dancing to music, laying around wasted or just fighting at the drop of a hat to fill the time of each movie. And while they are termed violent movies while watching I felt like there was more violence on TV at the time than I found in any of these movies.

For the most part I found myself bored while watching. I kept waiting for something to happen. I wanted to love these movies having heard they were such a part of the culture at the time and yet I could never quite get into any of them. But thats me. As Ive said all along I have little doubt that there are some out there who will love these movies and cherish them. Im happy for you. But Im not part of that crowd.

Arrow Video has done a great deal by releasing these five films as a set for fans to enjoy. The set includes all five movies in the series as well as interviews with star Tatsuya Fuji who was in all 5 films, an interview with Yoshio Harada who was in BEAT 71, trailers and an interview with the director of three of the films, Yasuharu Hasebe. As Ive discovered with all Arrow Video releases they are made by fans for fans and should please anyone seeking these films.",1440547200,3,4443,4.398780487804878
8710582,5,B00VMFS266,"Nikkatsu was the hippest studio around in 1970. The had the hottest stars, the hottest musicians, the hottest women, and the movies featured all the latest fashions. These movies were completely western in their approach; there was nothing traditionally Japanese about them. And yet, this makes them even MORE Japanese in a strange way. For instance, in the third film MACHINE ANIMAL, the delinquents and hippies ""drop acid"" and then proceed to stumble around as if they'd had one Sapporo too many. Apparently no one in the cast had ever dropped acid. And therein lies some of this series' charm.

Of the five films, WILD JUMBO is my favorite. It's the most freewheeling, uneven, silly, improvisational and ultimately shocking movie of the group. Also, Meiko Kaji shows a side of herself in this film that you never see. Since Bunjaku Han has the ""femme fatale"" role in this film, Kaji gets to play a more relaxed, less glamorous and ultimately more interesting character. Also Tatsuya Fuji is excellent in all the films but particularly shines in this one.

Everyone thinks SEX HUNTER is the best. Maybe because it's the film that first established Meiko's ""Kaji Cool"" which she would later hone in her later films. Or maybe it's because it deals with race relations and ""half bloods"". But I find it problematic. The half Japanese/half Italian actor that plays one of the main roles is just plain BAD. I can't sympathize with him. And you must if the film is going to work. This movie overreaches within the form it's in. These breezy entertainments are best when they don't try too hard and Sex Hunter tries WAY TOO HARD. The featured music group is the girl group The Golden Half and they're kinda fantastic.

I had seen most of these films before in bootleg form so it was fun to watch them again. The Blu rays look great (I haven't watched the DVDs yet and probably never will - why do they do this? Why don't they just go all out and release a blu ray/dvd/vhs/betamax/laserdisc/and view master box set?).  I wish it had just been released on two blu ray discs like that simple Lone Wolf & Cub set from years ago. Minor quibbles aside, it's worth a purchase for Meiko Kaji and Tatsuya Fuji alone. And for being simply a great time capsule of early 70's Shinjuku.",1439078400,3,2267,4.674185463659148
8710583,4,B00VMFS266,"Since it's inception Arrow USA had quite a few interesting releases, but none of them were a total package homerun for the price in my book.

Stray Cat Rock, however, delivers the goods.  5 films are included, all of the Japanese biker gang variety; I paid $44, making the entry price less than $10/film. If you ever saw Synapse's Pinky Violence Collection and liked it, you probably would also enjoy this set as well.  If you have never seen movies of this nature, it is probably worth looking up a few trailers on YouTube, as you will know very quickly whether it interests you or not.

In terms of the package, you get a 5-disc set (2 Blu-rays with 5 films, 3 DVD with the same 5 films).  You get a ~25 page booklet with full color photos and text.  A number of extras are included, however I did not check these out.  Picture quality is good with preservation of grain structure and color without compression artifacts.  Presentation is Japanese with subtitles.

Overall I really like Arrow's effort here and felt the pricing was fair.  I knocked off one star, however, as the packaging is a bit nightmarish.  First, the outer cover and cardboard that holds the disc trays together is very thin and does not look like it will hold up over time.  Second, the trays themselves instead of using a standard hub have clips on the sides and the discs slide in.  Take one disc out and it is very easy for the one behind it to fall out or get jostled and scratched; further, taking out a disc is not as easy as a traditional hub design.  Overall, a bit too much form over function and I would have preferred a 5-disc Elite case with a nice slipcover instead of a custom case that is difficult to use and could potentially get damaged or even damage the discs over time.

On the whole though, this is Arrow's best value offered in the USA to date and worth the asking price.  Recommended.",1436832000,13,1883,4.430232558139535
8710584,3,B00VMFS266,"Stray Cat Rock: The Collection contains five Japanese biker films. The first, Stray Cat Rock: Delinquent Girl Boss, was originally a response by Nikkatsu Studios to rival Toei Studios Delinquent Boss series. Because of its popularity, four additional films in the series were made. Delinquent Girl Boss takes place in Tokyo where rival youth gangs are always trying to outdo each other in toughness. An all-girl gang led by Mei gets involved with dangerous types when her boyfriend Michio wants to join a powerful yakuza organization but inadvertently loses the gangsters money in a fixed boxing match. Mei and gang jump to the rescue as they take on the gangsters. The plot covers only two days and involves endless fights, chase scenes, and tough talk. It contains an underlying feminist theme along with pretty dark subject matter.

The other films in the series are basically stand-alone efforts. The second film, Wild Jumbo, is very different in tone with lots of humor and zany goings-on. Some of its scenes are reminiscent of classic silent comedy.  The third installment, Sex Hunter, is best known here in America because its been available on DVD. It contains bizarre costume design, violence, and sex. Its soundtrack contains jazz-infused rock and group sounds, particularly Golden Haif, a mixed-race girl group popular in Japan at the time. The other films in the collection are Machine Animal and Beat 71. Because the films have a short running time, they end well before their welcome is worn out and are entertaining for their over-the-top action. Performances are far from Academy Award-caliber, but thats part of the fun. The movies, made in 1970 and 1971, have a washed-out look that resembles Hollywood exploitation pictures of the era. All films are in Japanese, with English subtitles.

Special features on the five-disc Blu-ray set include new English subtitles for all five films; interview with Yasuharu Hasebe, director of Delinquent Girl Boss, Sex Hunter, and Machine Animal; interview with Tatsuya Fuji, star of all five films; original trailers, and collectors booklet.",1436659200,9,2096,5.195266272189349
