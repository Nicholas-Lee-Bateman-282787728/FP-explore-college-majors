8525101,5,B0084FQZ66,"On the 3rd day of Christmas 2015 I'm going to review...ROH Death Before Dishonor 6. The Briscoe Brothers-Jigsaw & Ruckus-tag team match was short but still a fun opener. The Chris Hero-Delirious match was a pretty good bout. The Roderick Strong-Eddie Edwards match was okay even the TNA-style interference. The NWA Worlds title match between Adam Pearce-Brent Albright was hard-hitting,smash-mouth,awesome hybrid of old-school 1980's build & new millennium moves. The Austin Aries-Jimmy Jacobs-The Necro Butcher-3 way bout wasn't much more than angle advancement, but it worked for what it was. The Go Shiozaki-Naomichi Marufuji match was great and everything was hit spot on and with little hesitation to boot. The Kevin Steen & El Generico-The Motor City Machine Guns-tag team match was a high-flying,tough,stiff funfest. The ROH World Title, Four-Way Elimination: Nigel McGuinness vs. Bryan Danielson vs. Claudio Castagnoli vs. Tyler Black was  really just a Nigel vs. Tyler contest, and a good one at that but the others were great too. I give this event a 9 out of 10.",1450224000,,1073,5.2748538011695905
