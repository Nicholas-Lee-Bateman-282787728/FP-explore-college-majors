I am using this daily in a portable DVD player from my bed before I get out of bed!  Wonderful crystal bowl music to take you you into a deep and peaceful place and enchanting movement of BArbaras beautiful images to bring you focus.  A lovely way to meditate, relax, and start or end your day.  Just beautiful!  Three meditations on one DVD.",1379548800,,557,6.373333333333333
