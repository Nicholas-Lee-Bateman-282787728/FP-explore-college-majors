8194628,5,B000Q6GUX4,"(By consumer, (Joseph Lupoli) I read somewhere that this is a very good film. Unfortunately, I didn't thoroughly read the fine print. Nowhere does the seller state that this movie is subtitled in English, or in any other language, for that matter. They were right. It's in Spanish only, (a language I don't speak). That's my fault, so of course I'm not gonna punish the seller with a poor rating because of my own oversight. I'm giving this movie 5 stars in good good faith, even though I tossed the film in the trash. No biggie. I'll just re-buy a subtitled version somewhere.",1514332800,,577,4.611650485436893
