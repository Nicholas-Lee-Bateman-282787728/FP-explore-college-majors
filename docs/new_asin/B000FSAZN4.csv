8126110,4,B000FSAZN4,"I really enjoyed this lighthearted, offbeat movie starring Marlon Brando and Ewa Aulin - along with an all-star cast. This film was directed by Marlon's friend, Christian Marquand, the man after whom Marlon reportedly named his first son, Christian Brando. Ewa Aulin plays her part as a naive young woman searching for her personal ""truth"" in life. Marlon Brando, donning a black wig and heavy make-up, plays a guru who ""helps"" the character played by Aulin to dispose of her ""material corruptions,"" namely her clothes. He is ""helping"" her to find ""that place which we call the center of all breath."" She asks, ""My lungs?"" And, he answers that it is ""more complicated than that."" He then searches over her body for her ""center of all breath"" and locates it in a surprising, or maybe not so surprising, place on her body.

This is just one part of the film during which I found myself laughing out loud. Marlon played his role with great humor and lightheartedness. He did not take himself too seriously in this role and it made for terrific entertainment. I do not think there is another actor that could have pulled this role off as beautifully as Marlon did. I truly enjoyed this film.",1193702400,4,1187,4.706730769230769
8126111,3,B000FSAZN4,"This movie along with others of its age depicts and documents a bizarre state that the western world enjoyed for a very brief few years.  For a high budget movie there is nothing particularly exciting about the story, the directing, or even the acting.  The movie's main value at this point in time is as a depiction of a point of great change in the western world.  Social anthropologists will value this movie in their collections.

It took me close to 24 hours to convert the PAL dvd to NTSC -- too bad that I couldn't find a decently priced NTSC version to begin with.",1192233600,2,572,4.419047619047619
8126112,5,B000FSAZN4,"I don't know why this film wasn't a hit. It has one of the most starfull cast of ever: Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, James Coburn and Ringo Starr among others! And it crazy as it can be. Don't miss it!",1191283200,,218,4.214285714285714
