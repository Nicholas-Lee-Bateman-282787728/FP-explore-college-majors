I paid the extra for the Bluray and the documentary film that is included.  Worth it I guess, though pretty darn expensive at $160.",1478736000,,283,4.73469387755102

I can't add any more superlatives about the music than the other reviewers have already, except that the book-type package again puts the GRATEFUL DEAD ahead of the pack.  The limited edition deluxe version comes in a STURDY slipcase with another beautiful tie-die pattern, and a has a great 40 page booklet with essays about the history of this long cherished show and what it took to do it right for release.  The band held back releasing the concert until they could strike a deal with the film's producer, and while everyone's grumbled for years about it's unavailability, it was well worth the wait.  The limited deluxe edition's DVD or Blu-Ray contains the 40 minute documentary shown prior to the film at the debut screenings all around the country on August 1, 2013. It's great to see all the living participants compared to their youthful selves, man, are we getting old or what? If you have the $$$ the Blu-Ray is the way to go, the 1080p picture and loss-less audio are stunning! Now what we need next is the Belgian TV concert and hour long Bremen Beat Club performance (both exist) from the '72 tour on DVD and Blu-Ray.  What about it boys??????

I just want to add for the customer thinking of purchasing this that the whole concert is NOT on the DVD.  The movie would have had to be over three hours long! The film is a documentary about the concert, and all the DEAD's performances are uncut (including the transcendent 30 min. ""Dark Star"" journey).  The picture and sound are terrific considering their age, but has there ever been an official GRATEFUL DEAD release that hasn't been top notch?  I just don't want to see poor reviews saying ""...but the whole concert wasn't on the DVD, bummer...""  Here's a list of the UNCUT performances:

8616092,5,B00FJN54M2,"This Concert is really Gorgeous. I've seen many bootlegs of this Show around the Net... and this Newly Remastered version is thoroughly Amazing in comparison.

This Concert was filmed in 16mm and even so, the VIDEO is Fantastic! The Colors are Bright & Natural and Saturated without being even remotely Over-Saturated or Unrealistic-Looking. Even the Sunburn on the folks setting-up the Stage is 100% Natural-Looking.

The SOUND (on the other hand) Is also Pretty Amazing! The CDs sound Great but the Audio on the Blu-Ray IS ASTOUNDING!!! The Separation is fantastic and the Instruments and Vocals all have their own perfect Places in the Image Mix. (I was hypnotized by Phil's amazing Bass Playing AND the incredible Sound of his Alembic Bass). This is definitely one of the Very Best Audio Mixes from a Live Concert, that I've ever heard!

Keep in mind that this is still available in every format, except Vinyl, at the Deadstore.  So don't be fleeced by the soulless After-Market profiteers.  Their lowest price as of this minute, is $160. This version with the CD Set, Blu-Ray and Book are still priced at $54.98.

8616095,5,B00FJN54M2,"This is a classic Dead show for sure.  Historical footage of 1972, life was simpler in those days.  Strong music from the Dead, amazing China Ryder and Dark Star.  The movie is really great, the people walking around naked really did not care at all.  That would get you arrested these days and turn you into a Youtube hit.  The crowd was really having an amazing time despite the heat.  The sound is great and the movie is a great snapshot of 1972 history.  Some great songs are slightly spoiled by Donna's ridicules cat yelling.  Sure bet for any Deadhead.  Then again if you are a Deadhead, you already know.",1382918400,4,611,4.4818181818181815
