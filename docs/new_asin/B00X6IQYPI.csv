7159445,3,B00X6IQYPI,It's a cute low budget rom-con that is a little overacted. It's enjoyable if you take it for what it is.,1433635200,,104,4.0

7159450,5,B00X6IQYPI,"hot, and fun, and perfect romantic comedy. two best friends signing a contract they will marry each other if they will not find the Mr Right in 10 years. only that one is all for it, the other is a confirmed bachelor... can you guess who will change idea after 10 years? of course you can :-) good actors and even more good production, Jc Calciano is getting better movie after movie and if I wasn't already a fan, I would be for sure now!",1433376000,26,439,4.176470588235294
7159451,4,B00X6IQYPI,"Decent plot, some contrivances due to the medium, and a few poor casting choices (Stone/Hunter/whoever the random guy was needed to be recast). I give it 4 stars for the indie movie that is not quite up o hollywood level storytelling, but it has a few areas that did shine.

I would say to other viewers don't expect Hollywood quality and enjoy the plot versus the limitations on scenery, actors, and action.

As a love story, a certain type of gay man can relate to this plot, because a lot of us have been there going through the motions of looking for a perfect partner, only to end up with nothing but sour memories. Sometimes, it is a matter of overcompensation (the funniest scene is the fast dates that happened in the middle of the movie, where the guy went obsessive over details from facebook stalking :P ). He's not a bad guy for going too such extremes, but just like many of us, trying to figure out what is the right way to be a good boyfriend.

On the other end, you have the man's man; a gay cop with a libido that could probably make him a fortune in a certain industry :P I have heard about guys like that, but never really met one. The character is more or less a walking contradiction; he can be caring and honorable, but he is a total slave to sex drive.

Here's the contrivance, the characters are the old perfectly odd couple that should be together motif, done with gay sensibilities. There is nothing wrong with opposites attract, but it leads to some predictable issues and plot points.",1433203200,11,1512,4.428057553956834
7159452,5,B00X6IQYPI,"This was a great watch.  The plot is really sweet, no one ever writes romantic comedies for gay men (or women for that matter), and I personally think the production quality is fabulous.  The acting was on point and I really enjoyed it!",1431907200,,236,4.465116279069767

Myles crushes each relationship that he is in by being.....too much. Very clingy, very needy and rushes things so much. Both Myles and Brody are amazingly gorgeous and very attractive. The 10 year plan is made when both are 25 years old and as always Brody has to come to Myles comfort when Myles loses yet another boyfriend. The pact is if both are single in 10 years they will become a couple ad time is ticking and Brody is panicking. The story is nothing new but nonetheless very cute love the friends very much, Diane and Officer Garcia. Needless to say you will need to suspend some beliefs and wonderment....why did it take 10 years to......well, you will see. The acting was much better than many indie films and this is an incredibly sweet movie. Totally recommend.",1502236800,,939,4.529411764705882

7159462,4,B00X6IQYPI,"I really enjoyed the characters this film presented! The end was a little tongue-in-cheek about the traditional rom-com tropes, but it was cute. It was refreshing to see a movie so open about sexuality and pleasure. I do wish the plot had gone a touch deeper, and maybe that it had wrapped up the ending a little better. It just felt a little thrown to the wind.
All in all, a feel-good gay rom-com!",1496534400,,399,4.405405405405405

I would recommend this movie for a night at home with your loved one or with close friends that need to get away from a crazy world and see a movie to relax and make you laugh. I can watch this movie over and over again since the characters are relatable and they are smoking hot especially Jack Turner (Myles) and his best friend is just as hot Michael Adam Hamilton (Brody).",1486166400,,450,4.305882352941176

7159482,4,B00X6IQYPI,"My spouse and I were on our usually frustrating hunt for something worthwhile to watch. As we scanned over film after film, The 10 Year Plan went by. The cover caught our eye first. I mean really, who could resist Jack Turner holding a rose while doing puppy dog eyes? As we watched a nerdy Myles turn into hot lawyer Myles we hoped that he would wise up about giving away too much too soon. A smart guy would have figured this out before ten years went by, right? Nonetheless, we chose to buy into it because we are suckers for a good romance. It''s really no different than watching an action movie, just a temporary suspension of reality for the chance to be transported elsewhere. We knew where we hoped it would end up but we were not really convinced it would happen until the last few lines. It reminded us of another favorite, The Big Eden. This will definitely go onto our list of go to movies.",1482537600,,903,4.349112426035503

7159497,2,B00X6IQYPI,"I think nearly all gay movies are are just cliched rehashing of equally campy predecessors at this point, with mediocre acting from actors who had more of a porn-star vibe than Hollywood.  Of all the acting in the movie, the only genuinely believable and natural theatrics came from the lone female in the cast.  If you've ever watched even a single gay movie before, you knew what to expect from the entire film after the first 5-10 minutes.  It was predictable from start to finish.  One gets the feeling that campy old queens with money in LA all want to produce a movie, and they all want to produce the exact same one, and so they do: year in and year out.

That said, everyone is hot, the scripting is decent, and as always, it lands on a happy ending.  So, it is what it is.",1480377600,,781,4.315068493150685

I fell in love with the way the story unfolded and paced between the two main characters (and also supporting cast) - two guys who spontaneously enact a pact to become a couple in 10 years if they were still single.

I feel not I may not be able to capture a movie's essence simply by the words that I use, but, I must say that this move was unimaginably enjoyable. This movie is adorable. This movie is unique. This movie is definitely a movie I would recommend and own because of the twist(s) that was portrayed throughout the movie in recognition of the conclusion. I truly laughed at many different points. I enjoyed where humour was inserted into the movie as it truly helped with the high intense emotions. One perk I will express about this movie is that this movie is not overtly and sickly dramatic. This movie has enjoyable, realistic and relate able characters and I enjoyed many of them. I am truly happy I picked this film out of my Amazon Prime list, even then, I would recommend someone to rent the movie. If you want something with your dinner or for your evening snack that is lighthearted, more human based and realistic to how situation(s) might actually play out in real life, and a little more fine tuned toward what the idea(s) of love really mean... then I recommend this movie.

It's a simple play on two character types - the dedicated romantic (only a fully committed, loving relationship will do) versus Mr. ""One Night Stand"" only / King of the Hook-ups. The scenes of the ""over-the-top"" romantic being, well, over the top in his pursuit of love are sometimes a bit silly but none the less are enjoyable and somewhat endearing.  Their friendship seems to stand the test of time, and I personally enjoyed the long-suffering, unrequited nice guy crush on his caring but clueless player best bro.  It was a pat but sweet wrap up, making for a nice, entertaining diversion.",1472774400,,755,4.837209302325581

7159565,5,B00X6IQYPI,"Now this is definitely the best gay themed/love movie that I have watched since Shelter way back in 2007.
The story is believable, realistic & heart-warming  easily re-seen several times for the feel good factor.
There was no boring or go slow moments in the movie  a testament to the skill & ability of the Director/Writter JC Calciano.
The lead actors Michael Hamilton & Jack Turner are way too hot & smoulder on the screen & their chemistry brings great credit to JC Calciano for paring them.
A Public GO FUND offer of a dinner date with either of these actors would bring in BIG bucks.
The main support actors of Moronai Kanekoa, Adam Bucci & Teri Reeves certainly added to the depth & memorability of this wonderful movie.
The other BONUS FEATURE you shouldnt miss, is in the Special Features interviews with the main actors & Director = very informative & insightful - just adding to the quality of all involved in  the production of this first class movie.
I would hope for all our sake, that a sequel is in the pipe line & if we are really lucky a little more incidental/natural nudity from at least the 2 main actors = some would say the more the merrier!
A seductive/tasteful love screen always sticks in one mind when they recall a movie to a friend.

Otherwise, he was almost as bad acting as the other guy, the so called stud. Most of his lines were delivered through ear-to-ear sh**-eating grin. Didn't make much a character. And yet, they were both physically pretty/handsome/good looking so probably how and why they got the job.  Another typical move of movie companies or producers making main characters very good looking. Never average or other type.  The script was pretty bad, too. O crap.

I do, however, agree with one of the previous reviewers who said that the Hunter/Stone character seemed to be miscast; he struck me as ""dark"" and out-of-place...seemingly not the type who would appeal to either Myles or Brody.

7159634,4,B00X6IQYPI,"I expected kinda bad acting, and to a degree I did get that; there were some corny lines and more than a couple of occasions where you're thinking, ""Who talks like that?"" And with some scenes I could look at their faces and see that they had too much makeup on. But I really found the whole thing funny and sweet. I even (almost) cried a couple of times.

Myles was handsome, adorable, sweet, and successful, but he took clingy to a whole other level. He was actually borderline stalkish. If he & Brody didn't already know everything about each other, Myles' stalking probably would've run him off, too. Brody was a good guy, he just wanted to sleep with everything that wasn't nailed or tied down. But he was the only one who seemed to appreciate all of Myles' quirks and laugh at all of his jokes. And with the almost abnormal closeness they shared (calling before, during & after dates and sometimes during sex) they might as well have been together. Diane was a bit abrasive and I didn't like her at first, but she turned out to be a good friend for Myles. Brody's partner, Richard (who looks like a tanned Matt Dillon IMO) was a good guy, but him making so many appearances in a gay bar seemed a bit...strange. I didn't think they made a good couple but whatever. Hunter/Stone/whoever was a real creepo. The secret star was the old guy who lived next door to Myles. This was a really cute movie. The only thing I would've changed is maybe an ""epilogue"" fast forwarding to Brody & Myles still happy and together in a few years. And Hunter getting played like a fiddle.",1445644800,6,1572,4.439446366782007

His best friend, a (sexy) cop, probably the epitome of the modern Grindr(er), is the total opposite. But opposites attract...or do they?

Granted they're both white gay males it's nice to see gay characters as more than just props. There are some stereotypes but I felt they were well rounded characters and I felt happy/sad/mad for them. I really enjoyed this movie it's a cheesy love story that makes you smile and makes you upset its a nice alternative to the basic white straight couple love story.

My friends and I were debating over what Amazon Prime film to watch, when we stumbled upon this delightful surprise.  We have no idea why the negative comments ... seriously, compared to so many other LGBT films that have been released, this was absolutely delightful.

Fun from the start, great writing with believable acting by very attractive actors & actresses, and made us emotionally move easily from chuckling to even getting a bit teary-eyed during several scenes.  It was definitely worth watching.  The cinematography and sound quality were also surprisingly well done.  Good job all around.

Is it a blockbuster Hollywood extravaganza?  No.  And why should it be?  It's an indie film that is surprisingly well done from start to finish.  It's refreshing to see a film that doesn't have only a justified 2 star rating in our LGBT genre.  Thank you to the producer & director.

7159707,5,B00X6IQYPI,"Just finished watching ""The 10 Year Plan"" released by Cinema175.
JC Calaciano's third romantic comedy on the heels of ""Is It Just Me?' and ""e-Cupid"" is a charming story of Myles and Brody - two best friends with equally opposite ideas of romance and bedroom romps.
Brody, who is a policeman, is a Grindr, bed-hopping guy who likes the ease of sexual adventure without commitment; while Myles is a combination of Mister Romance, with a dash of Martha Stewart mixed in that does come across as creepy to all his first dates and potential husbands.  [Myles is a lawyer.]
So to cheer Myles up on his 25th birthday, after getting dumped again on a first date who excuses himself to go to the restroom, only to head out the door when he thinks Myles isn't looking - Brody arrives and, after mentally ravishing the waiter and making a date with him after his shift at restaurant to do to him what he's thinking, makes Myles draw up a legal document that says that if they're still single when Myles turns 35, Brody will marry him.
Flash forward to the present.  Guess who's still single?!  Myles is ready to adopt a cute dog and just be single.  But under the encourage of Brody, he signs up on Grindr and gets a first ""date"" with Hunter; and here where things get to be interesting.
Brody doesn't like it that Myles has become - gasp - a mirror image.  So to blow off some steam, Brody hooks up with Stone on Grindr only to discover that Hunter and Stone are one and the same.  Brody doesn't sleep stone and tells him off on the way out the door.
Only Brody fesses up and tells Myles what happened with Stone/Hunter; causing Myles to make a drastic decision to break the cycle of bad relationships he's in.  Now it's up to Brody to make Myles see that his ""Mister Right"" is actually the guy who used to be Mister Right Now - Brody.
""The 10 Year Plan"" is a great comedic movie about finding what want and need that has bee exactly under you nose all this time.

Now the plot seriously makes no sense. To gay friends, smart, educated, buffed and nearly intimate for over ten years. And t took them over ten years to figure out they actually love and need each other? Really?

It makes no difference. It's just a hook to hang the interaction between these two characters. Everything else, including the other characters is just fluff.

Jack Turn owns this picture. And he's a fairly new actor at that. Michael Adam Hamilton as his pal Brody is a nice add on and makes this all possible. But it's Turner who shines.

Love is love and this movie was a perfect example of why we should be telling love stories no matter if the couples are gay, straight, bi etc.
Both Michael and Jack play Myles and Brody with such heart and openness that I rooted for them instantly and loved them both as a pair with their unwavering support and sexual tension fizzing under the surface. That ""stripper"" scene has to be one of the shortest but overwhelmingly sexy things I've seen for a LONG time coupled with the heart aching sweetness of Myles and his hapless romantic ways (my only criticism is that sometimes Myles came across as a little TOO naive especially in his ""research"" on other guys - sweetheart, you're verging on stalker at times) and Brody's genuine affection for his friend and gradual realisation of his love.
I am so happy that this movie was made. It's beautifully acted (that ""leaving party"" scene made me tear up), casted perfectly (with the wonderful addition of Teri and Moronai who play a great side pairing and really nail the comedic scenes) and is such a joy to watch.

And in the world of gay cinema, that is something to celebrate.  I do applaud that this movie is not a coming out story or one dealing with gay oppression.  And the movie addresses a serious enough topic  sex vs. commitment in the gay community.  But its approach is so superficial that is hardly adds to the conversation.  (For a great movie on the topic, seek out the British film Weekend, one of the best gay movies ever.)  And, yes, its supposed to be a romantic comedy, so maybe not fair to call it superficial.  But then it is not all that funny or even very romantic.  The biggest problem is the main character of Myles who is simply too good looking, buff and successful to be taken as the loser in love he is supposed to be.  And the fact that in ten years he never changes his losing ways with men is simply not believable.  Nonetheless, I watched all 90 or so minutes  but I probably should have been taking in Weekend for a 4th time.",1439078400,14,1066,4.217821782178218

7159788,3,B00X6IQYPI,"This was a good movie!  That is not to say that it isn't predictable and we haven't seen this ""ugly duckling"" type story too many times already.  But I would take that narrative any day over a gay ""coming of age"" story where the plot involves discovering gayness or having to address it as the primary conflict.  It's a half version of ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" movie trope mixed in with the odd couple that should be lovers, where two single best friends make a pact to be together if by 10 years they've found no one satisfactory mate.

The lead actor Jack Tuner (whom you may recognize his abs/body/person from his guest role on ""Stichers"") plays ""Myles"" is a hopeless romantic who gets attached to his romatic interests too early on in relationships.  He cooks, cleans, works, and caters to the every whim of whomever he is seeing.  This ends up turning off every single one of his love interests, none of which last over a month due to his clinginess.

The problem here is that it isn't believable.  At all.  The acting and talent of the actor is not in question, however.  But you have a flawless looking male who has a toned up tight body (you do get to see him shirtless once or twice - should have been more in my opinion) and you expect audiences to disconnect reality enough to believe that he can't land a husband in a 10 year window?  It's more likely that he would have been on his second divorce by 10 years.  It's just like, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Most people would love to have a man like that with a great high paying job, who cooks, cleans, and spoils his man to the Nth degree.  Someone as hot as that whom could have a new man each week or keep men in a juggling cycle would have been able to find a long term relationship (or 5) within that 10 year window.  Myles may be ""needy"" but I think it's safe to say that most men would overlook that for the catch they would be getting in turn. There is a dating montage scene in this movie where all of Myles' dates are grossed out by his research of the man before the date - really, it isn't that creepy for someone to research someone on (the very PUBLIC) Facebook or social media before or after a date.  ...Sorry JC Calciendo, this was just too unbelievable, Myles isn't a creeper.

The supporting actor that plays the best friend Brody, is also a hot man, and physically has a big mouth as a facial feature.  He would have been more convincing as the lead role's personality rather than the womanizer (manizer?) and the lead role actor would have been more convincing physically as the role of Brody.  The actors should have flip flopped on the roles and it would have been more convincing, ...but honorable to mention that it would be hardly so since they both have great bodies.  (Jack Tuner is more toned and solid though).  There is an adonis factor working here in full swing.

In the movie, the conflict that creates the spat between Myles and Brody that puts a strain on their friendship, nearly ending it, is just plain dumb and reflects such a weak friendship.  It is lazy script writing and insults the audience.  Once they are reconciled, there is misssed opportunity here to show that Myles was in the wrong for getting so upset at Brody for being Brody.  Brody didn't do anything wrong, and immediately corrected when he caught the offending issue.

There was no chemistry between the other supporting ""co-worker"" actors, and their roles were underacted. While it has an outstanding foundation, I feel like this movie could have been so much better.  And don't get me wrong, it was good.  It's a solid entry into the gay rom com genre and the filmic quality and techniques are good.  This is not JC Calciendo's first rodeo into film, and while his previous movie ""eCupid"" wasn't a masterpiece either, I feel he should be stepping it up a notch from his earlier works regarding the writing and casting most of all. There is a certain element of ""cuteness"" to his movies, but they are a little out in left field on realism, perhaps maybe meant to be this way.  He does know what the gay male audience wants to see though, much eye candy.  B-/C+",1438646400,,4125,4.445478723404255

I thought that the guy the lawyer was seeing could have played a more major role maybe (the third guy on the movie cover). However, I liked the bff's of the cop (the macho cop who is down with going to gay bars) and of the lawyer (the woman who should get the hag of the year award). Very strong supporting characters. My favorite aspect of the film is that they show one of the gay characters breaking away from the stereotypical image of the neverending promiscuous lifestyle that the modern gay man is known for and that all sexual orientations are longing for love. Great romantic comedy!",1435276800,,969,4.568965517241379

7159842,2,B00X6IQYPI,"Typically not a movie anyone can relate to.  How can you be close friends with someone and never realize until years later there is a mutual attraction that goes beyond friendship. The main character is good looking, gainfully employed, is mentally and emotionally stable yet he is rejected by a handful of dates to the point they walk out him halfway through their date. I mean who would actually do this?  He states that looks don't matter, however he rejects one man at first sight as ""too ugly"".  After being so picky about his dates he ends up falling for the guy whose lifestyle he totally rejects. Lots of nice eye candy but that's where it ends.",1435017600,5,653,4.564102564102564
7159843,3,B00X6IQYPI,"Some good writing and some good acting here. The core theme of the story, i.e., sometimes love is right in front of you, is a bit hackneyed as well as the device used to propel this theme--the pact--been there, done that. So, given that the core theme lacks originality and the writing is only meh, I think it is worth a bag of popcorn and viewing with a BFF, cause you will both appreciate the eye candy, sorta.",1434931200,10,412,4.294871794871795

This movie entertains on a refreshingly funny yet poignant manner. The acting is pretty good, and though you can tell from camera angles, lighting, and sound that this isn't a big production, it makes up for that in the story line, the feeling of genuine empathy with the characters, and the overall message. Which for me was, there is nothing better than real friendship.",1434672000,,543,4.608247422680412

7159853,3,B00X6IQYPI,"Wow. I stopped counting the cheesy cliches after about 500! The story has promise and it's a shame the director chose to 'gurlfriend' it up instead of developing the characters and not indulging in countless one-liners. Still, it's not the worst movie I've seen and if it's raining outside or you have to fold laundry etc. it's worth a passing glance. Both lead actors are yummy handsome. :)",1434412800,,391,4.764705882352941

7159868,2,B00X6IQYPI,"I'm sorry but I have to agree with the bad reviews here.  Very cheesy, with wooden performances and no real chemistry between the two leads. The plot?  Best friends make a pact to be together in a decade if neither finds love. With two months left in their deadline, they both scramble to find someone to avoid being each other's last resort. But guess what happens?  The problem with the film is that it's never really interesting, amusing or sexy.

Scenes are totally unbelievable with superficial characters who are not really interesting and the entire film just seems insincere.  I will admit that I found the character of Myles (Jack Turner) to be quite the catch despite his endearing flaws. Hey,  he can love, cook and knows how to be romantic: )",1433894400,8,754,4.674242424242424

8715180,4,B00X6IQYPI,"I'm never quite sure how well these films are going to go. Usually the acting or writingthough passableisn't of the caliber you might expect from a professionally produced movie.

However.

I took a chance on this one and loved it. Fully expecting a movie with the look and feel of an after-school special, I've never been more pleased to be dead wrong. I enjoyed this film thoroughly and plan to watch it again. Many gay guys, including me, can identify with Myles and his self-defeating, ceaseless quest for love from the mythical perfect man. But we get to watch the pain (largely self-inflicted) that he experiences, and we can empathize. Of course, the characters are sometimes drawn as little more than caricatures of themselves, but even so, we can relate.

Inevitably, the story is predictable and at times cloying. But if watching it gives even one person hope, or reduces cynicism about gay life by even the merest fraction, it's worth watching.",1514592000,2,955,4.882716049382716

Go ahead... you'll like it!",1511308800,,321,5.28
