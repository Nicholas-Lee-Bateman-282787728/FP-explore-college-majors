738792,5,6303935125,"Diabolique, 1955 film

It is the rare a foreign film with subtitles to be popular in America. This is one of them. The film begins at the gated ""Delasalle School"", a boarding school for boys. A small van unloads food. Mid-term vacation is near. One teacher has a problem in her personal relationship. There is a strange threesome. The owner is a strict disciplinarian. [A psychological failing?] The two women discuss a plot. What kind of meals are served? Is the meal revolting? What about their marriage? The van travels through small towns. The wife Christine asks for a divorce, the husband wants to talk it over. Mlle Honor knows how to drink Scotch whiskey. She also plans to take care of the school Principal Michel.

The story is developed through the conversations. The husband arrives and complains. He says he loves Christine and doesn't want a divorce. How kind is he? Will he drink on an empty stomach? Why is the plumbing so noisy? ""It is over."" They need an alibi. The next morning the wicker basket carries a heavy load. Back home the contents are dumped into the disused and dirty swimming pool. The schoolboys talk about their future. Will a body float to the top? A mistake requires the pool to be drained. The wife gets a shock. What happened? Whose key is that? A body is found in the Seine. Mme Christine goes to the morgue. The man in the morgue helps her get a taxi to St. Cloud. Can Inspector Fichet help to find the missing man?

Inspector Fichet explains that a suicide doesn't denude himself first. He questions the women. A young boy tells he saw the Principal! They have an explanation for his behavior. ""There is an explanation for everything."" A class photograph is taken; what is behind the window? Inspector Fichet arrives to make his report. Mme Delasalle tells him what happened, he sees the big picture. Later Mme Christine goes to check out the light on the second floor. Who is typing? Then Mme Christine gets the shock of her life. ""What do you think we'll get?' There is an ironic final scene. [Don't give away the ending!]

The problem with any complex plan is that it doesn't allow for the unexpected, or bad luck. What if Mme Christine didn't go to the morgue? Director H. G. Clouzot cast his wife Vera as Mme Christine. I wonder what part Simone Signoret played in real life? One value is showing life in France in the mid-1950s. Why are those students in a boarding school?",1481414400,,2419,4.592592592592593
738793,4,6303935125,"Classic post war noir.

Look and see France after the defeat of Vichy in a time capsule of post war seediness- 1953 drabness preserved for posterity. The plot is well known as two women one a wife and another a mistress of the same man conspire and murder a jerk who runs a boarding school for boys which is realistically institutional. Loud noise and vulgarity mark these boys as truly incarcerated under a jerk headmaster. The existential morgue where the body is or is not adds more gloom to a dark tale.

The plot twists and turns like the old CV2 mini truck transiting the affluent St. Cloud district of Paris. Is the outcome a mystery or supernatural or just maybe a product of mental delusion...a bad dream plot? The end shocked folks back in the fifties but we today are far too jaded.

738798,5,6303935125,"I was thirteen years old when taken by my parents to see this unbelievably scary movie. I remember sitting near the back row in a small art theater and near the end, the members of the audience did something I have never seen again; we stood up as a frightened mob staring in disbelief at what was showing on the screen. Some folks were actually screaming! As another reviewer pointed out the audience of today is probably jaded by so many newer movies that the effect may not be as startling as it was in 1955. There has also been a remake of the film so if you know how it ends the horror is muted a bit. If you want to scare your friends who have never seen either version, get it, break out the popcorn, and get ready to offer CPR! The quality of the video capture is excellent with crisp B&W images.  Acting and direction is superb.  This film is in French with English subtitles which I found to be clear and easy to read. Criterion can be trusted to handle old films with great care.

738921,5,6303935125,"For many years, the Film Noir Foundation and the American Film Institute Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland have sponsored an annual festival of film noir known as Noir City DC. The 2015 festival is currently ongoing and features a mix of familiar and unfamiliar noir films.

Sunday, October 18 at Noir City DC marked the showing of ""Diabolique"", the 1955 French film directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and was presented in celebration of the movie's 60th anniversary.  Eddie Muller, a scholar, writer, and enthusiastic proponent of noir gave a brief introduction to the film.  At the outset, Muller asked how many people in the good-sized audience had seen the film before.  Many hands went up, as should not be surprising in a festival directed to lovers of noir and crime film.  My hand was not among them, as I was coming to this classic film for the first time.  It was a treat to get to know this classic film in a theater on a large screen in the company of fellow lovers of film noir.

Genre lines are fluid, and ""Diabolique"" is at least as much a horror or suspense movie as a film noir.  The pigeon-holing doesn't much matter as the film has a right to its pride of place in Noir City DC or in any other film festival. The film tells the story of the brutal murder of an equally brutal master by his wife and mistress. The mistress teaches at the school while the dowry of the frail, ill wife provides the money to own and operate it. The film amply displays the man's thoroughly repulsive qualities before showing the two women plotting to do him in.  The women lure him to a small French village and do the deed in premeditated, careful fashion.  The women bring the body back to the school and dump it in the murky swimming pool in the hope that the body will soon rise to the surface.  An elderly, retired police detective becomes involved. Plans go awry and the movie works to a shocking climax.

The film features outstanding acting throughout by Simone Signoret, the mistress, Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, as the wife, Paul Meurisse as the husband and lover, and Charles Vanel as the detective. The grainy black and white cinematography focus on the grimness of the boarding school and of the bleak French countryside in the years after the war. Character development, pacing, acting, and tension give this movie its power.

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see this movie  on a large screen in a beautiful public theater where the film belongs. It took me a long time to get to know this film.  Lovers of film noir, horror or suspense film, or simply of classic cinema will want to see this great 1955 film, ""Diabolique"".

738923,5,6303935125,"The French Suspense Shocker that forewarned Hitchcock's Psycho. A movie based on the novel ""Celle qui n'tait plus l""; whose authors had written another work, ""D'entre les morts"", on which ""Vertigo"" is based.

Diabolique!

One of Clouzot's most popular works. With Vera Clouzot as Christine, the headmistress of her ""Institution Delasalle"" a boarding school in Saint-Cloud she directs with Michel, a cheap husband played by Paul Meurisse. A man who mistreats her and his students like a tyrant, for instance feeding them with cheap and tasteless meals, and who cheats behind his wife's back with Nicole, a teacher who works at the boarding school. A woman who's had enough of her lover's abusive manners and has concocted a plan. One she proposes to Christine, her sole friend in this ""huis-clos"" they work inside and in which the director makes us peep with his camera.
A murder so diabolical that it shocked its audience. And is still doing so today.
One that I don't dare reveal for fear of ruining other people's surprise. A silence which the director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, also asks his audience to follow as the film ends. To not be Diabolical and to not reveal the plot or its twist. Especially its astonishing ending that makes you jump in your seat, giving you shivers and asking how all of this could have happened. A finale certain film guides have had the disrespect of revealing.
Ruining a pleasure that this movie affords us. The chance of feeling a story's tension. Tragedy which Clouzot has had the brilliancy of not displaying any non-diegetic music, except a main theme during the starting and ending credits. An absence of music that makes the story more realistic, which a soundtrack would have ruined as it would have reminded to us that we are watching a movie. Whereas this time, he makes the drama more human, creating the tension through the actors' acting and his editing. As to whether or not Christine will do it or not. How will people will react to Nicole's plan's outcome if they do manage to succeed it. And will anyone find out the truth.

By the way, I have to applaud the cover Criterion did for their Blu-Ray release. An black-and-white engraving with gray and red as colors; artwork that also continues on the Blu-Ray's leaflet, which hints a little clue to the movie. One that still leaves goosebumps even if you've already watched the movie.

Of its special features, nothing too extravagant even for a film classic, which is astonishing considering the film's renown. A commentary, a video introduction on the movie by Serge Bromberg, who directed the documentary ""Inferno"", an intewrview with Kim Newman, the film's Original trailer in France, and a leaflet by film critics.
Which is a bummer as I wish we could have had more. Either a biography of Simone Signoret or on Vera Clouzot, or even interviews from the fifties about this movie.

Nevertheless, a good HD transfer of a classic with its original monaural sound.
A classic that has and is still leaving its mark on the public.

It also gives a good portrayal of life in 1950s.  While made in a French setting, it shows the pace of life back then.  You don't see stressed-out people running around in a frenzy as you do today.  People are pretty calm but of course the criminals involved are under great stress.

There is no need here to explain things to the audience at the end as if dealing with a bunch of idiots.

The mistress and the wife plan to kill the boarding master because of his abusive and tyrannical behavior towards both of them. However, things seem to take a bizarre turn after the deed is done...

Director H.G. Clouzot's Diabolique is an amazing film on several levels. It has the proper mood and build up to the final revelation. It has spot on performances by many of its leading actors. It is paced so thoroughly as to not reveal too much, but lead the audience through bits of fragmentary clues. A thriller really before its time, with a flair for the Hitchcock style.

Diabolique finishes with quite a flourish, an ending that both shocks and amazes. What I love about the ending of this film, in thinking about it now for a few days, is that it can be interpreted and construed at least three different ways. It is up to the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions.

This is one of those rare films that really makes you think about it afterwards. It is much more than sheer entertainment; it's a smart and sophisticated psychological thriller with a well-conceived plot that was, at the time of its making, quite unique and groundbreaking in the thriller genre. By today's standards, though, we've seen this type of method play out in many, many films, some quite effective and some not so much, so modern viewers might not appreciate what this film was at the time it was made.",1403654400,,1513,4.680451127819549

Apparently Hitchcock was a bit jealous at Clouzot being called the French ""Hitchcock"" after the success of this film and he borrowed elements from this film in making and marketing Psycho.  The film is very suspenseful, and the heroine sympathetic.  What I will remember most for a long time was the complete feeling of dreadful terror I had during the climax.

This is a film that requires rapt attention to the most minute details and even then you've probably guessed wrong.  The setting is a French boy's boarding school.  The wife of the headmaster(Vera Clouzot) and his mistress(Simone Signoret) are plotting the murder of the cruel cad.  To say anymore does the film a disservice.  The least I'll say is that it is reminiscent of Hitchcock, who allegedly was interested in making the film's source novel one of his projects, and probably influenced DePalma and Shyamalan when he was actually a good writer and director.  A lot of films nowadays pass themselves off as thrillers but they are pretty nondescript.

739113,5,6303935125,"A man has to be pretty terrible to inspire both his wife and mistress to kill him... especially if they decide to do it together.

And such a scenario kicks off ""Diabolique,"" a haunting thriller in the Hitchcock mold about a dead man who goes missing. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot gives the entire movie a murky, unromanticized air of dread, and he showed a mastery of the epic plot twist -- or rather, he showed mastery of SEVERAL epic plot twists, since the viewer won't know what's happening until the end.

Vicious Michel Delassalle (Meurisse) runs a boarding school for boys, but the school is actually owned by his frail, pious wife Christina (V&eacute;ra Clouzot). Since he believes she will never divorce him because of her religious faith, he has an open affair with one of the teachers, Nicole (Simone Signoret), whom he treats almost as badly as his wife.

The women actually get along pretty well... and they've decided to kill him. Despite Christina's misgivings, Nicole concocts a seemingly foolproof plan to kill the man who is making both their lives miserable.

So using the threat of a divorce, they lure him to a distant hotel room, drug him, and drown him in the bathtub. When they return to the school, they immediately sink him in a disgusting algae-filled swimming pool, having given themselves a pretty decent alibi. But when the pool is drained, the corpse is missing -- and a terrified Christina becomes convinced that their ruse will be discovered.

Reportedly Hitchcock missed out on buying the rights to the original novel ""Celle qui n'&eacute;tait plus"" by only a few hours. As fascinating as it is to imagine how he would have spun this story, there's nothing to criticize about Henri-Georges Clouzot's production -- this is the most raw, intense example of a psychological thriller.

There's a very strong feeling of realism in Clouzot's direction, rather than the Hollywood glossiness of the time. The school is grimy, the clothes are ordinary, the pool is full of algae and filth (and yes, they get a kid to leap in), and there's a running gag about noisy pipes. And against this realistic backdrop, Clouzot spins up a nightmarish scenario that almost drives Christina nuts.

So a lot of the movie is Clouzot slowly amping up the tension, making us ask, Where's the body? Who took it? Is Michel still alive somehow? There are some clever twists woven in here, which make you look back and realize how it all makes sense.

The movie rests on two great performances by Simone Signoret and the director's wife V&eacute;ra Clouzot (who ironically died of a heart attack a few years later).

There have been at least two other versions of this film, and neither have come anywhere near the expertise, the simplicity and the darkness of LES DIABOLIQUES.  And without a doubt, the diabolical ones have their own game upset by yet another unforeseen horror....no blood, no knives, no poison....just theatrics and medical anomalies and, voila, an evening that catches you by the throat and never lets go.

739237,5,6303935125,"Diabolique (1955) has a unique place in the history of cinema for being the first movie that pulled a shocking twist at the end. That's even before the Twilight Zone original TV series which is known for the shocking twists at the end of the episodes.

Christina is married to Michel who is a very mean guy and very abusive to Christina. Christina is also friends with Nicole, Michele's ex-mistress. Two women team up and make a diabolique plan to get rid of Michel.

My first criticism is that the obvious love triangle was censored. It is very likely that some sort of m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois is going on which then turns into lesbian relationship between two female characters. In fact, if I am not mistaken, in the actual novel, it is the male and the female character that make a plan to get ride of the other female character, who is evil. Due to censorship, the original source was altered and the love triangle angle is completely removed although it is not hard to guess that there is more to the relationship depicted on the screen.

My other criticism is the lack of musical score. I think a musical score could really have helped with creating suspense.

I disagree with the criticisms about the ending. Yes, the ending is open to interpretation; there is no doubt about that. However, depending on your interpretation, it can all make sense; the movie does not betray its premise.

I recommend this movie to all fans who enjoy foreign cinema and classic movies. The cinematography, acting, and the overall style is pretty artistic and it even sets the stage for Pyscho (1960).

739241,4,6303935125,"Michel (Paul Meurisse) is the principal of a private boys school in France.  His wife Christina (Vera Clouzot) owns the place, and his mistress Nicole (Simone Signoret) is a teacher at the school.  The affair between Michel and Nicole is hardly secret to the boys or the other teachers, and the two women have a relationship that isn't quite close but not exactly icy either.  It's a very ""European"" arrangement, I guess.

However, Michel treats both of his women terribly.  There is certainly physical abuse, but he is also verbally abusive and has a smallness of heart and a stinginess with both money and tender feeling.  The women are terrified by him.  And at Nicole's urging, they hatch a plot to kill the man who torments them.  It's a ""perfect murder"" that goes rather unusually awry.

I really don't want to give away more of the plot of DIABOLIQUE...which means I can barely discuss any more of the movie!  It's a famous, Hitchcockian movie from French director/writer Henri-Georges Clouzot (the brilliant WAGES OF FEAR).  DIABOLIQUE is a triumph of mood...it plays in the first half like a tense murder thriller and in the second half, like a kind of ghost story.  The plot is dense but easy to follow.  You see everything that happens quite clearly...except for one key mystery, and thus, you're never quite sure you know ANYTHING that's happening.  It's a tense, taut little thriller.

Plot-wise, it is hardly perfect though.  It relies a bit much (towards the end) on the character of a private detective who comes across a little like a French, 1950's Columbo.  And sometimes it relies just a bit much on having Michel behave exactly the way the women predict he will...this makes the early events seem a bit too manipulated for convenience.  I'll say no more about that...if you've seen the film, you know why this ""manipulativeness"" must be so.

On the other hand, the two female performances are quite fun.  This is 1950's movie acting, so it does feel a bit ""over-acted"" by today's standards...but these are very juicy roles.  Meurisse makes his character more than just a cardboard villian...yet also never goes quite so far as to show a soft-side.  We want this guy dead.  Signoret is the ""ice queen""...tall, cool and mostly in control of her feelings.  It is her wavering between cold detachment and bursts of emotion that lend the relationship between the two women a sexual charge.  Nothing is ever shown...no accidental brushing of fingers, no lingering gazes...yet Signoret has, in some way, seduced Vera into going along with her scheme.  This might not be a literal, physical seduction...but it feels charged.  Signoret makes that work.

Clouzet, who also appears in a very sexually overt way in WAGES OF FEAR, pretty much is only known for these two films directed by her husband.  She never became a great star...and it's possibly because she is a bit too naked and emotional.  In WAGES, she cravenly uses lust to try to get what she wants...at one time literally crawling on her hands and knees to beg a man.  In DIABOLIQUE, she is high-strung and nervous (she has a heart condition too).  She is not a woman men desire...she is a women poorly used by men because they sense her need for attention.  She's darker and much shorter than Signoret...and the two women are practically complete opposites.  They play off each other nicely, and ultimately, the film is Christina's story because Clouzot has made her the most recognizably like a real person.

The film is infamous for plot twists...but I have to say that they didn't hold much surprise for me.  That's no fault of the film...but rather, the fact that the movie is 55 years old and has been ripped off to one degree or another by many films sense.  I imagine it packed a wallop all those decades ago.  But even if the plot doesn't grab you from beginning to end...you'll appreciate the carefully crafted tone, the sly touches of humor to break up the serious events and the fine performances.

The Criterion blu-ray is excellent, of course.  I wish the commentary covered the whole film...but other than that, the other mini-documentaries are good, and the essay in the booklet is excellent.  There do seem to be, perhaps, fewer bits of ""goodies"" than usual...but this does not negate the quality of what is there.",1319241600,,4303,4.8

As Christina Delassalle, moneyed, religious, ailing wife of the sadistic headmaster of the boys' boarding school that she owns, Clouzot directed his real-life wife, Vera Clouzot (WAGES).  Michel Delassalle, the cruel headmaster of the school, was played by Paul Meurisse, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-of-Shadows-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B0047P5FSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army of Shadows: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray</a>]). Michel mentally and physically abuses Christina, not least by carrying on affairs with the female teachers at the school right in her face. Teacher Nicole Horner, played by the incomparable Simone Signoret, who played with Meurisse in ARMY, is his current mistress; we know that Michel abuses her too, as we meet her wearing dark glasses to hide a black eye.  Wife and mistress conspire to kill their tormentor; however, after the murder is committed, his body disappears from the neglected school pool where they have dumped it, and a series of strange, unsettling events begins to frighten the women, and, to be sure, the audience.  Le commissaire Alfred Fichet, the retired policeman who eventually puts the pieces together, is played by Charles Vanel, who also starred in WAGES.

The rundown Delassalle School is located in St Cloud, a historically, and still, well-to-do western suburb of Paris.  However, we do not see the town at its best, but in a constant, soggy drizzle of October rain.  To activate their murderous plan, the women must go to Niort, where Nicole owns a residence.  That town is about halfway between Nantes and Bordeaux, about 250 miles southwest of Paris (it was an 8-10 hour drive, given the roads and cars of the time, all done by the frail Christina). (Niort is also Clouzot's birthplace.)  The director's wife, Vera, an adept actress, is lovely in her part: for whatever his reasons, he has cast her again as a Venezuelan national, as I believe he did in WAGES, although WAGES  is set no more specifically than ""in South America.""  As Michel, and the commissioner,  Meurisse and Vanel fully inhabit their parts.  But to me, Signoret, with her Picassoesque monumentality, carries the picture, as she did so many others.

An American remake of the picture, called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diabolique/dp/0790750651/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diabolique</a>, was released in 1996.  Isabelle Adjani, Sharon Stone, and Chazz Palminteri starred; Shirley Knight and Kathy Bates also appeared, in this unnecessary, middling-quality suspenser.

Clouzot based his dark and icy thriller, a crime drama that was ranked No. 49 on the Bravo network's ""100 Scariest Movie Moments,"" on a best seller, the 1952 novel CELLE QUI N'ETAIT PLUS (She Who Was No More) by noted French science fiction writer Pierre Boileau, and Thomas Narcejac. Clouzot adapted the novel for the screen; he also produced it, as well as directing it.  I've certainly seen this picture more than once, but believe me; I still nearly jumped off my sofa at the Grand Guignol goings-on.",1313712000,,4112,6.7137476459510355
739243,5,6303935125,"Psycho is called the forefather of slasher films and is a great influential film. But, there was a film before it that was and still is influential that even influence Hitchcock's masterpiece, and that film is Henri-Georges Clouzot's Diabolique. Released five years before Psycho, Diabolique is the story of two women who plan and murder a man who is bad to them. One is the man's wife and the other is the mistress. The husband is abussive to both of them and after some time they grow tired and decide to wipe him from this life.

I won't say anything else about the plot because the movie is full of twists that you'll have to see it in order to enjoy it. Like the warning card at the end of the film says: ""Don't be a devil and don't spoil what you just saw"". Diabolique is a marvelous film where you will chop your nails on wondering what is happening and even if you think you know what's going on then something will happen that will make you realize you don't know nothing at all. The atmosphere that Clouzot built in the film is marvelous. Since the beginning, you sense that something is wrong and that uncomfortable feeling stays with you through the entire film. The performances are great with Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret being great as the murderous women. The ending will leave you in shock because is really unexpected. Diabolique is a great suspenseful film and will lead the way to other films each one of them influenced by this classic in one way or another.

Video & Audio:
Criterion has done an excellent job with Diabolique. The transfer is pretty clean and detail is clear. Some images appear soft and in some scenes there is some minor damage. Blacks and whites are strong as is contrast and film grain is pretty intact. A great transfer.

The french PCM monoaural track is also great with clear dialogue and without signs of hiss or damage.

Bonus Features:
Diabolique doesn't come as packed like other Criterion releases but what is included in this set is great. First you have a selected-scene audiocommentary with french film scholar Kelley Konway, while it would have been better if the audiocommentary was for the whole film, this one is informative and well done. Then you have a introduction by Serge Bromberg that talks about the importance of Diabolique and the films of Clouzot in general, then you have an interview with film critic Kim Newman that discusses the influece that Diabolique has in subsequent films including Psycho and last you have the theatrical trailer.

The set comes with a booklet featuring an essay by Terrence Rafferty.

Closing Thoughts:
Diabolique is a must-see film for suspense lovers and film in general. With an amazing plot, commendable performances and a shocking ending, Diabolique is a true classic. This Criterion set gives the film a great restoration and enlightening bonus features and comes highly recommended.",1312934400,,2890,4.781563126252505
739244,5,6303935125,"Although the French have never really supported gothic horror as a genre, DIABOLIQUE (or THE DEVILS as it is known in France) is certainly a reflection of what Hitchcock's cinematic artistic ambitions were all about; i.e., dark and morbid tales of murder and revenge and sly wit.

Director Clouzot's wife Vera stars as Christina Delassalle, a pretty, young and fragile French girl who is married to a cruel headmaster of a private boys' school where they also live.  Her sadistic husband (Paul Meurisse) is having an open affair with one of the teachers, the icy Nichole Horner (superbly played by Simone Signoret).  Tired of the cruelty and abuse, Nichole and Christina agree to murder him, but neither is prepared for the surprises that follow that fateful decision.

This gripping tale is not really a murder mystery because we see what the two protagonists are up to.  They seem to share a loathing for the victim.  And of course money is a factor.

At heart, this is an early psychological thriller about two women dealing with the consequences of a shared crime that has a different meaning to each of them.  And more than that, it is about the slow disintegration of Christina's mental and physical health as unexpected and frightening events unfold after the apparent murder.

Although we (in the audience) are not so much rooting for any of the characters and we do not exactly share in the feeling that the headmaster deserves to die, we are very concerned about what we see unfolding.  Strange, disconcerting twists and frightening images jolt us as we try and make sense of the crime and its aftermath.

Compelling and moody imagery abound in the dark corridors of the school and living quarters.  It feels like a horror movie but the threat is unsettlingly ambiguous.

Part of the plot involves Christina's weak heart.

In real life, Vera Clouzot had a heart ailment similar to the one her character suffers in the film.  Sadly, Vera Clouzot died from this condition a few years after the film was released.

The new high-definition transfer of this classic film is superb and the extras are all interesting and watchable.  I especially appreciate the uncompressed monaural soundtrack.  It's a perfect match for the full frame, black and white images.

739331,5,6303935125,"The Devils"" (its English translation)turned out to be an influential mystery thriller with enough twists and turns in both story and technique to influence a wide variety of film directors. Henri'Georges Clouzot's was a masterpiece of deception on more than one level. It's well known by most folks that Hitchcock wanted to option the novel that is the basis for this film and ended up optioning ANOTHER novel by the same authors which he turned into his classic film ""Vertigo"". ""Diabolique"" had a huge impact on Hitchcock and other film directors most of them lesser talents--the influence of this film along with Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" showed up in Hitch's groundbreaking classic film ""Psycho"" in a number of ways and Hitchcock showed screenwriter Joseph Stefano both this film and ""Vertigo"" prior to Stefano penning the screenplay for ""Psycho"".

Criterion has given the film ""Diabolique"" the deluxe treatment for its blu-ray debut; remastered from the camera negative in high def the film looks positively stunning. the bit rate for the film is high throughout insuring a smooth looking goregous look to this classic the 1955 film. The mono audio receives the same care with a 24 bit transfer capturing every nuance possible.

As with all of the Criterion films this one also has some nice extras. We get a scene specific commentary track by film scholar Kelley Conway. It's not bad although not as revealing as I would have hoped. Horror film expert Kim Newman also gives us his opinion of the film with plenty of clips illustrating how and why it was influential on other horror/thrillers. I would have preferred something a bit more involved that also used clips from other films illustrating some of his comments but that would have required licensing requirements that may have made it impossible to do so.

We also get a new interview with Serge Bromberg who co-directed ""Infero"" with Clouzot. There's also a very good essay by film critic Terence Rafferty discussing the film, Clouzot's career and the negative impact that the ""New Wave"" critics had on the director's career.

The nicest part is the new translation of the dialogue which (I don't speak French mind you)appears to give a better translation of the dialogue from what I've been told.

I'd love to see Criterion give Clouzot's ""The Wages of Fear"" the same loving transfer to blu-ray.

Time hasn't dulled the impact of the film although its imitators have stolen some of the luster from this classic film for their own cheap thrills none of them has quite equaled the impact of the original film. Only Hitchcock and Welles proved able to craft thrillers as deft, brilliant and ground breaking as Clouzot's film during their career.

739332,5,6303935125,"DIABOLIQUE (1955) is the sort of shocking, groundbreaking thriller that world audiences would have expected to see from director Alfred Hitchcock.  In fact, Hitchcock, at one time, had attempted to secure the rights to the novel (by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac) from which it was adapted.

Instead, the picture was made in France, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and became the foundation for hundreds of later movie thrillers...even some directed by Hitchcock.  Hitchcock and others may have improved on the techniques employed by Clouzot, but it all began with DIABOLIQUE.

According to film critic Kim Newman, who supplies an on-camera interview in the ""Special Features"" section of the new release from The Criterion Collection, DIABOLIQUE was the first ""major"" film to feature a ""twist,"" as opposed to a ""surprise"" ending.  In other words, and without going into specifics, at the end of the film you realize that you have been watching an entirely different story from what you thought you'd been watching.

DIABOLIQUE tells of two women, the fragile wife (Vera Clouzot) and willful mistress (Simone Signoret) of the nasty headmaster (Paul Meurisse) of a boy's boarding school, who decide to murder him, then make it appear like he drowned in the school's swimming pool.  The plan is perfectly executed...until the pool is drained and the body is not there.

This film is pushing sixty-years old, yet it is just as suspenseful today as it was when it was first released, and it's a hell of a lot better than so many of the over-blown cgi thrillers that are made these days.

Aside from the Newman interview, other ""extras"" for this new digital restoration of the film include audio commentary by scholar Kelley Conway, a video introduction by filmmaker Serge Bromberg and a booklet with an essay by film critic Terrence Rafferty.

739333,5,6303935125,"Christina Delassalle: Do you believe in Hell?
Nicole Horner: Not since I was seven.
Christina Delassalle: I do.

A milestone in suspense films, LES DIABOLIQUES (aka ""The Fiends"") presents a story that's been told many times, but seldom as well...or as chillingly.  Director Henri-Georges Clouzot reportedly beat Hitchcock to the screenrights of ""Celle qui n'tait plus"" (the novel which forms the basis of DIABOLIQUES by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac); and it's been said that Hitchcock tried to emulate Clouzot's DIABOLIQUES in several of his later films, including ""Psycho"".

DIABOLIQUES is the story of two women, bound together by their love and hatred for a single man.  At a run-down boarding school in France, led by stern headmaster Michel Delassalle (Paul Meurisse), his meek wife Christina (Vra Clouzot) and abused mistress Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) conspire to kill him.  Using a long weekend holiday, they lure Michel away from the school to Nicole's boarding-house in another town, where he is drugged, drowned in a bathtub, and then taken back to the school to be dumped in the murky swimming pool.  Christina's resolve quickly crumbles and the women find a convenient way to ask for the pool to be drained, where it's revealed that Michel's body has gone missing.  Soon after, children of the boarding school talk about seeing the disappeared headmaster doling out his usual punishments; and the women are taunted by cryptic notes...  Is Michel still alive, and if he's not, who knows about the women's crime?

This film is a true masterwork.  The story of what happens when the ""Perfect Crime"" becomes unravelled by paranoia and guilt, DIABOLIQUES is a sheer tour-de-force for Vra Clouzot and Simone Signoret, who deliver some of their best performances.  True, Signoret has the flashier role as Michel's confident, tough and vivacious mistress, but Clouzot has a rangier part as his weak, fragile wife who literally begins to crumble under the strain of the murder and it's aftermath.  The photography is superb.  A great example of ""less is more"", the look of the film adds to it's character, with the boarding school almost becoming a key player in the story.

This psychological thriller was to influence Alfred Hitchcock's later films including ""Psycho""(1960) and ""Vertigo""(1958).

It must have galled Hitch to have lost out to Henri Clouzot in making this film. It is right up his alley as a classic suspense film.

Suffice to say Diabolique is a creepy little thriller that sticks with you long after you've seen it. In fact, it never actually leaves your mind. Decay and decadence permeates the boys' school grounds. You know in advance that no good will come of this.

The acting is superb, and this film is rightfully remembered as one of Simone Signoret's best performances as the world weary hussy schoolmarm. Vera Clouzot is multi-layered as the put-upon, frazzled wife. Both women are riveting.

739384,5,6303935125,"This classic suspense thriller offers all of the character and drive of Hitchcock's later masterpieces with its own unique look and feel. A woman and her husband's mistress plot to kill the man that has been oppressing each of them, but suspicions mount after the corpse of their drowned lover disappears from the pool where they planted the body. Was Michel really dead, or has someone discovered their deadly secret? Clouzot delivers a visually stunning film with fluid camera movements and inventive tracking shots. The flawed character of Christine is built in such a way that it is impossible to find fault in her actions, especially after she is beaten by her dominating husband while trying to slap a poisoned drink from his hand in a moment of fear and doubt. A recurring mirror motif constantly reflects Christine's guilt, as she is the only character to have her image cast back repeatedly throughout the film. Signoret plays Nicole as an emotionless and robotic femme fatale, however her cold demeanor and actions along with the impossible appearances of M. Delassalle after the disappearance of the body lead to an all too predictable end. The slow and methodical build is expertly handled, and only further strengthened by an excellent cast. Hitchcock fans will find everything to love in DIABOLIQUE, even if it falls just short of a perfect film.

739386,5,6303935125,"Dear MKIA,

We've been friends for some time here on Ammy (twins we could say) and so I often think of what you may think when watching a certain film, and this film in particular really `spoke' to me.  I know that this is totally your territory (horror movie) but it is also a film I am nearly certain you haven't seen (beings that you are not a huge fan of the foreign film).  That is why I am writing you this letter.

I saw this film a few years ago and loved it, but it wasn't until some of your recent reviews (and recent comments on my reviews) that I truly understood how deeply your love for this brand of cinema runs, and so I rewatched this film this past weekend (along with another chilling masterpiece I'll get to later) and became convinced that YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS!

The film tells of a cruel headmaster at an all boy's school who is murdered by his wife and lover.  Then the body disappears and the two women, especially the frail hearted wife, start to lose it.

It's like Hitchcock only MUCH darker.  Some have note that there is a lack of human emotion here, that everyone seems cold and it is apparent that the director had a distain for the characters, but for me that is an elevation of the films darkness.  It is sublimely chilling, completely ransacked with this deep-running evil that just breaks the audience apart piece by piece.

I am convinced you will love this.

The acting across the board is breathtaking.  Paul Meurisse is marvelous as Michel, the doomed headmaster.  He has only a few scenes in the very beginning, but his performance is chilling to say the least.  He is strong and empowered and commanding; and his final confrontation with his wife is beautifully controlled (even the flourishes of outrage feel naturally expected).  The two lead women are stunning in very different ways.  Simone Signoret is a marvel as Nicole, the hardened mistress to the deceased.  She has a very chilly humor to her dialog that makes her a memorable force.  Vera Clouzot (the director's own wife) displays a very different quality to her scenes.  She is far more reserved, humbled and nave; and her final scene is astonishing.

Hand...over...heart...GASP!

Despite the subtitles (the movie is in French buddy) I really urge you to see this ASAP!  It is a stunner and one that you will ADORE.  It has been remade in 1990 with Sharon Stone, but it was trashed by critics (and I hear it was a complete mess so avoid it, as I have).  This is a goldmine for any fan of the genre, as you are my friend.

Honestly, I was thinking throughtout the movie that the mistress was really a man which would have been what I considered a shocking ending.  However, the real ending was expected and not a surprise at all. The movie was also way too long and just seemed to drag along.  I'm also not a big fan of subtitles since I can't fully watch the acting while reading the titles (and it does seem like French subtitles go really fast).

739388,5,6303935125,"""Diabolique"" (Les diaboliques) is a masterpiece of suspense made in perhaps the most masterful decade of suspenseful cinema, the 1950s. While Alfred Hitchcock's career was at its peak, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot acquired the rights to the novel ""Celle que n'tait plus"" (She Who Was No More) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac and, in 1955, created ""Diabolique"". A country boarding school in France hosts the uneasy relationship between sadistic principal Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), his wealthy South American wife Christina (Vra Clouzot), and his bold mistress Nicole (Simone Signoret). Unwilling to divorce her abusive husband for religious reasons, Christina consents to Nicole's plan to murder him. All goes well until the corpse goes missing.

 ""Diabolique"" leaves the audience as uncertain as to what is going on as the characters who are caught up in it. Christina is fearful of sin, but she can no longer tolerate her husband's beatings and humiliation. Nicole is an unlikely ally who has the necessary cool and calculating head to get away with murder. But when the unexpected happens, even the audience is unsure of Michel is really dead. Christina's nerves are frazzled. To make matters worse, a creepy private detective insists upon helping her find her missing husband. We have no idea what he might be up to, but it doesn't look good. This kind of uncertainty creates the sense of chaos that leaves Christina and Nicole panicked and the audience on edge too. In French with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Criterion Collection 1999): The print is good but does have some white specks. Sound is good. The subtitles are white on a black-and-white film, which causes some strain in reading them. Yellow subtitles would have been better. Oddly, Michel's name is subtitled as ""Miguel"" at the beginning of the film and is corrected later.

The acting is superb.  The cinematography is eerie and lends to the mood of the film.  And the story is so original and exciting it is no wonder so many have tried to recreate its supernatural magic.

In an attempt to free themselves from his cruel clutches, the mistress and the wife plot the perfect murder ... but something goes wrong ...

The DVD itself is great.  Good sound and an excellent picture quality.

Christina is a fragile young woman with a weak heart and is tormented by her adulterous husband who is having an affair with Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), a strong, forceful teacher who has been his mistress from the day she arrived. He has, however, treated her as badly as his wife, and the two women have been driven into an alliance against him. Together they work out an elaborate plan to rid themselves of their common tormentor. Luring him away from the school to Nicole's cheap lodging house, they induce him to drink some doctored whiskey - and drown him in a bath. The body is later wrapped in a nylon tablecloth, packed into a laundry basket, taken back to the school, and at dark plunged into the grimy water of the school swimming pool. When, shortly after, the pool is drained, watched in anguished expectation from a window by the women, no corpse is there.

739492,5,6303935125,"There are countless reviews of this seminal film to be read on the internet, so I shall direct my focus away from the aspects with which most of them deal.

Consider, for example the backdrops.  Have you noticed how detailed and intricate they are?  Every cobblestone in a street is seen, every crease on a bedcover, every scratch on a door handle - every shot is crammed with detail.  I cannot recall seeing a blank wall or a plain open space.

This richness of visual detail is usually missing in Hitchcock films.  I also find a richer dialogue than Hitchcock at this period ever provided.  Richer too is the cast of eccentrics, drunkards, neighbours, and bit players.  The drunkard who attempts to secrete himself in the back of the van containing the body in the basket, once seen, is never forgotten.

Writers Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac wrote the novel and the film rights were obtained by Clouzot only hours before Hitchcock's bid was received.  Never mind if Simone Signoret usually has a cigarette protruding from her mouth in the early scenes, never mind that she and Vera Clouzot are made to totter around on the absurdly high-heeled shoes women wore in the mid 1950s, this is a film that will look good and captivate audiences forever.",1189209600,,1254,4.7373271889400925

I have seen both English and French versions - and I must say For a non-French-speaking-person - the English dub is superior. Reading subtltles in this horror film distances you from the film and kills off much of the suspence. The voices in the French version were looped as well - so there is really no high-brow advantage to seeing the film with subtitles.

Criterion's print is great as usual but disapointing without the English version - So - For me I will conintue to watch my old English dubbed VHS tape until someone comes out with a quality English version of this film on DVD.

Clouzot) when making his own masterpiece Psycho. In fact, the biggest problem with this film, when it comes down to it is that it's too influential. So much so that a lot of people won't be surprised by the twist ending and leaves-you-thinking fade out scene. Even if it surprises you, you'll recognize...It's been done so many times. This movie itself was even remade with Sharon Stone. Anyway, the movie takes place at a boys school run by Michel Delassalle (Paul Meurisse); A hateful, cold man who abuses his wife Christina (Vera Clouzot, who I believe was the directors wife), who owns the school. He's also having an affair with Nicole (Simone Signoret). Not the typical movie affair where everything's hush-hush. Even the students at the school know. Michel has already began abusing Nicole and the women decide that they've had enough. It's not just the abuse that worries them either. Christina has a heart condition and if she dies, Michel gets the school. They plan the murder quickly, yet efficiently. They lure him to a place far from the school, slip him a sedative via glass of wine, and drown him in a bathtub. Then, they dump his body into the pool at the school. Things go well for a little bit, but then the suit Michel was killed (and dumped) in arrives from the dry cleaners. Disturbed by this, Christina asks that the pool be drained. When it is, no body is found. Overcome by nervousness, Christina inadvertently hires a private detective named Alfred Fichet...She doesn't want to, but he makes her nervous and points out inconsistencies in her stories. Disturbing events continue to develop, including a young boy who claims Michel had just punished him and then there's the figure standing in the window behind the boys in a school photograph. It's all pretty intriguing stuff. The movie then leads up to one of the best twist endings (at the time) in history. The end title card even warns audiences not to tell people what they've seen. The final moment of the film is creepy and unsettling, but it a perfect way to end the film. This isn't a horror film that people used to today's standards of horror would like. This is no Hills Have Eyes or Hostel. This deserves more comparison to films like Rosemary's Baby and Psycho (the Hitchcock version, not the Gus Van Sant). It's got moments of really disturbing stuff and it's a very important film. And it's available in a pretty good (I'd give it 4/5) transfer from The Criterion Collection.

""Diabolique"" is also gifted with great direction and acting but it is the compelling story that drew me in and kept me focussed throughout the movie.

The problem with reviewing ""Diabolique"" is that one dare not say too much.  The direction that the plot takes us makes a few sharp turns before eventually ariving at the end.

739563,5,6303935125,"`Diabolique' (`The Devils'), a 1956 French language film directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, starring Simone Signoret, is an uncanny take on the thriller genre mastered by Alfred Hitchcock. The cover text even says Hitchcock borrowed some ideas for `Psycho' from this movie, although I don't really see many similarities, except for the fact that `Diabolique' has a plaque on the screen after `The End' which admonishes the audience against telling potential audience members anything about the ending. The other loose similarity is that one of the principle cast members, no not Signoret, is seen being killed off early in the movie.

A third very loose similarity between `Diabolique' and `Psycho' is that while there is never any real supernatural occurrences, there are a number of suspicious events which smack of supernatural goings on. In fact, that may be one of the great strengths of both Hitchcock and this movie in their creating reasons to believe in events which are simply impossible due to ordinary explanations, bringing out the suspicion of some supernatural goings on.

The story is centered on a suburban Paris boys school owned by the headmaster, acquired as part of the dowry from his wife, a sickly young woman who also teaches at the school. The three other instructors are two other men plus a female teacher played by Signoret, who also happens to be the headmaster's mistress.

It becomes known early in the movie that the headmaster appears to be abusive to both wife and mistress. This leads to the act which drives the action for most of the movie, when mistress and wife conspire to drive to a town about five hours away from Paris, call the headmaster to say the wife wants a divorce, forcing the headmaster to take a train to retrieve his wife. While mistress visits two of her tenants in an upstairs apartment, wife gets husband to take several drinks from a bottle of drugged Johnny Walker scotch, a whisky simply too rich for the penurious headmaster to pass up.

When headmaster passes out, wife and mistress drown the headmaster in the bathtub, tote the body down to the school van, drive back to Paris, arriving at the school late at night, and roll the body into the school's scummy, cloudy water of the swimming pool. The mistress claims that after a few hours of putrefaction, the corpse will rise to the surface, be discovered, and the time of death by drowning will be placed while the two women are out of town.

The real fun begins when the body does not come to the surface and is not found, even after one of the students dives into the pool looking for a set of lost keys. The perfect setup for supernatural hypotheses.

The very best aspect of this mystery is that in the end, all the clues fall into place, there are no loose ends, and if fact, no supernatural agent was ever really involved, in spite of the fact that for a third of the movie, there was imply no other explanation for what was going on.

The translation, based on my very rudimentary French, was pretty good, but not perfect. I would still prefer the subtitles to an even less perfect dubbing.

While this movie may not exhibit technique and psychological insights worthy of Renoir or Truffout, it is really great stuff, comparable to some of Hitchcock's best, but without the star power of Stewart, Peck, Olivier, or Grant. There are even some excellent red herrings that convince us that the perps will be found out much sooner and easier than they are. The only oddity, if the police were to catch on the fact that there was murder afoot here is the fact that the wife waited more than 24 hours to file a missing person's report.

An excellent PSYCHOlogical thriller!",1134777600,,3688,4.73208722741433

Only the body disappears and then suddenly begins showing up in the oddest places. The ending is a real surprise - in fact, there just might be more than one surprise. It's a terrific idea and well executed. And those last 15 minutes will have your head spinning. Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Definitely worth a watch.",1134432000,,677,4.467741935483871
739565,5,6303935125,"Director Henri-Georges Clouzot really ratchets up the tension in his 1955 offering of intrigue and deception ""Diabolique"".  Creating the feeling of dread with his tawdry, decrepit black and white settings, Clouzot uses them to amplify the feeling of unease within his audience.

Paul Meurisse playing Michel Delasalle is the boorish, misogynistic headmaster of a second rate boys boarding school that his wife owns. Meurisse siphons money out of the school to lavish himself.  He brutalizes both his weak hearted wife Christina played by Vera Clouzot and his mistress Nicole Horner played by Simone Signoret who are both teachers at the school.  He shows disdain for all those around him including students and teachers.  Signoret and Clouzot tiring of the abuse make a pact and plot to murder him.

They lure him to Signoret's home town by having Clouzot threaten him with divorce.  While there they drug his scotch and eventually drown him in the bathtub.  After establishing alibis they transport his body back to the school in a large wicker trunk where they dump him into the slimy waters of the swimming pool.

Clouzot eventually starts feeling guilty and has the pool drained only to find his Meurisse's body has disappeared.  Things start happening that give the impression that Meurisse may still be alive.  When a retired cop starts nosing around the premises the feeling of tension becomes elevated.  The pressure causes Signoret and Clouzon to sever their bond and Signoret departs the school.

So it is this feeling of masterful suspense that makes us think of other films - like Psycho for example.  That being said, I think 'diabolique' is every bit as original, stylish, and well-made as anything Hitchcock made.

739569,5,6303935125,"If ""Diabolique"" influenced Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", one would have to say that the classic French film exceeds the 'classic' American slasher flick.
In a twisted and at times really confused turn of events, a shy schoolmarm teams up with her husband's mistress to kill him (or so we think). The husband is a real SOB, constantly bossing both of them around and treating his students like dogs.  Since he is in a position of provincial power, however, his petty control games and short temper go unremarked upon.  There are tones of lesbianism in this sleek thriller, with the wife and mistress and forming (*(it seems*) a strong bond in their hatred of the husband.  The only lucid character we have is a private investigator who precipitates a tragedy, perhaps without knowing it.  (Or is he in on it too?_
I won't spoil the rest of the film for the viewer, but it would be safe to say that this is one of the strangest plots I have ever encountered, and one of the most intriguing.  We are confronted with weakness versus strength, good versus evil, and the standard collection of themes, but in a subtle, disturbing fashion.  The last scene in the film, when a child comments on the schoolmarm's appearance in the school, is enough to leave one wondering whether there is yet another element at work which we have not yet seen.  This is far better than ""Psycho"", although one can see the parallels.  A must see.",1089763200,,1411,4.661290322580645
739570,3,6303935125,"DIABOLIQUE is a cautionary tale about the need to keep your swimming pool clean, or not, depending on the state of your marriage.
Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot) owns a French boarding school for boys, which she runs with her husband Michel (Paul Meurisse). Also in residence is Michel's mistress, Nicole (Simone Signoret). The two women have become uneasy allies against Michel, who physically and emotionally abuses Christina. The two plot his murder.
Over a holiday weekend, during which the school will be deserted except for the caretaker, Nicole and Christina motor off to Nicole's primary residence in a town some miles away, the latter without Michel's permission. Once the women are at Nicole's place, Michel is called knowing he'll immediately come to retrieve his wayward wife without telling the caretaker. He does what's predicted. Some whiskey is drugged; Michel drinks it and falls asleep. The plotters subsequently drown the brute in the bathtub, placing a heavy bronze statue on his chest to keep him underwater overnight. The next day, the body is schlepped back to the school in a trunk-sized basket, and subsequently dumped into a swimming pool so filthy that the bottom is invisible. The working hypothesis is that once Michel floats to the surface, he'll be thought to have drowned there. But the corpse never appears and isn't part of the sludge at the bottom when the pool is drained, ostensibly to recover some lost keys. Uh-oh. And he looked mighty dead to me.
DIABOLIQUE probably worked better when it was originally released (1955). It was a simpler time. I really didn't become engaged with the plot until the water was drained from the pool and ... voila! The last third of the film provided an opportunity for mild intellectual curiosity, and the last ten minutes or so a modicum of suspense. Virtually useless was Alfred Fichet (Charles Vanel), the ex-police official turned detective, who leisurely investigates and makes Peter Falk's Columbo seem positively animated in comparison.
As a child of the latter half of the twentieth century, I can't but believe that special effects and color cinematography, combined with edgier sound, could produce a more knuckle-biting experience. (Ok, ok. I know that Sharon Stone did a panned remake of DIABOLIQUE in 1996. But I'm thinking of actresses of the caliber of, say, Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett in the Christina and Nicole roles respectively.) Perhaps it's just because I resent the fact that the original version has been decribed as a ""grisly, horror classic"" when, to my mind, it's just dated and neither grisly nor horrific.",1078358400,,2615,5.0979020979020975

For anyone who reveals the surprise ending, this would be a crime even more atrocious than the one depicted in the movie, and should be punishable by a re-instated guillotine !
Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot are unforgettable in the leads, each character playing beautifully off the other. One other comment--this is a 50s film, yet schoolboys are portrayed with brutal accuracy--they swear, act rudely, are preocuupied with sex--these are real children, not those that are found in Disney films.
The DVD is nice--some wear is visible here and there, but does not detract from your experience. Of course, the film is in French, but the subtitles are smooth. The absence of music is another plus. In some Hollywood suspense films, you can tell that ""something is about to happen"" because of the music--not the case here.

739632,5,6303935125,"Based on the Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac novel CELLE QUI N'ETAIT PLUS, Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 DIABOLIQUE is easily among the most influential films of world cinema, leaving its mark on everything from Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO and PSYCHO to William Castle's THE TINGLER--but even so, and while Hitchcock's masterpieces can be said to at least equal the Clouzot original, few if any of the films spawned by DIABOLIQUE ever bested it.
Variously known as DIABOLIQUE, LES DIABOLIQUES, and THE DEVILS, the film presents a complex story.  Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot, wife of director Henri-Georges Clouzot), is a remarkably beautiful and considerably wealthy woman who has the misfortune to suffer from delicate health, personal timidity, and brutish husband Michel (Paul Meurisse.)  The two operate a boys' school that Christina owns, and among the teachers is hard-nosed Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), who has become Michel's mistress but who finds Michel every bit as unpleasant as wife Christina.  An unlikely alliance springs up between the two women, and together they conspire to murder Michel and thereafter run the school for themselves.  But although the murder seems to go as planned, the body goes missing, and the two women suddenly find themselves taunted by mysterious notes and strange happenings.  Has Michel survived the attempt on his life?  Or has the murder been discovered and the stage is being set for blackmail?
In the wake of DIABOLIQUE's international success, the story has been told in so many variations that many may consider the original has lost some of the shock value it possessed when it first debuted, but even so the film has much to offer.  This is particularly true in terms of style of performances.  Director Clouzot endows the film with a sense of visual decay and a near-documentary tone that merge to create one of the most chilling atmospheres ever captured on screen.  While Signoret's performance of the angry mistress is the more widely celebrated, she is equaled by Vera Clouzot, who has the more complex role and whose performance must carry the weight of the film's most disturbing moments; together they create a truly remarkable synergy of the most lethal kind.
I have seen DIABOLIQUE in several different releases, and while the Criterion DVD is somewhat glitchy it is easily the best version available; one should avoid all other releases, particularly the truly atrocious release by Madacy.  Strongly recommended, particularly to fans of internation cinema and classic suspense.",1054425600,,2552,5.263546798029557

I just saw it again last week and thought, ""What was I thinking?""  The pacing is slow and dreary, and the acting isn't even all that great.  The plot, while interesting, is not well executed and dragged like crazy.
We're asked to suspend WAY too much reality in order to buy the multiple twists at the end.  (SPOILERS AHEAD)  First of all, how in the world did that dead man manage to stay under water for that long without gasping for air?  It's never explained to us.  After that, was his body somehow replaced before being shoved into the crate and driven back to the estate, or did the (live) man actually live and breathe in that box, wrapped in plastic, for the entire drive back?
And the biggest incredible suspension of belief factor in this movie:  If the cops were on to the bad guys for so long, WHY, OH WHY, would they sit back and WAIT until they've killed the headmistress of shock before they emerge from the shadows to arrest them?  I mean, an integral part of the conniving scheme was thinking that this woman was too weak of heart to do much on her own; surely if the cops had figured out the scheme they would have interceded BEFORE someone else had to die, right?  Even worse is that it all happens within the space of minutes:  Headmistress sees husband (whom she thought was dead), headmistress keels over and dies, and cop emerges from the shadows.  Hey, copper, could you not have stepped forward just a few seconds earlier, when you might have been able to save her life?

When I showed it to my students, they shrieked, giggled nervously, and tossed their jackets over their eyes. Today's youthful spectators, accustomed to seeing nothing but buckets of blood tossed at the screen by modern filmmakers, are easy marks for an old-school terror movie that grips the viewer surreptitiously through gradually mounting suspense. The supposedly significant nine minutes of added footage don't amount to much, however -- mostly just some unnecessary chatter during the hotel scene.

This tense tale of two female schoolteachers at an abysmal school for boys who do away with the tyrannical headmaster (who is married to the weak one and lovers with the stronger one) has been masterfully presented by Criterion. The grim b&w photography and the dismal school create the perfect creepy mood for this tale of murder and irony. Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot (the director's wife) are the doomed pair who plot the almost perfect crime---only to find mounting evidence that their victim has returned. The classic nerve-wracking climax and spooky ending still hold up well. Don't miss this wonderful chiller. They truly don't make 'em like this anymore.,1035158400,,820,5.0814814814814815
739636,3,6303935125,"It is no secret that this is a classic suspense film in every sense.  It would seem only natural that Criterion would pick this film to be part of their revered collection.  Most people who are willing to spend the kind of money that it takes to acquire a Criterion disc take comfort in the knowledge that they will experience the highest possible picture and sound quality possible for the particular film.  Well, with the disc of Diabolique, that is just not the case.  The film is loaded with dirt, grain, holes, tears, and even splices.  At one point in viewing the disc I noticed a large circle flash by.  I scanned back and paused on the frame to see that what appears to be a melted spot on the film had been circled, perhaps for removal later.  It is still there, though.  Also, the picture had a slight vibrating quality about it through the whole movie which was an annoyance.  The picture is watchable, but for the price and the Criterion name, I expected much, much more.  There are some serious issues with the sound as well.  There is a constant low hiss on the soundtrack that can be distracting.  The subtitles are pale and hard to read.  I always enjoy watching the restoration demonstration on Criterion discs.  I like seeing how huge picture defects can be erased just like magic.  This movie obviously never recieved such treatment.  I find it hard to believe that any restoration work at all was done to Diabolique before it was dumped on the market.  Basically, the movie is definitely worth seeing, but do not assume anything simply because this is a Criterion disc.

739637,5,6303935125,"Vera Clouzot stars as Chritina Delasalle, the abused mousy wife of Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), the tyranical headmaster of a run-down French boarding school for boys.  Despite being the rightful owner as well as a teacher at the school, Christina lives in terror of her husband, fearing violent reprisal should she leave him or try to stand up to him.  She does not even protest when her husband has an affair with another teacher at the school, Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret).  However, when Nicole experiences the violent wrath of Mr. Delasalle, the two women deside it is time to get rid of the man who has caused them so much misery.
The plan seems to be a success.  Michel is drugged, drowned, and then tossed in the school swimming pool.  But when the pool is drained, no body is found and the women feel Michel's presence more than ever.
This truly classic chiller builds to one of the most frightening and suspenseful climaxes I've ever seen.  It's also got one of filmdoms greatest twist endings which I wouldn't dream of revealing.  Michel Delasalle is one of the most despicable men ever portrayed.  Besides treating both his wife and mistress badly, he is also a miser.  Despite being wealthy, he never makes any repairs to the old rotting school and buys rotten food for sale and serves it to the entire school.  For that matter, few characters enlist any real sympathy.  Michel's mistress Nicole is a hard, ruthless woman, Christina is weak and submissive, and the kids are all brats.
Word has it that Hitchcock was so impressed by this film that he wanted to remake it.  Instead, the authors of the book on which this film was based wrote ""D'entre les Morts"" which Hitchcock would make into his masterpiece, ""Vertigo"".  ""Diabolique"" has a very Hitchcockian feel to it what with the story line and the direction but without the Bernard Herman score or the humor.  The film seems to have influenced Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in a lot of ways.  Certain things like the black & white cinematography, the place where the murder takes place, the way the body is disposed, the nosy private eye, and the twist ending are all highly reminicent of ""Psycho"".

Clouzot's real life wife plays the saintly long-suffering wife; the great Simone Signoret the calculating mistress, and the taut scenes and water imagery keep the story snowballing 'till that knockout ending. ""Diabolique"" demonstrates that ""art house"" and ""thriller"" need not be separate genres.",1013126400,,572,5.6395348837209305
739639,4,6303935125,"As many well know, Hitchcock and Clouzot were both trying to get the rights to the book on which DIABOLIQUE is based on and as you can see Clouzot beat out Hitch. While I think that Hitch being the master that he was could have made it better adding things here and there that Clouzot did not I believe Clouzot did a fine job with this movie. I'll skip the plot synopsis since you probably know it already. The direction is very reminiscint of Hitch and that is because even Hitchcock himself admitted to using this movie as inspiration for PSYCHO (the similarties are all to obvious). Clouzot opts to not use a musical score (with the exception of the music in the opening titles which is very scary indeed) and instead decides to try a different apporach by letting the suspense build up by the use of his direction and the performances of the actors. This works most of the time but I do believe that this movie could have benefitted greatly by having music that was as scary as the one in the opening titles or maybe a low key violen score (the opening title music seems to have inspired Herrmann as well). He uses shadows quite a lot in this movie and he empahsizes the sounds of many mundane things such as a faucet dripping or creaky floorboards which today is done to death but it was still not as common place back then but at the time it was begininng to be. the emphasis on sound gives us a feeling of the paranoia that the two ladies in this movie feel after they have committed their crime. The acting is quite naturalistic I believe on the part of Signoret as the icy mistress of the school headmaster in the movie and the same goes for Paul Meurisse as the headmaster. Vera Clouzot's performance is a bit bigger but that's probably to put more on emphasis on her character than on all the other ones. She always looks like she is on the edge of hysteria and her performance helps propell much of the movie. This film provides a very dark look at human nature at it's lowest (the wife of the headmaster is an ex-nun who takes part in a murder which for a while she seems to (understandibly) relish). All in all a pretty suspenseful movie which is more than any thing else a portrait of the dark side of human nature.",1005955200,,2230,4.350119904076738

Paul Meurisse as the loathsome headmaster is excellent, as are Vera Clouzot as his frail wife and Simone Signoret as his mistress.  The lesser roles (school staff etc) are also well taken.
As for the DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  Soundwise, don't worry about the rather constricted melodramatic music over the opening credits.  That's the last music you'll hear, and the speech driven mono soundtrack sounds fine.
From an image point of view, the transfer was better than I was expecting, after reading other reviews of this DVD.  It is correctly framed in 1.33:1, and the print used has little damage in terms of nicks or scars.  Very occasionally there are more flecks than you might want, but nothing to worry about.
The image is reasonably sharp (and improves on some of the interiors, particularly the darker scenes), although occasionally it is a little soft with a touch of grain in the daytime exteriors.  I also noticed that this slight softness coincided with Vera Clouzot being on screen, so perhaps it was deliberate on her husband the director's part.  The lighting of this film is also superb: just check out some of the night exteriors which are superbly atmospheric.
So will this film `drive you up the wall' as the film guide says?  Well, no, not really.  The twist at the end is very well done, if not too surprising to modern audiences.  There is at least one smaller twist after that, though, which will make you think.

It's power is paralyzing, it's images are haunting, and it's atmosphere is thick and merciless. The film begins and proceeds in a stately manner, with beaten, suffering wife (Vera Clouzot) plotting the death of her abusive husband (Paul Meurisse) with his mistress (Simone Signoret). All three work at a provincial boy's school, Clouzot is the rightful owner, Meurisse is the cold director, and Signoret is a teacher. The school itself is remarkably photographed, with long, dark hallways and decaying, ancient walls. After drowing him in a bathtub, the two ladies dump his body into the school swimming pool. When the pool is drained, however, the body is missing. The fear he may still be alive... and out for vengence. What follows is a carefully sculpted piece of suspense, on par with any of Hitchcock's films. The final half-an-hour of 'Diabolique' is relentless in it's terror, pushing the limitations of it's audience further and further up the cliff before kicking them, brutally and unforgiveable, off the edge. All the performances are fine, with assured direction from Henri-Georges Clouzot. Watching the film, which was made back in 1954 (6 years before Hitchcock tested the stomachs of moviegoers and censors alike with 'Psycho), i was amazed at just how advanced the French film community was in relation to the Uniter States.

739736,5,6303935125,"Director Henri-Georges Clouzot's DIABOLIQUE is one of these movies we, in french speaking countries, have seen at least a dozen times on TV in our teen days. Always with pleasure. In part, because of the terrific cast but  mainly because of the whodunit plot.
And now, a lot of years after (ten  ?), I bought the DVD right after its release. I don't know exactly why,  DIABOLIQUE being not the kind of movie you always put in your 10 best list.  Maybe it was due to Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, who appeared only in  a few movies with her spanish accent and who, in DIABOLIQUE, with her hair  nicely combed, plays a character similar to the heroins of the fairy tales  of our childhood. Or is it Simone Signoret who, with Anna Magnani and Bette  Davis, is a star whose light hasn't faded with the years passing by. Paul  Meurisse perhaps ? Or Charles Vanel, or Michel Serrault, already perfect in  a comic role ?
What I know for sure is that I can watch DIABOLIQUE again  and again without being tired of it. In my opinion, it is a classic movie  in the most noble sense of the term.
No extra-features with the movie,  sound perfect but a copy with some scratches and often grainy. Strange when  one thinks of the quality of Criterion's work on, for instance, Ingmar  Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL.
A DVD for your library.",955670400,,1325,4.4625
739737,4,6303935125,Parallels are always drawn with Psycho - but I think this brilliant movie had a much stronger influence on  Vertigo.  Also look for the similarity between Charles Vanel's detective and Peter Falk's Columbo! Criterion have  a well deserved reputation for the quality of their DVD releases.  It's a  real tragedy that we don't have companies who care as much about film  restoration on this side of the Atlantic.,951091200,,410,4.955882352941177

THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC MYSTERY AND IN THE END I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL BE REALLY SUPRISED.ACTUALLY IT IS REALLY EASY TO PREDICT THE TWIST MUCH BEFORE YOU  COME TO THE END BUT STILL THIS IS A GREAT PICTURE WITH A MARVELLOUS CAST  FROM A VERY TALENTED FRENCH DIRECTOR . THE ONLY REASON I GIVE 4 STARS TO  THIS DVD IS NOT BECAUSE THE MOVIE DESERVES IT BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF  SUPPLEMENTS.IF YOU LIKE MYSTERIES,JUST BUY IT EYES CLOSED.",950745600,,492,4.362637362637362
739739,5,6303935125,"One of the most ingenious, chilling movies EVER made. I had wanted to see this film for at least 20 years and, when I finally saw it for myself,- it truly lived up to all my expectations!! The mistress AND the wife of a sadistic schoolmaster conspire to murder the man, carry it out, and soon begin to wonder whether they covered their tracks effectively. It sounds simple, but the characters seem fearfully knowing and there are undertones of strange, tainted pleasures and punishments; plot twists and double-crosses abound. Clouzot's Grand Guignol techniques are so calculatedly grisly that they seem silly, yet they succeed in making one feel queasy and sordid and scared. French with English subtitles. Remade (ludicrously) in 1996.",948153600,,737,5.099173553719008
739740,4,6303935125,"This is a film that means to get under your skin, and it succeeds.  A man's mistress and his wife, finely portrayed by Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot, respectively, plot to murder him...but then the body disappears.  And that's only the first twist in a story as visually inventive as it is  convoluted.  Bleak and cold-blooded from the start, DIABOLIQUE takes a  slow, leisurely approach to its storytelling, but with each gradual  development lays on an extra layer of tension, then proceeds to tighten the  suspense like a screw.  The result is a genuinely disturbing final half  hour that culminates in one of the most shocking conclusions ever put on  screen.  Shot in stark black-and-white and without the benefit of a  soundtrack (which actually heightens the suspense), DIABOLIQUE exists  solely for the glee with which it executes its surprise ending, but what an  ending it is.  Anyone who gives away this devastating shocker of a  conclusion ought to be drowned in his own bathtub.",946771200,,994,4.969512195121951
739761,4,6303935125,"Great art movie by Henri-Georges Clouzot, and phenomenal performances by Signoret and Vera Clouzot.  I wished they were both 41 youngers and could have performed in the 1996 re-make.  Would have been interesting to compare  Stone to Signoret.  Unfortunately, the DVD lacks quality,  the same  sub-title appeared for about 15 minutes,  therefore if you don't speak  French, you may be a little frustrated. Good movie to watch, since it will  make you appreciate the effect technology had the last 40 years in movie  making business.  However, I would not recommend the purchase of this  movie. If you have the money to spend, buy the 1996 re-make.  Many thanks  to amazon.com for bringing this movie to me and the public.",919555200,,720,4.9411764705882355
7856725,5,6303935125,"Great movie with a great near-final sequence loaded with terrific suspense (a culmination of the suspense that ratchets up steadily throughout the entire film).  Yet, even within the terrifying tension of that scene, that ridiculously sexy see-through night gown, back-lit to delicious perfection, brings a tension all its own.  Leave it to the French to serve up a bouillabaisse of mortal terror and seductive arousal all in one killer sequence.  Plus we get the added bonus of discovering where Peter Falk obviously conceived his take on the Columbo character.  And then there is this little tidbit to up the creep factor... five years after making this movie at only 46 years, the star, Vera Clouzot, died of - you guessed it - a heart attack.  An absolute horror classic on par with the likes of Psycho.",1526256000,,807,4.904411764705882

It kept me on the edge of my seat and in spite of myself, I kept rooting for the two women carefully planning this awful murder because the man was so despicably cruel to both his wife and his mistress. The women are both beautiful but in different ways and are both superb actors. The slime-ball creep is also nice looking and terrific in his miserable roll. The actors who play the boys at the school are realistic, everyone is great in this film including the two tenants who rent from the mistress. Good plot and setting, great story.",1513987200,,576,4.548076923076923

I was immersed into it then, and was even more immersed into it now. It's just so incredible. It was so ahead of its time from the story-line itself to how it basically defined an entire genre. Most remarkable of all is how it has never aged, it's not outdated, and it still has the power to keep us at the edge of our seats, even if you've already seen it before!
