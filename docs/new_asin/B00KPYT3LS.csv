6438247,5,B00KPYT3LS,"Half the time, I'm the kind of person that thinks the original is always the best, but on very rare occasions, the sequel can surpass its predecessor. This review may contain spoilers! 22 Jump Street had bigger action and some better jokes than '21' It's a sequel that's self-aware that it's spoofing the sequel genre and talk about 're-hashing the same old stuff' It distances itself from the television series, almost like the original and brings a fresh take to the buddy cop genre.

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return as Schmidt and Jenko. 21 Jump Street has been bought back by the Koreans, so they move across the street to 22 Jump Street. This time, the duo go undercover as college students to track down the supplier of a drug called ""WHYPHY"" (WiFi) that killed a student on campus. Schmidt meets up with a girl named Maya (forget about Molly from the previous movie) while Jenko hangs out with a cool football jock named Zook, who might be involved with the drug. There are some great cameos and the ending credits are AMAZING! (Be sure to stay and watch all thru the credits) I loved this sequel, it has tons of laughs, and great exploding action! I highly recommend 22 JUMP STREET!!!",1402790400,9,1197,4.619718309859155
6438248,4,B00KPYT3LS,"Nine Things about the Movie 22 Jump Street [USA, 2014]

1. In 2012, 21 Jump Street was released, which was surprisingly funny, and kind of freshened up the buddy cop genre,

2. Heres 22 Jump Street. I was afraid this movie would fall victim to the problem that plagues comedy sequels - that the filmmakers only had enough good material for one movie, so that the sequel sucks. But this movie does not have that problem.

3. Channing Tatum returns as Jenko, and Jonah Hill returns as Schmidt, and their bromantic partnership takes them undercover at a college looking for the source of a new synthetic drug.

4. Jenko meets a football player frat guy named Zook, and they immediately hit it off. Jenkos new bromance (actually, they are lambros) causes Schmidt to feel rejected. He finds solace in dating an art major with a super bitchy roommate.

5. Honestly, there isn't a lot of thought given to the actual investigation part of the story. It doesnt make sense and it kind of just repeats the basic plot of the first movie. Its pretty worthless.

6. Luckily, nobody goes to see the Jump Street movies for the plot. The rest of the movie is hilarious. Tatum and Hill have awesome chemistry together. The humor ranges from dumb physical comedy to insightful jabs at society and modern culture.

7. The movie has no problem making fun of itself, and there are some wonderful meta-moments, where characters are speaking in the movie, but you realise that they are actually speaking *about* the movie. There are also various sly jokes in the background that are fun to find.

8. The credits are just as funny as the rest of the movie.

9. Whether you like your comedy smart, or dumb, or a mix of both, youll find something to laugh at here. This is a rare comedy that I am willing to pay for in the theater, instead of waiting for Netflix.",1402790400,6,1836,4.556231003039514
6438249,3,B00KPYT3LS,"How do you follow up a surprise hit comedy? Why, by doing the exact same thing almost scene for scene. We call this the Hangover 2 effect. Dont get me wrong, 22 Jump Street isn't a bad movie, but at the end of the day no matter how much it wants to make fun of itself, break the 4th wall, and tries to play off its laziness as just part of the joke, the fact of the matter is that this is a very lazy movie. Almost insultingly so. And no I don't think pointing this out in the film over and over and over again makes that okay. Its not that this isn't a funny movie, though clearly not as funny as the first, its that its the same movie. If youve seen 21 Jump Street then its sequel is little more than a redundant retread of old jokes, old ideas, and old plot points.

Johna Hill and Channing Tatum are once again sent under cover into school to find the supplier, infiltrate the dealers, yada yada yada, only this time they are in college. Tatum immediately strikes up a friendship with the cool kids (a frat boy, see this IS different!) while Johna Hill resents being left out and starts hanging out with the awkward outcasts, this time a bunch of art students instead of card playing NERDS!!!! Hilarity ensues, though with a bit less hilarity then the last movie. Its not that the plot is similar, its that its exactly the same. They even have the OMG we took the drug were trying to find by mistake and now were freaking out scene.  It would have been one thing had the movie made fun of itself while at the same time trailing its own path and coming into its own, but its perpetually stuck in the shadow of its much funnier predecessor.

What really saves this film is the chemistry of Johna Hill and Channing Tatum, who once again are absolutely hilarious. They work really well together and play off each others differences very well. Again, if youve seen 21 Jump Street you already know this, but this is one similarity between the two that Im glad of. Its like Seth Rogan and James Franco: whenever they get together, it just works. Combine that with a gut busting performance from Ice Cube who, thankfully, is given a greatly expanded role, and you have all the right ingredients for a very funny movie. A lot of the jokes, likewise, are actually really funny when they bother to be original. Theres one in particular involving Ice Cube, his daughter, and Johna Hill which had me rolling on the floor. So its not like this isn't a funny movie. It is. At times. This could have been a funny movie all the way through and it annoys me that they took the easy way out. When the end credits are the second funniest part of the movie, you know something went wrong.

At the end of the day 22 Jump Street isn't worth seeing in theaters even if you were a fan of the first one like me. Its definitely something you should wait to come out on video first. Good comedies have been in short supply this year unfortunately, but hey The Lego Movie comes out soon so if you want to die laughing at an extremely well made comedy just wait a few days and pick it up. As for 22 Jump Street, youll be better off waiting.",1402704000,3,3114,4.272881355932204
6438250,4,B00KPYT3LS,"Okaaaay.  It worked before, now let's milk it. At least this time our heroes are in college... With a team of writers (a total of SEVEN), co-directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, who have collaborated before (""The Lego Movie,"" ""21 Jump Street,"" and ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs""), are visiting familiar territory: Our characters work under- cover in an educational environment sullied by drug sales to youngsters. Problem is, our two heroes aren't sure if they can make the leap to adult- hood and a mature friendship, even with a certified couple's counselor!

The cast:
  * Channing Tatum (""White House Down"") Jenko thinks he has found a new soul mate, someone who thinks like him, talks like him and plays football like him.
  *  Jonah Hill (""Moneyball"") Schmidt is jealous. He doesn't like being usurped by some jock, although there is a delectable young beauty who just might do the trick, if only she wasn't the daughter of...
  * Ice Cube (""Ride Along"") Captain Dickson, who is profanely emphatic that he will NOT have his daughter dating one of his cops!
  * Amber Stevens (Lots of TV) Maya may be Captain Dickson's daughter, but she has a mind of her own. Looks like the apple didn't fall very far from THAT tree!
  * Wyatt Russell (""Cowboys & Aliens"") is Zook, the athlete who bonds with Jenko (and yes, he is the hockey-playing son of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell).

This R-rated outing starts with a brief recap of the previous movie, much like the TV show always included a recap of the previous episode. The audience really laughed at this inside joke. It has a LOT of profanity, physical humor, anatomical jokes, visits from ""21 Jump Street"" characters, and some goofy vehicular mayhem. We saw gunfights and fisticuffs, but the only blood I remember was from a shoulder wound on one of our heroes.

The screening audience was ready to enjoy this one, and they did!

To me, the tongue-in-cheek imagining of future sequels (grad school, flight school, dental school, beauty school, driver's ed, ad infinitum) during the final credits scroll, was almost funnier than the movie itself. Maybe I should consider making a set of DVDs from Amazon....",1402704000,2,2169,4.821621621621621
6438251,4,B00KPYT3LS,"A pleasant second adventure, at times even more amusing and exciting than the first.  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again prove an electrifying duo, however unexpected, and the cast has a memorable and scene-stealing new member in Jillian Bell as Mercedes, the dryly confrontational roommate of the Hill character's love interest,  a character who obviously becomes more important as the film goes on.  She lands one magnificent one-liner after another, and I hope she is cast in a Frances Ha/Obvious Child-type vehicle in the near future.  In general, I admire the way the film recognizes and plays with its own capitalist absurdity as a larger-budget variation on a prior hit, but it does become long in the tooth at two indulgent hours, threatening to blur the line separating Self-Aware Spoof of Overblown Sequels from Actual Overblown Sequel.  For gifted directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's (The Lego Movie), this is becoming an unfortunate authorial trait:  they deliver (color, flash, music, wit), but then they deliver again and again and AGAIN, until their films threaten to tip into a type of exuberant exhaustion.",1402617600,10,1138,5.191256830601093
6438252,5,B00KPYT3LS,"I usually don't give movie 5 stars but this one deserves it. If you liked the first then you must see the second one! You will laugh from start to finish.

Of course, it's not academy award winning movie. Oh hell no! If you expected to see that stuff you're seriously in the wrong place! lol  You should had already known what you're getting into based on the cover only! Now, if you expecting to see two guys doing hilarious and outrageous comedy. You won't be disappointed.

It helps if you seen the first movie because this movie is a direct sequel to the first. They used a lot of references from the first and if you saw it, then you will see those connections and it make more sense. I highly recommend you see the first before seeing this movie. Of course, if you didn't see the first, you will see have a good time. It's just that the story will mean more to you, if you saw the first.

Some people feel this movie may or may not be good in terms of seeing the same skits over again. I'm in the group that likes seeing the same things again, but in another new movie. So for me, I didn't mind it and that's what I came here for. Here's a for example, the original idea was two under-performing cops go back to high school. In this one, you see them go to college. Some people will not like this, saying oh, it's basically, the same thing. To them, I say ""why in the hell, did you even watch it then???"" That's their fault. Then, another similar skit was Jonah Hill's character felling in love with a girl in the first movie. Well, that happens again in the second, so if you didn't want to see that. ""Why you watch it then???"" All these movies have love interests and this movie is NOT an exception to it.

If you saw the first movie, you know there was a bromance between Jonah Hill's characters and Channing Tatum's character. It was one of the factors that made the movie so good. Now for this movie, they took that idea and triple fun out of it. What happens when another dude else gets involved between those two? When your partner for all these years wants to do a separate operations? When your partner wants to do a break up? When your partner doesn't want to be your partner or a cop anymore? You will find out in this movie -  hilariously.

I don't want to spoil too much for you guys, so I just will say this. This movie was just that good. Really GOOD! It's super funny! It's a must watch for people that love these kinds of movies. If they make another one, I will go see it just because this one was that just that damn good.",1402617600,23,2547,4.196319018404908

There is some Arrested Development-style humor sprinkled in, too (the meta-jokes and unexpected recycled references). For example,

The Jonah Hill character mentions early in the movie, the team has 'carte blanche' with the budget.

Near the end when everything has gone wrong for the good guys and they're out of money, the Channing Tatum character states solemnly he thought they had 'Cate Blanchett' with the budget. OMG! hahaha",1517011200,,469,5.226666666666667

While 22 Jump Street consists of these generic standards, it utilizes the existence of the 2012 prequel so well that its unfair to pick one movie superior to the other - it functions beautifully with its predecessor on levels of humor and cultural relevance. Richard Donners Lethal Weapon franchise has been revered classic for the buddy-cop genre since the 1980s. 22 Jump Street sets a new standard of the best within the genre, fully aware of an audience jaded towards ridiculous social standards and doesnt hesitate to mock them.",1514419200,,747,5.131147540983607

6438333,5,B00KPYT3LS,"Never saw the first one.  Laughed myself SILLY at this one. This movie is a cleverly written send-up of action movie sequels.  Hardly a moment is wasted.  And you as a viewer have to be on your toes to catch all the jokes, as some are fleeting and a bit subtle.

I saw it in the theaters back in 2014 and wondered if the novelty of it would wear off on a second viewing (which for me was in late 2016).  Nope.  Didn't.  It's just as funny the second time around, perhaps even more so because I was paying even closer attention.

There are some quotable lines that I don't want to spoil here, but I loved seeing Channing Tatum's character get choked up upon arriving on the school campus in an undercover capacity and telling his partner, ""I'm the first one in my family to pretend to go to college!""

Yes, this film is very ""meta"".  And is perhaps the best execution of it I've ever seen on film.  You'd figure it would be hard to sustain this level of inside humor for nearly two hours, especially since it was an extension of the exact same concept in an earlier film.  But the directors and the writers pull it off.

Even if you haven't seen the earlier film you should be able to understand and appreciate everything here.

Highly recommended.",1480118400,,1247,4.341991341991342

Perhaps my humor differs from someone else (I'm a young adult). You have to be a bit older than a kid to get some of the jokes, though. But if you're in for a good laugh, I think it's definitely something worth your time. I've re-watched this multiple times and I still laugh out loud at parts, especially one certain part near the middle (no spoilers here! :) ).",1452902400,,693,4.297709923664122

This move is pure garbage in comparison. Whereas everything was acted, said, or done with a deft ease in 21 Jump Street, everything seems forced in this movie. All that great bromantic chemistry between Jonah and Tatum had before has seemingly disappeared into the ether. Most of the jokes or gags fall flat. With the absence of adequate acting or line delivery, you get a morbidly unfunny film that is just awkward at times.

6438666,3,B00KPYT3LS,"I have never to my recollection seen the original TV show, and I didn't watch the first movie, so I didn't know what to expect from ""22 Jump Street.""  But my wife had read some promising reviews, and it sounded reasonably funny, so we watched it.  As you probably know better than I do, our heroes (I have no idea what their names are) go undercover as college students to break up a drug-dealing ring.  The movie gets a little unconventional and mostly whiny when it and a fair number of the characters assume that the heroes are gay partners, not professional partners.  It extracts a little humor from this misunderstanding.  Another source of humor--not nearly as rich a source as the writers figured--is that most of the characters are complete idiots much of the time.  We also have the old device of the protagonists playing for laughs while the villains are playing for keeps.

The plot is surprisingly coherent, and when some of the characters turn out to be not what you thought their reasons and their earlier actions and dialog actually make a fair amount of sense--to the audience, if not to the dim-witted characters.

I hate to admit it, and I can't say that I'm glad I saw the movie or that it was a good use for two hours of my time, but as long as I didn't have anything better to do at that moment it was significantly better than staring at a blank TV screen.  I gathered that some of the material would be amusing if you were familiar with some of the premises of the TV show or the first movie.  Other highlights include a memorable confrontation (which I've since mostly forgotten) between the heroes and some of the villains and one of the most original chase scenes I can recall--definitely one of the funniest.  Some of the stunt work is so over-the-top that it's a parody of many action movies, and it's a funny parody.  The most humorous and original material plays during the closing credits.  It also includes the movie's best graphics, which have very little to do with the movie and which in their brief flickers on screen are much more interesting than any of the actual movie.  You sort of have to watch the movie to appreciate it, so I guess I'd watch the movie, especially if there weren't other choices or if I was looking for something to follow a serious game of beer pong.",1428710400,,2312,4.513189448441247

6438914,4,B00KPYT3LS,"A return to the well for Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in every conceivable way, doggedly following the same formula that brought them success the first time around. Somehow, it's just as good. Maybe it's because there's nothing quite like this elsewhere on the scene, so we're just scratching that blatantly self-aware, clich-seeking itch once every couple of years and it hasn't yet worn out its welcome. At least, not entirely - the constant winks and nods do begin to grate by the end of the third act - but a heavy dose of loud, fresh, full-body laughs do a fine job of smoothing it all over. Ice Cube, in an expanded role, is especially great, shamelessly stealing scenes like a serial kleptomaniac. Of course it's not to be taken remotely seriously, even in comparison to the original, which is a good thing because the plot is a totally vacant, paper-thin wash. Does mindless comedy still have a place in today's landscape? It does in my living room.",1421884800,,958,4.708333333333333
6438915,4,B00KPYT3LS,"I never saw the television show, 21 Jump Street.  It was popular way before I was old enough to care.  My sisters liked it, I think.  When it was announced that the show was getting a big screen adaptation with Tatum and Hill in the leads, I didn't really care.  Some dumb buddy cop comedy that was going to get slaughtered with the reviews and produce a hand full of belly laughs resulting in a mediocre yet mildly entertaining trip to the movies; thats what I thought.

I didn't expect to pretty much love everything about the film.

Sure, it was stupid, but in a really clever way, and Hill and Tatum were such inspired (and surprisingly so) choices, and their chemistry was undeniable, infectious even.  Hill has always had a knack for developing believable chemistry with his co-stars (whether it be Cera, Pitt or DiCaprio), but there was something so deeply honest about the way he meshed with Tatum that it felt even more real, even more authentic.

I totally believe that these guys are major besties off screen, and thats all that matters.

With my surprise adoration of the first film in check, the idea of a sequel left me super excited and super nervous.  There were so many ways that they could have completely screwed this up, and yet they didnt.  No, this is NOT as good as the first film, but despite some snags, it knows when to recycle previous gags and scenarios for comedic effect and when to bring out something fresh, and while the same formula of jealous egos butting heads is used here (this time in a reverse order), the jokes and core themes are developed so well that it doesnt matter.

We know we saw this before, but we saw it differently.

My main issue here is merely the films running time.  Sure, it isn't that long (not quite 2 hours) and yet, it feels long.  The last segment (that Miami sequence) feels like it drags out the film, even if it does give us closure and tidies up the storylines.  It just felt like the film could have used some trimming to make it a tad brisker in parts.  For me, it just lacked a bit of that sharpness that the original had.

Still, this is one clever comedy, and nearly all the gags work well here.  The nods to the first film are obvious, but they work well in this formula.",1421884800,2,2244,4.416058394160584

6438932,4,B00KPYT3LS,"Like X-Men: Days of Future Past, 22 Jump Street is a total blast and the rare sequel that improves upon the original (this seems to be especially rare in comedies and horror films). This film understands and acknowledges the absurdity of a big-budget sequel to film based on an old and mostly forgotten television series. Like Edgar Wrights Hot Fuzz, the film is both parodic of big-budget action films, while also being an effective big-budget action film. Its self-aware and self-deprecating, poking fun at itself in very clever ways. (Deputy Chief Hardy, played by Nick Offerman from Parks and Recreation, mentions to Channing Tatum and Jonah Hills characters that they are attempting an almost identical drug bust as in the first film, except they're moving from a high school to a college, and their mission has twice the budget, in the hopes of making twice as much money.)

After films like Dear John and The Vow, I harshly dismissed Channing Tatum as another pretty boy who will fade into obscurity through the years, but hes proved me massively wrong in the last few years, and nowhere more so than here; the guy can act, and he has strong comedic chops. (His performance here goes right where Zac Efron went wrong in the disappointing Neighbors.) Tatum and Hill have great chemistry, and the film is consistently hilarious from start to finish (and I mean finish). No spoilers, but stick around through the credits and prepare for some big laughs. After making The Lego Movie earlier this year, directing duo Christopher Miller and Phil Lord have delivered another one of 2014s strongest films, and a film that ranks with A Shot in the Dark as one of the greatest sequels to a comedy ever.",1421539200,,1699,4.818493150684931

6438943,4,B00KPYT3LS,"With surprise hits like Edge of Tomorrow, Summer 2014 was also full of sequels at the cinema. And one of the very sequels was none other than 22 Jump Street.

After a drug operation gone wrong, Jenko and Schmidt find themselves back under the orders of Captain Dickson who informs them of a new drug called""Whyphy"". And as it turns out, Jenko and Schmidt are indeed headed to college.

Once again, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are fun to watch as Jenko and Schmidt in 22 Jump Street. I cannot imagine any other two men playing the characters in the movie as well as they do. Ice Cube returns as Captain Dickson and he brings even more humor in the sequel. Wyatt Russell plays Zook, a football player who happens to have much in common with Jenko, while Amber Stevens joins the cast as the artistic and (beautiful) character Maya.

The story progresses pretty well although unlike 21 Jump Street, there were a FEW instances where a joke either went too far/started out being funny then it just.....but despite those few moments, 22 Jump Street does everything a sequel should do for the most part. 22 is at its best when the duo of Tatum and Hill are onscreen reminding us of why we liked the original film in the first place.

Amidst the confirmation of another sequel, along with the rumor of a potential MEN IN BLACK/Jump Street crossover, I will say if you enjoyed 21 as much as I did, there are still a lot of laughs to be had with 22. In my opinion, 22 may not be quite as good as the predecessor but still proves to be a funny and likable sequel.  And definitely give the end credits scenes a watch, you are going to LOVE it.

A Good Experience

6439060,4,B00KPYT3LS,"A different kind of Comedy when compared to 21 Jump Street. The movie hit hard with some amazing moments but the humor wasn't as consistent as 21JS. The first movie captured realistic moments of HS and the evolution of what ""we"" knew as HS vs what the younger generation knew. The sequel disconnected from that feeling, without spoiling it a few moments reminded me of college but a lot of the action seemed unrealistic. I don't care because it was funny. The biggest surprise of the movie was by far the funniest and they did an absolutely amazing job of both setting it up and sucking every single bit of comedy out of it. It alone was worth watching the movie.

Overall it's definitely worth a watch. A plot that was stitched together poorly but enough comedy to back it up.

There were some hilarious moments, don't get me wrong, but there was a lot of incredibly stupid (not in a funny way) moments as well.

The movie plays on the ""partnership"" of the two and constantly tries to make it funny by making their conversations insinuate a romantic partnership.  In the previews, this was funny, but about halfway through the movie, I was sick of the same joke over and over.  Seriously, it seemed like 50% of the movie was the ""unintentional"" relationship/married couple play on words.  Funny once, twice, maybe three times.  20 times, just irritating at that point.  They wore the joke out and then continued to do so over and over.  Get the feeling I'm saying the same thing over and over?  Yeah, that's how the movie was.

If you watch a movie that you expect to be funny, and then think back how many times you actually LAUGHED during the movie, that is how I gauge its success.  I didn't laugh once.  I don't appreciate ""I'm stupid"" humor.  If you do (and there is nothing wrong with that--everyone should laugh as often and as hard as possible), then this is your movie at about 3.5 to 4 stars.

6439464,3,B00KPYT3LS,"It looks like we're in for a long ride with Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as numbskull police detectives.  Having graduated from high school in 2012's ""21 Jump Street,"" the boys are assigned to go undercover again, this time at the local college, MC State, in order to track down the source of a new campus drug called WHYPHY.

Once the guys are enrolled, they take different paths as they adapt to their new surroundings.  Jenko tries out for the football team and becomes a star wide-receiver.  He pals around with the quarterback, Zook (Wyatt Russell), who may be the involved in the drug distribution.  Schmidt, disillusioned by Jenko's new friendships and fraternity events, goes it alone but meets a beautiful coed named Maya (Amber Stevens) who he eventually becomes intimate with, much to the consternation of Maya's roommate, Mercedes (Jillian Bell).

For the most part, these small adventures are very amusing with both Tatum and Hill playing their roles in a low key fashion.  The funniest bits are the situations more than the banter.  Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and their writers keep things moving with the expected frivolity.  The supporting actors, especially Bell, Nick Offerman and Ice Cube get plenty of great scenes as well.  This is actually a better movie than the first.  Be sure to stick around through the closing credits as we get a hilarious preview of future ""Jump Street"" possibilities.

Blu ray lovers should appreciate this exemplary transfer from Sony.  It is encoded in 1080p and has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are bold and beautiful, especially during the exterior shots.  Black levels are deep and dark.  Skin tones are perfect.  Clarity is excellent throughout with examples prominent in facial close ups and clothing.  I could detect no abnormalities.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option in either English or French.  There is also a Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 track.  Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.  Like the video the audio is very good.  The excellent soundtrack comes through loud and clear.  Dialog is spot on and mostly centered.  Action oriented sound effects seem a bit muted for some reason.  Maybe it's just me.  Overall, can't complain.  Here are the extras:
*Five Deleted and Extended Scenes
*The Perfect Couple of Directors
*Line-O-Rama
*Audio Commentary with directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, Channing Tatum, and Jonah Hill
*Seventeen Additional Deleted and Extended Scenes
*Four Additional Line-O-Ramas
*Joke-A-Palooza
*Everything is Better in College
*Jenko Split Video
*The Perfect Line: Ad-Libbing on Set
*The Dramatic Interpretation of 22 Jump Street -- The Version Without the Jokes!

6439474,4,B00KPYT3LS,"THE FILM: Even though this is essentially the same movie as the first, there is enough meta-humor and self-awareness that you almost don't notice how derivative it is. This time Jenko and Schmidt are off to college to find the dealer/supplier for another synthetic drug (WHY-PHY) and have relationship hiccups along the way. All of the best parts of the first movie are back. There's more of Ice Cube's Captain Dickson, Jenko's non-sequiturs and Schmidt's awkward rambling. The two standout parts of the film are a brunch scene with an awesome cameo and the end credits. Still, I didn't think that it was as funny as the first one. As far as acting goes, everyone did a good job, although Channing Tatum and Ice Cube come off looking better than the rest of the cast. When it's all said and done, fans of the first one will enjoy this a lot and others need not apply.

THE EXTRAS: There are a plethora of extras which are funny to watch and add to the overall experience. The centerpiece of these is 40 minutes of deleted/extended scenes. Still, despite the sheer enormity, only a few of them were genuinely funny. There's also a couple of other featurettes which highlight some of the improvisation that into the film (which is a lot). Personally, I don't like comedies relying too much on improvisation instead of solid writing, but there was a pretty good ratio of hits to misses in terms of the jokes. There is also about 50 minutes worth of featurettes that delve into the production, and have interviews with the cast and directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller. They are truly of one mind and make an excellent team. Last, but not least, there is a feature-length directors' commentary.

OVERALL: Originality is very hard to come by these days, and as a sequel 22 JUMP STREET is very aware of that and uses that as a good source of humor. Still, there's no denying what it is: a sequel that doesn't quite live to the original. To make it a little more worthwhile, the Blu-ray has an entire movie's worth of supplements that are more interesting than the film itself in some respects. Fans of the original should get a kick out of it, and I can heartily recommend it to them.",1418342400,2,2179,4.584615384615384

6439476,4,B00KPYT3LS,"Funnier the 2nd time. There were a lot of jokes i didn't understand at first as they were either jokes about other movies the primary characters have been in or jokes about theater terminology. Watch it with someone who knows the lingo or has seen a lot of Channing Tatum movies, and of course don't bother watching it if you haven't seen the first movie. It is a very self aware movie that more or less makes fun of tropes, meta and the careers of the various actors. In that way it is hilarious but you have to be aware of the subject matter to even know its a joke.",1418342400,,568,4.172727272727273

6439492,3,B00KPYT3LS,"OK, as a 71-year old professional female, I am the wrong demographic for this film, but the reviews were so positive I thought I'd give it a try. Nothing wrong with the acting if you don't mind the main characters not even remotely acting like real cops. The bromance was cute, capturing the awkward dialogue sometimes seen in people who are dating (""I need to see other people,"" etc.). But why the crudeness? Can this generation only find humor in their genitals? Admittedly, Jonah Hill's improv scene was funny, but the non-sexual humor was outnumbered by the dildo jokes. Surprisingly, the film did make some important points, for example, giving us a little psychoeducation about the importance of not allowing one's first impression to blind one to subsequent data. This occurred in a sincere and gentle counseling session involving a case of mistaken identity, thus disproving the point. Or proving it. Anyway, my granddaughter thought it was funny, but she was probably a bit embarrassed to be watching it with her grandparents. I know I was! Maybe we need a new rating scale for humor potentially embarrassing to the gray-haired set. Or, maybe we could have scripts for young people with humor based on the many other human predicaments that do not involve sex. I'll give credit to the folks who constructed the end credits, though. Very cute! Overall, it's a sweet movie about friendships with lots of crudeness that has nothing to do with real law enforcement. If you watch it with that in mind, you'll probably enjoy it. And that Channing Tatum is certainly, um, buff!",1418169600,2,1579,4.895522388059701

6439504,4,B00KPYT3LS,"OK, so 22 Jump St. is not as funny as 21 Jump street.  This should not be a surprise, because 21 Jump St. was screaming hilarious--the rare kind of movie that had tears rolling down my cheeks and problems with gasping for breath, due to laughing so hard.  So if 22 Jump Street is ""merely"" a good comedy movie with a good helping of relationship issues, it's still a movie not to be missed by fans of comedy.

Channing Tatum, whose physique has served him well in action films, has now done quite a variety of roles and continues to be a very fine ""straight guy"" to Hill's more eccentric, neurotic and ""bariatrically challenged"" character, and these 2 movies sort of mark a whole new generation of ""cop-buddy-comedy"" films.  Yes, I hope there WILL be a 23 Jump Street!

With so many reviews already, you don't need a rehashing of the plot.  I'll just mention a few things that struck me about the sequel:
Ice Cube continues to be incredibly funny as their boss, and though he doesn't have a whole lot of screen time, when he's on screen he's a scene stealer.  From his comparison of ""Vietnamese Jesus"" at 22 Jump St. to ""Korean Jesus"" at 21, it's ON, and non-stop.
Jillian Bell, who also has limited screen time, also does a fantastic job as Maya's roommate.
Amber Stevens, who plays Maya and Jonah Hill's romantic interest, is charming and beautiful.  I couldn't really concentrate on the acting, with that face on the screen...

I don't watch too many movies twice.  I watched this a second time and found myself laughing out loud, and noticing additional details, the second time.

Jonah, whose comedy career in my opinion started out very wobbly, has gotten better and better and better with time.  May he not lose the force!

Yes, the drug scene was funny.  This new drug, supposedly like crossing Adderall with Ecstasy, makes you ""concentrate incredibly hard for about 4 hours, then party like it's G-D 1999!""  The portrayal of their inadvertent ingestion is almost as funny as the similar scene in 21 Jump.",1418169600,,2012,4.6440677966101696

6439640,2,B00KPYT3LS,"There are many who hold to the theory that a sequel to any hit movie is bound to be bad. It never quite captures the same magic that the first film had, just doesnt quite hit the right notes here and there. Of course there have been some exceptions to the rule and many great second films in various series. Unfortunately 22 JUMP STREET isn't one of those. This is not to say there aren't any laughs in this film but with the expectations set by the first movie there should be more.

Undercover officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) have remained on the job but have had little success since their high school case. In an effort to duplicate their success the police department assigns them once again to the Jump Street program, now moved across the street to the 22 address. With a bigger budget thanks to their earlier success Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) has a better office, better equipment and better men. Now he has these two again.

To recreate that earlier success they're going back to school again, this time to college. The case involves a new drug on the market that has claimed the life of one young female college student. Its up to Schmidt and Jenko to find out who is dealing this new drug and get it off the market before it becomes wide spread.

The other students immediately notice the age difference of the two with the rest of the students. Why they notice more now than in the first film is anyones guess. As the duo dig deeper into college life they take two different paths. Schmidt begins dating an attractive young woman who lived across the hall from the drugs first victim. This sets up one of the funniest jokes involving a reaction from Jenko, but a joke that is readily apparent to most making it lose the humor involved.

Jenko goes another route much like the first film, enjoying the college lifestyle and becoming friends with a quarterback on the football team when he tries out. The two hit is off as if they were separated at birth and their combined efforts make the team a winning one. Brought into his fraternity Jenko begrudgingly continues to investigate them as suspects but overlooks what should be clues based on his all too growing friendship. At the same time his partnership with Schmidt dwindles to almost nothing and the two part ways to do their own investigations.

Obviously this parting of the ways will be solved, the team will get back together and the bad guy will be found and apprehended. What made the first movie works was the ease with which the two leads played off of one another. That happens here but not near as often. On top of that many jokes that are bad here have a tendency to play out far too long, as if no one was there to say enough already. Thats become a major problem with comedies these days, especially from successful actors riding a wave from a previous hit. They suddenly become untouchable and no one dares tell the emperor that hes not wearing any clothes. NEIGHBORS was the same way.

Tighter writing and direction might have saved this one but as it stands its only a decent comedy rather than a great one. Instead we get a lame story with far too many of those moments, jokes that play out and take up too much time where better jokes could have been. While the parting of the two leads may have worked for the story it doesnt as far as the end result for the movie goes. I doubt that this film will crash the careers of anyone involved. There are at least 4 good laughs in it but thats about it in my opinion. But with the popularity of the first film Im sure it will do great rentals and with the Christmas season near solid sales as well. I also think youll see plenty of copies turn up at the local used DVD store come January.",1417564800,,3742,4.431686046511628

6439691,3,B00KPYT3LS,"Well, they usually say that the follow-up never compares to the original or the first. That happens to be the case with this movie too. I like seeing the main character in the coach from the last movie. The dark-haired boy that sold drugs in the coach are now in jail to gather and are sharing a cell. There is a funny scene between the two cops and those two characters. They young dark-haired boy from the first movie has sarcastic biting wit..The guy that played the coach I guess he was funny.
The movie had some jokes but I guess it just lost a lot of its pizzazz & that kind of disappoints me. There was a glaringly obvious sign pointing towards a 23 Jump St. that too will be a movie that I stream because I will not waste movie theater money for this series.
This is the type of movie that I wait for it to come on cable and then I will watch it late at night is I am going to bed or on one of those days where you were stuck in the house because of really bad weather or because you're sick or something. You know when you don't really want to focus on a movie but it's just on for background noise and sometimes you'll hear something that makes you laugh?

Fortunately for us, this movie has not suffered from the curse of sequels and is actually as enjoyable as the first one. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill has such unexpectedly great chemistry, it is a joy to see them working together again.

The story line was a little out-there the first time around, so you know what to expect for the sequel. However, this is not the kind of movie to watch if you enjoy picking apart story lines.

6440015,4,B00KPYT3LS,"Hollywood long ago recognized that there was gold to be mined from sequels to popular movies. In fact, many sequels have surpassed the originals in box office dollars. The difficulty with sequels has always been to give the viewer what he enjoyed in the first movie while skewing the story just enough to make it seem like something new rather than a rehash.

In ""22 Jump Street,"" directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""21 Jump Street,"" ""The Lego Movie"") play with that conundrum with lots of inside jokes and dialogue that work not only to establish and move the plot ahead but also to comment on the requisites of making a sequel.

Cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are given a new assignment by Captain Dickson (Ice Cube): go undercover at a local college where a new designer drug has been making the rounds and is responsible for the death of a student. Their object: find the distributor and make an arrest. Sound familiar? It's essentially the same plot as ""21 Jump Street"" only set on a college campus instead of a high school. The twist is that their brotherly relationship is threatened when Jenko develops a man- crush on quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell). When Jenko suggests that he and Schmidt go their separate ways in the investigation, Schmidt is hurt and a very funny break-up scene satirizes the typical boy-girl breakup so common in traditional romantic pictures.

That is one of the cleverest bits in a script filled with goofiness, plays-on-words, improvisation, action sequences, and even a surreal dream sequence. The directors toy with gender relationships without sacrificing laughs. As we watch the relationship between Jenko and Zook develop, for example, we might just be watching the ""meet cute"" scene in a boy-girl flick. However, the movie never slips into anything other than a buddy-type relationship between Jenko and Zook. When an unpleasant epithet is used at one point to refer to gay men, Jenko shifts gears from dim-bulb goofball to rights activist as he gives a speech about the inappropriateness of such terms in the modern world. We laugh because it's so out of character for Jenko, but the message is genuinely felt.

While Jenko is hanging out with Zook, Schmidt is cozying up to lovely Maya (Amber Stevens), an undergrad who knew the deceased student.

Finding the drug dealer is secondary to the hijinks until the final third of the film, which is a highlight, as the actual drug dealer is revealed and lots of mayhem ensues.

The team of Hill and Tatum is movie magic. They work together effortlessly and look as if they're having a grand old time. Hill is more into improvisation than Tatum, who knows to just go with the flow. His dumbfounded look is as much a comic trademark as Chaplin's derby and cane or John Wayne's Stetson. Hill manages to convey intelligence as well as deliver in the gag department, so you feel he just might be the right cop to ferret out a drug dealer, though his methods may not be by the book. The scenes in which Hill and Tatum are apart are the weakest. Together, they are a terrific comedy team.

Rated R for strong language, ""22 Jump Street"" will elicit plenty of laughs, which might keep you from realizing you're watching pretty much the same movie as its predecessor.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include five deleted and extended scenes, director and actor commentary, digital HD copy, and several behind-the-scenes featurettes, one of which addresses the art of improvisation on the set.",1416787200,,3514,4.854757929883139

Rather, we watch movies like 22 Jump Street to be entertained and for some sheer escapist romp.  Jonah Hill is hilarious in the movie, and Channing Tatum is very likable.

Hill and Tatum are a funny duo together as their comedy chemistry is pretty good and leads to some awkwardly funny moments.

The first movie was a 5-star movie.  This one is about 1.5 stars, mainly because I like Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.  The first film was funny, cute, sometimes a little touching, and relatively clean.  This one is an endless string of F-bombs, is not funny at all, and struck me as kind of creepy.  I realize that it's hard to recapture the magic of the first film when you do a sequel, but this one is a total miss.  If I didn't like the stars so much, it would have been 0 stars.

Strongly suggest buying this or at least renting it.  It isn't going to change your life, but it will make it more enjoyable.

Great production value, great video quality, acting was spot-on, and you won't miss much by not having seen the first one (though I would suggest watching it first as it is similarly a hilarious film).

Note about me:  I don't typically like the Seth Rogan/Jonah Hill gang movies.  They are pretty hit or miss for me, but I loved 22 Jump Street.",1416268800,,717,4.827868852459017

It took a long while for much to happen at all in this movie, I remember looking at the DVD's clock at the 30 minute mark and thinking, gee when's the action and comedy parts of the plot going to kick in. It does have the odd good scene, the best is an awkward situation between Ice Cube and Hill's characters. The roommate of Schmidt's (Hill's) love interest has some great lines constantly calling him out on definitely not being a teenager as he's pretending to be with constant witty lines pointing out he's old. In fact if you buy a DVD version with extras there's one with a heap of lines from her that didn't make the film.  They should have included them though, as they were a lot funnier than the rest of the film. The end credits are quite well done as well with previews of 23 Jump Street and a heap more sequels to follow that make fun of the whole tired sequel cashing in for money concept, including one of the actors not continuing on, and at times parody other cop buddy movies.  The credits thing was really well done, it's a shame that effort wasn't put into the whole film.  The main plot driven by the two cop buddies really simply fell flat. If Jenko (Tatum) had a funny line or situation in this one, I can't recall it. Wait until 22 Jump Street is on TV or somewhere else you can see it for free.",1416182400,,1415,4.24907063197026

They are tasked with finding the dealer that is giving drugs to students before the drug goes viral. They go undercover as students in order to find out who is dealing. Soon after starting school girls and friends start to effect the partnership and threaten the case. The biggest problem with sequels is that they try and do the same thing as the original but they change just enough so its not as good as the original. While that did happen with this one I have to admit that one of the best parts is that they don't try to hide from it. The movie opens in the chiefs office where he explains that because of the success of the first time they teamed up they are doing it again. A very literal reference to the first movie and he goes on to explain that what is going to happen in this one is the exact same thing as the first one. For some reason that made the repetition not bug me at all. As for the rest of the movie though I was a little disappointed. I thought the first one was better, but again sequels are never really as good. There are some definite funny parts in this and I did laugh a lot throughout but this one felt a little more flat then the original. Overall, a movie that was funny but not as good as the first one.

6440182,4,B00KPYT3LS,"I have to admit, I had my doubts about this movie after reading reviews of it.  However, when I bought it, I was desperate for a movie, and there was nothing else I wanted to watch, so my expectations weren't huge going in.

That being said, the movie exceeded my expectations.  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, as usual, were quite funny, as well as the other characters in the movie (especially the ""roommate"" of the main female character).  What stood out to me the most was the abundance of unexpected, subtle, witty lines--more so than 21 Jump Street, it seemed.  There were so many times when I had to rewind the movie just to hear the lines because they were easy to miss.

Despite the movie's humor, there was something a little unsatisfying about the plot.  It was deeply focused on the relationship between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's characters, and didn't seem to have as much ""detective work"" as the first movie.  So I was left feeling a little bit like something was missing.  That being said, overall, I really enjoyed the movie.  (It's clearly not everyone's cup of tea, though.  For a different perspective, my wife is still a little annoyed that we spent $17.99, and when I just asked her what she felt about the movie, she said ""the best jokes are in the previews.""

6440222,2,B00KPYT3LS,"This movie was about 75% as good as the first one. However, this is probably the best movie I've ever given two stars to. I really don't  mean it in a malicious way. It's just so hard when they make a sequel, and they run the high risk of being a vehicle for just making more money. It fell into all the traps that a sequel can fall into. The one liners were about 75% as funny as the first, and that is what I'm judging the movie on, as the most important part. That's actually pretty good. However, the movie just became really tiresome, as they repeatedly and repeatedly made jokes about this movie being just like the first. It felt like being on a date with someone, and they just keep pointing out how badly dressed they are.

This movie doesn't really get down to business and just get to be that funny. It's weird: maybe a few of the jokes were as good as the first movie, but everyone, including the writers were self conscious about the movie being tired. Maybe the jokes weren't as good because I had seen this idea before. In any event, the movie failed to be as good or better than the first. I won't say that it totally fell flat, but it just wasn't that exciting. The action story didn't make up for the humor, and what you were left with was a pretty good comedy, but the first was great, and I couldn't help but judge it against the first. A lot of the vibe carries over. However good this movie may have been, I really don't want to watch it again. I was kind of rolling my eyes when they did a montage at the end listing fake sequels for this movie. If they can't find fresh and new writers, I'd say the franchise is dead.

6440244,5,B00KPYT3LS,"This film is very similar to the original, so it'd be stunning for someone to say they like one and not the other. That said, this new movie is another classic.

As the first one happily deconstructed cliches involved with buddy-cop, high-school and action-comedy movies, this new version similarly pokes fun at the ideas of college, partying, and sequels. Most sequels fail because the creators simply rehash the same tricks as the first one, particularly comedies. But this movie evolves the first's premise while also lampooning it. The almost cartoonish film (this is from the same directors as The Lego Movie and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) has a plethora of silly jokes, kooky montages, screwball cameos, foul-mouthed language, and zany pratfalls. The action scenes pop with good stunts and FX too. But again, the juiciest fun is simply the killer chemistry between the two leads, who are constantly bouncing jokes off one another in their goofy prattle. At its core, this franchise is about two morons trying to be cool. Be it high school or now college, they continue to fail, and their schtick simply does not get old.

Another pleasant surprise is the lack of any big, traditional romantic interest to slog down the plot. Instead of wasting time with some mushy nonsense about true love, the movie focuses on the jokes, while substituting a wacky bromance subplot about how the boys aren't getting along as partners. Again, another clever twist on a tired formula.

As an added bonus, this film has perhaps the greatest end-credits sequence of all time. While I still think the perfection of the first movie is unparalleled, this film is still one of the best modern R-rated comedies around the greatest comedy sequel ever.",1412553600,5,1740,4.9520547945205475
6440245,4,B00KPYT3LS,"22 Jump Street
 A comedy should be funny and this R rated laugh fest wears that moniker with pride.  Within the first 10 minutes or so we get a big laugh and the funny bits and funny lines keep on coming right up to and through the credits.  And be sure to watch the credits.
 Self conscious mockery can be a very dangerous technique in films.  Many said (at the time) that The Last Action Hero used the same method to deconstruct the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  No chance of that happening here, even though we get a film reference-especially to 21 Jump Street- or an oblique actor reference every few minutes.  What might be pretentious or just stupid comes off as funny, thanks to the smooth writing, deft direction and skillful well-timed delivery by the actors.  All in all, it is a superior product and good for many laughs on a hot summer day.
 As Ice Cube says many times in the film, it is exactly like 21 Jump Street and why not?  The successful predecessor brought in over $200 million and made everyone involved a nice tidy sum to pack away for a rainy day.  The sequel should be at least as successful.
 Ice Cube again plays the police captain who must work with the hard to manage duo of undercover cops Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.  The pair stumbles through an on campus drug crime investigation.  Good looking, viscerally athletic Tatum provides the brawn to the team; the somewhat cleverer Hill brings what passes for the brains.  They have a continuing and surprisingly successful joke line that treats the lifelong pals as if they were troubled lovers.
 A truly appealing actress, Amber Stevens, plays the romantic interest to the Hill character as well as the comically entangled daughter of the perpetually angry Mr. Cube.  She had small roles in The Amazing Spiderman of 2012 and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.  She has gorgeous eyes and a strong on screen presence and we hope to see her again.  Note-this film is properly rated with a big fat R for language but the love scene between Hill and Stevens ends the morning after with them still more or less dressed.  No skin showing, in other words.  The film has bad words but no naked stuff to worry about.
 Anna Farris appears briefly in the credits, another reason to watch them to the end.  Also featured in a supporting role is Wyatt Russell, the son of famous actor Kirk Russell.
 Multiple personalities feature in both the writing and the directing.  Michael Bacall, Rodney Rothman and Oren Uziel collaborated on the screenplay.  Bacall also penned 21 Jump Street and the very imaginative Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.  Rothman writes mostly for TV and Uziel seems like an up and comer with little to show so far.  But 22 Jump Street is a good start in the big time.
 Bacall and Jonah Hill worked together on the original story.
 Phil Lord and Chris Miller co-directed the film as they did 21 Jump Street.  They also worked together on the very successful animated films The Lego Movie and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  It is unusual to have co-directors but not unheard of.  These guys have the knack.
 Hill and Tatum have proven themselves in a range of genres in filmdom.  Hill has two Oscar nominations (Moneyball and Wolf of Wall Street) to his credit, both of which are for serious dramas.  He is best known for his comedies like Knocked Up and Superbad.  This is his third film this year after voice work on The Lego Movie and How to Tame Your Dragon 2.  Tatum does comedy but also romantic leads like The Vow, dramas like Magic Mike and big special effects nonsense flicks like his two G. I. Joe films.  Both these guys are now versatile pros.
 To attest to their versatility, they both are among the producers as are the directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller.
 Made on a budget of $66 million this three and a half saw blade comedy lasts for one hour and 52 minutes.  It should do well with the many viewers that saw the first Jump movie.  Hill and Tatum should also do well.  They reportedly made an arrangement to participate in the profits on the film.  Both of them are out on the circuit promoting the film as hard as they can.",1412380800,2,4142,4.530364372469635

Went to see this in theaters with my buddy Matt, who thought it would be cooool, and it was a complete waste of life. I'm usually a fan of Jonah and his companion actors but this was obviously a farce movie done only to fulfill a market for ignorant and impetuous adolescents. Do not buy or rent this. It will suck the intelligence right out of your head and make you feel lower than when you were a teenager trying to understand why people were doing the stupid crap that they were doing. Also, an equally unfair representation of college life, at least for anyone that is trying to get an actual degree that is worth something post graduation. Please, please please do not waste your time on this if you have any sense of self respect and would like to keep that little fire of pride. just don't do it. There are other crappy movies that are much more beneficial to you and your loved ones.

This is movie suicide, don't do it. There are plenty of others who have made crappy movies and care much much more about how you feel about their movie.

6440258,3,B00KPYT3LS,"Every summer Hollywood releases a number of sequels. Long story short, because of the built-in name recognition, despite the increased cost, studios feel like sequels are safer bets and usually earn a significant amount of their costs back.

22 Jump Street starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum picks up where the original left off, with Schmidt and Jenko (Hill & Tatum respectively) being sent to college to investigate a new drug called WHYPHY.

The main point of this sequel seems to be making fun of sequels, the increased cost, lack of creativity, the repetition. It is this type of self-aware humor that made the first film as much fun as it is. In the original, the jokes were directed at the recent spate of television to film adaptations. The original is no classic, but it is funny. In this sequel, all of the humor derives from the fact they are making a sequel. And this is enough to fuel a good portion of the film.

After a brief opening segment, Schmidt and Jenko are called in to see Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) who openly derides sequels before sending them to the new headquarters at 22 Jump Street. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) gives them a tour of the state-of-the-art facility, gleefully pointing out all of the expensive equipment that they will never use. Dickson sends them to the local college, to find the source of WHYPHY. Once they get to the campus, they begin to go to class and try to find out some information by pretending to be students. But the actual students seem less accepting and quickly peg the two undercover cops for what they are. Jenkins meets Zook (Wyatt Russell), a carbon copy who is on the football team and head of the most popular frat. Sensing a kindred spirit, Zook urges Jenkins to join both. Schmidt meets Maya (Amber Stevens), the former roommate of the student who died taking the drug. They begin a relationship and Schmidt has to deal with her new roommate, Mercedes (Jillian Bell), whose caustic attitude constantly puts a kink in Schmidts plans. As they begin to get comfortable living the life they never had, they also have to figure out who is distributing this deadly drug. The actual investigation seems to become more of a nuisance.

You will realize by this point that this film is pretty much exactly the same as 21 prompting you to look for something else, to hold your attention, anything new and exciting. And when you don't find it, this becomes a problem. It seems like they put all of their energy into the self-referential jokes and didn't really care about making anything about the actual story different. This may have been the plan all along. If you think about it, most episodes of a television show are very similar, with character names and place names changed. Perhaps, they are going for this type of feel. It is a cute idea, but it doesnt work. There is something missing, something to catch and hold our attention.

Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (The LEGO Movie, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 1 & 2, 21 Jump Street) and written by Jonah Hill and three others, this sequel is similar to their other works. The jokes come fast and furious as they seem to throw anything and everything at us. Some of these jokes work, some dont. The jokes that do work are usually pretty good, helping us coast through the bits that dont. In 22, the jokes are too self-referential and little new is brought to the project.

6440262,4,B00KPYT3LS,"First I have to say what kind of Jump Street fan I am. I've never seen the original TV show, not 1 episode of it, 1st time seeing anything related to Jump Street was the 21 Jump Street movie which I LOVED! Hilarious movie, one of my favs, so I was very very excited to see this sequel to it. It had a lot of funny scenes like the 1st one did, the boys get to go on another drug trip on the new drug WHYPHY at the college they are undercover at - Channing Tatum gets to be the popular football jock at frat parties this time (but it takes away all of the hilarious awkward scenes we got to see with them in flipped roles in the 1st one ""are you 2 strapping dude?""), and Jonah Hill doesn't fit in with anyone at school. Didn't feel like they were with each other much (argued a lot when they were so missed joke opportunities), what made the 1st one the best was how they were with each other, they were comedy gold playing off each other and it actually felt like they really were close brothers through the whole thing, not so much in this one. And Tatum wasn't the confused funny ""dumb"" guy, he was a lot more serious in this one. Watching him in it was more like watching him in one of his action movies  (I know he wants to get away from the stereotype image to get different movie roles in Hollywood, but he was hilarious at it in the 1st one!!!)  Last complaint, it went on way too long (2 hrs - which would've been really great if it hadn't felt that long or had been consistently funny like the 1st one was), apparently the directors of the film were busy with The Lego Movie at the same time and didn't do any script revisions before filming which unfortunately shows in some scenes that drag on too long aka ""Jonah Hill and a crazy chick punching scene."" They did bring some old faces back from the 1st movie though, Brad's 3 ""geek"" friends who helped him hack a phone, Coach & Eric get a visit in prison, Ice Cube has more of a role, in a hilarious situation too, no spoiler alert here... and the other Jump Street crew (no Johnny Depp or original Jump Street cameos in this one though, but prob since they died in the 1st one...) I won't spoil any of the jokes for you here but trust me, there are a lot of them, great movie, different than the first, but still good, definitely worth watching if you enjoy comedies, loved the 1st one, Jonah Hill (one of my fav top 3 comedians), or seeing Channing Tatum in anything!",1404432000,2,2428,4.163829787234042

6440264,5,B00KPYT3LS,I absolutely love this movie!!!! I loved 21 Jump Street when it came out two years ago in 2012; but I honestly and truthfully have to say that I enjoyed 22 Jump Street even more than 21 Jump Street!!! Think 22's story-line; plot; comedy; and action; and characters such as Mercedes the room-mate; and Maya Jonah Hill's love interest were all better in the 22 movie or the sequel to 21:)!!! Anyone else agree with me? Got a quick question for anyone out there who is willing to answer that has to do with the music soundtrack: When is the awesome track 4 called Wasted played in the movie? And when is the totally awesome track 6 Models and Bottles played in the movie? I also luv. the two songs played at the end of the film the 22 Jump Street original theme from the motion picture; and the Live Forever songs. Aware that this is not the right place to write a review about the motion picture soundtrack; motion picture soundtrack was good also!!! Movie 22 Jump Street is so awesome--- Two Big Thumbs Up for this film for myself!!!,1404259200,9,1032,4.408376963350785
6440265,3,B00KPYT3LS,"Hollywood has a problem with sequels, especially when it comes to comedy. The second a film makes any kind of profit, whether it be 20 million or 200, studios automatically feel the need to make a follow up. And thats understandable (they need to make money) but what they usually cant get through their heads is that they almost never work. The actors generally tend to phone-in their performances and it always seems like a recreation of something much better, the original. But every now and then, once in a blue moon, a sequel comes along that isn't total trash. And luckily enough, we have 22 Jump Street to prove it.

The new film continues the story (or what some may call bromance) of Schmidt and Jenko, two undercover police officers who after re-living high school and busting a drug operation must do the same at college. But after Jenko meets a new friend on the football team and Schmidt feels left out, they begin to question their partnership.

Poking fun at the fact that the story is almost identical to the first and certainly aware of the cliches associated with sequels, its a hilarious thrill-ride that will please fans of 21 Jump Street. But as funny as it is, Im not sure I would hold it above other recent comedies like Neighbors and This is the End. It definitely had its moments but unlike the other flicks that I mentioned, I found myself forgetting much of the movie once it was over. Rated R for language and sexual content, 22 Jump Street is funny but forgettable.",1403827200,,1494,4.591760299625468
6440266,4,B00KPYT3LS,"Comedy sequels are notorious for essentially being their first movie for a second time and not bringing anything new to the table. Since this criticism has become a consensus, comedy-sequel writers have tried and failed to avoid this problem. It kind of just is what it is. Nothing is as good the second time around.

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum made for an unlikely duo in 2012s 21 Jump Street, a remake of the 1987 television series. This odd couple had great chemistry, and made for a good, if unoriginal buddy cop movie.

Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are cops who did a great undercover operation a few years ago, where they went undercover as high school students to stop a new and lethal drug from getting into the wrong hands. Now, they are going undercover at a local college to basically do the same operation all over again.

What makes this different from other basically-the-same-movie comedy sequels is its meta self-awareness. We know that its the same story as the original, and it knows that it is. What pushes this into uncharted territory is that it knows that we know it. The script is stuffed with self-aware jokes that went over the heads of alot of people in my screening - it was like I was the only one who got these jokes.

Channing Tatum, who is a complete failure as a dramatic actor, can be very good in a comedy if the script is there. He and Jonah Hill play off one another very well, and this film becomes the odd comedy sequel that demands to be watched along with its predecessor - its not a step down from the original, and its just as much fun as the first.

Quick and simple, this was a decently funny movie.  Really just what you'd expect.  It is a sequel and the film makers waste no time rubbing that in your face.  One of the first scenes (and a recurring theme throughout) has a character saying ""Do the exact same thing as last time"" over and over.  And that's what this is.  It's not deep or meaty and doesn't have some hidden meaning or AHA moment, but that's ok.  This movie is exactly what it tries to be and is pretty good at it.

Good for a night after a long day at work when your brain is fried and you can't possibly do any more thinking. I definitely thought the first was funnier, but certainly laughed plenty in this one.  If you liked the first, see it.",1403568000,3,772,4.197278911564626

After taking orders from their yin-yang, they make the same film.

Yes, they made the same movie twice. The humor was silly, inane, yet at the same time clever such as a silly chase scene taking place in front of ""The Benjamin Hill Center for Film Studies."" Anyone not hip to Benny Hill, might miss the real joke looking at a chase scene that is otherwise unappealing.

At one point our undercover guys act like a couple breaking up ""Maybe we should start investigating other people.""  Tatum has met a meat head football player who thinks identical to him, leaving Jonah Hill as the third wheel.

The film had a number of good one liners, such as ""I don't know if I like you sober."" The scenes worked fairly well, building upon each other.

Remember they made a comedy movie based on that TV show, which launched Johnny Depps career, about undercover cops infiltrating a high school? This is the sequel paying homage to all sequels. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are back and they're off to college to do exactly the same mission they had to do in the first movie.

What did I think?

The movie plays to sequel tropes and works best with its self-aware humor. When it works it works but, with Hill and Tatum bickering about their friendship it quickly falls into the same rut every Judd Apatow bro-love styled movie seems to. The humor and pacing are solid and its much more enjoyable than the first outing.

6440272,2,B00KPYT3LS,"Schmidt and Jenko have returned from their 2012 hit ""21 Jump Street"" and they just moved one street over to ""22 Jump Street"". There isn't much different on 22 Jump Street, in fact, it's just right across the street and instead of our two goofballs going back to high school, they are going off to college. They make no apologies for their `movie-in-a-can' type delivery, but maybe they should have.

If you didn't like ""21 Jump Street"", it is safe to say, you will hate ""22 Jump Street"". It is the same movie in a different location. Our undercover drug enforcement cops are still terrible cops and they once again deal with popularity separation, just like in the first movie, they once again are tracking down a dealer with a new drug and they once again, accidentally take some of said drug and go off into trippy-land. In fact, the creators know that they are making the same movie and they actually used the credits to tell the audience if they are fool enough to keep giving them their money, they can expect ""23 Jump Street: Med School"" and a slew of other situational `movie-in-in-a-can' movies.

There are some pretty hysterical moments in ""22 Jump Street"" but at one point, something so ridiculous happened that I needed to be reminded that the movie was funny and it never happened. One of those college mascot golf carts was being used in a high speed chase with a Humvee and they were firing shots and driving all over town like it was destruction city, despite the fact that the bad guys certainly didn't want to be discovered and the entire thing ended with the mascot cart hitting a football goal post and exploding. From that point on, the comedy was lazy, tactless and stupid.

""22 Jump Street"" is not without its merits. I did find some of the comedy in the early parts of the film very effective and Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have an amazing rapport with each other, but the screenplay was about as complicated as counting to four and it took 7 writers to do that; it's that simple. To make matters worse, every time our heroes stumbled across the bad guys they would just walk up and say, ""Stop. We're the police.""  After about the third time doing this, I was actually hoping that they would be shot to death and they would roll the credits. I like funny, but I don't like stupid.

I can have fun with most movies but one thing I really don't like is laziness and everything from beginning to end in ""22 Jump Street"" can be defined with laziness. This is easy money for Hollywood and these seven writers are laughing all the way to the bank. The script could have been written in a day and by anybody. We should demand better from our movies, but unfortunately this is what people are paying to see and outstanding movies with great screenplays, original stories and more effective humor like ""Edge of Tomorrow"" get disappointing results. You want more stupid movies with lazy sequels, than this is your cup of tea. Not mine.",1402876800,4,2951,4.549905838041432
6440273,4,B00KPYT3LS,"There's a running gag throughout Phil Lord and Chris Miller's hilarious 22 Jump Street that it's basically your typical sequel, ripping off the same old jokes and situations while just making things bigger. The more Meta the film gets the funnier it is, and the truth is that they aren't really lying. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are back as best buds and keystone coppers Jenko and Schmidt; they're busting up another student-run drug ring; and the same polarizing forces that broke the duo up the last time are again in effect. But you know what? You'll be laughing too damn hard to care that sometimes 22 Jump Street feels a little familiar, especially since that is kind of the point.

What Lord and Miller have done is up the ante on a follow-up nobody thought would ever happen. The ""inside joke"" of 21 Jump Street was that it was always sort of destined to fail being a remake of a silly TV show few actually watched. So 22 Jump Street cuts loose and indulges in the bombastic and formulaic nature of movie sequels, dutifully ripped through the welcome return of Nick Offerman's deadpan police sergeant. He tasks Jenko and Schmidt to basically do the exact same thing as before, shipping them off across the street to 22 Jump Street where the unit has taken up shop at the bigger, gaudier Vietnam Church appropriately described as something Iron Man would love.

When the perpetually angry and arguably even angrier Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube) ships them off to college to find the supplier of a new designer drug, Jenko and Schmidt are thrust into a campus life they are ill-equipped to handle. Not only aren't they fooling anybody because of their obvious advanced age, but they begin to feel the pull of the social pecking order. Jenko joins the football team and becomes friends with Zook (Wyatt Russell, a dead ringer for his father Kurt), the squad's QB and potential suspect in the case. Meanwhile, Schmidt is feeling left out until he hooks up...in more ways than one...with brainy art student Maya (Amber Stevens) who brings him more trouble than expected.

And it's to Lord and Miller's credit, along with the trio of screenwriters, that for all the intentional riffs on what came before, there is still plenty left to be discovered. So yes, we get the token ""bad drug trip"" scene, which is still pretty funny when those are usually phoned in, and the plenty of Michael Bay-inspired action sequences. But we also get a lot more of Ice Cube as Dickson is woven into the plot in a way that powers the humor for the entire second half. There are so many jokes that a second or third viewing will be necessary to catch them all and even then it may not be enough.

Say what you want about Channing Tatum but he'll do literally anything he's asked to do comedically. While he still has great chemistry with Hill, who continue to seem like the bestest buds ever, Tatum shoulders much of the physical and emotional burden here. We've seen this same ""falling for a girl out of his league"" storyline for Schmidt before, but Jenko is finally in a place where he is truly comfortable and not a fish out of water. It causes some interesting friction between the two partners that is played up nicely for a while, but then becomes just an endless stream of tiresome homoerotic jokes. With all of the trouble Hill has had with the LGBT community lately the frequent use of gay humor seems misplaced, and certainly isn't edgy. More than just Hill, Tatum, and Cube get in on the fun. The supporting cast never lets us down, and we may be looking at a Rebel Wilson-style breakout from Workaholics star Jillian Bell as Maya's grumpy roommate.

You'll want to stick around throughout the awesome credits teasing an increasingly ridiculous string of sequels (2121 Jump Street? It's a thing.) that you'll really want to see happen. Whether Jenko and Schmidt eventually head to 23 Jump Street (hey, it's right next door!) we'll find out soon enough, but for now 22 Jump Street is a sequel that lives up to an incredibly high standard.",1402876800,68,4028,4.6596343178621655
