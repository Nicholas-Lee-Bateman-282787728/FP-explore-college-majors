8375741,4,B002O0G2SS,Bought for my fiancee as a Christmas gift. Excited to give him yet another great DVD to add to his ever-growing UFC collection. A+ for Seller. Thank you!,1387065600,,153,4.5
8375742,5,B002O0G2SS,The fight card was stacked with fast ferocious fights and early finishes. Two great champions closed out the event with an epic main event.,1368057600,,139,4.833333333333333
8375743,1,B002O0G2SS,I got disc 2 that's it so I never got to see the main card it was a complete and udder ripe off and I can't get my money back it sucks,1347321600,,134,3.21875
8375744,4,B002O0G2SS,"But it's still definitely a decent card, especially since I got it for $2. A lot of this event was just plain hard to watch; you probably will see fewer crotch shots on a season of Jackass. Yes, that's an exaggeration, but you feel every hit, especially the awful one in Gonzaga/Tuchscherer. The fight card is:
Marcus Aurelio/Evan Dunham-5/5
Nick Catone/Mark Munoz-4/5
Tim Hague/Todd Duffee-5/5
Justin McCully/Mike Russow-4.5/5
Gabriel Gonzaga/Chris Tuchscherer-2/5
Ed Herman/Aaron Simpson-4/5
Brandon Vera/Krzysztof Soszynski-4/5
Nate Marquardt/Demian Maia-5/5
Chris Leben/Jake Rosholt-4.5/5
Keith Jardine/Thiago Silva-5/5
Randy Couture/Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira-5/5

The Gonzaga/Tuchscherer fight is a complete anomaly, and this set is quite worth the purchase. The only thing keeping it from five-star status is the bad hits & a serious injury in Herman/Simpson.",1295136000,,864,6.024390243902439
8375745,4,B002O0G2SS,"This was a great fight, but it really depends if you are a fight science fan or not.  All of the undercards are entertaining so if you are a fan of UFC, do not hesitate!",1266192000,,169,3.8285714285714287
8375746,5,B002O0G2SS,"If people were to doubt this event, then I'd advise them to think again. Yep, Minotauro Nogueira fell short against Frank Mir, WITH a staph infection, but he's still Main Event material. And yes, Randy Couture got whooped by Brock Lesnar. He's still a legend, and he still put a cut or two on Brock's face before it was all said and done. Now these two legends meet for a 3 round war. Couture has held the UFC belt in Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight divisions. Nogueira has held the belt in the UFC and Pride. I was looking forward to this Main Event, not realizing what a war it would be.

Keith Jardine and Thiago Silva, two sluggers. Both coming off of disappointing losses. Jardine fought one of his greatest losses in UFC 96, coming up short against Rampage Jackson. Thiago Silva experienced not only his first loss, but his first loss by KO against Lyoto Machida in UFC 94. Who's tougher? Who has it in them to make that next step?

A Portland, Oregon event, that's UFC 102. 2 DVD's, with 11 fights total. I will list those 11 fights below.

Disk 1: Preliminary Card
Marcus Aurelio vs. Evan Dunham: This may have been Aurelio's last chance to stay in the organization. Evan Dunham is from Eugene, Oregon, and made his debut by shutting up Per Eklund in UFC 95. This is a great scrap, and goes to a split decision.

Nick Catone vs. Mark Munoz: Both of these guys are coming off of losses. Catone lost to Tim Credeur, and Matt Hamill showed Munoz what a head kick is! These guys fought well, and this went to a split decision as well.

Tim Hague vs. Todd Duffee: This is a 7 second KO, UFC record!

Justin McCully vs. Mike Russow: Both guys looking for the finish, preferably the submission, but one guy dominates the whole fight. This wasn't the most exciting, and one guy couldn't see straight, but a unanimous decision was awarded for the dominating performance.

Gabriel Gonzaga vs. Chris Tuchscherer: This 1st round TKO could be considered controversial. A vicious kick to the cup, and the man still wants to continue fighting. That's one tough dude. But the winner got the TKO anyway in the 1st round.

Ed Herman vs. Aaron Simpson. TUF 3 runner-up Short Fuse, out of Portland Oregon, taking on a no nonsense fighter in the A-Train. A rough injury decides a quick injury TKO in the 2nd, but a great fight for both guys!

Disk 2: Main Card
Brandon Vera vs. Krzysztof Soszynski: The Polish Experiment is looking forward to this opportunity, while Vera wants to let him know THE TRUTH about taking this fight. Not too bad, and goes to a unanimous decision.

Nate Marquardt vs. Demian Maia: I didn't think this one would end so quickly, but it did, KO in 21 seconds!

Chris Leben vs. Jake Rosholt: Leben is back! And he wants to dominate in front of his home crowd. But, Jake Rosholt wants to win as well. And a submission is just what happens in the 3rd round.

Keith Jardine vs. Thiago Silva. Well, sometimes it doesn't take much, and somebody gets the KO in the 1st round.

Randy Couture vs. Antonio Rodrigo ""Minotauro"" Nogueira: What a fight! This was a great fight that went to a unanimous decision, and proved that both fighters deserved being in this Main Event!

I enjoyed this. Some may have expected more. But you get 11 fights, and some great special features on both DVDs. ENJOY!",1264550400,,3298,4.5210084033613445
8375747,5,B002O0G2SS,"Although I find these horribly lame and impossible to sit through...my husband likes to watch this junk and says he liked this one ;)
Must mention that he couldn't think of anything specifically fantastic about this particular set, just that it was good. Hardly shocking, they all seem the same to me.",1262217600,,301,4.8076923076923075
8375748,5,B002O0G2SS,"UFC 102 card showcased the debut of a few highly touted heavyweights(Todd Duffee, Mike Russow, and Chris Tuchscherer) MMA fans were dying to see in the UFC. UFC 102 had a total of 11 fights with 4 of them being heavyweights which I thought was cool cos usually there is only 1 to 2 heavyweight fights on a card. I gave this 5 stars solely for the main event between 2 MMA legends and former champions finally battling it out in the octagon, Randy Couture Vs. Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira. Many were skeptical if they still had it in them to compete with top 10 competition or if retirement was lurking around the corner. After watching the fight live I almost lost my voice...literally. This is one of those epic fights with 2 legends battling it out back and forth and giving it their all to show they're still top contenders in the sport and why they are so loved by their fans. This is most likely going to win best fight of 2009 at the World MMA Awards. The Co-Main event is between 2 heavy hitting light-heavyweights in need of a win,Jardine Vs. Silva won't let you down. This DVD is a must for any UFC/MMA fan or anyone who wants to see a thriller of a fight and also see a new UFC record set in a heavyweight prelim fight as well.
Other DVD features are the Countdown show, weigh-ins, behind the scenes, and all the Rogan post fight interviews. *Prelims are still on the 2nd disc but oh well. Here is the card:
Randy Couture Vs. Minotauro Nogueira
Keith Jardine Vs. Thiago Silva
Chris Leben Vs. Jake Rosholt
Nate Marquardt Vs. Demian Maia

*Ed Herman Vs. Aaron Simpson
*Gabe Gonzaga Vs. Chris Tuchscherer
*Justin McCully Vs. Mike Russow
