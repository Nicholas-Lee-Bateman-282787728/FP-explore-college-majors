1422566,5,B00005BCNI,"The Hollywood star system is a funny game. Some stars shoot very, very brightly for a long time and then for some reason fade out and are forgotten forever.

Other stars - think James Dean - only do a couple of movies, but seem to remain popular forever.

There is really no way to explain this interesting phenomenon.

What it does do is make it possible for dedicated film buffs to discover long forgotten talent and thrill to different movies than the ones that seem to be shown over and over again on cable.

Johnny Mack Brown is this type of star. He was huge in the 1930s and appeared in dozens of films. In some ways he was as popular as Bruce Willis is today.

Yet, almost no one remembers him.

If you are new to the Johnny Mark Brown ouvre of film, and you like westerns, I'd suggest you give it a shot.

This is a great, classic western film and it showcases exactly why Brown was so popular back in his day. He brings a charisma to the role that makes the film truly special and not just another Holywood hack job western.

The plot is fairly standard - in fact it's based like so many other films of it's time on the real life events in Deadwood - a town without law enforcement.

It will come as no surprise that Brown saves the day and the badguys are eventually run out of town and/or killed. That's what has to happen in a Western.

What makes it special is the way Brown sucks us into his charcater, makes us root for him and leaves us cheering as the final credits roll.

Five stars well earned.",1163462400,2,1514,4.222222222222222
1422567,5,B00005BCNI,"This is one of the earliest well produced sound westerns. As such, it works as the template for many similar films that would come out in the 1940s and even some modern films. The plot is the same as ""Last Man Standing"" where a group of outlaws take over an entire town adn a hero with a six gun has to come in and clean it up because the cops are too scared to do anything about it. Of course the hero rides into town, kills the bad guys and lets innocent people live in peace. There is a reason that after this film came out Hollywood kept making  more movies with the same plot.",1148342400,2,581,4.052173913043478
1422568,5,B00005BCNI,"Our ""Golden Age""club meets each Thursday to view movies from the last century (that is from the 30s and 40s, or even earlier years). We have many die-hard Johnny Mack Brown fans in our club and there was a near riot last week when it was announced that we would be viewing one of his classic Movies on DVD. There was-expectedly-a lot of backslapping and excited banter as the boys filed out of the room. Johnny's ability to hold your attention is outstanding and we felt we had spent our time profitably. Thanks a2zcds for preserving this old movie on DVD. The picture and audio quality are outstanding and I thoroughly enjoyed viewing the movie!""",1146528000,,647,4.6347826086956525
