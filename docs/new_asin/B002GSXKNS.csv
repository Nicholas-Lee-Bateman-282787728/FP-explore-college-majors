3925422,5,B002GSXKNS,What can one say about Bruce Willis. He's a tough as nails actor who delivers the best action in the roles he plays. G.Goff,1366329600,,123,4.166666666666667
3925423,4,B002GSXKNS,"Four very good movies, only drawback(s) is 9 yards and Last Man Standing were on the same disk 'Front and Back' and a 'plain' DVD. Also since they are all four stacked on top of each other the possibility of scratching is present.",1365897600,5,230,4.372093023255814
3925424,5,B002GSXKNS,"All great and Bruce for hours....These are to be enjoyed time after time...I am a fan of Bruce and  none of these disapoint. Told all my friends they should see, too! Bruce gets better all the time!!!!",1360972800,2,201,4.4324324324324325
3925425,4,B002GSXKNS,"LOVE 16 Blocks .. haven't see the other 3 in quite some time but they'll be fun to have on hand.  Bruce is severely underrated as an actor.  He is very watchable and it's always fun to see him in action.  He does ""weary"" very well (in ""Blocks"") and the action, once it kicks into gear, is pretty high level.  His adversary (a corrupt cop - David Morse) is a very worthy villian .. another excellent actor.",1358121600,2,405,4.220779220779221
3925426,4,B002GSXKNS,Four good Bruce Willis Movies.  Not his best movies but certainly enjoyable.  If you're a Bruce Willis fan you'll certainly enjoy this collection.,1353283200,,146,5.304347826086956
3925427,4,B002GSXKNS,"All four of these movies are a great choice if you don't care about the ""Die Hard"" series. It's a good buy!",1349913600,,107,3.909090909090909
3925428,4,B002GSXKNS,"The 4 films on 2 disks all worked fine, and at a great cost for Bruce Willis 'action' films, some I'd not seen before. Not bad for another 'rockem, Knock em' set of films.",1349481600,2,171,4.0588235294117645
3925429,5,B002GSXKNS,"With a few exceptions, Bruce Willis movies usually involve guns, unemotional steely confidence, and a need to think fast to escape seemingly impossible situations.  The lineup in this collection is no different, but it is a nice collection of variations on the theme, ranging from a favorite comedy (The Whole Nine Yards) to a sepia toned Prohibition period piece (Last Man Standing).

The video transfer of the four films varies.  The Whole Nine Yards, with a HDTV screen filling 1.85:1 aspect ratio, is the best image and sound transfer of the bunch.  It is almost Blu-ray perfect.  The other three films are 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratios.  The image and sound transfer of The Last Boy Scout is the worst of the bunch, rated subjectively as marginal.  It is still watchable though.  Last Man Standing and 16 Blocks I rate as sharp digital with solid sound.  All the movies are 5.1 Dolby but The Last Boy Scout almost comes across as monotone for some reason.

The keepcase container has two double sided discs with itty bitty teeny weeny writing around the center hole.  Unless you have superhero eyes you might need a bright light and/or a magnifying glass to choose which movie to watch.

If interested in the quad pack put it in your save-for-later purchase bin and keep an eye out for a price drop.  At $3 a movie or less it is a great deal.",1347580800,8,1349,4.665254237288136
3925430,5,B002GSXKNS,I really enjoyed all 4 movies a terrific package deal but also great movie that was a pleasure to watch thank you,1320105600,5,113,4.181818181818182
3925431,5,B002GSXKNS,"My son's cable wasn't in at his new apartment yet so I ordered this set for him.

He watched them all in one day.

Now he loves me, and Bruce Willis movies.

Said they were great quality and no issues at all. I sometimes wonder about these sets, this one is good in all respects.

3925494,4,B002GSXKNS,"the whole nine yards 5 out of 5 stars: cute comedy with bruce willis as a hitman, done similar in style to his movie Hudson Hawk;  the last boy scout and last man standing: were ok i guess;  16 blocks: I don't remember anything about 16 blocks even though I watched it only a few weeks or months ago, so it was probably nothing special, good or bad. PS the whole 10 yards is the continuation/sequel to the whole 9 yards but is not as good as the whole 9 yards.",1408406400,3,460,4.043956043956044

3925497,5,B002GSXKNS,These span various characters and Bruce Willis is excellent in each.  He should have gotten an award for 16 Blocks.,1387929600,,115,4.75
3925498,5,B002GSXKNS,Bruce Willis at his best. The man is a good actor too bad he is not so nice in his personal life. And we have to be a party to it because he refuses to train himself to disgression. He had the most beautiful woman in the world and trew her away for a peace of tail. Now is doing the same with the second wife. Who seems to be hanging on until she can get a great settlement. And yes Bruce that is how the public sees you as an idiot who can not and will not curb his animal instints. Men who act as you do and let it out in public think they are sexy. but in reality we all know it is because you know in your heart that you are inferior but keep trying to put on a front to prove elsewise .,1381017600,,691,3.675675675675676

8369960,4,B002GSXKNS,"Lots of Bruce Willis action. In 16 Blocks he plays a dirty cop who must escort a witness to court. The dirty cops in his precinct are out to stop him. In The Whole Nine Yards, Bruce's neighbor suspects he is a mafia hitman and the neighbor's efforts to determine the truth create a lot of laugh. In The Last Man Standing, he gets into triuble with one of the gangs in town and as he resolves the problem he becomes involved in the lives of the people in the town. In The Last Boy Scout, he plays a detective who is hired to protect an exotic dancer. His wife is cheating on him and his daughter doesn't like him. His client is murdered and he and his client's boyfriend must find the killers.",1470355200,,692,4.1716417910447765
