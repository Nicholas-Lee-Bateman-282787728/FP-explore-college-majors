664854,5,6303482295,"Wes Anderson has really outdone himself with this picture.  I mean visually and narratively it's stunning and will blow you away.  Within seconds you are taken from your seat and teleported to this tiny town on the far outs of earth where this mysterious story unfolds. It's as if you instantly get to travel to wherever your imagination may take you.  I know it's been said before, but I cannot believe the amount of detail Anderson puts into his films.  From the writing, to the buttons on the costumes and even the way the characters move onset; everything is so utterly fine-tuned and perfect. Lord only knows the amount of time he spent putting this all together.  The only thing I wish is that the Grand Budapest Hotel were real as I would like to go visit it.

664855,5,6303482295,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is one of those elegantly created, artsy productions unlikely to rake-in the gazillions earned by those action-improbable films loved by the masses for their grandiose special FX and explosively noisy sound tracks.

The story of THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, told by the current owner, Zero Moustafa, in an extended flashback, is how he acquired the grand old pile after starting out as a lowly Lobby Boy in the 1930s. The two main protagonists are Ralph Fiennes as Monsieur Gustave H., the then concierge, and Tony Revolon as the (young) Zero Moustafa, the Lobby Boy. And the film is chock-a-block with big-name stars  Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson, Harvey Keitel, and Bill Murray  all of whom, I suspect, signed-on because it promised to be so much fun.

Mind you, the plot and its execution are comedic and thus a little silly; but the movie must be seen for the visuals. Each scene, many of which are sight gags, is of such an exacting stylishness in conceptualization, color and composition that the use of pre-shoot storyboards to set-up the shots must have been extensive and labor-intensive. And, when the Director yelled ""Action!,"" the pre-determined actor positioning, movement and viewing angles were apparently meticulously adhered to. And it doesn't hurt that all players perform flawlessly in the timing of their delivery  spoken lines, facial expressions and gestures.

I left the theater having been exquisitely entertained and delighted by the lan of the presentation (as opposed to being bludgeoned into my seat by cinematic overkill).",1396137600,15,1660,5.198501872659176
664856,5,6303482295,"Writer/Director Wes Anderson (""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") is at it again. I find this movie far more accessible than some of his previous films (""The Darjeeling Limited"") so I'm happy. Inspired by the work of Stefan Zweig (""Letter From an Unknown Woman""), this is a goofy triumph of R- rated filmmaking.

We follow the (mis)adventures of a legendary concierge in a legendary hotel at a time when a legendary war threatens the borders of this legendary country. I can't recall a recent film that tickled so many of my funny bones: from the amazing production design (both interior AND exterior); the machine-gun dialogue and tongue-in-cheek humor; to a demonstration of the brotherhood of hotel concierges; plus, for movie fans, one famous face after another.

We spot:
  * Ralph Fiennes (""Coriolanus"") has a blast as Gustave H., the super-efficient concierge. Compared to his usual dramatic roles, this whimsical comedy is a great change of pace for Fiennes.
  * Tony Revolori (Lots of TV) is Zero, his loyal lobby boy.
  * F. Murray Abraham (Lots of TV) is, many years later, the older Zero.
  * Tilda Swinton (""Moonrise Kingdom"") is soon a corpse. That's all I'm gonna say...
  * Mathieu Amalric (""Quantum of Solace"") may or may not be her killer.
  * Jeff Goldblum (""The Switch"") is a lawyer who comes to read her will.
  * Adrien Brody (""Midnight in Paris"") is a frustrated would-be heir.
  * Bill Murray (""Monuments Men"") is one of MANY resourceful concierges
  * Saoirse Ronan (""Hanna"") is a candy maker. I'm including her because there are so few women in this cartoony cast!

I'm running out of space and haven't scratched the top layer of actors.

Frantic and silly, this absurd adventure out-Andersons the previous works of Wes Anderson! Remember, in Anderson's comedies, everyone plays his or her role absolutely straight. This always enhances the comedy.

Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can tell my JayFlix.net folks.",1396137600,2,1944,4.932098765432099
664857,5,6303482295,"Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" exceeds even ""Moonlight Kingdom"" as a dazzling good time at the movies, flamboyant both in story and in visual style. Anderson and co-screenwriter Hugo Guinness create a story within a story within a story, in which a beloved author (Tom Wilkinson) tells in old age of a meeting between his younger self (Jude Law) and the mysterious billionaire Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) in Zero's crumbling but once-legendary hotel, the Grand Budapest. Zero takes the author back to 1932, when, as a young lobby boy (Tony Revolori), he worked at the Grand Budapest in its glory days under the tutelage of the greatest concierge in history, the magnificent Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes).

""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a wonderfully Byzantine tragicomic story, stuffed with all sorts of hilarious double-crosses, clandestine meetings, dastardly conspiracies and general skullduggery. The central question is whether M. Gustave was responsible for the death of an ancient grande dame (Tilda Swinton), or whether the blame can be laid to her weaselly son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and his sinister henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Along the way are all sorts of colorful characters played by a Who's Who of star character actors including Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saiorse Ronan, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Mathieu Amalric and Jason Schwartzman. Most of them are on screen for only a few minutes, and some (Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban) have roles that can be measured in seconds. No matter. All of them add to the sparkling experience that is ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" The film is a magnificent visual experience, thanks to the cinematography of Robert D. Yeoman, the editing of Barney Pilling, the production design of Adam Stockhausen and the costumes of Milena Canonero. But it's the surreal verbal wit of Anderson and Guinness' screenplay that audiences will remember, such as this exchange already well-known through the film's trailer:

M. GUSTAVE: She was dynamite in the sack.

ZERO: She was eighty-four.

M. GUSTAVE: I've had older.

""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a grand fairy tale, made deeper and richer by Anderson's knowledge that ""Happily Ever After"" is an illusion even in fairy tales. Anyone who likes sweeping cinematic epics with more than a touch of whimsy should love it.",1396137600,6,2330,5.2026666666666666
664858,5,6303482295,"I had been waiting to see Wes Anderson's latest project from the moment it was announced. The Canadian release date was delayed, and then ended up being limited to a few theaters. I'm happy to say that it finally made it to a local theater and I saw it at the earliest opportunity a few hours ago.

To describe the plot would be both difficult and pointless. Wes Anderson is an acquired taste and fans are likely to love everything he releases. The Grand Budapest Hotel certainly has the same tongue-in-cheek tone of his previous films, and the similarities don't end there. Neil Young once said that his output was all one song, and Anderson's feels like all one film.

The story is beautifully framed, with an old man recollecting his past to an interested writer. The images are typical Anderson, with the usual explosion of colors and storybook settings. This feeling is heightened by the use of title cards to denote the chapters and the familiar style of music used in previous efforts. The story takes place in three different time periods, but we spend most of our time in 1932. All of the scenes from the past are shown in full screen, while the main narration sequences are in widescreen.

All I will say about the plot is that is focuses on hotel employees M. Gustave (Fiennes) and Zero Moustafa (Revolori). Gustave dates old women and one of them leaves him a valuable painting in her will. Her family are rather annoyed, and hire someone to retrieve the painting. The story is incredibly detailed and vast, despite only running for 100 minutes. There are frequent moments of witty humor, farce, irony and visual gags. Most of Anderson's regulars appear in the film at some point, and it's a tribute to him that such talents are willing to show up for such limited screen time.

Fiennes is very effective as Gustave. He's eloquent, and fond of reciting poetry, but his comic timing is perfect throughout. The vocabulary is not what you would expect from a typical movie, but it is offset with occasional expletives, which are extremely funny in the context of the film.

I was reassured by the large audience that showed up on a Saturday morning to watch a film by a director who does nothing to try to appeal to the masses. There is a shootout scene, but not like anything you have ever witnessed. Wes Anderson is like Stephen King or David Lynch in the way that he slightly skews reality; unlike those two, Anderson's stories are much lighter in tone. I despise cruelty to animals, but you'll laugh at a scene involving a cat. It's similar to Snoopy's fate in Moonrise Kingdom.

It's so refreshing to see a filmmaker with ideas. Aren't you tired of seeing Hollywood blockbusters that are predictable and tired? Grand Budapest will never let you relax because there is so much information to absorb. The dialogue is strange, the settings are like something out of a dream, numerous objects and props are weird in themselves. It took me a few moments to come back to reality after the movie because I was still in that world as I walked out of the theater. I didn't even hear someone call my name until their third try.

I imagine The Grand Budapest Hotel will reveal new things every time you watch it, and I can't wait to add it to my collection and see it again. This may be Anderson's most accessible film to date, but he definitely hasn't deviated from his unique style.",1396051200,271,3387,4.616279069767442
664859,5,6303482295,"Elegant, zany, laugh out loud funny and beautifully executed from start to finish, the latest from Wes Anderson's wild imagination is a wonderful film with a timeless and wonderfully executed story to tell.

The Grand Budapest Hotel follows the misadventures of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and Zero Mustafa (newcomer Tony Revolori) as they avoid a bitter family out for their heads, a persistent yet misguided police force and the military of their fictional country.  It's as lively and exciting as one might think, but Anderson's talent for film directing is finally at it's peak.  A deliciously whimsical adventure ensues, and with an all star cast permeating this wonderful movie landscape things can only be wonderful.  The themes of humanity and responsibility are well though out, and the impending fear of war within this illusionary tale make for a great juxtaposition against the backdrop of grave tragedy.

First and foremost, this is a Wes Anderson movie.  It is whimsical, darkly comedic but isn't without its wonderful bits of humanity and heartwarming character development.  Everything is here, from the sweeping panoramas, zoom shots and dioramas for sets that we expect.  The sense of direction and style is impeccable, and throughout this myriad of genres his pleasant and unique style shines brightly.  Everything from the pacing to character development is perfect; While the film does clip along, nothing feels rushed.  I absolutely loved every moment of this frenzied doll house escapade, from the whimsical moments of action to the darkly comical poetry of Ralph Fiennes' character.

Speaking of which, Ralph Fiennes is in the zone; M. Gustave is one of his finest roles he's played in his whole career.  Bitingly funny, endearing and lovable, M. Gustave steals the show.  But without the rest of the cast (Tony Revolori, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Adiren Brody, Jude Law...the list goes on) The Grand Budapest Hotel wouldn't be nearly as entertaining or lively as it is.  Anderson has put together an incredibly talented cast, and everyone does a phenomenal job (even Owen Wilson)!  The dynamics between various characters, the writing and the screenplay are absolutely fantastic.

Musically The Grand Budapest Hotel perfectly complements the film also.  It's whimsical, lively, and comical while also being very unique.  Epic lute solos, gorgeous choirs and those typical ""Anderson beats"" permeate the entirety of the film.  It's absolutely wonderful, from unique start to whimsical and silly finish.  Specific scenes also have a musical arc (one of the best examples is the monastery scene), and being a music fan this complexity and symbiosis of score and film is wonderful.

My biggest complaint is actually something that I appreciate, which is odd!  The Grand Budapest Hotel is a story told from different perspectives throughout the years.  When the film cuts to the 1930's, it changes to a 4:3 perspective to mimic the style things were filmed back in the day.  While this historical nod is excellent, I wish the entirety was in widescreen.  Anderson's films are very detailed and the scenes are filled with amazing detail; With this I feel that Anderson almost does his own film a disservice by cutting off and making the aspect ratio as it is.  Also, some mild obscenities (played for laughs, and are indeed quite funny and help to characterize villains) may seem too weirdly out of place to really be funny for some.

The Grand Budapest Hotel is a treat.  For the eyes, for the ears, and also for the heart.  The relationship that sprouts between M. Gustave and Zero Mustafa are some of the most believable and endearing moments of any of his films, as well as any new films I've seen of late.  The story is original, the music is wonderful, the acting and script is typical Anderson; everything about  The Grand Budapest Hotel sings.  If you don't take my word for it, consider that the theater filled with middle aged and older audience members was laughing out loud constantly and finished the film with a lively round of applause.

Thank God for Wes Anderson, one of the only original artists left in Hollywood.

EDIT: I just saw it again in an off campus arts theater, and I loved it just as much (if not more) the second time.  The humor is so quick and snappy the jokes never get old, and the great themes and story really resonate a second time through.  Absolutely a fantastic film.",1396051200,247,4443,4.989130434782608
664860,5,6303482295,"Theatrical review.

For me director/writer Wes Anderson has been an acquired taste.  Certainly the animated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (2009) and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012) have become personal favorites.  This film has joined the list of brilliant filmmaking.  Part 1930's Keystone Cops, part romance, part mystery, part thriller and part about anything else, Anderson has created a world he clearly enjoys but may be a bit strange to the rest of us.  Using fictitious settings, characters and evil empires he tosses in terra cotta and other pastels to brighten an otherwise place of increasing darkness in the world.

The time is the 1930's (with flashbacks and flash-forwards) and the setting is a country high in the mountains of Eastern Europe.  M. Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes)is the concierge at the upscale titled hotel.  For all practical purposes, he runs the place.  His services are readily available especially to the elderly widows that seek him out.  He is always accommodating and fairly suggests gender is not an issue.  One of his favorite clients is the rich and powerful Madame D. (an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) who at 84 ""isn't the oldest he's...uh serviced"" he announces.  Under his tutelage is ""lobby boy"" Zero (Tony Revolori).  When interviewed for the job, Gustave asks, ""Why do you want to be a lobby boy?""  ""Who wouldn't"" Zero responds.

Zero is played in later life by F. Murray Abraham who is telling the story to a young writer played by Jude Law.  When Madame D. dies, a valuable painting is left to Gustave much to the chagrin of her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and her 3 ugly daughters.  When Gustave, who along with Zero have gone to the funeral,  realizes Dmitri isn't going to let him leave the castle with the painting, he decides to just take it, which leads them off into the wintery slopes.

Anderson fills up the story with an assortment of regulars including Jeff Goldblum as Madame D.'s executor, Harvey Keitel as a prison inmate, Edward Norton as a military police detective, Saoirse Ronan as Zero's girlfriend complete with a large raspberry birthmark on her cheek, ""shaped like Mexico"" as well as Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and Bob Balaban as fellow concierges.  What is so wonderful about this movie is the silliness of course, but also a nostalgic look back at a bygone era before storm troopers and Ruskies took over that part of the world.  Anderson and his wonderful set designers came up with an unusual but satisfying look at the period.  Often using miniatures, it just looks great.  The film revolves around Fiennes great performance as Gustave.  He spits out the words placed there by Anderson with a sense of confidence, breeding and intellect.  And he's funny as hell.  Highly recommended.",1395964800,430,2753,4.943355119825708
664861,5,6303482295,"Wes Anderson is not your typical film maker, not by any standard. His films are, at best, quirky or, if it's not the kind of thing you like at all, actually, I suppose the best would be something more along the lines of weird. At any rate, they're different. If you want explosions and action, you're probably better off going somewhere else. Although there was a ski chase in this one...

The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably Anderson's best film. It's full of prison breaks, cats flying out of windows, and lots of perfume. It has a lot of humor, some of it black (like the cat flying out the window), and is full of weird and interesting characters. Also, it's a story within a story within a story. I still like Moonrise Kingdom the best, though.

Rather than talk about the movie, because I don't want to be spoilery, let's talk about the actors:

Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave: I am not always completely satisfied with Fiennes. He seems to oscillate between extraordinary and, well, pretty awful. I'm not sure if it's that he just sometimes chooses poor roles or if he's erratic as an actor. Whatever the case, he was delightful in Grand Budapest. Utterly charming and debonair. It's a good thing, too, since the weight of the movie was on him. He pulled it off magnificently.

Adrien Brody as Dmitri: Not the role required much of him, but Brody was great in the role. He looked the part, and he played the part. What more can you ask?

Willem Dafoe as Jopling: Dafoe is just kinda creepy all by himself so, when you put him in a role as someone who is creepy, you kind of can't miss. Not to mention the... I don't know; it's like they gave him lower jaw fangs or something. Certainly not someone you want to mess with.

Jeff Goldblum as Deputy Kovacs: I'm not sure Goldblum went out of his way in this part; I mean, it's not like it required that much, but I loved him in it. He's just got a... presence, and I wish he did more movies. favorite line from Grand Budapest: ""Did he just throw my cat out the window?""

[Can you see the theme with the flying cat? That's my theme, not a theme of the movie.]

Jude Law as Young Writer: Law has a great voice, so he works great as the story teller. Well, the story re-teller.

Tilda Swinton as Madame D.: If I hadn't known it was her, I wouldn't have known it was her. My only issue with the movie, if you can call it that, is that Swinton plays a woman about three decades older than she is, and I don't know why Anderson wouldn't just get someone of the appropriate age to play the part. But, then, there's Swinton doing this amazing job bringing that peculiar look she has even though you can't tell it's her at all, and I guess Swinton was the right choice.

Tony Revolori as Zero: Actually, Revolori was great as the sidekick/counterpart/protege to Gustave. His very direct manner worked to cut through Gustave's some of Gustave's pretense and offered some great moments in the movie. ""Don't flirt with her.""

It was also great to see Bill Murray and Owen Wilson make appearances. Oh, and Jason Schwatzman.

There are other actors I could mention, but these are the ones I thought stood out. These are not in any order, either. I mean, I didn't put them in any kind of descending order; I just went down the cast list and commented on the ones I had something to say about.

So... If you like Wes Anderson's movies, this one will certainly not disappoint. If you've seen others of his movies and were put off by them, this one is no different and won't convert you. Probably. If you've never seen an Anderson film, I'd say this one is a good one to start with. Or Moonrise Kingdom; you can't forget that one.",1395878400,3,3663,4.392909896602659

664863,5,6303482295,"This video is one of the ""Super Cities"" series produced by the International Video Network, which consists of one-half hour tapes of 22 of the more interesting cities in the world. They are, far and away, the best travel videos that I have seen.
The approach that the producers take is to mix aerial and ground footage in roughly 50/50 proportions. This approach is especially effective for Budapest, which is actually two cities (Buda and Pest) divided by the Danube.
What comes across is what must be an exceptionally pleasant city to live in, especially in the summer, with numerous parks and outdoors cafes. While there are some interesting sights, however, they are limited in both number and quality. As a result, I took Budapest off my list of places to visit.
That, of course, is one of the things that a good travel video should do--provide you with enough information to make an intelligent decision as to whether or not to visit a place.
The Super Cities series also includes a tape on Istanbul, which is similar to Budapest (in mixing elements of East and West), but is a far more interesting city.

I thought the Darjeeling limited was weak and didn't care at all for The Fantastic Mr. Fox. I'm just letting you know that so you can see that I come from an unbiased point of view. I judge the work and the work only.

Now let's get onto the movie. To be honest before watching Grand Budapest I didn't really have high hopes and wasn't expecting much. And I was alright with that. I loved Moonrise Kingdom and was just happy he went back to his roots on that one. And for some reason I thought Grand Budapest was going to be on the same level as The Darjeeling limited (which I didn't care for). So needless to say I went into this movie with low expectations.

After finally getting around to watching The Grand Budapest Hotel my first thoughts were that it was just ok. Better than expected but nothing great. But being a huge Wes Anderson fan I bought the movie a few months later just to add to my collection. And one boring night I decided to give it another go to see if I missed anything. And let me say the second viewing really opened my eyes to how great this film is. It has everything that people have grown to love about Wes Anderson films. That night I came to the conclusion that the Grand Budapest Hotel is classic Wes Anderson.

If I had to compare it to any of Wes Anderson's other works I would most likely say it has a Royal Tenebaums and Life Aquatic vibe. So if you love those two then you'll more than likely enjoy Grand Budapest. If your a huge Wes Anderson fan and don't really care for it the first time like I did then give a few months or so and revisit the film. You never know it might just end up being one of your favorite Anderson movies. Overall I personally think this is Wes Anderson's best work since The Life Aquatic. And that's saying a lot!",1500249600,,2057,4.163316582914573
667365,3,6303482295,"Though a charming, stylish, and well thought out character exposition, accompanied with a clever and well written dialogue, this movie was boring, uninteresting, and simply a show of colors and props. The story was very slow and had a very undefined structure, which made it hard to fall in love with. In fact, all the pieces didn't become truly appreciated until the last thirty minutes of the movie. Wes Anderson is a very curious director, and carries within his movies a certain nostalgia, but I believe this movie was not the masterpiece it was made out to be, nor did it have the comedic touch I was expecting. It did however contain within it that childishly sweet comedic pause which Anderson loves so well. I would definitely not advise one to watch this movie, unless you are a true fan of Wes Anderson and completely appreciate his work for every last detail. Also, on the parental side of things: PLEASE, if your child is under the age of 17, DO NOT LET THEM WATCH THIS FILM. There are multiple circumstances where women are shown full nude and I will list them here as best as I can. 1). when Zero, in the beginning, montages M. Gustave's love life. The third or fourth shot is of him in bed with a woman full nude. 2.) In the prison cell, where M. Gustave is planning his escape with fellow inmates (this scene will appear when M. Gustave is shown passing out mush in the prison) there are multiple pictures of nude women in multiple angles and shots. There is very little time in that scene where a nude woman is not displayed on the screen. Aside from these, there are no more visually sexual slanderous images, but there is plenty of verbal sexual talk which is considered immoral by many and disgusting at best. So please, please, please, please, please don't let anyone younger than 17 watch this, because you will be surprised how fast they will be scarred, and you won't catch it in time, I promise.
Aside from that, I'd say, though charming, brilliantly acted, and a great example of Anderson's style, I ended up disappointed and wanting my money back, for I was only mildly entertained. Maybe I didn't fully understand it, but for me, this movie was worth only 3 stars.",1499990400,,2192,4.580152671755725
667366,1,6303482295,"Great disappointment for an Anderson fan.  It is a comedy that is not really funny.  Dialogue pretends to be literate and European but littered with obligatory obscenities in American or at best British accents. Ralph Fiennes is present throughout the movie with his sidekick, but the movie is filled with cameos by a handful of recognizable actors.  Oh, there is a story line but it is really nonsensical which is not necessarily a bad thing if it did not  affect a moral tone.

If you are expecting anything like ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", you will be sorely disappointed.",1499644800,3,571,4.845360824742268

I certainly enjoyed it the first time through; it is visually stunning and star-studded, but the subtle humor that permeates the movie initially eluded me. It wasn't until I watched it again several weeks later that the brilliance of the script became apparent and I developed a deeper appreciation for the writing.

I'd recommend a quick Wikipedia read on him, as a couple of scenes in the movie will make more sense; and the film's smart, poignant tribute can be better appreciated along the way (without impacting the storyline of the movie).",1484611200,,437,4.8

Watching these grotesques trying so hard, so very hard, so painfully hard, to be artsy and clever in their comic-book poses is startling.  The vulgarity is stupid.  The fake accents are grating.  These ridiculous, distasteful characters then strut and stomp on top of a childish, silly plot, such as it is.

Have you ever watched a movie where they are portraying a scene from an old Civil War-era melodrama where the villain is twirling his fake mustache and everyone is chewing the scenery?  Its usually done for a bit of comic relief and lasts just a minute.  Here it goes on and on.

Grand Budapest has cameo performances from finest actors today & that alone is worthy of a single viewing. Ralph Fiennes gives his best character performance ever & sublimely enhances the entire film.

671128,4,6303482295,"I'm not the raving fan I hoped to be after seeing the trailers...  but it's a quirky, funny, and mildly disturbing way to waste a couple of hours. A few amusing twists heighten the enjoyment, but brief and COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY violence against an animal dampen the sense of playfulness...

All in all it tries a little too hard for my taste but it's very ingenious at times. Unfortunately, it's not ""artful"" like a Cohn brothers production, which was the impression I formed from the trailers... too calculated and relies too much on stereotypes. After the Royal Tenenbaums, Moonrise Kingdom, The Fantastic Mr Fox, and The Darjeeling Limited, I expected more from Anderson...  but then there's Rushmore and The Life Aquatic -- meh!

That said the story unfolds nicely with Abraham's well-paced, engaging narrative.

Disclosure: I'm not a Fiennes fan anyway, so...  but his performance here is lively and amusing.

If you like cameos, Swinton, Wilson, Murray, and Saoirse Ronan as Agatha, et al, are TOTALLY worth it.  Best performance is by relatively unknown Tony Revolori as the younger version of Abraham's character Zero Moustafa!",1478476800,4,1136,5.135869565217392

It is very similar in tone to Moonrise Kingdom but I like Grand Budapest much better. This is the definition of an ensemble cast and is without a doubt the finest acting of Ralph Fiennes career.

Ralph Fiennes is superb! Tony Revolori is a fantastic young talent -- fantastic enough to share the screen with Fiennes, which isn't something that just anyone can do. Their chemistry is just magnificent.

672714,3,6303482295,"Wes Anderson's THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is the director's celebration of Central Europe culture and fashion in the years between the World Wars, and an elegy for what was lost with the rise of fascism and communism. Set in 1932 in a fictional country called Zubrowka, the streets, military regalia and (ersatz) German names we are shown could have come from anywhere between Germany and Estonia. Its protagonist Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) is a concierge at the eponymous luxury hotel, the splendour of which disappeared, we are told, with World War II. Gustave H. is known publicly as one of the best concierges in the business, able to dash around the hotel at lightning speed to satisfy the most varied guests of the elite clientele. Privately, he's a rake with a rather foul mouth, and fond of bedding the rich old women who patronize the establishment. When one of those old ladies, Madame Cline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) dies and Gustave is framed for her murder, he must evade the law and unmask the true culprit, with the help of newly hired lobby boy Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori).

The films of Wes Anderson are known for their immense visual detail, and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is no exception. The elaborate framing of shots, the myriad cute items to look at on every set, and the architectural detail are like a diorama blown up to the big screen. Curiously, that visual detail is matched to a real slackness in the human characterization. Anderson has brought in a large number of actors he had worked with before, including Adrien Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, and Bill Murray, for roles that range from the main villain to little more than cameos. These characters are never fleshed out like Gustave H. or Zero Mustafa, and the actors don't even try to pass themselves off as Central Europeans from the entre deux guerres. Instead Adrien Brody plays Adrien Brody, etc.

There are two supporting roles that I felt were stronger. William Defoe plays a nearly mute henchman whose look is a nod to early vampire films (Transylvania was Central Europe, too). More remarkable is Harvey Keitel's turn as an old prisoner: when so many handsome leading men try to hide the effects of time after they enter their sunset years, 75-year-old Keitel was not afraid to show the ravages of old age here.

Unfortunately, I found the 21st-century Americans strutting about (and a few speaking in rough New York accents) in a historical drama to be jarring. I was also disappointed by the resort to Hollywood tropes here, when Anderson's earlier films managed to be very quirky and sui generis. For example, did we really need not just one scene where a character is hanging off a cliff's edge as the villain stands over him, but two? And the amount of plot details that are introduced but never really explained makes one feel that the work was subject to some heavy cuts to please a studio.

Still, if you liked Wes Anderson's earlier films, you'll find much to enjoy in his dollhouse approach, and it is amazing how every one of his films has a completely new and fresh visual theming even if his quasi-autistic obsession with prettiness never changes. Another thing I liked about the film is its ""story within a story within a story"". The entire plot of Gustave H. is, we are shown, taken from a fictionalized treatment by a writer who met a middle-aged Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) in the 1960s. Befitting this novelistic layer -- and the work of Stefan Zweig that Anderson credits for inspiration -- this framing story is written in stilted, unrealistic dialogue like an old-time novel. And the aspect ratio changes for each layer of the film, a little treat for cinema anoraks.",1471392000,,3702,4.788732394366197

It is like looking into the window of an old Conditerei Cafe in Vienna and then realizing how all of that is quickly disappearing. It is funny and loaded with pseudo literature but is also very poignant about the decrepitude that hit Europe after the second world war. Orange and brown replace the pink and white grandeur that once was. What a hoot!

I recommend this movie on the basis of fun. Not juvenile. Not schadenfreude. Certainly not highbrow. Just fun.
  This movie is in the best of company with such great parodies a Murder by Death and Young Frankenstein and it bears up to the comparisons well. The architecture was amazing, many of the sets richly authentic of bygone eras of wealth and privilege, mixed with purely caricatures of kitchens and prisons and even museums.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But it was amazing. I loved Life Aquatic and Royal Tenenbaums so I knew I would like this, but the trailer fails to reveal any of the plot. The story was actually pretty impressive. The characters are all fantastic and the way everything comes together is great. I knew I would like it, but still ended up being pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Glad I bought it instead of renting, I'll definitely watch it again.",1460937600,,635,4.256198347107438

This is a beautiful-looking, highly-styled, clever but EMPTY film. These are Wes Anderson characters in Wes Anderson settings. The dialogue is cute, but gets old by the end ... there's no arc, no development ... just odd, quirky characters who are odd and quirky for the sake of it.

Rushmore and Moonlight Kingdom worked because the characters were great, lonely people. There are no great characters in GBH ... and the story is thin ... but it does look nice",1451174400,,730,4.607692307692307

680768,5,6303482295,"With the possible exception of Interstellar, the Grand Budapest Hotel was my favorite movie of 2014. From both a storyline and visual perspective, Wes Anderson was clearly devoted to mastery the small details of this film.

The story opens with a series of quick jumps in time. At first, a young woman visits the grave of a man known only as ""The Author."" It then skips back to the 1980s when the Author as an older man begins to record and narrate his tale. It then goes to the 1960s, when a younger version of the author, played by Jude Law, first encounters the proprietor of the Grand Budapest Hotel. They establish a bond and over dinner, the proprietor tells the story of how he came to own the hotel. Most of the film from then on takes places in the 1930s. The manager of the hotel is a middle-aged, crone-seducing perfectionist named Gustave. He insists that every aspect of the hotel be perfect, be it the rooms, uniforms, delicacies served at dinner, or the behavior & background of his staff. It is these early scenes showing the hotel's functioning that are perhaps the greatest visual delights of the film. We are soon introduced to Gustave's newest hire: a young refugee with no family named Zero. Gustave agrees to hire him on a probationary basis, and almost as soon as he does, one of Gustave's former clients and lovers dies. Gustave and Zero go to the reading of the will, where it is announced that Gustave is heir to a Renaissance painting in the Flemish style named Boy With Apple.

The next hour of the film follows as Zero and Gustave try to hide with the painting while being pursued by the deceased woman's relatives. Gustave is wrongly suspect of having murdered her, so he must also attempt to avoid the police. By the end of the film, there have been multiple murders, a shoot-out at the hotel, and an resolution to each character's story that leaves one happy for a brief moment before being overwhelmed by sadness.

I have to say this film was a delight. One can look over the casting roll to see all of the famous actors who makes cameo appearances. As I have alluded to previously, the panoply of colors on display throughout the film is one of its strongest features. At its heart, I believe this is a film about the gradual decline of civilization. The end of the film briefly mentions that it was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig, and I believe it. Not only does the dialogue match the precision of his language, but Zweig's own life story of living in fin-de-siecle Vienna luxuriously, only to ultimately die in South America by his own hand as Hitler ravaged Europe typifies that pessimism. As shown in the contrasting scenes on the train with the police, while we may have advanced technologically, the old sense of style, manners, and culture has slowly disappeared or, as the film suggests, perhaps never existed at all. At the end, however, I think the film can be considered to have a happy ending for the simple fact that its characters' stories have been memorialized.

As for the Blueray DVD, it is excellent. There are small features, such as the pink bar that appears whenever you hit pause, that match the sense of humor of the film. Unfortunately, there are only a few special features. The most notable is Bill Murray touring the town of Gorlitz where the film was made. There are also a few trailers for other films. Surprisingly, however, there were no deleted scenes, which is something I found to be disappointing. Even if the DVD only came with the film, though, it would still deserve five stars. An excellent way to pass the evening.",1446595200,,3600,4.611544461778471
680769,3,6303482295,I don't see where all the hoopla is about this Wes Andersen film. I just don't get it. It's quite graphic in terms of violence and while the story is alright it's not new.,1446508800,,171,4.0588235294117645

It was a very fancy and proper hotel where everything is spotless and perfect.  The sets are vertical and square.  The manager takes his job seriously, as do his friends at the other grand hotels across Europe.  It is a sort of brotherhood of perfection.  While the manager is homosexual, his duties, perfectly performed, include some under the covers services to the wealthy dowagers who frequent his hotel.  Then the war happens, and everything is upset.  One of his clients is murdered by her greedy family, and he tries to correct the injustice.

680991,5,6303482295,"Wes Anderson is a master director of colorful vibrant films with stellar casts and scenery. I never expected to fall in love with a film this much but I did and hope others will follow. This beautiful colorful vibrant film is set in fictional hotel in Europe. The hotel is run by Gustav (Ralph Fiennes in one of best performances to date). Fiennes is wonderful as Gustav; charming, charismatic and just lovable. The story is told by Zero Mustafa, the lobby boy, who befriends his employer.

When Madame (played wickedly by Tilda Swinton) dies suddenly, Zero and Gustav go to the funeral and will reading. The ensemble reads like a who's who in character and supporting actors. The adult Zero us played by F. Murray Abraham, Academy Award winner and prominent stage actor. There are others like Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson OBE, Jason Schwartzmann, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Defoe, Jude Law, Bob Balaban, and more. The film rates an A in casting alone.

The film's art direction is just stunning for words. The colors and vibrancy offers something that special effects can't convey or translate. It is a very believable film despite the quirks and minor flaws. The costumes and makeup are all unique and award worthy. The film won Oscars for costume design, makeup, and original score. I would have voted the film for best picture and best actor for Ralph Fiennes.

The DVD features a couple extras like Mendl's recipe; the cast featurettes; and Wes Anderson's featurette. I wished there were more features on this DVD like the background and making of the film itself.

Wes Anderson proves to be one of the most brilliant film directors of his generation. I would love to see what he has next on his palette.",1445126400,,1746,4.829431438127091

There isn't much of a story. It feels more like a cartoon in that it's really bizarre and kind of starts nowhere and goes nowhere.

The cast is LOADED with all sorts of famous people - often with only one line. They pop up and then they are gone. One gets the feeling it was really a coup to be cast, but I am not sure why.

My suggestion is to try it. You will know within a few minutes whether or not this fits your taste. You will either find it really funny and well done or you will just have a question mark hanging over your head. I am in the latter category.",1444780800,,672,3.8550724637681157

The Grand Budapest Hotel contains various action sequences that definitely keep you on the edge wanting to find out more. The front of the dvd cover has multiple famous celebrity names that are attached to this movie (Bill Murray, Edward Norton,  Jude Law, Owen Wilson and more names etc).  The Grand Budapest Hotel opens with a popular and gifted concierge named Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes)  who is shown saying farewell to a wealthy and refined older lady named Madame D who loves him very much (Tilda Swinton).  Gustave H also takes a young apprentice named Zero (Tony Revolori) under his wing. Gustaves life starts to change dramatically after Madame D dies. Clues start to abound on what Gustave could be in for once he meets Madame Ds son Dmitri. Gustave admits to Dimitri of a relationship with Madame D that was more than just friends. However, Dimitri does not offer any sympathy to Gustave and rather chastises him for his romantic preferences for both men and women (through this scene alone the movie starts to paint the emotional tension that is starting between Dimitri and Gustave).

Maybe the director had fun making it but the script is hopeless.
There is not even some gypsy music to liven up the piece. My grandparents lived in Slovakia which was partvof the Austro-Hungarian empire and there was pride in speaking Hungarian because you were partr of an empire. It is supposed to be part of a grand hotel but apart from the red carpets there was nothing grand about it. A grand hotel would have  lots of concierges and lots of bell boys. the masterpiece which is supposed to be priceless is not by a world -recognised painter.  ..",1439078400,,764,4.686567164179104

682286,5,6303482295,"Wes Anderson's delightfully quirky, visually striking, surrealistic comedy about Gustave H, played marvelously by Ralph Fiennes, with a dead-pan comic seriousness, who is a perfectionist concierge of this famous and luxurious hotel. Pleasing his customers is his number one priority, even if that means having sex with the aging doyennes. Then there is Gustave H's adoring and trusty sidekick, Zero, the lobby boy, wonderfully played by young Tony Revolori, in a scene-stealing performance, he is a stoic and observant pupil, whose painted on pencil mustache suggests that perhaps he shares some of his mentors rarefied tastes. Soon mayhem will hit the grand hotel in the form of murder, revenge and a sinister dark plot. Brilliant direction by Wes Anderson, with terrific supporting performances by F. Murray Abraham, Mathieu Amairic, Adrien Brody, Williem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Kietel, Jude Law, Billy Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, and Tom Wilkinson. Impressive cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman, and a sensational score by Alexandre Desplat. An absurdly funny and original madcap comedy.

  The movie was telling a story in flashbacks.  That is fine.  But it was often very hard to follow.
  And we saw no point to the story.  What was the author of the story trying to communicate?  We had no idea.
  There was sadness, oddness, and a lot of profanity in the movie.  The main character, Mr Gustav, enjoyed being a male-whore to older women.  All of this seemingly without telling the audience what to take away from the story.
  In summary, a very confusing telling of the story, without entertainment or redemptive value.",1434240000,8,785,4.579710144927536

683166,5,6303482295,"I scratch my head at times wondering why a movie is nominated for the Academy Best Picture award . . . or maybe not realizing there are socio-political reasons within the Academy beyond artistic merit . . . but I cheered when this one showed up as a nominee. While it didn't take home the Oscar (losing it to Birdman, another superb movie), it was nominated for all the right reasons. Often touted a comedy I found it to be mostly a drama with major comedic elements. The movie starts with a teenage girl entering a cemetery and placing a hotel key onto a grave monument decorated with hundreds of other hotel keys. The grave is that of an author, and the girl is holding his published memoirs about The Grand Budapest Hotel, which she begins reading after decorating his grave marker. The story about the hotel begins, as told through the authors memoirs she is reading.

The four time periods:
(1) The present in 2.35:1 aspect ratio with the author's grave and the teenage girl reading his memoirs about the hotel.
(2) 1985, also 2.35:1 aspect ratio with the author writing his memoirs about a trip he made there 17 years earlier.
(3) 1968 in 1.85:1 aspect ratio when the author made his trip to the hotel and met Zero Moustafa, the hotel's owner, who told him his story about the hotel
(4) 1932 in 1.33:1 aspect ratio when Zero first started working at the hotel as a boy.

The first provides a simple framework at the beginning and end within which the rest of the story is told. The movie proper periodically moves between the other three timelines. Unlike some non-linear films, the different time lines in this one are easy to follow with different characters in each, obviously different eras and the different aspect ratios. The hotel is a resort in the fictional Central European Republic of Zubrowka. When the author visits in 1968, its a run-down shell of its former glory with few guests. The author befriends the elderly owner, Zero Moustafa, and they agree to meet over dinner. Moustafa begins his tale of how he acquired ownership of the hotel and why he keeps it open. The tale then fades back in time from 1968 to 1932 when Moustafa was taken on as a lobby boy after his town was razed and his parents executed. Zubrowka is on the verge of war with a neighboring country, which has equally fictional symbols, flags and emblems, but all the trappings of being governed by a militaristic, fascist dictatorship.

The hotels concierge takes Moustafa under his wing, mentoring him. There is plenty of mystery, adventure and intrigue with a war looming, the mysterious death of the hotel owner and the machinations of the hotel owners cruel and evil son. The drama is generously peppered with wry comic relief throughout. Wes Andersons touch in the story and the directing is quite evident.  Production design is lavish, with the hotels interior and exterior inspired by a combination of the Palace Bristol Hotel and Grandhotel Pupp in the Czech Republic, and the Grandhotel Gellrt in Hungary.

A grandly executed production, with excellent pacing and unpredictability in the plot making for some suspense and numerous surprises. The non-linear authors memoirs framework greatly enhances it. Its a Wes Anderson triumph deserving five stars for a magnificent story told magnificently well.",1434067200,,3300,4.813051146384479

If you ever visited some of the Former Republics of the Soviet Union prior to or just after the collapse - some of the visuals and turns of phrase will strike a little deeper and cut a little sweeter. As a matter of fact, I think that the bittersweet was one of the evocative elements that captured the spirit of a life style and an era.
No disrespect meant when I point out that shades of Robin Williams were felt as I watched the story and the acting unfold.  Watch it and you will see/feel what I mean.  A good quality bubbly - perfectly chilled - is almost a prerequisite as you settle back and prepare to be swept away.

From Nazi killer to Roman Soldier of Coriolanus, to Voldemort,to the sad sack of The Constant Gardner, watching him act is like watching water fill a vessel. He completely fills every part perfectly. And now he takes up the role of a serio-comic foppish concierge in an east European hotel, as if he had been doing high comedy his entire life.
Everyone in the movie is great. Newcomer Tony Revolo bounces his acting off of Fienne's as if they've been doing a double act for decades.

683859,5,6303482295,"Spoilers! I think everyone misses the idea behind this movie. It takes place during the Holocaust and if you were as confused as I was about this movie, it may help you to understand it if you place Gustave in the place of the older Zero. It makes so much more sense this way! Gustave was blonde and blue eyed. The Nazi's (or ZZ in this movie) would have had no problem with him unless he harbored Jews or foreigners or was actually homosexual which I believe he wasn't, he was just a flamboyant straight man who was bullied and mocked. After all, Abraham's character says Gustave lived in a time past his own. Anyway, at the end if the movie, something significant happens. The movie suddenly turns black and white. I take this to mean, of course what's coming is significant and dark, but also gray... In that what is about to happen may be the truth or not, it's black and white, we are in some kind of middle ground also expressed by the poem told by Agatha, that a moment in time two brothers, one from the East (Zero) and one from the West (Gustave) cross paths and become one. Then we see Zero get smashed with a rifle butt and Gustave lose it. I think Gustave likely didn't react that way and regretted it forever. He then assumed the persona of his best friend Zero and likely concocted stories seen in the news paper about how Zero escaped a Nazi camp in an uprising. Gustave then likely could have truly used the hotel to hide Jews and whomever as seen in the papers. Perhaps once again, he didn't, wished he had, and that added to his depression.

Now, older Zero, or Gustave... Had brown eyes. Blank eyes really. I think it is to reflect Gustave's emptiness. Agatha was killed during the ""Prussian Grippe"" meaning German grip.. She was Scottish in the film, a prime candidate for Nazi encampment. The older man at the end says he kept open the hotel in honor of Agatha. If it's Gustave as I believe, it is the truth. Paying close attention, Gustave respected Agatha because his ""brother"" loved her so well and in turn I believe Gustave would have loved her just the same. The old man also sleeps in the servant's quarters.. Likely where Zero stayed. I think Gustave could have slept there too in order to feel closer to his deceased friend whom he failed to save.

Truthfully, it could go either way. But there is a moment on the train when Abraham narrates that he never asked Gustave where he was from, and never asked about his family. We see a close up of Gustave staring blankly at the bunk above him where Zero was sleeping during this.. It makes me feel as though Gustave was thinking this and in turn, saying it. Not Zero. We find out later after a fight between the two that Zero left his country because of a civil war and his parents were killed. I think Gustave regrets this fight severely. If he had asked Zero ahead of time, he wouldn't have hurt Zero the way he did. Sure they make up, but the event after are very wacky and likely twisted truths.

In the end, I feel like the older man then presents himself as Gustave when he lays on the table a room key with Gustave's suite on it. I feel he was saying, this is who i am. Truthfully though, they were the same. But Gustave says that Zero was the better lobby boy, he was the most accommodating, more reason to think we are hearing Gustave's regret for not protecting his friend.

Other keys to this theory is the opening lines from the author about how writers understand when they are hearing a story and it's up to readers to interpret things themselves and to analyze things to understand the correctly. This would be pointless words of there wasn't a twist at the end as I believe there is.

It's a phenomenal film. I may be wrong. But I encourage all to watch this movie with the idea that Gustave is the old man who has come to model himself after Zero, a merging of two brothers, one who died, and one who regretted not being able to save him.",1429488000,,3931,4.35743519781719

685108,4,6303482295,"Initially, I had wanted to view this movie as I have gone to Budapest and love watching movies that take place in locations that I have visited, be they here or abroad; however, upon viewing the trailer, I decided ""NO WAY"" as it appeared to be of the Keystone Cops ilk.  Flash forward:  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award.  This made me think there must be something more to the movie, and so I purchased a copy.  Much to my pleasure, the Keystone Cops aspect was only one part of the film, and I must confess it was enjoyable!  So much for assumptions.  Now my only disappointment with the film is that the exterior of the hotel is portrayed as located high in the mountains--IT IS NOT--and the beautiful main bath in the Turkish Baths is portrayed as being miniscule when in reality it is GRAND.
I liked the story and was pleased to see how many great actors had roles in the film.  Willem Dafoe looked the part to a T.  Kudos to whomever did his teeth!",1427587200,2,965,4.322222222222222

685110,3,6303482295,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" begins in the present day, when the author of a popular book of that name is honored. Then it returns to that author (Tom Wilkinson) in 1985, when he explains that his stories don't sprout from his own mind, but are based on what he hears and observes of others. This time it is back to 1968, when the author stayed at The Grand Budapest Hotel in the fictional Central European nation of Zubrowka. The hotel was large and barely occupied, it's grandeur fading. There, he met the hotel's mysterious owner, a man named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who tells the author the story of how he came to own the hotel. This takes us back to the 1930s, when the hotel was full of wealthy guests, bustling staff, and magnificent dcor. Mr. Moustafa (Tony Revolori) was a teenaged immigrant then, employed at the hotel as a lobby boy under the tutelage of the establishment's fastidious taskmaster and concierge Mr. Gustave M. (Ralph Fiennes).

In the course of young Zero's service, he is made a fugitive from Police Inspector Henkels (Edward Norton), when Mr. Gustave is accused of murdering an elderly guest, the Dowager Countess Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton). The late Countess' lawyer (Jeff Goldblum) is pursued by a psychopathic killer (Willem Dafoe) at the behest of her son (Adrian Brody). Zero woos a pastry chef named Agatha (Saorise Ronan). And World War II begins. The cast is all-star, right down to the bit parts. I got the impression that they were having more fun than I was. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was written and directed by Wes Anderson, famous for his whimsy and oddball characters. But we never know much about these characters beyond the superficial. They are distant from the audience, like puppets, and therefore never engage us. The writing tends toward sloppy: clumsy framing, superfluous voiceover, pointless tangents. But, ultimately, the film just never engages the audience.",1427500800,,1951,4.948170731707317
685167,4,6303482295,"I went into this movie with mixed feelings.  I'm rather impatient and do not watch that many movies.  I had mixed feelings about, ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" mostly I did not like it.  When this movie started I immediately thought of that movie and was about to turn it off, but stayed put for a few more minutes.  I would say about 10 minutes in I became hooked and really liked it.  At first it seems to be a rather slow pace and there are sections in which you think that you can ""predict"" the outcome, but I was really surprised.  The characters really appealed to me and I would say it's a pretty good movie.  I would even watch it a second time, which is saying a lot for me.",1427500800,3,677,4.161538461538462
685168,5,6303482295,"...I loved it.

Wes Anderson movies are not to my taste, but Ralph Fiennes (M Gustav) and Tony Revolori (Zero) are so amazing that they make the movie more than the sum of its parts.

And what woman of any age could not love M Gustav? His manners and sense of decency are much lacking and missed in the modern world.

 Zero is his protg and most of this movie is about their growing friendship in a world gone to war, but it is Ralph Fiennes who is the heart of this movie and he never misses a beat.",1427500800,,500,4.02020202020202

686227,5,6303482295,"The Grand Budapest Hotel, directed by Wes Anderson is chock full of Hollywood A-listers in both cameo and substantial roles and with Anderson at the helm, the result is a film so quirky and brilliant that youll want to see it more than once.  The Grand Budapest Hotel is Andersons best film to date, a wry, exceptionally well-structured 5-act Shakespearean dramedy.  If you liked any of Andersons prior movies, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, The Royal Tenenbaums, or The Darjeeling Limited, to name a few, then The Grand Budapest Hotel will satisfy you in a way that these previous gems just narrowly missed.

First theres the superb M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), impeccably dressed with such dizzying attention to detail that Coco Chanel would be jealous.  Gustave runs the GBH, set amid a coniferous-lined mountainside, always gorgeously blanketed with a light dusting of snow, so breathtakingly beautiful it looks like CGI. Anderson used more than one locale for the filming to get just the right feel for the distinguished and sumptuous backdrop to the movie. At the GBH, Gustave not only runs a tight, elegantly appointed ship, he has a cadre of patrons, all older, almost all female, who return to the GBH to partake of the amenities that only M. Gustave can provide.  The young Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), so called, he says, because after losing his family and home in the war -- the movie is sandwiched between the first and second World Wars -- he is nothing and has no one.  Zero is hired by M. Gustave to maintain a specific role at the hotel, the actual description of which is unclear for while Gustave has a list of donts, it seems the lobby boys biggest do is to be Gustaves personal assistant.  Throughout the movie, we see Zeros allegiance to Gustave unfold and grow in a variety of wry and often hilarious ways.

The entire story is told in flashback by the enigmatic owner of the hotel, a much older Zero (F. Murray Abraham), to the Young Writer (Jude Law), who is a patron of the current GBH.  With its halcyon days behind it, a skeleton crew running it, and very few guests, the GBH is still going, maybe not strong, but going.  Abraham invites Law to join him for dinner and over many courses, unravels the beguiling history behind the hotel.  After one of Gustaves favored patrons, Madame D. (a sublime Tilda Swinton) is murdered, Gustave travels to Madame Ds side because, she needs me, meaning, he needs to make sure 1) she looks good and 2) to find out whether she left him a little something in her will.  At the reading, the lawyer, Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) announces to the family that Madame D. has left Gustave the priceless painting, Boy With Apple which, according to Gustave, they had admired together many times.  Chaos ensues as the heirs, led by Madame Ds son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody) along with his henchman, Jopling (Willem Dafoe), try to reclaim what they believe is rightfully the familys.  The film is full of fabulously quirky observations such as when Gustave views the dead body of Madame D, examines her nail polish and expresses approval for the new color because even in death, style and elegance are paramount.

My favorite line in the movie is Gustaves, spoken during a moment when he and the Lobby Boy are trying to puzzle out the mystery behind the dilemma Gustave finds himself in:

 The plot thickens, as they say.  Why, by the way? Is it a soup metaphor?

I absolutely will not tell you what mess they are in as the film is all to methodical to spoil, but I will say that I frequently laughed out loud throughout the movie.  Andersons usual themes of abandonment, trouble with authority, and overarching loyalty in the face of adversity are all present.  The cast goes on and on: Harvey Keitel, Ed Norton, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and a host of others makes this film feel like summer camp for A-Listers  The Grand Budapest Hotel is not for everyone.  My mother thought it was weird, but shes 80 and subtle, facetious humor is often lost on her.  Me, I thought it was brilliant.",1426377600,2,4063,4.690140845070423

If you don't like it within the first 15-20 minutes, turn it off.  Just because you already paid for it, don't assume you should sit it out.  It will not get better for you.  Clearly some people love it, but for those of us who hated it, run while you can.  Funny, absurd, quirky...I generally like any or all of those in a movie, but this one just didn't cut it for me, not by a long shot.  And the occasional graphic (tho quick) violent scenes were completely unnecessary.  Also not sure why so many so-called stars were in it, with varying degrees of time on the screen.  Were they friends of the writer/director/producer and they all just thought it would be fun to do something together?  Were these guys finding work harder to come by these days?  As my husband said, it all just seemed so self-indulgent.  I don't usually use the word hate for anything, but I truly hated this movie...and wish -- like I'm recommending others do -- that we had in fact turned it off when we first looked at each other and said ""maybe this is one of those movies it just takes a while to get into the rhythm"".

It is 'unique' only if you are very young to film( say 20 and younger). I appreciate the movie for what it was trying to do. Farce is a viable film concept that has been used since film began. And if you like Farce (theater of the absurd and ridiculous) than I strong recommend a few titles from the 60s: ""Those Magnificent Men and their Flying Machines"" ""The Great Race"" ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" ""Doctor Strange love""(which isn't really a farce, but has farcical moments)  and Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate in ""The Fearless Vampire Killers.""  These movies are truly funny with a story and fine performances.

Believe me. The Grand Budapest Hotel falls way short of the titles mentioned above, and is not, alas ""Unique"".",1425600000,8,832,4.684931506849315

Rushmore and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou are just a couple of fav's. In the unlikely event you have not yet seen or enjoyed one of his films do give them a look-see. You may also be interested to know, he is sometimes joined in the writing of these wild tales by Owen Wilson.",1425254400,2,391,4.226666666666667

687367,5,6303482295,"Anderson's eighth film is by far his most ambitious. Aside from an ensemble cast that continues to grow, he also takes on the murder mystery genre, offering a childlike sense of mayhem. Plus, he maneuvers through three time periods to tell the rollicking and wild story of Gustave H, concierge of the titular hotel as well as one of the most fascinating heroes Anderson has yet created.
There is a reason the movie was nominate for an Oscar.
Highly recommended",1425168000,,460,4.7625
687368,5,6303482295,"Apparently, I'm not the only one that likes this movie as it won several Academy Awards.  That said, this movie will probably not be to everyone's taste, but try it.  It is a comedy of dry humor and makes no pretense about being reality, per se.  The sets are wonderful, however, and makes the movie in many ways.  The hotel is a character in and of itself.  Several cameos by well known stars assist in making this movie a humorous, farcical romp.  I won't go into details about plot and story as it might ruin it for potential viewers.  I will say that it is set in a fictitious Eastern European country on the eve of WWII.  If that doesn't pique your curiosity, nothing will.  Give it a look.

687480,2,6303482295,"I can't help but say that I didn't see anything special. I didn't think this movie really had a point and it gets tangled up in a confusing plot and too many characters. At the end, I wasn't even sure we found out who the murderer was. The only two characters who were well developed were Gustave and Zero. Even Zero was underdeveloped in my opinion, all we find out about him is that he was a refugee and a new lobby boy who was a foreigner. I was also rather disappointed at the romance between the girl and Zero. It could've been well developed and could've let Ronan's fate pack a real emotional punch but it didn't. That being said, there are things I liked about the film. It is very quirky and the acting is very good. Ralph Fiennes gives a good performance which should be one of the only things that this film was nominated for an Oscar for. The young man who plays Zero is also very good. The production design of this film is also very good and so is the cinematography.

He doesnt have a bad movie in my opinion, and im sure people could argue up and down which are their favorites.  these are just mine so if you like this movie, try one of the other 3 i listed and i think youll enjoy them!

Happy Watching!",1424995200,2,571,4.136363636363637

688348,2,6303482295,It was visually interesting which shows why it won only visual awards.  The movie was void of any emotional content - flat and vacant - it was as if Mel Brooks (there were some groaners and silliness) and a German clockmaker collaborated.,1424822400,7,238,4.666666666666667

688350,2,6303482295,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", Wes Anderson's most successful film to date, is visually enthralling, every frame a veritable art museum painting (and not just on the level of ""Boy with Apple""), cleverly utilizing glass-paintings and CGI-enhanced locations in Germany and Poland actually to the level of picture postcards.  That may also be its problem.  As interesting as the film would seem to be theoretically, it seems as hollow and superficial as a picture postcard. Its extraordinary cast members (which includes 11 previous Oscar nominees and 5 Oscar winners) posture themselves like mannequins throughout a fast-paced exercise that feels no deeper than an elaborate puppet show.  Admittedly, I've had a long-term aversion to Anderson's 'style', so annoying in its contrived stance of false naivet&eacute;.  While overwhelmed by the beauty in every sequence; I search in vain for the least empathy with a single character and any emotion beyond the superficial.  Many swoon over this film, but its adoration to me makes more sense on a sociological level in sync with the Twitter and Instagram sound-bite age we live in. As I said to a good friend (who's a Wes Anderson fan) after we left the theater, ""How could anyone spend so much money on such a marvelous cast and such gorgeous images and produce something so shallow and emotionless?""  I'm still waiting for the answer.",1424822400,27,1378,5.129464285714286

690120,4,6303482295,"Wes Anderson knows how to serve up a souffl of delight,like a manic pixie who's run amuck in a weird rationalist universe full of crazy people. In his latest offering he develops the Eastern European world of Zubrowka between the two wars, set in a famous European hotel,run by the legendary concierge, Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), who does everything with pin-point precision,and caters to his clientele of elderly, wealthy ladies,with great charm and aplomb. They all fall in love with him and usually have sex. Gustave services his clientele's needs like he's keeping 10 plates all spinning in the air. His most trusted friend is Zero Mostafa(Tony Revelori), a refugee and lobby boy, who takes notes and imbibes the lessons of his mentor. He is attracted to Agatha (Saorirse Ronan),who works in the patisserie,

Everybody we encounter appears extremely eloquent,explaining the workings of the narrative as they go along. We are introduced to the story by an older writer,who goes back to his younger self(Jude Law).The film, dedicated to another writer,Stefan Zweig,uses a frame and flashback structure like his. This central European writer wrote of a charmed universe,whose progress and comforts seemed unassailable. But already,this Europe was being invaded by fascism and the rise of the Nazis,then later derailed by war. Zweig became an migr casualty. Anderson hasgathered together an ensemble cast of leading Hollywood actors,who all play a cameo role in a screwball comedy: Norton, Schwartzman,Brody,Wilson,Dafoe,Murray,Abraham,Keitel,Goldblum ,Swinton,Amalric. Anderson depicts a vanished world sustained by grace, a fairytale vision of a cosmopolitan world. Fiennes walks the line between courtliness and vulgarity,displaying a gift for comic timing never before seen. The convoluted plot comes second to the thrill and ingenuity of the ride.

M.Gustav is on the run with his teenage lobby-boy sidekick Zero after inheriting a priceless painting from `friend' Madame D(Swinton),who has been bumped off by her greedy son Dimitri(Brody).Aided by his henchman (Dafoe) and a band of Nazi soldiers(led by Norton).This is a co-written original script and together with set and costume design and musical score(tremendously zippy) are all up with a good chance at the Oscars. Many people may find this film too high in confected cutesiness, but the WWII backdrop brings a new dimension of tragedy. There is also an element of film noir in the murder of Kovacs(Goldblum) by Dimitri in the galleries of a museum. The film has been storyboarded meticulously, the screenplay has great wit and charm,the pace industriously planned,the scenarios opulently infused with artifice,Anderson has marshalled the power of an ensemble cast,pulling off a magnificent feat of artistry.",1424390400,,2772,5.504694835680751

I did see a number of ratings calling it boring. I was amazed! If you think it's boring, your range of interests may be somewhat . . . circumscribed. Or you may lack ability to follow a more convoluted plot. This is the kind of movie that requires thought, or at least the ability to hang onto the details of a few plot twists. It's not the kind of film that does all the intellectual work for you.

The are a lot of twists and turns along the way that make it a good story.  The dialogue is witty and delivered at a fast pace, it takes a moment to get used to.  There are interesting camera angles and techniques, some old techniques but work really well here.  I liked the sets and costumes were a nice touch. .

The acting was good especially with headliner Ralph Fiennes, who played the legendary concierge of the Grant Budapest Hotel.  Lots of familiar faces makes cameos and play very strange characters.  Those faces even briefly added to the fun of the film:  Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Ed Norton, William Dafoe, Jude Law, and Jeff Goldblum of the most notable though there are more you'll surely recognize.

The movie as a whole is pretty good once you get used to the dialogue and the way they cut it in the editing room.  It's funny though, it has a dry wit about it, and there are lots of dry humorous moments leaning on absurdity throughout.  Overall, it's a fun, and quick movie (around 90 minutes).  They didn't waste any time in there.  I'd call it the little weird funny movie that could.",1424044800,,1220,4.490909090909091

I still haven't seen Bottle Rocket, and my one viewing of The Darjeeling Limited was unfavorable, 2.5* out of 5, but the rest of his filmography is great (Rushmore 4*, The Royal Tenenbaums 4.5*, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou 4*, Fantastic Mr. Fox 4.5*, Moonrise Kingdom 4.5*) and The Grand Budapest Hotel follows suit (4.5*).

It's beautifully shot & cleverly written. I love how the story folds back onto itself with 3 (or perhaps even 4) different times, each with their own aspect ratio.  Fiennes is brilliant as Gustave and should have been nominated for an Oscar. A lot of the Anderson regulars show up, even if they're only present for a short cameo, but it's great when they pop up. A shame Boyhood or Birdman will probably steal Best Picture and Inarritu will probably steal Best Director.  Anderson has been batting a pretty amazing average.  He has a very distinct style and you always know when you're watching one of his films (which may be an issue for the older Academy members) but I really wish he could get some recognition this year by winning something (perhaps the Best Writing Oscar).

691365,1,6303482295,"The trailer looked hilarious, and so we went to see it, in an actual theatre, even though Wes Anderson is a terrible filmmaker and everyone knows it. There wasn't much else to see at the time, and I thought anyone can have a good day, so why not?  Anderson has connections, with loads of money to make a film and actors who are keen to show how cool they are and appear in his films, but he hasn't got an idea or a plot to hang it all on. And it sure shows here. His style is: It's funny when actors deadpan, face-forward into the camera and deliver their lines with no feeling; it's hilarious when the plot is a cartoon, but moving at a snail's pace. Critics love him, because he's just so cool.  He apparently knows a lot of people who think his clique is cool and involve themselves in his debacles. But I--and everybody I know, in and out of show business --think he is as boring as hell. You have to be desperate for entertainment to think much of this particular film. It is not just boring. It is slow and terribly tedious. The actors are not acting; they are imitating cartoons and are boring. The script is a cartoon. As you can tell, I am hostile, because the trailer duped me into seeing the film, and the trailer was much funnier and better than the movie. When Ralph Fiennes turns and runs in the trailer, it was funny. When he does it in the movie, it wasn't. Maybe that was because the set-up wasn't right or funny, or maybe by then my eyes were glazed over from watching the pointless and unfunny film. The Three Stooges are much more amusing. For mindless, but intelligent entertainment, watch old Marx Brothers movies. Anderson may aspire to that--Who knows?--but, if so, he fails miserably.

More goofy than ""clever"". But for some reason the cartoonish characters, sight gags and campy dialog just didn't tickle my funnybone.

692052,4,6303482295,"Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is another winner in his impressive directing cannon.  Like much of his previous work the film is a dark comedy.  Told in a double flashback from a writer (Tom Wilkinson) in 1985 who remembers how he learned the story of his book (same as the film's title) from the former lobby boy Zero now owner of the hotel in 1968 (F. Murray Abram as Zero, Jude Law as the writer) of his adventures with the former concierge (Ralph Fiennes) in 1932.  It is a caper involving murder, theft of artwork, escape from prison and the impending war.  The rest of the cast is made up of cameos from the usual Wes Anderson troupe including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Edward Norton, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody as well as Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum and Tilda Swinton among others.  Mr. Fiennes basically carries the film on his shoulders appearing in the majority of the scenes.  He pompous, effite and absolutely brilliant as M. Gustave.  Newcomer Tony Revolori is not quite up to Mr. Fineness high standards, but he does a nice job in his first major role.  Mr. Anderson's films are definitely an acquired taste and if you don't like his previous work then this one will not likely change your opinion of his work.  But for devotees, The Grand Budapest Hotel vaults to the top of his best of list right beside Rushmore.",1423353600,,1358,4.648535564853557

692054,4,6303482295,We enjoyed the movie but it doesn't live up to the hype.  It's a very interesting story but too much like a Charlie Chaplin slapstick approach.,1423353600,,143,4.5
692055,2,6303482295," Grand Hotel Budapest  is certainly a colourful, lively and entertaining movie.  However, potential viewers should be warned that it is not particularly funny. Indeed, it is rather depressing given the hotels demise over a few decades, which we are told (not shown) leads to its demolition.

Congruent with the cinematography, the convoluted plot and one-dimensional characters are worthy of comic book stuff.  The conclusion to the movie is somewhat abrupt, almost as if the writers has run out of inspiration  or the producers of money.

The cast of numerous actors (and surprisingly few actresses) is impressive but most have very small parts. The choice of actors itself is debatable in many cases. For instance, it is hard to fathom what could justify the total lack of physical or moral similarity between the young Zero Mustapha and the older played by F. Murray Abraham, who in any case is much too old for a character who should be about 50 years of age. Also, Ralph Fiennes strangely acts in the style of Johnny Depp, who apparently was initially considered for the role.

Overall, this diverting movie should be seen as just that and nothing more.",1423353600,,1158,4.93298969072165

692197,5,6303482295,"If you have not heard of Wes Anderson, I highly urge you to look him up right now. Stop whatever you're doing, google his works, and let yourself be captivated by his artistic vision. He is that good.

Wes Anderson is a filmmaker who has made eight feature films in which he directs, produces, writes, and even sometimes acts. His unique whimsical style has earned him prestigious awards for directing and screenwriting (Academy Awards for best screenplay for The Royal Tenenbaums, 2001 and Moonrise Kingdom, 2012, best animated feature for Fantastic Mr. Fox, 2009 and best feature film and best director for The Grand Budapest Hotel, 2014).

The filmmakers works display his eccentric narrative style. His movies first person narration along with evocative color schemes and poetic dialogues make Anderson one of the most imaginative filmmakers of this generation.  Anderson is unapologetically original and expresses an inventive vision.

Andersons eighth and most current film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is his best one yet. The film is set in 1932 in the fictional nation of Zubrowska, an eastern European country, in the middle of a geopolitical conflict. The Grand Budapest Hotel follows the adventures of Monsieur Gustave, the concierge of a prestigious hotelthe namesake of the movieand the hotels lobby boy, Zero. The film is centered on the characters mentor/mentee relationship as they escape death, find love, and inherit more money than both of them can imagine.

The film is representation of Wes Andersons quirky imagination, and his consistent narrative style made me feel like Im listening to an audiobook accompanied by moving pictures. The film embraces nostalgia as it recollects a not-so-distant Eastern Europe. Wes Anderson recounts a conflicted time in history but fictionalizes it into a comedic story introducing characters as eccentric as its backdrop.

The color scheme is one my favorite aspects of The Grand Budapest Hotel. The vibrancy of the pastels adds to its quirkiness and whimsy. The hotels pink and purple hues represent opulence and goes well with the exaggeration and the fantasy the film tries to tell.

Also, the films set design and costume design is nothing short of superb. They are so visually and aesthetically pleasing that every scene could be a painting. Nothing looks out of place. Every single little detail is carefully thought out resulting in a masterpiece of sequences and scenes.

I also like how Anderson laid out the films storyline. M. Gustave and Zeros story is told in a flashback. But unlike other films that use flashbacks, The Grand Budapest Hotel goes back from the past to the present so smoothly that the audience would have an easy time knowing what it is going on. The film is easy to comprehend, and Andersons visual artistry helps in captivating the audience.

The film stars Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Saoirse Ronan, and Adrien Brody among other magnificent actors.
The Grand Budapest Hotel has won several esteemed awards including Academy Awards for best motion picture of the year, best director, best screenplay, best cinematography, best editing, best production design, best costume design, best makeup and hairstyling and best in music (original score).

The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic film, and I highly recommended it for everyone. If you think you would like The Grand Budapest Hotel, I also recommend the rest of Andersons films and The Virgin Suicides, directed and written by Sofia Coppola based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides.",1423094400,,3552,5.183246073298429

Only with the recent multiple Oscar nominations of this movie, I decide to give it a chance. And guess what: it is a great movie, his best since the Royal Tennenbaums. Set mostly in the 1930s in a fictional Central European state (the film was mostly shot in Southern Germany) - though with a nifty introduction from the 1960s that frames the narrative with Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham - the Grand Hotel Budapest tells the story of the said hotel - one in the classical European style - that is run by the concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) helped by the bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori)

Fiennes is great as Gustave, a cultured, suave womanizer specialized in wooing elderly ladies who sees himself as a beacon of civilization in an age of increasing barbarism. When one of his ""customers"" (Tilda Swinton) dies and decides to give part of her inheritance to Mustafa, her two psycho sons (Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe) will left no stone unturned in trying not to give others what they think is rightfully theirs.

This movie has an impressive all star cast. Along with those already named, we also have Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keite, Saoirse Ronan, Mathieu Amalric and (in smaller roles), Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzmann.

693177,2,6303482295,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Wes Anderson is back at it again with another one of his quirkfests, this time entirely convincing most critics that he's crafted a masterpiece. Most are mesmerized by the production design, which truly deserves an Academy Award. Anderson opted to use miniatures for wide shots of the hotel and did extensive research for the interiors. The Grlitzer Warenhaus, a defunct German department store which survived World War II, was a stand-in for the Grand Budapest's lobby. Anderson's cinematography, which features all kinds of shots from unusual angles was probably another reason the critics were so impressed with the film (take note of the prison escape scene in particular). But I believe critic Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gets it right when she concludes that Anderson's narrative, is wholly one-note in nature: ""This meticulously appointed doll house of a movie just went on and on, making me want to smash many miniature plates of plaster food in frustration.""

The narrative begins when a famous author in 1985 recounts a visit he made to the then decaying Grand Budapest Hotel in 1968; he then met the owner, Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who recounts his days as a lobby boy at the hotel in 1932. The hotel is located in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a remnant of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. One is reminded of the Marx Brother's take on their own fictional Balkan Republic, ""Freedonia,"" but alas in Anderson's ""homage,"" there are no laughs!

Ralph Fiennes plays M. Gustave, the concierge at the hotel, who takes Zero, the young lobby boy (who is the narrator of the story in his old age), under his wing. Gustave, an admitted bisexual, has been having a very brief affair with the elderly owner of the hotel, ""Madame D,"" who soon dies under mysterious circumstances. She bequeaths a rare painting, ""Boy with Apple,"" which enrages the Madame's son, Dmitri (Adrian Brody), who insists Gustave is not entitled to it. Despite Dmitri's opposition, Gustave steals the painting anyway (aided by Zero), and returns it to the Grand Budapest Hotel, where he places it in the hotel safe. Gustave makes Zero his heir, in return for his help.

The Madame's secretary, Serge X, is forced into accusing Gustave of murdering the old lady and Gustave ends up in prison. Gustave remarks that he earned the respect of hardened criminals by ""beating the s*** out of one of them for challenging his ""virility."" To make a long story short, Gustave digs his way out of prison using tools hidden in cakes baked by Zero's fiance, Agatha. He and Zero are pursued by an assassin hired by Dmitri, Jopling (William Dafoe) who ends up murdering Serge. Jopling gets his comeuppance at the hands of Zero, who pushes him off a cliff. If this isn't enough, there's also a gunfight with Dmitri and the discovery of a second will inside the painting, proving Gustave's innocence.

The reason, most of this hokum isn't funny, is because Anderson's antagonists are unlikeable. Take for example Dmitri--when he first encounters Gustave he calls him a ""fagg-t"" and slaps him in the face. While Anderson attempts to lighten the scene up when other characters start hitting each other in the face, the damage cannot be undone: Dmitri remains an unpleasant villain throughout. In real farce, we experience the outrage without the consequences. But there are consequences aplenty when Serge is murdered up at the rectory. Even Gustave's death during the epilogue, at the hands of those fascist-like soldiers on the train, sounds the wrong note for a film that should be light-hearted (just like ""Duck Soup""). And why all those anachronistic expletives throughout the movie? Why must the elegant Gustave say things that he beat the ""s***"" out of that prisoner? Anderson relies on these out-of-character remarks, to obtain a few cheap laughs.

Dana Stevens wonders in Slate Magazine, what Anderson is really trying to say here: ""As played with a melancholy rakishness by the handsomer-than-ever Fiennes, M. Gustave is one of Anderson's more memorable creations--but he's stranded in a movie that, for all its gorgeous frills and furbelows (including a lush musical score by Alexandre Desplat and a surfeit of charming cameos from Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman, Ed Norton, and Bill Murray), never seemed to me to be quite sure what it was about. Youth, age, rivalry, and mentorship? Nostalgia for a lost way of life? The ineluctable slaughterhouse of 20th-century European history? These are big, dark themes, ideas that the director (who also wrote the screenplay, with a story assist from his friend Hugo Guinness) seems both obsessed by and game to explore. But somehow Anderson never quite lets himself (or his characters, or by extension, us) get to the deepest, darkest places those paths might lead."" Stevens gets it right when she concludes that with Anderson ""everything remains in that familiar register of chilly, stylish remove.""

Ultimately, one can never care for any of Anderson's characters. They are written intentionally not to be taken seriously. Take Agatha and her death from ""the Prussian Grippe."" Not only does Agatha die but so does her infant son. Agatha is supposed to be one of the sympathetic characters, but here Anderson bumps her off too with a cheap aside.

Why do so many people find Anderson's vision so enchanting? Perhaps it's the pleasure they feel when his quirky misfits triumph over a coterie of reactionaries (as the evil Dmitri fails to deprive Gustave of his inheritance). Underneath all the slapstick, is standard melodrama (the bad guys getting their comeuppance), mixed with a touch of black humor. In the Anderson oeuvre, there's a lot to see, but he has hardly anything to say.",1421712000,4,5765,5.023012552301255

I decided to see what David Thomson had to say about it.  Something about ""Grand Budapest Hotel""--perhaps the sense of the story's ""life,"" if any, stemming less from character and action than the director's forced infusions of energy into a collection of stylized ""set pieces""--this told me that Thomson might share my general feeling about the film's cartoonish shallowness. The long-time New Republic critic, in fact, savages the film, calling it decadently, overwhelmingly shallow-- sweet enough to overcome any diabetics among its audience: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116871/wes-andersons-grand-budapest-hotel-reviewed.  So what does that prove? That there's more than one of us?  That misery loves company?  That we're ""a swell lot of thieves""?  Yes, yes, and yes.  But that doesn't excuse the film's intolerant supporters from defending their rating.  What's the point of the film?  Is possible to be caught up in Ralph Fiennes' performance in ""The English Patient"" (one of the screen's most passionate and memorable lovers, down to the necrophilia that he shares with Bronte's incomparable Heathcliff) and equally impressed by his performance in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel""?  I'm not condemning Hotel Budapest, but If I'm slow in booking a long stay at the hotel, I merely ask that its champions at least explain why it deserves the Michelin Guide's highest rating.

""The Darjeeling Limited"" struck me as a comedic yet penetrating study of family relations while providing accurate tabeaux of modern India and satiric commentary on spiritual quests. And at the instant of forsaking their quest, the brothers appear to find meaning in it.  ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" certainly bears the mark of the same ""auteur,"" but in the end it doesn't deliver the goods.  Especially as my life and remaining time increasingly decrease, my requirements, or criteria, invariably go beyond ""mere entertainment""--whether narrative fiction, theater, music or film. At this point, I return to the ""classics,"" and almost invariably I discover why they've earned that title and why, after 50 to 100 years, they still remain relevant and inexhaustible.  By contrast, most of the time-filling film fare of the present tends to be lost and forgotten virtually overnight.

If ""Grand Hotel Budapest"" is life-altering experience for you (as a great film should be) that's great, but why not help the rest of us reach the same level of awareness. Admittedly, for some of us it's a hard sell, especially after indelible movie experiences like: Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", John Ford's ""The Searchers"" and Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries""; from more recent films like ""Nashville,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""The Elephant Man,"" ""Bringing Back the Dead,"" ""No Country for Old Men""; from silent masterpieces like ""City Lights""; or, somewhat later, ""Swing Time,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" ""Tokyo Story,"" ""24 Eyes,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Apocalypse Now.""  Each of these works was for me a rewarding labor of love, as measured by the extra twinge of excitement that suddenly, and without preparation, seized me, allowing me to realize the sense and meaning of it all.  It's an epiphany, perhaps better described as a moment of self-recognition, and I'm let down by any work of art that doesn't, and maybe can't, deliver this tremor of exhilaration--a tingling that amounts to a manifestation of the invisible, or of the spiritual, in the spectator's physical, or optical-aural, field of vision.

Perhaps 30-40 years ago, you will be less excited by particular films because they don't measure up to ""Grand Hotel Budapest.""  (In that case, ""Grand Hotel Budapest"" has gone beyond ""greatness"" to ""classic"" status.  But for me (and Thomson) Anderson's ""Grand Hotel Budapes"" simply doesn't seem to aspire to such immortality.  At present the film still strikes me as an artificial star on top of  a meticulously designed, brightly lit-up and colorfully decorated Christmas Tree (which reminds me that mine is overdue to come down).",1421539200,2,4440,5.293447293447294

Location, Location, Location! But of what? The Boy With Apple painting? That MacGuffin should have been at least akin to modern abstract, as to avoid distraction in comparison with renowned masterpieces. The painting appeared rank amateur and found it wanting for such a coveted prize.

Now onto that pastry! It looked so succulent and mouthwatering, I have never seen a comparable creation, it would provide immense gratification after enduring this film. I was rather bored for the most part and when pastry items ignite my interest, it does not bode well for a great review.

I was unaware of the plot, script, actors involved, or reviews, so went in with an objective mindset. I was astounded with the number of high profile talent appearing in surprising roles that, after the aforementioned pastry, I anticipated who would show up next. I recently watched Ed Norton in ""Fight Club"" and seeing him dressed in gestapo gear provided some much needed hilarity! The beautiful vistas from precarious positions were breathtaking and filled many weary scripted scenes.

I imagine that a significant portion of the budget was dedicated to talent which translates to an insufferable script. The directing was plodding and predictable but hard to hit all four cylinders in this type of ""I already knew who done it"" farce.

Recommend for notorious compilation of similar scripts with a new twist: include every A-Lister alive and voila, exasperating formula!",1421539200,3,1494,5.1570247933884295

The acting was a hoot.  Numerous name brand actors were involved with the making of this film.  Whether they be long in the story or not, each aided the movie along in a way that was needed.  Remember, The Society of the Crossed Keys may be your best friend.

Bottle Rocket, The Darjeeling Limited, and The Life Aquatic weren't my cups of tea really for some reason. I thought this one might fall into the latter camp, but I thought it was a blast overall. Really rich with detail in every scene with plenty of the quirk and charm you'd expect from Anderson's best work.

It is a funny and sad film with a number of silly events that did not detract from the overall humor, such as banging on a door and when it is not opened, going back some feet, rushing the door to knock it open, which is opened by the person inside as the runner reaches it, and he continues his run through the room and out a window. This silly act was done by such clowns as the Marx brothers. There were similar silly acts when the five prisoners were escaping such as how they act when they are seen by the guards. There were silly statements such as when one of the escaping prisoner stabs a guard who had previously stabbed him and both die: ""I guess this was a draw.""

It is lush and filled with color and lavish design. The story is fully developed and the characters are written with depth and distinction...right down to the evil sisters who barely speak, and the soft-hearted prisoners; each person is a unique and necessary part of the storyline. The CG, the production, art, and set design are a revelation, as is the animation. It is filled with poignancy and deft humor. Anderson's quirky, odd characters are fully and richly brought to life with his oft-used set of actors, who are filled with imagination. Tilda Swinton is fabulous and I didn't even recognize Harvey Keitel at first. Jude Law is a terrific narrator, Abrams is wonderful, and Tony Revolori as Zero is a perfect sidekick to Ralph Fienne's Gustave. This is Wes at his best, as are each and every one of the actors; Adrian Brody and Willem Defoe play apt villains against Jeff Goldblum's serious barrister; classic Wes Anderson! I loved it!

694305,5,6303482295,"Wes Anderson's whimsical tale is front and center ingenuous, light-hearted, humorous and subtly deep. Fiennes has amazing comic timing, supported by Anderson's regulars from Moonrise Kingdom which include fine actors from Edward Norton as the fascist captain, to Bill Murray as one of the members the secret society of concierges across Europe. Stylistically, Anderson's scenes of the hotel evoke a cream puff ethereal and heavenly Grand Budapest and environs sported by pink hues suggesting the fanciful. Contrasted with this loveliness are the train scenes in browns and greys that evoke the gritty reality of fascism that is overtaking Europe and continually threatens to overtake human minds anywhere. From music to cinematography to editing and pacing, the film is a gem and coheres reflecting humanity as it is and humanity as it should be, the villains paintbrush strokes that are strangely real, the hero Gustav and Zero, his lobby boy, broader strokes of brilliance and always humorous. Beautifully acted, memorable and unusual, in the pantheon of Anderson's work...it is floating on a cloud toward the top of the heap.",1420156800,4,1128,5.342696629213483

Ralph Fiennes is absolutely outstanding and hilarious, playing Gustave, the hotel concierge and a lady's man who's somewhat of a dandy falsely accused of murder. Harvey Keitel as a master criminal, Adrian Brody as the son who frames the concierge for murder over a piece of art, Jeff Goldblum as the attorney for the estate ...

694816,4,6303482295,"Either you will like it or not, either you will get it or not it can be hard to grasp this film. Some people just won't get it. I loved it, I though it was hilarious. It's hard to find films to compare it to. To give you an idea it's a bit like the movie Clue in that its a comedy and murder mystery. Then again it's a little like Spy's like us in that 2 sort of bumbling fools try and out run both the bad guys and the police. It's one of those movies you just have to experience for yourself. You must give it a chance at times it can be a bit slow but for me it kept my interest and once the chase begins it really starts rolling. There's twists and turns and sub plots to keep you entertained. Having said all that, I can see where some just won't get it. It's like the movie Spinal Tap, either you get it and fall on the floor laughing or you will say what the heck is this crap. The cover and the title are a bit misleading as the hotel doesn't have a lot to do with the film. Yes the hotel is a vital part but its not like The Shining where the hotel has a lot to do with it. Most of the movie takes place outside the hotel. In other word, I thought this was a film about a hotel and the goings on with in it. Wrong. It's really about the lives of the 2 main characters. This film is what I would call dry humor and the longer you watch t the funnier it gets. Yes, definitely buy this film it's funny for sure but it's so much more than that. You got to pay attention or you might easily miss the humor aspect. I's dry and a bit deep I'd compare it to Faulty towers and maybe a little Monty Python like. Like I said it's different, hard to put your finger on it but the movie Fink comes to mind. The William Dafoe character seems perfectly cast. OK after writing this review I want to go watch it again.

694985,5,6303482295,"Who would have guessed the ideas for this preposterously hilarious film came form the seeds within Stefan Zweig's mind? Well, Wes Anderson is the man about wild ideas and he surpasses his own impressive credits (Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Royal Tenebaums, Rushmore, etc) with this zany and delightful romp.

GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL recounts the adventures of Gustave H (Ralf Fiennes, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the wars, and Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune -- all against the backdrop of a suddenly and dramatically changing Continent. The big-time cast includes Mathieu Amalric, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Soarise Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban and others.

Granted, you must be in a good state of mind to get all the innuendos and in-jokes that fly through this film, but go along for the ride. It is gorgeous to look at, has glorious musical score by Alexandre Desplat, and makes of an evening of escapist fun. Grady Harp, December 14",1419724800,3,1328,5.1720930232558135

696085,1,6303482295,"The only Wes Anderson film I've cared to finish thanks to letting friends pick the movie, it's yet another example of a filmmaker apt to apply the word ""auteur"" to themselves. While Anderson's style is lauded as unique, this late attempt yet still stink of a film student trying to figure out what style is through making the same movie over and over again, narrative swopped to distract from this reality, until they get it right. The Grand Budapest is an easy format: old hotel, a desire to save it, a couple love narratives with a few echoed elements, attempts to poke fun at colonialism, ""adolescence is just so darn awkward"" themes coupled with ""this is how to be a man"" themes, totally not Nazis - shenanigans ensue. It's fun if you're easily distracted by confusing mall floor plans, but I'd recommend skipping it if you want something genuine and thought provoking rather than an unsteady, misfiring allegory for WWII.",1418342400,3,926,4.79375

I liked it, though. It reminded me of Roman Polanski's Fearless Vampire Killers from 1967. It has that kind of nothing-taken-seriously ambiance and mad-cap (we used to say ""mad-cap"" in 1967) chase scenes that one associates with those kinds of camp movies. The Grand Budapest is stylish, beautiful to watch, thinks it has a plot but doesn't.

Watch it for the visuals and the unlikely folks cast in roles that defy description. Be ready for that look from your spouse, though, that says . . . .""Really?""",1418342400,,742,4.529850746268656

697872,3,6303482295,"Was really looking forward to this film, since I'm a big Wes Anderson fan.

Unfortunately it falls flat in many areas. While the characters and setting are strong, there is no reason to care about anything that happens. The formatting of the story makes the plot points fairly predictable (since it's done as a flashback, and you already know who is still alive by the ""end""). This robs the story of a lot of suspense, which is a shame as it would otherwise be a more interesting drama/mystery film.

A few plots are wrapped up in wholly unsatisfactory ways, which was a bigger gripe. The fact that TWO major characters die off screen as an aside is inexcusable. ""Oh by the way, that person died... no reason to give'em a send-off even though you're super attached to them by the end"" is terrible storytelling.",1415577600,5,810,4.618055555555555

697876,5,6303482295,"If you appreciate the many aspects of filmmaking then you are sure to love this movie on at least one or two - if not a dozen - levels.  The story is wonderful!  The characters are wonderful!  The costumes, the locations, the staging, the cinematography... All wonderful!  But the art direction is where this movie truly shines... It is as close to watching moving artwork as I've ever seen.  Every shot is meticulously composed.  Admittedly, it is a quirky film full of quirky characters - as much of Wes Anderson's live action work has been - but here he is clearly at his directing peak.  And, of course, Bluray is the way to see such a visual masterpiece.  This movie is absolutely on my top ten list of recent movies and very nearly in my list of top ten movies of all time (a list overflowing with the films of Welles, Capra, Huston, Wilder, Sturges, Hitchcock and Allen).  This film may not be as ""old school"" as the others but it clearly exhibits the same mastery of the art of filmmaking.

Confusing. Frenetic. Dizzying. Pointless. Stupid. Plotless. Lacking one character to root for.

I waited for Bill Murray to save this turkey but found he had a barely cameo role and probably never saw the rest of the script, if there was one. I wonder how much money he grabbed for speaking a line or two.

His sets---both large and small, the impeccable wardrobes, and the amazing miniatures---provide an initial giddy rush, but soon become cloying and overwhelming, like a flavored coffee.

The actors, and what a broad ranges of folks show up in this film, seem to be walking through sets and stages, performing for the camera more than for the audience and seem distant and separate to the point that it looks like they are standing still while the backgrounds change behind them.

The whole thing is magical genius....the writing, the production, the casting, the acting.  At the movie's start, I wasn't sure it was my cup of tea, almost shut it off, but decided to give it a little time-- boy am I glad I did.

I have to add, Ralph Fiennes is amazing-- what a gift.  He brings his character to life, touching the viewer into such a range--and not just touching in, but inspiring us to spend time there.  I loved him in Constant Gardener as well.  Anderson's script in a lesser actor's hands would have fallen flat, but Fiennes makes it sing.  Anderson has an incredible way with juxtaposing human wisdom and folly, ego/id/superego, and Fiennes' timing/delivery and facial expressiveness carried it inimitably.",1413849600,,879,4.8133333333333335

And, while I'm a huge fan of the unique creative eccentricity of the Coen Brothers, I initially thought this film was trying too hard to be 'quirky'.  As a matter of fact, throughout most of the film I kept thinking ""Here's someone trying to be another Joel or Ethan Coen"".  But I'm glad I stuck with it.

This film IS contrived, and quirky, and at times just ridiculous (as in the ski chase scene), but that's okay.  It ultimately does a beautiful job of balancing a dash of ridiculousness with generous doses of humor, pathos, and a lot of heart.  In the end, after groaning a number of times during the film, but laughing even more, I actually deeply cared about the main characters and their stories, conquests and losses.

This film is a never-ending meandering of strange tale after strange tale, set in a very nearly-real make believe world.  It is the type of movie that - had I watched it back in my hippie days of experimental use of hallucinogens - I would have said ""What the ......????""  But now, I just sit back, accept it for the beautifully woven tapestry of wonderful creativity that it is, and enjoyed it.

Sure a more realistic version might have worked too but so does this.  If you liked this sort of fake looking props as part of the real world type of viewing experience, you might also want to check out the great TV series Pushing Daisies.  The only major disappointment for me though was that very little of the movie is set in the hotel, the plot revolves around primarily two characters who worked there as they journey to other places such as prison, another hotel, the mountains and others.  As someone who has formerly worked in hotels, I was looking forward to a surreal looking hotel based movie, alas that isn't what this is for long.

I did find the fact that the flashback version (most of the time) of Zero looked nothing like he did in the present, in fact he was a completely different race a bit of distraction.  Not sure if this was a deliberate visual gag but it certainly stood out.  Other than that though I found pretty entertaining, albeit a little slow at times.

700064,4,6303482295,"Wes Andersons latest cinematic confection, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a quirky, surrealistic comedy set at a mountain resort run by a concierge named M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes)  and a lobby boy named Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori), whom M. Gustave has taken under his wings to train in the art of service.

Set in a fictional country, the movie begins in 1968, when the Grand Budapest Hotel is just a shadow of its former self, having been allowed to fall into disrepair and currently inhabited by a small contingent of eccentric tenants.  One of them is a writer (Tom Wilkinson) who discovers that Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) is now the owner of the once-proud establishment. The elder Mustafa regales him with stories of an earlier time in the hotels history - the 1930s, in fact - when the palatial inn played host to only the richest and most aristocratic of occupants and guests.

Through dual-narrated flashbacks, then, Anderson weaves a smart and cheeky tale of an enduring friendship that triumphs over class division, a tale that combines wit with imagination and social commentary with visual elegance, set against the writer/directors trademarked air of heightened unreality. When he isn't fulfilling his duties as hotel concierge, the foppish M. Gustave, fastidious in manner and with a poetic quote for every occasion, offers his personal services exclusively to blond, fabulously wealthy and emotionally insecure dowagers, one of whom bequeaths to him a priceless painting upon her sudden death. This surprising turn-of-events puts him at odds with a veritable army of the deceased womans outraged relatives. This leads to a stolen art treasure, a false conviction for murder, a daring prison break and a mad race to stay one step ahead of the pursuing authorities, as M. Gustave endeavors to prove his innocence.

To enhance the dreamlike nature of the material, the look of the film is marked by whimsical art direction and ultra-stylized framing. Even the dimensions of the screen change with the time period of the story - traditional square for the scenes set in 1932 and widescreen for those that take place in 1968.

In addition to the splendid deadpan performances of Fiennes, Abraham and newcomer Revolori in the key roles, the movie provides a veritable sea of familiar faces in supporting and bit parts, many of them members of Andersons repertory company: Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Owen Wilson, among others.

The Grand Budapest Hotel finds Mr. Anderson in peak form.",1412812800,4,2581,5.087470449172577

'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is such a shaggy dog story.  There is no point, no plot, no action, nothing but vignettes that fail to illuminate, animate, but ultimately frustrate.

Hey, I like inscrutable films as much as anyone.  Dancing dwarfs in 'Twin Peaks'?  Check.  Strange doings in Alaska in 'Northern Exposure'?  Check.  Hard to follow plots in ""The French Lieutentant's Woman?  Ok!

700862,5,6303482295,"A magnificent new world is, once again, created by magician Wes Anderson. This film had me from the start, with Anderson's usual display of controlled insanity, and this MUST be his best achievement. Anderson has his own regular crew of stock performers (Murray, Balaban, Schwartzman, Swinton, Keitel, etc). Add to this the lead character, Gustav, impeccably and totally portrayed by the masterful Ralph Fiennes. I haven't been as impressed in many years.

Special mention should go to Tony Revolori, perhaps the best straight-man, while holding his own.

Anderson's manic narrative is never slow, and some of his stock characteristics are ever-present. I haven't had such a good ride in years, not to mention the downhill sled-ride.

Brilliantly written, edited and executed, not to mention excellent tongue-in-cheek performances from all of the supporting characters, this is my favorite film of the last few years.

Unfortunately, it was released too early in the year to be given serious Oscar contention, but, awards aside, I can't recommend this film highly enough. Fiennes should be nominated, as should Anderson and Best Picture.

701352,5,6303482295,"Writer and director Wes Anderson gives us his latest in a line of overtly comic and interesting fables, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". After viewing ""Rushmore"" then ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (including a handful of others in between), I thought that he couldn't possibly top his own body of work, until now.  This over-the-top entertaining adventure concerning the endeavors of the Concierge of the Grand Budapest, ""M. Gustave"" (a brilliant Ralph Fiennes), and his newly hired 'Lobby Boy', ""Zero"" (Tony Revolori) left me only wanting more. They take us on a ride into ludicrosity and the film was well worth every laugh which exudes from its obvious and also underpinning dark humor, making this my newest favorite of Anderson's wonderfully stylistic films. These two cohorts are the backbone of the adventure while this progresses slowly in time.  They anchor it with their situations that can make your ears perk up by including their hilarious and especially astute dialog.  While enjoying Anderson's films, I watch for each new actor entering into the mix and this has an abundant amount of portrayals if I was to count them all.

Beginning with a nostalgic explanation of the hotel's drab existence in the present days, before going back to the beautifully colorful hotel of the 1930's, we learnt the story of how a now adult 'Zero' Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) came to be the owner of the Grand Budapest. It is now on its last legs in popularity from back in The Hotel's heyday of the 1930's, pre-WWII. An older Zero explains why it is so dear to him while sharing the brimming tale with a young and interested writer (Jude Law).  It was a bustling and lovely establishment and one that collected many famous guests that can be spotted right away, and one which was not so obvious to me straight away.  I look forward to this with Wes Anderson; a huge cast with many different faces even if they are in small roles, they still are a part of his movies.

When we rented this film, I neither had a clue about its content nor who directed it, I hadn't even read a review about it yet.  It was immediately recognizable upon watching that this was Wes Anderson and I knew I was in for a treat.  I enjoy his unique style, the editing, the varied cast and the situations.  The side gags, which are plentiful here, and the overall humor gets under my skin every time.  I haven't seen Ralph Fiennes in such a role before and it makes this all even more so witty.  He surly doesn't first strike me as a comedic actor, but he certainly was here.  The dialog, mainly his, was great to follow and catching each of his quips was truly worth the time; twice.  Lobby Boy, ""Zero"", was his perfect straight-man and foil as he becomes M. Gustave's dearest friend, ""Valet"", and sidekick in some sneaky criminal acts and a changing world between wars.

We wind-up traveling by train to a funeral of an elderly woman that M. Gustave has had dalliances with over time as this is how he secures his side income.  While everything falls apart and the two become chased from all directions, the laughter just builds. The situations are off-the-wall and the dialog in this was razor's edge smart and quick.  No matter how jumbled the circumstances begin to get, and they do, the acting picks it all up to make something that one may begin to wonder about, it is a quite entertaining story.  Through larger than life personas, rich in gorgeous sights (Robert D. Yeoman), and interesting sound (Alexandre Desplat), the tale unfolds for you.  One just needs to go with the flow and enjoy the set decorations also to see how it all goes.  It may be a bit hard to explain, although quite easy to watch with so many things occurring all at once, especially if you are already an Anderson fan.  I appreciated the colors of the hotel, the beautiful interiors and exteriors, and the facade of it changing through time. All of the people inhabiting ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" were a strange brew.  Mainly, the great writing for the duo of M. Gustave and Zero as a team was beautifully done and a don't miss for Anderson fans especially ...",1412121600,5,4098,4.646814404432133

Maybe the people that work in hotels can appreciate it better. I must say that big stars appear in the movie but I was wondering throughout why. Their roles are really insignificant. The plot is well developed, the story is told in an interesting way, but in terms of resonance with most audiences it seems that it has a little room for that. I must say that it is a story with a sad ending, but the viewer doesn't really feel the drama that should go with that kind of story. That is why I think this is a work of art.

701970,2,6303482295,"Although I don't consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, and I can't stand Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray or any of the Wilson brothers, the reviews of this movie were distinctive enough to get it into my otherwise empty DVD rental queue - but only because there were no other movies that I actually wanted to see.

Now that I've seen it, I'm still not a Wes Anderson fan, and I still can't stand Tilda Swinton, et al - and now I also don't like people I've liked in the past, like Jason Schwartzman, Ralph Fiennes, Murray Abraham and Tom Wilkinson. Only Jude Law has emerged unscathed. Every time I see him I like him more.

Wes Anderson has legions of ardent, devoted, cult-like fans, but I'm not one of them. His stuff just bores and annoys me, and his favorite actors are among the ones I most dislike even in other directors' movies.",1411603200,2,830,4.4183006535947715

702095,2,6303482295,"Always enjoy the cinematography and how the same actors come back to play new characters.  The plot  - ok was pretty silly - but at the end just fell apart.

SPOILER

In the movie, there are two train scenes where the 'foreign' porter is attacked for lack of documents.  In the second scene near the end of the movie he pulls out the same crumpled documents for the army thugs.  What bothered us is Ralph Fiennes' character supposedly becomes very rich and important, but all his power-influence-money couldn't get this guy legal status?  Really?

I guess, maybe the underlying story is about non-status people getting discriminated against?  Or just flat out racism?  If that was the underlying thread, then giving the 'foreign' porter real documents and having him beat up anyway to show the army thugs are truly racist/discriminatory would drive home that theme more so?

Anyway, that little bit, just hung us up at the end of the movie and really bothered us.  All these details so thoughtout throughout the movie and that 'little' piece seamed like it would have changed the outcome in a big way.  If all the army thugs needed were real documents, then Ralph Fiennes character would not have died on the train...

702659,5,6303482295,"This movie is not for everyone. It is inventive, plays with perspective and delivers some very broad humor based on its own zany logic.  It is not realistic in any sense. If you have a low tolerance for ""silly,"" then give this one a miss.

I loved it.

The story opens with the meta-narrative of an older author (in 2012) narrating his memories as a young writer narrating the story told to him by the aged owner of the formerly great Grand Budapest Hotel (in 1968) who is narrating the story of his experience with the legendary M. Gustave as a youth (in 1932.) So, right there, you can see that the director is fond of overdoing ""schtick.""

Ralph Fiennes plays the great concierge M. Gustave with broad humor. Gustave is a craven, scheming womanizer, but only of wealthy octogenarians. One of his ""conquests"" dies under suspicious circumstances, landing M. Gustave in hot water and eventually in the most secure prison of the obscure Eastern European country that is on the verge of a war with a Fascist neighbor (or it is a Fascist country nearly at war with a neighbor, that was unclear, and irrelevant.)

The asides and situations were fanciful and funny. What was also entertaining was the stream of surprising cameos by famous actors, e.g., Harvey Keitel as a shirtless prisoner, Bill Murray as a helpful concierge, Jeff Goldblum as a lawyer, and William Dafoe as dedicated assassin.",1411171200,3,1390,4.75103734439834

705063,5,6303482295,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is the first film by director Wes Anderson that I've watched and I was highly impressed. This movie exceeded my expectations, not only because of the creative style but also because of the dynamic characters.

As a first-time watcher of Wes Anderson, the filming style immediately drew me in. The film's aesthetic qualities, such as tone and symmetry, captivated me more than the rollercoaster storyline.

The beginning of the film transitions between multiple time periods, drawing viewers deeper into the story. This non-linear timeline is best demonstrated as the audience is taken from a scene where a girl is reading The Grand Budapest Hotel to the author recalling how he heard the story to the author hearing the story and then finally to the story of The Grand Budapest Hotel itself.

The film continues to bounce between time periods, usually closing a scene and causing dramatic and abrupt transitions. Wes Anderson tells the story in his signature style, which is marked by sweeping long takes, dramatic symmetry, and immaculate typography.

The detail and the quality of each scene--through different camera angles and transitions on set--attracts the audiences attention despite periodic lulls in action. When I watch most films, I only concentrate on the plot, but with The Grand Budapest Hotel, I enjoyed the craftsmanship of the film just as much as I did the storyline.

A slew of talented actors made the film believable and enjoyable. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes (Gustave) and Tony Revolori (Zero) was hilarious and heart-warming. Gustave and Zero were at their best when they were bantering during their various predicaments.

One of my favorite minor characters was Dmitri, Madame D's son, played by Adrien Brody. Brody portrayed a sinister character while highlighting the character's overly dramatic tendencies. This created a layered character that enhanced the quality of each scene that he was in.

The only actor that seemed out of place was Owen Wilson, who played a hotel concierge. His presence didn't fit with the time period and his character stood out like a sore thumb. Wilson was the exception rather than the rule with the performances of big name actors.

Gustave and Zero's camaraderie throughout the movie brought an intimacy to the film and allowed a satisfying conclusion. Although the storyline was fun and interesting, the film's creative shooting style made it go from a good movie to a great movie.

I would recommend this film to anyone who loves Wes Anderson films such as Moonrise Kingdom and The Royal Tenenbaums. People who appreciate good storytellers in addition to good stories will particularly enjoy this movie. I laughed out loud at times, while at other times my heart clenched. The Grand Budapest Hotel combines the best parts of different genres: it's a lovely romance, a murder mystery, and a light-hearted comedy.",1410220800,,2907,5.154989384288747
705064,5,6303482295,"One of Wes Anderson's best movies.  I'm a huge fan of Wes Anderson's creative talent, but this one is by far one of his best yet. It holds true to his style of dark humor mixed with wit and a little drama.  I recommend this new delightful gem of a movie to everyone.",1410220800,,266,4.0
705065,5,6303482295,"I've really loved all of Wes Anderson's films-- the only one I haven't seen is the animated fox thing. In this case, Wes continues with his line of artistic, goofy highbrow films, and it has continued to get me laughing just like all the others. My favorites are still The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Moonrise Kingdom, but this is right there with them. It's hard not to compare this to the others because of Wes' continuing dedication to the focused stillness he likes his actors to use in playing characters in these amazingly skewed, bizarre worlds he envisions. I just loved this thing-- it's a dry sort of humor that almost bypasses the viewer in this case, more so than in Zissou or in Kingdom because it's played more subtly. But it is just so, so great. Highly recommended for anyone who likes their humor peculiar and off-kilter.",1410220800,3,845,4.64

I have not loved everything that Wes Anderson has done (the fox movie was lost on me) but this one was a hit. You immediately have the sense that you are watching a fable, with a fictitious place and time in history (there is enough reference to something like the SS that you know its Europe-ish and 40's ish but that's all). The wide shots of the hotel look fake and they are (its a scale model, look it up on google its an interesting read). Ralph Fiennes was amazing, darling, as Mr. Gustave, dashing even in the face of death. And his narrator, Zero, was well drawn too. The movie is worth watching for the cameo's (you will probably want to rewind the section where they invoke the keys society to see the faces). (and someone please tell me, did I see George Clooney as one of the SS guys in the shoot out in the hotel because I thought I saw him peek out from behind a door). Other WA movies have lost me with a slower pace but this one is a hit because the quirkiness is matched with a good plot movement.

It doesn't help that the TV commercials billed this as something it really wasn't. The two punchlines from the commercials are easily the funniest parts of the movie, yet, they're taken out of context in the commercials to make them actually funnier in the 30 second spot than they are in the movie. Jeff Goldbloom and Bill Murray, who appeared to be billed as playing lead roles, or at least major supporting characters, are in less than 20 minutes of the film. Owen Wilson has about 5 lines in the last 15 minutes.

And, with the sound on? Well that depends: if you're a fan of Wes Anderson's or Tim Burton's intriguingly ""left-field"" films then this is up there with the very best - whimsical, charming, brilliantly acted, and with a compellingly thought provoking undercurrent about loyalty & friendship in a lost age; if you're not, well just ignore the story's idiosyncrasies & excesses and allow yourself to revel in the stunning visual feast it serves up.",1409270400,,844,4.943661971830986
706229,5,6303482295,"Been a fan of Wes for some time now and enjoy the whimsy and leisurely unfolding of generally simple but decidedly unusual tales populated by quirky characters. I described his last movie ""Moonrise Kingdom ""as a cute movie with cute actors. This movie, while certainly more adult in theme and with more diverse adult scenes still has the elements of cuteness and whimsy that's his trademark. Of course, none of it matter if the story,  acting, cinematography, and pacing don't all fall into place. By far, I feel this is Anderson's most polished work where everything fits into place, graced by familiar actors effortlessly contributing to the successful collaboration. Fiennes, Brody, and Defoe are outstanding, and all the other guest actors are excellent also. I was especially taken by the elegance of the cinematography - warm, candy colored tapestry that just lent the perfect atmosphere to the story. It's not easy to describe these movies to the popcorn bunch, overloaded with big bang and big noise, with a perspective of good cinema limited to the next comic action character and the never ending sequels. Tell them about Wes and most of them have a blank stare on their faces. If you're one of them, you probably won't enjoy this movie but, then again, you probably won't be reading this either.",1409270400,2,1306,4.9363636363636365

His attention to detail is amazing. Like Moonrise Kingdom, the Grand Budapest Hotel creates a world that is pure fantasy but also an enhanced version of reality. Don't watch this movie with any preconceived notion of what to expect; if you haven't seen a Wes Anderson film before, it will be unlike anything you've seen.

First, you must engage in willful suspension of disbelief. Some things in the film are outlandish, but these things add key elements of comedy, drama, and depth. Second, you must be familiar with Europe and it's history. While the film takes place in a fictional place with fictional events, they are all heavily based of of 20th century Western/Eastern European conflicts. Knowing European history will let you quickly grasp the references and see what inspired the fictional things in the movie.",1408838400,2,638,4.862385321100917

707206,5,6303482295,"A Young Writer (Jude Law) passing through Europe in 1968, stays in The Grand Budapest Hotel that is almost extinct. The owner explains to the writer the history of the hotel and how he came to own it. The story covers times of war and peace. We also get an inside look at different institutions.

The details of the hotel history give structure to the movie; however the movie is really about how people treat people.

In the end credits it states that that the film was inspired by the writing of Stefan Zweig.

It took a little time thinking about the rating as The presentation style is, well let us not say unique, but rare and takes some getting used to at first.

The list of actors is a virtual who's who and too long for this review. However you will have fun spotting them in character.

The music, although a character in this presentation, does not overwhelm the dialog or the story:
""The Linden Tree""
""S'Rithe-Z&auml;uerli""
""Svetit Mesyats""
""Happy Birthday to You""
""Roses from the South""

I've been reading about the Balkans in connection with the 100th anniversary of WWI, and the film seemed to me to reflect the mix of culture and flaming politics fueled by religion and nationalism that led to WWI, the 80s crisis and the current conflict in Ukraine. (I know, Ukraine is not in the Balkans, but many of the issues are the same).

708196,5,6303482295,"The world of Wes Anderson is a strange place -- a place of slightly decayed elegance, wicked dark comedy and a light layer of bittersweetness.

And no movie seems to sum up that style as effectively as ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Anderson's eighth movie is like an antique music box -- an elaborate miniature world of smooth prettiness and Old World charm, with little dancing silver figures moving through their paces. The corkscrew quest of the main characters gets a bit slow at times, but the direction and acting are utter perfection.

A young girl appears at a cemetery monument, holding a book written by The Author (played by Jude Law as a young man, and Tom Wilkinson as an old one). The book tells of how he met the wildly wealthy Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham as a young man, and Tony Revolori as a young one) at the Grand Budapest Hotel, and Zero's explanation of why -- despite his vast wealth -- he stays in a tiny cramped room even though he owns the place.

In his youth, Zero was a lobby boy working under Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), the hotel concierge who also lavished... um, ""attention"" on rich elderly blonde ladies. When Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) dies on a trip back home, Gustave and Zero show up for the will reading... and everyone is shocked (and angry) that she left the priceless ""Boy with Apple"" painting to Gustave. Her thuggish son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) is particularly displeased.

So Gustave sneaks ""Boy With Apple"" out, only to be accused of poisoning Madame D and thrown in prison. Around this time, the country also breaks out into civil war. With Zero's unflagging help, Gustave may have a chance to escape prison... but can the duo also escape a brass-knuckled assassin (Willem Dafoe), avoid the fascist army, buck murder charges AND get the painting back?

""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is set in a Europe that never was. It's in a fictional country called Zubrowka, which seems to have a lot of snow, mountains and rich old ladies. This allows Wes Anderson to give the movie almost the air of a bittersweet fairy tale where happy endings don't last. Eventually someone dies, and all you can do is hold on to whatever memories of joy you once had.

But it's not all bittersweetness. Most of the story -- set within two separate frameworks -- is a wry, dark comic caper about serial murders and a valuable painting, which corkscrews around various wacky escapades before finally settling back at the titular hotel. Anderson wrings a lot of humor from the macabre (Deputy Vilmos Kovacs and his lost fingers), adding awkward whimsy into even the darkest escapade (""Who's got The Throat-Slitter?"").

And it's simply... beautiful. Beautiful like a storybook that doesn't have to be realistic. The alpine scenery, the quaint little towns, the strangely alluring Grand Hotel Budapest -- both in the past (elegant and luxurious without being rococo) and the past-present (a slightly decayed citadel, like an aging dowager). While Anderson sticks with his static, centered shots and sharp transitions, he still manages to linger on the slightly unreal beauty of his sets.

It's also one of the few movies that has an all-star cast that actually WORKS, rather than just racking up studio points. Ralph Fiennes is simply perfect as Gustave, a man who is all contradictions -- noble and scheming, kindly and selfish, an adventurer who truly cares for the people he takes advantage of. And he clicks perfectly with Revolori, who plays a squire to Fiennes' knight -- an earnest young lad whose ambition seems to be to be a slightly more moral version of Gustave.

And all the smaller roles work beautifully too -- an unrecognizable Swinton (seriously, you can't even tell it's her), Law, Abraham, Edward Norton as a Communist commander, Jason Schwartzman, Dafoe, Saoirse Ronan as Zero's beloved, Jeff Goldblum, and Adrien Brody as a tantrum-throwing thug who has just enough quiet menace to avoid being silly.

It will take considerable effort from Wes Anderson to top ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" -- an elegant, bittersweet little story within a frame whose gilding has started to flake off. Laugh, cry, and eat tiny little gourmet cakes.",1408406400,,4182,4.860955056179775

A perfect blend of dark humor, mystery, action, and suspense with just a hint of the sweet stuff, this movie keeps you on your toes. The way it is told is so brilliant, where a story is being told in a story (there isn't a lot of time hopping as others have mentioned, it's incredibly well explained and seamlessly done if you are paying attention). The story was a little tough to follow at a few points (some characters have similar features (sometimes on purpose), but there was always a recap that filled in any gaps or answered any of your questions a few minutes after any confusing scenes. That being said, I would highly recommend subtitles if you don't mind them, just to help keep track of foreign names and places.

If you're offended by naked paintings, swear words, or vulgar statements you may want to pass this movie up. Many commenters have complained about these things, but it is advertised as a dark film, is rated R, and no actual nudity is shown (just in case you were leery or wondering). It really is such an insignificant portion of the film, but recieves a large amount of attention in reviews so I thought I'd address it.",1408320000,2,1217,4.506787330316742

The story itself can be a little hard to follow,  at times--it requires mindful attention and, for me at least,  subtitles.  Personally,  I could have done without the most vulgar language (it added nothing,  and I found it out of character) and the ""substitute"" art piece (which I found offensive and, again, unnecessary), but those aspects of the movie aside, I enjoyed the show and, with only a little reservation,  can recommend it.",1408320000,,786,4.9465648854961835

Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe,  Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here.

While not Anderson's most profound film, it may be his most joyful.  I don't think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times.  And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well.  A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache.  Even my friends who don't enjoy Anderson's work in general had nothing but good things to say.  The sweetest treat of the movie year so far.",1408060800,,1157,4.922680412371134

As usual, the protagonist has a very youthful perspective on his past, but was clever enough to understand the motivations of all the adults around him.  The story, involving a contested will and a valuable painting, is simple.  But the constant changes of locations and supporting characters keeps the whole thing visually interesting.  It doesn't pack quite the same emotional punch of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" or ""Rushmore"" but compensates by being light and fun.",1407801600,,658,5.349514563106796

In my opinion, this only added to it's charm as you realized slowly who each cameo was! The story never dragged at any point and kept the pace moving without feeling rushed. There were some very over-the-top scenes that were reminiscent of old Peter Sellers movies (Pink Panther days). Finally, there was a feel throughout the production style that was distinctly European, and whether intentional or not only added to the experience.",1407801600,,598,5.05050505050505

The story was inspired by the works of Stefan Zweig- a famous Austro-Hungarian author who lived through the drama of WWI and died in 1942. Spans several decades as a story told by someone (T. Wilkinson) of a story that was told to him by someone (Murray Abraham) in his youth (played by Jude Law). Most of the action takes place in 1937 in the Grand Budapest Hotel, a stately luxury hotel with impecable service overseen by the legendary Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave befriends and basically adopts the newly hired bell hop- Zero and the adventure begins. Lots of cameo's and small bits form Adrian Brodie, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Ed Norton, Tilda Swinton and Owen Wilson.",1407628800,,878,4.814569536423841

The lead character is empathetic along with his protoge lobby boy.  The backdrop and costuming adds to the feel of this place of former elegence in an earlier time.  And the cameo appearances of many notable actors, both comedic and serious, adds to the story's interest.  The sections of computer enhanced animation, especially the downhill ski and sled chase after a mid-air transfer between cable cars at a high altitude resort, plus the overall wintry theme carried throughout the film gives it cohesiveness.  It has an engaging story, an interesting main character and his protoge, stylized supporting characters representing both good and evil and a semi-happy ending.

711783,4,6303482295,"Funny, great cast, good story telling, good pacing, visually interesting",1407024000,,72,6.3
711784,4,6303482295,"The first half of this movie seemed slow and tedious.  I had to take a break and wasn't really sure if I'd finish it or not.  After a day I came back to try another 15 minutes--and watched all the rest.  Some people probably just don't ""get"" this movie.  I take it as a subtle comedy, actually about World War I.  Forget the 1930's stuff--that's just a disguise.  This film was a joint British-German production, but seems more German than British.  I think more of the funding was German, much of the filming was done there, and when war breaks out, the symbols on the flags and uniforms are thinly disguised Third Reich imagery.
Like ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"", this comedy may not seem funny to some Americans who have become used to comedy with obligatory use of profanity and the inappropriate release of bodily fluids and gasses at the worst possible moments.  This movie has none of that and the humor is much more subtle.  Unlike Walter Mitty though, the underlying tone of which was optimistic, here the underlying tone is nostalgic and somewhat melancholic.

With respect to ""Bananas"" which he made decades ago, Woody Allen observed that it's hard to make a comedy about war and killing.  The Grand Budapest Hotel takes on the same task, with more restraint than Mr. Allen.  The hotel is a stand-in for dozens of pre-war institutions which catered to the wealthy elite, the staff showing even more stiff formality and etiquette than the elite themselves even used, without a chance of ever entering their ranks; the country (Zubrowka) a stand-in for any of the varied states comprising the Austro-Hungarian empire which, like several others, collapsed at the end of the war--and the fragments of which are still splintering even today.

One scene about 2/3 through the film, in which one man fires a pistol at another man on the opposite side of the hotel--causing all the other guests to look around in surprise, and then suddenly all pull out weapons of their own and begin firing at each other, until finally a police captain yells for everyone to stop shooting and demands to know precisely WHY they are shooting, which hardly anyone can even answer, perfectly symbolizes in comedic form the absurdity of the ""war to end all wars"".  I finished viewing this movie on August 2nd, which seems deeply symbolic to me since in a sense the 100th anniversary of World War I was exactly that day.  One could pick earlier dates: June 28th when the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo by a Bosnian Serb; July 28th when Austria declared war on Serbia and Russia began mobilizing troops, but real combat sprang into life August 2nd, 1914 when Germany invaded Luxembourg.

In addition to satirizing the war, the social stratification of pre-war society, and the national rivalries, I think I see other things here as well: the un-emancipated status of women; the prejudice against those of questionable ethnic backgrounds (which the concierge Gustav H. suddenly overcomes by fully embracing as a brother in spirit his pupil, the lobby boy ""Zero Mustafa"", showing a nobility of spirit which so many of both the elite and the other classes lacked.  The movie can get a bit frustrating as different scenes come from different time periods: here Mustafa is an elderly man explaining the past to a guest at the hotel, then he's a young lad just starting service, then he's de-facto running the hotel because Gustav has been imprisoned...it can get a bit bewildering.  Mr. Anderson, one really DOESN'T HAVE to tell a non-linear story just to prove that one is a clever director (or script writer).  Nevertheless, if you simply watch this movie as a comedy about pre-world-war I society, I think you'll enjoy it more and worry less about figuring out the exact storyline.  Another minor bother: WHY, in a film with SO MANY actors and actresses of such fame, is the Blu-Ray version so stingy as not to even offer SUBTITLES?  [Except where other languages are being spoken, in which case they automatically appear as English translations].  Lastly: there are some beautiful images here: both the hotel interiors, and some of the landscapes, glimpsed almost in passing, are magnificent.  Enjoy the show.",1407024000,,4226,4.855153203342619

711787,1,6303482295,"The fine critic Pauline Kael when critiquing a film back in the seventies when movies were movies and over-actors were nervous, that one can tell within a few minutes if the movie one is watching is directed by a master or a buffoon.  After a few minutes of this ""galloping to nowhere"" film the buffoonery could be cut with a chainsaw - at least one wishes that is what had happened to the original film stock.
  Anderson is not an acquired taste.  Directors such as David Lynch come under that leaky umbrella.  Anderson is a director who has yet to find a niche because no niche will have him.  His first two films were lightheartedly eccentric in a harmless enough way.  They were not so much films about anything as they were examples of atmosphere - airy and precious (in the derisive sense).
  This film resembles nothing so much as a cardboard cut out that may just as well have been gathered by high-schoolers.  Its only saving grace is the wild-eyed delirium displayed by Ralph Finnes as the concierge.  But even his part is hopelessly underwritten.  And where did they dig up the young man who plays Zero?  He doesn't speak his lines so much as ""read"" them.  One gets the impression someone is holding up cue cards for the poor soul behind the camera.  He seems surprised by every word he utters, and utters with a vacuousness little seen this side of Justin Beiber.
  Nothing comes together here.  ""The center cannot hold"".  Perhaps because the film lacks one.  Why use the framing device narrative style if there is no purpose in doing so?  We're already distanced from the action from its sheer imbecility.  The Coen Brothers might have been able to pull this off - they know zany humor and how to succeed in it (""Big Lebowski,"" ""Raising Arizona"") and they do it with panache rather than whimsy.  This could very well be the ""What's New Pussycat"" of the decade.  Too, I am not convinced that the actors who appear only  in one scene were never shown the script - they all seem not to have an idea of what is going on and so have no idea of how to play it. One wishes they had included a scene lifted from ""Blazing Saddles"" in which the Ralph Finnes character enters a taxi and screams ""Drive me out of this picture!!!""",1407024000,25,2230,4.487562189054726

In addition to relying on the music entirely to set the tone, we are alerted to the more meaningful utterances from the various actors by their decision to begin swearing. Mostly the same swear word repeated over and over again.

712998,5,6303482295,"When you watch this movie, you are reminded of the best films from the 1970's - Story driven, well written, well acted, and a bit odd.  The movie takes place in an old hotel which begins as a glorious place, and ends up as a shabby stop for the outcasts of society.  Of course, they all have tales to tell, and the one we are treated to is the tale of the owner.  It is told in flashbacks about how he came to own the hotel, and of his adventures with the concierge of the hotel, an odd and interesting man who has a habit of bedding older female guests.  The movie has a little bit of everything - Sex, lies, murder, love, war, and hilarious chase scenes.  The movie is funny in a dark way.  The humor comes from unexpected places and at unexpected times.  The dialogue is filled with colorful language, so don't be surprised to hear swearing that comes in when you least expect it to.  The movie is not for everyone.  Some will love it, and others will wonder what the heck is going on.

I was surprised at the box office names that popped up in different roles in the film.  While Ralph Fiennes held the main role and Tony Revolori (Zero) backed him up as his sidekick the story was told by F. Murray Abraham to Jude Law.  Popping up were Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Owen Wilson and a host of others.  The story is of a very popular consierge of the famous Grand Budapest Hotel who is framed for murder by the evil family of one of the elderly guests that he had entertained for the past 19 years.  And you know what I mean by entertained.  He had a thing for older ladies.  A little different, but pretty funny.  Warning for some strong language on occasion.",1406678400,,884,4.544303797468355

713935,2,6303482295,"""There is nothing new under the sun."" That ancient truth is becoming more obvious; and exemplified by these types of movies.
Redos of old stories have been done and even redone, but at least they make sense.
Rushmore is definitely one that is much more of a real story.
Do these films ""work"" better under the influence of certain chemicals or evidence of a smoking bong?
I watched Robocop from Redbox the other day and it was not great, but I felt like a real human watching a real movie and I didn't have to try to ""get it"" and I wasn't stoned.
However, Wes Anderson movies can be entertaining if you're in the mood for something different and unlaced.
Strange situations and quaint sets or dioramas might be fun or relaxing.
Maybe someone needs to get away from cookie cutter reality and have some real escapism.
Some entertaining actors just need a chance to act and voila, entertainment.
Jeff Goldblum for example, or Bill Murray, an excellent performer of understatement, if that's what it is.

I enjoy movies that aren't so typical hollywood -- definitely a foreign made film and the A-List cast is amazing!  It's a long list of A-List actors too! Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Harvey Keitel, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan (she played Susy Salmon from the Lovely Bones), Tilda Swinton, and many, many more!  It's funny, witty, silly ..  wonderfully executed.  I definitely recommend this movie!  It's not a chic flick .. no high action packed violence or drama .. and not stupid ""high school"" comedy similar to The Hangover movies ... just strange turns of events that leave you giggling and laughing at the absurdity of it all.  My difficult to please older parents (in their 80s) happily enjoyed this movie .. my son (who is 20) really liked this movie too!  People of all ages can watch this movie.  It is rated R -- for VERY brief nudity and nude artwork shown -- maybe 5 seconds total!  Some cursing .. but I think I could count all the ""naughty words"" on both hands.  There are inuendos, comments and depictions of sexual nature that may be inappropriate for anyone younger than 14-15 years of age for those parents that take care to screen what their children watch at home.  However .. these are very limited as they only describe more the character(s) and otherwise have little focus on the whole of the plot.  You'll not be disappointed!  Great for a fun movie night with friends or older teenage to adult family! If my son was 16 - I would definitely not object to him watching this movie -- maybe even 15.

Wes Anderson is a God, who makes perfect little worlds that he imagines in minute detail, then somehow translates them to the screen. It's like making a model of Disneyland from memory out of toothpicks-- a marvel apart and beyond reality.

The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's first golden-hued movie. Everything in it is uniquely the filmmaker's-- a style he's tweaked film to film without losing the essence of his peculiar whimsy. This movie, more than any of his previous, is everything wonderful about Wes Anderson, but with outright joy.

I've liked all his films, but if they have seemed weirdly moody and cryptic to you, this is your Wes Anderson movie. It's straight-up comedy, done with the feel of a finely illustrated fairytale, full of magic, and for grownups.",1406332800,,814,4.927007299270073

714816,5,6303482295,"It was definitely quirky and beautiful film. The backdrop is the real character in this movie, various colors and suitable for each situation. Even if this world seems quaint and unassuming it shows a gritty side with war, murder and revenge. The characters are all so unique from each other, and even with cast this big they certainly stand out. Gustav and Zero make a surprisingly convincing and even tender duo.

Some complained that the swearing seemed displaced but it is, that's what made it so funny in the first place. This poshly dressed characters with pristine accents, swearing like sailors(seldomly) was kind of off putting at first but when I finally get over the initial shock , I found myself giggling at Gustav's exclamations.

The nudity is so seldom, you barely catch a peek of any naughty bits, it wouldn't be too bad watching it with a teenager if you want a film viewing partner. Any more , I'd be spoiling the movie!

Story is basically about a Hotel and its employees and a inheritance of an item and all they are willing to go through to try to secure it from the opposition.  When I write it out like that it isn't too funny but trust me you will laugh.

Probably not for folks under 14-18 years old.  Has some sexual innuendo, foul language and violence.  This movie is for adults who want to go somewhere else for 2 hours and laugh and yet get involved in a good story.",1406160000,,673,4.130769230769231

True to Wes Anderson, there are so many details in the images and the dialog that multiple viewings is worthwhile, each at least as enjoyable as any viewing I've seen previously.  The music is so appropriate: Russian Balalaika Orchestra.  The movie so adroitly has NAZI analogs that appear.  The acting is awesome, too, and celebrity actors must have lined up for a role, however small, and each one of them was superb.  Fiennes, Abraham, and Revolori are standouts!

Small filigrees, touches and nods to films (and their soundtracks) like Soderberg's ""Kafka"", Roman Polanski films like ""The Tenant"" and ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and even Karel Zeman ""The Deadly Invention"" appear - the film looks and feels like something the Coen Brothers might have done in the spirit of ""Barton Fink"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" - set in a fictional early 1930's Eastern European Realm on the verge of Fascism.

And his cast! I love that he uses the same actors again and again, it's so fun to see them in each new reincarnation. Oh, Bill Murray...love!

717077,3,6303482295,"The Grand Budapest Hotel tells the story of concierge Gustave H. and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.

I was not familiar with this story or anything by Wes Anderson prior to watching this movie other than watching the preview of this which got me interested to watch. First off, this movie is loaded with quality actors, some even playing bit roles throughout the movie. The quality of the acting throughout was top notch.

This movie is cleverly written in its own unique, zany, whimsical almost straight laced way. It is not so much a typical laugh out loud comedy but more of a quickly paced clever dialogue reminding me a bit of a mix Monty Python or Young Ones type of comedy with a mix of French comedy. I didn't find myself laughing out loud so much but still enjoyed the story and the dark humor.

Not knowing what to expect, I found myself liking the movie throughout and found it to be a worthwhile watch. 3.5 stars",1405728000,8,959,4.5

717079,2,6303482295,"Started off interesting, went downhill fast. All sorts of supposedly slick dialogue that overall failed the more f words Fiennes used. Too bad...could have been something. Basically a chase movie with no character development and a really stupid plot. Fiennes plays the smooth, oily concierge at a ritzy European hotel who romances rich, elderly women. One dies and Fiennes gets part of her inheritance. She is thought to have been murdered, and Fiennes is implicated. Then he's chased by a collection of baddies. He has a friend from the hotel who helps him escape and narrates the story. Really a very poor film which almost put me to sleep.",1405728000,4,643,4.908256880733945

717187,2,6303482295,"This film was shoved out of the theaters and onto video discs in near record timenever a good sign.  Zero is the name of a major movie character and could also sum up the film.  There is much squandering of top acting talent (which seems--more of less--to be trying to avoid type-casting self-parody).  The story line is weak and the script often simply silly rather than clever farce.  The version on this disc is sometimes confusing and, consequently, the sequence of events can be difficult to follow (amidst all the dashing about).  The real/virtual interiors look spectacularly ornate (but the lobbies of what are supposed to be different hotels look suspiciously the same).  Miniatures look patently phony, and special effects cheesy.  But at least the closing credits are legible (a rarity) should you chose to read the below-the-line talent ads.  A disappointing, overly long film.  Probably best viewed at night, very late at night.  WILLIAM F. FLANIGAN, PhD.",1405728000,,968,5.069620253164557

717189,4,6303482295,"Although it has a rather ordinary story, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is told in an interesting way, and with some of the most picturesque cinematic images I've seen in recent years. The story is about Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), who is the concierge of the titular hotel. He takes a young immigrant boy, Zero, under his wing as his new lobby boy. Over the course of the movie they go on a series of adventures stemming from the death of one of Gustave's many lovers, Madame D (an almost unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) and a painting called ""Boy with Apple."" They also meet many colorful characters on the way, played by Wes Anderson's usual stable of actors. I must confess to not being the biggest Wes Anderson fan, and in fact, this is only the second of his films that I have seen, after BOTTLE ROCKET. There is a certain air of pretentiousness that one can feel about his work, like he's only making these films to amuse himself. Yet, there was a playfulness with this one and, in the end, a rather emotional turn that won me over. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the film and thought it was immaculately composed from a visual perspective. It was like every frame could be a perfect photograph, and this is definitely where Wes Anderson's strengths lie. I also enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters with which this film was populated. Though most of the big name actors who appeared here took what basically amounted to cameos, they brought a lot to the few scenes in which they appeared. As far as acting is concerned, everyone gave a great performance, especially Ralph Fiennes. Wes Anderson's flowery and poetic dialogue just flowed off of his tongue effortlessly, and with style. The actor who played a young Zero also did a fine job in his first role. Overall, I thought this was an excellent, if typical Wes Anderson film. The story does get a bit convoluted in the end, but the stylistic choices and the way you are enveloped in this fantasy world overshadows any weakness that the narrative has. A definite must-see, especially for Wes Anderson fans.",1405728000,,2060,4.662087912087912

Some fans like these best so it's all up to your tastes. For me though, like those films, BR to a lesser degree, the script is a little zany and tedious. It's fun but not nearly the adventure we had in Darjeeling or Fox nor the concise and innovative template set up with Tenenbaums. It also doesn't pull me in the way Moonrise Kingdom did either and is surely not the classic that Rushmore is and will always be.

He has truly developed his own style just as you can recognize a Tim Burton  or Guy Ritchie film.  It's also the brief cameos by Bill Murray and F.Murray Abraham that are the real cherry on the sundae. Wes has assembled a great bunch of actors and pulls the deepest quirkiness out of their performances.  i saw many 1 and 2 star reviews which means ""they just don't get it"".  I had to watch the Royal Tennenbaums many times before i was able to appreciate how unique it was.  Before then I too was ready to toss it away.  Hey, not all comedies deliver the same punch line!

717927,3,6303482295,"This is a funny one. In flashback, it starts out by evoking the vanished age of grand European hotels, patronized by the rich and titled, and staffed by a horde of highly disciplined career servants. The period seems to be between the Wars. The action revolves around the concierge of the Grand Budapest and an Indian (as in India) 'Lobby Boy' whom he has trained. Together they strive to claim a valuable painting which as been left to the concierge by one of his stately old clients, whose family feigns a patrician horror to cover what is simply old-fashioned greed. One of them pursues him relentlessly, and we watch an escape from prison and a melodramatic pursuit among snowy peaks. Meanwhile the hotel gradually gets shabbier and shabbier while it lives through a Nazi-like occupation and enters an increasingly egalitarian post-war world which has been stripped of the old traditions of deference to wealth and power. When we last see it in the Present, it is almost empty. What was disappointing about the film was the almost complete lack of character development. No one really seemed to change from the moment of their introduction, presumably in the 20s, to the end of the occupation, 30-odd years later, when everyone is essentially scattered or dead. And I, perhaps a bit dense, was confused about who the characters in the Present were supposed to be (a re-viewing might not come amiss).

718144,5,6303482295,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is one of the best films I have seen in recent
times. On the surface it is a comedy stuffed full of brilliant
one-liners: Ralph Fiennes, as the concierge M. Gustave, gets the chance
to play comedy, something he actually does very well. The plot is a
picaresque combination of the absurd and the entertaining; I
particularly enjoyed the prison-break sequence through the sewers,
spearheaded by chief convict Ludwig (Harvey Keitel), and the climactic
sequence where Gustave and his sworn enemy Dmitri (Adrien Brody)
become involved in a shooting-match in the hotel, where everyone seems
to be firing at everyone else with no real sense of purpose. Yet Wes
Anderson's film is also an elegy for a vanished way of life; that
bourgeois European world of dowagers and countesses, whose
indiscretions would be carefully hidden from public view by discreet
concierges like Gustave. The settings are quite breathtaking in their
grandioseness; the Budapest hotel, with its profusion of exterior
windows and restrained pink interiors, the dining-room covered with a
blood-red carpet, and the lobby full of pillars, evokes a world of
opulence and style. Together with cinematographer Robert Yeoman,
Anderson evokes a world of precise geometric shapes - the rectangular
pillars set against the rhombuses of the troops; the precise arches of
the door-frames and the exquisitely placed dining-tables, turning the
hotel dining-room into something resembling an examination hall in a
school. The impression communicated is one of a world precisely
ordered, both architecturally and socially - which is completely
destroyed by military interventions. When the young writer (Jude Law)
visits the hotel much later, and encounters the elderly Moustafa (F.
Murray Abraham), the building is on its last legs, a remnant of a
vanished world. Hence the film's last sequences assume a poignant tone,
especially when we learn what happened to Gustave. Based on material by
the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig (1881-1942), who was forced out of
Germany on Adolf Hitler's coming to power, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is
an elegy for a world blown apart by military invention. Highly
recommended.",1405468800,,2183,5.312138728323699

718237,5,6303482295,"I am a long time fan of many of Wes Anderson's movies although some have not worked for me. While I saw a few things in this one that seemed a hint sloppy (why is a ladder stored in front of a door, its distracting), they seem so trivial compared to the way this film transports the viewer to a place where I, maybe you, will feel nostalgic for a place and time I never experienced in real life. I have no love of imperial Europe of the 19th and early 20th century yet now, after living an adventure in Anderson's collection of amazing scenes and rooms and buildings and cities and decors, I am smitten and will ever long to go back to that place. I even was a bit disappointed with the 60s modern style that dominated the flash forward scenes because they lacked the ambiance of the earlier times and really, that is a kind of story telling I have never experienced.

With the Life Aquatic, previously my favorite film of his, Anderson created a maritime collection of views and mementos by crafting a small and friendly and slightly dangerous story among them. The boat opens up like a diagram in that film to expose all the interesting details.

With Moonrise Kingdom, New England homes and boy scout culture decorate a small but compelling love story with interesting complications and plenty of humor.

Grand Budapest features as many great actors as he could fit on screen and the story telling is Anderson's signature blend of serious to the characters and light-hearted for the viewer. This one has some gore so this is not for very sensitive viewers: guards killed in a bloody way, body parts that are comedic for adults but not for the very squeamish, but all told, this humorous tale has even more Wes Anderson originality and seemingly more budget than all the others before it. I have trouble imagining how he could top this but I sure hope he tries.",1405382400,,1863,4.538690476190476
718238,1,6303482295,"Well, I now have seen at least 5 Wes Anderson films, and I can say regretfully, I have disliked or even hated all of them.  I know many
if not most critics and viewers like or love his films, so I am in the minority here.  I especially dislike farces, which this and most of his
films are, and I hate deadpan, which all of them are, especially ""Moonrise Kingdom""  (Gagggggg!)  While his sets are truly beautiful and
artistically quaint, his centering everything and doing many scenes in a kaleidoscopic manner I find too cutesy.  It's like he is telling us
how clever he is.  I generally dislike when a director's style so pervades every scene and scripted line, it never seems like any character
is anything but an extension of the director.  I was torn here between a 1 and 2 star rating, but settled on 1 because I agitated myself
just writing this.",1405382400,44,852,4.458064516129032
718239,5,6303482295,"Not since ""The Book Thief"" have I been so entertained by a movie that knows how to create art. Rather than mention the plot, I will say that the language flowed with grace and humor. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) our main character had the ability to be classy while being crude. The harpsichord soundtrack fit well into the production. One could see where classical action/comedy/romance films of the 50's and 60's have influenced the film until it spoofs them in a generic fashion. Even minor characters like Saoirse Ronan are carefully crafted with odd flaws, such as her facial birthmark shaped like Mexico.

Gustave describes sex as ""eating steak."" His affairs with older women he claims, ""The cheaper cuts are more flavorful."" He is also a lover of poetry and writes poems and speaks poetically with a way that amuses the audience.

While the film has a classic look and sound to it, the humor is suited for a younger audience.",1405382400,4,927,4.7875
718240,3,6303482295,"No spoilers!  There wouldn't be any use for a ""spoiler"" anyway because what plot there is will be comprehended by even a dull viewer in the first 20 minutes.  No, this is a case of an All-Star cast curiously misused on a silly little series of vignette ""funnies"", sight-gags, and  occasionally funny ""schlemiel/schlemazel"" send-up's.

At rare times the movie is subtle, with even a few (just a few) moments that will remind you of the puckish, intellectual wit of Director Richard Lester in ""A Hard Day's Night"", and ""Help"".  But these are too diluted by the syllogistic sight-gag formula that we see done-to-death in nearly every comedy (or comedy wanna-be) today.

For me, this is my favorite comedy of all time.  It is perfectly paced and perfectly executed.  Ralph Fiennes is exquisite in this role.  The movie plays like a fine symphony with Anderson as a once-in-a-lifetime conductor who knows how to get that perfect pitch and pace.

I absolutely adore this movie.",1405296000,,649,4.8545454545454545

actually in this film are not given top billing. Jude Law is a prominent character.
I'm not sure because it happened so fast, but I think George Clooney sticks
his head out a door for a fraction of a second. Half the fun of the movie is
catching the subtleties.",1405296000,,333,4.21875
719097,4,6303482295,"There was a nagging mismatch here.  Partly because of Wes Anderson's  cinematic style that is eye-candy.  His excessively compulsive need for symmetry in his sets outdoes even Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining,"" but that's just an observation.  I actually like the abstractness of it, and with his pulsating palette of complements, it's kind of, well, snappy.  Otherwise his recipes for plots need some je ne sais qua to really stick to your ribs.  After you get over the buoyancy of the production, there's nothing else there.
Oh yeah, the other thing was there's no way I can accept his depiction of a middle-Europe, done convincingly actually, but with Americans and a couple of Brits using familiar Anglo-Saxon phrases, so out-of-place.  They should have cussed in French or the like.  The new kid who played the Lobby Boy learned his craft from watching Robt. Bresson's ""Pickpocket,"" if you know what I mean.",1405296000,,910,5.02

But it gradually dawned on me that this was a Wes Anderson film, and as with the few others I've seen (most notably Moonrise Kingdom), its over-the-top stylized nature grew tiresome (as did the surprising number of ""f-bombs"").

Jeff Goldblum's presence was another strike against this film. That's a matter of personal taste - his sardonic-voiced characters always annoy me.

I stopped watching this downloaded movie a little before the halfway point. My wife stuck with it for another 20 minutes or so, but she finally gave up on it too.

It was filled with gem after gem of off beat humour, hideous makeup and all the thrills of surprise craziness.  This movie provves that timing is definitely the essence of comedy.
